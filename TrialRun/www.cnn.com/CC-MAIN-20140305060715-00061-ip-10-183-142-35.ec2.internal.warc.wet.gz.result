Ex-Pentagon official defends 'harsh treatment'Story Highlights Former undersecretary Douglas Feith denies torture condoned in interrogations Insiders say Feith was a key architect of Bush administration's interrogation policy Feith tells subcommittee that nudity, dogs can be used in "humane fashion" Court upholds enemy combatant's detention while allowing him to challenge captivity Next Article in Politics » WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former top Pentagon official defended the Bush administration's treatment of prisoners, saying its policies prohibited torture during interrogations. "The fact is, we had a clear policy from the top of this government that was against torture, against illegality, against inhumane treatment," Douglas Feith told a House Judiciary subcommittee Tuesday. Feith served as undersecretary of defense for policy in President Bush's first term. Feith is one of six current and former Bush administration officials identified by former State Department official Lawrence Wilkerson as having developed the legal rationale for subjecting Taliban and al Qaeda captives to harsh treatment. Critics say the policies led to the use of torture by U.S. interrogators. Feith concurred with a December 2002 memorandum that recommended the approval of stress positions, dogs and nudity during interrogations, saying it was possible to apply them in a "humane fashion" in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. "There were important legal lines that everyone understood could not be crossed," he said. The policies have been the focus of a series of congressional hearings in recent months. In June, retired U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba, who led the Army's investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003, wrote there "is no longer any doubt" that the Bush administration committed war crimes in its treatment of suspected terrorists.

"The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account," Taguba wrote in the preface to a June report by a Massachusetts-based human rights group. The subcommittee's Republicans criticized the inquiry. The panel's ranking Republican member, Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, accused the majority Democrats of holding hearings "dedicated primarily to making sure we are protecting the rights of terrorists." Invoking the September 11, 2001, attacks, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said officials crafted the policy "while that smoking hole in New York was still burning." "It's inappropriate for us to bring people up and turn them slowly on a spit because there are people on this committee that despise this administration," he said. But subcommittee chairman Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, whose New York district was the center of the attacks, said laws cannot be ignored in "difficult circumstances." "No one can take the position that our law against torture or any other laws can be set aside at the whim of an administration which thinks that's the best way to deal with the challenges with which we are faced," Nadler said. In a separate matter involving detainees, a closely divided appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, on Tuesday issued a pair of 5-4 decisions regarding a detainee's right to challenge his incarceration. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government may continue to detain Ali al-Marri in the Navy brig in Charleston, South Carolina, but he has the right to challenge that detention. "If the government's allegations about al-Marri are true, Congress has empowered the president to detain him as an enemy combatant," the majority declared. However, the court then ruled against the government, concluding "al-Marri has not been afforded sufficient process to challenge his designation as an enemy combatant." Al-Marri's lawyers have continued to challenge the government's decision to hold him in military custody, saying he was not captured on a battlefield. He was initially taken into custody in Illinois in December 2001 on fraud charges unrelated to terrorism. "While the decision rejects the president's claim of unchecked executive power, it still poses a grave danger to the most basic constitutional principle -- that citizens and legal residents of the U.S. can be locked up without charges," al-Marri's lawyer, Jonathan Hafetz said.

Marine motorcycle deaths top their Iraq combat fatalitiesStory Highlights 25 Marines killed on motorcycles in past 12 months, compared with 20 killed in Iraq Top Marine official: "The Marines are very serious about" addressing problem All but one of the deaths have involved super-fast sport bikes Marines have recently implemented a mandatory sport-bike course Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO From Larry Shaughnessy CNN Pentagon Producer QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Motorcycle accidents have killed more Marines in the past 12 months than enemy fire in Iraq, a rate that's so alarming, it has prompted top brass to call a meeting to address the issue, officials say. Despite crashes, Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker rides a sport motorcycle. "I enjoy it. ... It relaxes me," he says. Twenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. In that same period, 20 Marines have been killed in action in Iraq. The 25 deaths are the highest motorcycle death toll ever for the Marine Corps. Gen. James Amos, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told CNN that commanders are trying to drill down on what "we need to do to help our Marines survive on these sport bikes." "The Marines are very serious about it," he said. Watch these aren't your father's Harleys » Marine Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker knows all too well about the dangers of sport bikes. An owner of a Kawasaki Ninja, Tucker has had two crashes, and the second one nearly killed him. "I sustained a broken collar bone; I tore the shoulder out of the socket; I tore three ligaments in the shoulder, the rotator cuff; I broke three vertebrae," said Tucker, a drill instructor for new officers. "The worst was a head injury I received: a bruised brain. And it caused hemorrhaging, and from that I had partial paralysis of the left leg, full paralysis of the left foot and toes, and that was for approximately six months."

Amos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday "focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues." The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, and other senior leadership will attend the meeting at the Quantico, Virginia, Marine base, he said. About 18,000 of the nearly 200,000 Marines are believed to own motorcycles, Amos said. The Marines have taken some measures. The Marine Corps has had a long-standing policy for all Marines who ride motorcycles to take a mandatory basic riding course. More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes. Any Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say. On a recent day at the Quantico training track, Marines whizzed by on their bikes. "I think the basic rider course has been great," said Cpl. Austin Oakley. "Here, they put you in situations you want to be wary of out in that open road." Oakley said he recently returned to the United States from Japan, and he immediately jumped at the chance to buy a sport bike. He said it's not uncommon for Marines to have motorcycle clubs within their units. "We'll go out on rides together. Fridays for lunchtime, we'll all meet up and go to lunch," Oakley said. "When I get on my motorcycle, it's me and the motorcycle. I don't need to go fast. I don't need to do anything like that. It's just being free." The rise in motorcycle deaths isn't confined to Marines. The Navy says it's had 33 deaths on motorcycles over the past 12 months, a 65 percent jump from the previous time period. And authorities say motorcycle deaths have been a problem in the civilian world, too. Military officials say they're not sure why the deaths are on the rise. They initially believed that the accidents might involve mostly young Marines and sailors about 18 or 19 years old. But Navy statistics show that five of the victims were 25, the most prevalent of any age involved in the crashes. And two 40-year-old sailors were killed in motorcycle crashes. Amos said the Marines have seen a similar trend. But he says the new training seems to be working: Of the 300 young men and women who have gone through the sport-bike course, only three have had accidents. The safety course instructors said some Marines who go through the training decide the sport bike is not for them. But even some Marines who've survived past crashes still want to ride again, even after they get the new training. "I enjoy it," said Tucker. "I can actually get on my motorcycle and ride, and it's just like if I were to do bowling or rock climbing or scuba diving. It's something for me. It relaxes me."

Commentary: Obama should think small on health care reformStory HighlightsJohn Feehery: Architect Daniel Burnham said "make no small plans"He says Obama administration is pressing for a complete health care overhaulFeehery: History shows presidents have failed to achieve universal careHe says Obama should think small and adopt bipartisan approachNext Article in Politics » By John Feehery Special to CNN	Editor's note: John Feehery worked as a staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients including News Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the United States Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. John Feehery says history shows big health care reforms proposed by presidents usually fail. (CNN) -- President Obama has taken the advice of famous Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. "Make no little plans," Burnham said, "they have no magic to stir men's blood." The president has called for the complete restructuring of education in this country. He wants to recast the energy industry. He promises to tackle the looming problem of Social Security and Medicare. He wants to raise taxes on the rich and give money to the poor. He plans on redoing the banking and investment industries. He has even weighed in on the college football bowl system. But when it comes to another of his ambitions, health care reform, history shows that it is the littler plans that usually get done. The president certainly has big ambitions when it comes to health care. He wants to boldly restructure the insurance market so that everybody is covered. He also wants to dramatically cut costs so that everybody can afford to get the health care they need. But universal access doesn't necessarily go with cutting costs. And having the government control every aspect of the health care delivery system not only will inhibit creativity and progress, it will also cost a lot of money. And there is the nagging question of how to pay for it all. Congress has rejected a couple of the president's revenue raisers, including a plan to nick charitable contributions and to take away the mortgage deduction for some homeowners. I am going to give the president and some of his team some unsolicited advice: Think smaller. And think bipartisan. Don't Miss Commentary: What's driving U.S. over a cliff?
Feehery: Liking Obama, opposing White House
In Depth: Commentaries
The experience of the past hundred years of health care reform suggests that efforts to nationalize the whole industry usually fail, but smaller, discrete bites of the apple usually succeed. As part of his Square Deal program, Teddy Roosevelt, the man who preached the doctrine "walk softly and carry a big stick," promised universal health care. But when he ran on such a plank in 1912, it certainly didn't help him win. When Harry Truman decided to try to nationalize health care after World War II, he ran into the buzz saw known as the American Medical Association. Bill Clinton made another run at universal health care when he got elected in 1992. I was working for House Minority Leader Bob Michel at the time, and Republicans were very concerned about how they would counter the president's wife and his big majorities in the House and the Senate. As often happens in one-government rule, the Democrats over-reached. Hillary Clinton created a task force and then came up with an incredibly complex piece of legislation that was easily lampooned by the Republicans. They were able to work with provider groups and insurance companies to come up with a simple alternative that appealed to moderate and conservative Democrats who didn't like the heat they were getting from the provider groups and didn't like Mrs. Clinton much, either. The effort collapsed. But the issue didn't go away. There are plenty of examples of success when the expectations are scaled back and where specific problem areas are targeted. For example, Medicaid and Medicare, created in the 1960s, were aimed at discrete groups (the poor and the elderly) who quite clearly needed some help with their health care expenses. In the late 1990s, health care portability was identified as a problem. The result was HIPAA, and it was passed with a bipartisan majority and wouldn't have happened without a partnership between former Republican Rep. Dennis Hastert (he was a whip at the time) and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy. It also became clear during that time that too many kids weren't getting access to health care. It is hard to be against giving more health care access to kids. The result was the State Children's Health Insurance Program. It was passed with a bipartisan majority and, in fact, was initially pushed by Republicans. Around the turn of the century, another need was identified. The Medicare program didn't include a prescription drug benefit. The grass-roots efforts were pretty straightforward: Seniors wanted help in paying for the drugs that kept them alive. It was the most difficult vote I have ever seen in my life. You wouldn't think spending $400 billion would be that hard. But it was. Conservatives didn't want to expand government with a new expensive entitlement. The Democratic leadership didn't want to give Republicans a victory, especially on an issue as popular as prescription drugs, and although there was bipartisan support, ultimately, for the final bill, it was a hard-fought bipartisanship. And when the vote came on the House floor, it was basically a tie for three hours. Three hours while opponents scrambled to kill it. Three hours while proponents scrambled to pass it. It was truly a remarkable compromise and an impressive accomplishment. And it remains a popular program that actually saves lives. I go through this history because I think it helps put the current debate in some perspective. Passing universal health care is hard -- and perhaps impossible. If it were easy, it would have been done by now. Taking incremental steps is more effective and usually more successful. And trying to craft a bipartisan solution is essential. The president and his team have learned a few things from the Clinton experience. First, they have shied away from creating a huge bureaucracy that will scare the public. Second, they don't have a controversial figure, like a Hillary Clinton, driving the process. Third, they have decided to let Congress lead the process, not the administration. And fourth, they are working hard to get some buy-in from the business community. But those aren't the only lessons to learn from past efforts. The Obama administration and its allies need to remember that pushing a product that is too big and too partisan may lead to its doom. They have seemingly decided to adopt health care under budget reconciliation, a procedural maneuver that allows it to pass with a simple majority, making the Republicans irrelevant to the process. And they still seem intent on their big plans. Daniel Burnham was a great architect, and his admonition to "make no little plans" may fit well when it comes to building a city. But when it comes to building a health care policy that can get enacted, if history is any judge, making small, bipartisan plans is the surer way to success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.

Can the House trust the Senate?By John Feehery, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSHealth bill passage may require House Democrats to trust Senate DemocratsHouse could make politically difficult vote on theory that Senate would modify law laterJohn Feehery says there's a long history of mistrust between the two chambersHe says senators have lofty ambitions and more prerogatives

Government and Politics
Editor's note: John Feehery worked for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients such as News Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. Washington (CNN) -- When the Founding Fathers decided to create a bicameral legislative branch, they were trying to make things difficult for the federal government to grab power from the people. What the Founding Fathers may not have foreseen was how much the House and the Senate would grow to dislike and distrust each other. Why is this important now? Democrats in the House may have to take the political risk of voting to pass the health care bill based on assurances from the Senate that the upper chamber will eventually modify the law to change some things House Democrats don't want. I live a bipartisan household. I am a creature of the House, having spent 15 years toiling as a Republican staffer in the lower chamber. My wife is a Senate girl, having spent about the same amount of time as a Republican staffer in the upper chamber. Talk about Mars and Venus. When you are working for the House majority, you worry less about the tactics of the minority and more about the workings of an inscrutable Senate. Former Speaker Tip O'Neill reportedly once said to a Democratic colleague: "Remember, the House Republicans are merely the opposition. The Senate is the enemy." Two examples come quickly to mind. Right after Bill Frist became majority leader in the Senate in 2003, President Bush and House Republicans were pushing for a tax cut of a certain size, which they thought would stimulate an economy that was faltering. To do so, both the House and Senate needed to pass a budget resolution that included that sizeable tax cut number. The House passed the budget, and all eyes were on the Senate majority leader, who was having some trouble convincing a few wayward senators to climb on board the tax cut train. Suddenly, a deal was struck, and the Senate passed the budget. But nobody in the House knew exactly what the deal was. Rumors started floating around that Frist had promised the few moderates who didn't like the high cost of the tax cut to only allow a tax cut of half the size being pushed by the president and by House Republicans to pass the Senate. The House Republicans were, to put it politely, outraged. They fulminated and fomented. They accused the new majority leader and the new budget chairman (Don Nickles) of treachery, of cowardice, and worse, of being squishes. And they spent the next six months trying to come up with a plan to screw the dastardly Senate. In October 2001, just after the September 11 terrorist attacks, a jittery congressional leadership went to the White House to meet with the president. At the early morning meeting, Sen. Tom Daschle divulged that his office had received a powdery substance that looked just like the anthrax that had been sent to news broadcasters in New York City. If it was the same anthrax, it could be deadly, especially if it got into the Capitol building air ducts. All four leaders agreed to close down the Capitol to protect the lives of the employees who worked there. Speaker Denny Hastert and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt dutifully told their House colleagues of the plan, and they shut down their side of the Capitol. When Daschle and Sen. Trent Lott went back to brief their colleagues about the plan, there was a rebellion. Sen John McCain was especially obstinate, saying basically that closing the Capitol was the same as surrendering to terrorists. Without telling Hastert and Gephardt, the Senate announced that it was staying open. The headline in the New York Post the next morning blared "WIMPS," calling the speaker and the House a bunch of cowards for trying to protect their staff from an anthrax attack. I never had so much fun in my life working with my House Democratic counterparts launching a furious counterattack in the media against the upper chamber. My former boss, Speaker Hastert, who had nothing but disdain for the Senate, used to call senators those "prancing ponies who all wanted to be president." And the Senate, from what my wife tells me, holds the House in similarly minimal high regard. The question that now roils the House is: Can they trust the Senate? Could they trust them when the House, during President Bill Clinton's first term, passed a politically very dangerous BTU tax, a new tax based on energy consumption? Dozens of vulnerable Democrats voted for the president's budget that included that tax, only to see it stripped by the Senate. The answer, sadly, is no. The Senate is going to do what it is going to do. It is going to get as much done as it can get done, with the limitations it has under its rules. And if it sees a chance to stick it to the House, believe me, it will. The difference between the House and the Senate is this: Members of the House who have power and positions of authority have already put in the time and energy to be House people. Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner have no interest in moving up to the Senate. They are going to fight for the prerogatives of their colleagues and of their institution. Most senators still believe, in the back of the their minds, they will be or should be president. They are always looking for ways to play to the cameras and increase their national prominence. Aside from the egos and the ambition of those in the upper body, there are also the rules. The Senate rules give more power to individual senators and more power to the minority. That tradition has been around for a long time, so that the Senate doesn't just become a smaller version of the House. It was created to give states, especially in less populous regions, an ability to protect themselves from the demands of the more populous regions of the country. It is on big bills, like the health care reform legislation now being considered by the House and the Senate, where the stresses between the House and the Senate become more pronounced. House members are now asking themselves: Can we trust the Senate? If we pass their bill, will they pass ours? If we go out on a limb for them, will they change their Senate rules for us? Well, as President Ronald Reagan used to say about the old Soviet Union: Trust. But verify. Which really means don't trust them at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.

Sending out an SOS for 'America's flagship'
By Sarah Hoye, CNN
updated 7:44 AM EDT, Sun April 7, 2013
In the 1950s and '60s, the ocean liner SS United States was the choice of movie stars, famous musicians and kings. Supporters are trying to save this storied ocean liner from the scrap heap. It's seen here in the U.S. Virgin Islands during its heyday.
The SS United States powered through rough weather on a regular basis. On its first voyage, it set a trans-Atlantic speed record -- three days, 10 hours and 42 minutes -- a feat that has never been surpassed.
The vessel stretched as long as the height of the famous Chrysler Building -- more than 100 feet longer than the Titanic. It's shown here returning to New York after a voyage.
Legendary band leader and composer Duke Ellington often commanded the stage aboard the ship, which was so safe it was said to include a fireproof piano.
Actor Marlon Brando signed this photo of himself aboard the ship with artist Salvador Dali.
Monaco's Prince Rainier and his princess, the former Hollywood star Grace Kelly, were guests aboard the ship.
Entertainer Jackie Gleason, center, hangs out aboard the SS United States in this undated photo.
Passengers were drawn to the unique comforts of the SS United States, including custom-designed furniture and top-notch dining.
In 1955, long before ship-board movie theaters were commonplace, the SS United States showed films in the popular CinemaScope widescreen format.
By 1969, trans-Atlantic airlines were hurting the ocean liner business. The SS United States was mothballed.
The ship has been anchored in Philadelphia for 17 years. It's been stripped of most of its beautiful interior furnishings.
Susan Gibbs, granddaughter of late ship designer William Francis Gibbs, is determined to save the SS United States. Keeping the ship afloat costs nearly $80,000 a month for basic maintenance, insurance and security. Supporters hope to save the SS United States by transforming it into a stationary entertainment complex and museum. Otherwise, its owners will be forced to sell it for scrap metal.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Historic ocean liner SS United States is running out of money and may have to be scrapped
Ship designer's granddaughter: "We have to save her"
Supporters hope to make the ship a stationary entertainment complex and museum
The ship set the trans-Atlantic speed record, hosted stars like Grace Kelly, Duke Ellington
Philadelphia (CNN) -- For me, touring the SS United States felt kind of like I was exploring my grandmother's attic for the first time, not knowing what I'd find.
The ship offers lots of room for surprises. It stretches the length of New York's Chrysler Building and is 100 feet longer than the Titanic.
Its legendary decks were the site of untold stories, where movie stars rubbed shoulders with famous musicians and kings.
And it's fast. On its first voyage, the SS United States set a trans-Atlantic speed record -- three days, 10 hours and 42 minutes -- a feat that has never been surpassed.
SS United States could be sold for scrap
The ship's late designer William Francis Gibbs constructed the vessel with fireproof materials, saying, "You can't set her on fire, you can't sink her, and you can't catch her."
Now, six decades after its heyday, the vessel dubbed "America's flagship" is in need of a rescue. Expensive maintenance may force the owners to sell the historic ship for scrap metal, unless a solution can be found.
During my tour through the dark and damp shell of former grandeur, the vastness of Gibbs' creation became even more evident.
Gibbs, a naval architect responsible for nearly 5,500 Navy vessels that helped win World War II, put everything he had into his ultimate ship. The 2,200-passenger liner also was meant to double as a troop transport ship if war broke out.
Gibbs' obsession with creating the perfect ocean liner has now transformed into his granddaughter's obsession with saving it.
"My grandfather was once asked who do you love more, this ship or my grandmother, and he said, 'the ship, a thousand percent,' " said Susan Gibbs, executive director of the SS United States Conservancy. "This is an extraordinary American achievement, an amazing expression of our post-war history, and it would be so tragic to see it destroyed."
Standing in the sunlight flooding the hefty enclosed promenade, Gibbs admits she never traveled aboard "The Big U."
"I didn't know my grandfather. He died when I was young," she said, gazing out the floor-to-ceiling windows. "But I've gotten to know him through this ship. His spirit is here."
"He felt this was the perfect ship and loved what she said about the nation. He saw the ship as a metaphor for the nation's post-war strength, pride and accomplishment."
Gibbs remembers traveling to Philadelphia from her home in Washington to see the SS United States for the first time. Along the way, she read her grandmother's diary out loud in the car.
The journal revealed tales about the ship's maiden voyage and a joyful conga line celebrating the new speed record. It unveiled a bygone era when passengers donned mink stoles and enjoyed a liquor selection that included 49 kinds of scotch.
Full of nostalgia, Gibbs snapped back to reality when the car edged closer to the dock. She gasped at her first sight of the weathered ship.
"When I walked on board, it was only a shadow of that," she said. "I was saddened, but determined that we cannot let the ship go."
Walking through the ship's empty belly, I can feel that sadness too. Gone are the stately furnishings and decorations. All that remain of the cabins are outlines on the floor, accompanied by plugged toilet holes.
It was hard not to feel like I was trespassing on property that was ransacked. Only this was no robbery -- the ship's interior fittings were auctioned off in the '80s.
Despite the missing fittings, the SS United States remains nothing less than majestic.
The longer I was on the ship, the easier it was to imagine it full of life. I could picture Marlon Brando chatting with artist Salvador Dali in the ballroom; hear Duke Ellington on stage tickling the ivories on one of the ship's fireproof pianos; or watch President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy strolling on the decks.
This is going to create jobs and be the crown jewel of a waterfront district.Dan McSweeney, SS United States Redevelopment Project
Dan McSweeney's father worked as a steward on the SS United States. Today, he oversees the liner's redevelopment project and is looking for partners to help save it.
Out of service since 1969, the former reserve ship for the U.S. Navy has been docked in Philadelphia since the mid-1990s.
The goal is to turn it into a stationary entertainment complex and museum.
"It's an irreplaceable part of American history, and once it's gone, it'll never come back, and we'll never have anything like it in the future," said McSweeney, managing director of the SS United States Redevelopment Project. "It's not a vanity project. This is going to create jobs and be the crown jewel of a waterfront district."
"If we lose it, we'll never get it back."
For now, the clock is ticking.
Keeping the ship afloat costs nearly $80,000 a month for basic maintenance, insurance and security.
The SS United States Conservancy launched a website where visitors can sponsor a piece of the ship for $1 per square inch.
Gibbs says they have about two months before they'll have to sell the ship for scrap -- something she won't even allow herself to think about.
"Its name is the SS United States, and she's been here (in Philadelphia) for 17 years because she's not done yet," Gibbs said. "We have to save her."
As Gibbs and I found our way off the ship, my shoes crackled against the crumbling, faded green surface of the outside deck -- like walking across an abandoned tennis court.
We waved goodbye, and I wandered across the dock and turned around. Tilting my head back as far as I could, I stared up at her mighty bow.
I couldn't help but notice the ship's towering sides were stained with streaks of rust -- the tears of a once proud iron lady.

A beauty beyond skin deep
By Debbi Wynn, CNN
updated 1:19 PM EDT, Wed April 17, 2013
Penny Loker, 31, was born with two birth defects -- hemifacial microsomia and Goldenhar Syndrome -- that left her with a disfigured face. Loker endured multiple surgeries and lengthy recoveries as a child. But she never lost her positive attitude, according to her sister.
Loker didn't realize how different she was until she started school. At home, she was treated the same as everyone else.
Penny calls her core group of friends her "rocks." From left, Laura, Penny, Linda, Suzanne and Becky.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Birth defects left Penny Loker with a disfigured face
Growing up, she endured cruel treatment from others
She wishes she could open the dialogue and educate others about malformations
Loker wants to be a wife and mother, but accepts that may never happen
Editor's note: We first met Penny when she wrote to us about a CNN photo gallery showcasing disfigured children and stillborn babies affected by Agent Orange in Vietnam. Penny spoke of the anger and sadness she felt over seeing CNN's "viewer discretion" warning on the gallery. She was born with a disease that left part of her own face malformed and felt compelled to reach out to us about the children who simply look different. "How can I not speak up about this?" she asked. "If not me, who will speak on behalf of these children?" We invited her to educate us all by sharing her story and allowing us to see the world through her eyes. (CNN) -- As a little girl, she never got a valentine at school parties.
As a teenager, she never had a best friend, a boyfriend or a date.
As a woman, she's never had a relationship. She's never been kissed.
Her dream to one day become a wife and mother is fading as she grapples with the reality that it may never happen.
Penny Loker, 31, was born with hemifacial microsomia and Goldenhar Syndrome, two birth defects that left her with a disfigured face. Hemifacial microsomia causes a malformation of the ear and/or the structure of the lower jaw. Goldenhar Syndrome is a congenital condition that produces abnormalities of the head and the bones of the spinal column. It usually affects the appearance of eyes, ears, facial bones and the mouth.
Both conditions are complex, as are their names. But for a little girl facing a big world, the names were simple: Monster. Ugly. Freak.
Loker was raised in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in a home where love and acceptance were given freely.
Her father died soon after Loker's first birthday. Her mother, a strong, loving woman, readily took on the challenge of raising Loker and her sisters. That included arranging for multiple surgeries at hospitals far from home.
Loker's recoveries were lengthy and painful, recalls older sister Crystal Loker. "But even then Penny had a positive attitude. She was a trouper who kept her smile and didn't complain."
'Impaired Perceptions': Photographer rejects first impressions
At home, Loker's looks were not an issue and she was treated the same as her sisters. She knew she looked a bit different, and she knew it caused her to be in the hospital a lot, but she had a child's innocence and accepted it as normal.
When it was time to start school, she discovered how different she actually was. She spent a lonely childhood excluded from nearly everything. She had no friends. She accepted the name-calling as part of her life and seemed to understand that crying or fighting back only made it worse. So she quietly endured it.
She remembers that pain and humiliation well. "As an adult, it's hard to stand by silently when you know what these kids are going through," Loker says. "But it's equally difficult to speak out when you don't feel empowered to do so."
As she got older, the name-calling was more often behind her back than to her face. By the time she reached high school, she had learned there would be no friends, parties or dates for a girl who looked like a freak.
"It hurt, but there was nothing I could do to change it," she says.
While day-to-day encounters with strangers brought the same hurtful stares and comments, Loker was used to it. Then came a day with such cruelty it remains a vivid memory.
"For graduation my sister gave me a gift certificate for a manicure and pedicure. I'd never had one before, and it was a wonderful experience. I left the spa feeling truly pretty for the first time in my adult life."
But less than a block from the salon, she encountered a carload of boys who slowed to look at her and began pointing and calling her names.
Distraught, she walked as quickly as she could to get away from them, thinking all the while that she was not beautiful after all.
"The pretty nails made no difference at all. Shamed and humiliated, I realized I was still the same girl that everyone made fun of," she recalls. "I remember that day as one of the worst."
Talking to someone with a chronic illness
But time can ease all wounds, and her determined spirit taught her to find the good around her.
She has a core group of girlfriends and relatives who cherish her as she is. She speaks proudly of being able to provide for herself, thanks to her job at Rogers Communications, where she spends her days handling customer requests. The company was recognized this year as a diversity leader corporation, a recognition that only adds to Loker's pride.
There are many adventures in life that she is hesitant to embrace, even though she is physically able. She prefers not to shop alone. She has never been on a true vacation, saying the thought of one is scary.
Yet it's a feat she is determined to accomplish. She is saving now for a trip to California to visit either BlizzCon or Comic-con.
"I'm kind of a geek and play the online MMO World of Warcraft with my sister and her husband, and we always talk about how cool it would be to go there," she says. "People dress up so I would feel 'normal', not out of place."
She's quick to point out she has no interest in visiting a theme park geared toward children, where she'd likely be subjected to stares as parents attempt to answer questions about her.
She wishes she could open the dialogue about individuals with malformations by educating people, especially children, whose natural curiosity can eventually become cruelty if left unaddressed.
"Educating them early on would help them learn to be more tolerant of others who are different. The ability to love, share, bring happiness and help others is the real beauty of a person," she says.
"The exterior doesn't necessarily reflect the beauty that often lives inside. And when people fail to remember that, they can miss out on the love and friendship of a truly special person."
Crystal Loker agrees. "Penny is truly beautiful. She's always seeing the best in others and never has an unkind word for anyone. In Penny's world, others always come first. She's full of laughter and smiles. When you spend a day with her, you go home feeling good about yourself."
Loker welcomes the opportunity to teach all of us to see beyond the surface. But until then, she continues to hope for good days in her own life, which for her means days when she is ignored.
"When I go out to dinner with my friends and no one stares at me or asks to be moved to a table further away from me, that's a good day," she says.
In spite of it all, Loker is quick to point out her many blessings: Being able to share a home with her family, having a job she loves, having good friends and a good health care system to help with the cost of a lifetime of surgeries.
Her only regret?
"I have so much love to give and I would love to share that with a family of my own. I understand it will probably never happen, and I'm learning to accept it. But I am sad about it," she says. "It feels like the one great loss in my life."
Penny Loker will be on the CNN Facebook page for a live discussion Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET.

Spying issue won't go away
By Van Jones, Special to CNN
updated 1:48 PM EDT, Thu June 27, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Van Jones: Spying programs are symptoms of broader, long-lasting changes
Jones: This is not "another Obama scandal;" all government branches and parties involved
Jones: Finding a balance between civil liberties and national security is the challenge
It will cause unusual political coalitions and be a new defining debate, he says
Editor's note: Van Jones, a CNN contributor, is president and founder of Rebuild the Dream, an online platform focusing on policy, economics and media. He was President Barack Obama's green jobs adviser in 2009. He is also founder of Green for All, a national organization working to build a green economy. Follow him on Twitter: @VanJones68.
(CNN) -- Recent revelations about the extent of government phone and Internet surveillance are already shaking up the national debate.
But these programs are just symptoms of broader changes that will be shaking up our government and society for many decades to come.
Let's not cheapen or simplify the debate by trying to ram these revelations into the GOP-friendly framework of "another Obama scandal."
We should be honest and admit that something much bigger than that is going on here. The implication of the issue for our politics will be felt long after today's round of political "gotcha" and "pin the tail on the donkey" has faded away.
Van Jones
The FBI and National Security Agency have been mining Internet servers, searching for e-mails, videos and other documents under a program code-named PRISM for six years.
First, let me be clear: I am an opponent of PRISM. As a matter of first principles, I oppose overreaching, unaccountable spy programs.
That's why I supported neither the so-called Patriot Act, nor the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, when those measures were first considered by Congress.
U.S. Government spying on Americans
Nor was I supportive when President George W. Bush aggressively deployed his new powers.
Nor was I supportive when evidence began to emerge that the government was interpreting overly broad laws in an overly broad manner.
And I am not supportive now. Even as a former Obama administration official, I am always willing, when necessary, to constructively criticize the White House on matters of national importance.
But I oppose those who would try to pretend that this is somehow "another Obama scandal." It is not. What is happening is broader than that: All three branches of government and both political parties are implicated.
Congress passed the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and both the Obama and Bush administrations have implemented these programs. This is not a partisan issue.
In fact, it is much larger than any political scandal du jour. We are seeing the collision of two new forces in our society with something old, but precious.
New: The ability of terrorists, including lone wolves, to strike us at any time, including with weapons of massive destruction.
New: Information technology that gives the government extraordinary spying abilities, far beyond what was technically feasible even a decade ago.
Old: Our Constitution, written centuries before programs like PRISM could even be imagined, yet a rightly revered document that should guide us still today.
How we balance these three factors is one of the great challenges for this generation of Americans. Indeed, the collision is actually turning our political parties inside out.
There are "state powers versus civil liberties" fights happening within both parties. Presidents Obama and Bush line up on one side, together. On the other side are such strange bedfellows as Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon; Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; and Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon.
The issues are so deep, profound and even existential that neither party has a stable, predictable, internal consensus.
Translation: Arguments will be heated over this balance in both parties' presidential debates.
In the Democratic primary and during the 2016 convention, champions of civil liberties will certainly challenge Obama pragmatists over government spying. This will be especially true if Vice President Joe Biden and/or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seek the presidency.
Meanwhile, inside the GOP, right-wing libertarians will challenge security hawks over the same issue.
It is uncertain which side in which party will win this debate. But for once, at least, we are about to enter territory that cannot easily be viewed through the lens of "party versus party."
The battle to define the proper balance between civil liberties and national security is more likely to emerge as a case of "principle versus principle," fought out inside each party.
The resulting dynamic could create very interesting political coalitions in 2016 and even a new "issue map" for American politics -- completely redrawn by one of the defining debates of our time.

Mission impossible? Securing Syria's chemical weapons wouldn't be easy
By Tim LIster, CNN
updated 1:03 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Securing Syrian chemical weapons would be long, difficult process complicated by war
Experience in Iraq in the 1990s provides some clues to the possible obstacles in Syria
Issues include separating research from weaponry; deciding inspectors' oversight (CNN) -- Throughout much of the 1990s, U.N. weapons inspectors criss-crossed Iraq in search of Saddam Hussein's stocks of chemical weapons. It was a game of cat and mouse, as inspectors tried to reconcile what the Iraqi regime was telling them with conflicting intelligence from western governments.
In total, the inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission supervised the destruction of more than 40,000 chemical munitions, some 500,000 liters of chemical agents, 1.8 million liters of chemical precursors and delivery systems including ballistic missile warheads.

That experience may provide a glimpse of the obstacles to securing and removing or destroying Syria's massive stocks of the precursors that make chemical weapons. According to a new study by the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel, "Syria has accumulated since the 1980s a stockpile of approximately 1,000 tons of chemical weapons, stored in some 50 different sites."
TRANSCRIPT: Obama speech
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday he was working on a concrete plan for removing Syria's chemical weapons. Last year the U.S. Defense Department estimated that it might take as many as 70,000 troops to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That admittedly involved intervening in a conflict -- as opposed to having permission to access sites -- but it provides an indication of the scale of the task.
Report: Syria ready to disclose weapons
Finding Syria's chemical weapons
Destroying Syria's chemical weapons Obama: We will rally support from world Part of the problem is that Syria does not have one or even several facilities where its chemical agents are held. It has dozens.
"Syria's overall chemical weapons program is large, complex and geographically dispersed, with sites for storage, production, and preparation," James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, wrote in March this year.
READ MORE: Syria: Key developments
The new IICT study echoes others that conclude there are five major production and research sites, mainly in the north, and the main research center is in Damascus. CNN correspondent Arwa Damon got close to the largest site -- at As-Safira near Aleppo -- last year. While rebels controlled the hinterland around it, the facility itself was well-protected. Syria's battle lines have shifted since then, and the country more resembles a patchwork of fiefdoms, complicating the task of making safe the chemical agents.
Among the many issues that need to be resolved if Syria's chemical weapons are to be eliminated:
Would the inspectors work under the auspices of the U.N.? How many would be needed?
U.N. cover seems to be essential as the only form of inspection acceptable to all sides. Syria and Russia would not accept western inspectors unless they were under a U.N. umbrella. The United States would never accept Russian control of the operation.
The U.N. also has a wealth of experience in deploying inspectors and testing their findings, largely thanks to the exhaustive operations of UNSCOM in Iraq. Both U.S. and Russian inspectors belonged to UNSCOM teams.
Experts say removing Syria's chemical agents will need a detailed and ambitious plan, requiring hundreds of inspectors and technicians. (By the time UNSCOM's work ended in Iraq with the inspectors' expulsion, more than 1,000 individuals from more than 40 countries had served on inspection teams.)
How will U.N. find Syria's weapons?
Would weapons deal help Syrian people?
Report: Syria ready to disclose weapons
Kerry: Syria deal must be real, swift
France has suggested that the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Hague, should play an important role in Syria. In a statement Tuesday, the organization's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, noted that the Chemical Weapons Convention is "based on zero tolerance for chemical weapons."
"The OPCW ... stands ready to support international efforts that would strengthen it," he added. But its modus operandi is rather different from that of UNSCOM. A spokesman told CNN Tuesday that the organization does not go on "fishing expeditions" for material. Instead it expects a state to issue "a declaration that details all of the elements of their arsenal and their locations," which is then verified with on-site inspections.
The OPCW is not part of the United Nations but works with it closely under a 2001 agreement. It has already gained experience in Syria. The U.N. team that investigated the most recent chemical attack outside Damascus included nine OPCW experts and three from the World Health Organization. But the OPCW is already engaged in clearing up some of the Gadhafi regime's leftover chemical agents and still has several tons of mustard gas precursors to destroy in Libya.
Qualified chemical weapons inspectors and technicians are not a dime a dozen.

What sort of U.N. Security Council Resolution is needed to give the inspections real force?
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Tuesday that any U.N. Security Council resolution would have to threaten "extremely serious" consequences if Syria violated its conditions. Fabius said a Chapter VII Resolution -- which permits both military and non-military means to restore peace -- would be required. For his part, U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday that the United States would be asking: "Can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious?"
For western governments, the risk is that the wording of any U.N. resolution would provide the Syrians with wiggle room to prevaricate or obstruct. For example, different interpretations of the meaning of a Security Council resolution soured Russia's relations with the West after the Libyan conflict broke out. Moscow agreed to a resolution permitting intervention on humanitarian grounds (to save Benghazi from a bloodbath), only to complain later that it had been twisted to bring about regime change. This time it is the United States, France and Britain that will be studying the language closely.
The French have drafted a resolution, but many revisions and much wrangling are likely before it goes to a vote. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has already laid down one marker. "All of this will only mean anything if the United States and other nations supporting it tell us that they're giving up their plan to use force against Syria," he said in an interview Tuesday.
In a Google + Hangout event Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made it clear Washington believes the Assad regime controls access to sites where chemical weapons are held, "and so we believe they need to show us a completely verifiable, completely accountable, and ongoing verifiable process by which we know we have all of the weapons, access to all sites in question, unlimited access investigation."
But much of the chemical arsenal in Syria appears to be stored and developed at "dual-use" facilities, which the regime will want to protect from prying eyes. For example, the Centre d'Etude et Recherche Scientifique in Damascus develops chemical and biological agents, according to western experts. But it is also thought to be at the heart of other military and scientific research. In a report earlier this year, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a non-proliferation group, described the CERS as "the best-equipped research center in Syria, possessing better technical capacity and equipment than the four Syrian universities."
Similarly, a site at Jamraya north of Damascus is thought to contain both chemical weapons and other programs.
How much of complex sites like these would be open to unfettered access?
Chemical weapons are often known as the "poor man's nuclear weapon" because they are relatively cheap to produce. This poses another problem. Fertilizer plants and oil refineries have been identified in academic studies as being linked to Assad's chemical weapons program. They also will need to be inspected.
How can the inspectors' movement be assured in the midst of a civil war?
For seven years the weapons inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission trawled through Iraq looking for chemical weapons at some 120 facilities. They had sweeping powers including "unrestricted freedom of movement without advance notice in Iraq;" the "right to unimpeded access to any site or facility for the purpose of the on-site inspection;" and the "right to request, receive, examine, and copy any record data, or information...relevant to" its work.
UNSCOM was dealing with a recalcitrant and obstructive regime that did its best to mislead the U.N., but at least they were not trying to work during a war.
In Syria, how difficult would it be for inspectors to cross from government to rebel-held areas? How difficult would it be for them to make "surprise" inspections to make sure chemical weapons were not being moved or hidden? It took months for terms to be reached before the most recent U.N. inspection team was admitted to Syria, and it was at first permitted access to just three sites (before the August 21 attack, after which the inspectors were allowed into the Damascus suburb where the incident took place.)
How current is intelligence about the nature and location of Syria's chemical weapons stocks?
Several of the sites where supplies for chemical weapons were allegedly held have been surrounded or seized by rebels. Had those supplies been removed to safer places? And how do inspectors get in to check? Is there one team working in rebel-held areas and another in parts held by the regime?
Are chemical weapons still stored mainly as precursors? Or has part of Syria's arsenal already been deployed (if not used) in short-range missiles or artillery shells? There have been some indications, according to U.S. sources, that the regime has consolidated its chemical weapons stockpile in fewer places to better safeguard it. Senior U.S. military officials have been saying since early this year that the Syrian government has been moving its stocks of sarin and mustard gas.
It is very difficult for outsiders, even Israel and the United States, to be sure of what the Syrian regime is doing and what its intentions are. Intercepts and satellite imagery offer clues, and Israel has already carried out bombing raids against convoys said to be carrying weapons to the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, an ally of the Assad regime. But U.S. officials acknowledge that it's hard to keep track of the hundreds of military sites in Syria
Hezbollah units are now established inside Syria and were involved in the summer battle for control of the town of Qusayr. So it's more than tracking the movement of trucks from known Syrian military facilities to areas along the Syrian-Lebanese border where Hezbollah is well-established.
But one Israeli specialist in chemical weapons says moving weaponized chemical agents around is far from easy.
"There are many ways to know it with monitoring," according to Ely Karmon, a senior research scholar at the IICT. He told CNN they are "difficult to transport, you need specialists to ensure they don't leak or explode along the way. And Hezbollah has no knowledge (of chemical weapons) so should they perhaps involve the Iranians or Syrian technicians?"
How can such a huge amount of material be safely moved out of a war zone?
Transporting hundreds of tons of chemicals through a country ravaged by war, where the rebels are a patchwork of militias and major routes are not under the government's control, is a huge logistical challenge. Convoys would need to be guarded, airports secured and/or border crossings secured. But who does the guarding? Syrian troops? Unlikely unless supervised by an international. U.S. troops? No one is floating that idea.
Alternatively, sites within Syria where chemical weapons precursors could be safely destroyed would have to be identified and guarded. This appears to be the preferred option of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon.
"I am considering urging the Security Council to demand the immediate transfer of Syria's chemical weapons and chemical precursor stocks to places inside Syria where they can be safely stored and destroyed," he told reporters in New York Monday.
While chemical weapons stocks are relatively secure within army bases and research facilities, there is a greater risk once they are moved that they might fall into the wrong hands -- such as the jihadist groups active among Syria's rebels. However, Syria's chemical weapons are binary weapons, meaning that they are stored as separate ingredients that would have to be combined before becoming lethal. Using them would not be easy for militia groups.
What sort of time limit is feasible for such an operation, and who decides whether the Syrian regime is cooperating fully?
These are huge unanswered questions. The UNSCOM inspectors had to challenge Iraqi officials repeatedly with detailed documentary evidence that not all Iraq's chemical weapons had been declared. There were countless reports to the U.N. Security Council and 12 UNSC resolutions between 1991 and 1996 in support of its work.
Karmon estimates that the whole process in Syria could take three to four years and argues it would be impossible without a cease-fire, with the two sides retreating to allow inspectors to do their work. Given the stakes on the battlefield that Syria has become, that seems unlikely.
What's to stop the Assad regime starting over, especially if it sees a tactical advantage in using such weapons?
In 1989, then-CIA Director William Webster said Syria had begun producing chemical agents in the early 1980s. So Syria has some 30 years of experience in making chemical weapons and has built a network of suppliers all over the world. Defecting military officers have said that Iranian experts have helped develop Syria develop its arsenal and the missiles to deliver chemical weapons (despite Iran itself being targeted by chemical weapons during its war with Iraq.)
Starting a new chemical weapons program would not be technically difficult and could be done discreetly if on a limited scale. It might also be tempting for a regime whose conventional military strength is being eroded. Military analysts point out that Syria began developing chemical weapons capability decades ago to counter Israel's conventional military superiority. That superiority is even greater today than it was, and the Assad regime may one day again see possession of chemical weapons as critical to its survival.

KLA goes from splinter group to potential giant-killer
March 24, 1999
Web posted at: 9:16 p.m. EST (0216 GMT)
(CNN) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army is an unlikely catalyst for NATO's first attack on a sovereign nation in its 50-year history.
Just a year ago, the KLA was a tiny, militant splinter group that wanted Kosovo's independence from Serbia, at a time when most of the province's residents had more modest political ambitions.
Of Kosovo's 2.1 million people, 90 percent are ethnic Albanians who complain Belgrade has shut their schools, suppressed their language and ignored their political rights. For years, ethnic Albanian politicians have demanded Belgrade
restore the autonomy that was stripped from them in 1991 by Slobodan Milosevic, president of the rump Yugoslav Republic made up of Serbia and Montenegro.

Due to its small size, modest equipment and lack of popular support, the KLA was never seen as a serious threat.
However, in 1997 it began killing Serb police and others who collaborated with the Serbs. It also drove Serbs entirely out of some areas.
In February 1998, the government struck back. Milosevic sent troops into the areas controlled by the KLA, destroying property and killing 80 Kosovars, including women,
children and elderly men. The killing provoked riots in Pristina, the Kosovar capital, and again raised
the specter of ethnic cleansing by the Serbs, like that in Bosnia's recent past.
By the first week of March, the Yugoslav and Serbian forces had wiped out what was believed to be the core of
the KLA, a single family in the village of Prekaz headed by rebel leader Adem Jashari.
But the crackdown backfired badly.
Within weeks, the KLA's ranks swelled with fighters, the government attacks escalated, and tens upon tens of thousands of Kosovars fled their homes.
While the Serb-led offensive drove the KLA out of virtually all its strongholds, it also encouraged a massive flow of weaponry from neighboring Albania in support of the rebels.
And it encouraged militants to attack Serb soldiers and civilians as a way of escalating the conflict and drawing in NATO to back them up.
In September, NATO issued an ultimatum to halt the fighting.
Belgrade appeared to back down, withdrawing some of its troops.
Richard Holbrooke eased the situation, and thousands of Kosovars returned to their burned and battered villages.
When the KLA fighters returned under cover of the cease-
fire, the guerrilla group had changed. Many analysts saw it as better organized and certainly better armed than ever before.
It had also changed its tactics to reflect its strengths and exploit its enemies' weaknesses.
In January, the KLA took eight government soldiers hostage, triggering new violence.
Within days, the killing of 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak, condemned as a "massacre" by international observers on the scene, galvanized Western opinion. A consensus grew in NATO that the two sides would
be forced into a peace agreement, either by moral suasion or military force.
When the KLA signed onto the peace accord that NATO had written -- and which contained provisions that Milosevic had rejected out of hand -- they won their battle for de facto NATO support.
Milosevic declared he would rather be bombed than give up Kosovo and allow NATO troops to deploy there.
