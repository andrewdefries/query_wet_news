Commentary: Why we should worry about SotomayorStory HighlightsAbigail Thernstrom: Sonia Sotomayor's life story is a compelling oneShe says Democrats haven't honored such humble beginnings in GOP nomineesShe says Sotomayor's "empathy" may be code word for one brand of politicsThernstrom: I'm concerned that judge may have more fidelity to activism than to lawNext Article in Politics » By Abigail Thernstrom Special to CNN Editor's note: Abigail Thernstrom is the author of "Voting Rights -- and Wrongs: The Elusive Quest for Racially Fair Elections," published last month by AEI Press. She is the vice-chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Her writing can be found at http://www.thernstrom.com/. Abigail Thernstrom says an impressive biography isn't a qualification for the Supreme Court. (CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor is all but certain to be confirmed as an associate justice on the Supreme Court. It is close to unimaginable that the Republicans will peel off enough Democratic votes to stop Senate confirmation. She's a first: a Latina. And she has an impressive life history: Raised in a housing project by a single mother, she went to Princeton and then to Yale Law School. It's a classic American overcoming-the-odds story, but, while admirable, it is not a qualification for the highest court in the land. Democrats themselves have often implicitly made the same point -- about other minority appointees, in fact. They never saw the much humbler origins of Justice Clarence Thomas as an argument for his elevation to the Court. And they used a filibuster to stop Bush appointee Miguel Estrada from getting a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which they feared would be a springboard to the Supreme Court. Estrada is a Honduran who arrived in America at age 17 with only limited command of English; he was also raised by a single mother and made it to Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the law review. Supporters of Sotomayor argue that she will add needed "diversity" to the Court. Yet, with her confirmation, there will be six Catholics, two Jews and one Protestant. For many Americans, religious affiliation is more important in defining an individual than race or ethnicity. But no one is complaining about "too many" Catholics or Jews -- thankfully. America is supposed to be a land in which individuals are seen as ... individuals. Too many, too few: that is the language of un-American quotas. Sotomayor has suggested that race and ethnicity, to a substantial degree, define individuals. "Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging," she said in a 2001 speech. At her confirmation hearings, she will undoubtedly dance away from such ethnic determinism. But it would appear to be what she believes, since she has reiterated the point several times in different venues. Don't Miss In Depth: Sotomayor nomination

In Depth: Commentaries
Her supporters also emphasize the "empathy" she would bring to the court. It is a quality the president promised he would look for in making court appointments. In a July 2007 campaign speech, he said, "We need somebody who's got the heart -- the empathy -- to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old, and that's the criteria by which I'll be selecting my judges." Evidently, however, not all impoverished backgrounds leave you empathetic. The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding appears to be party membership. By definition, conservatives are assumed to lack empathy. As Berkeley professor George Lakoff has argued, "Empathy is at the heart of progressive thought. ... Progressives care about others as well as themselves." And, by implication, conservatives don't. Empathy has thus become a code word for progressive politics -- the likelihood that, as a justice, the nominee will take politically liberal positions. Public policy preferences driving Supreme Court decisions? What a shock. Some justices have much more respect for the law than others, but if the opinions were not often judgments driven by political values as well, they would be less predictable. Most court-watchers thought (correctly, as it turned out) that the recent New Haven firefighters' case would come down four-four, with only Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote hard to call. The results of an exam for promotion within the New Haven fire department had been thrown out because, with one exception, all of the successful candidates were white -- the "wrong" color, according to the reasoning of the city and Sotomayor. One can argue that race discrimination decisions do not involve ideology and are based on strictly legal grounds, but if so, it is passing strange that in busing, affirmative action and other race-related cases, even before the oral argument is heard we almost always know which justices will take what positions. Liberals still support busing, for instance; conservatives oppose it. Sotomayor will replace another reliable liberal, Justice David Souter, and so the ideological balance on the court will not change. And yet, perhaps as a consequence of her implicit embrace of quotas and identity politics, she has come to the Senate hearings with public support that is unusually low; only 47 percent of Americans say they want her confirmed, a recent CNN poll found. Nevertheless, Republicans are likely to tread softly in the hearings. Race-related issues make them nervous, and Latinos are a fast-growing group with increasing political clout, especially in such swing states as Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Virginia. Barring the totally unexpected, Sotomayor's confirmation will thus be a cakewalk. Let us hope that the public's pessimism proves to be misguided and she turns out to be a lawyer's lawyer and not an ethnic activist who tends to let the usual political definition of "empathy" drive her opinions. There is reason to worry: She will have lifetime tenure on an institution with enormous power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Abigail Thernstrom.

Commentary: Let's take 'all children forward'Story Highlights Arne Duncan: Agenda calls for raising standards and improving teacher quality Duncan: Obama urges stakeholders to set aside ideologies, do what's right for kids "We cannot rely on 19th century traditions in a 21st century world," says DuncanNext Article in U.S. » ReadEXPLAINER By Arne Duncan Special to CNN Editor's note: Arne Duncan is U.S. Secretary of Education. "We have many pockets of excellence. The challenge is moving to systems of excellence," says Arne Duncan. (CNN) -- In our first 100 days, the Obama administration has presented a comprehensive education agenda -- from the cradle through college -- that protects children and jobs in the short term and invests in the long term by advancing education reform. We are using the power of transparency to expose the good, the bad and the ugly about American education as a first step toward raising standards, improving teacher quality and turning around low-performing schools. To push our reform agenda, the president has challenged states, districts, unions and other stakeholders to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to improvement, set aside ideologies and do what's right for children. That means eliminating caps on creating charter schools, paying more to teachers in high-need subjects and hard-to-staff schools, and implementing performance pay. He has challenged parents to take more responsibility for the education of their children by turning off the TV, helping with homework and reading with their children every night.

While recent national testing results confirm that we have a long way to go before every child will have the education he or she needs to compete in the global economy, there is much cause for hope. Today, innovative schools are posting achievement gains, districts are experimenting with compensation systems that encourage effective teaching and dozens of states are working toward higher academic standards. The teaching profession is attracting more high-quality applicants than ever. New learning models are emerging in communities all across America. We have many pockets of excellence. The challenge is moving to systems of excellence. I am especially grateful that the president and vice president -- amid fighting two wars and trying to fix the worst economy since the Great Depression -- are focusing so much time, energy and resources on education. Congress also deserves credit for investing $100 billion in our schools through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Already, $44 billion is available to states and districts -- money that will keep teachers teaching and keep kids learning -- while laying the groundwork for a generation of education reform. If governors, mayors and superintendents embrace the law's core reforms, they could qualify for a portion of the $5 billion "Race to the Top" and "Invest in What Works and Innovation" funds. These discretionary funds are a carrot for educators who will break the mold, scale up successful programs and transform whole school systems. Don't Miss In Depth: What If?
Duncan details education stimulus
Commentary: Throwing billions at schools won't fix them
In Depth: Commentaries
The president also set a long-term goal of producing a higher percentage of college graduates than any other country by 2020. To meet this goal, the Recovery Act provides $31 billion in Pell Grants and tuition tax credits. In addition, the administration has proposed shifting to direct lending instead of subsidized private loans to free at least $50 billion over the next decade and help more young people and adults go to college. We are very hopeful that Congress and the lending industry will support this common-sense reform. We have a historic opportunity to drive change and lift education to a new level. For the first time in decades, we have the funding to achieve our goals and committed leadership in Washington and in the broader education community. The question is whether we have the courage to face the truths about our current state of education and to pursue fundamental change. We cannot be satisfied with a nation where one in four high-school students fails to graduate and half of four-year college students do not finish on time. We cannot be satisfied with a 180-day school year -- up to 40 days shorter than that of other advanced countries. We cannot rely on 19th century traditions in a 21st century world. I have spread our message of reform online, on air, in print and on the road -- in nearly 70 interviews and media events. I have met with 300 individuals from education, philanthropic and business groups and I have traveled to almost two dozen cities and states. In Minnesota, I joined Vice President Joe Biden to share how the Recovery Act will help the middle class and support education. In Miami, Florida, I spoke to students with the vice president's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, about boosting college access and affordability. In New Orleans, Louisiana, I encouraged leaders to disseminate the city's promising school turnaround practices. To build on the successes of the last 100 days, we will take the next 100 days to conduct a national "Listening and Learning" tour in states across America. We want to hear directly from educators, parents, students and administrators about what is working and what needs to be improved, especially with regard to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as "No Child Left Behind." By working together and staying focused on children, we can create an education system that instead of leaving too many children behind, takes all children forward. Let's get to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arne Duncan.

State-by-state developments related to Hurricane Irene By the CNN Wire Staff (CNN) -- On Friday, President Barack Obama said of Hurricane Irene that "all indications point to this being a historic hurricane." Numerous local, state and federal agencies, among other organizations, have taken steps in preparation. Here are some of those measures, for states most affected by Hurricane Irene:SOUTH CAROLINA Irene was off the South Carolina coast on Friday, with its outer bands bringing gusty winds, heavy rain and dangerous surf. No evacuations were ordered, as the storm path appears to be too far east to present serious problems. However, state emergency officials were monitoring Irene and have contingency plans. The state emergency management agency is using its website, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to keep the public informed.NORTH CAROLINA Hurricane Irene is expected to make its first contact with the U.S. mainland on Saturday morning near Beaufort, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. An ocean surge of up to 11 feet is possible in coastal North Carolina, tearing away beaches and probably damaging homes, businesses and other structures before sliding up the East Coast to New England, said National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read. Ernie Seneca, a North Carolina government spokesman, told CNN Friday afternoon that authorities were concerned about the "entire eastern half of the state. This hurricane could potentially impact an area that includes 20 counties and 3.5 million people." Some 32 counties have declared a local state of emergency, while shelters are open or ready-to-open in 26 counties, said Julia Jarema, a spokeswoman with North Carolina's emergency management division. Gov. Bev Perdue has declared a state of emergency for counties east of Interstate 95. On Friday evening, the governor said evacuations were under way in 18 counties. Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 cargo planes are ready to respond after the storm passes, Perdue added. So, too, are 280 National Guard troops on the ground in eastern North Carolina. Ferries have been shut down in North Carolina, with crews lashing down vessels so that they can ride out the storm. Perdue was one of seven governors on a conference call with President Obama on Friday morning, talking about the storm. Pamlico County Sheriff Bill Sawyer Jr. told CNN he talked with many fishermen and others who have been pulling their boats from the water and taking other precautions, adding "when they're concerned, it's something really to be concerned about." Still, he expressed confidence that residents will make it through the storm, saying, "I think people know what they're doing." A mandatory evacuation order was in effect for residents and visitors in Hyde County, North Carolina, which includes Ocracoke Island, reachable only by boat or private plane, on the Outer Banks. Nearby Dare County, which includes Manteo, Nags Head, Duck and historic Kitty Hawk, issued a mandatory evacuation order for tourists and residents. In a release early Friday evening, the county's emergency management agency warned that "those who do not evacuate should expect consequences," adding that emergency personnel will not be available. There are no shelters in the county, though there are two in Roanoke Rapids and Jackson, North Carolina. Carteret County also issued a mandatory evacuation order for visitors in part of the county. On Friday, there will be a mandatory evacuation for all residents of Bogue Banks, said county spokesman Rodney Cates. Currituck County said all residents must leave by 8 a.m. Friday. State and county emergency management agencies coordinated with the American Red Cross to open shelters for residents leaving the Outer Banks. Shelters were open in Nash and Wilson counties for visitors and residents from Hyde County. Other shelters were on standby in Halifax, Northampton and Onslow counties for other evacuees from the Outer Banks. North Carolina Emergency Management officials were posting updates on Twitter, Facebook and on the Crime Control and Public Safety website. Fort Bragg is one of several military sites that have been called to coordinate action with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond in the aftermath of the hurricane, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced Friday in a message to Defense Department personnel. VIRGINIA Gov. Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency in Virginia on Thursday morning. Among other measures, the declaration allows the 300 Virginia National Guard troops thus far deployed to the region to position resources at key locations in advance of severe weather hitting the commonwealth. The governor told CNN on Friday night that he flew over coastal areas earlier in the day and saw the roads heading inland were "full of traffic, but moving." "I think they're heeding the warning," he said. McDonnell warned of significant flooding, trees down, widespread power outages and possible water shortages if the storm debilitates water treatment plants. Storm surges of 4 feet to 8 feet are possible in the Virginia Tidewater region, said the National Hurricane Center. McDonnell was on a Friday morning conference call with the president and six other governors regarding the storm. Norfolk Mayor Paul Fraim and Virginia Beach Mayor Will Sessoms were also on the call. The Hampton Roads region of Virginia is at greatest risk from Irene, the state's Department of Emergency Management says. Winds could reach 95 mph in that area, and flooding is possible throughout the eastern end of the state, the agency said. A declaration of emergency was declared Thursday afternoon in the coastal city of Norfolk. The city issued a mandatory evacuation order -- effective at 8 a.m. Saturday -- for residents in low-lying areas. A shelter will open at Granby High School at 6 p.m. Friday. Some 38 U.S. Navy ships -- including 27 that were based out of Norfolk -- are out at sea, in order to minimize the impact from Hurricane Irene. This represents 13% of the U.S. Navy's deployable battle force ships. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Mayor Vincent Gray was among several mayors, as well as seven governors, on a conference call with Obama on Friday morning, talking about the storm. In addition, the mayor said he's been in touch with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and gotten the full support of FEMA. Washington could face hurricane conditions for roughly 24 hours, likely ending Sunday afternoon, the mayor said. He said 2 to 4 inches of rain could fall in the city, likely causing some flooding. Gray declared a state of emergency for Washington late Friday afternoon as Hurricane Irene neared. The declaration opens up additional resources to deal with a storm that Gray said would "bring heavy rain, flash floods and high winds to the area." On his Twitter feed, Gray alerted residents about emergency routes out of the city as well as Washington's hurricane preparations guide. He also informed people about the availability of sandbags for those wishing to stem flooding. "A lot of stores are out already" of bottled water, said George Hawkins, general manager of the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. He urged people to fill bottles with tap water. The National Park Service is working to protect the Washington Monument from further damage, just days after it was cracked by a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, agency spokeswoman Carol Johnson said Friday. Engineers, some of them suspended on ropes, are working inside the monument to "plug holes and catch anything that they can't plug," she added. There are no plans to monitor the edifice during the storm. It will be evaluated after. Sunday's planned dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial in Washington has been postponed to an undetermined date, said Harry Johnson, Sr., head of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Foundation. The last of the weekend's events was to be a national prayer service on Saturday, with a gala ball also canceled. MARYLAND Gov. Martin O'Malley declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon in advance of the storm. Residents of low-lying areas in the state were being asked to evacuate ahead of what the governor called "a very dangerous and potentially deadly hurricane." The governor said Friday that "anybody that thinks that this is a normal hurricane and that they can just stick it out is being both selfish, stupid and also diverting essential public safety assets away from the task at hand, which is safeguarding lives and getting people out of the way." O'Malley was also on a conference call about the hurricane early Friday, along with other state and local officials and the president. Everyone in Ocean City was supposed to evacuate the area by 5 p.m. Friday, the city's emergency management office said in a news release. After that, only emergency personnel are to be allowed into the city. Public transportation in the city is to halt at the same hour. People are also being urged to move their vehicles to higher ground, so they won't be swept away by fast-moving waters. Ocean City's wastewater treatment plant will be taken offline at 6 p.m. Saturday. The system is expected to go back online late Sunday. A state of emergency has been declared in the state capital, Annapolis, where additional police officers will be deployed to assist the public during and after the storm, Mayor Joshua Cohen said Friday. The city will ration remaining sandbags, and residents can park for free in four city garages. The Maryland Emergency Management Agency was providing links to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency's website has a link to an interactive map to help residents identify flood-prone areas. The Silopanna Music Festival scheduled for Saturday at the Anne Arundel County Fairgrounds in Maryland was canceled. The office of Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that sandbags would be available to residents as well as business owners at four locations. In addition, the city's Emergency Operation Center will open at 7 a.m. Friday to plan for the maintenance of essential services during the storm. DELAWARE Gov. Jack Markell declared a state of emergency at 6 p.m. Thursday. The announcement included a "mandatory evacuation of visitors" in coastal areas, adding it is "highly likely" that there eventually will be mandatory evacuations for residents of some areas. In a statement, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency urged those who had planned to visit the state this weekend to "postpone plans immediately." The governor said more than a foot of rain could fall in some locations along with the coast, with 9 to 10 inches possible in inland parts of Sussex, Kent and New Castle counties. Thirteen Air Force and Army aircraft are being evacuated from Delaware to avoid damage, according to the National Guard. But there were no plans to evacuate people from military bases. Army Maj. Gen. Francis Vavala, adjutant general of the Delaware National Guard, said 200 Guard members could respond within hours if requested by the governor and 500 more could be ready within 48 hours. Markell was one of the seven governors on a conference call with Obama on Friday morning, talking about the storm. "Have a plan, get a kit and stay informed," Delaware Emergency Management Agency Director Jamie Turner said. "We want everyone to have food and water for at least three days, batteries for lights and radios and a means of charging cell phones. "Remember that part of your emergency plan is to have a destination in mind if you have to evacuate. If officials instruct you to evacuate, please do it." PENNSYLVANIA Rainfall from Irene -- expected to be as much as 7 inches in the Philadelphia area -- could cause the Schuylkill River and other bodies of water to flood. Tidal flooding along the Delaware River is also possible. Gov. Tom Corbett declared a state of emergency on Friday. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority will halt service from about midnight Saturday to until after Irene has passed, which is expected to happen about mid-day Sunday. Service will resume "on a route by route basis," the transportation agency said. "It is strongly recommended that Philadelphians living in flood-prone areas make alternative arrangements to stay with family or friends whose homes are not prone to flooding for the course of this event and until the flooding threat subsides," Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter's office said. On Friday, Nutter said Philadelphia was on hurricane warning status in anticipation of expected localized flooding and power outages that could last hours or days. No evacuation order is being issued for the city, though Nutter urged residents to use common sense and leave if necessary. Three shelters -- with a capacity of 1,500 and capable of expanding to 6,000 -- will open in Philadelphia starting at 6 p.m. Saturday. All parks and recreation centers will close at the same time. The Philadelphia Phillies' scheduled game on Sunday against the Florida Marlins now will be played as part of a day/night doubleheader at 1:05 p.m. Saturday.NEW JERSEY Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency and urged people to leave New Jersey shore points before the hurricane arrives. If the hurricane continues on its current track, then "from a flooding perspective, this could be a 100-year event," Christie said. Three-to-six foot storm surges could occur on the New Jersey shore, said National Hurricane Center director Read. The governor ordered the opening of the Ramapo River floodgates, in hopes of lessening the potential flooding from the storm. The plan is to open the floodgates about 1.5 feet, so that Pompton Lake will drop 3 feet below the spillway by Friday evening. Starting at 8 a.m. Friday, tolls were suspended temporarily on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and the Atlantic City Expressway. New Jersey Transit also will suspend service at noon Saturday. The southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway closed past exit 98 at 8 p.m. Friday. There will be no eastbound traffic on routes 47 and 347 in Cape May County, with all those lanes instead being used for westward-bound traffic starting at 6 p.m. Friday. The state's emergency preparedness website warned of the danger of a hurricane storm surge: "The storm surge is a dome of ocean water the hurricane pushes ahead of itself. At its peak a storm surge can be 25 feet high and 50-100 miles wide. The storm surge can devastate coastal communities as it sweeps ashore." Atlantic City and the surrounding barrier islands will have a mandatory evacuation in place at 6 a.m. Friday, according to Linda Gilmore, Atlantic County's public information officer. The evacuation will extend from Seaville to as far north as Galloway Township, and include only areas east of Route 9. Mandatory evacuations are in effect for all residents of Bay Head and Mantoloking and many residents in Point Pleasant Beach, according to the latter borough's website. Shelters are set up at Toms River North High School and Wall Township High School, with the Point Pleasant Beach High School serving as a staging area to shuttle people to safer locales between 7 to 11 a.m. Saturday. The start of the NFL preseason game between the New York Giants and New York Jets, set for the stadium the teams share in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has been pushed up to a 2 p.m. Saturday start-time, the teams' announced on their websites. The game had been scheduled to start at 7 p.m. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is one of three military sites that will be used as bases for coordinated action with FEMA to respond to the aftermaths of the hurricane, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced Friday in a message to Defense Department personnel.NEW YORK A hurricane warning was issued late Friday afternoon for an area that includes New York City and Long Island, among other northeastern locales. About the same time, Obama declared a state of emergency for New York state due to the storm. Irene's current track could make it the most destructive hurricane to strike New York City since 1938. "The sun is shining, but don't be misled," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Friday afternoon. "There is a very dangerous storm heading in our direction. There is no question that we are going to be with wind and high water that is very dangerous." New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has ordered the National Guard to deploy up to 900 soldiers. The Metropolitan Transit Authority will institute a systemwide shutdown when trains and buses begin their final runs at noon Saturday; the shutdown will include subways, buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and Access-A-Ride. If winds exceed 60 mph, the George Washington Bridge, Tappan Zee Bridge, Triborough Bridge, Queensborough Bridge and possibly others will be ordered closed. The same goes for these bridges over the Hudson River: the Bear Mountain Bridge, Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, Mid-Hudson Bridge in Poughkeepsie, Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge and Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the Catskills. To speed the evacuation process, Cuomo announced that tolls will not need to be paid at numerous bridges, including the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge and Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. In addition, people riding buses throughout New York City do not have pay fares. Subway and rail rides from stations in the mandatory evacuation area also are free. At 3 p.m. Friday, Suffolk County ordered mandatory evacuations of barrier beach communities, particularly those on the western end of Fire Island, county spokesman Mark Smith said. Further evacuations in low-lying, beachside communities -- including parts of the Hamptons and Montauk -- could be mandated Saturday morning, he added. A mandatory evacuation order also has been issued for some low-lying areas of all five boroughs of New York City, Bloomberg said Friday. The mandatory order includes Coney Island and Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn; Far Rockaway and Broad Channel in Queens; South Beach, Midland Beach and other low-lying areas on Staten Island; and Battery Park City in Manhattan. It is the first such order in the city's history, the mayor said. "If you live in Zone A or the Rockaways, you have to move," Bloomberg said. New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission announced Friday evening that, starting at 9 a.m. Saturday, it will dispatch more cabs than normal into low-lying areas where evacuations have been ordered. The drivers and riders will have a special "zone fare" system and other new rules, including mandating that pets be allowed on board and encouraging people to ride in groups. In addition, Bloomberg told reporters that 91 emergency facilities -- which, among other things, will serve as shelters -- are expected to open around New York City at 4 p.m. Friday. NYC.gov, the city's website, crashed intermittently due to excessive web traffic that Bloomberg said was roughly three times as much as normal. City crews were hurrying to clean out storm drains and catch basins to minimize street flooding, Bloomberg said at a news conference. Five city hospitals located in low-lying areas were being evacuated Friday afternoon, said Susan Craig, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. They include Coney Island Hospital, the New York University Hospitals Center, the Veterans Administration hospital in Manhattan, and the Staten Island University and the Staten Island University North facilities. In addition, eight nursing homes in Brooklyn and Queens, eight adult care facilities in those two boroughs as well as Staten Island, and the South Beach Psychiatric Center in Staten Island are being evacuated, according to Craig. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced Friday night that five airports it operates -- John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark Liberty, Teterboro and Stewart -- would be closed as of noon Saturday to all arriving international and domestic flights. Several airlines -- including Delta, Southwest, United and Continental -- have announced they'll suspend operations Sunday, and in some cases on Saturday as well, out of Kennedy, LaGuardia and other New York City metropolitan airports. Albany International Airport in New York is working to safeguard the terminal, airfield and aircraft, said John O'Donnell, the CEO of the Albany County Airport Authority. "Our goal is to ensure the safety of travelers, staff and equipment and be prepared to resume full operations by Monday morning," he said. Several schools in and around New York City, including Columbia University and New York University, have pushed back their students' move-in dates due to the hurricane. Cuomo on Thursday declared a state of emergency for Bronx, Kings, New York, Queen, Richmond, Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as contiguous areas that are potentially in the storm's path. He was one of seven governors on a conference call with President Obama on Friday morning, talking about the impending storm. All Broadway performances scheduled for Saturday and Sunday are being canceled because of the suspension of public transportation in New York as Hurricane Irene approaches, officials said. The NFL preseason game between the New York Jets and New York Giants -- once scheduled to start at 7 p.m. Saturday, then moved to a 2 p.m. Saturday start-time -- has been postponed. The game, instead, will be played Monday night, the teams announced on their website. CONNECTICUT A hurricane warning is in effect for southern Connecticut, along the Long Island Sound, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for the northern part of the state ahead of Hurricane Irene's expected arrival around 10 a.m. Sunday. In a news conference, Gov. Dannel Malloy urged "all Connecticut citizens and all public officials to take this event as seriously as any event that we have ever prepared for." The state's emergency operations center has been fully activated, and there have been regular meetings involving state and local officials. Nearly 33,000 sandbags had been distributed to state residents as of 11 a.m. Friday, the governor and emergency management and homeland security department said in a joint "situation report." The town of Old Saybrook has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the storm, according to the state. The governor declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon, saying "the forecast path of Hurricane Irene has convinced me that the signing of this declaration is necessary, and will help us react more quickly and effectively in the event of a serious weather event." The New Haven Open, the final WTA tune-up before next week's U.S. Open, moved its championship match at Yale to 1 p.m. from 5 p.m. Saturday to avoid the storm. First Selectman Michael Tetreau on Friday declared a state of emergency, effective immediately, in Fairfield. All town facilities -- including parks, playing fields, beaches and libraries -- will be closed starting at 8 a.m. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for some parts of the town beginning at noon Saturday, with a shelter opening then at Ludlow High School. MASSACHUSETTS Gov. Deval Patrick on Friday afternoon issued a state of emergency for the commonwealth. Hours earlier, he was one of seven governors on a conference call with President Obama about the hurricane. A hurricane warning was issued later Friday for the South Coast part of the state east to Sagamore Beach, on Cape Cod, as well as Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The MBTA, which runs Boston's subway service known as the "T" and other public transportation, said Friday that it was not planning on suspending service, as is being done in New York City and Philadelphia. The agency plans to have "extra personnel and equipment" on hand throughout the system in an "effort to prevent any disruptions in service," the MBTA announced on its website. "Work crews are ready to respond to any storm-related issues that may emerge." The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency website features numerous articles on hurricane preparation and safety, including how to keep pets safe. It gives instructions for following evacuation orders should that become necessary. There is also a Cape Cod emergency traffic plan. The Kenny Chesney concert at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro was moved from Sunday to Friday. The Boston Red Sox will no longer have a Sunday afternoon game with the Oakland Athletics, moving that contest to Saturday, the team announced in a press release. That game will start at 5 p.m. as part of a split doubleheader, following a first game set to begin at noon. Westover Air Reserve Base is one of several military sites that have been called to coordinate action with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond in the aftermath of the hurricane, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced Friday in a message to defense department personnel.RHODE ISLAND Coastal Rhode Island, including Block Island, are under a hurricane warning, which was issued late Friday afternoon. Gov. Lincoln Chaffee signed a disaster emergency declaration on Friday, after concluding "there is no doubt that Rhode Island will be hit with high winds, a storm surge and rain." The governor said he's been in close contact with mayors and town managers, and added that "individual preparation is essential." Emergency Management Agency officials, during a press conference on Thursday, urged residents to put together emergency kits to tide them over for up to three days. There were no immediate plans for evacuations. Lt. Col. Denis Riel, spokesman for the Rhode Island National Guard, said personal preparedness is important. "It's not a matter of if it hits us it's when," he said. Saturday's Newport Bucket Regatta, a yachting event in Rhode Island, has been canceled. A gala dinner was moved up to Friday. NEW HAMPSHIRE New Hampshire's population has surged since the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 killed 13 people and caused $22 million (in 1938 dollars) in damage, the state's readiness site says. "A repeat of this event today would be devastating," it says. "The state's population has more than doubled since 1938 and much of that population growth has been in areas near the coast or inland waterways. There are many more people in harm's way today." The New Hampshire Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the American Red Cross in New Hampshire have posted recommendations for hurricane preparations. Governor Lynch and state officials are also closely coordinating with local emergency officials to ensure the state's preparedness for the impending storm. The Governor has directed the state Emergency Operations Center to be opened. MAINE The Penobscot Narrows Bridge Observatory was closed at noon Friday, the Maine Department of Transportation announced. The observatory is expected to reopen at 9 a.m. Tuesday. Storm covers are being installed in hopes of preventing water from getting in during the storm. Lobstermen can now haul and move lobster traps anytime, after the state's Marine Resources department lifted existing restrictions on nights and weekends. The Maine Marine Patrol urged all people in boats to secure their vessels ahead of the coming storm. The state's emergency management agency offered information on its website informing people of what they can do to minimize damage and maximize safety as the hurricane approaches. Acting Insurance Superintendent Eric Cioppa has asked Maine residents to review their homeowner and renter insurance policies to determine if they will be covered in the event of massive flooding. "Be prepared, and 'stay tuned,'" Maine Emergency Management Agency Director Rob McAleer said on the agency website. "Irene could bring heavy rains, high winds, storm surge or any combination of those things. Pay close attention to weather forecasts, and start now to think about your personal emergency plans. You want to give yourself enough time to take care of your home, business or boat before the storm arrives."CNN's Larry Shaughnessy, Chris Lawrence, Susan Candiotti, Jim Kavanaugh, Dan Mercia and Sarah Hoye contributed to this report.

How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: A senior official says "Geronimo" was code for the capturing or killing of bin LadenNEW: The woman killed during the operation may not have been bin Laden's wifeAuthorities call the raid a surgical strikeSources say bin Laden resisted the assault and was shot in a firefight (CNN) -- In the dark of night, U.S. helicopters approached a high-walled compound in Pakistan on a mission to capture or kill one of the world's most notorious terrorist leaders. Less than 40 minutes later -- early Monday morning in Pakistan -- Osama bin Laden was dead, along with four others inside the complex, and the U.S. forces departed with the slain al Qaeda leader's body to fulfill a vow that originated shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. And as he announced the raid at the White House Sunday night, U.S. President Barack Obama called bin Laden's death "the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda." One senior administration official called the investigation a "team effort" and a "model of really seamless cooperation" across agencies. This official and others briefed reporters on further details about the assault on the compound, which they believe was built five years ago for the specific purpose of hiding bin Laden -- known by the code name "Geronimo," a U.S. official said.

Where bin Laden was killed
A senior administration official said later that "Geronimo" was code for the act of capturing or killing bin Laden, not the man himself. The compound is in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The city sits in a mountainous region that is not heavily populated. Many of the residents are army personnel. While senior administration officials would not offer a breakdown of the U.S. mission's composition, a senior defense official said U.S. Navy SEALs were involved. After years of intelligence work and months of following a specific lead, they traced a courier linked to bin Laden to the compound in Abbottabad, the officials said. When first built, the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road, the officials said. In recent years, more residences built up around it, but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area, they said. The mission ordered Friday by Obama found outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire, with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound, the senior administration officials said. The main structure was a three-story building with few windows facing the outside of the compound, and a third-floor terrace had a 7-foot privacy wall, they said. Months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom-built to hide a high-value terrorism suspect, almost certainly bin Laden. The officials noted there was no telephone or Internet service at the dwelling, which was valued at more than $1 million, and its occupants burned their trash rather than leave it out for collection as other area residents did. Calling the U.S. operation a surgical raid, officials said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage. A firefight was under way for most of the 40 minutes that U.S. Special Operations forces were in the compound, as the team encountered resistance from bin Laden and three other men, a senior defense official said. The official said the forces had to fight their way through the first floor of the three-story building, where two adult males lived. Inside the place bin Laden was killed

Bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors, and they were cleared last, with bin Laden killed in the last five or 10 minutes of the siege, the official said. One of bin Laden's wives identified his body to U.S. forces after the team made visual identification, the official said. In the end, all four of the combatants in the compound were dead, along with a woman whom one of the men used as a human shield, the officials said. Sources said bin Laden was shot in the head. John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said it is his understanding that the woman who was killed was one of bin Laden's wives. Later, a senior U.S. official said that bin Laden's wife was not the woman killed and that she may not have been used as a human shield after all. This official also said that bin Laden was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the head. At some point, one of the assaulting helicopters crashed due to a mechanical failure, according to the officials. It was destroyed as the U.S. team flew away, they said. Obama and the senior administration officials said no U.S. forces were harmed in the operation, which took place very early Monday morning Pakistani time. Shandana Syed, a resident doctor in Abbottabad, said she woke up to a large thundering sound. "My initial reaction was that maybe we're being attacked ... I saw the last helicopter. It was flying very low. Initially I was too afraid to get out. I was very terrified," she said. U.S. officials said they used a number of methods to identify the body as bin Laden. One official said it was clear to the assault force that the body matched bin Laden's description, but they used "facial recognition work, amongst other things, to confirm the identity." A senior national security official told CNN that they had multiple confirmations that the body was bin Laden, saying they had the "ability to run images of the body and the face." Another U.S. official told CNN that bin Laden has already been buried at sea. His body was handled in the Islamic tradition, said the official, who did not elaborate. A senior administration official also said bin Laden's body would be "handled in accordance with Islamic practice and tradition. This is something that we take very seriously, and so therefore this is being handled in an appropriate manner." According to the senior administration officials, intelligence work determined at the beginning of 2011 that bin Laden might be located at the compound in Pakistan. By mid-February, the intelligence was considered strong enough to begin considering action pledged by Obama when bin Laden's whereabouts had been determined. To discuss that intelligence and develop a plan, Obama chaired five National Security Council meetings from mid-March until late April, with the last two on April 19 and April 28 -- last Thursday. The next day, on Friday, Obama gave the order for the mission, the officials said. A U.S. official said multiple options were considered before settling on the assault. "A bombing would not have risked American lives but it might have left questions" as to whether Bin Laden was killed, the official said. National security officials widely agreed "the best option is the one that gives proof," the official said. The key break involved one of the few couriers trusted by bin Laden, according to the officials. About two years ago, intelligence work identified where the courier and his brother lived and operated in Pakistan, and it took until August of last year to find the compound in Abbottabad, they said. "When we saw the compound where the brothers lived, we were shocked by what we saw -- an extraordinarily unique compound," one senior administration official said. "The compound sits on a large plot of land in an area that was relatively secluded when it was built. It is roughly eight times larger than the other homes in the area." Noting that the courier and his brother had no discernible source of wealth to live at such a property, intelligence analysts concluded the compound was "custom-built to hide someone of extraordinary significance," the official said, adding: "Everything was consistent with what experts thought Osama bin Laden's compound would look like." U.S. forces also recovered what a senior intelligence official is calling "quite a bit of material." "There's a robust collection of materials we need to sift through, and we hope to find valuable intelligence that will lead us to other players in al Qaeda," the senior intelligence official said. A task force has been set up "because of the sheer volume of material collected. That material is currently being exploited and analyzed," the official added.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Ed Henry, Tom Cohen, Elise Labott, Pam Benson, Dana Bash, Chris Lawrence and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report

How bad is that health 'mistake'?
By Norine Dworkin-McDaniel, Health.com
updated 7:15 AM EDT, Tue July 9, 2013
Research shows people who cross streets while texting are less likely to look before they walk or cross with the light. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Loading up your coffee with extras can add up to 50 calories
That sponge in your sink may be germier than you realize
Don't worry about sitting on the public toilet, doctor says
Try not to postpone regular doctor's appointments
(Health.com) -- We know a bad habit when we see one. Smoking? Check! Not exercising? Duh! Gorging on doughnuts? Of course!
But what about, say, eating lunch at your desk? Turns out that can be worse for you than you'd think (and here we were just trying to be extra-productive).
It's not always easy to know what's good for us and what's not, especially because medical advice keeps changing as new research emerges. (Remember when eating eggs was considered a no-no?) But never fear: We have the lowdown on 10 potentially worrisome everyday habits so you will know just when you can -- and can't -- relax.
You skip a birth-control pill now and then.
The verdict: It won't kill you, but...
It could get you pregnant. For every 100 women using oral contraceptives, between two and nine get pregnant each year, mostly because of errors like forgetting a pill or starting a pack late, says Dr. Lauren Streicher, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
If you miss your daily dose: "Take it as soon as you remember, or take two the next day," she says. "If you skip two pills, take two pills for two days, and use backup birth control, like a condom, for a week."
The best birth control is the one you use consistently, so if you find you're having trouble staying on top of a daily pill, talk to your doc about changing things up -- IUDs and implants, for instance, are effective set-it-and-forget-it options.
Health.com: Are you making these birth control mistakes?
You load up your coffee with extras.
The verdict: It won't kill you, but...
A heavy hand with the condiments adds empty calories to your diet -- especially if you go for extra-large drinks, because you're adding more flavorings than you would for a small cup.
And we're not just talking about whipped cream and mocha syrup: Even stirring in half-and-half and a couple of packs of sugar can add 50 calories to your five-calorie cup of joe. Over a year, if you don't offset those extra calories each day, that's enough to pack on five extra pounds.
That said, if you're generally a healthy eater, then a splash of milk and a little sugar are "not a problem," says Kelly Morrow, associate professor of nutrition at Bastyr University in Seattle. Just stick to real milk. Typically low-fat nondairy creamers are made of mostly corn syrup -- i.e., added sugar -- and trans fats, which research suggests can up your risk for heart disease and other ailments.
Health.com: How to kick the coffee habit
You weigh yourself daily.
The verdict: No worries! Really!
Now, we're not suggesting that you step on the scale every 15 minutes: Body weight can fluctuate by several pounds throughout the day, and watching it bounce up and down like the stock market will drive you bonkers. And it may not help you actually lose weight, according to a recent review of research in The New England Journal of Medicine.
But weighing in once a day, in the morning, after you pee and before you put on your clothes, can be a smart way to keep tabs on whether you've been gaining over time, says Rena Wing, professor of psychiatry at Brown University and director of the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center at the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.
The center is home of the National Weight Control Registry -- a database of more than 10,000 people who have lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off for at least a year.
About 36% of people in the NWCR weigh themselves every day. The trick is to approach the scale as a source of data, not judgment, Wing notes. So even if you're up a smidge, don't let it tank your day.
"Daily weigh-ins allow you to detect small changes before they become big changes," Wing says. "If you're up one pound, you can adjust your eating for a few days and lose it. If you're up 10 pounds, that's going to take some time and work."
Health.com: 16 ways to lose weight fast You use your kitchen sponge till it shreds.
The verdict: It won't kill you, but...
That sponge sitting in your sink is germier than you might realize, according to a study in the American Journal of Infection Control, which found that squeezing out a wet kitchen sponge could leave up to a million potentially illness-causing bacteria (like salmonella and E. coli) on your hands.
If you use it to clean your sink or counters -- especially after you've mopped up raw meat and poultry juices and only quickly rinsed the sponge -- you're just spreading those germs all over the place. Ick, right?
That doesn't mean you should never reuse a sponge. You just have to clean it thoroughly enough to zap the bacteria in it, either by running it through the dishwasher or nuking the damp sponge in the microwave on high for one to two minutes once a week, says Marianne Smith Edge, senior vice president of nutrition and food-safety communications for the International Food Information Council in Washington.
You scarf down lunch at your desk.
The verdict: It won't kill you, but...
When you nosh as you work, especially if you're sitting in front of your computer, you're more likely to overeat, according to research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. When we're distracted, the study showed, we tend not to recall very much about what we've just put in our mouths.
"That blunts the satiety" -- that is, fullness -- "response and leads to overeating," explains lead author Jeff Brunstrom, professor of experimental psychology at University of Bristol in England.
Try to relocate to your office's kitchen or cafeteria, or a spot outside, to eat lunch. But if you don't have that luxury (and really, who does?), Brunstrom recommends at least turning away from the computer screen for the duration of your meal so you can savor each bite.
Health.com: The 25 best diet tricks of all time You text while you walk.
The verdict: Danger! Danger!
Being absorbed in your smartphone while crossing the street is a really great way to become roadkill. In a recent study, people who traversed several busy intersections while texting were four times less likely than non-texters to look before they crossed, cross with the light or stay in the crosswalk. It also took them two seconds longer to navigate the intersection.
"Crossing less cautiously and spending more time in the intersection raises the risk of being hit by a car. We certainly saw some near-misses," says senior study author Dr. Beth Ebel, director of the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center at the University of Washington. "It's dangerous to text when you're doing tasks that require your full concentration."
You sit your bare butt on public toilet seats.
The verdict: No worries! Really!
The toilet seat is probably the cleanest thing you'll touch in a public restroom, according to research done at the University of Arizona, largely because anxious women either use those seat covers or otherwise wipe the seat before touching down. So go ahead and make yourself comfortable!
"There's this idea that if you sit on a toilet seat you're going to get some dreaded disease," Streicher says. "That's just not going to happen. Things like gonorrhea, syphilis and HIV don't live on surfaces. And your vagina doesn't touch the toilet seat; it hangs over the bowl."
So hovering is unnecessary -- and might be more of a nuisance than anything: "When you crouch, you might not empty your bladder completely, so you'll have to go again sooner," Streicher says. "I'm a gynecologist, and I sit down firmly on public toilet seats."
Health.com: 9 things to stop worrying about You pop OTC pain relievers like candy.
The verdict: Danger! Danger!
Stuff hurts and you want it to stop, so you pop an Advil or a Tylenol. Nothing wrong with that. But where this habit starts getting a bit troublesome is if you're regularly taking a lot more than the prescribed daily amount. That can lead to liver issues if acetaminophen is your pain reliever of choice.
If you prefer NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), stomach and/or kidney problems can occur. And if you're one of the 25% of women who get migraines, taking over-the-counter pain relievers two or three times a week for weeks on end can actually cause more headaches, says Dr. Brian Grosberg, co-director of the Montefiore Headache Center in New York. (That's due to a rebound effect that can occur after your body gets used tomedication.)
That doesn't mean you're stuck stiff-upper-lipping it.
"If you need to take a pain reliever a couple of times a day for a couple of weeks for knee pain or after surgery at your doctor's recommendation, that's OK," Grosberg says. "If you're going to take more than the prescribed dose for an extended period, tell your doctor."
Health.com: Surprising ways to fight headache pain
You blow off going to the doctor.
The verdict: It won't kill you, but...
It's very important that you get all your regular preventive screenings, like Pap smears (now recommended every three years for most women), mammograms and cholesterol tests. And you really should visit your doctor if you're not feeling well, says Dr. Ateev Mehtora, associate professor of general internal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
"In a 2007 study we did, most preventive tests ended up being ordered when patients saw their physicians because they were feeling ill."
In an ideal world, you'd also see your primary-care doctor for annual physicals. That way, she can check your vitals, update your chart and recommend any screenings you're missing out on -- and you have a chance to talk to her about any issues you've been having.
That said, if you slip up and skip a year, don't panic: A recent Danish study found that going in for yearly checkups simply because it's "that time again" doesn't lower your risk of an early death. However, do schedule that appointment, if you can, just to be on the safe side.

NRA Reacts To Arkansas School Shooting
By Jonathan Karl/CNN
WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, March 25) -- The Jonesboro, Ark., school shootings have created something of a public relations disaster for groups that oppose gun control.
"What we have to do, again, is take a step back, take a deep breath," says Jim Fotis of the Law Enforcement Alliance of America.
As a former lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, Fotis has seen again and again how tragedies involving guns turn into calls for more gun control.
"It's another reason that some politician that wants to make a name for himself will come out with some piece of feel-good legislation," Fotis said.
The most famous example is the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan that led to Jim Brady's crusade for the Brady Law.
As for the Jonesboro shootings, within 24 hours the calls for gun control could be heard in Congress.
On the House floor Wednesday, Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, "I'm begging every parent with a gun in the home and every gun manufacturer to please, please listen. "You lock your car, you lock your home, you should lock your gun. Every gun should be sold with a child-proof safety lock that only the parents know how to unlock. A borrowed gun, a stolen gun should be a harmless gun," Schumer said. In response to a flood of media inquiries about kids and guns, the NRA has responded with a statement: "We are horrified, shocked, and full of heart-felt remorse for the community and the victims. It extends beyond any political tit-for-tat. This is not a gun issue, it's a society issue and it's troubling." For several years now, the NRA has had a program to keep guns away from
kids featuring the animated character "Eddie the Eagle."
Eddie sings a song for kids encouraging them to stay away from guns they might find: "Stop, don't touch, I'm Eddie Eagle and I like you too much. That's why I'm here to say, if you spot a gun just walk away."
But even this campaign has been criticized by gun control advocates who say Eddie the Eagle actually encourages kids to use guns.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
Filed under: Infectious Diseases
Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections generally acquired by sexual contact. The organisms that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids. Some of these infections can also be transmitted nonsexually, such as from mother to infant during pregnancy or childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles. It's possible to contract sexually transmitted diseases from people who seem perfectly healthy — people who, in fact, aren't even aware of being infected. Many of the infections transmitted through sex cause no symptoms, which is one of the reasons experts prefer the term "sexually transmitted infections" to "sexually transmitted diseases." The symptoms of several sexually transmitted infections are also easy to mistake for those of other conditions, so the correct diagnosis may be delayed. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Symptoms
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have a wide range of signs and symptoms. That's why they may go unnoticed until complications occur or a partner is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms that might indicate an STI include: Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area
Painful or burning urination
Discharge from the penis
Vaginal discharge
Unusual vaginal bleeding
Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread
Signs and symptoms may appear a few days to three months after exposure, depending on the organism. They may resolve in a few weeks, even without treatment, but progression with later complications — or recurrence — sometimes occurs. When to see a doctor See a doctor immediately if you are sexually active and you believe you've been exposed to an STI or you have signs and symptoms of an STI. Make an appointment with a doctor for STI counseling and, if appropriate, for screening tests: When you consider becoming sexually active, or when you're 21, whichever comes first
Before you start having sex with a new partner

Causes
Sexually transmitted infections can be caused by: Bacteria (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia)
Parasites (trichomoniasis)
Viruses (human papillomavirus, genital herpes, HIV)
Sexual activity plays a role in spreading many other infectious agents, although it's possible to be infected without sexual contact. Examples include the hepatitis A and B viruses, shigella, cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Risk factors
Anyone who is sexually active risks exposure to a sexually transmitted infection to some degree. Factors that may increase that risk include: Having unprotected sex. Vaginal or anal penetration by an infected partner who is not wearing a latex condom transmits some diseases with particular efficiency. Without a condom, a man who has gonorrhea has a 70 to 80 percent chance of infecting his female partner in a single act of vaginal intercourse. Improper or inconsistent use of condoms can also increase your risk. Oral sex is less risky but may still transmit germs without a latex condom or dental dam.
Having multiple sex partners. The more people you have sex with, the greater your overall exposure. This is true for concurrent as well as consecutive partners. Each time you break up with one partner and move on to another, even if each relationship is monogamous, your STI risk is increased.
Having a history of one or more STIs. Being infected with one STI makes it much easier for another STI to take hold. If you're infected with herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea or chlamydia and you have unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, you're more likely to contract HIV. Also, it's possible to be reinfected by the same infected partner if he or she isn't treated along with you.
Abusing alcohol or using recreational drugs. Substance abuse can inhibit your judgment, making you more willing to participate in risky behaviors.
Injecting drugs. Needle sharing spreads many serious infections, including HIV and hepatitis B. If you acquire HIV by injecting drugs, you can transmit it sexually.
Being an adolescent female. In adolescent girls, the immature cervix is made up of constantly changing cells. These unstable cells make the adolescent female cervix more vulnerable to certain sexually transmitted organisms.
According to a surveillance report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sexually transmitted infections are more common among certain groups, such as young people, men who have sex with men and minority communities. The theory is that potential sex partners often belong to social networks made up of people of similar age, location and background. Within these overlapping networks, couples regularly form, split up and find new partners. If one STI is making its way through such a network, there's a good chance that others are, too. Transmission from mother to infant Certain STIs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis can be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or delivery. STIs in infants can cause serious problems and may be fatal. All pregnant women should be screened for these infections and treated, if necessary. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Preparing for your appointment
Not many people feel comfortable sharing the details of their sexual experiences, but the doctor's office is one place where such information is essential to appropriate care. What you can do Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance.
Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
Make a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins or supplements, that you're taking.
Write down questions to ask your doctor.
Some basic questions to ask your doctor include: What's the medical name of the infection or infections I have?
How, exactly, is it transmitted?
Will it keep me from having children?
If I get pregnant, could I give it to my baby?
Is it possible to catch this again?
Could I have caught this from someone I had sex with only once?
Could I give this to someone by having sex with that person just once?
How long have I had it?
Should I abstain from sexual activity while being treated?
Does my partner have to go to a doctor to be treated?
What to expect from your doctor Giving your doctor a complete report of your symptoms and sexual history will help your doctor determine how to best care for you. Here are some of the things you may be asked: Do you think you might have a sexually transmitted infection? If so, why? Are you sexually active with men, women or both?
Do you currently have one sex partner or more than one?
How long have you been with your current partner or partners?
Have you ever injected yourself with drugs?
Have you ever had sex with someone who has injected drugs?
What do you do to protect yourself from STIs?
What do you do to prevent pregnancy?
Has a doctor or nurse ever told you that you have chlamydia, herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis or HIV?
Have you ever been treated for a genital discharge, genital sores, painful urination or an infection of your sex organs? How many sex partners have you had in the past year?
How many people have you had sex with in the past two months?
When was your most recent sexual encounter?

Tests and diagnosis
If your sexual history and current signs and symptoms suggest that you have an STI, laboratory tests can identify the cause and detect coinfections you might also have contracted. Blood tests. Blood tests can confirm the diagnosis of HIV or later stages of syphilis.
Urine samples. Some STIs can be confirmed with a urine sample.
Fluid samples. If you have active genital sores, testing fluid and samples from the sores may be done to diagnose the type of infection. Laboratory tests of material from a genital sore or discharge are used to diagnose the most common bacterial and some viral STIs at an early stage.
Screening Testing for a disease in someone who doesn't have symptoms is called screening. Most of the time, STI screening is not a routine part of health care. But there are exceptions: Everyone. The one STI screening test suggested for everyone ages 13 to 64 is a blood or saliva test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. Most health care settings in the United States offer a rapid HIV test with same-day results. Pregnant women. Screening for HIV, hepatitis B, chlamydia and syphilis generally takes place at the first prenatal visit for all pregnant women. Gonorrhea and hepatitis C screening tests are recommended at least once during pregnancy for women at high risk of these infections.
Women age 21 and older. The Pap test screens for cervical abnormalities, including inflammation, precancerous changes and cancer, which is caused by certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV). Experts recommend that, starting at age 21, women should have a Pap test at least every three years. Some experts also advise that women who start having sex before age 21 should have a Pap test within three years of first intercourse.
Women under age 25 who are sexually active. All sexually active women under age 25 should be tested for chlamydia infection. The chlamydia test uses a sample of urine or vaginal fluid you can collect yourself. Some experts recommend repeating the chlamydia test three months after you've had a positive test and been treated. The second test is needed to confirm that the infection is cured, as reinfection by an untreated or undertreated partner is common. A bout of chlamydia doesn't protect you from future exposures. You can catch the infection again and again, so you should get retested if you have a new partner. Screening for gonorrhea is also recommended in sexually active women under age 25.
Men who have sex with men. Compared with other groups, men who have sex with men run a higher risk of acquiring STIs. Many public health groups recommend annual or more frequent STI screening for these men. Regular tests for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea are particularly important. Evaluation for herpes and hepatitis B also may be recommended. People with HIV. If you have HIV, it dramatically raises your risk of catching other STIs. Experts recommend frequent syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes tests for people with HIV. Women with HIV may develop aggressive cervical cancer, so they should have Pap tests twice a year to screen for HPV. Some experts also recommend regular HPV screening of HIV-infected men who risk anal cancer from HPV contracted anally. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Complications
Prompt treatment can help prevent the complications of some STIs. Since many people in the early stages of an STI experience no symptoms, screening for STIs is especially important in preventing complications. Possible complications include: Sores or bumps anywhere on the body
Recurrent genital sores
Generalized skin rash
Pain during intercourse
Scrotal pain, redness and swelling
Pelvic pain
Groin abscess
Eye inflammation
Arthritis
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Infertility
Cervical cancer
Other cancers, including HIV-associated lymphoma and HPV-associated rectal and anal cancers
Opportunistic infections occurring in advanced HIV
Maternal-fetal transmission, which causes severe birth defects

Treatments and drugs
STIs caused by bacteria are generally easy to treat. Viral infections can be managed but not always cured. If you're pregnant and have an STI, prompt treatment can prevent or reduce the risk of infection of your baby. Treatment usually consists of one of the following, depending on the infection. Antibiotics. Antibiotics, often in a single dose, can cure many sexually transmitted bacterial and parasitic infections, including gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Typically, you'll be treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the same time because the two infections often appear together.
Once you start antibiotic treatment, it's crucial to follow through. If you don't think you'll be able to take medication as prescribed, tell your doctor. A shorter, simpler treatment regimen may be available. In addition, it's important to abstain from sex until you've completed treatment and any sores have healed. Antiviral drugs. You'll have fewer herpes recurrences if you take daily suppressive therapy with a prescription antiviral drug, but you can still give your partner herpes at any time.
Antiviral drugs can keep HIV infection in check for many years, although the virus persists and can still be transmitted. The sooner you start treatment, the more effective it is. If you take anti-HIV medication for 28 days, starting as soon as you know you've been exposed, you may avoid becoming HIV-positive. Partner notification and preventive treatment If tests show that you have an STI, your sex partners — including your current partners and any other partners you've had over the last three months to one year — need to be informed so that they can get tested and treated if infected. Each state has different requirements but most mandate that certain STIs be reported to the local or state health department. Public health departments frequently employ trained disease intervention specialists, who can help with partner notification and treatment referrals. Official, confidential partner notification effectively limits the spread of STIs, particularly syphilis and HIV. The practice also steers those at risk toward appropriate counseling and treatment. And since you can contract some STIs more than once, partner notification reduces your risk of getting reinfected. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Prevention
There are several ways to avoid or reduce your risk of sexually transmitted infections. Abstain. The most effective way to avoid STIs is to abstain from sex.
Stay with one uninfected partner. Another reliable way of avoiding STIs is to stay in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who isn't infected.
Get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated early, before sexual exposure, is also effective in preventing certain types of STIs. Vaccines are available to prevent two viral STIs that can cause cancer — human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the HPV vaccine for girls and boys ages 11 and 12. If not fully vaccinated at ages 11 and 12, the CDC recommends that girls and women through age 26 and boys and men through age 21 receive the vaccine. However, men may receive the HPV vaccine through age 26 if desired. The hepatitis B vaccine is usually given to newborns. Wait and verify. Avoid vaginal and anal intercourse with new partners until you have both been tested for STIs. Oral sex is less risky, but use a latex condom or dental dam to prevent direct contact between the oral and genital mucosa.
Use condoms consistently and correctly. Use a new latex condom for each sex act, whether oral, vaginal or anal. Never use an oil-based lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, with a latex condom. Keep in mind that nonbarrier forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives or intrauterine devices, don't protect against STIs.
Don't drink alcohol excessively or use drugs. If you're under the influence, you're more likely to take sexual risks.
Avoid anonymous, casual sex. Don't look for sex partners online or in bars or other pickup places. Not knowing your sex partner well increases your risk of possible exposure to an STI.
Communicate. Before any serious sexual contact, communicate with your partner about practicing safer sex. Reach an explicit agreement about what activities will and won't be OK.
Teach your child. Becoming sexually active at a young age tends to increase a person's number of overall partners and, as a result, his or her risk of STIs. Biologically, young girls are more susceptible to infection. While you can't control your teen or preteen's actions, you can help your child understand the risks of sexual activity and that it's OK to wait to have sex.
Consider male circumcision. There's evidence that male circumcision can help reduce a man's risk of acquiring HIV from an infected woman (heterosexual transmission) by 50 to 60 percent. Male circumcision may also help prevent transmission of genital HPV and genital herpes. Consider the drug Truvada. In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of the drug Truvada to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in those who are at high risk. Truvada is also used as an HIV treatment along with other medications. When used to help prevent HIV infection, Truvada is only appropriate if your doctor is certain you don't already have an HIV or hepatitis B infection. The drug must also be taken daily, exactly as prescribed. And it should only be used along with other prevention strategies such as condom use every time you have sex.
Truvada isn't for everyone. If you're interested in Truvada, talk with your doctor about the potential risks and benefits and whether it's right for you.

Coping and support
It's traumatic to find out you have an STI. You might be angry if you feel you've been betrayed, or ashamed if there's a chance you infected others. At worst, an STI can cause chronic illness and death, even with the best care in the world. Between those extremes is a host of other potential losses — trust between partners, plans to have children, and joyful embrace of your sexuality and its expression. Here's how you can cope: Put blame on hold. Don't jump to the conclusion that your partner has been unfaithful to you. One (or both) of you may have been infected by a past partner.
Be candid with health care workers. Their job is not to judge you, but to stop STIs from spreading. Anything you tell them remains confidential.
Contact your health department. Although they may not have the staff and funds to offer comprehensive services, local health departments maintain STI programs that provide confidential testing, treatment and partner services. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).
