Air Travel
(RealSimple.com) -- I've been married for about as long as the average life expectancy of a hearty Labrador retriever, and the thing I miss most of all about being single is meeting strangers. I love strangers the way Byrd must have loved Antarctica -- because they're uncharted. I don't linger in bars anymore or linger in general the way I did when single, and so I don't meet many strangers. Without going on dates, I don't get to hear strangers tell their life stories over artichoke-cheese--dip appetizers. When I was dating, there were too many stories and too much artichoke-cheese dip. But now I'm wistful for those times. I've even heard that retired coal miners miss the claustrophobic feel of a mine shaft from time to time. (I guess everyone misses their youth.) RealSimple.com: Small, helpful gestures with big impact I got married young and had children immediately. My husband was the breadwinner. I was at home with the kids, running a boarding house for foreigners out of spare upstairs bedrooms. I was so desperate for strangers that I imported them: Koreans, Brazilians, a few Germans. I barely ventured out of the house for years, except to playgrounds with other mothers I knew from the neighborhood. We wore denim overalls and compared teething remedies -- inhabitants of a baby-centric world. RealSimple.com: Make positive changes in your life Then my husband and I ended up swapping roles. He quit his job to become a stay-at-home dad. I had written a book and suddenly had to occupy the role of a professional out in the world. My book-tour itinerary took me to a dozen cities over the course of two weeks. I was obliged to follow it. I dressed in the manner of a professional: black boots, a suede skirt, makeup, a bona fide hairstyle. In the Philadelphia airport, a man sitting off the main thoroughfare looked at me. I tried to place him but couldn't. Another man, sitting nearby, looked at me, too -- equally unfamiliar. And then another. Too late, I realized that the men I was looking at were sitting in an airport bar. They were strangers -- the creepy, ogling variety -- but strangers nonetheless. The entire airport was filled with strangers! Oh, how I'd missed them so! RealSimple.com: Ways to make someone's day Over the next 14 days, I made the acquaintance of countless people. In Birmingham, Alabama, an older southern woman told me her father had been one of the ministers whom Martin Luther King Jr. had addressed in his "Letter From Birmingham Jail." On a cross-country flight, a World War II vet, while recounting the war, started to cry. I cried, too. He said, "It's hell to get old and cry like this when you don't want to." By the end of the trip, I was weary. On the flight back home, I decided to rest. But the stranger next me, a 20-year-old named Brian, wanted to talk. He had one subject: Amy. Brian and Amy had been best friends. They knew each other as babies and dated in high school. She was studying to become a nurse. Brian had left Amy in Massachusetts two years earlier to install car windows in Seattle, escaping difficult parents. He expected Amy to follow. She didn't. When he heard she was engaged, he bought a ticket. He was flying home to tell her he loved her, to win her back. His story was so compelling it had gotten the attention of two flight attendants --a man who looked like a soap star and a stunning African-American woman who seemed to be six feet tall. Both had old-world flight-attendant glamour. The male flight attendant, Chad, had firm ideas about women. He also seemed to have firm ideas about hair products, tanning beds, and many other things that didn't fit into Brian's world. Chad said, "I'll tell you how to win her back, if you want to know." "You don't want to know," the other flight attendant said. Her name was something like Gazelle. Chad was undeterred. "You get a box of rose petals, furry handcuffs, chocolate-covered strawberries, chocolate syrup. And you get a hotel room, a nice one..." "Amy isn't going to fall for rose petals and furry handcuffs," I said. "Women always fall for it," Chad said. Gazelle interrupted. "But Amy may not want to be swept off her feet. She's getting married to someone else." "What if she's not even happy to see me?" Brian said. "Do you love her?" I asked. He nodded. "You've got to give it all you've got," I said. "You have to be honest with her. You need the right words. And I can help." I'm no good at math. I have no spatial aptitude. But I'm good with words, and in that moment, I felt like a doctor on a cruise ship volunteering to deliver a baby on the lido deck. For the next hour, I wrote Amy a love letter. I thought about Amy and Brian and their future kids. (Brian wanted three.) I thought about my husband and how much I missed him, and about our own love story. I wondered, if he had left me to go to Seattle to install windows, would he have rushed back once he heard I was engaged? I thought about all we'd been through together -- a Labrador retriever's lifetime. I wrote to Amy and to myself. I wrote from Brian's heart and my own. I wrote down what I'd always thought marriage should be: a conversation that lasts a lifetime. I handed him the letter. "You'll have to put it in your own handwriting," I said. He read it slowly, sat back in his seat, and closed his eyes. "It's just what I wanted to say." At the end of the flight, I told Brian I wanted to know how it went and gave him my phone number. He promised to call. That night my husband picked me up and we talked all the way home. For the first time in a long time, we had so much to say. When I'd left for the trip, we'd been the ultra-comfortable couple who finished each other's sentences. But now we were both telling stories -- me about the strangers I'd met, the experiences I'd had; him about his adventures in parenting -- and neither of us knew how the other's stories would end. It was as if one inch of each of us had become strangers again. I loved that one newly mysterious inch. When I told him the story about Brian and Amy, I felt lucky, though, too. My husband and I had found each other and stuck together. We were deep into our lifelong conversation. For the first time in a long time, I truly appreciated all that was known and charted between us. At the end of the Brian and Amy story, I told my husband, "If Brian calls and I'm not home, take a message. A yes or a no -- that's all I need to know." I wanted to find out if my love letter had worked. The first few days after the trip, I jumped every time the phone rang. It was never him. Time trudged on. I still think of Brian and Amy every once in a while -- and whether they had three kids or if they even got back together at all. I wonder if they were lucky enough to start their lifelong conversation and, luckier still, to find ways to keep it going.Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE!

Ex-Rep. Tom DeLay says long-running investigation ends with no chargesBy Terry Frieden, CNN Justice Department Producer The federal criminal investigation of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay has been closed. STORY HIGHLIGHTSJustice Department, in line with its standard practice, declines to commentAlleged ties to lobbyist jack Abramoff had been under investigationDeLay still faces a charge in Texas relating to campaign fundraising Washington (CNN) -- The long-running federal criminal investigation of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay has been closed, and no charges will be brought, DeLay said Monday. "As you can imagine, it's a great day for me and my family," DeLay told reporters in a telephone conference call. The Justice Department, as is standard practice, declined any comment on the closing of the probe by its Office of Public Integrity after six years. DeLay said his legal team had received word from the Justice Department last week. "I never did meet with anyone from the Justice Department, even informally," DeLay said. "They never contacted me throughout the process. They didn't have anything." The Texas Republican said he had turned over more than 1,000 documents and all of his computers to federal investigators, and had instructed his aides to fully cooperate with the investigation. Video: DeLay criminal investigation closed
DeLay was under investigation for his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who pleaded guilty in 2006 to fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials. Abramoff admitted defrauding Native American tribal clients of millions of dollars for help in gaining casino licenses. DeLay insisted Monday that he had informed Abramoff that "our relationship is over" when he learned of Abramoff's plans for casinos aboard cruise ships. He also told reporters that during a visit to a casino on a Choctaw reservation he was "disgusted" when he saw a long line of baby carriages lined up while parents were gambling at 11:30 p.m. DeLay's legal troubles are not over. He still faces a charge in Texas relating to campaign fundraising. The Travis County prosecutor has charged DeLay with illegally funneling corporate campaign contributions through the Republican National Committee to Texas Republican candidates in 2002. DeLay says he is currently assisting the Tea Party movement with fundraising by making personal phone calls. He says he still is operating a consulting firm with "both corporate and conservative clients." While DeLay was celebrating Monday, the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington blasted the development. "It's a sad day for America when one of the most corrupt members ever to walk the halls of Congress gets a free pass," said Executive Director Melanie Sloan.

Hundreds gather for funeral of auto racer Dan Wheldon
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 8:37 PM EDT, Sat October 22, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: In a letter read by a friend at the funeral, Wheldon's wife says she's "scared" NEW: Speakers recall Wheldon as a great person and beloved family man, as much as a driver
The Englishman, 33, lived in St. Petersburg with his wife and two young sons
The two-time Indy 500 winner died Sunday after a crash in Las Vegas
(CNN) -- Hundreds gathered Saturday in St. Petersburg, Florida, for the funeral of Dan Wheldon, remembering him as a winning personality and family man as much as a star on the race track.
Born in Emberton, England, Wheldon, a two-time Indianapolis 500 champ, had settled in the west Florida city with his wife and two young sons.
Susie Wheldon spoke to her late husband through a letter read aloud by family friend Michael Johnson at the First Presbyterian Church. Audio from that message, and other parts of Saturday's otherwise private ceremony, were recorded and released by CNN affiliate WTSP.
"I am so scared. Scared I'm going to forget things as time goes by: the way you smell, the sound of your voice, the touch of your hand," she wrote.
Dan Wheldon was near the back of the 34-car field at the Las Vegas Indy 300 on Sunday when he got mixed up in a crash that saw several cars spin out of control and burst into flames, spewing smoke and debris. He died of "blunt head trauma," said an official at the Clark County Coroner's Office, who was not named per the office's policy.
The funeral for the 33-year-old Wheldon stirred resoundingly warm recollections of him as a driver and man.
"We lost a great friend," team owner Roger Penske told WTSP on Saturday outside the Florida church. "We love speed, we take risks, (but) we don't understand tragedy like today."
Wynonna Judd -- whose half-sister Ashley is married to one of Wheldon's pallbearers, driver Dario Franchitti -- sang at the funeral. The speakers included agent Adrian Sussman, who recalled the positive effect that Susie Wheldon and the couple's two boys had on his friend.
Besides those inside, dozens of people stood nearby the church to pay their respects.
In lieu of flowers, friends and fans were asked to donate to the fund or to the Alzheimer's Association, a cause close to the late driver's heart. His mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009.
NASCAR said it will provide teams at the Talladega Superspeedway this weekend with a decal in honor of Wheldon.
The decal features an image of a knight and the word "Lionheart." Wheldon likened himself to Richard the Lionheart, the 12th-century British warrior king, and often wore the image on the back of his helmets.
"When I first started racing, a lot of the guys said that I raced with a lot of heart, occasionally not my head, but always with a lot of heart, like the way that Richard the Lionheart fought in battle," Wheldon wrote on a sponsor's blog in 2010.
IndyCar has said a public memorial service will be held Sunday at the Conseco Fieldhouse in downtown Indianapolis.
"Although the last few days have been unbearable for our family, the overwhelming love and support we have received are rays of sunshine during these dark days. The outpouring of sympathy and condolences has been so comforting, and I want to thank everyone for their kind notes, letters, gifts and flowers," Susie Wheldon said in a statement released Saturday.
CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.

Davos 2013: New year, same old problems?
By Tim Hume, for CNN
updated 8:57 AM EST, Mon January 21, 2013
Delegates arrive at the congress hall at last year's World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The world's political and business elite are gathering in Davos 2,600 delegates will meet under the theme of "resilient dynamism"
The World Economic Forum's Global Risks report offers a pessimistic outlook
It says economic weakness is hampering the world's ability to solve problems
(CNN) -- This month, the world's political and business elite will converge on Europe's highest-altitude town for the annual talk-shop that is the World Economic Forum, held this year under the banner of "resilient dynamism."
The theme, the conference's organizers make clear, is prescriptive rather than descriptive -- a clarion call to the world's leaders, rather than an endorsement of their responses to date in addressing the problems afflicting the global economy.
"The ... new reality that we face is a prolonged global economic malaise, particularly in major economies experiencing economic austerity," Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 1971, said in a statement.
"Future growth in this new context requires dynamism -- bold vision and even bolder action. Either attribute -- resilience or dynamism -- alone is insufficient."
While there has necessarily been plenty of resilience in evidence since the last time delegates gathered at the Swiss ski resort, their responses to major issues like the ongoing eurozone sovereign debt crises and the U.S.'s fiscal cliff could hardly be termed dynamic.
Those issues are likely to be foremost in the minds of those deemed important enough to be admitted entrance to the event, considered one of the world's most exclusive. Attendance to Davos is strictly by invitation only, with only 2,600 "white badges" of attendance issued to representatives from more than 100 countries.
Adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend. While the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups -- heads of state, faith leaders, academics, social entrepreneurs, members of international organizations and news anchors -- for businesses, the cost of a ticket is approximately $20,000. Per-delegate costs can easily rise to double that once travel, accommodation and other expenses are factored in.
Future growth... requires dynamism -- bold vision and even bolder action. Either attribute -- resilience or dynamism -- alone is insufficientKlaus Schwab, World Economic Forum founder
Among the VVIPs on the guest list will be heads of state, royalty, the CEOs of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations.
The delegates will have plenty to talk about. The WEF's own Global Risks 2013 report -- compiled from an annual survey of more than 1,000 experts and industry leaders -- offers a pessimistic outlook, saying the global community's ability to address significant challenges, such as global warming, is undermined by the continuing economic weakness plaguing major economies.
It identifies income inequality and unsustainable government debts as the two issues most likely to have an effect on the global community over the coming decade, and warns of a major systemic financial failure as the most devastating potential outcome.
That weakness in key economic zones is proving stubbornly difficult to remedy. In November, figures were released showing the eurozone has entered a double-dip recession, with the well-documented woes of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy.
Austerity, the bitter medicine that it was hoped would be the cure to Europe's economic malaise, has not only proved hugely unpopular, prompting millions of Europeans to take to the streets in coordinated mass protests in November -- it is also, in the eyes of many economic experts, not working.
IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is among many leading figures who have called for a slowdown in the austerity measures, the impacts of which the organization's chief economist Olivier Blanchard has said were miscalculated.
The only major respite for the eurozone has come courtesy of the "Draghi effect." In September, European Central Bank (ECB) president, Mario Draghi, pledged to buy unlimited amounts of short-term debt from struggling eurozone members, in an attempt to shore up the 17-nation currency bloc, provided they accept certain conditions.
Nevertheless the pain remains severe in many parts of Europe, with Greece in particular enduring the agony of austerity and recession. Its economy is forecast to have contracted 6% in 2012.
Meanwhile the prospect of a government bailout continues to hang over Spain, according to market watchers. Compounding the uncertainty surrounding the eurozone's fourth-largest economy is an upcoming referendum, to be held in 2014, on whether Catalonia -- the country's wealthiest and most industrialized region, containing 16% of the population and producing 19% of its wealth -- wants independence.
The ... new reality that we face is a prolonged global economic malaise, particularly in major economies experiencing economic austerityKlaus Schwab, World Economic Forum founder
Elsewhere in Europe, economists are predicting that Britain -- which is not a member of the eurozone -- will receive a downgrading of its AAA rating this year.
That was the result for the United States, as it suffered the first ever downgrade of its AAA rating last year. Despite lawmakers eventually reaching a deal on the fiscal cliff, political divisions look set to remain an impediment to addressing ongoing financial issues, such as the debt ceiling.
The U.S.'s borrowing has hit its legal limit of $16.394 trillion, prompting the Treasury to resort to "extraordinary measures" to ensure that the government can pay its bills.
If the ceiling is not raised soon, the U.S. faces the risk of defaulting on payments. But despite the painful, drawn-out experience of the fiscal cliff negotiations, indications from political leaders suggest that political partisanship and brinkmanship over financial solutions are set to continue.
And in the Arab world, the ramifications of a wave of upheaval that began two years ago is still playing out. Egypt -- the most populous Arab country, geopolitically significant for its relationship with Israel -- showed encouraging signs when it successfully held election for its first democratically elected leader.
But President Mohamed Morsy's assumption of special powers --a move described by critics as "dictatorial" -- to push through an Islamist-framed constitution outraged secular and liberal groups, among others, triggering fresh waves of protest from Egyptians disenchanted with how the revolution had played out.
The renewed unrest has scared investors, prompting a fresh round of selling of the Egyptian pound, which has hit a series of record lows.
His constitution passed, Morsy now faces an economic battle: to tackle his country's low foreign reserves, 12% unemployment and a large budget deficit, and revive this geopolitically significant North African economy.
The question here, as elsewhere, remains whether 2013 can truly represent a new dawn -- or whether delegates will return to their snowy enclave in Davos in 2014 to address the same set of intractable problems.

Five apps that drove the App Store's success
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 12:49 PM EDT, Thu July 11, 2013 | Filed under: Mobile
When Apple opened its online App Store five years ago, the iPhone got a lot more useful, mobile apps suddenly went mainstream and "there's an app for that" became a cliché. Here are five that soon became indispensable -- or just really popular:
Until Apple launched its own mapping service last year, Google Maps came preloaded on the iPhone. Suddenly, you didn't need to carry a map around with you when visiting a strange city.
Pandora was already a popular desktop music-streaming service, but its appearance on smartphones allowed users to take their personalized tunes on the go. One of the earliest offerings in the App Store, music-discovery app Shazam meant you no longer had to wonder what that song was playing on the radio or in your neighborhood bar. The app now boasts more than 300 million users.
Released in 2009, "Angry Birds" became a phenomenon and heralded the smartphone as a worthy platform for casual games. It's now the most popular paid app of all time for iPhones and iPads. Despite being an iPhone-only platform in its first year and a half, Instagram became hugely popular as a way of snapping and sharing artful photos. The app now has more than 100 million active users.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Apple's App Store arrived five years ago
Users have downloaded more than 50 billion iOS apps Casual game "Angry Birds" is the store's top-selling app ever
Facebook leads most-popular list of free apps, followed by Pandora
(CNN) -- "App" has been a computing term for a lot longer than five years. But, on July 10, 2008, it began its journey to becoming a household word.
That's when Apple, a year after launching the iPhone, introduced its App Store to the world.
The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded.
Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads.

Instagram now lets you share video
But the iPhone was the first smartphone most folks ever saw, and the App Store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness. On this anniversary, we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the App Store and expanded the capabilities of our phones.
'Angry Birds'
Before the App Store, video games were, by and large, for hard-core players with consoles or souped-up PCs. Now the line between who is a gamer and who's not is blurry -- and millions of people have "Angry Birds" to thank. The deceptively addictive little game, in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses, is the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history.
Since its launch in 2009, the game has become a franchise, with spinoffs, toys, cartoons and even a movie making up just part of Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment's furious, feathered empire.
Addicted gamers are sweet on 'Candy Crush'
Google Maps
With the rise of Google's Android system as Apple's chief mobile rival, there's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the App Store's success. But since Google Maps rolled out as a native app for the iPhone, the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing's key features. (Does anyone still hand-draw maps?)
Yes, there are other map apps out there. But Google's treasure-trove of data makes its maps a go-to for millions. Witness the mini-disaster Apple had on its hands when it bumped Google's offering for its own Maps app last year. Apple's product was so half-baked that CEO Tim Cook, in a rare mea culpa, essentially told users to download Google Maps until it was fixed.

Pandora
By 2008 Pandora already had become a popular Web-streaming service, letting users seed their own personal radio stations with bands or songs they liked. But the company was quick to see the potential in mobile computing, and Pandora was among the first apps available when the App Store went live.
Since then, it's become the second-most downloaded iPhone app in the store's history, trailing only Facebook. Its proof of concept -- that users want to be able to bring their music with them anywhere -- also helped inspire a host of competitors, from Spotify to Rdio to Last.fm.
Why everybody's building a Web music service
Instagram
Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, made all of us photographers. That's a huge shift. But, sadly for most of us, it didn't make us all good photographers. Enter Instagram -- with a slate of editing tools and funky filters that can make even the most pedestrian pictures look good. Add to that Instagram's social features, complete with Twitter-like hashtags, and you've got a tool tailor-made for mobile.
Launched in 2010 by Stanford University students, Instagram now moves about 45 million images every day. Oh ... and those creators also sold it to Facebook last year for a cool $1 billion.
Instagram launches 15-second video feature
Shazam
It seems like a little thing, until you stop and think about it: What if your phone could listen to a few seconds of a song, then tell you what it is? That would have sounded like magic not so many years ago. Now, we take it for granted. Shazam started in the UK in 2002 as a Web service.
But it was front and center at the beginning of the mobile revolution, and is now among Apple's Top 10 downloaded apps, with 350 million users.

Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe: Treve thrashes male rivals as Japan misses out again
updated 1:47 PM EDT, Sun October 6, 2013
Jockey Thierry Jarnet celebrates after filly Treve romps to victory at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Treve wins Europe's biggest racing prize, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
French filly wins by five lengths from Japanese favorite Orfevre
It is the third year in a row that a filly has beaten the colts at l'Arc
Orfevre was also runner-up last year, disappointing the visiting Japanese fans
Winning Post is CNN's monthly horse racing show. Click here for videos, news and features.
(CNN) -- When it comes to the richest horse race on the European circuit, the girls are definitely beating the boys.
Treve became the third successive filly to win the $5.4 million Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday, following in the example of Solemia and Danedream, plus Zarkava in 2008.
The French-bred three-year-old romped to the fifth successive race win of her career, beating Japanese favorite Orfevre by five lengths at Longchamp.
Jockey Thierry Jarnet made the most of his late call-up as replacement for Frankie Dettori, who broke his ankle on Wednesday, as the 46-year-old captured his third Arc -- and first since 1994.
"It was a different era when I was riding for Andre Fabre and I'm just pleased to show I can still be effective," Jarnet said.

"This is beautiful, more in a way for the filly than for myself, as I have a strong affinity with her."
Read: Big in Japan - and invading Paris
Trained by Criquette Head-Maarek, who in 1979 became the first woman to prepare an Arc winner, Treve is owned by Qatar's Sheikh Joaan Bin Hamad Al Thani.
"I want to say thank you to Frankie Dettori as he rode an amazing race on her in the Prix Vermeille. I said to save her for today and he did," Head-Maarek said of Treve, which also won last month's Grade One warmup race to be only the sixth horse to complete that double.
"I am sorry he is not here today. The way she won was incredible. She was wide the whole way and was traveling so easily the jockey just said he just let her go.
"I'm surprised how well she won, as we've never pushed her. I thought she had six gears, but today she put the seventh one on."
Treve's connections said her triumph came despite running with "her nose the the wind."
"The right horse always manages to get herself out of difficult situations," Jarnet said.
Breeder Alec Head added: "It is extraordinary! She had the worst possible race and yet won brilliantly. What a filly! I have trained good horses, but ones like that ..."
It was another disappointment for the thousands of Japanese fans who again flocked to Longchamp, with Orfevre falling short for the second year in a row
"Treve took off at the 350 and we couldn't follow her," said his Belgian jockey Christophe Soumillon.
"I was hoping she would stop, but she didn't. I'm very sorry for the Japanese fans, owners and trainers who want to win this beautiful race and keep finishing second."
Another Japanese hopeful, Kizuna, was fourth behind Fabre's German-bred, French-trained Intello.

10 things Canada does better than anywhere else
By Jordan Rane, for CNN
updated 12:55 PM EST, Tue December 17, 2013
"Oops sorry, was my face in the way of your fist?" A study titled "Sorry ... I'm Canadian," reports 90% of Canadians aged 18-25 apologize if a stranger bumps into them. Travelers should still be wary of niceties, notes one Canadian: "Sometimes we're actually expressing our sympathy for your shortcomings." Canada has more lakes than any other country -- about 3 million. Ontario alone contains about a third of the world's freshwater. Recently, National Geographic Traveler called the lake district of Muskoka the top summer destination -- in the world.
"Capote"? You're not in Kansas, Dorothy. But Winnipeg. "Twilight?" Vancouver. "Titanic?" Much of it filmed off the coast of Halifax. Even if you've never set foot in Canada, you've been staring at it for years without knowing it. Hollywood loves filming here. A national air quality study put Canada third for the cleanest air on the planet. Until first and second placers (Estonia and Mauritius) are covered in CNN Travel's "better than anywhere else" series, we direct your breath to Canadian cities—which average a relatively pristine 13 micrograms of PM10 particles per cubic meter.
Canadians are hilarious -- sometimes even intentionally -- as a disproportionate number of comic heavyweights like Jim Carrey, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Dan Aykroyd, Seth Rogen, Mike Myers, Phil Hartman, Michael Cera and many others have confirmed over the years.
"Canadian chocolate is higher in fat and it is a higher particle size," a Hershey's chocolate expert noted in the National Post, adding that Hershey's offers a separate recipe for the discriminating Canadian chocolate palate. That's why eating Canadian faves like Caramilk, Aero, Mr. Big, heck even Sweet Marie in Saskatoon, is a creamy, velvety experience. Lake Louise is in gorgeous Banff National Park. BC's Whistler Blackcomb got a "best in North America" nod from SKI Magazine last year. Heli-skiing? That all started in the Canadian Bugaboos, still one of the best places to do it.
No national symbol is as ubiquitous as Canada's maple leaf. Especially abroad, flag-bearing Canadian travelers make sure everyone's clear who they are at a glance. Not American. Not German. Not Rarotongan. Canadian. See the leaf? Canadian. Tim Hortons. Harvey's. Swiss Chalet. If you don't know these names, it's time to look beyond the Golden Arches. Nothing says gustatory bliss on the Trans-Canada Highway like a peameal & natural smoked Bacon Bacon burger, or half-chicken plate with Chalet sauce, or a box of Timbits with a double-double coffee. While you'll be hard-pressed to find a real-life, toque-wearin' local who's ever called someone a "hoser," Canadians do call cases of beer "two-fours" and napkins "serviettes" in polite company. Nowhere else will you be "given the gears" if you do something dumb or alerted that "your gitch is showing" if your belt is too loose. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Poll titled "Sorry ... I'm Canadian," finds 90% of Canadians aged 18-25 apologize if a stranger bumps them
Even if you've never visited Canada, chances are you've been staring at it in Hollywood movies
"Canadian chocolate is higher in fat and it is a higher particle size," says a Hershey's expert
Editor's note: This story is part of a series highlighting superlatives of countries around the world. Click here for pieces on Italy, the United States, India and South Korea, and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries. (CNN) -- Who wouldn't expect great things from the world's second largest land mass?
This is a nation hoarding enough prosperity, natural beauty and curling talent to serve a population a hundred times its size.
But Canada is more than elbow room, good roads, respected banks, promo posters of Mounties on horseback, sweet views of Niagara Falls and tired media frenzies about the odd crack-smoking mayor.
This country could really brag about all the stuff that truly sets it apart.
Not that it ever would.
Self-effacing modesty is one the more endearing Canadian virtues -- along with these 10 national assets that really put the "O" in Canada.

1. Apologizing
It's not so easy to get a simple apology in most of the world.
Being jostled in India. Getting your foot stepped on in Greece. Not having the door held open for you in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.
That's just all part of unrepentant life.
In Canada, apologies happen constantly -- "sorries" flying in from all sides like swarms of affable killer bees.
Apologies are issued not just for some negligible mishap, but for actually having the gall to be on the receiving end of one.
A Queen's University poll titled "Sorry ... I'm Canadian," found that 90% of Canadians aged 18-25 will immediately apologize if a stranger bumps into them.
But while it may be true that some of the ugliest brawls in Canada have been waged over who's sorrier, travelers should be wary of such niceties, notes another Canadian apologist: "Sometimes we're actually expressing our sympathy for your shortcomings."

2. Lakes and "Cottage Country"
Canada has more lakes than any other country -- about 3 million.
The province of Ontario alone contains about a third of the world's freshwater, spread over 250,000 lakes.
No surprise that "heading up to the lake" is more than just a favorite national phrase.
It's Canada's sacred version of lighting out for the territory -- but with cottages furnished with Muskoka chairs, Kevlar canoes and competing Gordon Lightfoot and loon mating call soundtracks.
Recently, Ontario's prime lake district, Muskoka, got the nod from National Geographic Traveler as the top summer destination -- in the world.
Well, yeah, eh? It's beauty up there.

You're not in Kansas, "Capote" fans. But Winnipeg. Even if you've never set foot in Vancouver, Halifax or those handful of cities in between, you've frequently been staring right at them without knowing it.
Why?
Because Hollywood loves making movies in Canada -- big movies -- while passing the settings off as New York City, Wyoming, ancient Persia, the bow of history's most ill-fated oceanliner ...
Basically anywhere else but Canada.
If you've sat through "The Incredible Hulk," you've visited Toronto's Yonge Street -- at least via celluloid.
"Brokeback Mountain"? That ain't the American West, pardner. It's Southern Alberta's Rocky Mountain country.
"Capote"? You're not in Kansas, Dorothy. But Winnipeg.
"Twilight"? Vancouver.
"Blades of Glory"? Montreal.
"Titanic"? Much of it filmed off the coast of Halifax.
And where in the world was Morgan Freeman's shack in "Unforgiven"? Just up the road from Calgary in the Drumheller Valley -- a moonscape-ish backcountry that's also passed for Egypt, Persia, Armenia and East Africa in several film and TV productions.

4. Air
In a recent national air quality study by the World Health Organization, Canada placed third for the cleanest air on the planet.
Until the first and second placers (Estonia and Mauritius) are covered in CNN Travel's "better than anywhere else" series, we direct your breath to Canadian cities -- which average a relatively pristine 13 micrograms of PM10 particles per cubic meter.

5. Humor
Canadians are hilarious -- sometimes even intentionally -- as a disproportionate number of comic heavyweights like Jim Carrey, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Dan Aykroyd, Seth Rogen, Mike Myers, Phil Hartman, Michael Cera, Leslie Nielsen and so many others have repeatedly confirmed over the years.
What makes Canadians so crazy funny?
The subject has launched sociological studies, none of which are funny at all.
But even if you've never watched SCTV, can't name a single member of "The Kids in the Hall" and weren't aware that SNL was created and produced by a Torontonian, or that Montreal's Just for Laughs Festival is the world's biggest comedy festival, or that the most deadly funny movie sequence ever filmed (the "Serpentine!" scene from 1979's "The In-Laws") was directed by a dude from Edmonton -- know this:
If there's one thing Canada barrels superbly at home or abroad, for whatever boring reason, it's laughs.

6. Chocolate bars
Fatty, velvety chocolate goes down best with Canadians.
Just a few giant corporations pump out most of the world's mass market candy bars -- but not always with the same goods under that familiar-looking wrapper.
"Canadian chocolate is higher in fat and it is a higher particle size," a Hershey's senior chocolate expert recently noted in the National Post, adding that Hershey's now offers a separate recipe for the more discriminating Canadian chocolate palate.
"Americans tend to gravitate toward a little more of a grittier or even cheesier flavor."
That's why eating any of those generic chocolate bars or local Canadian faves like Caramilk, Aero, Mr. Big, heck even Sweet Marie in Saskatoon, is a creamy, velvety experience.
And why a KitKat somewhere else is a gritty, cheesy, polyglycerol polyricinoleate-y one.

7. Ski country
Sitting across the border from Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Vermont would be intimidating to most countries hawking their own powdery slopes.
Not Canada, which boasts some of the best reasons to haul your skis or snowboard a little farther north.
In the West, there's Lake Louise, plunked right in gorgeous Banff National Park, and a ring of powder havens throughout eastern British Columbia. Whistler Blackcomb is one of the world's leading ski resorts, getting a "best in North America" nod from SKI Magazine last year.
In the East, there's Quebec's beer-commercial-fun Laurentians -- where après-ski needs no translation.
Heli-skiing? That all started in the Canadian Bugaboos, which remains one of the best places to do it.

8. Nation branding
No national symbol is as ubiquitous as Canada's maple leaf.
From Newfoundland to Victoria, it's everywhere you look -- a proud, unrelenting reminder of where you are. Not the United States. Not Australia. Not Nigeria. Canada.
The most obsessive leaf activity occurs abroad, where generations of flag-bearing Canadian backpackers are famous for sewing maple leaf patches onto their bags just to make sure everyone's clear at a glance who they are.
Not American. Not German. Not Rarotongan. Canadian. See the leaf? Canadian.
"No other country on earth seems to feel the same need to self-identify," posts one traveler from an undisclosed country.
9. Highway grub
Nothing says gustatory bliss on the Trans-Canada Highway like Timbits with a double-double coffee. Road trips are all about the food.
At least in places like Alberta or Manitoba, where nothing works up an appetite like hours of sedentary driving along some of the longest, straightest roads known to non-Australian mankind with nothing to do but count Petro-Canada stations -- and pull over for the best comfort food gracing any rest stop.
Tim Hortons. Harvey's. Swiss Chalet ...
If you don't know these names, it's time to look beyond the Golden Arches.
You can eat McNuggets wherever.
Nothing says gustatory bliss on the Trans-Canada Highway like a peameal & natural smoked Bacon Bacon burger, or half-chicken plate with Chalet sauce, or a box of Timbits with a double-double coffee.
Better grab a butter tart and Nanaimo bar, too. It's a long way from Red Deer to Flin Flon.

10. Adorable terms and phrases While you'll be hard-pressed to find a real-life, toque-wearin' local who's ever called someone a "hoser" or told them to "take off," Canadians do call their two-dollar coins "Toonies," cases of beer "two-fours" and napkins "serviettes" in polite company.
Nowhere else will you be called a "rink rat" for loitering at ice arenas.
Or be "given the gears" if you do something dumb.
Or get asked, "What do you pay for hydro?"
Or alerted that "your gitch is showing" if your belt is too loose.
Enough said.
