Student wins battle against plagiarism-detection requirement
By Emanuella GrinbergCourt TV
Story Tools
(Court TV) -- After refusing to submit his class work to a plagiarism-detection Web site, a 19-year-old sophomore has become the first college student to challenge university policy on the issue� --�and win.
The senate committee at McGill University in Montreal�sided�last Thursday with sophomore Jesse Rosenfeld, who�argued�that he should not be required to submit his essays to Turnitin.com, a Web site that verifies originality by comparing documents to thousands of others.
Though the ruling was a boon to student organizations across Canada and the United States who have protested use of the plagiarism-detection site, Turnitin.com insists it is in compliance with all related copyright laws.
The conflict began in October, when Rosenfeld refused to hand in essays for his international development studies class through the Web site. He received failing grades for his assignments.
Rosenfeld filed an appeal with the university senate committee. Afterward, his professor "reluctantly" agreed to grade his papers without submitting them through the online plagiarism-detection program� --�giving him Bs and Cs for his work.
Rosenfeld said he had "an ethical and political problem" with the university's policy of submitting student work to Turnitin.com.
"I was having to prove I didn't plagiarize even before my paper was looked at by my professor," Rosenfeld said, according to the Globe and Mail.
Rosenfeld wasn't the only one concerned. Several on-campus groups have voiced opposition to the site, and the national body representing all Canadian student organizations, the Canadian Federation of Students, recently took up a policy position against it.
"Of the 20 Canadian universities currently using the site, not one consulted with students in the decision-making process when signing on with Turnitin.com," said Ian Boyko, national chairman of the CFS. "That in itself shows a lack of respect for students' rights."
Boyko also believes universities should not be permitted to turn over essays to sites like Turnitin.com, which he said makes money off students' work without their consent.
"The student is the author of the work, and deserves to be part of the decision as to where his work goes," Boyko said.
John Barrie, founder and president of Turnitin.com, said such accusations are groundless and made without due diligence.
"This is the first time since our inception in 1998, since millions of papers have gone through our site, that this issue has come up," Barrie said. "We are following the letter of the law, and not one of the 3,000 universities who use our service would have signed contracts with us if we weren't."
Because student work exists in Turnitin.com's database solely as digital fingerprints and not as collections of essays, Barrie disputes accusations that the company makes unfair use of students work.
"The value to our company is not in the collection of words and characters in an essay, but in the series of numbers derived from the essay once we transform those words and characters into digital fingerprints," Barrie said. "In short, the value to us is not derived from the student's actual work."
Barrie�says in this way, Turnitin.com does not violate students' copyrights to their work, adding that students retain control over their copy.
"We don't harm the free-market value of the work� --�a student can take their Macbeth essay to the market and make millions," he said.
But, according to CFS, sites like Turnitin.com present an even broader political issue.
"We see the use of sites like Turnitin.com as means of cutting corners," Boyko said. "We think they are a poor substitute for trained individuals."
A former professor who launched the site after students complained of the proliferation of plagiarism because of the Internet, Barrie sees little merit in that argument.
"Human beings can't detect plagiarism," he said, and referred to a Rutgers University study that found 40 percent of students polled admitted they plagiarized at least once.
"Unless you apply a digital solution, it's impossible. We have 13 seven-foot, computer racks to determine if a student has lifted one line in an essay from the Internet."

U.S. expelling Venezuelan envoy in response to ChavezStory Highlights U.S. move on Venezuelan ambassador follows similar action by Caracas Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez expelling the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela U.S. Treasury Department also accuses Venezuelans of aiding Colombian rebels U.S. in escalating diplomatic battle with Venezuelan, Bolivian leaders Next Article in World » WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States is expelling the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States in response to a similar move by Venezuela, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Friday. "We have informed the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States that he will be expelled and should leave the United States," McCormack said. Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department accused Friday two senior Venezuelan intelligence officials -- Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios and Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva -- and one former official -- Ramon Rodriguez Chacin -- of assisting leftist rebels in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, with narcotics trafficking. "Today's designation exposes two senior Venezuelan government officials and one former official who armed, abetted and funded the FARC, even as it terrorized and kidnapped innocents," said Adam J. Szubin, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a statement. The action freezes assets the three men may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans from conducting business with them. The U.S. decision to expel the Venezuelan ambassador, Bernardo Alvarez Herrera, is the latest move in an escalating diplomatic battle that pits the United States against two of Latin America's leftist leaders. It comes a day after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that he was expelling the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, Patrick Duddy. Chavez also said he was recalling the Venezuelan ambassador from the United States. Don't Miss Venezuela to expel U.S. ambassador
Deadly clashes strike Bolivia's east
Russian bombers land in Venezuela "He has 72 hours, from this moment, the Yankee ambassador in Caracas, to leave Venezuela," Chavez told a crowd of supporters. "When there's a new government in the United States, we'll send an ambassador. A government that respects Latin America." The president said he was making the moves "in solidarity with Bolivia and the people of Bolivia." Bolivian President Evo Morales on Thursday accused the United States of fomenting a coup d'etat by rich eastern department landowners against him, and he called for the U.S. ambassador to leave for allegedly encouraging those protesters. For the past two weeks, the demonstrators in the country's richer eastern lowlands have been protesting Morales' plans to redistribute the country's natural gas revenues. "Without fear of anyone, without fear of the empire, today before you, before the Bolivian people, I declare the ambassador of the United States persona non grata," Morales said Wednesday of Ambassador Philip Goldberg in a nationally televised speech. The United States called the allegations baseless and kicked out the Bolivian ambassador Thursday. The Bolivians "made it very clear what their intention was and we took them at their word," McCormack said Friday. "We take President Chavez at his word in this particular case, and we have reacted appropriately." Before expelling the U.S. diplomat from his country, Chavez also said Thursday that he had uncovered a U.S.-backed plot to remove him from power. "It's the empire that's behind this," he told supporters in a televised address. "They go around looking for a way to stop our revolution and, with it, to strike all the processes of change that are occurring in our Americas, in the Caribbean, in Central America." Chavez then played a four-minute tape of what he said were conversations among current and retired members of the Venezuelan military discussing whom they could count on to support a movement against the presidential palace. He said also that the presence of two Russian warplanes on Venezuelan soil for a training exercise "is a warning" to the rest of the world that Venezuela's allies include Russia.

Men ditch 'nice guy' style, get more datesBy Stephanie Chen, CNN Art Malov, founder of New York Dating Coach, advises guys to stop being so nice. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Some guys want to avoid being prematurely lumped into the nice guy category Dating coaches say being too nice can drive women away and appear weak Relationship experts are advising men to stop being as predictable and flexible "I find that when the guy is sweet and polite ... it throws the balance off," one woman said RELATED TOPICS
Relationships
Sexuality
Marriage
Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Dean Melcher was the kind of guy who befriended girls easier than boys. He was a tad shy, consistently thoughtful and surrounded by women, but he still couldn't get a girlfriend. "I think I was kind of clueless and oblivious," admits Melcher, who spent his early 20s lingering in the friend zone. "Women wanted the bad boys." Everyone probably knows a Mr. Nice Guy like Melcher, who is now 46. He's the guy who patiently listens to a girl complain without interrupting her. Because of his sweet nature, he puts the girl's demands first, altering his weekend plans to fit her schedule. He may be uneasy about making a decision for fear of being domineering. But after all his diligent efforts to be a gentleman, she turns him down, and he is left to wonder: Do nice guys finish last? "Girls might say they want a nice guy, but what they really want is the cool guy," said Arthur Malov, founder of New York Dating Coach, a relationship consulting agency with primarily male clients. "A jerk is rarely so bad that no one wants to hook up with him." Now, some single guys are taking steps to avoid being lumped into the nice guy category. Malov's agency, which coaches single men from all over the U.S. and as far away as Japan and Norway, instructs clients to steer away from the polished, predictable image. The dating coach tells men to stop being so available and flexible. He advises the men to leave a little mystery because women, despite what they say, do desire the chase. Malov says the nice-guy persona is the No. 1 problem cited by his male clients, and he explains why, using the game of poker. "A lot of nice guys are showing all his cards and saying, 'What should I do?' " he says. "After that, nothing happens." Video: Embracing manliness
The Modern Man, a company based in Australia that provides dating advice, suggests a similar anti-nice guy solution: Stop wasting money on expensive dates, and don't always cater to her needs first. "Realize that women don't want you to hand over your power by being a Mr. Nice Guy in return for their affection, love and attention," said Dan Macon, who runs The Modern Man. "Sure, women want you to show them respect and love, but they also want you to be a man and take charge. If you can't do that, women won't want to be with you." Neil Strauss, author of the "The Game," a best-seller that explores ways for men to pick up women, once found himself in the Mr. Nice Guy category. He was friends with a girl he liked. He was painting her walls one time when she left to go on a date with another guy. Strauss quickly figured out that women desire someone who is kind but also has a backbone and is confident. "The dichotomy isn't between good guys or bad guys," he explained. "It's between weak guys and strong guys." Being a nice guy has always backfired in relationships, says 21-year-old David, a University of Connecticut student who declined to give his last name. He said he used to put women on a pedestal -- giving them thoughtful gifts and taking them out to fancy dinners. But he stopped doing those things over the last two months and made himself less available. He's not trying to be cocky or mean to women, but his new attitude is getting him more dates. "I'm starting to think: What should someone offer me?" he said. Robert Glover, author of the 2003 book "No More Mr. Nice Guy," says the nice guy personality is usually developed at a young age and is probably shaped by the guy's parents. For example, he found some men with the nice guy persona were heavily influenced by their mothers. Other men were trying to avoid a macho-male personality or philandering behavior displayed by the father. As a licensed counselor in Washington, he's listened to many men groan about being in the nice guy rut. Glover said that nice guys, like himself, were often nonconfrontational and constantly seeking approval -- both destructive behaviors in a relationship. Being too nice landed him in divorce court. "In general, women like the tension, or they will lose interest quickly," he said. This nice guy backlash may sound unpleasant, but some men blame women who disregard the nice guy as an option. Some women interviewed say they equate a nice guy with being a boring guy. Others used words like "marshmallow," "doormat" and even "creeper." Academic studies have reaffirmed that women prefer the bad boy archetype over the nice guy. A 2008 study at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces examined how college students perceived "dark" traits such as thrill-seeking behavior, deceitfulness and narcissism. The study found the female students preferred the males with these traits. In her seven years of dating coach experience, Lisa Shield of Los Angeles, California, discovered that a majority of female clients prefer a man with edge who draws boundaries. Her clients reject nice guys as too malleable. "I find that when the guy is sweet and polite, I tend to become the more masculine of the two of us," said 39-year-old Lisa Lyons of California. "It throws the balance off." Despite this attitude, some dating coaches say that women should keep an open mind. The negative stereotypes of a nice guy aren't always true; the men aren't always timid or easy pushovers. While the nice guys may not be as forward or loud, their selfless personality can be valuable to a lasting relationship, they say. Being Mr. Nice Guy worked to Melcher's advantage when he met his future wife when he was 23. She strolled into the bank where he worked one day, and he seemed nice, so she asked him out to coffee that day -- a date that would evolve into a successful marriage. Sometimes, all it takes is for the girl to give the nice guy a chance.

Bill Clinton to visit Haiti By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSCholera has killed more than 2,000 people in HaitiThe country is still reeling from an earthquake nearly a year agoA recent presidential election has caused controversy New York (CNN) -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to visit Haiti on Wednesday to discuss the recent cholera outbreak and efforts to rebuild after a punishing earthquake, the Clinton Foundation said. An outbreak of cholera has killed more than 2,000 people and sickened nearly 100,000 in Haiti, which still is reeling from an earthquake in January that killed about 220,000 people. Clinton's visit also comes amid controversy after a disputed presidential election. The country's Provisional Electoral Council said former first lady Mirlande Manigat finished first in the November 28 vote, followed by Jude Celestin, the candidate backed by outgoing president Rene Preval. Since no candidate won a majority, the council said, a runoff election will be held on January 16. The candidate that the council said finished third, musician Michel Martelly, alleged fraud and said that he won the election. Martelly has proposed a fresh round of voting and said the troubled electoral council should be dumped. His supporters have protested the election results.

Somali Pirates
(CNN) -- Somali pirates released a chemical tanker after holding it for more than four months, the European Union's naval protection force said Thursday. The MV Hannibal II was seized November 11 off the Horn of Africa, EU NAVFOR said. All 30 members of the crew of the Panama-flagged vessel are safe and in good health, the naval force said, citing the owner of the ship. The waters off the coast of largely lawless Somalia have become a danger zone for ships in the past several years as pirates seize them for ransom. EU NAVFOR did not say if a ransom had been paid for the Hannibal II.

By Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 6:19 PM EDT, Fri September 28, 2012
The public gets its first glimpse of James Holmes, 24, the suspect in the Colorado theater shooting during his initial court appearance Monday, July 23.

Colorado massacre: Mourning the victims
It's unclear, because the name of the threatened person has been redacted, whether he or she is the psychiatrist who was treating Holmes at the university.
The notion that Holmes was blocked from campus is incongruous with the university's statements that he was denied access to non-public portions of the campus because he had withdrawn from classes.
Holmes was a Ph.D. candidate studying neuroscience at the Anschutz campus in Aurora, the Denver suburb where the shooting took place.
Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, the attorneys argue that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops their enrollment.
The documents also say the defense made a motion to ask the court to sanction prosecutors for making such statements in court. The judge declined to punish the prosecution but warned them against "making assertions about the defendant which may be contradicted later by the facts."
In an unusual move, the judge will allow the defense team to go against a standing gag order and release a public statement responding to the prosecution's depiction that Holmes was blocked from campus.
A call from Holmes?
Just nine minutes before he burst into a suburban mall movie theater, Holmes tried to call but failed to reach Dr. Lynne Fenton, prosecutors have said.
Last week, a judge ruled that a notebook mailed to Fenton would not be accessible to prosecutors. The court did allow that Holmes' lawyers could look at it.
Fenton testified that her contact with Holmes ended June 11. She said she later contacted campus police because she was very concerned about her last meeting with him. She declined to detail what bothered her.
In August, public defender Tamara Brady said in court that Holmes called a University of Colorado switchboard nine minutes before he went into the movie theater in Aurora, a suburb of Denver.
The number can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said.
Texts from Holmes?
The documents also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting.
That person was not named, and the content of the texts were not made public.
Police interviewed that person and, with their permission, examined the phone. Police downloaded the complete contents of the phone because, according to the documents, law enforcement didn't have the technical ability to isolate only the relevant text messages involving Holmes.
The witness was concerned that contacts and other personal information may be vulnerable, so the defense received a redacted portion of more than 2,000 pages of material from the cell phone.
In August, court documents claimed that Holmes "had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people" months before the shooting.
"The defendant had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people in March 2012, and that he would do so when his life was over," said the document released in August. No other details were provided about those conversations.
Media requested more information
The documents were released because the media has continuously tried to get the court to release more information about movie theater murders.
A probable-cause affidavit, a document that typically lays out the details of a case, has not been released.
Officials are under a gag order issued by Judge William Sylvester to protect Holmes' rights.
CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.

Google search reveals true identity of suspect in Navy charity scam By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 4:56 PM EDT, Mon October 1, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Bobby Thompson" is John Donald Cody, a fugitive Arizona lawyer, officials say
Cody, now 65, disappeared in 1984 as IRS agents were investigating him for fraud
Cody allegedly founded a fake charity that stole $2 million intended for veterans
"Thank goodness for Google," U.S. marshal says
(CNN) -- A bored U.S. marshal using Google connected an alleged scam artist arrested this year under an alias to a lawyer who disappeared decades ago before he was indicted on federal fraud charges.
The suspect in a fake charity scam that stole millions in donations intended for Navy veterans is also wanted by the FBI for questioning in a spy case, federal officials said.
When U.S. marshals arrested "Bobby Thompson" five months ago, they said they knew he was using a fake name. He's been held in the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, jail since then.
"We always knew there was a reason that 'Thompson' signed his name as 'Mr. X' and did not want to be identified," U.S. Marshal Pete Elliott said Monday. "We now know why."
His real name John Donald Cody, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1972, served as a captain in the U.S. Army's military intelligence unit, worked as a lawyer in Arizona and speaks "many, many different foreign languages," Elliott said.
Cody, now 65, disappeared in 1984 as IRS agents were investigating him in a case that led to his indictment in 1987 on four counts, including making false statements to an investment brokerage firm, taking stolen funds across state lines and lying on a loan application, according to court documents.
But time and technology caught up with Cody when Elliott opened his web browser and began a series of Google searches.
"I happened to be a little bored that Friday afternoon," Elliott said Monday. "Thank goodness for Google."
He searched for cold-case fraud fugitives with ties to military, he said. Google images yielded a 1969 photo of a man with a pompadour hairstyle in a military uniform and several later photos of the same man with a similar haircut, he said.
Both Cody and Thompson favored the pompadour, he said.
"In our profession, one and one always equals two, and I believe man is always a creature of habit, no matter what identity he takes," Elliott said.
He also found an FBI wanted flyer for a cold-case fraud fugitive wanted since 1987. It was from 1987 when the FBI began searching for Cody.
Since Cody fled before he was arrested, the FBI had no fingerprints to compare to Thompson. But the military did, and they matched, Elliott said.
The "Thompson" case drew a lot of attention in May when "Thompson" was arrested in Oregon after a two-year nationwide manhunt during which he was placed on the list of "America's Most Wanted" fugitives. Investigators found almost $1 million in a storage unit the arrest.
Cody allegedly founded a fake charity -- the U.S. Navy Veterans Association -- through which he collected nearly $2 million from donors in 41 states in a telemarketing scam between 2005 and 2010, authorities said.
While the government acknowledged a possible connection between Cody and a FBI espionage investigation, no other details have been disclosed.

Supreme Court allows federal stem cell research to continue
By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer
updated 12:28 PM EST, Tue January 8, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Court dismisses appeal that tried to block funding of stem cell research on human embryos
Scientists had sued the National Institutes of Health over the use of embryonic stem cells
Opponents of human embryonic stem cell research cite moral issues
Supporters say federal funding will help research ways to fight a range of illnesses
(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a long-standing appeal from scientists who tried to block funding of stem cell research on human embryos.
The brief order from the justices is a victory for supporters of federally funded testing to combat a range of diseases and illnesses. Federal courts had previously lifted an injunction on continued funding, and this latest high court action probably means the lawsuits will be ultimately dismissed.
The field of embryonic stem cell research has been highly controversial, because in most cases, the research process involves destroying the embryo, typically four or five days old, after removing stem cells.
These cells are blank and can become any cell in the body. Because of the destruction of embryos, most opponents believe this is a moral issue. Supporters of the research point to the potential for saving lives.
Heart stem cells repair muscle damage
Embryonic stem cell breakthrough
Indian clinic's stem cell therapy real?
Legislation passed in 1996 prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in the creation or destruction of human embryos "for research purposes." Private money had been used to gather batches of the developing cells at U.S.-run labs. That congressional ban had been renewed annually.
Stem cells vs. heart attacks
The current administration had broken with the Bush White House and issued rules in 2009 permitting those cells to be reproduced in controlled conditions and for work on them to move forward.
Obama administration officials have been at odds with many members of Congress over whether the National Institutes of Health research causes an embryo's destruction, as prohibited by the Dickey-Wicker Act.
In opposing the lawsuit, the government had argued that an extensive list of research projects outlined by the government health research agency would have to be shelved if the courts blocked further funding.
Some scientists say that embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body.
In 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted an injunction originally issued by a federal judge, who said, at the time, that all embryonic stem cell research at the research agency amounted to the destruction of embryos, in violation of congressional spending laws.
The appeals panel later reversed, concluding the plaintiffs bringing suit "are unlikely to prevail because Dickey-Wicker is ambiguous and the NIH seems reasonably to have concluded" that the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells.
Stem cells help deaf gerbils hear
The White House at the time applauded that ruling.
"While we don't know exactly what stem cell research will yield, scientists believe this research could treat or cure diseases that affect millions of Americans every year," said Stephanie Cutter, a deputy senior advisor to the president. "That's why President Obama has long fought to support responsible stem cell research."
The case began with a lawsuit against the National Institutes of Health by James Sherley and Theresa Deisher, scientists opposed to the use of embryonic stem cells, who worked with a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization, including the nonprofit Christian Medical Association.
Embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research, which do not require embryos. The current case does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells, which is permissible under federal law.
In 2001, when President George Bush first approved federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research, 64 existing stem cell lines that were created before August 9, 2001, qualified for federal funding. But of those, only 21 were usable by scientists. Bush later rescinded the funding.
Under the Obama administration's rules, at least 75 stem cell lines qualify for federal funding, according to the National Institutes of Health.
The NIH has invested more than $500 million in human embryonic stem cell research.
Scientists conducting such research say continued federal funding is necessary, because they would have greater flexibility to work collaboratively within labs, across labs and around the world on the latest treatments and breakthroughs.
Supporters of embryonic stem cell research say their studies have shown promise in treating a range of debilitating conditions, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, cancer and spinal cord injuries.
The case is Sherley v. Sebelius (12-454).

Chavez will not be sworn in on inauguration day
By Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN
updated 11:46 AM EST, Wed January 9, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Officials say Hugo Chavez will not be in Venezuela for inauguration day
Government, opposition differ on what happens next; lawmakers debating issue
Chavez's term automatically renews, the government says
The constitution makes it clear that this is not the case, opponents say
(CNN) -- A political clash over the legitimacy of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's next term loomed as the announcement came that he will be unable to attend his inauguration.
With Chavez unable to be sworn in, a number of constitutional questions have become central: Can the president be sworn in on another day? And who should be in charge in the meantime?
The disagreement hangs a cloud of uncertainty over Venezuela, as political forces disagree on whether Chavez will be a legitimate president or whether someone else should assume power and call for new elections.
Officials on Tuesday confirmed that medical treatment in Cuba will keep Chavez from being sworn in for his new term this week.
Saint-like prayer for Chavez
Venezuela's political uncertainty
Chavez absence sparks succession talk
At the same time, supporters and opponents of Chavez are bracing for a legal battle over whether the inauguration can be postponed.
Chavez: Survivor and Venezuela's long-serving president
A statement from Venezuela's vice president read before lawmakers Tuesday said that the constitution authorizes "at a later date, the swearing-in before the Supreme Court."
"The process of post-surgical recuperation must continue past January 10 of this year, so he will not be able to appear on that date before the National Assembly," the statement said.
The 58-year-old Venezuelan president has been treated for cancer in Cuba for the past month, most recently battling respiratory complications.

A fierce debate
Tuesday's formal announcement sparked a fierce debate in the assembly, intensifying a political battle that has been playing out for weeks in news conferences, on the country's airwaves and in social media posts.
The constitution says Chavez can be sworn in before the Supreme Court, but the wording is not clear about whether that swearing-in must occur Thursday or who should run Venezuela in the meantime.
The president of Venezuela's Supreme Court is scheduled to speak to reporters Wednesday.
Supporters and critics of Chavez both point to the country's constitution but offer wildly different interpretations of what it says.
Opposition lawmakers said in Tuesday's debate that Chavez should be declared temporarily absent from his presidential post to avoid a power vacuum.
They argued that Diosdado Cabello, the head of the National Assembly, should temporarily assume the presidency while Chavez recovers.
But Cabello, a close Chavez ally and member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, said that would be unconstitutional.
"There is no way to interpret (the constitution). It is extremely clear," he said. "Everything else is a wish."
Julio Borges, an opposition lawmaker, said Chavez's supporters were fighting among themselves and putting the country's future in jeopardy.
"You are denying the application of the constitution ... and what is unjust is that the Venezuelan people are paying the price of your internal fight while the (country's) problems are still alive and kicking," he said.
Tuesday's debate became so heated that one member of the opposition accused Chavez's supporters of hurling a copy of the constitution at him.
Supporters of Chavez pumped their fists in the air and gave a standing ovation after passing a resolution affirming that Chavez could remain president and be away from the country for as long as necessary to deal with his illness. The resolution backed the interpretation of the constitution held by Chavez's supporters.
Opposition leader calls for action
Henrique Capriles, the man Chavez defeated at the polls in October, said earlier Tuesday that the Supreme Court must clarify the confusion.
Read more: With Chavez ill, uncertainty reigns in Venezuela
"There is a conflict here," Capriles said. "What is the Supreme Court waiting on?"
As far as the opposition is concerned, Capriles said, the constitution is clear that the president's term ends on January 10 and a new period begins.
If Chavez is unable to be sworn in, it creates a leadership vacuum that must be filled by the National Assembly president, and the possibility of new elections arises, Capriles said.
Cabello has said that he has no intention of assuming power if Chavez is not sworn in.
"When (the opposition) talks about a power vacuum, they are proposing a coup," Cabello said, the state-run AVN news agency reported.
Maduro: 'The popular will is what prevails'
The government says that Chavez's new term begins automatically because he was re-elected and that the inauguration could be held later.
In remarks broadcast on national television Tuesday night, Vice President Nicolas Maduro said the inauguration date "is a formality."
Speaking to Venezuela's military leaders, he said that declaring Chavez temporarily absent from his post "would be crazy because the popular will is what prevails."
Voters have re-elected Chavez, he said, calling on the military to help continue Chavez's revolution.
There is no such automatic continuity of power, Capriles said, arguing that "the only thing that has continuity are the country's problems."
"If the constitution is not followed, or there is a conflict of interpretation, the Supreme Court has to take a position," he said.
Capriles expressed concern about unrest or political crisis in the absence of a decision by the high court.
Chavez has not been seen in public and officials have not released any photographs of him since he arrived in Havana for his fourth cancer operation in early December, fueling speculation that his health is worse than the government is letting on.
Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure. Ernesto Villegas said the president was following a strict treatment regimen for "respiratory insufficiency" caused by the infection.
His condition remained unchanged Monday, the government said in a statement.
"Treatment has been administered permanently and rigorously, and the patient is supporting it," the statement said.

Man pleads guilty to owing $1.2 million in child support
By Julia Talanova, CNN
updated 7:15 PM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Prosecutors say Robert Sand spent more than a decade evading his obligations to pay HHS launched a website to get public's help in finding fugitive "deadbeat parents"
He faces up to four years imprisonment; sentencing is scheduled for May 21
New York (CNN) -- A New York man the federal government dubbed the nation's "Most Wanted Deadbeat Parent" has pleaded guilty to evading $1.2 million in child support payments.
Prosecutors said Thursday that Robert Sand, 50, spent more than a decade evading his obligations to his three children by his two former wives.
He admitted to relocating from New York to Florida and then fleeing the country after arrest warrants in 2000 and 2002 were issued, according to Loretta. E. Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
In November, Sand was arrested while trying to enter the Philippines without proper identification and was deported to Los Angeles, where he was taken into custody by U.S. marshals.
In the past decade, Sand ran a business in Thailand, accumulating fees that eventually totaled more than $1 million in back child support.
In January 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched a website to get the public's help in finding and bringing fugitive "deadbeat parents" to justice. Sand was listed as the No. 1 suspected offender based on the amount he owed.
Authorities say Sand previously had been arrested in Thailand and charged with possession of a false British passport.
In early 2010, a federal warrant was issued for his arrest.
"Today, the defendant has admitted to abandoning his responsibilities to the children he helped bring into this world, and to leaving the country to do so," Lynch said. "Neither court orders nor the familial bond meant anything to him as he fled to avoid his obligations."
Sand faces up to four years imprisonment. Sentencing is scheduled for May 21.
His attorney did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Senators have called for higher defense spending to fund attack on Syria
William Hartung says the costs would be relatively small and no reason to boost budget
He says there's plenty of waste and unnecessary programs in defense budget
Editor's note: William D. Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. Follow him on Twitter: @WilliamHartung (CNN) -- A number of conservative hawks, including Senator John McCain and House Armed Services Committee chair Howard P. "Buck" McKeon, have argued that the costs of military attacks against Syria justify rolling back planned cuts in Pentagon spending.
As reported earlier this week on CNN.com, McCain and his colleague Sen. Lindsey Graham have intimated that support for President Obama's plans for military strikes in Syria hinges on a pledge to protect the Pentagon budget from further reductions. This course of action makes no sense for several reasons.
First, assuming that the limited strikes proposed by President Obama go forward, an independent estimate by former White House budget official Gordon Adams of the Stimson Center put the cost at as little as $100 million. Even if the bombing goes on longer and the cost jumps to ten times this amount ($1 billion), it would be just two-tenths of one per cent of the current Pentagon budget. If they are proposing that the United States go beyond limited strikes to full-scale war, proponents of linking Syria to overall Pentagon spending should say so.
Otherwise, a limited attack on Syria is more than manageable within current or anticipated Pentagon resources. The question would be whether to do it, not whether the Pentagon can afford it.
Second, if Syria is as urgent a national priority as McCain, McKeon and their cohorts claim, there is plenty of waste in the Pentagon budget that could offset the costs of military action. Offsetting war costs in this way would be consistent with the position taken by many conservatives on issues of genuine urgency like Hurricane Sandy, when they called for matching cuts for any money spent on hurricane relief.
CNN Money: Budget implications of Syria strike
How Syria might prepare for U.S. attack
Obama considers 'limited action' in Syria
A limited strike would cost less than the price of an F-35 combat aircraft, which currently costs over $160 million per plane. The F-35 is overpriced, underperforming and unnecessary in light of the most likely challenges to our security in the decades to come. A strike would also cost less than one quarter of the $436 million the Congress is trying to add for M-1 tanks the Pentagon isn't even asking for. And it would be roughly one per cent of the cost of the $10 billion B-61 bomb program, a costly addition to our nuclear arsenal that will undermine our security, not promote it.
Bipartisan analyses of Pentagon waste from groups ranging from R Street and the National Taxpayers Union to the Project on Government Oversight and Taxpayers for Common Sense have identified dozens of additional items that could be cut from the Pentagon budget without undermining our ability to address the most urgent threats we face.
Using Syria as an excuse to hold off on Pentagon cuts would be an endorsement of the tens of billions of dollars in waste that exist in the current Department of Defense budget. And it would postpone a long overdue reshaping of the U.S. military to address a world increasingly dominated by non-traditional threats like cyber-attacks, climate change, epidemics of disease, and the spread of nuclear weapons.
Third, there are serious questions about whether an attack on Syria makes sense in the first place. Adding more violence to a conflict that has claimed over 100,000 lives over the past two years is more likely to fan the flames of war than it is to rein in the Assad regime or increase the chances of a political settlement to the conflict. By this logic, any dollar spent on attacking Syria is one dollar too many.
All of the above should be tempered by the knowledge that any military conflict can spiral out of control and end up costing far more in lives and dollars than originally anticipated. If that happens in Syria it would represent a colossal error in judgment. But if U.S. involvement in Syria escalates into a wider war, the funds to do so can and should be raised at that point, so that the Congress and the public can fully weigh the costs of going down that road.
The Congress and the nation have a week to debate whether the United States should launch a military attack on Syria. But regardless of where one stands on the war, we shouldn't let fuzzy math on the part of advocates of intervention railroad us into spending more on the Pentagon than is necessary to defend the country and its interests.

The Situation Online: Princess Diana's death
A memorial to Diana and Dodi at Harrods department store in London."A Tragic Accident"Nearly 10 years after the car crash that killed Princess Diana, her companion Dodi Al Fayed, and her chauffeur, an official British Police report concludes the crash was an accident. The 832-page report (PDF) counters the many conspiracy theories surrounding Diana's death. In response to the report, Dodi Al Fayed's father -- Mohammed Al Fayed -- posts on his Web site that he "will never accept this cover-up of what really happened."Watch "The Situation Room" at 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM, and 7:00 PM ET for this story and more from our Internet reporters.

The Cafferty File: Saudi warning?
On "The Situation Room" today, we asked viewers the following questions, and here are some of our favorite responses that we didn't get to read on air:What does it mean if Saudi Arabia ends up backing the Sunnis in Iraq?Jack, It's really quite simple: if Saudi Arabia gets involved, so does Iran openly and then Syria and Israel and Turkey and Jordan. Then the U.S would really have an interest in the region - we would have been the catalyst for World War III. This is just like WW II, too many entangling alliances!Wayne, Oakwood Hills, IllinoisIt means that we now know who is really running this country: oil and the Saudis.Lou, Sanford, FloridaIt's amazing. Just when you think it can't get any worse, Pres. Bush says we should send in more troops and countries in the Middle East commit to escalating regional conflicts. Which will destroy the world first, this war or global warming?Rudy, Columbus, OhioIt means we had better get busy with our alternative fuels program and quit just talking about it.Phil, Mesa, ArizonaYou think they are not supporting them right now?Taye, Lexington, KentuckyHow will history judge President Bush?If somehow, unlikely as it looks, the Iraq war has some kind of positive ending, he will be remembered for being a good leader who helped pull us together after 9-11.Dennis, Kokomo, IndianaUnless future history books completely distort the facts, he will be viewed as the least popular, most devious president the U.S. ever had.Patricia, Washington, IllinoisHistory is but a bag of tricks we play on the dead. In short, it really depends who is writing the history of our times some 25, or 30 years from now. It also will reflect what will ultimately happen in the Middle East, North Korea, and our nation. Presently, Bush is following the same pattern of dislike as such presidents as Truman and even Lincoln.John, Poughkeepsie, New YorkHistory will remember Bush as the president who set us back 50 years in diplomacy. Can't wait until the end of his term.Michelle, Yakima, WashingtonHouse Democrats are considering an independent ethics panel. Will it ever happen?An independent ethics panel is an idea whose time has come. Republican and Democratic office holders, especially those in the U.S. Congress, are sorely in need of an ethical transfusion… Are they sincere, or only attempting to defuse public outrage regarding constant unethical behavior by members of the Congress?Al, Fresno, CaliforniaCongress is generally bankrupt in ethics; how can a group of the same regulate anybody? I doubt the Democrats will regulate ethics. Some of their early appointments for committee chairpersons indicate poor decision-making capabilities, but strong politics.Sammy, Pt. Pleasant, West VirginiaA congressional ethics oversight agency won't happen because it isn't constitutional. That's the job of the media. That's your job.WilliamLet me put it this way, Jack. If they don't clean up Congress in the next year or so, then we need to launch a third party for 2008. That may be the only way we'll ever get these idiots in Washington of either party to sit up and pay attention to us.David, Louisville, Kentucky

The Cafferty File: No more pork?
On "The Situation Room" today, we asked viewers the following questions, and here are some of our favorite responses that we didn't get to read on air:Should the 110th Congress make the moratorium on pork projects attached to spending bills permanent?Absolutely. If the Democrats truly mean business and intend on cleaning up Congress, this is a step in the right direction.Mitchell, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaJack, It won't happen, but it should...all earmarks, addendums, additions, riders, contingencies, second thoughts, sows' ears and "oopses" should be eliminated. A bill should be about the topic of that bill and nothing else.Gregg, Buffalo, New YorkWouldn't that eliminate politicians' leverage for receiving bribes and under-the-table "gifts"? You must be joking, Jack.Kristi, Kennesaw, GeorgiaEach bill should be voted on one at a time. No other bills involved and no pork added. Why should anyone have to vote on something that has so many strings attached?Dolores, ArkansasHow long should it take President Bush to figure out what to do in Iraq?As long as he wants. He doesn't care how many people disapprove of the Iraq War, he doesn't care what the polls say. He's going to stay in Iraq come what may because if he pulls out the troops now, he'll leave Iraq in even more chaos than it is now.Jean, Sun City, ArizonaJudging by his policy on Iraq, any more decisions on Iraq from President Bush are not exactly those I would be looking forward to; unless he finally pulls his head out of the sand and gets a dose of realityDayne, Groton, ConnecticutI don't know why he calls himself the "decider." He can't decide when he needs to, and decides erroneously when he does.Linus, Oneonta, New YorkWhat does Congress have to do to get higher marks for ethics and honesty than HMO managers and car salesmen?Members of Congress need to start caring more about health care and auto emissions than they do about power, 'earmarks' and lining their own pockets.Emily, Middletown, New YorkI'm flexible, so how about they start by, oh I don't know...doing their job.Nathan, Scottsdale, ArizonaCongress needs to institute stiff fines and penalties for misbehavior and misconduct. It works in every other workplace. Why should Congress be any different?David, Louisville, KentuckyTo get higher marks than car salesmen, Congress has to stop selling their votes to the highest bidders.JonathanWhat do they have to do? How about representing the middle and lower classes instead of selling their souls to big business and the absurdly wealthy?Mark, Lees Summit, Missouri

The Situation Online: Gore's parties, health emergencies, UCLA hack
Al Gore gives his talk in "An Inconvenient Truth." House party: Gore-styleFormer Vice President Al Gore uses the Internet to organize more than a thousand viewing parties nationwide for his documentary "An Inconvenient Truth".

The Cafferty File: Ruling out impeachment?
On "The Situation Room" today, we asked viewers the following questions, and here are some of our favorite responses that we didn't get to read on air:Is it wrong for the incoming Congress to simply rule out the impeachment of President Bush?If the president has broken the law, it is the constitutional duty of the Congress to investigate and bring charges if necessary.Richard, Evanston, IllinoisI greatly dislike Bush, but I am much more outraged about the values bickering instead of issue solving in this do-nothing Congress. I think the new Congress should, at least for now, put their grudges aside and focus more on the issues their predecessors neglected.Ivan, Lancaster, California Impeachment should be a priority. Bush has got us into such a horrible, unacceptable position in the world and on so many levels it would take me hours to list them all. And to think we have two more years of him is outrageous. He is impeachable. I will help.Lisa, Methuen, MassachusettsImpeachment should not be ruled out because it may be the only way to reveal otherwise secret information regarding President Bush's actions during his presidency. The public does not deserve to be left in the dark.JohnWhat does Senator Barack Obama seem to have that the other potential presidential candidates don't?Obama's widest appeal is that he is a fresh face, someone new. In general, Americans are tired of the same old faces appearing in D.C. Obama, being new to the national scene, has people curious about him and hopeful they will find something new. The test will be whether he can keep this quality over the next two years.Colleen, Newark, New JerseyJack, it's almost what he doesn't have: a closet full of deal-making baggage. He has a fresh face. He really does inspire people to hope. And, Jack, after six years of this administration, we desperately need some hope.Tim, Maui, HawaiiHe seems to have a good deal of common sense. He is religious without being a fanatic. He seems to be smart, thoughtful and wise beyond his years. I think he would unify this country and lead the way to solve health care, Medicare, Social Security, education and equality issues. Equality defined as fairness for the working man vs corporate interests.Jim, Arkport, New YorkWhat does it mean when the incoming Democratic House Intelligence chairman doesn't know the basics about al Qaeda and Hezbollah?Why, pray tell, should he be any different than the rest of Congress when it comes to Intelligence?Stew, Palm Beach, FloridaWhen the incoming Democratic House Intelligence chairman admits he knows little or nothing about al Qaeda and Hezbollah it means business as usual in Washington DC.AJ, LaGrange, IllinoisIt means Democrats are no better at vetting leaders than the Republicans. The ineptitude of our political parties ... staggering. After this last election I changed my voter registration to "no party affiliation." In the future, only qualified politicians get my vote. I might be staying home!Russ, New YorkThat's the problem with democracy. You don't have to be qualified for the job to be given the job.Rick, Toronto
