House rebukes the president on Iraq
Story Highlights• House passes resolution opposing Bush's Iraq policy 246-182 • Seventeen GOP members joined Democrats in supporting the resolution • Pelosi: Resolution "should send a clear and firm message to the president • Rep. Hunter warns Congress against "micromanaging" Iraq war Adjust font size:
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Seventeen Republicans joined Democrats on Friday in passing a two-sentence resolution denouncing President Bush's plan to boost troop levels in Iraq. The resolution passed easily, 246-182.Democratic leaders on Saturday will attempt to bring the same measure to the floor in the Senate. (Full story)Democrats hailed the victory, while outside the chamber, Republican congressional leadership blasted the resolution, calling it the first step toward de-funding the war.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the passage of the non-binding resolution "should send a very clear and firm message to the president of the United States: that the American people spoke in November, that they wanted a new direction in Iraq. This resolution today sets the stage for that new direction," she said. (Watch Speaker Pelosi say the resolution marks a "new direction" in Iraq )"The Congress of the United States knows that if we pass a bill, a law, a binding document, the president can veto that," said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. "What the president cannot veto is the opinion of the Congress of the United States, the judgment of the United States Congress, the advice and counsel of the Congress of the United States. He cannot veto that." (Watch how Congress' action might challenge president's powers )The resolution says that Congress supports the military but disapproves of Bush's plan to send 21,500 additional troops to Iraq. A clear majority of Republicans battled to the end against the resolution."One vision sees no hope for us in Iraq and counsels that we withdraw, just give up," said Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee. "By contrast, the other vision focuses on success."House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio said he was concerned that the "Democrats in the House and Senate intend to tie the president's hands when it comes to the conduct of war in Iraq. That's why we want a vote in the House and Senate that says that we will not, we the United States Congress, will not cut funding for our troops in harm's way." (Watch President Bush talk about funding the war )The Democratic leadership has said it will not cut funds for troops already in Iraq, but Sen. John Murtha, chairman of the committee in charge of the Defense Department's purse strings, has already signaled he may attempt to tie future deployments to legislation requiring the troops be fully equipped and armored before they're allowed to be shipped out.Republicans say that's not necessary."What we have now is a system where you can move personnel very quickly; they marry up with the equipment in places like Kuwait and they move into the battle," said Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. "So our ability to move people quickly and move equipment quickly to the fight to save American lives and American interests will very much be compromised by any of these micromanaging policies."Micromanaging DoD personnel policies and trying to choke off equipment and people for the war-fighting theater is extremely dangerous," Hunter said.The White House acknowledged the resolution's passage, noting in a statement from Press Secretary Tony Snow's office that the president's plan "enjoys the support of the Iraqi government and U.S. military leadership, including Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq, who recently was confirmed to his post by an 81-0 vote in the Senate.""The resolution is nonbinding. Soon, Congress will have the opportunity to show its support for the troops in Iraq by funding the supplemental appropriations request the president has submitted, and which our men and women in combat are counting on," the statement said. "The president believes that the Congress should provide the full funding and flexibility our armed forces need to succeed in their mission to protect our country."Now that the House has completed its debate, the showdown moves to the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has promised to bring up the same resolution Saturday. Reid urged Senate Republicans to drop procedural moves that blocked votes on similar Senate resolutions last week."We demand an up-or-down vote," Reid said Thursday. "The resolution says we support the troops and oppose the escalation of the presence in Iraq. We're determined to give our troops and the American people the debate they deserve."But it was not clear whether Reid and his allies will get the 60 votes needed for the Senate to cut off debate on other matters and bring up the issue. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Republicans will insist on "a measure of fairness" that will allow them to offer alternative resolutions, including one stating the Senate won't cut off money for troops in the field."If we have only one alternative, it will involve a vote on funding the troops," said McConnell. He predicted enough Republicans would stick with him to prevent the House resolution from coming to the floor.On February 5, all but two Republican senators voted to block debate on another non-binding resolution backed by most Democrats and several Republicans that would have expressed the Senate's opposition to deploying additional troops.Republicans said Reid's latest move appears to leave behind that measure, backed by Virginia Republican John Warner, the influential former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and current Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan.Published polls indicate a solid majority of the U.S. public opposes the Bush plan, and Democrats said the November election victories that put them in control of Congress show Americans want to wind down the nearly four-year-old war.

Trial in white supremacist leader's death to start in South Africa
By Nkepile Mabuse, CNN
updated 5:10 AM EDT, Mon October 10, 2011
Eugene Terreblanche gives a press conference in 2004 after being released from prison in Potchefstroom STORY HIGHLIGHTS
White supremacist Eugene Terreblanche was bludgeoned and stabbed at his farm He is believed to have died over a wage dispute He was convicted of a 1996 attempted murder Johannesburg (CNN) -- The trial of two men accused of killing white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche is expected to start in the South African town of Ventersdorp on Monday.
Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB), was killed in April following an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm.
Police have charged Chris Mahlangu, 29, and a 16-year-old in the death.
The trial was initially scheduled for December but was postponed several times as lawyers for the defendants changed.
Terreblanche, 69, was bludgeoned with clubs and stabbed with a machete during the attack at his farm near Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West province, police said.
The AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. The group used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections.
Terreblanche was convicted of a 1996 attempted murder of a black man who worked as a security guard on his farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence.

N.Y. governor proposes decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana By Chris Boyette, CNN
updated 6:55 AM EDT, Tue June 5, 2012
Under current New York laws, possessing a small amount of marijuana in public view is a Class B misdemeanor.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A 1977 law makes private possession of 25 grams or less a non-criminal violation
But if the marijuana is publicly visible, the same amount is a Class B misdemeanor
Cuomo is asking that small amounts even in public view be decriminalized
Selling and smoking or burning marijuana would still be a crime
New York (CNN) -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking state legislators to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that are in public view.
Saying the aim was to avoid unnecessary misdemeanor charges against thousands of New Yorkers -- "disproportionately black and Hispanic youth," according to a statement from the governor's office -- the legislation "brings consistency and fairness" to New York's marijuana laws.
"There is a blatant inconsistency. If you possess marijuana privately it is a violation, if you show it in public it's a crime. It's incongruous. It's inconsistent the way it has been enforced," Cuomo told reporters at a press conference in Albany on Monday.
In 1977, New York's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $100 for first-time offenders -- as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view.
New York decriminalizing marijuana?
Numbers behind legalizing pot
RidicuList: 911 marijuana 'emergencies'
If the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a so-called police "stop and frisk" -- it becomes a Class B misdemeanor.
Selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime, and Cuomo is not suggesting changing that.
"The statute as currently written unnecessarily subjects tens of thousands of people to criminal arrest and prosecution for very small quantities of marijuana," said New York State Assembly member Hakeem Jeffries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who have been arrested as a result of the way that the statute is currently written come from the black and Latino community," Jeffries said, adding that statistics and studies show that marijuana possession and use "is far more racially diverse."
According to data released by the governor's office, 2,000 arrests for small amounts of marijuana were made in 1990. In 2011, over 50,000 arrests were made. Fifty percent of those arrested were under 25 years old, and 82% were black or Latino. Less than 10% were ever convicted of a crime.
"The human costs to each defendant charged with a misdemeanor are serious," said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., supporting Cuomo's proposal. "The simple and fair change proposed by Gov. Cuomo will help us redirect significant resources to the most violent criminals and serious crime problems, and, frankly, it is the right thing to do."
According to the governor's office, 94% of arrests for small amounts of marijuana in the state are in New York City, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the New York Police Department and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have come under fire in recent years for the department's much-criticized "stop and frisk" policy.
Bloomberg wants to ban large sodas
"Overly punitive charges have a harmful effect on our justice system. They can ruin lives, waste taxpayer money on unneeded trials, and breed distrust between communities and law enforcement," said Gabriel Sayegh, New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance.
Last year Kelly issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations, rather than misdemeanors, for small amounts of marijuana discovered during street searches, and Monday, Bloomberg issued a statement in support of Cuomo's comments.
"The governor's proposal today is consistent with the commissioner's directive, and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the NYPD will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety -- including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana," he said. "Thanks to the NYPD, our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions."
At the press conference Monday, Kelly said, "I was asked to respond to criticism by some members of the (City) Council that the Police Department was making, quote, 'too many' arrests for small amounts of marijuana. And my response to them, was, 'Well, your option is to go to Albany and get the law changed' -- better that than having New York City police officers turn a blind eye to the law as it was written, and as it is still written."

Obama finds support among Chavez faithful in Caracas
By Girish Gupta, Special to CNN
updated 7:53 AM EDT, Wed October 24, 2012
Barack Obama received a somewhat surprising endorsement in early October when Hugo Chavez called said, "I'd vote for Obama." In 2009, Chavez shook hands with the president and gave him the book "Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent" during a summit.
The two countries have had a contentious relationship for years, but in 2012 they have something in common -- a general election. Chavez recently won a third consecutive term as president of Venezuela. Here, supporters celebrate after receiving news of his victory in Caracas on October 7.
Journalist Girish Gupta says Venezuela is still recovering from the hangover of the brutal campaign between Hugo Chavez (pictured in a Caracas mural) and opposition challenger Henrique Capriles.
Gupta says Chavez welcomed his opponent to the ring in February by calling him a "low-life pig" who would be "pulverized" -- and there were no debates in Venezuela as Chavez felt Capriles was below him. Here, a poster of Capriles is defaced by Chavez supporters. Gupta says some Venezuelans are alarmed by Romney's anti-Venezuela rhetoric. The Republican hopeful branded the Chavez government a "threat to national security" earlier this year, adding that Chavez had spread "dictatorships and tyranny throughout Latin America."
Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, has said their administration would be "tough on Chavez," a message that resonates with Venezuela's hard-line opposition to the president that has helmed the country since 1999. Despite Chavez's recent endorsement of Obama, not everyone approves of the job Washington is doing. Here, protesters hold a poster reading "killers of Libyan people" with portraits of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Caracas, Venezuela, on April 13, 2011.
The lubricant between Caracas and Washington is the world's highest oil reserves, says Gupta, which Chavez is sitting on. Some analysts believe Obama is more willing to tolerate the higher gas prices Venezuela needs in order to keep its oil-dependent economy from collapsing.
The nadir of recent U.S.-Venezuela relations came in 2006, when Chavez called then-president George W. Bush "the devil" at the United Nations General Assembly.
But after years of shaky relations, Chavez appears prepared to start again, saying: "With the likely triumph of Obama, and the extreme right defeated both here and there [in the U.S.], I hope we can start a new period of normal relations."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama, calling him a 'good guy'
Venezuela-U.S. relations have been rocky for more than a decade
Romney's harder stance on Chavez appeals to Venezuelan opposition
America remains Venezuela's biggest oil market
Editor's note: Girish Gupta is a British freelance journalist based in Caracas, Venezuela. His work has appeared in TIME, Reuters, BBC and many other news outlets.
Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Standing in his food shack under posters of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in a Caracas slum, 70-year-old Miguel Bigello relays his backhanded support for Barack Obama.
"For all the deaths he's caused, he's not touched Latin America," he said. "The other guy [Mitt Romney] is too radical. He will fight here for the oil."
The elderly man is an avid supporter of Chavez, his "Comandante," and in the small wooden hut sits a carving of the face of Che Guevara as well as a poster depicting Latin American independence hero Símon Bolívar.

Postcard: Why 'Obamagic' has worn off in Nigeria
Bigello shares the view of his president. "If I was from the U.S., I'd vote for Obama," Chavez said buoyantly on state television just a week before he won his third six-year term two weeks ago, potentially extending his tenure to two decades. "Obama is a good guy."
Venezuela is still hungover from its own presidential election and in this fervently political country — mostly thanks to Chavez's ubiquity, strength of personality and polarizing policies — the U.S. election campaign offers some light relief after a trying few months.
Map: The world weighs in on the U.S. election
The contest between Chavez and Henrique Capriles, the Venezuelan opposition's first real hope in 14 years, made the Romney-Obama matchup look like child's play. Chavez welcomed his opponent to the ring in February by calling him a "low-life pig" who would be "pulverized." There were no debates here as Chavez felt Capriles was below him. "The eagle does not chase flies," said a defiant Chavez.
Postcard: Why Berliners, U.S. are kindred spirits
The self-styled socialist leader's supporters see Obama taking a leaf out of Chavez's book. "Obama is working for the people just like Chavez," said Gomez Darwin, 42, stood under a huge Che Guevara mural in a primarily Chavez-supporting Caracas barrio.
However, it is the contenders' world views which really matter here. Gloria Torres helped organize prayer vigils for Chavez as he suffered cancer last year. "Obama's policies towards Latin America haven't been aggressive," she said, offering her support for the U.S. incumbent before adding: "The other guy doesn't seem to have any friendly intentions towards us!"
Venezuela has come up a number of times in Republican rhetoric during the U.S. race. Mitt Romney branded the Venezuelan government a "threat to national security" earlier this year, adding that Chavez had spread "dictatorships and tyranny throughout Latin America."
Postcard: Obama's 'hope' a mirage for hostile Pakistanis
Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, added: "In a Mitt Romney administration, we will not keep practicing this policy of appeasement ... We will be tough on [Cuban President Raúl] Castro, tough on Chavez. It's because we know that's the right policy for our country."
This antagonism from the Romney camp towards Chavez — compared to Obama's softer approach — has attracted some of Venezuela's more wealthy hard-line opposition.
"Romney named Chavez in his manifesto; Obama didn't," said Aixa Armas, eating breakfast at one of Caracas' high-end hotels. "Obama has closed his eyes to the problem, a regional problem, and he is too friendly with Chavez."
Postcard: War-scarred Baghdad has little faith in election
The lubricant between Caracas and Washington is the world's highest oil reserves on which Chavez sits. It is that wealth that has kept Venezuela's economy from collapsing -- despite epic mismanagement which has led to the region's highest inflation rate and a severe shortage of U.S. dollars. America is Venezuela's biggest oil market and the Latin American country is among the top five exporters to the U.S..
"The U.S. remains the only actual customer paying cash and at full-price," said Russ Dallen, head trader at Caracas' BBO Financial Services. "Romney may want to use that leverage to stop subsidizing a thorn in America's side."
Dallen adds that Venezuela, or at least the Chavez government, needs oil prices to stay high, and Obama may be a safer bet for that. "Obama is more willing to tolerate high gasoline prices because gas at $4 a gallon makes people more willing to invest in alternative technologies and for those technologies to be more cost effective."
Postcard: Obama, Romney ignore Afghans at own peril
Chavez is unlikely to be thinking in such depth. His support for Obama recently marks the apex of the 58-year-old strongman's relations with Washington since coming to power in 1999. The infamous nadir came in 2006 when Chavez stood at the United Nations lectern, theatrically sniffing the air. "The devil came here yesterday," he said, a day after former President George W Bush's speech. "It smells of sulfur still." He then went onto describe Bush's "domination, exploitation, and pillage of the peoples of the world."
Chavez quipped two weeks ago that Obama would support him too, had he been born in Venezuela's slums. After some shaky relations, Chavez is prepared to start again. "With the likely triumph of Obama, and the extreme right defeated both here and there [in the U.S.], I hope we can start a new period of normal relations."

Canker sore drug helps mice lose weight without diet, exercise
By William Hudson and Elizabeth Cohen,CNN updated 5:28 AM EST, Mon February 11, 2013
Doctors will begin testing amlexanox in humans later this year.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Study: Obese mice given a canker sore drug lost weight without cutting calories, moving more
Doctors will begin testing the drug, amlexanox, in humans later this year
If the drugs works, it could be like Viagra, which originally was meant to treat chest pain
(CNN) -- A relatively obscure drug used to treat mouth sores has made obese mice thin -- and the mice didn't have to eat less or exercise more, according to a study at the University of Michigan.
Doctors at the university will begin studies in human beings later this year. Hopes are high, even though many drugs that work in mice do not work in humans.
"It is a tour de force and offers a new and potentially exciting opening for developments of new anti-obesity drugs -- something which is badly needed," says Dr. George Bray, chief of the Division of Clinical Obesity and Metabolism at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University.
In the study at the University of Michigan, researchers gave mice a high-fat diet, and they became obese. They then injected the animals with a drug called amlexanox, which has been on the market for more than 15 years to treat canker sores. The mice lost weight, even though they kept eating the same number of calories. When they were taken off the drug, the mice gained all the weight back.
If amlexanox works in humans -- and that's a big if -- Bray said it could become like the story of Viagra, which was originally developed to treat one condition, chest pain, but serendipitously was later found to treat a different condition, erectile dysfunction.

Debunking diet myths
"It could well be that what works for one disease will turn out to work for another, even though that wasn't the original intent," he said.
The researchers screened several drugs and found that amlexanox, used in an ointment to treat canker sores, changed the action of genes that control metabolism. When injected in mice, the drug worked by increasing metabolism, not by suppressing appetite.
"One of the reasons that diets are so ineffective in producing weight loss for some people is that their bodies adjust to the reduced calories by also reducing their metabolism, so that they are 'defending' their body weight," says Dr. Alan Saltiel, the lead researcher at the University of Michigan. "Amlexanox seems to tweak the metabolic response to excessive calorie storage in mice."
The findings were published Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine.
Clinical trials are expected to begin later this year to test the drug's effectiveness in humans.
In the mouse study, the researchers took pains to make sure that it was the drug, and not something else, that was making the mice lose weight. They used a laser machine to trace the mice to see if perhaps the weight loss was because they moved around more while on the drug.
"They don't move more. The movement is exactly the same. The increased energy expenditure was due to something called thermogenesis, meaning they generate a little bit of heat," Saltiel said.
If the drug helps humans lose weight, researchers would have to make sure it's safe.
"One concern will be whether these drugs, by increasing energy expenditure and body temperature, may have unintended consequences on other systems, such as the heart."
Experts say that's an especially important concern because if the drug is ever used in humans for weight loss, patients would likely need to stay on the drug indefinitely, or else see the weight return.

China newspaper makes bold front-page plea for journalist's release By Katie Hunt, CNN
updated 4:55 AM EDT, Thu October 24, 2013
China's New Express newspaper made a bold front-page plea for the release of one of its reporters.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Chinese paper New Express calls for journalist's release
Chen Yongzhou was arrested for damaging a business' reputation
He wrote series of articles alleging false sales at a construction equipment maker
Chinese newspapers rarely challenge authorities
Hong Kong (CNN) -- "Please set him free" read the plea in stark black print on the front page of the New Express newspaper based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.
In a bold move, the paper openly defied Chinese authorities this week by asking for the release of one its reporters, who has been detained by police in Hunan province.
The move garnered sympathy online and China's media regulator vowed to protect "lawful reporting rights," according to the state-run China Press and Publishing Media group.
Chen Yongzhou was arrested on Saturday, police in the provincial capital Changsha said, months after the newspaper ran stories by Chen that claimed that a Hunan-based company Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology falsified sales numbers.
The state-run company, which did not respond to a call for comment, makes construction equipment.

Reports: China censored newspaper
The police said he had been arrested for damaging a business' commercial reputation, without giving further details. A police spokesman in Changsha contacted by CNN declined to comment.
In May, Zoomlion temporarily suspended trading in its Hong Kong-listed shares to address allegations made in one of Chen's articles. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, it said that all allegations relating to fictitious sales were "false, groundless and misleading."
The paper said on Wednesday that it had verified all of Chen's stories about Zoomlion and only found one discrepancy: He wrote the company spent 513 million yuan on advertisements, when that money had been spent on "advertisements and entertainment."
"If Brother Policeman can find any evidence of shabby reporting on our part, please make notice of it and we will gladly doff our hat," the newspaper said according to a translation published by the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project.
"Because we still believe that — some day, at least — you will have the same full respect for the law that we have."
Open resistance by Chinese media against intimidation by authorities is rare but not unprecedented.
In January this year, crowds gathered in Guangzhou in support of a protest by journalists against alleged government censorship. Journalists at the Southern Weekly paper claimed that an editorial calling for political reform was rewritten by censors as a tribute to Chinese Communist Party rule.

The New Express released a statement from Chen's wife, who said that Chen was taken from his home in a black Mercedes Benz with Hunan license plates. "My... life stopped at the moment," she said.
On social media site Weibo, Chen's colleagues described him as a talented and hardworking business reporter, who ate instant noodles and couldn't afford to take his wife to Pizza Hut.
"We are very grateful that the society has given a lot of attention on this," a spokesperson for the New Express newsroom told CNN.

Phantom pain
Filed under: Pain Management
Phantom pain is pain that feels like it's coming from a body part that's no longer there. Doctors once believed this post-amputation phenomenon was a psychological problem, but experts now recognize that these real sensations originate in the spinal cord and brain. Although phantom pain occurs most often in people who've had an arm or leg removed, the disorder may also occur after surgeries to remove other body parts, such as the breast, penis, eye or tongue. For some people, phantom pain gets better over time without treatment. For others, managing phantom pain can be challenging. You and your doctor can work together to treat phantom pain effectively with medication or other therapies. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Symptoms
Most people who've had a limb removed report that it sometimes feels as if their amputated limb is still there. This painless phenomenon, known as phantom limb sensation, can also occur in people who were born without limbs. Phantom limb sensations may include feelings of coldness, warmth or itchiness or tingling — but should not be confused with phantom pain. Similarly, pain from the remaining stump of an amputated limb is not phantom pain. By definition, phantom pain feels as if it comes from a body part that no longer remains. Characteristics of phantom pain include: Onset within the first few days of amputation
Tendency to come and go rather than be constant
Usually affects the part of the limb farthest from the body, such as the foot of an amputated leg
May be described as shooting, stabbing, boring, squeezing, throbbing or burning
Sometimes feels as if the phantom part is forced into an uncomfortable position
May be triggered by weather changes, pressure on the remaining part of the limb or emotional stress

Causes
The exact cause of phantom pain is unclear, but it appears to originate in the spinal cord and brain. During imaging scans — such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) — portions of the brain that had been neurologically connected to the nerves of the amputated limb show activity when the person feels phantom pain. Many experts believe phantom pain may be at least partially explained as a response to mixed signals from the brain. After an amputation, areas of the spinal cord and brain lose input from the missing limb and adjust to this detachment in unpredictable ways. The result can trigger the body's most basic message that something is not right: pain. Studies also show that, after an amputation, the brain may remap that part of the body's sensory circuitry to another part of the body. In other words, because the amputated area is no longer able to receive sensory information, the information is referred elsewhere — from a missing hand to a still-present cheek, for example. So when the cheek is touched, it's as though the missing hand also is being touched. Because this is yet another version of tangled sensory wires, the result can be pain. A number of other factors are believed to contribute to phantom pain, including damaged nerve endings, scar tissue at the site of the amputation and the physical memory of pre-amputation pain in the affected area. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Risk factors
It's still unknown why some people develop phantom pain after an amputation while others do not. Some factors that may increase your risk of phantom pain include:
Pain before amputation. Some researchers have found that people who had pain in a limb before amputation are likely to have it afterward, especially immediately after amputation. This may be because the brain holds on to the memory of the pain and keeps sending pain signals, even after the limb is removed.
Stump pain. People who have persistent stump pain usually have phantom pain, too. Stump pain can be caused by an abnormal growth on damaged nerve endings (neuroma) that often results in painful nerve activity.
Poor-fitting artificial limb (prosthesis). Talk to your doctor to be sure you're putting your artificial limb on correctly and that it fits properly. If you think your artificial limb may not fit properly, or is causing pain, talk to your doctor.

Preparing for your appointment
Because phantom sensation and phantom pain are common after an amputation, it's likely your doctor will ask you about these symptoms during follow-up visits after your surgery. If you develop pain from the amputated limb before your doctor raises the issue, call your doctor. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and on your response to initial treatments, your doctor may refer you to a specialized pain center. What you can do Write down your symptoms, including when you first noticed them and how often they occur. Also note whether anything in particular seems to trigger phantom pain.
Make a list of your key medical information, including any other conditions with which you've been diagnosed and the names of any medications, vitamins and supplements you're taking.
Take a family member or friend along, if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to recall all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
Write down questions to ask your doctor. Creating your list of questions in advance can help you make the most of your time with your doctor.
For phantom pain, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: What pain relief therapies do you recommend? If you're prescribing medications, what are the possible side effects?
Is there any risk of becoming dependent on or addicted to these drugs?
Given that I have these other health conditions, how can I best manage them together?
Are the treatments you're suggesting likely to be covered by insurance?

Tests and diagnosis
Although there's no medical test to diagnose phantom pain, doctors can identify the condition by collecting information about your symptoms and the circumstances (such as trauma or surgery) that occurred before the pain started. Describing your pain precisely can help your doctor pinpoint your problem. Even though it's common to have phantom pain and stump pain at the same time, treatments for these two problems may differ. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Treatments and drugs
Finding a treatment to relieve your phantom pain can be difficult. Doctors usually begin with medications and then may add noninvasive therapies, such as acupuncture or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). More-invasive options include injections or implanted devices. Surgery is done only as a last resort. Medications
Although no medications specifically for phantom pain exist, some drugs designed to treat other conditions have been helpful in relieving nerve pain. No single drug works for everyone, and not everyone benefits from medications. You may need to try different medications to find one that works for you. Medications used in the treatment of phantom pain include:
Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants often can relieve the pain caused by damaged nerves. Examples include amitriptyline and nortriptyline (Pamelor). These drugs work by modifying chemical messengers that relay pain signals. Antidepressants may also help you sleep, which can make you feel better. Possible side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, weight gain, and a decrease in sexual performance or desire.
Anticonvulsants. Epilepsy drugs — such as gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol) — are often used to treat nerve pain. They work by quieting damaged nerves to slow or prevent uncontrolled pain signals. Side effects may include depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, irritability, and allergic reactions such as hives, fever and swelling.
Narcotics. Opioid medications, such as codeine and morphine, may be an option for some people. Taken in appropriate doses under your doctor's direction, they may help control phantom pain. However, you may not be able to take them if you have a history of substance abuse. Even if you don't have a history of substance abuse, these drugs can cause many side effects, including constipation, nausea, vomiting or sedation.
Noninvasive therapies
As with medications, treating phantom pain with noninvasive therapies is a matter of trial and observation. The following techniques may relieve phantom pain:
Nerve stimulation. In a procedure called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a device sends a weak electrical current via adhesive patches on the skin near the area of pain. This may interrupt or mask pain signals, preventing them from reaching your brain. Used properly, TENS is safe. To avoid an unintentional shock, don't wear a TENS device in the shower or tub or turn it up too high.
Electric artificial limb. A type of artificial limb called a myoelectric prosthesis has motors controlled by electrical signals that occur during voluntary muscle activation in the remaining limb. Using a myoelectric prosthesis may reduce phantom pain.
Mirror box. This device contains mirrors that make it look like an amputated limb exists. The mirror box has two openings — one for the intact limb and one for the stump. The person then performs symmetrical exercises, while watching the intact limb move and imagining that he or she is actually observing the missing limb moving. Studies have found that this exercise helps relieve phantom pain in a significant number of people.
Acupuncture. The National Institutes of Health has found that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for some types of chronic pain. In acupuncture, the practitioner inserts extremely fine, sterilized stainless steel needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It's thought that acupuncture stimulates your central nervous system to release the body's natural pain-relieving endorphins. Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed correctly.
Minimally invasive therapies Injection. Sometimes injecting pain-killing medications — local anesthetics, steroids or both — into the stump can provide relief of phantom limb pain.
Spinal cord stimulation. Your doctor inserts tiny electrodes along your spinal cord. A small electrical current delivered to the spinal cord can sometimes relieve pain.
Intrathecal delivery system. This procedure allows medication to be delivered directly into the spinal fluid. Much lower doses of medication are needed with this route of delivery. It can be useful for people who experience pain relief with oral medications, but who can't tolerate the side effects.
Surgery
Surgery may be an option if other treatments haven't helped. Surgical options include: Brain stimulation. Deep brain stimulation and motor cortex stimulation are similar to spinal cord stimulation except that the current is delivered within the brain. A surgeon uses a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to position the electrodes correctly. Although the data are still limited, brain stimulation appears to be a promising option in selected individuals.
Stump revision or neurectomy. If phantom pain is triggered by nerve irritation in the stump, surgical resection or revision can sometimes be helpful. But cutting nerves also carries the risk of making the pain worse.
On the horizon
Newer approaches to relieve phantom pain include virtual reality goggles. The computer program for the goggles mirrors the person's intact limb, so it looks like there's been no amputation. The person then moves his or her virtual limb around to accomplish various tasks, such as batting away a ball hanging in midair. Although this technique has been tested on only a few people, it appears to help relieve phantom pain.

Lifestyle and home remedies
You may not have control over whether you develop phantom pain after surgery, but you can reduce your discomfort and improve your quality of life. One or more of these approaches may help you get through a flare-up of phantom pain: Look for distractions. Find activities that take your focus off the pain, such as reading or listening to music.
Stay physically active. Get your exercise by doing activities that you enjoy, such as gardening, walking, swimming or cycling.
Take your medications. Follow your doctor's directions in taking prescribed and over-the-counter pain medications. If you try herbal and other alternative medications, be sure to tell your doctor.
Find ways to relax. Practice activities that reduce your emotional and muscular tension. Take a warm bath — not too hot, as heat may aggravate the pain. Lie down and follow helpful relaxation techniques, such as rhythmic breathing, meditation or visualization.
Seek the support of other people. Find ways to get closer to others. Call friends, or join a support group or a group involved in your favorite hobby.
Take care of your stump. Removing or putting on your prosthesis, massaging the stump, and applying TENS, cold or heat may reduce the pain.
Remember that managing phantom pain can make a big difference in how you feel. If one approach doesn't provide relief, try something else rather than give up. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Coping and support
Learning to live without a limb, especially if you have phantom pain, can be challenging. Depression often accompanies pain. You may find it helpful to talk to a counselor or therapist. Or, an in-person or online support group can put you in touch with others who know what you're going through. To find support, ask your doctor for a referral, either to a counselor or to a support group. You also can contact the Amputee Coalition at www.amputee-coalition.org for information on its National Peer Network, which can put you in touch with a variety of support services, including its Peer Visitor Program. This program can connect you with someone who's been in your place and can talk to you about healing, share his or her experiences and offer advice. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Prevention
Because the risk of developing phantom pain is higher for people who have experienced pain in the limb before amputation, some doctors recommend regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural) in the few hours or days leading up to amputation. This may reduce pain immediately following surgery and reduce the risk of lasting phantom limb pain.
Two drugs have shown promise in preventing phantom pain:
Calcitonin (Miacalcin). Researchers aren't sure why calcitonin — a hormone produced by the body that slows the rate at which your body breaks down bone — provides pain relief. You may receive this drug directly into a vein (intravenously) during the week after amputation. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting and allergic reactions, including rashes, abdominal pain and swelling.
Ketamine (Ketalar). This anesthetic drug is sometimes given after surgery to help prevent phantom pain. Its side effects can include sedation, hallucinations and delirium.
