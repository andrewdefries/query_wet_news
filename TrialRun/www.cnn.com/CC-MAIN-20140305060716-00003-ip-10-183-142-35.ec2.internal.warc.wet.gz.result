WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Vice President Al Gore accused the Bush administration Thursday of misleading the American people by claiming a strong connection between Saddam Hussein and the terror group al Qaeda."Beginning very soon after the attacks of 9/11, President Bush made a decision to start mentioning Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein in the same breath in a cynical mantra designed to fuse them together as one in the public's mind," Gore said.Bush and Cheney created a false impression in the minds of American people that the former Iraqi leader and al Qaeda, blamed for the Sept. 11 terror attacks, were working together, Gore said at the Georgetown University Law School.His speech Thursday was the latest in a series he has given that harshly criticize the Bush administration.Bush played on this impression in arguing the need for waging war on Iraq, the Democrat said.This month, the independent commission investigating the September 11, 2001, attacks said it found "no credible evidence" of an Iraq-al Qaeda connection beyond preliminary meetings that led nowhere. But neither Bush nor Cheney have wavered from their earlier statements."They dare not admit the truth lest they look like complete fools for launching our country into a reckless, discretionary war against a nation that posed no immediate threat to us whatsoever," Gore charged.GOP responseThe Republican National Committee dismissed Gore's criticism."Al Gore's history of denial of the threat of terrorism is no less dangerous today in his role as John Kerry's surrogate than it was in the 1990s in his role as vice president, a time when Osama Bin Laden was declaring war on the United States five different times," RNC Communications Director Jim Dyke said in a written statement.Gore said media who challenge Bush and Cheney's claims of a link are intimidated by the administration."The administration works closely with a network of rapid-response digital Brown Shirts who work to pressure reporters and their editors for undermining support for our troops," Gore said. The term "Brown Shirts" refers to Nazi supporters in the 1930s and '40s."The Bush administration's objective of establishing U.S. domination over any potential adversary led to the hubristic, tragic miscalculation of the Iraq war, a painful adventure marked by one disaster after another based on one mistaken assumption after another."But the people who paid the price have been the U.S. soldiers trapped over there and the Iraqis in prison," Gore said, referring to the prisoner-abuse scandal.And Gore said administration lawyers have provided a legal rationale for what he called "sadistic activities" at the prisons -- even though the administration has said it is committed to the humane treatment of all prisoners.In essence, Gore charged, the lawyers found that the president -- whenever he is acting as commander-in-chief -- is above the "rule of law."Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Court decision on gun control is personal for 2 women Story Highlights The nation's capital does not allow its residents to possess handguns Supreme Court to consider if Washington's handgun ban violates individual rights Shelly Parker, a single woman in D.C., says she has no defense against intruders Virginia Tech survivor worries guns are too easy to get Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO From Bill Mears CNN	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Shelly Parker wants to know why she cannot keep a handgun in her house. As a single woman she has been threatened by neighborhood drug dealers in a city where violent crime rates are on the rise. "In the event that someone does get in my home, I would have no defense, except maybe throw my paper towels at them," she said. But Parker lives in the nation's capital, which does not allow its residents to possess handguns. Elilta "Lily" Habtu thinks that is how it should be. She knows about gun violence firsthand, surviving bullets to the head and arm fired by the Virginia Tech University shooter nearly a year ago. "There has to be tighter gun control; we can't let another Virginia Tech to happen," she said. "And we're just not doing it, we're sitting around, we're doing nothing. We let the opportunity arise for more massacres." On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will consider whether Washington's sweeping ban on handgun ownership violates an individual's constitutional right to "keep and bear arms," setting the stage for a potentially monumental legal and social battle, just in time for the 2008 elections. The issue is one that has polarized judges and politicians for decades: Do the Second Amendment's 27 words bestow gun ownership as an individual right, or is it a collective one -- aimed at the civic responsibilities of state militias, and therefore subject, perhaps, to strict government regulation? "What the Supreme Court says will really set the terms of the debate on gun control for years to come," said Orin Kerr, an expert on criminal procedure at George Washington Law School. "So everyone's waiting to find out what the justices will do." Don't Miss Oklahoma may allow college students to carry guns
Where the candidates stand on guns
The Supreme Court has generally steered clear of settling the individual-versus-collective argument. It last examined the issue in 1939 without fully delving into the broader constitutional questions. Similar weapon-control laws could be in jeopardy, and jurisdictions such as the states of Maryland and Massachusetts and the cities of Chicago, Illinois, and San Francisco, California, filed briefs supporting the District of Columbia. Thirty-one states along with groups like the National Rifle Association support the gun owners. But both sides have privately expressed concern over how the justices will decide the issue, because the legal and political implications could be sweeping in scope. After a federal appeals court in March ruled the handgun ban to be unconstitutional, city leaders urged the high court to intervene, saying refusal to do so could prove dire. Several Washington citizens, including Parker, challenged the law, some saying they wanted to do something about being constant victims of crime. Watch women debate gun control law » She said her community activism earned her the anger of local drug dealers, who vandalized her property and made repeated verbal threats and taunts. After her car window was broken, she called police, who offered some friendly advice. "I said to the police, 'I have an alarm, I have bars, I have a dog, what more am I supposed to do?" recalled Parker. "The police turned to me and said, 'Get a gun.' " Habtu, a 23-year-old Eritrean-born woman, was in a Norris Hall classroom in April when fellow Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho burst in and began shooting. He eventually killed 32 people and wounded dozens more before taking his own life. It was the nation's deadliest school shooting. "That was one of the worst days of my life. I was injured, I had one gunshot wound in my jaw, and the bullet is still lodged one millimeter away from my brain stem," she said. Since graduating, Habtu has devoted her time to speaking in favor of gun control, including tightening laws on Internet gun sales, and preventing loopholes that allow mentally ill people like Cho to buy weapons. "No one here is trying to fight against your right to have a gun," she said in a soft voice. "What we want is for dangerous people not to get access to one, and today it is just too easy. We cannot keep sacrificing innocent people because you have a fear that you're not going to have your right to own a gun." A ruling is expected in late June.

Teddy bears, lab goggles, letters remember Virginia Tech victimsStory Highlights Thousands of items sent from around globe are housed on Tech campus Items range from letters from kids to an American flag from Afghanistan "It is really remarkable that so many people cared to reach out to us," survivor says Archivist: "There are a few that I will not ever forget reading" Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO INTERACTIVE From Drew Griffin and Robert Howell CNN BLACKSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- Erin Sheehan was a freshman last year when Seung-Hui Cho peeked through the door of her German class. The next hour of her life would become a struggle for survival. Erin Sheehan played dead while the Virginia Tech shooter went on a rampage. "I still have trouble sleeping." "The gunman entered my room. He shot my German teacher and then proceeded to shoot the students in the classroom pretty thoroughly," she said. Sheehan was only one of four students in the room not to get shot. She jumped on the floor and remained quiet while Cho went on his rampage. "I thought if I played dead then he hopefully would think I was already hit." She listened as the killer left her Norris Hall classroom to attack another room. She and the other survivors barricaded the door to keep Cho from coming back. "I tried to use a podium at the front of the classroom to block the door, because the gunman was shoving at the door and started firing through the door. We didn't think we were going to be able to hold it," she said. Watch Sheehan remember a day of horror » Sheehan is now a sophomore at Virginia Tech. Like so many on campus, April 16, 2007, marks the worst day of her life, when Cho killed 32 students and professors in the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Sheehan recently accompanied CNN to what is known as the Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Prevail Archive -- an office space on the edge of campus where mementoes sent from across the world are temporarily warehoused. The university is cataloging and documenting every item it can save in order to create a permanent collection as well as an online archive that the public can access. Take a tour of the archive » Teddy bears, an American flag from the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan, painted eggs, the hood of a race car, condolence posters signed by Koreans and a letter from President Bush are housed there. Thousands of other letters are also kept in the archive. "This is making me feel super bad. Because a lot of people died at Blacksburg. I love VT," wrote one young child.

A student's view of campus security
Walking through the archive for the first time, Sheehan was overcome with emotion. She stopped and held a picture of all the victims, pointing out her slain German teacher and another classmate. "I believe this is Nicole White, she sat right next to me. And I think I would credit her with taking bullets for me," she said in a muted tone. Watch letters to Virginia Tech » Of the entire archive, she added, "I don't ever remember seeing it all together like this before. I think it is really remarkable that so many people cared to reach out to us like this." Tamara Kennelly is the archivist at Virginia Tech. She's responsible for documenting how everyone beyond the campus dealt with the tragedy, when the world was joined by four words: "We are all Hokies." "People at other places have really identified with us and felt all of this with us," she said. "I think it's very heartening, it's very moving to me." Watch a Tech student describe surviving four shots » They've received just about anything, from condolences books from funeral homes to messages from prisons to letters from elementary students. "There are always people who really have their own story to tell or a powerful way of putting it. And when you find those letters, they stay with you -- all day, all week," said Amy Vilelle, the manuscript archivist. "There are a few that I will not ever forget reading." Some are very personal, like a pair of goggles from a lab partner. "Mike may you rest in peace. You will forever be remembered as my favorite lab partner. We'll be missing you," it says on the goggles. Fighting back tears, Kennelly said, "This job is very moving because you get something and you read it and you think, 'oh gosh, they want to share something with us somehow. They want to reach out and give some kindness.' " Gail McMillan, the director of digital archives, says it's especially difficult to read material from children. "It's hard to know what kind of impact this may have on them." Their job is not only to remember, but to preserve, an archival collection for the university. For those who lived it, the tragic events of April 16, 2007, are still too fresh to put into the past. "I still have trouble sleeping some days," Sheehan said. "It really does bother me because I still understand I could have been killed so easy, and there is no explanation why I wasn't." E-mail to a friend All About School Shootings • Gun Control

Don't get scammed by fake health plansStory Highlights Between 2 and 4 million people have purchased health care discount cards Cards promise discounts at hospitals and doctors' offices Some card companies scam consumers: discounts don't exist FTC, eight states have taken action against health card scams Next Article in Health » By Elizabeth Cohen CNN Senior Medical Correspondent	(CNN) -- Hope Murray thought her prayers had been answered. Hope Murray, left, was desperate to find affordable health care for her daughter Meredith. Her daughter, Meredith, desperately needed to see a doctor after suffering a brain injury in a car accident, but health insurance companies wouldn't sell her a policy because of her pre-existing condition. So Murray was relieved to find Direct Medical Network Solutions Inc. while surfing the Internet. It wasn't insurance but a program that advertised deep discounts at doctors' offices and hospitals. Murray immediately signed up for the program, which she says advertised $30 doctor visits and $50 visits to specialists. "It was pretty phenomenal," Murray said. "They promised me everything was included," including doctor visits, vision, dental and hospital stays. "They even mentioned the Mayo Clinic." Murray paid $314 for the card up front and then $179 each month after that. Her daughter made an appointment to see Dr. Robert Epsten, a San Diego, California, gastroenterologist, to get treatment for her Crohn's disease. Epsten was listed on Direct Med's Web site as being part of its network, but when Meredith arrived at Epsten's office, his staff said they didn't accept the Direct Med card. In fact, they said they'd never even heard of Direct Med, Hope Murray says. According to Murray, this same scene played out with several other doctors and hospitals. "I have never been more angry, more furious about anything in my life," Murray said. "It is a bogus scam that hurts people. It should be a crime for people to do that." Don't Miss In Depth: Empowered Patient
The Federal Trade Commission and at least eight states have taken action against more than two dozen health cards for offering discounts services that don't exist. "Medical discount cards are spreading like kudzu," said Jim Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. "There's a tremendous amount of fraud and deception in these plans because they're not well regulated." "Medical discount cards are awful," said Nancy Metcalf, senior program editor with Consumer Reports. "They're absolute ripoffs. I would stay away from them completely." Two to 4 million people have purchased health care discount cards like the one Murray bought, according to the Consumer Health Alliance, a trade group representing companies that sell the cards. The group acknowledges that there are some dishonest companies out there but says they do not reflect the majority of the industry. On its Web site, Consumer Health Alliance has set up a consumer guide for shopping for a discount health care program. The cards are attractive to people like Murray who don't have health insurance from their jobs and can't buy it on their own. "Members stay in these programs because they see the savings," said Allen Erenbaum, a lawyer for the Consumer Health Alliance. "Discount health care programs aren't the answer to this country's health care crisis, but for people without any access to insurance, saving money with these programs is better than nothing." Hope Murray canceled her daughter's card in March, three months after signing up. Meredith, who recently received a master's degree in rehabilitative counseling, is now looking for a job with health benefits. Don't Miss MayoClinic.com: Crohn's disease
MayoClinic.com: Brain & nervous system
Repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment from Direct Med have gone unanswered. Epsten is still listed on Direct Med's Web site as an in-network doctor, but when CNN called his office, his staff said they didn't accept the card. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners says that although some discount cards are fraudulent, others are legitimate. Here are some tips to know a good company from a bad one. Consumer advocates say you should suspect a scam if: 1. You learn of the discount card from a blast fax or Internet popup ad. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners considers this a red flag that you're about to be scammed. You can read the rest of the warnings on its Web site. 2. They promise a certain percentage savings. "A 30 percent discount means nothing. Thirty percent off of what?" Metcalf asked. 3. They use the term "guaranteed coverage." This makes the card sound like insurance, which it's not, says the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. The coalition also lists other scam alerts on its Web site. 4. They won't give you a list of providers until you sign up. The discount card company should tell you the providers up front. If they won't, hang up the phone. If they do, call the providers and verify that they take the card. 5. It sounds too good to be true. "If you've looked into getting regular insurance and gotten a price, and then you find something way cheaper, that's a huge red flag," Metcalf said. "It's cheaper for a reason."

Nintendo warns against youngsters playing its upcoming 3-D systemBy John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets The Nintendo 3DS may cause problems for kids under the age of 6, the company said on its website. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Nintendo says 3-D video games may cause problems with kids' eyes The warning pertains to the company's upcoming 3DS gaming system The warnings refer specifically to kids younger than 6 (CNN) -- Nintendo is warning young children against playing 3-D video games on its upcoming handheld gaming system, the Nintendo 3DS. Kids age 6 and younger who play the 3-D games may have the growth of their eyes stunted, the company said in a statement on its Japanese website. The warning notes that parents can turn off the 3-D functionality of the handheld 3DS. They can also set passwords that keep kids from using that feature. The statement also asks everyone who plays the 3-D gaming system to take periodic breaks from the games as often as every hour or 30 minutes. The warning follows many others on the potential health effects of three-dimensional entertainment. TV makers have issued warnings about young people, pregnant women and even drunk people viewing 3-D TV, noting that the medium may cause nausea, dizziness and seizures. In one such warning, Samsung said those risks are heightened in kids. Nintendo has largely gotten favorable reviews for the 3DS system, which lets players see games in three dimensions without wearing the clunky glasses that are required for most 3-D television and movie displays. The company debuted the 3DS at a trade show earlier this year. The $300 device is scheduled to hit stores in Japan in February and then in the United States in March.

Secret Service made the right call on Ted Nugent
By Dean Obeidallah, Special to CNN
updated 1:54 PM EDT, Tue April 24, 2012
Musician Ted Nugent, shown at a GOP campaign rally in 2010, was interviewed last week by the Secret Service for his remarks about President Obama. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ted Nugent's remarks at the NRA convention attracted Secret Service attention
Dean Obeidallah says threats against president shouldn't be tolerated
He says Nugent's remarks didn't represent a true threat; free speech is protected
Obeidallah: Allowing open expression is important for freedom, democracy
Editor's note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is a comedian and frequent television commentator. He is the editor of the politics blog "The Dean's Report" and co-director of the upcoming documentary, "The Muslims Are Coming!" Watch him on CNN Saturdays with Don Lemon at 10 p.m. ET. Follow him on Twitter: @deanofcomedy
(CNN) -- Rocker Ted Nugent found himself being investigated by the U.S. Secret Service after making this statement last weekend at the NRA Convention: "If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year."
While I dismissed Nugent's comments as just another idiotic statement by the person known as "The Motor City Madman," others thought Nugent may have violated the federal law that makes it a crime to threaten the president of the United States. CNN contributor LZ Granderson even wrote an article entitled "Ted Nugent should be in jail," calling for the arrest of Nugent. However, Granderson recognized that under the law as it stands, Nugent would not, in fact, be imprisoned for the comment at issue.
Threats against the president of the United States should not be tolerated, regardless of the president's political affiliation.
Dean Obeidallah
But while viscerally I may agree with those calling for Nugent's arrest, they are absolutely and unequivocally wrong. (In full disclosure, I must reveal that I do have Ted Nugent's classic hit "Cat Scratch Fever" in my IPod, but I still feel I can be objective in this matter.)
Nugent should not be prosecuted for two equally important reasons: He did not break the law, and we must be vigilant in protecting freedom of expression when it involves political subject matter.
West: Nugent doesn't have 'ill will'
Sen. Inhofe weighs in on Nugent comments
Ted Nugent: Obama admin 'vile, evil'
From a legal point of view, Nugent's statement did not violate the controlling federal statute which provides that it's a crime to make: "any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States."
To violate this statute, a person must make a "true threat" as defined by the federal courts. However, Nugent's words were ambiguous and did not objectively indicate a threat against the president. There's little doubt Nugent's statement would be considered by the courts as nothing more than "political hyperbole," not a crime.
Furthermore, when considering this federal statute, our courts have been more protective of statements made at a political rally. Nugent's comment was made at a political event -- the NRA convention, which parenthetically I must note was held in St. Louis, the city with the second highest rate of teens being killed by guns.
The Secret Service met with Nugent on Thursday before his concert in Oklahoma, and based on their discussions came to the same conclusion. They did not arrest him and announced the matter was resolved.
After the meeting, Nugent even praised the Secret Service agents with his statement: "God bless the good federal agents wherever they may be." (Although if you think about his statement -- "wherever they may be" - he may have actually been mocking the agents he had just met.)
In any event, Nugent was free to play his concert that night and treat the audience to his greatest hit -- or maybe he has two -- I'm only aware of the one song in my IPod.
Not only was the Secret Service's decision legally sound, it was also absolutely needed to ensure we have open and candid discussion about our elected officials, even when the comments are as asinine as Nugent's.
Our courts have uniformly held that no form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than political speech. The U.S. Supreme Court offered these instructive words in 1969, which courts have been employing ever since: "Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."
While the words Nugent used regrettably contribute to the growing lack of civility in American political discourse, it was still political speech. It is for the good of our democracy that the Ted Nugents of the world -- and I truly hope there is only one -- can make even ugly and caustic statements about the president without fear of imprisonment.
Anything else could lead to a chilling effect on free expression which we cannot and should not allow.
(Editor's note: An earlier version of this article contained a statistic which the Secret Service has denied: a statement that threats against President Obama have jumped 400% from those made against President George W. Bush. The Secret Service said that is not correct.)

Driven by destiny: Zanardi wins the race of his life to take gold
By Sarah Holt, for CNN
updated 10:05 AM EDT, Thu September 6, 2012
Alex Zanardi proudly displays the gold medal he won at the 2012 London Paralympics in the Individual H4 Time Trial.
Before taking up hand cycling, he had previously driven on the same Brands Hatch circuit, 20 miles outside of London, in a touring car.
Zanardi decided to give up his motor racing career three years ago at the age of 42, having continued it despite a life-threatening crash in 2001. Driving a Honda Reynard (No. 66) Zanardi sustained horrific injuries during a CART Championship series race in Germany as he collided with fellow competitor Alexandre Tagliani (No. 33). Zanardi made a successful return to motorsport after his horror crash and raced in single seaters and touring cars, using prosthetic limbs and modified vehicles. Zanardi was honored for his incredible comeback at the Laureus World Sports awards in 2005.
While he struggled in four seasons in Formula One, Zanardi enjoyed success in open-wheel racing as he twice won the U.S. CART series.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ex-Formula One driver Alex Zanardi claims gold medal in hand cycling at the London 2012 Paralympics
He lost both his legs in a horrific crash in 2001 but continued in motorsport
Italian first tried hand cycling in 2007 and made it his new career two years later
The 45-year-old says he has made the most of the chances fate has given him
(CNN) -- "It's been a magical adventure, and this is a fantastic conclusion."
Not many people get second chances in life, but Alex Zanardi is making the most of his.
In 2001 the ex-Formula One driver was at death's door, lucky to survive a horrific accident that left him with only 30% of his blood supply. He lost both his legs -- amputated at the knee -- after being pulled from the wreckage of his car at a race in Germany.
Fast forward more than a decade, to another race track, and the Italian is on top of the world.
While he was never able to reach the heights of success in F1 -- Zanardi never made the podium in 44 races -- he is a champion Paralympian.

Paralympics 2012: The best photos
Tatyana McFadden is an eight-time world champion sprint athlete from the United States. She has previously participated in Paralympic Games in Athens and Beijing. So far in London, she has added a gold to her medal stash. Before the London Paralympics, Jessica Long told usaswimming.com she wanted to have fun while competing this year. This relaxed attitude has worked well for Long who has won three gold medals since arriving in London, which she is adding to her nine previous Paralympics medals. Sarah Storey was a big name for ParalympicsGB before the Games started. She cemeted her name in the Paralympic record books by winning the first gold medal for the host nation and setting a new world record -- all on day one.
Not only is Esther Vergeer the female world number one in wheelchair tennis, but she also holds the remarkable record of 465 unbeaten singles matches over almost a decade. Alexandra Rickham and Niki Birrell of Great Britain got together as a sailing team in 2007 and have gone on to win four consecutive world titles. However, a paralympic medal has so far alluded them. U.S. athlete April Holmes competes in the women's 100m T44 event on day eight of the 2008 Paralympic Games. She beat her own world record, fulfilling an ambition she'd spoken about before the games. Sarai Gascon of Spain competes in the women's 100m Butterfly S9 on day one of the London 2012 Paralympic Games at the Aquatics Centre. She was up against preeminent South African Natalie du Toit. She placed second but with many races to go, the pair's battle is set to continue.
Jess Gallagher is the first and only Australian woman to win a medal at the Paralympic winter games, which she did in Vancouver in 2010. In London, she's aiming for a summer paralympics medal in long jump having come sixth in the javelin.

8 female Paralympians to watch Due to the Paralympics' classification rules, South Africa's double amputee "Blade Runner" Oscar Pistorius can line up against runners with only one prosthetic leg. Chinese swimmer Zheng Tao has no arms, but that didn't stop him winning gold against competitors more physically abled.
Britain's gold medalist Jonathan Fox looked "more able" outside the pool than his swimming rivals, according to former Canadian Paralympic middle-distance runner David Howe, who is now an academic.
Paralympic swimmer Mallory Weggemann, along with U.S. teammate Victoria Arlen, have both battled the International Paralympic Committee after having their classifications changed.
Athletes are placed in one of six main disability groups: those with spinal injuries, cerebral palsy, amputees, the blind or visually impaired, intellectual disabilities and those whose disabilities fall outside of those categories, like those born with dwarfism or multiple sclerosis.
Each of the Paralympics' 20 sports are divided between the different classifications and given a number that denotes the severity of the disability -- 1 being the most severe, 10 the least. The IPC has complicated things further by trying to slim down the number of medals and disciplines and look beyond the disability as the defining factor in classification. Instead, it says, look to the potential of the athlete.

Classifiying Paralympic ability
"I'm somebody very lucky who had a great life," the the 45-year-old Zanardi said after winning gold in his adopted sport of hand cycling at Britain's Brands Hatch circuit on Wednesday.
"I haven't wasted many opportunities that fate gave me. I've certainly had many more opportunities than I deserved, but luckily enough I ended up making the right choices."
From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann
In the buildup to the London Games, Zanardi joked, with a dose of black humor, that his accident "was how I won my ticket to the 2012 Paralympics."
Having failed to make a career in F1 after four difficult seasons, he turned to the U.S. CART series where he twice won the drivers' title for Chip Ganassi's team.
That earned him a return to the elite division of motorsport in 1999 with the Williams team, but again he struggled.
Drifting back to open-wheel cars, fate came calling at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz on September 15, 2001. He had worked his way up from the rear of the field to lead the race with 13 laps to go before that life-changing crash.
Given the severity of his injuries, the doctors at the scene of the accident said Zanardi should never have survived.
Remarkably just two months later, he was walking again using prosthetic legs of his own design. Another two years on, he finished the race that nearly took his life, completing the remaining 13 laps at Lausitz in a specially modified touring car.
By 2004 he was racing touring cars fulltime with the help of hand-operated brake and accelerator paddles. Zanardi even drove a modified BMW Formula One car in 2006.
Rwandan amputees bring message of hope: 'We are superstars'
But while most motorsport stars find it difficult to give up their high-octane thrills, Zanardi did just that.
It has been a long road to the London 2012 Paralympics for the Rwandan men's sitting volleyball team, which is the best in Africa.
Team captain Dominique Bizimana told CNN: "I think we are superstars. For us disability is nothing. We are able. We are making sure we tell people disability is nothing. It is not inability."
Most of the players are amputees from the country's 1994 genocide.
As many as one million people were killed when a civil war between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis broke out.
Hundreds of thousands of people were left maimed, but sport has provided an outlet for many and helped reconciliation between the two communities. Both Hutus and Tutsis are in the volleyball team.
The game itself is fast paced and, according to the team's Dutch coach, technically more demanding than able-bodied volleyball.
The team's training facilities in the capital Kigali are basic. The players hope to spring a surprise or two, but lost their opening game to Iran, one of the favorites for gold.
The Rwandans will also face Brazil, China and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Pool B. Sit down, stand up

Rwanda's sitting volleyball team
Elliot Mujaji was a member of Zimbabwe's national athletics team and qualified to compete at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, when he suffered severe burns in an electrical accident. His right arm was amputated, and he remained in a coma for two months. He came back to athletics, and won the first ever Paralympic gold for his country.
South Africa's "Blade Runner" Oscar Pistorius made history at London 2012 by becoming the first double amputee to compete on the track and make an Olympic final. He is the favorite in the Paralympics 100 meters run. In 1995, while training to become a professional runner, Henry Wanyoike became almost completely blind after suffering a stroke. He got back to competing, and became one of the fastest men on the planet. He holds two world records in 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and the record time for marathon.
Achmat Hassiem lost his foot to a Great White shark when participating in a lifeguard training session in 2006. After an amazing recovery, he qualified for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics and has been competing ever since. Inset picture: Hassiem shows off a fragment of a shark's tooth that was stuck in his leg after he was attacked.
South African Natalie Du Toit lost her left leg when she was hit by a car as a young promising swimmer. She kept training and, besides winning five gold medals in Beijing Paralympics, she qualified for Beijing Olympics 10 km swimming race, finishing 16th. She recently announced London will be her last major competition.
The star of Egyptian powerlifting, Metwaly Mathana started the sport at the age of 5. According to his bio with the Egyptian Paralympic committee, he had to leave his village as there was not enough steel for him to keep lifting. He won three gold medals in three consecutive Games. Tunisia's Somaya Bousaid won two gold medals in Beijing 2008 Games -- and became one of the most successful athletes from her country. She was born blind and competes in the category of visually-impaired athletes. Cyclist Roxy Burns, a South African cerebral palsy sufferer, made her Paralympic debut in Beijing in 2008. As an 18-year-old, she finished sixth in the 500 meters track time trial. Her results have been improving since Beijing and she is one of the favorites for a medal.
Tesfalem Gebru Kebede won a bronze medal in last year's world championship and is one of Ethiopia's top athletes. He lost his hand when his house was bombed during the Ethio-Eritrea war.

Paralympics Opening Ceremony
"Three years ago I decided to stop motor racing, not because I had to but because I wanted to," he said.
"It looked stupid, because at the age of 42 to dump everything to try to pursue an objective to qualify for the Games seemed to be against all odds for a man of my age.
"It felt very crazy but it's not the first crazy thing that I do in my life, so I guess it will not be the last."
Zanardi replaced one adrenaline buzz with another.
He discovered hand cycling -- a sport where the bikes are powered by the riders' arms -- at the 2007 New York marathon.
Invited to speak as a guest, Zanardi decided if he was going to fly all the way from Italy to the U.S. he might as well compete. Compete he did, finishing fourth after only a few weeks' training.
He had found his new passion, competing in the 2009 world championships and then setting about qualifying for the 2012 Paralympics.
"This was the horizon," he said, smiling as a burst of brilliant, afternoon sunshine lit up his face following his victory in the H4 classification road time trial.
"I'm very, very happy. It's never been a sacrifice. I've enjoyed every day of training as much as this moment now."
Paralympic sailing: A tale of triumph and technology
Immediately after his win, the F1 family -- including former world champions Mario Andretti and Jenson Button -- took to social media sites to congratulate Zanardi.
Although he was only briefly in their ranks, he is still remembered as one of the sport's "nice guys" and most charismatic competitors.

Paralympian Paul left his Wall Street job to take over Sail to Prevail - an organization which teaches disabled children to sail. From eight children a year, the charity, based in Newport, Rhode Island, now helps around 1,000 youngsters annually.
Paul, left, competes in the three-person sailing event at the Sydney Paralympics in 2000. The U.S. failed to win a medal, but gold is on the cards at London 2012 Callahan says.
Paul became a quadriplegic after slipping on a wet floor and breaking his neck as a 21-year-old. He was paralyzed from the chest down, keeping the use of his arms, but not his hands.

U.S. Paralympic sailor Paul Callahan eyes gold
The golden ending to his journey came at Brands Hatch, a circuit 20 miles from London where Zanardi had previously raced in a touring car.
"With an engine pushing me I didn't realize it was that hilly," he said.
"It's very, very hard but if I had to design the course for the Games this is what I would have done. It's absolutely beautiful, it's very hard -- I guess it really suits my characteristics as an old man."
So how does the thrill of winning a cycling race compare to the highs of motor racing?
"When you are in your twenties you just think the races are what matter the most," Zanardi said.
"When you are in your forties you really appreciate what you do every day. Of course today is very important but I really appreciate what I did in the past.
"Day by day, it's been magical, a magical adventure and this is a fantastic conclusion."
It seems unlikely that a man who could not be bowed by losing both of his legs will retire from sport anytime soon.
He has already mooted a possible return at the 2016 Rio Games, but Zanardi also joked that his next plan was to add another wheel and engine to his cycle and come back to Brands Hatch.
The circuit also hosts Superbike racing and, judging by the glint in his eye, perhaps Zanardi is already weighing up a new challenge of trying out a faster form of wheeled sport.

Great gadgets for holiday giving
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 5:23 PM EST, Fri January 4, 2013 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
The new Windows 8 devices have some much-needed personality -- and none more so than the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13. This is a bendy, touchscreen Ultrabook that costs $1,000. You can fold the screen all the way back to use it as a tablet and get the most out of the new Windows 8 touchscreen interface. Just in time for New Year's resolutions, these beefed-up pedometers track more than steps. The Fitbit Zip (left, $60) tracks steps, calories and distance, and lets you compete against friends. The Nike+ Sportwatch GPS (right, $169) records your location, pace, calories and heart rate while keeping you motivated with gentle reminders. Ever wonder what your dog or cat is up to when you're not around? This wearable, battery-powered device will shoot up to two-and-a-half hours of video for you to upload later with a USB cable, included. Available for $99 from Dogtek.com.
Ten-inch tablets are so last year. This season's hottest gifts are ultraportable 7-inch tablets. They're great for consuming media, and there are quality options for each major operating system. The iPad Mini (left) starts at $329, and Google's Android-based Nexus 7 (right) starts at $199. Tablets are perfect for playing games and watching movies, but avid readers might prefer a mono-tasking device that's easy on the eyes. These E Ink readers have excellent battery life and work in low light. The Kindle Paperwhite (left, $119 with ads) is great for Amazon Prime members. The Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight (right, $119) reads standard ePub files. Cleaning your floor isn't fun -- unless you have a smart floor-cleaning robot that you can control with a remote while sipping a cocktail. Roombas are pricey, from $350 up to $700, but they know exactly where to clean and even go under the bed without complaining (except sometimes on Twitter). This nifty box connects to your DVR or cable set-top box and streams live, high-definition video from your TV to your laptop, tablet or smartphone -- no matter where you are. The Slingbox also gives you remote access to what's stored on your DVR. Available for $179 from electronics retailers.
Another bit of the future for your home, the Nest thermostat learns your patterns and automates setting the temperature of your home to save money and energy. The Nest, created by a former iPod designer, costs $249. The company just released an upgraded version that's compatible with almost all heating and cooling systems.
One problem with singing in the shower is the lack of backup music. The new $199 Moxie showerhead from Kohler addresses this serious problem by placing a removable speaker inside the middle of the actual showerhead. The speaker pairs with your smartphone or music device of choice over Bluetooth. Inexpensive pocket cameras are being replaced by smartphones. But for serious photographers who want a high-quality compact camera, there's Sony's new RX1. It's the smallest available camera with a full-frame sensor, although the price tag is an exorbitant $2,799. For a more reasonably priced, quality compact camera, check out the Fujifilm X10. Do you find typing on a tablet tiresome? This flexible silicone keyboard may be for you. It pairs wirelessly with your Bluetooth-enabled iPad and rolls up for easy storage or travel. It's also waterproof, which is handy for clumsy coffee drinkers. Available for $60 from Brookstone.
This is for the Instagram enthusiast in your life. The Impossible Project sells refurbished Polaroid cameras, including the Sun 660 ($140). The camera comes with two packs of PX 680 film, and will make you an instant hit at parties. You can even use your smartphone to take a photo of the Polaroid to share on the social network of your choice. For the safety-mided types in your family, these two gadgets are smart additions to any emergency kit. The $100 SpareOne GMS emergency mobile phone runs on AA batteries, doubles as a flashlight, can be located in an emergency and will stay charged (if you don't use it) for up to 15 years. The $60 BoostTurbine2000 is a small backup battery with a hand crank. There's some overlap between coffee geeks and gadget geeks. This beautiful electric coffee dripper from Bodum is for them. Awkwardly named the Bistro b. over, it mixes smart tech with delicious drip coffee. The maker costs $250 and comes in black, red, green or white. Built-in smartphone and tablet speakers don't, as a rule, rock. This portable Bluetooth speaker is the perfect solution. It combines slick design with great sound quality and is available in a variety of customizable colors and textures. The Jawbone Jambox is just 2.24 inches tall and costs $199.
The Bowers & Wilkins P5 headphones are not for people content with cheap in-ear buds. These are hi-fi headphones made out of sheep leather and metal, designed to cushion your ears and fill them with rich-sounding tunes while blocking out the rest of the world. The $300 headphones also have a built-in mic so you can take phone calls.

The dark side of social media: A new way to rape
By Rebecca Campbell, Special to CNN
updated 5:44 AM EDT, Wed April 17, 2013
Canadian teenager Rehtaeh Parsons, who was allegedly gang-raped and bullied, was hospitalized after she tried to hang herself on Thursday, April 4. The high school student from Halifax, Nova Scotia, was taken off life support three days later. Two 18-year-old men face child pornography charges in connection with the case.
A Facebook tribute page set up by her mother, Leah Parsons, shows Parsons over the years.
She struggled emotionally, especially after a police investigation ended without criminal charges, her mother wrote on her tribute page.
She developed suicidal thoughts as a result of the sexual assault and bullying that followed, according to her family.
"An investigation was conducted into the alleged sexual assault," said Cpl. Scott MacRae, a spokesman for the police. "In consultation with the crown, the decision was made that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with charges." The teen's relatives said they hope their story helps families going through the same pain.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Rebecca Campbell: The rate of sexual assaults is alarmingly high among adolescents
Campbell: Rape is a crime of power and dominance, and social media make it worse
She says perpetrators make victims feel worse when they circulate sexual assault photos
Campbell: We must reform the criminal justice system and do more to prevent cyberbullying Editor's note: Rebecca Campbell is professor of psychology at Michigan State University. (CNN) -- Fifteen-year-old Audrie Pott got drunk at a party and passed out. What happened next, according to her family, was that she was sexually assaulted by multiple young men, who took photos and circulated them in their high school of more than 1,000 students. Not long afterward, Audrie, devastated and hopeless, committed suicide.
In Canada, Rehtaeh Parsons, then 15, was sexually assaulted by multiple perpetrators, according to her family, and photographs were also posted online for the world to see. She was tormented and bullied for more than a year with no legal action taken by the authorities, who stated there was "insufficient evidence" to file charges. Rehtaeh also committed suicide.
Why did these tragedies happen?
Rebecca Campbell
The rate of sexual assaults is alarmingly high among adolescents. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Justice finds that 30% to 35% of female sexual assault survivors were first raped between the ages of 11 to 17. Many of these assaults occur when victims are under the influence of alcohol, and a surprising number of adolescent rapes involve multiple perpetrators. A recent study found that 12.4% of sexual assaults committed against 13- to 17-year-old teens were gang rapes.
When evidence goes viral
Rape is a crime of power and dominance, and social media provide new ways of asserting that power to hurt victims over and over again. Gang rape takes on a whole new meaning when images and slurs are posted and forwarded and spread endlessly. Adolescent sexual assaults are particularly likely to go viral (more so than instances of adult rape) because of the "everyone knows everything about everyone" culture of middle and high school. The ubiquity of cell phones with cameras and the power of the Internet make for faster, farther-reaching gossip, name-calling, character assassination and ultimately despair for the victim.

What was once a horrible incident that the victim remembers and suffers in private agony has now become an all-you-can-watch public humiliation event.
There's ample evidence that bullying has grown widespread, but the crime of rape has always been around. We live in a culture in which victims are blamed for the assault and made to feel like they are the ones who are criminal and dirty and shameful. Many rape victims are afraid to report the assault to police because they believe the criminal system will not help them. And they're right.
A recent National Institute of Justice study found that among adolescent sexual assault victims who did the brave the system -- they filed a police report, they met with investigators, they endured a medical forensic exam and rape kit -- 60% of these cases were not prosecuted by the criminal justice system. These rates are even worse for adult victims: On average, 86% of sexual assaults that are reported to the police are never passed along to prosecutors even to be considered for prosecution. That's 86% that go nowhere. Police re-open rape probe after suicide
Anger after teen commits suicide
The cases weren't forwarded to prosecutors because police said there was "insufficient evidence," or because they thought the victim was "making a false report," or because the victim "wasn't credible" -- despite the fact that all of these victims had a sexual assault medical forensic exam and forensic evidence collection kit ("rape kit"). These cases were closed with either no investigation at all, or minimal investigational effort. A recent report from Human Rights Watch suggests this is an alarmingly common practice.
When the criminal justice system doesn't listen, doesn't investigate, doesn't seem to care, it sends the message to rapists: You will not be held accountable for your crimes.
Perhaps it is not surprising that several studies have found most rapists are serial rapists. To victims, this inaction sends the message: Your suffering is not our concern. You don't matter.
Rehtaeh's case went nowhere. Only now, after her death, will it be reopened.
How can this be changed?
One, reform the criminal justice system. Train legal personnel on best practices for the investigation and prosecution of these crimes. Challenge law enforcement agencies to start by believing and to investigate, not shelve, these crimes. Demand that police see these images on social media for what they are: not pornographic exploits but evidence of a crime.
Two, we must get survivors to the services that can help them. The despair that victims experience can all too quickly consume them and destroy their lives. The federal Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act provide funding to all states and territories for rape crisis hotlines, crisis counseling and victim advocacy programs. These services are provided free of charge. Friends, family, teachers, everyone can help let survivors know that help is available.
And finally, we have to do more to prevent cyberbullying. The important truth not to lose sight of is that most teens do not commit sexual assaults and most do not bully. We need to support and empower these youth to speak out and intervene with their peers. The CDC has resources for schools and communities to develop "bystander prevention programs," which teach effective strategies youth can use to prevent violence among their peers. Widespread adoption of these programs is critical.
For girls such as Audrie Potts, Rehtaeh Parsons and many untold others, their agony had become too much, and the only solution they saw was suicide. We will never again hear their words, their stories, their voices.
But our voices can still be heard, and we must demand solutions to this seemingly intractable problem. We owe all victims justice and compassion.

Out of jobs, out of benefits, out of luck
By David Frum, CNN Contributor
updated 3:30 PM EST, Mon December 30, 2013
Job seekers attend a job fair in Chicago in 2012. When the doors opened at 9 a.m., the line was half a mile long.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Frum: Mass joblessness isn't going away; wages are falling
Frum: U.S. used to provide minimal benefits but lots of jobs, but not now
Public-sector hiring is helpful, he says, but how many can government employ or afford? Frum: Cuts to food stamp and unemployment benefits punish jobless when no jobs exist
Editor's note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, "Patriots," and a post-election e-book, "Why Romney Lost." Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002.
(CNN) -- The old deal made rough sense.
The United States would provide only a very thin social-insurance cushion for people of working age, but jobs would always be available. Critics might deride the jobs as McJobs: often poorly paid, often offering scanty benefits. But better McJobs than No Jobs. To anyone who proposed tighter job protections or more generous social benefits workers came the crushing answer, "Do you want us to be like Europe?"
While American generated tens of millions of low-wage service jobs, the economies of Europe struggled hard not to lose jobs, even during good times. The tradeoff was patiently explained by free-market economists and is by now familiar to us all. More job rules mean less jobs; fewer rules will bring more jobs.
David Frum
And for a quarter-century, from 1982 until 2007, the old deal held true. Wages didn't rise much, but demand for nurses' aides, fast food servers and other low-wage service workers surged and surged -- so much that for the first time since 1913, the United States again found itself welcoming a mass immigration of poor people, arriving legally and illegally from Guadalajara and Guangzhou, eager to accept America's abundant $9-an-hour jobs.
Then, suddenly, the old deal broke down. It broke down as abruptly, as utterly and as seemingly irretrievably as a previous old deal broke in 1929. Mass and long-term joblessness characterize the U.S. economy of 2014 as surely as plentiful low-wage jobs characterized the U.S. economy of 15 years ago. Look at the output statistics, and the United States has recovered from the crisis of 2008. Look at the job numbers, and it seems the United States never will.
What are Americans to think of and do about their new economic dispensation?
One answer is to deny that the dispensation is new at all.
Republicans in Congress are working to repeal the emergency job benefits put in place in 2009, on the familiar theory that if we quit paying the unemployed, they'll stop being unemployed. Extended unemployment insurance coverage lapsed on Saturday; 1.3 million long-term jobless lost benefits that day, and those still receiving benefits will lose them if they remain without work for longer than 26 weeks.
Food stamp coverage has been cut once and will probably be cut again in 2014. Proposals to raise the minimum wage gain no hearing in the Republican-majority House of Representatives, whose members condemn such proposals as job-killers.
Yet these familiar arguments bump into an unfamiliar situation. Almost six years after the economic collapse of 2008, the ratio of job seekers to unfilled positions -- which peaked at 5.5 to 1 -- has declined to 2.9 to 1, a ratio that would until now have indicated severe recession.
Stocks rally on strong jobs report
Jobs report better than expected
The huge backlog of unemployed workers exerts downward pressure on the wages of those still working. The old employment deal seems a formula for a massive write-off of the great majority of working Americans lacking specialized skills.
On the other hand, nobody seems to offer any credible new deal. Some cities and towns are experimenting with higher minimum wages. That may put money in the pockets of some workers at Wal-Mart and Starbucks. But people who can't find work at $9 won't find it easier to find work if their price is raised to $12.
In a major economic address delivered in Osawatomie, Kansas, in 2011, President Obama speculated that more public-sector hiring might do the trick. But how many people can government employ? And how sustainable is it for government to raise its payroll at exactly the same time as it is also shouldering the rising costs of Medicare and Social Security for retiring baby boomers?
These are questions that will dominate American politics for years to come. As the European experience of the 1990s sadly reminds us, mass prolonged unemployment is not a problem that recedes rapidly in a peacetime economy. People who have been out of work would find it hard to return to work even in a strong job market -- and this job market remains desperately weak.
What we can at least do is refrain from further penalizing people whose problems nobody knows how to fix.
People who can't work still must eat. Americans in distress have a claim on the rest of the nation. Extend unemployment insurance. Sustain food stamps. While we're looking for a new deal, at least quit deluding ourselves that the old deal is still operable. It's not. It has passed on, from everywhere except our increasingly outdated memories.

GOP's War On Pet Projects Bogs Down In Temptation
By Andrew Taylor, CQ Staff Writer
(CQ, Aug. 22, 1998) -- Freshman GOP Rep. Bob Schaffer represents a sprawling congressional district in eastern Colorado, where ranchers and farmers can drive dozens of miles to buy a quart of milk, visit the doctor or shop at a hardware store. Good roads are important.
But when the massive highway bill (PL 105-178) was pieced together earlier this year, Schaffer was not among those lining up to bring federally funded road and bridge projects to his district. The rigidly conservative Schaffer did not come to Congress to bring pet projects back home.
"I asked for zero . . . largely because I thought the practice of pork spending . . . was unethical and is exactly what's sick about Washington," Schaffer said. "So I just resolved early on that I wouldn't take anything."
His reluctance to bring home the bacon has earned him some flak from his Democratic opponent in the November elections, former Fort Collins Mayor Susan Kirkpatrick, but Schaffer shrugs it off. And he notes that his Fort Collins "hometown newspaper, which is pretty liberal and usually opposes me, agreed with me on this one."
To the dismay of self-described "pork-busters" such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Schaffer is the exception, not the rule.
The GOP tidal wave of 1994 brought to the Capitol many idealistic lawmakers determined to change the ways of Washington, including the age-old practice of stuffing spending bills with hometown projects. But after more than three years in the majority, many junior Republican revolutionaries have yielded to the attractions of pet projects. They may have lambasted Democratic-controlled Congresses for loading up bills with "pork barrel" spending, but now that Republicans are running the show, the fight against such projects -- never a pitched battle to begin with -- is barely more than a skirmish.
"After we first took over, there was a reduction, but now I see it growing again," McCain said. He added that Republicans' continuing penchant for pet projects is "one of my greatest disappointments" since 1994.
McCain has scrubbed 10 of the 13 fiscal 1999 spending bills -- the ones that have already made it through the Senate Appropriations Committee. He found $9.1 billion in unrequested line items, known as earmarks, including a $1.5 billion amphibious assault ship to be built, almost literally, in the backyard of Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
For many Republicans, sponsoring pet projects is just one part of a job description that also includes cutting taxes and shrinking government. The irony of conservative Republicans such as David M. McIntosh of Indiana and Zach Wamp of Tennessee carrying forward the GOP revolution of 1995 at the same time they practice the parochial politics of pork is not lost on budget hawks such as Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a private watchdog group.
"As long as they think it helps them get re-elected, you're going to find a lot of this stuff," Schatz said. "With a small majority in the House, you are going to find things to help yourself stay in power."
New York moderate Republican Jack Quinn, for example, whose district voted by a margin of almost 2-to-1 for President Clinton in 1996, works hard to bring federal money to his Buffalo-based district. Quinn's predecessor, Democrat Henry Nowak (1975-93), brought an estimated $1 billion to the district during his career on the Public Works and Transportation Committee. Quinn uses the same post on the panel, now known as the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, to cement his hold on his Democratic-leaning district.
"I actively sought that committee because Nowak was on there for 20 years," Quinn said. "It doesn't hurt to return federal dollars. It doesn't hurt at all."
Even stalwart conservatives make an exception when it comes to their district's needs. Rep. Robert B. Aderholt, R-Ala., is a religious conservative devoted to shrinking government and cutting taxes. But he also is following Democrat Tom Bevill (1967-97), who used his post as chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee to produce projects such as the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, a $3 billion barge canal that cuts through Alabama to the Gulf of Mexico.
Narrowly elected in 1996, Aderholt was promptly rewarded with a spot on Appropriations, and he proudly highlights his efforts to help bring highway and other projects to northern Alabama, including $200 million for a Memphis-Birmingham superhighway. The project will help him in his November race against Bevill's son, Don.
Incumbent Protection Program
That Republicans used the recently enacted transportation bill and the ongoing appropriations cycle to satisfy their parochial needs should not be a surprise. Bringing home federal projects and grants is a time-tested way of proving one's worth as a lawmaker. It may not broaden one's mass appeal, but it is a big part of shoring up support among key constituencies.
"It usually isn't anything that people put in television commercials, because it takes on a pejorative connotation, but in local communities, in the local press with the local leaders, it takes on great significance," said New York Rep. Bill Paxon, former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
As for past Republican attacks on the pet project practices of entrenched Democrats, Paxon said: "Then, it was just an effective attack on a macro level. . . . But on a micro level it is still a grand slam for many."
Republicans also recognize that many members of their narrow House majority of 228 members (to 206 Democrats) come from districts that were held for years by Democrats, who got themselves re-elected in part by bringing home pet projects. Doing so is part of the job in districts such as Aderholt's or that of Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who succeeded Appropriations Committee titan Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss. (1941-95). It is no coincidence that Wicker promptly gained a seat on Appropriations.
Democrats are hesitant to make an issue of Republicans' parochial ways. Pet projects have always been attractive to members of both parties. In an increasingly polarized House, awarding such projects to members is one of the few oases of bipartisanship.
"I have to tell you that in my experience, [Republicans] have been very cooperative," said Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., a member of the Appropriations Committee.
Eye of the Beholder
An old congressional adage is that pork is what you find in the other guy's district.
But pinning down the difference between unjustifiable pork and a meritorious earmark is not easy. Sometimes a provision must pass the know it when you see it test. An example is report language for the Senate appropriations bill (S2168) for the departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that earmarks $1 million from the Community Development Block Grant programs to establish the Center for Early Southern Life at Alabama Constitution Village in Huntsville. Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., is a member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. "Pork-busters" such as McCain and Citizens Against Government Waste have developed criteria aimed at determining which congressional earmarks are the most questionable.
McCain -- whose World Wide Web site features an animated pig pushing a barrel filled with greenbacks across the screen -- produces a detailed analysis of each spending bill as it comes to the Senate floor. McCain's staff scours each bill for designations that have not been approved by the relevant authorizing committee, were not requested by the president, were slipped in during a House-Senate conference, or would improperly transfer or sell federal property to help a friend, such as a mayor or governor.
McCain agreed that many of the projects that make his rosters have merit. The "criteria are not intended to reflect a judgment on the merits of an item," McCain said in a statement. "They are designed to identify projects that have not been considered in an appropriate, merit-based prioritization process."
Defenders of congressional earmarks challenge McCain's criteria as too simplistic. They question, for example, why the president's budget should be held sacrosanct when Clinton has included debatable items such as the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program, which subsidizes private industry's efforts to develop cutting-edge technologies. Congressional Republicans also take a generally dim view of the Pentagon's dual-use technology program, which promotes the use of defense technologies by the private sector. "There's pork in the president's budget," concedes a senior administration staff aide.
Moreover, the president's budget often deliberately low-balls money for programs that it knows are congressional favorites. That practice produces money for other programs supported by the administration.
For example, the official fiscal 1999 budget released in February included no money for new federal courthouse construction. But the General Services Administration, which oversees the program, requested $521 million in its annual budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget -- which may more accurately reflect the administration's priorities. The House spending bill (HR4104) for Treasury-Postal Service programs would provide exactly $521 million; the Senate bill would provide $553 million. An effective tactic to grease the way for a hometown project is to lobby to get it included in the president's budget. Former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore. (1967-97), was a master at this.
Lawmakers also argue that they are more knowledgeable about the needs of their districts than Washington-based agency officials.
Futile Fight
It has never been easy to combat federal designations for districts or states, and Congress has never shown much determination to check them. And with the swift advance out of deficit spending into an era of federal budget surpluses, lawmakers' appetites for fighting pork seem to be flagging.
Still, although the budget is projected to produce a $63 billion surplus for fiscal 1998, tight "caps" on discretionary spending are tying appropriators in knots. Critics of earmarking say it takes money away from more valuable programs and, because of the caps, the practice is as damaging as ever.
Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste estimates that $12 billion to $15 billion in unnecessary designations will make their way into the annual appropriations bills each year. Total appropriations for fiscal 1999 are expected to reach about $565 billion, depending on the end game between Congress and Clinton. Based on the watchdog group's calculations, parochial spending represents about 2 percent of the discretionary budget.
McCain and other self-described pork-busters, such as Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., and Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., have few tools in their arsenal, other than the cleansing power of publicity.
Perhaps the most effective way to get rid of unneeded projects is to spotlight them in the media. For example, news segments such as NBC News' "The Fleecing of America" have heaped ridicule on Congress for items such as an $800,000 outhouse for a federal park. As a result, Schatz said, fewer items that appear silly -- such as a museum in North Dakota to honor bandleader Lawrence Welk -- now make it into the bills.
For his part, McCain has toned down his efforts somewhat. He no longer offers amendments -- which have proved futile -- to strip unrequested projects from bills. But he still has his staff bird-dog the Senate floor when appropriations bills are up, scrubbing amendments for suspicious items.
"They look at every amendment," McCain said. "It's a real disincentive" for members trying to add earmarks on the floor.
Oddly, among the biggest fans of his efforts, McCain said, is Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is legendary for his aggressive attempts to steer federal dollars to his state. McCain said Stevens has told him his pork-busting efforts help him curb fellow senators' appetites for earmarks.
Said McCain: "When they come in and ask for pork, [Stevens] says 'You're going to have to get it by McCain.' " McCain's Web site routinely criticizes Stevens' designations for Alaska, but the old-school chairman does not mind such publicity.
In the House, Royce and Minge lead a small band of budget hawks who take to the floor and try to kill objectionable programs. They almost always lose, Royce acknowledged. But he added that they have won some changes in some of the programs they criticize, such as the Market Access Program, which subsidizes overseas advertising for U.S. commodities. Corporations, he said, now have to match some of the subsidy.
And after years of attacks, money for the Forest Service's timber road construction program was dumped from the fiscal 1999 Interior spending bill (HR4193). Perhaps the most potent tool against congressional designations was the line-item veto, which President Clinton wielded for less than a year before the 1996 law (PL 104-130) was overturned by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. But Clinton was timid in his use of the veto, and it did not deter lawmakers from their usual parochial practices. ©1998 Congressional Quarterly Inc. All rights reserved.
