French suburbs rocked by more riotsStory Highlights Riots in French suburb for second night after two teens killed in police crash Violence spreads from Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, to two nearby towns More than 60 police injured, bombarded with Molotov cocktails and bottles of acid Parallels drawn with unrest in 2005, when President Sarkozy was interior ministerNext Article in World » Read VIDEO PARIS, France (CNN) -- The Paris suburbs were again rocked by riots after a second night of lawlessness Monday caused widespread destruction and left scores of police injured, according to French authorities and media reports. Firefighters in a Paris suburb battle to control a blaze started after youths rioted Sunday night. An angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings in the town of Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, after two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car Sunday night. Rioters bombarded police with baseball bats, Molotov cocktail bombs and bottles filled with acid as the violence spread to the nearby towns of Longjumeau and Grigby Monday night. The 15- and 16-year-old boys, both sons of African immigrants, according to police, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in Villiers-le-Bel. Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their French-born children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. However, three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation. Watch why a repeat of past rioting is feared » More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday night's confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition, according to reports in a number of French newspapers. A spokesman for the police authorities in the Val d'Oise prefecture refused to confirm the numbers of police injuries, telling CNN that police feared the information could further enflame the already tense situation. The police spokesman said 60 cars, a library and car dealer's showroom had been set on fire in Villiers-le-Bel. He said a police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town, the spokesman said. Don't Miss Riots rock Paris suburb for second night

Villiers-le-Bel was not among the districts hit by the weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005, when disaffected youths nationwide set thousands of cars ablaze to protest against unemployment and discrimination. Those riots were also sparked by fatalities, namely the deaths of two men of North African descent who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical substation. French president Nicolas Sarkozy, then serving as the interior minister, provoked controversy at the time by referring to the rioters as "scum." Sarkozy, currently on a state visit to China, had urged residents Monday to "cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what." A spokesman for the president's office told CNN Tuesday they were continuing to monitor the situation. The prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begun an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an unregistered bike. But Omar Sehhouli, the brother of one of the victims, told French media the police involved should be arrested. "Everyone knew the two boys here," he told French radio. "What happened, that's not violence, it's rage." According to the initial findings from the French police watchdog, reported Tuesday in the daily newspaper, Le Figaro, the boy's motorbike was driving "at very high speed" and had failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle. The police car was driving normally at around 40 kilometers an hour, the newspaper reported the watchdog had found. E-mail to a friend CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report

Video of church's 'casting out' gay 'demon' in teen sparks angerStory Highlights Video of Manifested Glory Ministries members shouting at boy upsets groups "You homosexual demon, get up on outta here!" church members say Pastor on public response: "I've been threatened already, I've been attacked"Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO By Kristen Hamill CNN	(CNN) -- The boy writhes uncontrollably on the floor, but the church members remain calm, if increasingly loud. They're trying to drive a "demon" out of him. In the video, Manifested Glory Ministries members gather around a boy in Bridgeport, Connecticut. "You homosexual demon, get up on outta here!" they say. "You demon, loose yourself!" "You sex demon ... you snake!" The shouts, the convulsions, the references to homosexual spirits -- they are all captured on a video posted on YouTube by the Manifested Glory Ministries. The video has sparked anger among gay youth advocacy groups and put the small church from Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the middle of an ongoing national debate on gay issues. Patricia McKinney, pastor of the nondenominational church who describes herself as a prophet, said she has even been receiving death threats as a result of the video, but doesn't understand the outrage. "I believe in deliverance, I believe in anointing, I believe in the power of Jesus," she said in a phone interview with CNN. "I've been threatened already, I've been attacked, and it doesn't make any sense to us. Really, what they're doing, they're putting me out there on the mat."

Gay critics say 'too little, too late' from Obama
McKinney says she doesn't refer to the events of the video as an exorcism, but rather a "casting out of unclean spirits." She said this isn't the first time that an event like this has taken place at her church, but it is the first one centered around homosexuality. McKinney said the boy approached the church and told her he wanted to be a pastor, but was struggling with his sexuality. "We allow [gay people] to come into our church. We just don't allow them to come in and continue to live that lifestyle," she said. "God made Adam and Eve," she said. "He made a woman to be with a man, and a man to be with a woman." Robin McHaelen, who worked with the 16-year-old boy at the center of the video in her position as executive director of True Colors Inc., a gay youth advocacy and mentoring program in Connecticut, said the video was taped in March. She would not identify the teen. McHaelen said she doesn't think the church acted maliciously -- but that's part of her problem with the video. "None of the people in this video were intending to hurt this kid," she said. "They performed this ritual in an attempt to rid him of feelings that he didn't want to have." The boy is the fifth teen True Colors is aware of that has undergone an event like the one documented in the video. But unlike the boy, not all the teens approached a church or religious organization. The event, McHaelen said, reflects a culture and society that doesn't believe a person can be both Christian and gay. "That's what makes me so sad and so mad," she said. McHaelen said she talked to the boy since the incident and said he's feeling very conflicted and confused in trying to reconcile who he is with his religion. "He's 16 and having the feelings that he's having, the relationships he's having, and then [he's] being tormented by 'What if I'm going to go to hell because of what I feel and who I am?'" she said. McHaelen notified the Connecticut Department of Children and Families, as she's mandated to do in her position when she suspects abuse or neglect of a minor. However, she told CNN the department will be looking into whether or not abuse or neglect occurred by the parents and family of the boy, not the church. The department declined to comment Thursday. Isaiah Webster, Director of Communications for the National Youth Advocacy Commission, said he was deeply saddened by the timing of the video and the accompanying uproar. "It's very, very sad that this still takes place in society," he said. "It's also very sad that it comes about during this week, [as the] 40th anniversary of Stonewall is this weekend." The so-called "Stonewall Riots" are believed by many to have kicked off the gay liberation movement. "That is really something to celebrate," Webster continued, "and it's unfortunate that young people still have to endure things like this." McHaelen said that as an advocacy group, she doesn't think True Colors can take any legal action against the church, and said she would rather engage in an open dialogue with its members.

Federal authorities drop deportation case against same-sex partner By Adriana Hauser, CNN Deportation of same-sex partner droppedSTORY HIGHLIGHTSVenezuelan had faced deportation proceedingsHe is legally married to an AmericanFederal officials have decided not to pursue caseImmigration employees get discretion on specific cases (CNN) -- Federal authorities have stopped the deportation of a gay immigrant legally married to a United States citizen. Venezuelan Henry Velandia came to the United States almost a decade ago to dance. The 27-year-old salsa dancer met American Josh Vandiver five years ago. The New Jersey couple legally married in Connecticut less than a year ago. In 2009, with the support of a sponsor and before his marriage, Velandia applied for a green card. But instead of obtaining legal residency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) started a deportation process. "I thought my world was crumbling," said Velandia. His spouse, Vandiver, said "the only reason the federal government was not recognizing the marriage was the Defense of the Marriage Act." The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was signed into law in 1996. It protects the legal parameters surrounding the definition of marriage at the federal level, which recognizes the union as a man and a woman. While President Barack Obama has repeatedly said the executive branch does not support DOMA, federal agencies continue to enforce it. "Pursuant to the Attorney General's guidance, the Defense of Marriage Act remains in effect and the Executive Branch, including DHS, will continue to enforce it unless and until Congress repeals it or there a final judicial determination that it is unconstitutional," ICE said in a statement this week. With the help of immigration lawyers Lavi Soloway and Noemi Masliah, the couple began an effort to halt the deportation. Soloway has said the federal agency should focus on deporting dangerous criminals instead of separating families. He asked for prosecutorial discretion. Velandia has since appeared in several immigration hearings and, on May 6, was granted a temporary 7-month reprieve from deportation. Soloway indicated that on June 9, Newark, New Jersey, chief counsel Jane Minichiello said ICE had "reconsidered the request and decided to move for Administrative Closure because this case was not an enforcement priority at this time." It was not until June 29 that attorneys Soloway and Masliah actually received the judge's order terminating Velandia's removal proceedings. "We are celebrating the future we just got now that my deportation was stopped," said Velandia. "We had this enormous burden over us that my husband of less than a year would be taken away from me and we'd be torn apart. Now we are celebrating that we get to be together indefinitely in this country," added Vandiver. John Morton, director of ICE, recently reminded in a memo that officials use "prosecutorial discretion" in specific cases. ICE emphasizes that its priority is to focus on dangerous criminals. This decision could set a precedent for thousands of gay couples. A study from UCLA estimates that about 36,000 gay couples are made up of a U.S. citizen and a non-citizen. Some activist groups in favor of same sex marriage believe the number could be higher. The decision does not grant Velandia legal permanent residence, but the couple says it buys them time to keep fighting for their cause and other same-sex couples. "Couples who love each other should stay together," said Velandia.

McAfee returns to Guatemalan detention center after hospital visit
By Miguel Salay, For CNN
updated 5:53 AM EST, Fri December 7, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
An attorney says John McAfee had a nervous breakdown, but no heart problems
The 67-year-old software company founder is back in immigration detention
Guatemalan officials say they've rejected McAfee's request for asylum
McAfee's attorneys request an injunction, saying "due process has been violated" Guatemala City (CNN) -- Software pioneer John McAfee ended the day Thursday as he started it: imprisoned in a Guatemalan immigration detention center.
Earlier, a neon green ambulance had whisked the 67-year-old to a police hospital just hours after officials rejected his bid for asylum. McAfee's legal team said doctors were treating him for cardiovascular problems.
Later, attorney Telesforo Guerra offered a different diagnosis: McAfee had suffered a nervous breakdown, but tests showed he did not have heart problems.
The series of events were the latest dramatic twists in a saga that reads like a best-selling mystery, with poisoned dogs, a dead neighbor and international intrigue fueled by weeks on the run.
The next chapter could unfold in Belize, where Guatemalan officials said they were preparing to deport McAfee after rejecting his asylum bid.
McAfee seeks asylum in Guatemala
Runaway software tycoon arrested
Police in Belize are ready to meet McAfee at the airport if he's deported, spokesman Raphael Martinez said.
Authorities there have said they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull.
Under Belize law, McAfee can be held for 48 hours without charges, Martinez said.
But McAfee's fight to stay in Guatemala isn't over.
His attorneys said they filed a request for an injunction with Guatemala's Supreme Court.
Standing outside the police hospital as ambulance lights flashed nearby, attorney Karla Paz said officials had unjustly rejected McAfee's petition without weighing the evidence.
"Due process has been violated. The right to defense has not been respected," she said.

After weeks in hiding, anti-virus software company founder emerged publicly Tuesday in Guatemala's capital, hundreds of miles from the Caribbean island in Belize where his next-door neighbor was found dead.
McAfee requested asylum in Guatemala, arguing that he left Belize to escape police persecution.
But Guatemalan authorities found there was no basis for his asylum request, presidential spokesman Francisco Cuevas said Thursday.
McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008.
On November 9, he told police someone poisoned his four dogs there. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, according to a former girlfriend.
The dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between the two neighbors.
Two days after the dogs were poisoned, Faull was found fatally shot in the head.
McAfee has said he had nothing to do with Faull's death, and Belize authorities are out to get him because he refused to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier.
Belize police say they only want to talk with McAfee.
"He's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad," Martinez, the police spokesman, said earlier this week, "and we just believe he should, if he's innocent as he's saying he is, he should bring in his lawyer, and let's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let's move on."

Mystery masterpiece revealed as Rembrandt self-portrait
By Bryony Jones, CNN
updated 2:40 PM EDT, Mon March 18, 2013
A painting donated to Britain's National Trust three years ago has been identified as a self-portrait of Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn.
The picture was originally believed to have been painted by a pupil or follower of Rembrandt, but X-rays and analysis of the techniques used show it to be by the master himself.
The picture is on display at the National Trust's Buckland Abbey in Devon, southwest England, and will be sent for further tests and cleaning later this year.
The re-attribution of the work, by Rembrandt scholar Ernst van de Wetering, means it is now worth more than $30 million -- but the National Trust cannot sell it.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Painting was donated to the National Trust in 2010, and put on display at Buckland Abbey
Work was originally identified as being by a follower of Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn
New tests reveal the portrait, which shows Rembrandt at the age of 29, is by the artist himself
Re-attribution means the painting is now worth more than $30 million -- but it cannot be sold
London (CNN) -- A mystery portrait donated to a British heritage charity as part of a mixed lot of paintings has been identified as a work by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn -- worth more than $30 million.
The picture, dated 1635, shows the then 29-year-old artist in a black velvet cape and hat decorated with outsized ostrich feathers. It was given to the National Trust in 2010, along with four other artworks.
At the time it was thought to have been painted by one of Rembrandt's pupils, but new tests and research by leading Rembrandt scholar Ernst van de Wetering have shown it is more likely to be by the teacher himself.
"Over the years, it has gone back and forward," David Taylor, the National Trust's curator of paintings and sculpture, told CNN. "Decades ago it was thought to be a Rembrandt, and then the experts said no, that it was by someone in his studio instead."
Van de Wetering, chairman of the Rembrandt Research Project, said the painting was last examined in 1968, and that in the intervening years "we have gathered far more knowledge about Rembrandt's self-portraits and the fluctuations in his style."
He said that X-ray analysis, along with "newly found circumstantial evidence remarkably increased the likelihood that the painting was by Rembrandt himself," and that a recent close look at the picture had confirmed those suspicions.
We never dared think that it might actually be an original; many of our visitors will have just passed by itJez McDermott, National Trust
The painting was given to the Trust by the estate of Edna, Lady Samuel of Wych Cross, whose late husband Harold, Lord Samuel of Wych Cross was a keen art collector and philanthropist.
"It was part of a very generous gift, of five top-notch paintings," Taylor explained. As well as the Rembrandt portrait, the donation also included two peasant scenes and two maritime scenes.
But while the Trust recognized that the portrait was a high-quality work, it was not put on display at Buckland Abbey, in Devon, southwest England, immediately.
"It was in storage at first," explained Taylor. "Though not because it was unloved, more because we were waiting for the right place for it -- we wanted to get the display right."
"It's amazing to think we might have had an actual Rembrandt hanging here on the walls at Buckland Abbey for the past couple of years," Jez McDermott, property manager at Buckland Abbey, said in a statement.
"We never dared think that it might actually be an original, and many of our visitors will have just passed by it, in what is sure to be a real contrast to the attention it is now going to receive."
The self-portrait, the only Rembrandt in the National Trust's huge collection of 13,500 paintings, will remain on display at Buckland Abbey until the end of the tourist season -- where it is expected to attract plenty of visitors -- and will then be sent for further tests to help confirm its new identity.
"It will undergo a full clean, and technical analysis," said Taylor. "It is painted on a beech panel, so dendrochronology [tree ring dating] will allow us to date the panel, and it will be X-rayed to check for under-drawings.
"The paint will be analyzed, so we can see if the pigments match those used by Rembrandt, and when it comes back to us in the new year, we should have the final confirmation."

Hagel: Most civilian Defense workers can return next week
By Barbara Starr, CNN Pentagon Correspondent and Mayra Cuevas
updated 11:26 AM EDT, Sun October 6, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hagel: "I expect us to be able to significantly reduce -- but not eliminate -- civilian furloughs"
Pentagon and Justice Department lawyers consulted on decision, Hagel says
Hours earlier, House passed bill to restore back pay to furloughed workers
Obama has signaled he would sign such a back-pay measure
Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Saturday that "most [Department of Defense] civilians placed on emergency furlough during the government shutdown will be asked to return to work beginning next week."
Under Secretary of Defense Robert F. Hale said close to 90% of the 350,000 members of the civilian workforce will be called back.
"My guess is that we will bring most of them back and no more than a few tens of thousands will remain on furlough. And it may be substantially less than that," said Hale.
The ongoing government shutdown left more than 800,000 workers furloughed since Tuesday.
Cruz promised Republican victory in shutdown fight
Hagel said Pentagon and Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys concluded that the law allows the DOD to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.
"We immediately began working with the Department of Justice on how to implement it," said Hale, "and the Department expressed the opinion that the law does not permit a blanket recall of all DOD civilians. The Department of Justice did say that we could undertake a careful review of civilians who support members of the armed forces and determine who to recall. Needless to say, this is a difficult process and a very time consuming one."
Hale said officials established a series of categories for civilians who will return to work and those who will not. The first group to return will be "accepted civilians, the ones that are working right now connected to military operations and the safety of life and property."
Obama blames Boehner for ongoing shutdown
"We will recall a category of civilians who provide ongoing support to military members on an ongoing basis like health care, family programs, training and maintenance and commissaries. We will also recall a second category of civilians whose work, if interrupted by a lapse for a substantial period, could cause future problems for military members. Falling in this category is acquisitions, program oversight, contract logistics, financial management, supply chain management," said Hale.
The group that will not be recalled from furlough includes staff who are "less directly related to military members," said Hale. Those that will not be recalled include some of the Information staff, some of the legislative and public affairs staff, the deputy chief management officer staff, auditors and staff working in non-DOD activities.
House passes measure to bring military chaplains back to work
"Because of the letter of the law and the advice from the DOJ we had to identify those with the less direct effect on military members," said Hale.
Just hours before the announcement, the House passed a bill providing back pay to federal workers who were furloughed.
It's unclear when the Senate might vote on the bill.
On Friday, the White House said the president would sign such a measure.
Speaker John Boehner and GOP House leadership held the vote as part of a strategy to pass piecemeal spending legislation that addresses the issues brought up by the shutdown.
Although Democrats oppose the incremental approach, saying it amounts to conservatives choosing to fund programs and services they like, the bill passed with strong bipartisan support.
Retroactive pay is provided under the bill, but federal workers can't expect paychecks until after the government shutdown ends and Congress reaches a resolution on the budget.
Hagel's announcement guarantees that many of the Defense Department workers no longer have to wait on Congress in order to go back to work.

CQ Profile: Gray Davis CQ Profile: Dan Lungren Stuart Rothenberg on California governor's race COMMUNITY
Post your opinions on the November races
Davis leads California governor's race
Outcome could be crucial to 2000 redistricting By Jennifer Auther/CNN
LOS ANGELES (October 22) -- As Republican Gov. Pete Wilson steps down, California may just elect a Democrat to succeed him.
It is the highest stakes governor's race in the country, with the man seemingly in the catbird's seat taking a page from President Bill Clinton's playbook.
"My most important priority is to restore our schools to greatness," said Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis. Vice President Gore stumped for Davis
in September
Both Davis and Republican State Attorney General Dan Lungren are career California politicians.
Each projects spending about $33 million on the race.
Initially, pundits worried Davis would be hurt by his own "gray" image. But their worry may have been misplaced.
Davis has enjoyed a steady lead in public polls, between six and eight percentage points, since the primary.
"Boring is back! Boring might even be beautiful!" said Davis, during a campaign appearance with Vice President Al Gore. Davis is a Democrat who passionately supports legal abortion. But his conservative views on some issues moderate his image as a diehard liberal who for years worked for Jerry Brown.
"I would be very tight with your tax dollars, I would be passionate about education, I would be committed to the environment, and I would be death on violent crime!" Davis said during an October 15 debate.
Not too long ago, Lungren, the Republican nominee, was hailed as "The Great Right Hope."
"I was proud, while I was in Congress to be the single strongest supporter of Ronald Reagan's agenda," Lungren says.
Lungren is running on a "remain-tough-on-crime" platform, even though he has been criticized for failing to vigorously enforce California's assault weapons ban.
Lungren debated Davis earlier this month
"We've had, I think 18,000 or more, maybe it's up to 19,000 such guns taken off the street," Lungren says.
National conservatives hope Lungren, who opposes legal abortions and supports less government and fewer taxes, can succeed outgoing Republican Gov. Wilson.
Davis tweaked Lungren in one debate: "Dan, when are you going to get with the program? Join Pete Wilson and I and support a permanent ban on new, offshore drilling?"
But Lungren has avoided aligning himself with Wilson, who supported hot-button ballot measures such as banning affirmative action and halting basic aid to illegal immigrants.
Lungren and Davis must navigate California's ethnically diverse electorate.
Both are tailoring the message, and running Spanish-language TV spots.
A recent poll shows Davis has better than a 3-to-1 edge over Lungren among Latino voters.
"I think the Republicans have had a problem with Latino votes going back to the 1988 fiasco in Orange County, where the Orange County Republican Party hired uniformed guards to stand at polling places, at the legal limit away from the polling stations, but with signs that 'Only citizens can vote,'" said Prof. Sheldon Kemieniecki of the University of Southern California.
Lungren apparently hopes to offset that, touting his Catholic upbringing and using the Monica Lewinsky scandal to discuss character issues.
"My gut tells me that it will discourage the Democratic voter, and that that will be a greater impact on the campaign than encouraging the Republicans," Lungren said.
But according to the polls, neither candidate has captured a convincing majority.
The outcome of the race for governor of California remains in the hands of a shrinking number of undecided voters. Voter turnout also continues to be a big factor.
Meantime, media coverage is scant, rendering five other gubernatorial candidates all but invisible.
They are drowned out by a Lungren-Davis, final-quarter media blitz.
A Davis ad declares, "Davis supports a ban on new, offshore oil drilling. Lungren won't."
An anti-crime ad for Lungren declares, "As attorney general, Dan Lungren enforced the death penalty. He championed three strikes, Megan's law and 10-20 life."
Democrats control both houses of the California legislature. Only a Lungren win would ensure a GOP voice in redistricting California's large bloc of congressional seats after the 2000 election.
"Whatever is done has to be done in a fair and objective manner," Davis says. The thought makes Lungren shudder. Asked what happens in redistricting if Davis wins, Lungren says, "Oh, a repeat of what happened under Jerry Brown, a gerrymander. Only in this case, because we have so many more people in California and more representatives, it could mean the turnover of 10 to 12 seats."
It is enough to turn all eyes to California, come November 3.
