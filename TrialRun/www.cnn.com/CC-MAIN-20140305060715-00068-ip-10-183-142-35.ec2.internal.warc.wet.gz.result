Emergency Supreme Court appeal filed in Ohio voters caseStory Highlights Earlier ruling ordered list of newly registered Ohio voters with mismatched data Ohio secretary of state asks U.S. high court to block that ruling Republican Party contends voter fraud could help swing state towards Obama Ruling called Ohio system "virtually useless" in trying to combat fraud Next Article in Politics » WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ohio's secretary of state on Thursday filed an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in an ongoing dispute over verifying the identities of the state's newly registered voters. Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner filed the emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeal, from Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner -- a Democrat -- and other election officials follows a Tuesday ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati that sided with the state GOP. The ruling ordered Brunner to create a system by Friday to provide a list of newly registered voters whose Social Security numbers or driver's license numbers do not match their names. The state Republican Party contends there is widespread voter fraud in Ohio -- a crucial battleground state for the 2008 presidential election -- and that Brunner "turned off" its process for verifying voter registrations while allowing Ohioans to cast ballots on the same day they registered. State GOP Chairman Bob Bennett has accused Brunner of concealing fraudulent voter registrations in hopes of swinging the state to Sen. Barack Obama. Brunner's office has acknowledged that preliminary information provided by about 200,000 registered voters may not match up. Brunner said Tuesday she had prepared for the appeals court's "possible adverse decision" ahead of time by announcing plans to "further improve the statewide voter registration database."

The appeals court opinion called Ohio's current system "virtually useless" and said it does "nothing to address the anti-fraud objective." It was unclear when the high court might rule. Brunner is asking the justices to stay the lower court ruling ordering setup of the new system. The matter would go first to Justice John Paul Stevens, who is likely to refer it to the full court.

Toys banned in some California fast food restaurants By Sara Bonisteel, Special to CNN About a dozen fast food restaurants in unincorporated areas of Silicon Valley are affected by the ordinance. STORY HIGHLIGHTSOrdinance limits toys on items over 200 calories or more than 480 milligrams of sodiumToys also banned in meals with more than 485 calories.Decision has angered the California Restaurant AssociationPoll says 80 percent of residents don't think toy issue is important

Santa Clara County
Health and Fitness
(CNN) -- A California county on Tuesday became the first in the nation to ban toys from fast food kids' meals high in calories, fat, salt and sugar. Santa Clara County supervisors voted 3-2 to ban the plastic goodies as promotions in meals with more than 485 calories. County supervisor Ken Yeager said Tuesday that the ordinance "prevents restaurants from preying on children's love of toys to peddle high-calorie, high-fat, high-sodium kids' meals," and would help fight childhood obesity. "This ordinance breaks the link between unhealthy food and prizes," Yeager said. "Under this ordinance, restaurants are still permitted to give out toys. This ordinance merely imposes very specific, common-sense nutrition standards for children's meals that are linked to these incentives." The ordinance will ban restaurants from giving away toys with meals that have more than 485 calories, more than 600 milligrams of sodium, more than 35 percent of total calories from fat or more than 10 percent of calories from added sugar. It would also limit toy giveaways on single food items with more than 200 calories or more than 480 milligrams of sodium. But the decision, which affects about a dozen fast food restaurants in unincorporated areas of Silicon Valley, has angered the California Restaurant Association, which fought the proposal with ads in local newspapers. One asks "Who Made Politicians the Toy Police?" and shows a child in handcuffs in front of a cop. KGO: County bans kids' meal toys The group commissioned a poll of local residents that found 80 percent didn't think the toy issue was an important one. "From our perspective, we were echoing what our customers had to say. Obviously we felt that this proposal was excessive and I think purposely provocative," said Daniel Conway, the association's director of public affairs. Conway said the association was disappointed local officials didn't come to them before creating the ordinance. "We try to proactively engage with policy makers at the local level, the state level and the federal level," Conway said. "At the national level, our industry just played a critical role in passing a national menu labeling standard, so that now customers in many restaurants will be able to have in front of them the exact nutritional content of the various menu items." Yeager said at a press conference Tuesday that he hopes the ordinance will spark other counties and states to pass similar legislation. Restaurants will have a 90-day grace period beginning May 11 before the ordinance goes into effect.

What GOP must do if health care law overturned By Ford C. O'Connell, Special to CNN
updated 9:19 AM EDT, Fri April 6, 2012
Tea Party members protesting President Obama's health care law outside the Supreme Court on March 27.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Supreme Court is deliberating on President Obama's Affordable Care Act
Ford C. O'Connell: If the law is struck down, GOP must be ready to present an alternative
He says there is no doubt that health care will be a highly volatile issue in this election year
O'Connell: Republicans should offer a free-market approach to health care reform
Editor's note: Ford C. O'Connell, a Republican strategist who worked on the 2008 McCain-Palin presidential campaign, is chairman of CivicForumPAC, an organization that promotes conservative activism. He has appeared as a guest commentator on CNN, Fox News and other TV networks.
(CNN) -- No one will know until June how the Supreme Court will rule on President Obama's Affordable Care Act. What we do know is there are three possible outcomes -- the law is upheld, struck down or struck down in part -- and Republicans must be prepared for each.
If the law, also known as "ObamaCare," is struck down -- in whole or in part -- and the GOP is not prepared, it could find itself on the losing end of a vicious battle that could lead to four more years of Democratic control of the White House and perhaps Congress as well.
On Monday, the president for the first time commented publicly on the Supreme Court's deliberations. He warned the court about "judicial activism" and "a lack of judicial restraint" -- something Republicans have said they abhor. And he cautioned the "unelected group of people" -- the justices on the court -- against "overturn[ing] a duly constituted and passed law."
Ford C. O'Connell
He walked back those comments after critics, including even liberal columnist Ruth Marcus, took issue with them.
But the message was clear. The president may say he is confident the court will uphold the law, but it seems he's not entirely optimistic.
CNN Explains: Health care reform
And if the law is overturned, we can count on the president to raise the issue on the campaign trail. It's a reasonable strategy.
Plus, "relitigating" the court decision would be better for him than to run on issues such as unemployment rate, the state of the economy or the price of gas, which he hasn't handled well. That leaves the Supreme Court.
Although it may be hard to rouse conservatives to action right now since they don't know how the court will rule, it's better to be ready than not. If the law is overturned, they will need to come up with a comprehensive alternative. They can take some time to hash out the details by engaging the public on the issue. They can start by telling voters, in the words of the Cato scholar Doug Bandow, that "ObamaCare represents extraordinary federal overreach, a bid to legislate well beyond Congress' constitutional powers."
Republicans should offer a free-market approach that ends tax-favored treatment of workplace coverage; encourages competition, even across state lines; promotes consumer choice; and somehow addresses those with pre-existing conditions. In many ways, it would mirror portions of what Mitt Romney began to outline in a recent USA Today op-ed.
The Republican plan should seek to repair what is wrong with the health care law but deal respectfully with popular provisions, such as the one that allows young adults to stay on their parents' plans into their mid-20s.
They also must force insurance companies to explain why they are hesitant to provide coverage for those with pre-existing conditions without an individual mandate. Voters will want to hear something from Republicans that indicates they know, care and want to deal with this problem.
For most Americans, health care is like plumbing: They know they need it; they don't truly know how it works, but they definitely know when it's not working. And they sense now health care is not working, and the health care law -- flawed though it may be -- represents a legitimate attempt to fix it.
There is no doubt health care will remain a highly volatile issue in this election year. If ObamaCare is rejected by the court, it would present a huge opportunity for Republicans. They could look like problem-solvers by coming up with a smart proposal that takes the best ideas from the other side. And if they can message it properly, they'll be in a sweet spot.

Venezuela assembly vote has key implications
By CNN Staff
updated 2:57 PM EST, Sat January 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Venezuelan lawmakers reelect Diosdado Cabello as National Assembly president
Cabello could play a key role if the health of Hugo Chavez does not improve
Chavez is said to be "fighting for his health"
(CNN) -- Venezuelan lawmakers on Saturday reelected Diosdado Cabello as president of the country's National Assembly, a key post in the country's political future as President Hugo Chavez's health is uncertain.
Electing a leader for the National Assembly is usually an event of local interest only, but this year the importance of the vote was magnified because the winner could serve as interim president if Chavez does not survive or is incapacitated.
Chavez has said he wants Vice President Nicolas Maduro to be his successor, and there are reports of tensions among Chavez's allies between factions backing the Cabello and those backing Maduro.
The reelection of Cabello by Chavez's majority party confirmed that despite any tensions, there were no efforts to marginalize his political standing.

Chavez, 58, has not been seen in public since arriving in Cuba for his fourth cancer operation more than three weeks ago, which has fueled speculation that his health is worse than the government is letting on.
Chavez absence sparks succession talk
Maduro said Friday that Chavez is "fighting for his health."
4 scenarios for Venezuela in light of Chavez's health
What happens if Chavez doesn't return?
The president's illness has cast doubt on whether he will be able to be inaugurated next week for his fourth term. There is debate over what the constitution requires for a president to take the oath of office in this circumstance.
If Chavez is unable to be sworn in before lawmakers on January 10 as scheduled, the constitution says Chavez can do so before the country's Supreme Court. But the wording of the constitution isn't clear on whether the inauguration before the Supreme Court must happen January 10, whether it must occur inside the country, and who should run Venezuela in the meantime.
Maduro said the government believes that a swearing in before the Supreme Court can happen at a later date, and hinted that Chavez would remain president after the 10th because he was reelected in October.
Chavez political opponents say a failure to swear in next weeks signifies that the president is permanently absent from his post, and that the national assembly president should take interim control while new elections are called in 30 days.
Maduro slammed the opposition for what he said was trying to take advantage of the situation and steal power.

Damascus bomb suggests insider intel
Syrian civil war stokes violence in Iraq
Damascus bombing spurs anger at U.S.
The group said an improvised explosive device detonated near a police headquarters in Damascus, injuring a number of people, including children.
A giant plume of thick, gray smoke rose over central Damascus, hanging over the skyline. It was not immediately known if there were any fatalities.
According to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, four people, including a 10-year-old child, were killed, and more than two dozen wounded in a series of bomb blasts in Damascus
Two of the explosive devices were planted on bicycles, SANA said, blaming the violence on terrorists.
Hezbollah and Syria
Hezbollah has threatened to intervene further in Syria if there is any threat that the regime could fall to the United States, Israel or extremists, the Lebanese militant group said.
The radical Shiite group, which the United States and Israel call a terrorist organization, has said it is in Syria only to protect Lebanese in the country and to protect holy Shiite shrines from the warfare.
But reports emerged months ago that Hezbollah fighters are battling Syrian rebels near the Lebanese border.
On Tuesday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group could step up its presence in Syria and issued an ominous warning to opposition members backed by foreigners who may try to overthrow al-Assad's regime.
"Syria has real friends in the region and the world. And they will never allow Syria to fall to the hands of the United States, Israel or extremist groups. They will never allow it. You may ask how will this happen. The details will come later," Nasrallah said.
Sectarian strife has been a factor in the civil strife.
The majority of the country is Sunni Muslim; al-Assad's family is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
The Hezbollah leader expressed concern that some Sunni extremists may try to destroy holy Shiite shrines in Syria. While such shrines are highly revered by Shiites, a number of Sunni radicals believe they amount to sacrilege.
One of the most notable shrines is the Sayida Zeinab, which Shiites believe houses the tomb of the Prophet Mohammed's granddaughter, Zeinab. It's located about 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the Syrian capital.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addresses supporters in September 2012.
"Some extremist groups plan to execute their threats with regards to (Sayida Zeinab), and if such a crime were to take place, it will carry with it grave consequences," Nasrallah said.
But the Syrian National Coalition, an umbrella opposition group, dismissed the Hezbollah leader's claims.
"Only the Syrians are responsible to defend and protect their cities and their holy shrines. We don't need the regime militias or Hezbollah fighters to tell us what our duty is," the council said in a statement. "This is our land, our country and our future."
Russia says ships ready to evacuate citizens
The commander of a group of Russian warships said his forces are prepared to evacuate Russian citizens from Syria.
Captain Alexei Komarov said ships due to participate in military exercises off the Syrian coast are standing ready, according to the state-run news agency Itar-Tass.
At least one ship, the Azov, is ported in the Israeli coastal city of Haifa.
There are between 35,000 and 40,000 Russian families in Syria, the Syrian Ambassador to Russia, Riyad Haddad, said last week. He added that only about 100 families have returned to Russia since the start of the civil war. They were relocated in January after being bused out of the country.
A large-scale evacuation from the Syrian coast would be a shift in confidence for Moscow, which has been a staunch ally of Damascus and the al-Assad government.
The Russian military maintains a small base and uses the Syrian port of Tartus for resupply missions.

Judge blocks parts of Texas abortion law
By Dana Ford, CNN
updated 7:11 PM EDT, Mon October 28, 2013
State troopers look on as a group in Austin, Texas, protests a new state abortion law in July. Parts of the law were ruled unconstitutional on Monday, October 28 -- a day before they were scheduled to take effect.
Texas Speaker of the House Joe Straus strikes the gavel after a provisional vote on the abortion measure passed July 9. A lawsuit, filed by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas, alleged that the new abortion limits violate the constitutional rights of women and put unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.
Supporters of the abortion limits react in the gallery of the Texas House after the measure was provisionally approved July 9. The measure seeks to ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandate abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, and tighten usage guidelines for the drug RU486. It would also require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they're providing abortion services.
Opponents of the abortion bill yell outside the Texas House after the bill is provisionally approved.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel strikes down the law's admitting privileges requirement
He delivers a somewhat mixed verdict on medication-induced abortions
"Today's decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life," says Gov. Perry
(CNN) -- A federal judge struck down key parts of a new Texas abortion law, considered among the most restrictive in the country, on Monday, one day before they were scheduled to take effect.
The lawsuit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleged the law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.
The lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services, and usage controls on RU486, a drug that induces abortions.
U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel blocked the law's admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it "places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her."
He also blocked a part of the law that deals with medication-induced abortions but allowed restrictions on the same issue to move forward. Provisions such as requiring strict use under Food and Drug Administration protocol and mandatory follow-up visits remain in place. "The medication-abortion provisions may not be enforced against any physician who determines, in appropriate medical judgment, to perform a medication-abortion using the off-label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother," Yeakel wrote.
Abortion-rights groups say the judge did not go far enough on the issue of medication-induced abortion, believing doctors should be able to use it with few restrictions.
"Today's ruling marks an important victory for Texas women and sends a clear message to lawmakers: it is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal, private decisions away from women and their doctors," Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.
"While this ruling protects access to safe and legal abortion for women in many parts of the state, part of this ruling will make it impossible for many women to access medication abortion, which is safe and effective early in pregnancy," she said.
Conservative groups were disappointed by the ruling.
"Blocking this law only puts vulnerable women in greater danger. We are very disturbed that a judge would partially block a law that is grounded in the latest science and in common sense," said Anna Higgins, director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council.
The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Texas Gov. Rick Perry then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill.
In response to the judge's ruling, Perry vowed he and others will keep fighting.
If the state decides to appeal, the case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
"Today's decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren't exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently," the governor said.
He added: "We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly-elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans."
Separately, the law prohibits abortions past 20 weeks of gestation. That ban takes effect, as scheduled, on Tuesday.
