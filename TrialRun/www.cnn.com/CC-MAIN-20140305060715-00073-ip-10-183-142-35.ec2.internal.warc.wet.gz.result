(CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad confirmed Tuesday that his country has successfully produced low-grade enriched uranium at a level sufficient to power nuclear plants."I officially announce that Iran has joined countries with nuclear technology," Ahmadinejad said.He stressed that Iran's nuclear efforts were for peaceful efforts and that no country should stand in its way."Our nation is a peaceful nation," Ahmadinejad said. (Watch as Ahmadinejad makes his announcement -- 1:59)The enrichment took place Sunday, the president said, adding that "our nuclear activities have been under complete supervision, unprecedented supervisions" by the International Atomic Energy Agency."And today we are interested in operating under IAEA supervision," he said.IAEA inspectors are at a facility in Natanz, but it is unclear whether they witnessed the enrichment process. (Uranium enrichment explainer)Earlier Tuesday, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, head of Iran's atomic energy agency, said that the Natanz facility had enriched uranium at 3.5 percent -- a low-grade level sufficient to run a power plant, but far below the 90 percent required for weapons. The U.N. Security Council has demanded that Iran cease its enrichment activities, but Tehran says that the country has a right to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes.The West, led by the United States, believes that Iran plans to build nuclear weapons. (Watch what Iran's annoucement could mean in the future -- 2:06)"This is another step by the Iranian regime in defiance of the international community," U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters in Washington. "Once again they have chosen the pathway of defiance as opposed to the pathway of cooperation. And we would call upon the Iranian regime to reconsider the steps that it has taken," McCormack said. Earlier, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani told the Kuwait News Agency that Iran's enrichment facility had successfully enriched uranium using a cascade of 164 centrifuges. Last month, Iran said it was producing enriched uranium from a cascade of 20 centrifuges.Thousands of the devices must operate in a series of cascades to yield enough highly enriched uranium needed for a nuclear bomb.After Rafsanjani's announcement, White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters that Iran should be taking steps to renew confidence in its nuclear intentions, instead of moving in the "wrong direction."Iran's new statements would only result in further isolation, and the United States will have to consult with its allies on what the next step in the diplomatic standoff would be, McClellan said. (Watch how Iran poses much different diplomatic obstacles than Iraq -- 2:00)Talks between Iran and Britain, France and Germany stalled in January when Iran began small-scale uranium enrichment and ended its voluntary cooperation with the IAEA, which had been conducting surprise inspections.IAEA Director-General Mohammed ElBaradei plans to visit Iran this week. McCormack said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with ElBaradei on Monday, and ElBaradei told her he was going to Iran to convey the message that Tehran needs to abide by the IAEA demands. Rafsanjani said ElBaradei would face "new circumstances" when he arrives but did not elaborate.Rafsanjani said that the attention given by the West had made Iran's nuclear program "extremely complicated," adding that "Iran is very serious about defending its legal rights."Bush administration officials say they are pursuing a diplomatic solution with Iran. They have been fending off questions over a report in this week's issue of The New Yorker that preparations for military strikes on Iran -- possibly including nuclear weapons -- have gone "beyond contingency planning."Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed that report, written by journalist Seymour Hersh, as a trip to "fantasy land.""Let me be clear: The department's policy is the president's policy," Rumsfeld said. "President Bush and America's allies are on a diplomatic track." (Full story) Story Tools

Who will win battle for the new Tunisia?
By Jon Jensen and Tim Hume, CNN
updated 8:27 AM EST, Fri January 11, 2013
Tunis residents walk past graffiti left by rioters on a building housing a controversial art exhibition in the Tunisian capital in June 2012. The graffiti messages read: "God is great,," "Non-believers have no place in Tunisia" and "You are enemies of God."
Tunisian police square off with protesters, including ultra-conservative Salafists, in Intilaka, west of Tunis in June 2012 during a wave of unrest triggered by the art exhibition. Tunisian artist Nadia Jelassi and her installation "Celui qui n'a pas ... (Anyone who has not ... )," which was interpreted by some Salafists as implying traditionally-dressed women should be stoned. Jelassi says the work is about "trying to show two different ways to practice Islam -- one spiritual, and one closed."
As a result of the unrest over the exhibition, Jelassi and a fellow artist face charges of harming public order and morals -- charges that could see them sentenced to up to five years in prison if convicted.
Jelassi says that despite the threats against her, she will continue to express herself through her art. "Freedom of expression is not something we invented, its limits are well known," she told CNN. "But the sacred is something personal, and no one should intervene in that."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Art has become a target for hardline Islamists in Tunisia after the revolution
Salafists rioted last year over an exhibition containing artworks they considered heretical
Tunisian artists and liberals say they will not be cowed by an intolerant minority
Tunisia's moderate Islamist government is attempting to walk a line between the two
Tunis (CNN) -- When artist Nadia Jelassi exhibited work in Tunis last year, she hoped the piece would prove a talking point.
But when ultra-conservative Salafist Muslims took an interest in her installation at a spring arts festival in Tunisia's capital, the reaction was much stronger than she bargained for.
Deeming a number of artworks in the exhibition heretical, Islamist extremists vandalized the gallery, issued death threats to Jelassi and fellow exhibitors, and rioted in the streets in some of the most serious unrest since the 2011 revolution.
Along with fellow artist Mohamed Ben Slama, she now faces charges of harming public order and morals through her work -- charges that could see them sentenced to up to five years in prison if convicted.
Has the revolution changed Tunisia?
"I never imagined this could happen, not even in my worst nightmares," said Jelassi.
The clash highlights growing tensions between liberal and religious forces over the limits on free speech, as they jostle to define the identity of the new Tunisia following the ouster of dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.
One of the pieces that triggered the protests was Jelassi's installation "Celui qui n'a pas ... (Anyone who has not ... )," which featured mannequins of traditionally veiled women, positioned amongst a pile of stones, with text written on both the female figures and the stones.
The work, Jelassi told CNN, was about "trying to show two different ways to practice Islam -- one spiritual, and one closed."
But some of the protestors, alerted to the exhibition by postings on social media, interpreted the artwork as implying traditionally dressed women should be stoned.
I never imagined this could happen, not even in my worst nightmaresNadia Jelassi, Tunisian artist
Ben Slama's artwork, which was also singled out by the protesters as indecent, depicted a line of ants emerging from a child's schoolbag to spell the word "Allah."

After festival organizers refused a request from the aggrieved Salafists to remove the offending works from view, thousands of hardliners took to the streets, leaving the walls of the gallery scrawled with graffiti reading: "Non-believers have no place in Tunisia" and "You are enemies of God."
This is not the only flashpoint Tunisia has seen. In late 2011, religious conservatives also protested against a Tunis television station and attacked a theater for playing films deemed un-Islamic, while there have also been reports of conservatives attempting to enforce Islamic dress codes.
The group behind the protests are the Salafists -- ultra-conservative Sunni Muslims who are becoming an increasingly strident political force across the Arab world in the wake of the Arab Spring.
We act in response to provocation, and I consider nudity to be violentSalafist Sheikh Adel Elmi
Having suffered repression under the rule of Ben Ali, they now seek a greater voice in the new Tunisia, pushing to impose a stricter vision of Islam than that championed by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party which runs the interim government.
One Salafi cleric, Sheikh Adel Elmi, told CNN he believed art should promote religious virtue, and he had opposed the exhibition because it contained nudity.
"We are against violence, and for dialogue," he said. "But we act in response to provocation, and I consider nudity to be violent."

But other Tunisians, particularly those of a secular, liberal persuasion, hold a different view of their country's future. While Islam has always been the main religion in Tunisia, politics have long been secular.
I respect them. But they have to respect me and the other people who think differentMounir Letaief, painter from Tunis
Mounir Letaief, a 52-year-old painter from Tunis, says the views of those who value freedom of expression, artistic or otherwise, must also be taken into account as the country attempts to rebuild itself.
"I respect them," Letaief said of the Salafists. "But they have to respect me and the other people who think different."
Tunisia's interim government says it is against censoring art -- but that a red line exists when it comes to blasphemy. A proposal has been tabled to criminalize blasphemy in Tunisia's new constitution, due later this year.
"Even in the most modern societies, there are limits -- whether it's security or religious," Culture Minister Mehdi Mabrouk told CNN. "In order to protect freedoms, we need to set these limits."
Meanwhile, Jelassi is waiting to see what will become of the charges against her, with international groups such as Human Rights Watch calling on Tunisian authorities to drop them.
The charges were being used to stifle the freedom of expression of "artists, journalists, and other citizens who voice criticism of religion," Amna Guellali, a Tunis-based researcher at Human Rights Watch, told CNN.
But Jelassi said she would continue to resist any attempt to impose a new culture of censorship in Tunisia.
"Freedom of expression is not something we invented, its limits are well known," she said. "But the sacred is something personal, and no one should intervene in that."

Facebook's Graph Search, as seen by the angry and amused

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Social media users respond to Facebook's new Graph Search
Some express sarcasm, others worry (again) about their privacy on the network
Twitter users post clever #facebooksearchideas
(CNN) -- Facebook's new "Graph Search" promises to let users sift through the network's vast trove of posts and photos to produce more helpful results.
Need an easy way, for example, to find all your friends who watch "Homeland?" Or all Facebook photos of you posted before 2009? Now you have one.
Could it disrupt online dating?
But not everyone on social media was excited about the new search tool, which will begin rolling out to users soon and (again!) raises privacy concerns. And of course, there was sarcasm aplenty.
Here's a sampling of the conversation.

Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women
By Frida Ghitis, Special to CNN
updated 8:10 AM EST, Thu February 21, 2013
A picture taken on January 26 shows Olympian sprinter Oscar Pistorius with Reeva Steenkamp, his girlfriend, in Johannesburg.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
One Billion Rising mass action is raising awareness of violence against women
Frida Ghitis: Oscar Pistorius faces murder charges in death of his girlfriend
Ghitis says people are taking notice, with the assault on Malala, the death of Nirbhaya Ghitis: The death of Steenkamp is a reminder of the urgency of the cause in helping women
Editor's note: Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review. A former CNN producer and correspondent, she is the author of "The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television." Follow her on Twitter: @FridaGColumns
(CNN) -- On the same day that thousands of women stood up to participate in One Billion Rising, billed as the largest mass action to stop violence against women and girls, the sad news came from South Africa that yet another woman was killed.
The reason we took notice of 30-year-old Reeva Steenkamp's death among so many others killed every day is the shocking news that the man charged with killing her, her boyfriend, is none other than Oscar Pistorius, the athlete known as "Blade Runner," a double amputee whose Olympic feats on prosthetic carbon fiber legs made him an international superstar.
We don't know what the investigation will uncover, but Steenkamp's life is now lost. Coincidentally, the Pistorius case happens around Valentine's Day, the date that Rising activists marked to bring focus on the crisis of violence against women.

Brutal attacks against girls and women have stirred the world's conscience with increasing frequency in recent months.
There is no question that many societies are finally becoming fed up with the much-too-common practice of attacking, raping and killing women that goes on in all corners of the world.
The perpetrators of these crimes are invariably cowards, using superior physical force to intimidate or exert power. We have come to know some of their victims.
Remember Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl targeted by the Taliban because she proclaimed that every girl has a right to an education. She has survived and vowed to continue her struggle despite the Taliban's promise they will try to kill her. The contrast in courage could not be starker.
Then there is Nirbhaya, the New Delhi university student who was gang raped in a bus. She died of her horrific injuries, but her assault moved India and the entire world so deeply that her legacy has fueled the battle to stop this violence.
Oscar Pistorius charged with murder
Who was Reeva Steenkamp?
Murder or defense in Pistorius case?
Earlier this month, in a case gruesomely reminiscent of Nirbhaya, 17-year-old Anene Booysen was raped, mutilated and left for dead, in the South African city of Capetown.
Just as Malala has inspired girls to demand an education, Nirbhaya has awakened India to the need for better laws and law enforcement to protect women. And, until the authorities get their act together, fierce Indian girls are learning self-defense. No wonder the Billion Rising celebrations have been such a hit all over India.
Organizers say "Risings" are taking place in 203 countries. If true, that means women in a majority of countries on Earth could heed the call to stand, and to dance. Yes, to dance as a sign of "solidarity, purpose and energy" to "shake the world."
A global push to end violence with song and dance
Amid the celebration, however, it's important to keep in mind what the occasion marks. According to U.N. statistics, one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime, including beating, rape or assault, making such violence a more prevalent problem than AIDS, malaria or any other disease. It means 1 billion women alive at this moment will become part of that statistic, hence the One Billion Rising.
Women used to keep their assaults quiet, out of shame or fear of being ostracized. But less so today. There's Lara Logan, the CBS correspondent attacked by thugs in Cairo's Tahrir Square while covering the Egyptian revolution, one of countless women assaulted in Egypt by gangs of men. Some female democracy protesters, fighting for their rights, were later subjected to "virginity tests" by the Egyptian military.

The problem has deep roots and far-reaching ramifications. Women have endured the use of rape as a weapon of war, and domestic violence as a tool of control at home.
Domestic violence is one of those old traditions that should have died long ago. A 2012 study by UNICEF found most youngsters in India believe wife-beating is justified. But other surveys found the problem knows no national boundaries. The U.N. says about 14,000 Russian women die every year from domestic violence.
In some countries, women are subjected to violence as retaliation for other family members' or their own perceived offenses in so-called "honor killings."
In war zones, fighters rape women to humiliate their enemies, to perpetrate "ethnic cleansing" and to force people to leave. An incredible 92% of Liberian women in one study said they had been raped in that country's war. As you read this, women are being raped in Syria, in the Congo and in other countries where wars rage. After the violation, many of them will be rejected by their families.
Violence against women tends to go hand in hand with lack of equality. It also is a sign of a malfunctioning society. It is a stubborn problem, but one that responds to measures, such as those just approved after a perplexing political battle in the United States.
As the world changes, as countries emerge from poverty and people fight for their rights, we can look to the level of violence against women as one of the gauges of their success. The Arab Human Development Reports of 2002 and 2005 said the low status of women is one of the reasons Arab countries had stagnated, calling the rise of women "a prerequisite for an Arab renaissance."
Pistorius' South Africa, a country with a storied history in the fight for racial equality, has a disturbing record of violence against women.
Around the world, the awareness and determination of women to stand up to violence are a major step forward. But tragedies such as the killing of Steenkamp in South Africa, one of countless occurring just today, are a reminder of the urgency of the cause.
Any country, any society that wants to move forward and earn a place of honor among the nations must make it a priority to teach men from the earliest age that violence against women in any form is unacceptable, and those who hurt or intimidate women should be punished.

Defense witness criticizes FBI's inaction on Whitey Bulger
By Deborah Feyerick. Kristina Sgueglia and Ross Levitt, CNN
updated 6:46 AM EDT, Wed July 31, 2013
James "Whitey" Bulger, the former head of Boston's Winter Hill Gang, evaded police for 16 years before being arrested with girlfriend Catherine Greig in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. After a lengthy trial, Bulger, seen here in his booking photo from June 23, 2011, has been found guilty on 31 of 32 counts -- including involvement in 11 murders. On November 14, Bulger was given two life sentences plus five years.
James "Whitey" Bulger, the reputed former head of Boston's Winter Hill Gang, evaded police for 16 years before being arrested with girlfriend Catherine Greig in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. Bulger seen here in a 1984 FBI photo.
According to prosecutors, Bulger's crew learned that a bookie named Richard Castucci was cooperating with the government, and John Martorano was sent to kill him. Castucci was shot in the head and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his car. Steve "The Rifleman" Flemmi, left, and bookie Dick O'Brien in one of several surveillance photographs entered into evidence in the Bulger trial. Flemmi, Bulger's partner, would meet O'Brien to collect thousands of dollars in "rent" every month.
Bulger is accused of murdering Flemmi's stepdaughter, Deborah Hussey, in 1985 because she became a liability.
Flemmi met Debra Davis at a jewelry store, and the couple dated for more than seven years. In 1981, Bulger is said to have killed Davis because she knew that Flemmi was an informant.
Dr. Ann Marie Mires, a Massachusetts state forensic anthropologist, was brought in to show photos of Bulger's alleged victims, including Debra Davis. Because Davis' body was put into bags, almost all of her remains were recovered. Even some of her hair was preserved.

Bulger was the godfather to John Martorano's first son. Martorano has admitted to 20 killings as part of Boston's Winter Hill Gang and is the government's star witness against Bulger.
In 2008, John Martorano testified against former FBI agent John Connolly, who was accused of leaking sensitive information about former gambling executive John Callahan. Martorano testified that he shot his friend Callahan on Bulger's orders in 1982.
John Callahan was an organized crime associate of the Winter Hill Gang and former president of World Jai Alai. Prosecutors allege Bulger ordered a hit on Callahan after he learned he would be cooperating with the feds on the high-profile murder of an Oklahoma businessman, Roger Wheeler. Bulger is accused in the slaying of Wheeler, who was gunned down outside a country club in Oklahoma in 1981.
Joe Notorangeli was gunned down by the Winter Hill gang in 1973, according to Martorano.
John Connolly was convicted of second-degree murder in the slaying of Callahan and received a 40-year sentence in 2009.
Former FBI supervisor John Morris testified at Bulger's trial on Friday, June 28, saying that he provided information to Bulger in exchange for money and gifts. Here, Morris testifies during the John Connolly murder trial in Miami in 2008.
Bulger's girlfriend, Catherine Greig, was sentenced to eight years in federal prison in 2012 for identity fraud and helping the reputed mob boss avoid capture for 16 years.
J.W. Carney, Bulger's defense attorney, arrives at the U.S. Federal Courthouse for the start of Bulger's trial in Boston on Wednesday, June 12.
This undated surveillance photo released on Monday, July 8, by the U.S. Attorney's Office at federal court in Boston shows Bulger, left, with his former right-hand man, Kevin Weeks. Weeks took the witness stand at Bulger's racketeering trial and described a double slaying, multiple extortions and drug dealing.

Kevin Weeks leaves the courthouse on Monday, July 8, after testifying in graphic detail about how Bulger killed Arthur "Bucky" Barrett, Joey McIntyre and Deborah Hussey.
The remains of Thomas King, former member of the Winter Hill Gang, was found in late 2000. A bulletproof vest, a navy suit, driving gloves and a claddagh ring were found among the remains. Martorano, one of Bulger's hitmen, testified that he himself had shot King in the back of the head.
The body of Stephen Rakes was found on Wednesday, July 17, in Lincoln, Massachusetts, west of Boston. Rakes was scheduled to be a witness for the prosecution before he was dropped from the list.
Trying to show a softer, lighter side of Bulger, his defense lawyers have released photos that they expect to show the jury should he decide to testify.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Former FBI agent says he wanted Bulger cut off, but there was nothing he could do
The prosecutor uses the former agent's book to challenge his version of events
The defense attorney's request for sequestration is denied
Bulger is accused of participating in 19 murders and faces other charges
Boston (CNN) -- An FBI official assigned to Boston to clean up corruption in the 1980s testified Tuesday he was overruled by his superiors when he suggested decades ago that James "Whitey" Bulger be shut down as an FBI informant.
"They didn't do it. I didn't like it, but there was nothing I could do about it," said Robert Fitzpatrick, the former assistant special-agent-in-charge of the Boston office, who testified his bosses at FBI headquarters in Washington "felt Bulger was the person who was going to bring down the Mafia."
Prosecutors have charged Bulger with participating in 19 murders in a 32-count indictment that also accuses the alleged Boston Irish mob boss of racketeering, money laundering, and extortion during some two decades.
Defense witness testifies Bulger didn't seem much of an informant
During that time, according to previous testimony from a disgraced former FBI agent, Bulger was also an FBI informant instrumental in the takedown of the New England Mafia, La Cosa Nostra.
Prosecution rests in Bulger trial
'The nail in 'Whitey' Bulger's coffin'
It's been called "the Hub of the Universe," and though Boston isn't at the center of American life the way it was when it received the nickname in the 1800s, it's still a place many American notables call home ... though, in some cases, Boston might wish they didn't. Take Whitey Bulger, for example. The gangster has been found guilty on 31 of 32 counts -- including involvement in 11 murders. His reputation was already well-established: He was the basis for Jack Nicholson's character in the Oscar-winning "The Departed."
Actor Ray Bolger, on the other hand, became best known for playing the Scarecrow in "The Wizard of Oz." He grew up in an Irish Catholic family in a Boston neighborhood called Dorchester and also went on to star in a number of Broadway musicals. He died in Los Angeles in 1987, five days after his 83rd birthday.
Mark Wahlberg, a member of "The Departed" cast, is also a proud son of the city. After rising to fame with Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, he's become an in-demand actor, with performances in "Boogie Nights" (1997), "Three Kings" (1999), "The Italian Job" (2003) and "Ted" (2012). ("Ted" writer/director Seth MacFarlane, incidentally, is from Connecticut.)
Though Ben Affleck was born in California, his family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he was young -- and it was there he met Matt Damon, who lived a few blocks away. The two won Oscars for writing "Good Will Hunting." Affleck is now an Oscar-winning director as well, for "Argo," and Damon is one of Hollywood's biggest stars.
What list of Bostonians would be complete without a Kennedy? John F. Kennedy was born in Brookline, the son of mogul Joseph P. Kennedy and grandson of former Boston mayor John "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald, and represented the area in Congress before becoming a senator and then the 35th president.
Kennedy's grandfather was succeeded as mayor by James Michael Curley, a colorful figure who served four terms in office -- and two stints in jail for corruption. He was wildly popular, especially among Irish-Americans, and almost certainly inspired the protagonist in the novel "The Last Hurrah."
OK, so Larry Bird is actually from French Lick, Indiana. Still, given his impact on the Boston Celtics -- a storied team built by a New Yorker (Red Auerbach) and spurred to greatness by a Louisiana-Californian (Bill Russell) -- Boston is proud to claim the Basketball Hall of Famer. Larry Legend won three NBA MVP awards, three championships, an Olympic gold medal and scored bucketloads of points.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, left, and Nicola Sacco were the defendants in one of the most famous cases in U.S. history, convicted of a South Braintree murder more because of their anarchist beliefs than the evidence. Their execution, in 1927, spawned protests, demonstrations and riots around the world.
MIT grad and Polaroid employee Tom Scholz built a recording studio in his basement. He formed the band Boston and the recordings he made with fellow musicians -- including singer Brad Delp -- eventually became one of the most successful debut albums of all time, best known for the single "More Than a Feeling." Scholz has since gone on to invent the Rockman amplifier.
Former "Simpsons" writer and longtime talk-show host Conan O'Brien was born in Brookline and didn't even leave the area for college -- Harvard, of course. (Could there be something in the Charles River water? Jay Leno and Louis C.K. were also born and/or raised in the area.)
Dick Dale, the "King of the Surf Guitar," was actually born in Boston. He and his family moved to California when he was a teenager, though he incorporated his Lebanese heritage -- including music he heard at Boston-area festivals -- into his fast-paced style, heard on such cuts as "Let's Go Trippin'" and "Misirlou."
Ever wonder who the "Logan" is in Boston's airport? The name belongs to Edward L. Logan, a brigadier general, veterans advocate and politician who grew up in South Boston. A statue of him was unveiled at the airport when it was renamed in 1956.
New Kids on the Block was one of the heartthrob boy bands of the late '80s and early '90s. Jordan Knight, Jonathan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood all hail from the Boston area. The group came off a lengthy hiatus in 2008 and has issued two albums since then.
Led by Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry, Aerosmith has been referred to as "The Bad Boys from Boston." When they got their start in the early 1970s, all five members shared a small apartment in the city. They went on to become one of the best-selling American rock bands, and in 2001 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Longtime TV journalist Barbara Walters was born in Boston. After five decades in broadcast news, Walters has no shortage of major accomplishments to be proud of, including being the first network evening news anchorwoman when she moved to ABC in 1976. Earlier this year she announced that she will retire from television in 2014.
Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, was born in the Bronx but his family moved to the West Indian section of Roxbury, a Boston neighborhood, in the mid-1930s. He has been criticized for controversial and hateful rhetoric, but in 1999 he started preaching a message of racial and religious harmony. His new outlook was said to be the result of a near-death experience during treatments for prostate cancer.
Albert DeSalvo took responsibility for about a dozen murders when he confessed to being the Boston Strangler. He recanted his admissions and was never convicted of any of the killings before his death, but a recent lab test matched him to DNA evidence taken from the body of one of the victims. DeSalvo was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a prison sentence for rape. He was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, across the river from Boston.
Comedian Amy Poehler, a former SNL cast member and the star of the "Parks and Recreation," grew up in Burlington, Massachusetts. In a 2011 commencement speech at Harvard University, she joked: "I graduated from Boston College, which some call 'The Harvard of Boston.'"
Louis C.K. was born in Washington but moved to his father's native Mexico at age 1. When he was 7, his family relocated to suburban Boston. "I grew up in Boston and didn't get the accent, and one of the reasons is that I started in Spanish," he said in a recent issue of Rolling Stone. He is now a stand-up comedian and the writer, director, producer and star of the FX series "Louie."
Donna Summer, who helped define the disco genre of the 1970s, was raised in Boston's Mission Hill neighborhood. Her hits -- including "Hot Stuff," "Bad Girls," "Love to Love You Baby" and "She Works Hard for the Money" -- electrified dance floors and prompted her coronation as America's queen of disco. She died in 2012 at age 63.
"Star Trek" actor Leonard Nimoy grew up in the West End of Boston. Although he took drama classes at Boston College, he never completed his degree. But Nimoy became a household name when he took on the legendary role of the half-Vulcan, half-human Spock in the original "Star Trek" series (1966--1969) and a number of film and television sequels.
Sumner Redstone is the owner of National Amusements, Inc., the parent company of Viacom and CBS Corp. The media magnate was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard University. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in March he was ranked number 267 on the Forbes 400 List of the World's Billionaires.
Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, was born in Peabody, Massachusetts, and resides in Boston. He stepped down as the chairmen and CEO of GE in 2001. The media nicknamed him "Neutron Jack" for his no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners approach to business. In 2007, he made a failed attempt -- with other investors -- to buy the Boston Globe. John Adams, the second president of the United States, was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. A descendant of Plymouth Rock pilgrims, he was a Harvard-educated lawyer and public figure in Boston. He was a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses and served on the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence.
Paul Revere was a silversmith from Boston's oldest residential neighborhood, the North End. He became famous for his role in the American Revolution. In 1775, he embarked on a "midnight ride" to Lexington, Massachusetts, where he informed Samuel Adams and John Hancock that the British were coming to arrest them. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow dramatized the ordeal with the poem "Paul Revere's Ride."

UFC boss: I was shaken down by Bulger
Fitzpatrick, who was in charge of the drug task force in the organized crime squad, said he was not more forceful in pushing to cut off Bulger as an informant because of the FBI's "quasi-military" structure, saying it would have been a "violation of protocol" to take his concerns any higher.
He testified that his recommendation on Bulger came after a 30-minute meeting in which Bulger did most of the talking.
Even though he was the second-highest-ranking agent in Boston at the time, Fitzpatrick played down the scope of his authority, suggesting he was undermined by Bulger's FBI handlers, apparently unaware at the time that they were being paid off by Bulger.
But Fitzpatrick testified Monday that during the 30-minute meeting, Bulger indicated that the FBI wasn't paying him, but that he was paying the FBI. Asked why he didn't investigate the alleged bribery, Fitzpatrick said, "It could just be a pay-off ... no quid pro quo."
Prosecutor Brian Kelly suggested Fitzpatrick was not interested in shutting down a bad informant: "Weren't you more concerned about your own bureaucratic career than rocking the boat?"
Trying to discredit Fitzpatrick's story, Kelly read passages from his book, "Betrayal," in which the former agent recounts events at which he was not present. Kelly accused him of creating "an entire imaginary conversation with James Bulger," and smirked at the notion Fitzgerald "taunted" the reputed crime boss.
Although the book is portrayed as "absolutely true," its copyright page lists it as "fiction." On the stand, Fitzpatrick described it as a "memoir, a recitation of things" he believes happened.
His goal, he said, was to expose corruption in the FBI, which is also, he says, why he resigned: "I didn't want to be part of the corruption."
During cross-examination Tuesday, Fitzpatrick had difficulty remembering his testimony from the previous day.
"Do you have trouble with your memory?" the prosecutor asked.
"Not that I recall," answered Fitzpatrick, drawing some quick laughs from the court.
Bulger's defense attorneys called Fitzpatrick as part of their attempt to highlight corruption within the FBI during the 1970s and '80s.
Another witness testified that rogue FBI agent John Connolly had access to all FBI informant files and therefore to the identities of everyone cooperating with the government.
One of them was alleged Bulger crime associate Brian Halloran. Fitzpatrick previously testified he went to strike force attorneys requesting the Justice Department be more diligent about putting Halloran in witness protection.
Halloran was cooperating with law enforcement and had implicated Bulger in the murder of a wealthy Oklahoma business man. Two days later, Fitzpatrick testified, Halloran was shot to death. Bulger's former associate Kevin Weeks previously testified that Bulger fired a machine gun in the hit, along with another shooter.
Pointing to Judge Mark Wolf's portrait in court, Kelly argued that in 1988, during hearings before Wolf, Fitzpatrick could not recall going to the Justice Department to help get Halloran in witness protection.
The prosecutor also zeroed in on a passage in the memoir in which Fitzpatrick suggests he was present in 2000 when the body of another alleged Bulger victim, John McIntyre, was pulled from the "frozen ground." Despite writing that the image was "etched in my memory," Fitzpatrick couldn't recall whether he was actually there.
Fitzpatrick was not working for the FBI at the time McIntyre's remains were exhumed in 2000.
"You were trying to take credit for something you didn't do," Kelley said.
The prosecution alleges Bulger ordered a hit on McIntyre, a fisherman, after learning that McIntyre was cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation of a shipment of arms Bulger intended to send to the Irish Republican Army on the fishing trawler Valhalla.
McIntyre also tipped authorities to a 36-ton delivery of marijuana on the boat Ramsland in 1984, months before he was killed, prosecutors say.
Developer describes threats in trial
Kelly brandished documents in court that showed Fitzpatrick vouched for rogue FBI agents during the same time he claims he complained about their behavior. Fitzpatrick apparently signed off on glowing FBI evaluations of disgraced and now-jailed Connolly, and even signed off on a recommendation for him to go to a Harvard program.
On redirect questioning, Fitzpatrick defended his book to the jury.
"The book is about the criminal justice system," he said. "In my estimation the criminal justice system failed, it failed during this whole situation. I wanted to bring it to light, not just for the public, for my family."
Fitzpatrick, who is still fighting to receive the full amount of his pension, plans to write another book on this trial, he said in court.
Jury will not be sequestered
Despite a request by the defense, Judge Denise Casper decided Tuesday not to sequester the jury, saying this late in the trial the jury was unprepared, and it could be prejudicial to both sides to have a disgruntled jury.
Defense attorney J.W. Carney previously argued that there has "never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district," saying there has been saturated media coverage and "statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen."
The judge said her initial instructions to the jury have been reinforced "more importantly by my repeatedly advising them that they not pay attention to media accounts." She also said she does not expect a "great amount of coverage during deliberations."
"We have to assume the jurors are following my instructions," she said Tuesday morning.
"I am not inclined to inconvenience these jurors at this juncture," she said, particularly when they have had "no notice" of the potential of sequestration.
The defense has so far called two of its estimated 15 witnesses. It took the prosecution 30 days and 63 witnesses to present its case, which it wrapped up Friday.
