Ahmadinejad: Iran can help secure Iraq, Israel is 'cruel' Story Highlights Iranian president urges U.S. and Britain to reconsider the invasion of Iraq Ahmadinejad on Iran's nuclear ambitions: We do not need a bomb Iranian president says Israel "cannot continue its life"Next Article in World » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- Iran wants "peace and friendship for all," the country's president said Wednesday while again denying Western assertions his nation is pursuing nuclear weapons and trying to destabilize Iraq. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks at the Natanz nuclear facility in April. But Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took a hard line against Israel, calling it "an invader" and saying it "cannot continue its life." Asked if Iran had launched a proxy war in Iraq -- something the U.S. ambassador and top military commander there both asserted this week -- Ahmadinejad said the United States is merely seeking a scapegoat for its failing campaign in Iraq. "Forces have come into Iraq and destroyed the security, and many people are killed," the Iranian president told Britain's ITN during an interview in the garden of the Iranian presidential palace in Tehran. "And there are some claims that may seem very funny and ridiculous. Those who have lots of weaponry and warfare and thousands of soldiers -- if they are defeated, they blame others. There is no way to escape for peace." Iranians do not believe in war and consider it a "last resort," he said. He further claimed that Tehran is a friend of Iraq -- maintaining "good relationships" with the Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish factions -- and "if Iraq is not secure, we are the first country that would be damaged."

He added, "Responsible people should understand this: that Iran is against any sort of insecurity and attacks, and Iraq is able to defend themselves." Watch Ahmadinejad discuss issues affecting his country » During the interview, Ahmadinejad struck a friendly tone toward Britain, saying he regretted that British soldiers have died in Iraq. "We are sorry for your soldiers to be killed. We think peace should exist. Why should there be an invasion so that people will be killed?" he asked. "We want friendship -- friendship to all. We love all nations and all human beings. Anyone who is killed, we are against it." Ahmadinejad urged the United States and Britain to reconsider the invasion of Iraq. The two countries should "correct themselves," he said. If they don't, "the defeat would repeat." The Islamic republic could help improve conditions in Iraq, but first coalition forces must leave, he said. "We can help solve many problems in Iraq. We can help secure Iraq. We can help the attackers leave Iraq if the American government and British government correct themselves." he said. Ahmadinejad has said in the past that Tehran would fill any power vacuum left by a withdrawal of coalition forces in Iraq. The United States has cited the Iranian president's remarks as a reason to continue its efforts in Iraq. As for allegations that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapon, Ahmadinejad said he resents the notion that Iran "has to obey whatever was put to us" and asked why there is no similar furor over American and British nuclear programs. "Our bombs are dangerous, but American bombs are not dangerous?" he asked. When the ITN interviewer asked if he could tour the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, Ahmadinejad chuckled and asked him if he thought the United States or Britain would allow Iran to inspect their nuclear facilities. "We do not need a bomb. We are against bombs, actually. There are many reasons we are against it," he said. "From a political point of view, it's not useful, we think." The United Nations Security Council has so far imposed two rounds of limited sanctions against Iran for the country's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment program. Tehran has insisted the program is meant for peaceful energy production. In regard to Israel, which Ahmadinejad has said should be politically "wiped off the map," the Iranian president said there is a way to deal with the Jewish state without violence. Giving as an example the dissolution of the Soviet Union -- which he said came about "without war" -- Ahmadinejad suggested that "everything would be solved" if the Palestinian people were allowed to vote on their fate. However, his hard-line rhetoric resurfaced when Ahmadinejad said Israel "cannot continue its life." "Israel is an invader and is cruel, and it hasn't got a united public. All other nations are against it," he said. "We do not recognize them. They are attackers and illegal." E-mail to a friend All About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Iran • Israel

Are travel agents making a comeback?Story Highlights Study finds 46 percent of travelers enjoyed using Web to book travel this year Some Web-reliant travelers are shifting to brick-and-mortar travel agent model Travel agents often specialize in certain countries or tours for complex itineraries Despite recession, Expedia had a 22 percent air transaction growth last quarter Next Article in Travel » By Stephanie Chen CNN	(CNN) -- If you've booked travel online, you may have been there. Nancy Cutter, a travel agent in Charlotte, North Carolina, discusses vacation options with a client. Online travel sites flooded with overwhelming options, all claiming the best deals. Extra fees nestled into the fine print amid blaring advertisements. Pounding 16 digits into the telephone after you've booked the wrong flight before finally getting a human voice. A few weeks ago, Darin Kaplan, a tech-savvy 27-year-old California restaurant manager, clicked his mouse hundreds of times, surfing the vast choices offered by online travel booking Web sites like Expedia.com and Orbitz.com to plan his 28th birthday cruise to Mexico before he gave up in frustration. "It's a cut-and-paste experience when you're booking online. None of these sites are going to tell me what I can do with different options," said Kaplan, who uses the Internet for many purchases, including his basketball shorts and music tickets. "Travel agents know what they are talking about. It's more comforting to hand my money to someone who has the knowledge and experience." Some travelers like Kaplan are finding themselves defecting from travel booking sites like Travelocity.com or airline sites like Delta.com. They are going back the travel agent, an industry that many industry experts once thought to be passé with the advent of online booking. Fewer travelers are enjoying using the Web to plan and buy trips, according to a study last week by Forrester Research, a market research company. About 46 percent of U.S. leisure travelers enjoyed using the Internet to book travel this year, down from 53 percent in 2007. Difficult site navigation and presentation on travel company sites and hotel and airline sites are causing a growing number of travelers to shift away from the Web and consider using alternative methods of booking travel.

"People are saying 'I don't understand my options, and I would like to talk to someone who can do all the searching and tell me what's available,' " said Henry Hartevelt, the analyst who wrote the Forrester study. "Major travel agencies have absolutely failed in their responsibility to innovate and think of creative new ways to help their customers shop." In the brick-and-mortar travel agent model, a trained agent meets with the traveler in person or establishes a relationship over the phone. For a fee, they discuss the travel options they have researched. These travel agencies began losing their monopoly on the industry during the late 1990s, when airlines began to sell tickets online and travel giants like Expedia.com exploded onto the scene, quickly gobbling market share by introducing the quick, do-it- yourself model. In 1995, there were 37,000 brick-and-mortar travel agencies, according to the American Society of Travel Agents. Now, only 18,000 exist after many merged or folded. "What the Internet has done is given us a nation that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing," said Bill Maloney, CEO of the American Society of Travel Agents. "How do you know if a hotel is actually a good value or if it's overpriced? You have these online generalists and these individual specialists." Travel agent Nancy Cutter of Court Travel Ltd. in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a half-dozen other agencies across the country say they have experienced a surge in returning clients, who said travel Web sites were confusing and unhelpful. In several instances, brick-and-mortar agents say they were able to offer deals at the same price as, and even undercut, the travel agent models, dispelling the belief that the cheapest rate is online. Travel agents have deals with suppliers that can sometimes enable them to offer lower prices than on the Web. They also have time to cancel tickets for free, compared with some non-refundable tickets sold on the Web. Expedia.com said it recently waived the fee for travelers changing certain flights. "Just because you can go out and buy Turbo Tax doesn't mean it's the best answer for everyone," Cutter said. "Some people will still go to an accountant. Booking travel can get complicated, and it's just not as easy as it looks." Travel agents don't discount the value of online travel agencies, which can be useful for booking simple, short trips, but they say complex itineraries require more expertise from a professional. Many online travel companies agree that an agent may be valuable in planning a detailed honeymoon that includes a tour of vineyards in France or a family excursion to top snorkeling and kangaroo-watching destinations in Australia. "If you're the type of traveler who needs hand-holding up front, then sure, a travel agent would be great, but you can usually find that same information on the Web," said Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline.com, a travel company famous for letting bidders set their own price. He said the agents available by phone at his company can help facilitate a sale and customize cruises for travelers. Online travel companies say they have made functionality improvements on their sites in recent years. For example, Expedia.com, the world's largest online travel agency, offers a tool that can let customers compare seats on an airplane, with ratings on how comfortable a seat is and how much leg room is available. They also have hotel reviews and even Web tours of rooms to help travelers decide. And, research shows that online travel model is poised to grow. Even in a recession, when companies and individuals are scaling back on travel, Expedia.com saw a 22 percent air transaction growth rate in the last quarter. But Susan D. Tanzman of Martin's Travel and Tours in California, who has worked as an agent for 35 years, points out that agents follow up with travelers before and after the trip. If the traveler needs help, the agency can offer assistance. They often work 24 hours a day. JoAnne Kochneff, owner of midsize agency Travel by Gagnon in Michigan, said agents can give the personal attention a site cannot. Kochneff's office provides a homey feel, with agents offering freshly baked cookies for clients who stop by to chat about their trips. "They have personal experience traveling in the area, so they can give you a personal recommendation," said Frances Mosser, 67, of Kentucky, on her reason why she switched to the travel agent model this summer. Mosser and her husband booked a trip to St. Melo in France with a travel agent. The agent helped them devise a way to reduce travel time by taking Ryan Air between countries. "I don't think we could have planned the trip without her," Mosser said.

Obama: GOP relying on fear, frustration instead of offering new ideas By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSObama campaigns for Connecticut Senate candidateTea Party protesters outside complain about federal spendingObama says he understands anger over unemployment, other problems (CNN) -- With Tea Party protesters gathered outside, President Barack Obama said Thursday he understood the anger and frustration in the country but insisted his policies would move the nation forward. Speaking at a fundraiser for Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Connecticut, Obama said Republicans and special interests were spending millions on negative ads against Democrats instead of offering any new ideas or proposals to spur economic recovery and job creation. He noted that Blumenthal's GOP opponent, former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon, had more money than the state attorney general and was spending it on attack ads against him. "I could see how someone who has a background in professional wrestling would think they're right at home in the U.S Senate," Obama joked to the crowd of more than 300 people expected to raise more than $400,000. However, the president said, public service "is not a game," but instead involves "facing serious challenges that require serious leaders." Out on the street, conservative protesters withstood stormy weather to express their concerns with signs criticizing Obama and Blumenthal. Some held Revolutionary War-era flags depicting a coiled snake and the "Don't Tread on Me" slogan, while other placards in the crowd of mostly white, middle-aged demonstrators said "B.O. Stinks," "I am not your ATM," and "Stop Socialism, vote Nov. 2." Some signs referred to Blumenthal's admission earlier in the campaign that he had wrongly claimed to have served in Vietnam during the war. "Obama supports liars," one sign read, while others said "No Blumen' way." Obama said such criticism is part of politics, especially when campaigning against the party in power. "In a political campaign, the easiest thing the other side can do is ride that anger all the way to Election Day, especially when you've got millions of dollars to burn on negative ads," he said, adding that Republicans aren't offering any new ideas or policies, instead saying they'll return to what he called the failed policies of the past. "This is a tough election season," Obama said. "People are hurting and they are understandably frustrated. A lot of them are scared and a lot of them are angry." That dynamic makes it easier to run on a slogan of "cast the bums out," Obama said, adding that "you can't blame folks for feeling that way sometimes." "But it's not a vision for the future," he said.

Maine student born without hands honored for penmanship By Nina Raja, CNN Boy with no hands wins handwriting awardSTORY HIGHLIGHTSFifth grader gets special award from publisherNational contest will now have category named after himMaine boy was born without hands or lower arms (CNN) -- Born without hands and lower arms, fifth-grader Nicholas Maxim received a unique award Monday for his participation in Zaner-Bloser's 20th annual National Handwriting Contest. "We submitted his entry because we felt his penmanship was amazing considering he completes most of his work without using his prostheses," said Cheryl Hasenfus, Readfield Elementary School principal. At those times, Nicholas writes by holding a pen or pencil between his upper arms. On behalf of Zaner-Bloser, a publisher of educational materials, Hasenfus presented a trophy to Nicholas during a school assembly for his excellent penmanship. The school is in Readfield, Maine.

Inspired by his ability, Zaner-Bloser decided to create a new award category in his honor: Nicholas Maxim Special Award for Excellent Penmanship "When our team saw Nicholas' handwriting, we were just amazed," said Zaner-Bloser President Bob Page. "Since we started this contest 20 years ago, we've been pleased to get a great response that increases every year, and Nicholas inspired us to encourage all students to participate." More than 200,000 students are waiting for the results of the competition. Winners will be announced at the International Reading Association Annual Convention on May 10 in Orlando, Florida. Zaner-Bloser estimates that more than 2.5 million students have participated in the contest during its history.

Dutch soccer games canceled in tribute to slain linesman
By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN

A volunteer soccer official (file photo) was allegedly beaten to death by teenage players last Sunday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
All amateur games are canceled this weekend, the Dutch football association says
A minute's silence will be held before professional games in tribute to the linesman
Three teenagers have been charged in the death of the linesman
A Dutch newspaper ad says, "Without respect, no football"
(CNN) -- Amateur football games across the Netherlands have been canceled this weekend in tribute to a volunteer soccer official whose beating death allegedly by teenage players has shocked the country.
A minute's silence also will be observed before all professional games this weekend, the Dutch Football Association, KNVB, said in a statement.
Players and match officials taking part in those games will wear black armbands, it said.
KNVB also has taken out large ads in newspapers with the message, "Without respect, no football."
The ads say that respect is "more than a word" and calls on people to show that they are against violence.
Diego Mendieta's former teammates carry his coffin at the Paraguayan footballer's funeral in Solo, Indonesia. He passed away at the age of 32, dying in hospital after contracting an infection. Mendieta was unable to return home to his wife and children because he was owed four months' wages. Mendieta is mourned by wife Valeriana Alvarez and their children Bele (left) and Gaston.
Mendieta's plight has highlighted the schism in Indonesian football, where two organizations are fighting for control of the game following the creation of a breakaway league. The players' union says 13 clubs are behind in promised salary payments.

Paraguayan player's Indonesian tragedy
The Brazilian city of Sao Paulo has been battling a crime wave, with 100 police officers dying this year -- prompting security concerns ahead of the 2014 World Cup.
The Brazilian government has implemented programs to control violence in shantytowns around the country. Here an officer patrols one of Rio de Janeiro's favelas.
The South American nation's World Cup bid team has announced that $900 million will be spent on security for the soccer tournament as it tries to appease safety concerns.
Brazilians are passionate about football. Here Corinthians supporters cheer their team's players at at the Cumbica International Airport in Sao Paulo before their departure to December's FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.
While the draw for next year's Confederations Cup was taking place, members of the anti-violence group Paz de Rio protested in Sao Paulo against the increase of the murder rate in Brazil.
Brazilian model Adriana Lima was enlisted to help with the draw for the tournament, which is traditionally staged by the World Cup host as a warmup event and features eight nations. Rio's iconic Maracana Stadium is still undergoing renovation, but is expected to be ready for when Brazil's five-time world champions begin their defense of the Confederations Cup title next June.

Brazil boosts World Cup security budget
Bela Guttmann was a Hungarian Jew who transformed the face of modern football. He worked across the world, enjoying huge success in Brazil and Portugal, where he won the European Cup on two occasions with Benfica.
Guttmann took some inspiration from the great Gustav Sebes, the man who coached the "Magnificent Magyars" in the 1950s. Under Sebes, Hungary became the first nation to defeat England on its home soil, winning 6-3 in 1953 before reaching the World Cup final the following year. Striker Ferenc Puskas, who is pictured here training at Craven Cottage, scored twice in that famous Wembley game.
During his time in Brazil with Sao Paulo between 1957 and 1958, Guttmann introduced the 4-2-4 system which Brazil used at the 1958 World Cup. Pele is pictured here celebrating after scoring in Brazil's 5-2 World Cup final win over Sweden in Stockholm.
Guttmann led Benfica to glory in the 1961 European Cup final, beating Barcelona 3-2. After arriving at the club from Porto in 1960, Guttmann immediately fired 20 of his squad before going on to win the Portuguese league title two years in a row.
Benfica faced then five-time winners Real Madrid in the 1962 final in Amsterdam, where Guttmann's side produced a famous 5-3 victory. Puskas scored a first-half hat-trick for Real against his former manager but it was not enough as Eusebio fired the Lisbon side to glory with two second-half goals. Eusebio was brought to Benfica from Mozambique by Guttmann in 1961. Under his guidance Eusebio would go on to greatness, establishing himself as one of the game's most talented players.
When Guttmann left Benfica after a pay dispute following the 1962 European Cup win, legend has it that he left a curse on the club. He is reported to have told the board that they would never win the title again. The following year, Benfica lost 2-1 to AC Milan in the final -- and suffered defeat in four more since then.
Before the 1990 final against AC Milan in Vienna, Eusebio prayed for forgiveness at Guttmann's grave but it did little good as Benfica lost 1-0. That was Benfica's last European Cup final appearance. Many have compared Guttmann with Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho. The two are said to have shared many traits, including their man-management skills, fiery tempers and winning mentality. Mourinho's father, Felix, played against Guttmann's Benfica side, saving a penalty from Eusebio.
Portuguese club Benfica are nicknamed the Eagles and before each home game an eagle flies around the Estadio da Luz.
Despite being under pressure for much of the 2013 Europa League final, Fernando Torres raced clear to fire home in style and Chelsea the lead.
Fernando Torres does his best impression of Usain Bolt after giving Chelsea the lead.
Benfica hit back with 22 minutes remaining when Oscar Cardozo netted from the penalty spot after Cesar Azpilicueta handled inside the penalty area. But with the game looking set for extra time, Branislav Ivanovic popped up at the death to head a dramatic winner and secure victory for Chelsea.
One year on from winning the Champions League, Chelsea's players celebrate with the Europa League trophy.

Bela's Benfica 'curse'
Manchester City was the highest spender when it came to agents' fees, paying out close to $17million. Manager Roberto Mancini was busy in the transfer market, bringing in the likes of Javi Garcia from Benfica.
New Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers brought in $40 million worth of talent in Fabio Borini and Joe Allen in August. The Anfield club has struggled on the pitch however, languishing in 12th place.
Esteban Granero arrived at Queens Park Rangers with the hope of lighting up the Premier League. But the former Real Madrid man has endured a difficult start, with his new team rock bottom and yet to win a game.
Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas was a busy man during the summer transfer window, bringing in the likes of Clint Dempsey and Mousa Dembele from Fulham as well as France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and Belgium's Jan Vertonghen.
Eden Hazard was just one of the big arrivals at Chelsea after arriving from French club Lille in a deal worth over $50 million. The Blues also brought in Brazilian playmaker Oscar and German winger Marko Marin.
When it comes to business, Arsenal is held up as a beacon club by many. It spent wisely once again in pre-season, attracting Germany international Lukas Podolski, Spain's Santi Cazorla and France forward Olivier Giroud.
Robin van Persie was Manchester United's big summer signing after he arrived from Arsenal. United also brough in Shinji Kagawa from Borussia Dortmund and Alex Buttner from Vitesse Arnhem.
Premier League newcomers Southampton spent the least on agents' fees. The Saints spent most of its budget on Gaston Ramirez from Bologna, who cost just over $19 million.
Manchester City - $17m
Liverpool - $13.8m
Queens Park Rangers - $10.9m
Tottenham Hotspur - $10.5m
Chelsea - $10.3m
Arsenal - $8.8m
Manchester United - $5.7m
Southampton - $1m

EPL agents earn millions
The cancellation affects 33,000 amateur games that would have been played over the weekend, according to Dutch public media.
Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old -- all Amsterdam club Nieuw Sloten players -- have been charged by Dutch police following the death of 41-year-old linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen.
Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing in the match for his club, Buitenboys, when the incident occurred in the city of Almere on Sunday. The linesman reportedly fell into a coma after he was beaten. He died the next day.
The Dutch football association said it was encouraging clubs to open their doors and talk to each other about the tragedy.
A Facebook page has been set up to allow players and fans to share their ideas, it said in a statement, and many amateur clubs are gathering people together this weekend to pay tribute to Nieuwenhuizen.
"It is unbelievable that something like this can happen on a football field," said Bert van Oostveen, the association's director of professional football. "These are the volunteers our sport is built on, who we can't do without.
"Without respect, there is no football. This is also why we want to pay attention to this terrible situation. Our thoughts go out to Richard Nieuwenhuizen's relatives."
The football association said it had decided to go ahead with the weekend's professional matches so that fans and players would join together in a moment of remembrance and think about how to prevent such a tragedy recurring.
"The association cannot solve this problem alone. It cannot be solved only on the football field; there is no easy solution. A broad effort is needed, from government, schools, clubs, but certainly also from parents," said Anton Binnenmars, director of amateur football.
Nieuwenhuizen's death resonated across the globe, with FIFA President Sepp Blatter among those extending condolences.
"Football is a mirror of society, and sadly the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game," said Blatter, according to a statement on fifa.com.
"Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr. Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs."
On its website Nieuw Sloten said it was "deeply shocked" by Nieuwenhuizen's death, adding that it would ban for life the players found to be responsible, pull its team from the league and temporarily suspend all operations as a club.
"Violence should not be on the football fields," said a statement on the Nieuw Sloten website.
"And certainly not against referees, linesmen and all those others who volunteer each year to help over a million amateur footballers. We must do everything possible to eliminate these excesses."
Despite a population of 17.5 million, Holland has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years, with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country's professional clubs.

Seize this moment to forge ties with Venezuela
By The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Special to CNN
updated 8:38 AM EST, Fri March 8, 2013
Venezuelans line up to pay their last respects to the late President Hugo Chavez in Caracas on Thursday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jesse Jackson: Chavez's death an opportunity for U.S. and Venezuela to heal relations
He says we have demonized Chavez, but this rhetoric serves no good purpose
Jackson: U.S.-Venezuela bond will be beneficial to both countries, in trade and oil
Jackson will be talking with religious, political leaders to rebuild diplomatic ties
Editor's note: The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a longtime civil rights activist, is the founder and president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and was an aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. (CNN) -- On Thursday night, I returned to Caracas, Venezuela, to participate in the funeral and mourning of Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela from 1999 until his passing this week. Chavez's death has captured the world's attention front and center with renewed vigor and interest.
He first burst onto the world scene with his presidential victory in 1999. Since then, through his fourth re-election in January -- and while he was in Cuba fighting the cancer that would take his life -- his focus was on forging a new socialist Venezuela.
This won many friends and advocates at home and abroad, especially among Venezuela's and the hemisphere's poorest populations. Other world powers demonized Chavez and sought to ostracize him, a la Cuba's Fidel Castro, on a global scale.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson
But I believe peaceful, constructive negotiation should carry the day over isolation and demonization.
That's why I visited Venezuela in 2005, just after the Rev. Pat Robertson called for the assassination of Chavez. He inflamed a chorus of extremist voices in seeking a way to "deal with Chavez."
That type of hot rhetoric serves no productive purpose.
I went to talk with Chavez; I talked with Jewish religious leaders in Venezuela. I talked with Afro-Venezuelans. I learned about the transition taking place from the old banana republic regimes to the new leaders, with new ideas, such as Chavez in Venezuela, Luiz Lula da Silva in Brazil and Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia. I looked not to exploit differences and fuel division, but for common ground.

That's why I went to Iraq to talk with Saddam Hussein in 1990 as he invaded Kuwait and convinced him there was no value in holding hundreds of people from the United States and other countries as "human shields." He released them.
That's why I went to what remained of Yugoslavia amid the flames of war in 1999, to talk with Slobodan Milosevic to persuade him to release the three U.S. soldiers being held hostage. He did.
And that's why I went to Cuba in 1984 -- long under a senseless U.S. blockade -- to talk with Castro and persuade him to release dozens of political prisoners.
In each instance, the U.S. had a no-talk policy with these leaders and nations.
It's been my experience that talking, keeping lines of communication open to friend and foe alike, can reap dividends. Nations cannot always agree, but we can always talk. That does not require a sacrifice of principles or signal weakness.
Paying last respects to Hugo Chavez
Chavez' social media dominance
What is Chavez's economic legacy?
World reacts to Chavez's death I believe in the Gandhi principles, favoring peaceful negotiation over military confrontation. He called the doctrine "satyagraha" -- and explained the "pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and compassion.
"For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth, not by infliction of suffering on the opponent, but on oneself."
It works. In my view, it's always more productive and mutually beneficial to talk things out and not fight things out.
As the world mourns the death of Chavez, it's time to go beyond divisive rhetoric and historical fears that leave all of us in the dark.
Where is our common ground?
We are neighbors; we live in the same hemisphere. There are 200,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. -- including nearly 70 Major League baseball players in 2012, among them Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera.
We are trading partners. Venezuela surpassed Saudi Arabia as the nation with the largest oil reserves in the world, and the U.S. is the largest importer of Venezuelan oil. That oil is four days away, compared with four weeks away in the Middle East. There is a huge potential to expand our market and Venezuela's. And with stronger economic ties comes political stabilization.
It's time to turn crisis into opportunity, to fulfill the unfinished business of realizing to the fullest potential the relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela. Seize this moment to heal the wound and bind the ties.
It won't be easy, but nothing is. And nothing will be accomplished with a no-talk policy.
No doubt, Venezuela's relations with the U.S. have been strained -- diplomatic relations were severed for a time in 2008 when Venezuela accused the U.S. of plotting the overthrow of Chavez. Just last week, days before Chavez died, Vice President Nicolas Maduro expelled two U.S. military officials, accusing the U.S. of trying to destabilize the government.
The good news is that President Barack Obama has sought to restore relations, saying in a statement that the United States "reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with Venezuela's government. ... As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the United States remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
The U.S. is sending an official delegation to Chavez's funeral. And Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have expressed their desire to forge a more positive and productive relationship with Venezuela.
As I meet with political, religious and community leaders in Venezuela, this is the message I bring.
Let's put an end to hot rhetoric, demonization and policies of isolation. It's time to forge a practical, productive relationship that will lead to normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Venezuela.

'Diana, the Hunter' slayings frighten Ciudad Juarez bus drivers, commuters By Rafael Romo, CNN Senior Latin American Affairs Editor
updated 7:10 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two Ciudad Juarez bus drivers were slain last month by an unidentified woman
Shooter reportedly sent e-mails saying the killings were to avenge women raped by drivers
Some drivers, fearful of being shot, have not shown up for work
Commuter: "Of course we're afraid. ... but we still have to get to our destination."
(CNN) -- She calls herself "Diana, the Hunter." Authorities say the elusive woman has killed at least two bus drivers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
According to the Chihuahua state attorney's office, the unidentified woman, with either hair dyed blond or wearing a blond wig, shot and killed a city bus driver identified as Jose Roberto Flores Carrera, 45, on August 28.
Another bus driver, Fredy Zarate Morales, 32, was killed the next day. In both cases, officials say, "Diana, the Hunter" boarded the buses and shot the drivers point blank.
After the second shooting, several media outlets in Ciudad Juarez reported receiving an e-mail from a sender claiming to be the killer. In the e-mail, she calls herself "Diana, the hunter of drivers."
She reportedly says in the e-mails that her motive is retaliation against bus drivers who have raped vulnerable women, especially those who work in the "maquiladoras," or foreign assembly plants (mainly American) on the Mexican side of the border.
"I'm an instrument that will avenge [the attacks against] several women," the e-mail is reported to say. "We seem weak to society, but we're truly not. We're courageous and, if they don't show respect to us, we will make them respect us by our own means. We women of Juarez are strong."
Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman with the Chihuahua state attorney's office, told CNN the end doesn't justify the means.
"Nobody can take justice into their own hands," Sandoval said. "If she was a victim of a bus driver or knows someone in that situation, she has to report it and let authorities do their job."
The Chihuahua state attorney's office released a sketch of the suspect Wednesday and asked for the public's help to catch her.
"The sketch was done after interviewing more than 20 people who witnessed the homicides and who gave us very valuable information for this investigation," authorities said in a statement.
According to local media reports, citing official sources, authorities know the perpetrator is a woman because she yelled at the second victim before shooting him: "You guys think you're real bad, don't you?"
The slayings have terrorized many bus drivers, especially those operating Route 4, also known as the Yellow Route, which serves main thoroughfares and downtown Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million located across the border from El Paso, Texas.
Thirty drivers normally cover the route, but many have decided not to show up for work since the second slaying. Julian Vazquez, a bus driver on the same route, is one of those still behind the wheel, although he admits he's afraid.
"There's only about 50% of us working," Vazquez told CNN. "We're full of fear after learning this person killed two of our colleagues and nobody has any clue."
This situation has left hundreds of riders stranded. Others have been forced to look for transportation alternatives for their daily commute.
"Of course we're afraid," commuter Maria Banuelos, said. "We fear that the driver might be attacked or that I will be in harm's way, but we still have to get to our destination."
Ciudad Juarez gained international notoriety in the late 1990s and early 2000s after a wave of slayings involving women. The victims, mainly young, single women, would disappear, their bodies later found in shallow graves in desert areas around the arid city. According to an Amnesty International report, 370 young women and girl were killed in Ciudad Juarez between 1993 and 2005. Most of the slayings remain unsolved.
Mexicans are very familiar with La Diana Cazadora, as it's known in Spanish. A stone monument of the Roman goddess, nude, long-haired and holding a bow, stands on Mexico City's Reforma Avenue, a major thoroughfare. A replica was erected in Ciudad Juarez.
Journalist Edgar Roman in Ciudad Juarez contributed to this report.

Hong Kong journalists: Press freedom is at an all-time low
By Wilfred Chan, CNN
updated 11:08 PM EST, Mon February 24, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
6,500 people march in Hong Kong to protest media censorship
Rally organizer Shirley Yam says press freedom is at an all-time low
Hong Kong publications often suffer consequences for criticizing the government
Report: More than half of Hong Kong's media leaders are Chinese political affiliates
Hong Kong (CNN) -- With its tradition of free speech, Hong Kongers have long prided themselves on their strong opinions and loud mouths. But now local journalists say they are being shut up.
On Sunday, 6,500 people massed in downtown Hong Kong to protest what they see as alarming levels of media censorship in the former British colony as it grows closer to Mainland China.
The march comes just over a week after thousands of runners in the Hong Kong Standard Chartered Marathon wore blue ribbons to raise awareness of "deteriorating" press freedoms.
Protest organizer and veteran journalist Shirley Yam said the city's press freedom is the worst she's seen in her 30-year career.
"Headlines were added, complete pages were removed, photos were cancelled, interviews were bought, columnists were sacked," Yam told CNN. "We get calls from senior government officials, we get calls from tycoons, saying 'we don't want to see this in your paper.'"
Self-censor to preserve China access?
Reports: China censored newspaper
Journalists in China stage rare protest
"It's sad and terrifying," she said.
Historically, Hong Kong was known as a "window into China." Prior to the opening of Communist China to the West, Hong Kong was often the only place foreign journalists could report on the mainland.
Even today, the Hong Kong media plays a watchdog role, often breaking stories about corruption, health epidemics, and human rights issues that mainland media shy away from.
Beijing is a "control freak"
But now protesting journalists say they are finding themselves silenced if they dare to question the Chinese Communist Party or Hong Kong's leader C.Y. Leung, who is favored by China's government.
Last month, journalists at Ming Pao -- a newspaper known for its coverage of human rights in China -- were stunned when their editor-in-chief was suddenly replaced by a Malaysian editor.

Days later, AM730, a tabloid daily known for its criticism of the government, announced that mainland Chinese firms had simultaneously pulled their advertisements, costing the paper over $1 million a year.
Yet those are just the big examples. Multiple journalists at the protest told CNN they have received calls from the Chinese government's representatives in Hong Kong asking them to remove coverage of certain topics or change their arguments, something they say is happening more and more often.
Hong Kong legislative council member Cyd Ho, who attended the protest, said these examples are reflective of an obsession with loyalty in the Chinese Communist Party.

"Beijing is a control freak," she told CNN. "It cannot bear to hear any opposition."
According to Ho, some Communist officials fear that critical Hong Kong journalists may be secretly working for the American or British governments.
"This is an unnecessary fear," she said. "The central government is paranoid."
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused CNN's request to comment on these allegations.
Fighting against giants
But some of the censorship may not even be forced at all.
"Suppression sometimes happens not as a the result of a direct order from the Beijing government," said Adrian Chow, a columnist for the Hong Kong Economic Times, who suggests that many journalists voluntarily cozy up to the regime in hopes of receiving favorable treatment.
"They want to show that they are in line with the Beijing government's main melody," said Chow. "I think people who resist are actually a minority."

A report released this month by the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists said that "more than half" of Hong Kong's media owners have accepted appointments to China's main political assemblies.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong's press freedom ratings have fallen precipitously.
French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom in 2014 -- a far cry from its 18th place ranking in 2002, when the rankings were first conducted. And a 2013 opinion survey by the University of Hong Kong found that over half of Hong Kongers believed that the local press engaged in self-censorship.
Protesters fear things may get worse still.
"To be honest, we are not optimistic at all," said Yam. "We're journalists, we don't want to be in the news, we should be covering the news."
"But as journalists, we are used to fighting against giants, and that's what we shall continue to do," she added.
Ho acknowledged the uncertainty.
"Some people say Hong Kong is dying," she said. "But today I witnessed love and support for Hong Kong. I believe that if everybody in the community stays firm on our core values, nobody can corrupt us."
