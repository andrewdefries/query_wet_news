TUCSON, Arizona (CNN) -- Howard Dean lashed out Saturday at Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. John Kerry with some of the harshest rhetoric of the campaign, calling Kerry "another special interest clone."
Dean, a former Vermont governor, is trying to revive his struggling campaign days before voters in seven states choose Democratic presidential nominees.
Meanwhile, a CNN/Los Angeles Times poll of Democrats in Arizona, Missouri and South Carolina show Dean running no higher than third place among registered Democrats. The poll was completed Friday and released Saturday. (Poll: Three states, one question)
Dean said he was "outraged" and "furious" by a Washington Post report that Kerry has raised more money from paid lobbyists than any other senator during the past 15 years.
Kerry has made standing up to corporate lobbyists a central theme of his campaign.
"It turns out we've got more than one Republican in the race," Dean said. Dean has previously called retired Gen. Wesley Clark, former NATO supreme allied commander, a Republican.
Kerry, on a campaign swing Saturday through Missouri and Oklahoma, told reporters he has not taken money from lobbying groups, only individuals -- and that "Those guys have never, ever, ever gotten anything" in return.
"I'm the only person in the United States Senate who has been elected four times who has voluntarily ... refused to take any checks from political action committees or from the large interests," he said. Although individual lobbyists have contributed to his campaigns, he said, "If anybody in America thinks that a $1,000 contribution against 14 million in a campaign is somehow going to sway my vote, there's a level of cynicism about this."
A study by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Kerry has received more money from lobbyists than any senator, current or former, dating back to 1989, when the center first starting collecting the data. As of September 30, 2003, Kerry had received nearly $640,000, the group said.
The data list contributions from the trial lawyer lobby as coming from "lawyers" rather than "lobbyists."
A study from the same group showed Sen. John Edwards, who made his fortune as a trial attorney, has received much more in contributions from lawyers than any other senator, though he has been in the Senate only one term.
Dean, who was the national front-runner before placing third in the Iowa caucuses and second in the New Hampshire primary, seized on the Post report during a campaign stop in Tucson.
"We are not going to beat George Bush by nominating somebody who is the handmaiden of special interests," Dean said. "We are not going to beat George Bush with someone who has his hand as deeply in his pockets as George W. Bush.
"All that time that John Kerry was taking those hundreds of thousands of dollars from lobbyists, we were getting 89 percent of our contributions from ordinary Americans and small donations. This is how you take the country back for ordinary people, not by nominating yet another special interest clone in Washington."
Speaking to reporters later, Dean accused his opponents of "pirating my message" while not abiding by their own words.
At the beginning of a speech Saturday in Kansas City, Missouri, Kerry attacked the Bush administration and President Bush's top political adviser, telling a crowd of several hundred that "Karl Rove's lobbyists" and "all those powerful interests" are getting access to the White House.
Kerry said as president he would issue an executive order banning anyone in government from working as a lobbyist for five years after leaving government service, and would make sure every meeting between lobbyists and public officials "is a matter of public record."
Kerry, Edwards lead polls
CNN and the Los Angeles Times published a poll Saturday showing three candidates in contention in Arizona, Missouri and South Carolina.
Kerry held his largest lead in Missouri, where 37 percent of respondents said they will vote for him. That was followed by 11 percent for Edwards and 7 percent for Dean. The sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
In Arizona, Kerry's lead was slimmer, with 29 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him. Clark received support from 22 percent of respondents and Dean followed with 13 percent. The sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
Howard Dean: Still smiling but no longer leading in opinion polls.
In South Carolina, Edwards held the lead with 32 percent support, followed by Kerry's 20 percent showing. Clark was third with 8 percent of the vote. The sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
In addition to the polling data, Kerry's momentum continued to build Saturday when his campaign announced three more endorsements.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the largest newspaper in Missouri, will throw its support to the senator from Massachusetts on Sunday, the Kerry campaign said. Both Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Lt. Gov. John D. Cherry will announce their support for Kerry on Saturday -- one week before Michigan holds caucuses, the Kerry campaign said.
The Post-Dispatch endorsement will tout Kerry's "long experience, knowledge of world affairs, steadfastness in public life and a life story on national service and public valor," according to a copy provided by the Kerry campaign.
It will give Kerry a boost in a state that has been up for grabs since Rep. Dick Gephardt, a longtime congressman from Missouri, dropped out of the race after a poor showing in Iowa. Missouri has the most delegates -- 45 -- of any state choosing delegates Tuesday. South Carolina, Delaware, Oklahoma, Arizona and Missouri will hold Democratic primaries, and New Mexico and North Dakota will hold caucuses.
In all, 269 delegates are up for grabs Tuesday, about 12 percent of the 2,161 delegates needed to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on July 26.
Dean leads the Democratic delegate count with 113. Kerry, the front-runner in the race after victories in New Hampshire and Iowa, has 94 delegates.
Dean is leading in delegates despite Kerry's wins in Iowa and New Hampshire because the nominating system includes 801 "super delegate" votes held by Democratic party leaders and elected officials. Those party figures who have endorsed Dean are super delegates, and their votes, then, count in the delegate tally to date. (Where things stand: A delegates scorecard)
All the candidates are fighting for as big a piece of the delegate pie as they can grab. Edwards, the senator from North Carolina who was born in South Carolina, has said he needs to win South Carolina.
He has focused much of his campaigning in South Carolina during the past week, but Saturday began a tour through several other states. At a stop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Attorney General Patricia Madrid -- chairwoman of Edwards' New Mexico campaign -- told the audience of several hundred voters, "I looked at the electability of this man, and this is the one that can beat Bush."
He focused on his economic message of helping lift Americans out of poverty, reiterating his own story of growing up the poor son of a mill worker. He avoided attacks on his opponents, focusing on more positive messages that helped propel him to a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
But he also took on Bush, saying, "He goes to a $2,000-ticket event; he has no idea what goes on in the real world."
Clark scheduled events Saturday in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma. He is hoping for a strong showing in Oklahoma, a neighbor to his home state of Arkansas, to keep his presidential ambitions alive.
Sen. Joe Lieberman, who came in fifth in Iowa, did not campaign Saturday, in keeping with his religious faith.

TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has restarted work at a nuclear facility, saying it is for peaceful purposes only, and flatly rejected a European offer aimed at ensuring the nation does not seek nuclear weapons.Monday's moves dealt a double blow to U.S. and European officials who had warned they may bring the issue to the U.N. Security Council if Iran did not agree to sign an agreement restricting its nuclear activities.Hard-line conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took office as Iran's president on Wednesday. Though Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has far more power -- and final word in all matters of state -- Ahmadinejad had vowed to defend Iran's right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes.Iran had suspended its nuclear activities amid heavy international pressure. U.S. and European officials called on Tehran not to resume any such activities until it reached an agreement with negotiators from the EU-3 -- Britain, France, and Germany.But Monday, Iran announced it was restarting the Isfahan facility for uranium conversion -- not uranium enrichment, which the United States and some other countries fear could be part of a covert nuclear weapons program.On state-run TV, Iran insisted there was no rule against resuming uranium conversion, and said that process had not been sealed -- just suspended.It said the Isfahan nuclear plant was restarted after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, installed surveillance cameras.The IAEA issued a statement saying Iran restarted uranium conversion after cameras were put in, "but regrettably" before the testing of the cameras was completed.Other parts of the process line that had been sealed "remain intact," the statement said.The United States has no diplomatic ties with Iran. But U.S. officials openly called on Iran to accept the EU-3 offer, a package of proposals promising long-term support for a nuclear energy program in exchange for guarantees not to develop nuclear weapons.Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid-Reza Asefi, said over the weekend the offer was "not acceptable." And the nation's senior negotiator, Hussein Mousavian, said his nation would under no circumstances "barter its right to the enrichment process."Asefi said Monday he met with the ambassadors of Britain, Germany, and France, and informed them Tehran was rejecting the offer.It was unclear whether U.S. officials may bring the case to the United Nations.U.S. President George W. Bush once branded Iran part of the "axis of evil," along with North Korea and Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Story Tools

Speakerphone has great call qualityStory Highlights Tritton AX Visor is a Bluetooth speakerphone with an attractive OLED screen It has two microphone modes for use both in cars and as a desktop speakerphone Unit sometimes had insufficient volume when in the car, and it's a little pricey Easy controls and great sound quality make this one of the better speakerphones Next Article in Technology » By Nicole Lee (CNET) -- Not everyone needs a Bluetooth headset for hands-free chatting while in the car. If you prefer to keep your ears unplugged, a Bluetooth speakerphone might be a better option. Tritton, which also makes the AX Micro Bluetooth headset, has recently launched the Visor Bluetooth Hands-Free Car Kit, which is essentially a portable speakerphone. Unlike a lot of other Bluetooth speakerphones out there, the Visor steps it up a notch with a nice OLED screen that can show caller ID. There are also two mics to accommodate two different modes--an in-car mode, plus a desktop speakerphone mode. All that combined with easy-to-use controls and great sound quality makes this one of the better speakerphones out there. The AX Visor will cost you, though, as it retails for $120. Design: The Tritton AX Visor has a sleek and modern rectangular design, and its black body with silver trim makes it look quite stylish. Measuring 4.8 inches long by 2.0 inches wide by 0.8 inch thick, the Visor has a large speaker grille on the upper half, and then slopes downward toward the lower half. The slope itself is home to a 2-inch OLED screen, which shows information like caller ID, battery strength, Bluetooth connection status, a mode indicator, and call status. When the Visor is flipped upside down to fit underneath a car's sun visor, the internal accelerometer is smart enough to also flip the OLED display upside down so you can read it.

The lower half of the Visor is home to a large multifunction button, located right in the middle underneath a phone symbol. The power toggle is on the right spine, and the left is home to a Mute/Hold button and a volume rocker. We really liked having a dedicated power toggle and a dedicated Mute button since that makes using the multifunction button a little less complicated. All buttons were easy to press and use, though the multifunction button felt a little stiffer than we would like. At the bottom of the Visor are two microphones -- an omnidirectional mic when it's in use as a desktop speakerphone, and a unidirectional mic when it's in use in the car. The Visor automatically turns on the appropriate mic depending on how it's positioned -- as we mentioned, when it's flipped upside down it automatically triggers in-car mode. Next to the microphones is a charging jack. On the back of the Visor is a slot for a metal clip, which can then be clipped on to a car's visor. It works pretty well, but the clip fits so tightly in the slot that it can be a bit of a pain to put in and take out. Road test: We paired the Tritton AX Visor with the RIM BlackBerry Pearl successfully. Call quality was excellent -- the different microphones really do work well to emphasize your voice in the two different environments. When in-car mode is activated, the unidirectional mic helps to block out surrounding noise and eliminate echo, so that callers can hear you more effectively over the din of engine noises and other auditory distractions. We tested this out, and indeed, callers had no problem hearing us. However, we sometimes had trouble hearing them -- the maximum volume on the speakerphone sometimes wasn't loud enough to drown out the engine and traffic noises. In desktop speakerphone mode, the omnidirectional mic works to pick up your voice from all angles, which resulted in callers hearing us loud and clear, plus vice versa. Features: These include answering, ending, and rejecting calls, as well as last number redial, voice dial support, call mute, three-way conferencing, and the capability to transfer a call from the Visor to the phone and vice versa. The Visor's internal accelerometer is also sensitive enough to car vibration. So whenever you start up your car's engine, the Visor will sense it, and will automatically look to connect to the last paired cell phone. The Tritton AX Visor comes with a USB charging cable and an AC adapter. It has a rated battery life of 15 hours talk time and 16.7 days standby time.

Supreme Court eases restrictions on corporate campaign spendingBy Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer Court eases campaign limitsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Ruling gives special interests "more power in Washington," president saysBig business, unions, nonprofits get more power to spend freely in federal electionsMajority: "Speech dynamic is changing," and "onerous restrictions" need to be avoidedDissent: Need to limit spending should outweigh "applications of judge-made rules"

Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has given big business, unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections, a major turnaround that threatens a century of government efforts to regulate the power of corporations to bankroll American politics. A 5-4 conservative majority crafted a narrow overhaul of federal campaign spending Thursday that could have an immediate effect on this year's congressional midterm elections. The justices eased long-standing restrictions on "independent spending" by corporations and unions in political campaigns. "When government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought," Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority. "The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves." The opinion radically alters the election calculus, offering greater spending flexibility for a broader range of for-profit and nonprofit groups seeking a voice in the crowded national political debate. Hours after the ruling, President Obama responded, saying the court has given "the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington -- while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates." In a statement, he said he is telling his administration "to get to work immediately with Congress on this issue. We are going to talk with bipartisan congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision. The public interest requires nothing less." "The Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics," Obama said. "It is a major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans." Reaction on the other side said the ruling was long overdue. "The Supreme Court's decision today is a victory for the First Amendment and the right of all Americans to participate in the political process," said Theodore Olson, who successfully argued the case for the conservative Citizens United. In a dissent to the opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, "In a democratic society, the long-standing consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden applications of judge-made rules." He added, "The court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions around the nation." The case was the first one heard on the bench for newest Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and she voted in dissent with her three more liberal colleagues. The issue hinged on whether corporations' ability to pour money into election campaigns could be strictly regulated, or whether corporations have free-speech rights to spend their cash to influence elections, just as individual donors do. In this ruling, the justices also nullified earlier rulings upholding the core of a 6-year-old federal law aimed at curbing corporate campaign spending. Under current law, there are severe restrictions on campaign ads used by corporations for federal elections. They generally must be issue-focused -- talking about abortion or taxes, for instance -- and not expressly supporting or opposing a candidate. Those limits have now been generally removed. The specific case grew out of a documentary on Hillary Clinton. Produced last year by Citizens United, "Hillary: The Movie" was a scorching attack on the then-presidential candidate. The filmmakers wanted to promote it during the heat of the 2008 primary season, but a federal court blocked any ads, as well as airings on cable television's video on demand. On that specific question, the justices ruled against Citizens United, saying federal restrictions on broadcast ads are appropriate. "Citizens United's narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute," Kennedy wrote. The Washington-based nonprofit corporation and advocacy organization balked at campaign finance rules that would have required disclosure of its financial backers, and restrictions on when the film could air. It was financed with a mix of corporate and individual donations. Navigating the complex, ever-evolving landscape of election money rules has spurred a cottage industry of financial, political and legal armies, ready to do battle over the money and the message. The crux of this dispute, like others before it, is just how far the government may go to regulate campaign spending and campaign ads. In his opinion, Kennedy acknowledged that, but said Americans should be trusted to decide competing election issues. "The appearance of influence or access," he wrote, "will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy." "Our nation's speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights," Kennedy said. "The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach." But Stevens, who read part of his harsh dissent from the bench, said, "The court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding." Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts were key to the ruling, agreeing with their more conservative colleagues. Alito replaced moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who upheld past corporate restrictions in 2003, when the high court last confronted the issue. Section 203 of the comprehensive Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002, widely known as the McCain-Feingold law, bans the broadcast of "electioneering communication" by corporations, trade groups, unions and some issue advocacy groups, if the material would air close to election dates and identify candidates by name or image. The law also requires an on-screen notice of the groups financing such ads, as well as public disclosure of all who donated to the sponsoring organizations. The landmark McCain-Feingold law took effect the day after the November 2002 elections. Among its many provisions are a ban on "soft money," the unlimited and unregulated contributions to national political parties; a ban, in the 60 days before an election, on advocacy ads, those criticizing or supporting a candidate's stand on an issue; contribution limits; and donor disclosure requirements. Much of McCain-Feingold remains unaffected by the high court's latest ruling, including the current ban on large, unregulated donations to political parties and the candidates themselves by corporations. The case also does not affect political action committees, separate groups created by corporations, unions and others that can contribute directly to federal candidates. PAC money has a $5,000-per-candidate limit, and must be funded through voluntary contributions from employees, members or individuals, not by direct corporate or union treasuries. The ruling could have far-reaching effects beyond the federal arena. Twenty-two states have similar bans on corporate spending in state and local elections. Restrictions on money in gubernatorial, legislative and even judicial races could soon be a thing of the past. "Campaign 2010 was already bulked up with the potential of campaign ad spending," said Evan Tracey, president of Campaign Media Analysis Group and CNN's consultant on political television advertising. "Now it's on steroids." Excerpts of the movie and the ads can be viewed online at www.hillarythemovie.com. The case is Citizens United v. FEC (08-205).

Lindsay Lohan goes to jail on probation violation By Alan Duke, CNN In sending Lindsay Lohan to jail, the judge said she might behave better after seeing "how truly needy women ... have to live." STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: The judge sentences Lohan to 120 days in jail for a probation violationNEW: Lohan is expected to post bond Friday night while her lawyer appealsLohan's theft charge is reduced from a felony to a misdemeanorLohan trial set for June 3 Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody at the end of Friday's hearing in her necklace theft case after the judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation. The actress was expected to post a $75,000 bond at the jail and be freed. The judge granted the bond after her lawyer filed a notice of appeal. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner also ordered Lohan to serve 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. Sautner suggested Lohan might behave better after seeing "how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live." She must complete another 120 hours of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue. Michael Lohan: Lindsay's not a criminal

The judge also ruled Friday that the necklace theft case against Lohan will go forward to trial, but the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. "I'm going to give her an opportunity," Sautner said. Sautner did not buy the defense argument that Lohan accidentally walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that later appeared around her neck in photographs taken five days later. "If in fact it was an accident, she could have called the store back," Sautner said. Defense attorney Shawn Holley argued that Lohan was busy and scattered when she was at the store and absent-mindedly walked out with the necklace. "It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on," Holley said. The prosecution must show she had "specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace." "I see the intent here and the level of brazenness to say 'Let me see what I can get away with here,' " Sautner said. A police detective testified that Lohan's assistant handed the necklace to a police officer after learning through a website posting that police had obtained a search warrant hours earlier to search for it in her home. Prosecutor Danette Meyers argued that "it doesn't take a rocket scientist" to realize Lohan returned the necklace to police because she knew her home was about to be searched. Lohan's trial date was set for June 3, but she must return to court for a hearing May 11, the judge said. A misdemeanor could still result in up to a year in prison for Lohan. Before delivering the good news to Lohan about the reduction of the charge, the judge addressed her much-publicized misbehavior. "She thumbs her nose at the court," Sautner said, referring to an incident with another judge last year. "She walks into court with 'F U' on her fingernails. I don't know what that means unless it has 'I am' before it." The jeweler who accused Lohan of stealing the gold and diamond necklace testified Friday that she had not gotten any money from selling the security camera video of the actress in her store. Kamofie and Company owner Sofia Kamen was the second witness called by the prosecution in the preliminary hearing. Holley used the the store's licensing of the video, for a reported $40,000, to question Kamen's motives in accusing Lohan of theft. All of the money from the video licensing went to publicist Christopher Spencer, who Kamen said she fired last month because he was negotiating deals for the store that she was not interested in, she testified. Spencer subsequently disputed Kamen's account. Kamen said that she realized the necklace was missing 10 minutes after the actress left the store last January. She wasn't closely watching Lohan, even though there was another incident four days earlier in which the actress almost walked out wearing a diamond earring. "We thought it was an accident," Kamen said. "We weren't thinking that she would take it." The first prosecution witness was Tinelli Comsooksri, a store employee who was working the day of the earring incident. "She was covering the earring that she still left on with her hair," Comsooksri said. She stopped Lohan as she was walking out, Comsooksri said. As prosecutor Meyers held the infamous necklace, now known as "People's Exhibit 2," Kamen testified that it was priced at $2,500 although it cost the store only $850. She explained that retail jewelers routinely triple the wholesale price. The value of the necklace was a crucial issue for Lohan for the felony grand theft charge to be reduced to a misdemeanor. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. She did a short stint in jail last year, but she also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order.

Apparently This Matters: The Dipjar By Jarrett Bellini, CNN
updated 1:28 PM EDT, Sat October 27, 2012 | Filed under: Web
Dipjar is designed to help credit card users tip. Even cheapskates like Jarrett.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Apparently This Matters" is CNN Tech's weekly, off-kilter look at the social Web
This week, Jarrett ponders the Dipjar
The "genius" product lets credit card users tip their servers -- or whoever
Be kind to your frozen yogurt vendor. Seriously.
Editor's note: Each week in "Apparently This Matters," CNN's Jarrett Bellini applies his warped sensibilities to trending topics in social media and random items of interest on the interwebs. (CNN) -- Look, I'm not saying I'm a cheap bastard. I'm also not saying I'm a soulless ginger. Mind you, both are true. I'm just not saying it.
But to the first point, it's necessary to clarify that, despite the fact I've been known to show signs of lupus over the occasional restaurant bill, I'm actually an excellent tipper.
As for everything else in life, I'm mediocre at best.
So, this week we're going to talk about gratuity. And it all stems from a recent trending discovery on the interwebs about something called the Dipjar.
Now, I don't throw the word "genius" around too liberally. Generally, I save it for really important stuff like when a friend suggests we light something on fire. But I'm going to go ahead and drop a G-bomb on this amazing new invention. Because, for better or worse, when it comes to tipping, the Dipjar is an absolute game changer.
Or not. I've been known to get things wrong. "Gangnam Style" is still around.
Basically, the Dipjar is an electronic tip jar for store countertops in which a customer can -- as the name suggests -- dip his or her credit card to leave a fixed-amount tip for the clerk. And these days it's sort of a necessity
Increasingly, we are becoming a cash-free society, preferring the convenience of credit cards to carrying actual paper money. While this can be great for the consumer, it sort of screws over the hipster barista behind the counter who no longer gets to keep your change.
But, hey, he still has giant-gauged ear holes. So that's something.
Not only is cash becoming less popular, but it also seems that more and more credit card companies don't even require a signature for small transactions, thus eliminating the opportunity to write in a tip or, perhaps, leave that really cute server an adorable pickup line.
"I'm so alone. Hold me."
I almost never carry cash. Though, for me, it has less to do with convenience, and everything to do with racking up airline miles
"Apparently This Matters" Is Jarrett Bellini's weekly (and somewhat random) look at social-media trends.
I'm sort of obsessed. So much so, that when I actually go to book a flight I don't even use the miles I have. It's unquestionably because I'm a complete idiot, and figure why drop 40,000 miles to fly for free when I could spend $500 and get ... more miles?
Delta pretty much has me by the gonads. But it's cool. I get to board in Zone 1. And these are the things that matter to soulless gingers.
Anyway, Dipjar finally makes it easy for credit card users to tip without signing, and the company makes their money by taking a small percentage of each transaction. However, they insist that they'll always deliver at least 80 cents of every dollar to the store's employees.
Some people might say this is unfairly taking money from the people who actually earned it, but the counter-argument (pun absolutely intended because I'm awesome) is that this is money they probably wouldn't have seen in the first place.
I suppose there's no right answer here, but we should probably all get unnecessarily worked up and leave hateful, anonymous comments for each other. I'll start:
"This writer sucks!" The future, of course, is cell phones where you either tap-to-pay or maybe just command Siri to do something useful for a change.
"Siri, pay the man."
"Where are your pants?"
"Shut up, Siri."
But, for now, until our cell phones officially take over the world, the Dipjar seems to be a decent intermediary. That said, we still have to ask: Who actually deserves a Dipjar in the first place?
These days, it seems like everyone is soliciting tips. And I legitimately don't know who should get them. Naturally, we have the old standards. Servers get 15% to 20%. Bartenders get a dollar a drink. And the guy who hooks me up with illegal HBO gets 20 bucks and a Miller Lite.
But as I spoke to people this week about tipping, and as I researched the topic online, there seemed to be a huge overall backlash against leaving money for anyone with an actual tip jar. Read: People who might use the Dipjar.
The general consensus was that, in food service, if you physically come to the table with my meal you get a tip. The frozen yogurt girl, on the other hand, can go die in a ditch.
Of course, tipping isn't unique to America. But it certainly seems to be a bigger part of our culture than in other countries. For example, in the United States we even take care of the taxi driver in the same way we tip a restaurant server. And it's kind of insane.
"Here's an extra five bucks for talking on your blue tooth for the last 30 minutes. You're the best!"
For comparison, in England, riders tip, but only a small amount. In fact, while on assignment in London before the Royal Wedding, I actually spoke to a taxi driver about proper etiquette, and he told me it's polite to just round up the fare -- that the normal tip is about 50 pence (or roughly 80 cents).
He said, "You don't look towards a tip, but it's nice when you do get one."
The moral of the story is never leave your house. Life's too confusing.
But for those who do wander and buy stuff, the Dipjar is definitely a clever idea. Still, I seriously don't know who should get a tip these days. So help me sort this out. Who's worthy?
And, more importantly, has anyone seen the frozen yogurt girl?

2 killed as helicopter crashes into crane in central London
By Laura Smith-Spark and Nick Thompson, CNN
updated 5:03 PM EST, Wed January 16, 2013
Smoke pours from the burning debris of a helicopter which crashed in the Vauxhall area. The helicopter appeared to hit a crane attached to the nearby St Georges Wharf Tower before plunging into the road below during the morning rush hour. Londoner Christopher Jen was at Vauxhall Tube station en route to his marketing job when he spotted smoke rising from an area nearby. A helicopter had clipped a crane atop a building and plunged to the ground, killing two people and injuring several others, police later said. "We could hear all the sirens and you could smell the smoke as the train went past the site," he said. "The station announcers did tell us that there was a helicopter crash at Vauxhall and the engineers had to go check the tracks before we could leave." Debris is pictured beside a fire fighting vehicle at the scene of a helicopter crash.

London (CNN) -- A helicopter crashed into a construction crane atop a new luxury residential building in thick London fog Wednesday, killing the pilot and another person and sparking a line of flames as it plunged to the ground.
Thirteen others were injured in the crash that took place near a busy intersection at the height of the morning rush hour in Vauxhall, south of the River Thames in central London.
Thick smoke and flames billowed into the sky as traffic ground to a halt and emergency workers rushed to the scene, not far from landmarks like the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament.
The bent crane dangled from the building top, prompting police to cordon off roads in the area and evacuate residents and office workers. Many watched, horrified, from the street and office windows as the drama unfolded.

Watch: Crash sparks security fears
"I was standing outside having a cigarette when I saw the helicopter flying super fast towards the crane," said Rezart Islami, a builder who was working across the road from the 52-story building. "The pilot appeared not to have seen the crane because the helicopter hit it and went bang."
Islami said the rotor blade snapped off, and the copter spun to the ground and burst into flames.
"The top off the crane also came off in the impact," he said. "It all happened so fast, it was unbelievable."
Another eyewitness recounted seeing rescuers pull three injured people from two burning cars.
"It is something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse given the time of day," said police commander Neil Basu.
Vauxhall, not far from Westminster, is where a new U.S. Embassy is being built. The area, which is a mix of industrial, business and residential use, is also home to the riverside headquarters of the UK intelligence service, MI6.

Rotormotion, a helicopter charter company, identified the pilot as Peter Barnes, 50, a married father of two.
"He was one of the most highly qualified and highly skilled helicopter pilots in the UK, and his death is a great loss for the British aviation and his colleagues at Rotormotion," spokesman Paul Blezard said. "The thoughts of all the staff are with this family and two young children at this dreadful time."
Barnes was the only person on board the helicopter, which was on a scheduled commercial flight from Surrey, southwest of London, police said.
The second person killed "was in close proximity" to the helicopter, a London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said, but gave no more details.
One of the injured was treated for a broken leg, but emergency responders said the others were not seriously hurt.
Construction workers were at the site when the crash happened but were not hurt.
James Whipps, a CNN producer, said the helicopter wreckage appeared to have landed on two cars by St. George Wharf, a major residential construction project.
Watch: Eyewitness describes the scene
The St. George Wharf construction project includes the landmark St. George Wharf Tower, also known as the Vauxhall Tower. Its developers, the Berkeley Group, say it will be one of Europe's tallest residential towers.
Whipps said he heard the sound of the helicopter rotors suddenly cut out.
He did not see the impact, but as he looked though a window, he "suddenly saw this enormous fireball, black smoke, shoot up from the side of a building."
Daniel Toledo heard "a big noise" while on his way to the nearby Vauxhall station. Though Toledo didn't see the helicopter at first, he took out his camera in time to shoot exclusive aftermath video for CNN.
"I look up, after the helicopter down," said Toledo. "Big noise again. The helicopter is gone."

Nicky Morgan, a member of parliament, heard the impact from the nearby Vauxhall station.
"There was an enormous bang and clouds and clouds of thick, black smoke," she told CNN. "It was very surprising, not what you expect to see."
Despite the confusion, people remained calm, she said.
Christopher Jen was at Vauxhall Tube station on his way to his marketing job when he spotted smoke rising nearby.
"We could hear all the sirens and you could smell the smoke as the train went past the site," he said in a submission to CNN's iReport. "The station announcers did tell us that there was a helicopter crash at Vauxhall and the engineers had to go check the tracks before we could leave."
Reporters allowed through the cordons to the deadly crash scene say little can be seen other than a dark spot where the helicopter hit the ground.
A Berkeley Group spokesman said the firm was giving its full support to the emergency services after its crane was hit.
"Our thoughts at this time are with the friends and families of those killed in this tragic incident," he said.
Firefighters are now working with contractors to make the mangled crane safe.
Prime Minister David Cameron thanked the emergency services for their "rapid and professional response."
Poor visibility
Many helicopters follow the Thames as a flight route through the city. This helicopter appeared to be flying farther south than usual, Whipps said.
No cause has yet been given for the crash, but visibility was poor in London on Wednesday morning, with fog and a very low cloud ceiling.
Chris Yates, an aviation security expert, told CNN it was likely there would be questions about whether the helicopter should have been flying in these conditions.
Under safety regulations, tall buildings must have navigation lights on top to make them visible to low-flying aircraft, he said.
Helicopters are not supposed to fly within 500 feet of tall structures in central London, he said.
The London Heliport is near the crash site, on the banks of the Thames, at Battersea.
The Air Accidents Investigation Bureau, part of the UK Department for Transport, has sent a team to investigate the crash.
The Civil Aviation Authority says helicopters in London have only limited radar help and fly mostly using visual reference points on the ground.
Certain designated routes for helicopters are in place to "provide maximum safety by avoiding flying over built up areas as much as possible," it says.
Nearly 170 flights followed the central London route along the Thames in December, its figures show. About 250 flights arrived and departed from the heliport at Battersea in the same month.
Wednesday's crash caused major disruptions for many people on their way to work.
Vauxhall, with a rail station, Underground station and large bus station, is an important transit point for those traveling from the south to other parts of London.
The Nine Elms area between Vauxhall and Battersea has been earmarked as a major regeneration site, with plans to create 16,000 new homes and 25,000 new jobs.
CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Dominique Van Heerden, Sarah Brown, Saskya Vandoorne and Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report.
