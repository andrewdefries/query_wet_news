The storyThe 30,000 additional troops deployed to Iraq in January could come home by next July, but further American withdrawals would be "premature," the U.S. commander there told a fractious congressional hearing Monday."Our experience in Iraq has repeatedly shown that projecting too far into the future is not just difficult, it can be misleading and even hazardous," Gen. David Petraeus said at a joint hearing of the House Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. "The events of the past six months underscore that point."The testimony by Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, was interrupted numerous times by demonstrators."The American people want our troops home," one woman shouted. Watch Petraeus say how "surge" has workedRep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, the Armed Services Committee's chairman, ordered several protesters arrested for interrupting what he said "may be the most important hearing of the year."

Law firm: Jackson had slight pulse when doctor found himStory Highlights Dr. Conrad Murray found Jackson not breathing but with a slight pulse Murray believed to be last person to see Michael Jackson alive Jackson's father concerned about his son's last moments Police conduct "extensive interview" with MurrayNext Article in Entertainment » Read VIDEOBIOGRAPHYTIMELINE LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father says he is concerned about the last moments of his son's life and about the personal physician who found the pop icon unconscious at the singer's estate. Singer Ne-Yo (L) and host Jamie Foxx pay tribute to Michael Jackson at 2009 BET Awards in Los Angeles. "I have a lot of concerns," Joe Jackson told CNN's Don Lemon on the red carpet leading up to the BET Awards ceremony Sunday night. "I can't get into that, but I don't like what happened." Michael Jackson's personal physician, who was questioned extensively by investigators over the weekend, found the singer not breathing in bed when he entered the singer's estate last week, according to the law firm representing the doctor. However, Jackson did have a slight pulse when Dr. Conrad Murray discovered him Thursday, and Murray tried to resuscitate the singer as he awaited paramedics, a representative with the law firm of Stradley, Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston, Texas, told CNN Sunday. Attorney Edward Chernoff is representing Murray. The law firm said reports that Murray injected Jackson with powerful painkillers, such as Demerol or Oxycontin, were false. Funeral arrangements for Jackson were pending Sunday. "We haven't gotten to that yet -- we're working on that," Joe Jackson told CNN's Lemon. Watch Joe Jackson talk about the death of his son » Murray voluntarily met for several hours with detectives, the Los Angeles Police Department said late Saturday night.

"Detectives assigned to Robbery-Homicide Division met with Dr. Murray and conducted an extensive interview," a police statement said. "Dr. Murray was cooperative and provided information which will aid the investigation." Watch attorney for Jackson's doctor say his client is not a suspect » Jackson's family suspects that Murray can answer some lingering questions about the singer's last hours, but they have been unable to contact him, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Saturday. "The routine inquiry is now an investigation," Jesse Jackson said. "They (Jackson's family) didn't know the doctor. ... He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son." Watch latest developments in Jackson's death investigation » Jackson family attorney L. Londell McMillan told CNN that a second autopsy is "under way." "We'll let that process take its course," McMillan, who accompanied Joe Jackson to the BET Awards, told CNN. McMillan said a will has not surfaced since Michael Jackson's death and that the singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, is seeking custody of his two children. "Well, if there is no will, then under the state of California it goes to the next of kin. That's an adult to administer and oversee the best interests of the children and that would be Mr. and Mrs. Jackson," McMillan said. "And Katherine Jackson is the duly appointed person." He added, "She will seek custody of the children. That's who Michael would have wanted to have the children, she loves them dearly." On Saturday, the founder of 1-800-AUTOPSY, a private firm that conducts autopsies, told CNN that the Jackson family had contacted the business to inquire about possibly having a second autopsy done there. Jesse Jackson added on Saturday that the family needed "an independent autopsy to get even more answers to questions that are now being driven by the gap between when Michael was last seen alive and was pronounced dead."iReport.com: Tributes pour in for Jackson There are lingering questions, including: "How long had he stopped breathing? How long had he been unconscious?" Jesse Jackson said. Michael Jackson was discovered unconscious Thursday by paramedics at his home, where Murray apparently had tried to revive him. He was rushed to a Los Angeles medical center, where he was pronounced dead. Listen to the 911 call » An autopsy performed by a county medical examiner was inconclusive -- although officials said there were no indications of external trauma or foul play. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said more tests are needed before a cause of death can be determined. That could take four to six weeks. Detectives impounded Murray's car, which was parked at the singer's rented home, because, they said, it may contain evidence related to Jackson's death, possibly prescription medications. Police have released no information on what they may have found.

When phones are too big for pocketsBy John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Mobile Tech pundit Veronica Belmont tries to fit a new Dell phone in her pocket. Bucking previous trends, phones are getting bigger now. STORY HIGHLIGHTSIt used to be cool for mobile phones to be small; now they're getting biggerSome, including an upcoming phone from Dell, are pushing the limits of pocketsYouTube videos show tech pundits trying to shove the Dell Streak in their jeansMost are unsuccessful; but the phone still gets good ratings from critics

Dell Inc.
(CNN) -- Something weird is happening to mobile phones: After shrinking from enormous Zack Morris proportions in the '80s and '90s, they're getting bigger again. So big, in fact, that some won't fit in jeans pockets anymore. The Dell Streak, which is set to be released in the U.S. later this summer, is the biggest of the big-daddy phones so far, with a 5-inch screen. The screen of the iPhone 4, by comparison, measures only 3.5 inches diagonally. When held up to a person's ear, the Dell phone looks like a book. The Streak's mondo screen has become the focus of much debate on the internet, with tech bloggers arguing about what kinds of pants you'd have to wear to carry it around in your pocket; how big your hands have to be to hold it; whether or not people will stare at you when you're using it; and, perhaps most significantly, what exactly constitutes a phone these days. Is a phone just any device that can make calls? Or does it have to be portable enough to carry with you, regardless of how baggy your pants are? As mobile phone technology improved, "there definitely was a trend for smaller and there definitely was a trend for thinner," said Ramon Llamas, a senior research analyst who covers mobile technology for IDC. "But I think we're seeing the pendulum swinging back in favor of larger phones." Mobile phone makers are trying to "push the boundaries of what is acceptable in a pocket," said Ross Rubin, executive director of industry analysis for consumer technology at the NPD Group. Several Android phones -- which run on an operating system developed by Google, as opposed to those by Microsoft or Apple -- have come out with screens that are larger than 4 inches diagonally. The HTC Evo and the Motoroloa Droid X, for example, both have 4.3-inch screens. Sony Ericsson is rumored, according to the blog Engadget, to be working on another 5-inch smartphone, the same size as the Dell Streak. (As a side note, the HTC Evo is so big that it comes with a kickstand). In video reviews of these ever-larger phones, it seems almost to be a requirement these days for tech pundits to try to shove the things in their pockets as a way to determine whether the devices are truly portable. In one such video, Veronica Belmont, co-host of a video show called Tekzilla, puts the Dell Streak in the front pocket of her pants only to find that about a third of the phone is still sticking out. One YouTube video, titled "Dell Streak vs. Jeans," starts with a shot of a man's waist line, shown only from the thighs to mid-belly. "The reason you're staring at my hips is that I'm going to show you what the Dell Streak is like, fitting in a jeans pocket," the host says. "Now, these jeans have got quite a deep pocket and, even still, it pokes out a little bit over the top. You can tuck it right in and there's still a corner coming out at the top there." The man then proceeds to stuff the Streak into his back pocket, which he decides isn't such a good idea, either. It sticks out, which could make it easily accessible to pickpockets, he says. "And you're certainly not going to want to sit on it." Dell did not return CNN's phone calls about this story. The other potential issue with large phones is that it can be difficult to hold them up to your face, depending how big your hands are and if your arms are strong. When Chris Hall tested the Dell Streak for the British website Pocket-lint, he said his hand literally became tired and stretched-out from holding the phone. He said he also got some stares from strangers. "People are going to look at you in a funny way" when you're holding such a large gadget up to your face, he said. Hall still gave the phone -- which is sometimes referred to as a small "tablet" computer rather than a large phone -- a good rating: 8 of 10 stars. In a video review for the blog Engadget, Richard Lai takes a bit of a contrarian view, saying the Dell Streak is still small enough to carry comfortably in a standard pant pocket. "Obviously you see a bit of bulge here," he says after putting the phone in his jeans pocket, "but you get that with any phones these days, really, you know? Sliding it in and out is no problem, you see?" Lai does note, however, that, if you want to walk up a flight of stairs with the 5-inch phone in your pocket, you should "shift your phone as far to the side [of your pocket] as possible" in order to maintain a normal range of movement. "But other than that we've had no real issues with it," he says. Despite some fuss about the bulk of these 4- and 5-inch phones, there are some clear advantages to screens with more real estate. As phones increasingly become internet portals, e-book readers and video players, having bigger screens makes them more useful, Llamas said. Those functions are butting up against some long-held ideas about what a mobile phone is -- namely that it's a gadget that you can easily carry in a pocket and hold to your ear to make a call. So maybe we need a new cell phone definition: One that can fit in your cargo shorts.

Vote gives 'Lost Boys' hope for country's future By Faith Karimi, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSAbout 70 Southern Sudan natives travel from Atlanta to Nashville to vote in referendumHistoric vote this week will determine whether Sudan will split in two: north and southAbout 55,000 Southern Sudanese are voting in U.S. and seven other countries Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Moses Chol hops into a van, rubs his hands together and signals the passengers to quiet down. As he leans back to address them, his face breaks into a grin, his teeth glistening in the dawn haze. "Today, we say goodbye to the north," he says as young men and women cheer, peeking through woolen scarves and hats. Chol is among about 70 Southern Sudan natives gathered on a cold morning in a church parking lot in Clarkston, Georgia, a metro Atlanta enclave popular with refugees. The group is heading to Nashville to vote in a referendum that could split Sudan into two: the north and the south. Several million people in Southern Sudan are voting this week in the historic referendum on whether to declare independence from a government based in the north. About 55,000 Southern Sudanese are casting ballots in the United States and seven other countries. Chol drives in a convoy of more than a dozen cars. As it snakes out of the parking lot, some passengers sing a song by former guerrilla fighters who now lead the government and army of semi-autonomous Southern Sudan. "We will never surrender; we will keep fighting until we get what we want," they sing in Arabic, the national language. At the end of the song, they pump their fists in the air and chant: "Yes to separation!" The referendum is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end two decades of civil war, which left about 2 million dead. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians or animists in the south. For Chol, the referendum is more of reparation. He's one of the so-called Lost Boys: a generation of children who fled the nation's civil war and are now scattered across several continents. The United States resettled nearly 4,000 of them about a decade ago. The men -- now mostly in their 20s and 30s -- have spent the past decade rebuilding their lives. The war forced Chol and others to trek hundreds of miles through deserts and swamps, fending off lions and other animals, during their journeys into neighboring countries. Once there, they lived in sprawling refugee camps for years. Chol, 32, says he has been dreaming of the referendum for years. "It's time for them to hear our voices, for us to revolt against all the pain we suffered," the graduate student says. "A lot of people have died for this day. ... I don't care what government comes after this. No government will be worse than what we have." His voice trails off as he pauses and stares into space. "Passing this referendum means my father did not die in vain. It means our children will not live scarred lives. ... We will be the last 'lost boys' Sudan will ever see." The conflict scarred an entire generation in remote Southern Sudan, which is the size of Texas but only has 30 miles of paved roads. Through the years, hundreds of thousands of Sudanese fled the south to escape fighting and famine. About 80 percent of Sudan's oil reserves are in the south, another flash point in the war. Although the north has flourished, the south has not changed much over the years, according to Chol. "This north claims they want to be one nation," he says. "How can we be when they have schools and clean water, and their children are not dying of simple diseases? In the south, people still drink stagnant water. They have nothing." Passengers chime in to add to the list of grievances with the north. Some cite the north's attempts to impose sharia, or Islamic law, on non-Muslims -- a key reason the nation erupted in civil war in 1983. Sharia remains the law of the land in northern Sudan. "You see my hair. It would get me in trouble in the north because of sharia law," says Grace Ajawin, a bakery employee, as she points to her red cornrows. "I want my children to walk out of the house without being forced to cover their hair, to wear what they want, to go to church without being forced to convert to Islam." Passing this referendum ... means our children will not live scarred lives. ... We will be the last 'lost boys' Sudan will ever see.--Sothern Sudan native Moses Chol

Nashville
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has warned that he will tighten the application of sharia in northern Sudan if Southern Sudan votes for independence. Everyone in the vans believes that the south will split from the north. Any attempt to introduce a different scenario is brushed off as negativity. Ajawin is admonished when she says she will "never" go back to Sudan if al-Bashir does not honor a vote to split. "How can (al-Bashir) not honor the vote when the whole world is watching?" Marko Ayii, 25, shoots back. "You need to stop your negative thinking." Chol says he will move home if Southern Sudan is reborn as a new nation. "When I graduate, I'll thank the Americans for being kind to us, and go help my people," he says. After about four hours, the convoy pulls up at the Lost Boys Center, a one-story red brick building just south of the office towers of downtown Nashville. The center is one of eight polling stations across the United States that will be open until Saturday. More than 900 Southern Sudanese are registered to vote there, poll officials say. Other centers are in Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Omaha, Nebraska; Phoenix; Seattle and Washington. The vote is being organized by the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission. Outside the Nashville center, a crowd awaits. Some are dancing while others wave American and Southern Sudan flags. At the front of the line, Malual Machop, 42, of Nashville waits for his chance to vote, weeping quietly. "My crying is not for sadness; it's for happiness," he says. "I never knew I would vote for this separation in my lifetime. We have been slaves for so long. We are now being liberated." Outside, Ngong Aguek, 42, a musician from Southern Sudan who traveled from Orlando to vote, is busy ripping up his Sudanese passport. The crowd claps and cheers as the pages flutter into the windy, wintry air. "This passport has enslaved me for so long," he says. "It has treated me like a second-class citizen, destroyed my dignity, and killed and separated my family." The musician says he has been targeted by the northern government for criticizing it. "But (the truth) needs to be told, regardless of whether it will set us on fire." Aguek saunters into a waiting van and drives off, leaving shredded pieces of his passport outside the polling station. Inside, Chol casts his vote and triumphantly holds up his ink-stained finger for flashing cameras. "Bye bye, Sharia law; bye bye, slavery," he says. "Now (the north) should leave us alone, and we'll leave them alone. We can't be one nation, but we'll be good neighbors." He makes his way out to the waiting vans. And in an unconscious defiance of the government he wants no part of, he steps over the pale green and pink passport pages scattered outside.

Summertime a hot time for USA Network
By Umika Pidaparthy, Special to CNN
updated 10:31 AM EDT, Thu May 10, 2012
USA's new series, "Common Law," (left) will form a crucial part of USA's popular summer block, along with "White Collar."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New series "Common Law" is set to kick off USA network's 2012 summer line-up
USA's original series are often character-driven comedy-dramas set in beautiful locations
Bill McGoldrick, the executive VP of programming, said they are picking up edgier shows
(CNN) -- When Entertainment Weekly published the first trailer of USA Network's new series "Common Law" in November on its website, readers were abuzz with excitement.
According to the synopsis, the show revolves around two quarreling Los Angeles homicide detectives, played by Warren Kole and Michael Ealy, who are ordered to go to couples therapy. While many were keen to see "Think Like a Man" star Ealy again, it appeared that most commenters were sure they would like "Common Law" because they knew what to expect.
"Another light-hearted show that is PERFECT on USA," one user, Tim Mahoney, said.
"I'll always give a USA Network show a chance and rarely have I been disappointed," another user named Kaiulani said.
Now, six months later, "Common Law" is set to kick off the network's 2012 summer line-up that includes returning shows "Royal Pains," "Burn Notice," "Suits," "White Collar," "Necessary Roughness" and "Covert Affairs."
The buddy-cop show, which will premiere at 10 p.m. ET Friday, will form a crucial part of USA's annual and popular summer block. The network even claimed that it "owns summer" in a recent news release. According to ratings tracker Nielsen, USA averaged 3.61 million viewers in primetime from May 30 to August 21 last year. The newspaper USA Today also reported in January that USA Network had an average of 3.2 million total viewers and remained the top-rated cable network for the sixth consecutive year in 2011.
Over the years, this success has largely been attributed to USA's original series, which are often character-driven comedy-dramas that are fun and set in bright and beautiful locations, which have become almost synonymous with destination summer viewing.
The 'Characters Welcome' branding
Jon Turteltaub, executive producer of "Common Law," told CNN that the show was originally written to air on CBS, but was picked up by USA because the focus on the detectives' relationship and therapy sessions seemed to be a better fit for them.
"USA does work differently, they push characters over plot," he said. "They were really interested in well-developed and fully drawn characters. For the creators of the show, that's music to our ears."
Turteltaub said that he sees this priority not necessarily as a formula, but more of "a guiding principle of things that have worked."
"USA has been very clear about not letting the story bog down the tone," he said. "The feel of your show is more important than the police procedural details. If we are loving the characters and feeling a sense of entertainment and fun, then three clues to solve the crime is fine, not five."
This emphasis is what drew Cory Andrew Barker to USA shows in the first place, so much so that he eventually ended up doing research on the network's programming theme.
Barker, who just graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio with a master's degree in popular culture, said he was intrigued by how the shows were tonally similar and yet often popular. In his university-approved thesis, "Genre Welcome?: Formula, Genre and Branding in USA Network's Programming and Promotional Content," he explained how the network has carved its own niche.
The show that really heralded the network's present style was "Monk," Barker found. When Tony Shalhoub's Adrian Monk, a brilliant detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder, was introduced in the summer of 2002, USA at that time was mostly known for reruns.
Barker, who also runs a blog called TV Surveillance, argues that since then, USA has branded itself with its "Characters Welcome" slogan to signify its shows' "quirky, sort of left-of-center" personalities. These characters tend to work toward "the greater good" in ways not always in tandem with the law, have an overarching goal and happen to live in sunny locales.
For example, the character of Monk solves crimes with his detailed-oriented abilities, lives in San Francisco and throughout the series is trying to figure out who murdered his wife. This pattern of elements or formula, Barker said, can be found in most of USA's shows, making them recognizable and easy to pick up and consume. So audiences are loyal as they automatically have an idea of what the next USA show will be like and view the network as unique.
"If you are a person who likes USA shows, you will probably like 'Common Law,' " Barker told CNN. "You have watched nine shows like these, so why wouldn't I try this?"
Robert Bianco, a TV critic for USA Today, has reviewed several USA Network shows and summarized the cultural perception of the network this way: "They have a very clever, successful marketing position for themselves, as the home of these 'blue sky,' mostly crime-based dramas with more of a comic twist than you would get on [for instance] FX."
Blue skies, all season long
The "blue sky" that Bianco refers to is the approach or philosophy that USA shows tend to have. The lighter theme is favored over a gloomy or gritty scenario because the objective is not to be overly somber, he said.
"The cable dramas these days have become very serious, and the network procedurals tend to be in the darker side of crimes," Bianco said. "USA shows tend to be glossier, on the sunnier side."
Jeff Eastin's USA series "White Collar" is a good example.
The show is about a con man named Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) who, after getting caught by the FBI, helps them solve white-collar crimes using his expertise. Eastin, the show's creator executive producer and show runner, said that since the crimes mostly involve white collar offenses such as art forgery, the lighter elements of the crime are shown and stressed on.
" 'White Collar' ... we're a good prototype show for 'blue sky,' what USA is," Eastin said. "There's a certain classy slickness to the show, just in the general world of police shows ... [It's] pushing for that cleverness [in a] sort of high-end world."
A part of that slickness also comes from the shows' locations.
"Burn Notice" is set in Miami, "Royal Pains" in the Hamptons, "Psych" in Santa Barbara, all of which bring to mind warm weather, beaches and an abundance of sunshine. Eastin said that for the New York City-set "White Collar," there is a tendency to shoot in places where the architecture can be exploited.
Barker said that these settings, along with the warm weather timing of the premieres, capture the allure of summer and are all about escapism.
"You are sort of immediately drawn to this place where you might want to take a vacation to," he said.
Future of USA Network
Many critics have pointed out that despite the likely success, USA's cookie-cutter model for its shows can only go so far and that viewers might tire of similar series.
But Bill McGoldrick, USA's executive vice president of original scripted programming, said he doesn't look at it that way. He said that when they go through show pitches, they certainly look for characters that stand out because of their background or relationships. However, McGoldrick added that while the network focuses on a feel that "puts you in a good mindset" it is not the motivating factor.
"We definitely stay away from the word 'formula,' he said. "It's a dirty word here."
McGoldrick, who worked on "Monk" and "Psych" early in his career, said that USA, like any other network, is evolving. When "Monk" was being developed, network executives at the time were not that interested in serialized character development or just procedurals.
"In those days, we saw that there were not a lot of shows doing throwback, where you could mix comedy and drama," McGoldrick said. "Where you didn't have to be so earnest and serious like 'Law and Order' and 'CSI.' "
After the success of "Monk" and the fan-base growth of "Psych" and "Burn Notice," McGoldrick said that USA is encouraging its older shows to have continuous and rougher plots and is green lighting new shows such as "Suits," which have more edge. "Covert Affairs," "Fairly Legal" and "Necessary Roughness" not only deal with more provocative subjects, but also have female leads. USA's political miniseries, "Political Animals," starring Sigourney Weaver as the secretary of state, is set to premiere this July.
Bianco said that the new direction might be challenging because the blue sky and escapist vibe might not accurately portray real life -- such as the workings of a law firm in "Suits" versus the workings of a law firm like in CBS' "The Good Wife." But he said that there is no need for USA shows to compete with the more serious shows for the fear of becoming too formulaic.
"I don't think there is anything wrong with simple, enjoyable entertainment when you pull it off well," Bianco said.

7 foods that fight fat
By Maridel Reyes, Health.com
updated 7:47 AM EDT, Fri October 12, 2012
Research suggests that salmon's omega-3 fatty acids help build calorie-burning muscle.
Calcium helps the body slim down — and yogurt has up to 50% more of it per ounce than milk.
Avocados pack a mixture of fatty acids, monounsaturated fats and antioxidants that help lower inflammation and clear blood vessels.
Beans have plenty of starch and fiber, requiring the body to work extra hard to process them.
The heat in chilis is the product of capsaicin, which can help burn 50 to 100 calories following a meal.
Green tea includes caffeine and catechin, an antioxidant. Studies suggest the combination stimulates the nervous system.
The caffeine in one cup of coffee can increase metabolism by as much as 15%.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Eating certain foods can help you burn calories, experts say
Unrefined and whole foods are best: they require more energy to break down
Salmon, yogurt and coffee are among the better foods
(Health.com) -- Get excited: You can burn calories and combat fat by eating yummy food.
"If you choose the right picks, studies show you can torch up to 300 extra calories a day," says Dr. Pamela Peeke, author of "The Hunger Fix."
Whole, unrefined foods are your heroes. Your metabolism has to work harder to break them down than processed ones, so you're zapping more calories — and storing less as fat. These recipes double up (even triple up) on foods with serious metabolism-boosting power. Take that, dastardly fat!
Salmon
What a catch! Research suggests the omega-3s in salmon and other fatty fish help build muscle — and the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn. Omega-3s may also help reduce fat storage by lowering cortisol levels (scientists have yet to confirm how).
Go for: Two 3-oz servings of fatty fish per week.
Health.com: New ways to boost your metabolism
Yogurt
Calcium-rich foods have slimming superpowers. Get too little of this mineral and your body's more likely to pack away calories as fat, according to a review of studies.
With up to 50% more calcium per ounce than milk, yogurt is a potent source. Better yet, its probiotics may help keep belly fat under control.
Go for: At least two servings a day.
Avocado
For a speedy metabolism, you need to keep inflammation in check and blood vessels clear and supple. Avocado's unique combo of essential fatty acids, monounsaturated fats, and antioxidants helps you do just that. Plus, one avocado's 14 grams of fiber kicks up your calorie burn.
Go for: One to two daily servings of foods high in healthy fats.

Beans
High in resistant starch and fiber, beans force your system to use extra energy (as in calories) to break them down.
Research from the University of Colorado suggests that if you choose foods high in resistant starch — it's also found in whole grains and not-quite-ripe bananas — you can increase your calorie-burning power by up to 24% over the course of the day.
Go for: One serving of a resistant-starch food per meal.
Chili peppers
Feel the burn? It's more than mere sensation: chilies' heat signals the presence of capsaicin, a compound that, along with capsiate, can propel the body to scorch an extra 50 to 100 calories following a spicy meal.
Go for: Chilies as hot as you can stand. (But watch out! The hottest ones — habanero, Scotch bonnet, and Thai or Indian peppers — are too fiery for many people.)
Health.com: The best and worst foods for digestion Green tea
This packs caffeine and antioxidants called catechins, a dynamic duo believed to stimulate your nervous system and increase fat-burning. Studies suggest that drinking green tea can help you drop pounds and trim your waist.
Go for: Several cups a day (keeping in mind how caffeine affects you).
Coffee
You use it to wake up — and your metabolism will, too.
The caffeine in one cup of joe temporarily perks up your metabolism by as much as 15 percent. Caffeine also helps mobilize the forces that burn stored fat.
Go for: One to two cups a day, especially before exercise.

Mothers fight to pass Ava's Law for autism coverage
By Caleb Hellerman, CNN
updated 10:47 AM EDT, Tue March 12, 2013
Melissa Solares says her son Arturo is now attending a regular preschool thanks to intensive behavioral therapy. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
18 states do not require insurance companies to pay for autism treatment
Supporters say coverage of early interventions could reduce costs long-term
Opponents say mandates drive up costs that employees and consumers can't pay
(CNN) -- Eight-year-old Ava Bullard comes bounding out of the Georgia Senate chamber, a smile stretched from ear to ear.
Ava's mother, Anna, bends down to talk to her daughter over the din in the hallway. Her own smile is all business, with a wink to the camera.
"What did he say?" she asks, referring to state Sen. Tim Golden, head of the insurance committee. " Did you tell him we need a hearing?"
"No," says Ava. "But I will!"
This playful moment between mother and daughter would have been unimaginable just six years ago, when Ava was diagnosed with autism. Bullard's spirits were high because news had come that a committee hearing for Ava's Law had been scheduled.
If passed, Ava's Law would require insurance companies to pay for "evidence-driven treatment" -- or treatment that's been scientifically shown to help kids with an autism spectrum disorder. The law would not affect the self-insured plans offered by bigger companies, which cover about 60% of insured people in the state, according to the Georgia Office of Insurance.
Ava Bullard, 8, sits with her mom, Anna, at a hearing of the insurance committee of the Georgia State Senate.
At age 2, Ava couldn't speak a word. She didn't respond to her name. She barely seemed to recognize her mother.
"She was staying the same, like she was 6 months old," recalls Bullard.
On the Internet, Bullard found stories about children with autism whose worlds were rebuilt through intense therapy. But when a specialist finally offered a formal diagnosis, Bullard was flabbergasted to hear the doctor tell her she could never afford the price tag for "Cadillac" treatment -- tens of thousands of dollars a year. She soon learned her insurance company wouldn't pay a dime.
Last week was Ava's first visit to the state Capitol, but Anna has been prowling the halls since January. On this day she was flanked by Melissa Solares and Megg Andrade, also mothers with children who fall on the autism spectrum. They swapped stories of conversations with legislators, and handed babies to each other when they got too heavy.
A blood test for autism?
Their effort has set off alarm bells with some insurance companies and businesses, which fear the impact of paying upward of $50,000 per child per year for intensive therapy. Supporters counter that the short-term cost is modest, and that paying for early treatment could actually save money by reducing the number of children who need long-term assistance. The advocacy group Autism Speaks estimates that autism costs society $126 billion annually. One influential study from 2007 found the average lifetime cost of caring for a person with autism is $3.2 million, most of it due to lost productivity and adult care.
Georgia is one of 18 states that do not require insurers to pay for autism treatment, according to Judith Ursitti, director of state government affairs for Autism Speaks. She points out that several insurers, including TriCare and the Federal Employee Health Plan, with its 8 million participants, have chosen on their own to cover autism therapy.
Autism Speaks, which supports the Georgia legislation, recently did an analysis of 15 states that require autism coverage. In 2010, the second year after South Carolina passed a mandate, nearly 400,000 individuals with autism received assistance; the direct impact on insurance premiums was barely $5 a year. Among all 15 of those states, the annual impact on premiums ranged from $1.20 in Illinois to $9.96 in Minnesota.
But some have a hard time squaring that view with accounts of people like Bullard and Solares spending tens of thousands of dollars a year on treatment.
"We have a situation where health care costs are rising, and health care costs drive premiums," says Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the largest industry group.
Pisano says that AHIP does not oppose the specific autism mandate but rather mandates in general.
"We're hearing from employers and consumers that they can't afford to pay any more. At the end of the day, it's not the insurer who pays."
Pisano says the insurance group does not have its own studies on the cost -- or long-term savings -- of paying for autism therapy.
State Rep. Richard Smith, head of the insurance committee in the Georgia House, says state law requires any mandate on insurance companies to go through a special committee to study the impact. Smith hasn't taken a stance on the autism bill, but he says well-intentioned mandates often drive up costs to a point where companies stop offering insurance, hurting the very people the mandates were meant to help.
Groups: Autism not to blame for violence
Ursitti dismisses that concern.
"The states that have had this for a while, like Texas and South Carolina and Indiana -- no one is losing their health insurance," she says. "The sky hasn't fallen. What we do know is that families are accessing care for the first time."
State Sen. John Albers, a Republican who sponsored the Georgia Senate version of Ava's Law, calls it "the right thing to do," but also believes it could save the state a lot of money.
"For those of us like myself who are conservative, this is a huge cost savings because we know what it costs when a child needs to be taken care of throughout their lives," says Albers. With early intervention, "I think we're looking at saving up to a million dollars a year, for each child."
The best-established treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders fall under the broad heading of Applied Behavior Analysis -- often referred to as a "behavioral" approach. While there are many variations, it entails intense coaching to teach basic skills that nonautistic children learn more intuitively, especially skills involving communication.
While details are hotly debated, nearly all experts agree: The key is to start early.
"The earlier you start a child in this treatment, and the more intense the treatment, the better they do," says Dr. Michael Morrier, assistant director of the Emory Autism Center at the Emory University School of Medicine.
In one landmark study, among children who began treatment before turning 3, nearly half improved to the point where they were indistinguishable from same-age peers.
The treatment is intensive, often requiring 30 or 40 hours a week in a one-on-one or small group setting. Providers are in high demand and sometimes have to drive hundreds of miles to see children, further adding to the cost.
Melissa Solares says that she and her husband, a surgeon in Augusta, Georgia, spent $115,000 on treatment the year after their son Arturo was first diagnosed.
A "shadow" accompanies Arturo to school each day, and for up to four hours a day after school another aide helps Solares conduct the formal one-on-one coaching that's the hallmark of behavioral therapy. Twice a week, a more experienced therapist visits from South Carolina to make sure the therapy is being done correctly.
It seems to work: When Arturo was diagnosed at age 4, he still wasn't toilet-trained and could speak less than 50 words, Solares recalls. Barely 15 months later, he's speaking in full sentences and attends a regular, private preschool. "He's a completely different child," Solares says.
Kids with autism up 78% in past decade
Her family is stretched thin. If the Georgia bill doesn't become law, she and her husband will be looking to leave the state for one that requires insurance companies to cover Arturo's treatment.
Despite the financial strain, she feels fortunate. "We have resources, but what do people do who have to work all day, if they can't do therapy themselves?" she asks. "Those children just get thrown in a corner and wasted."
Bullard's parents had a college fund set aside that they let the family use for Ava's treatment. Her church and friends in their Vidalia, Georgia, community also pitched in. "We used all the savings we had, and then some credit cards," Bullard says. "We just did whatever."
There were compromises. For example, Ava got one home visit a month instead of the recommended two or three, and each session with the therapist was shorter.
Even so, it paid off. Within two weeks of her first therapy session, Ava was sitting at the dinner table, something she'd never been able to do. Today, she no longer needs intensive treatment -- just one session a week to practice social skills.
Bullard says a mandate would give other children a chance at the same success Ava's had. "She's in third grade, completely indistinguishable from her peers, because treatment works," says Bullard.
Until getting word of the hearing, the three mothers were feeling glum. Even friendly legislators weren't returning calls. At one point, Solares literally ran down a hallway, baby in arms, chasing a senator who had previously pledged support. He didn't look back.
The promise of a hearing offers a ray of hope. It might be too late to get a vote on Ava's Law this spring, but Albers is looking for another bill where the autism mandate might be attached as an amendment. "Anything's possible," he says.
Back at the Senate chamber, Ava is smiling but tired after getting word of the hearing. Near her breaking point, she turns to her mom and says simply, "I'm ready to go home."

School steps up security after California girl's stabbing death
By Paul Vercammen and Ed Payne, CNN
updated 7:10 PM EDT, Mon April 29, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The coroner's office says Leila Fowler died after suffering multiple stab wounds
NEW: Amid stepped up security, parents at her elementary school say they're afraid
NEW: School principal: "I don't think I ever saw Leila without a smile on her face"
The girl's brother "is not a suspect at this time," a sheriff's spokesman says
Valley Springs, California (CNN) -- Sheriff's deputies on foot and in patrol cars made their presence known at a northern California school on Monday.
Amid the stepped up security, classmates at Jenny Lind Elementary School carried flowers for Leila Fowler. Their parents held onto fear.
"I'm scared for my kids, for the family," mother Wendy Converse said. "It's horrible."
Fowler, an 8-year-old third-grader at the school, was stabbed to death at her home over the weekend.
As police search for suspects, word of the killing has left many shaken in the community, which is about an hour outside of Sacramento.
Search for 8-year-old girl's killer
No suspects in girl's stabbing death
"Leila was bubbly, she was vivacious, a great student. ... I don't think I ever saw Leila without a smile on her face," Amy Hasselwander, the school's principal, told CNN affiliate KCRA. "Just a bright girl, just kind, compassionate, sincere to everyone."
Converse said her son, Elijah, was friends with Leila.
"They sit together at school. It's very sad," she said. "Things like that don't happen here."
The girl died of shock and hemorrhages caused by multiple stab wounds, the Calaveras County Coroner's Office said on Monday.
Her mother said the family was still coming to grips with their loss.
"We are devastated," Crystal Walters, Leila's mother, told CNN via Facebook correspondence early Monday. "She didn't deserve this. ... She was so full of life."
No suspect named
Police say Leila and her brother were home alone on Saturday when he saw an intruder leaving the house.
He then found his sister stabbed and severely wounded. She died minutes after arriving at the hospital, authorities said.
Since then, police have been running down leads but say they have no specific suspect.
"We're searching extensively into attics and storage sheds. It is a difficult area to search -- it is rural, remote and the grass is tall right now," Calaveras County Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said.
Authorities have combed the home and the neighborhood for evidence.
"We did collect fingerprints during that search," Macedo said, "and we did collect what we believe to be DNA. Those prints and DNA will hopefully be processed within the next week."
A neighborhood on edge
Word of the killing rattled many residents in the neighborhood.
Michael Range, who lives near the Fowlers, said he heard about Leila's deadly stabbing from a boy who lives nearby.
"I took my kids instantly and locked the doors," he said. "It was scary. We've been inside all weekend."
Ryan Wydner, who lives across the street from the Fowlers, said the girl's death left him feeling anxious.
"Anything's really possible at this point," he said. "What's the difference between that guy going left and right and coming into my house? I don't know."
While authorities said they had "no specific suspect," they are looking for a white or Hispanic male with a muscular build, about 6 feet tall, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. He is considered to be armed and dangerous, the Sheriff's Office said.
Macedo said the boy who found his sister "is not a suspect at this time, but we are continuing to talk to him, which would be normal because he was the last person with the child."
Detectives continue to track down dozens of leads phoned into a tip line created Saturday, including some leading to other counties, he said.
More than 100 members of the law enforcement community are working on this case, Macedo said.

Manchester City crushes United in derby
updated 4:43 PM EDT, Sun September 22, 2013
Sergio Aguero (left) celebrates with Alvaro Negredo (center) and Samir Nasri after scoring Manchester City's third goal against Manchester United and his second of the match. Nasri was criticized for his performance during City's 3-2 defeat in last season's home derby, but he played a key role in Sunday's 4-1 win. The France midfielder celebrates after scoring City's fourth goal. Aguero gave City the lead in the 16th minute with an exquisite volley.
Yaya Toure (right) scored the crucial second goal in time added on to the first half, diverting Negredo's header into the net. With Robin van Persie ruled out by injury before the match, Wayne Rooney was given even more reponsibility for United's attacking fortunes. He was frustrated for much of the match, earning a booking for a tussle with City captain Vincent Kompany, but struck a fine consolation free-kick in the closing minutes. City boss Manuel Pellegrini came out on top in the battle of the Manchester derby debutants, as United manager David Moyes tasted defeat.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Manchester City wins 4-1 in Sunday's derby match against Manchester United
Sergio Aguero scores twice, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri also on target
Wayne Rooney nets late consolation for United in absence of Robin van Persie
Arsenal top of EPL table on goal difference after 3-1 win over Stoke
(CNN) -- David Moyes' first Manchester derby ended in crushing defeat Sunday as his United team suffered an embarrassing 4-1 loss away to English Premier League title rival City.
Moyes, facing the immense task in replacing Alex Ferguson -- the most successful manager in British football history -- could only watch as City netted four times in the first 50 minutes against the defending champion.
Sergio Aguero scored the first and third, Yaya Toure made it 2-0 in first-half injury time and Samir Nasri put the result beyond doubt.
It lifted City up to third in the table, with new manager Manuel Pellegrini vindicated in restoring Alvaro Negredo to the starting lineup as the Spain striker set up two of the goals.

Moyes was robbed of the services of last season's top scorer Robin van Persie, who was ruled out with a groin injury, and Wayne Rooney was unable to continue the resurgent form he has shown up front this season until he curled in a stunning free-kick in the 87th minute.
"Every manager has bad days and bad results. I am no different," Moyes said. "I have been here with Everton many times and I don't think I suffered a defeat like this with Everton.
"I talked with the players the same as I would at any other club. They are good pros here and they know when they are bang at it and when they are not."
While the result echoed City's 6-1 thumping of United at Old Trafford two years ago, which gave Roberto Mancini's men a five-point cushion at the top on the way to a long-awaited league title, this time the victory has merely kept the Light Blues in touch with leading sides Arsenal and Tottenham.
The London clubs ended this weekend with a two-point advantage after Arsenal beat Stoke 3-1, with record signing Mesut Ozil having a hand in all three goals, and Tottenham edged Cardiff 1-0 thanks to an injury-time winner from Paulinho.
United, meanwhile, dropped to eighth in the table with just seven points from five matches -- five behind the top two.
Moyes' team also lost to Liverpool and drew with Chelsea in a difficult run of early fixtures.
"The start to the season could be a lot better," the Scot said. "We did say it could be a difficult start.
"I wasn't convinced when the balls came out of the Premier League bag (for the schedule) and I'm still not convinced."

Pellegrini was understandably pleased with his best result since leaving Spanish club Malaga at the end of last season.
"I'm very happy. The way we played is the way I want this team to play, very similar to against Newcastle (a 4-0 win). We played the way we work all week," the Chilean said.
"We have been playing irregular in other games, but it is normal in this moment of the season. This was a high test today and the players had a great answer."
Aguero put City ahead in the 16th minute as the Argentina striker superbly hooked in a volley from Aleksandar Kolarov's left-wing cross, with Nasri also involved in the move.
Toure pounced for the vital second just before the break, sticking out a knee to divert the ball into the net after Negredo rose highest to head down a corner.
Negredo, signed for $26 million from Sevilla in July, was again the provider just a minute after the restart as he turned and put in the perfect cross for Aguero to volley home a much simpler effort than his first.
Nasri was criticized for his performance in last season's corresponding fixture, a tempestuous 3-2 defeat for City marred by pitch invasions and coin throwing, but he has been a different player this campaign.
Read: Rooney and Ronaldo star in Europe
The France midfielder calmly volleyed in the fourth goal at the far post from a cross by Jesus Navas -- another new addition to City's squad -- after captain Vincent Kompany stopped a United attack and charged upfield.
Rooney is also in significantly better form this season, having flirted with a move to Chelsea but now seemingly committed to United.
The England striker's late corner allowed Patrice Evra to head against the post, and soon after he gave City keeper Joe Hart no chance with his fourth goal in the last three matches.
Arsenal's victory was the club's seventh in a row since losing 3-1 at home to Aston Villa on the opening day of this season.
Manager Arsene Wenger hailed the contribution of Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil, who has settled in quickly since leaving Real Madrid on transfer deadline day.
"Once he is completely integrated we will see even more of him, but he has shown today that he is a great player," said Wenger said.
"Ozil is a player, when you look at his numbers, the assists are not a coincidence, it is just the reality of his game.
"You could see today he has a good pace as well. At the moment he focuses a lot on his passing, but he can create individually as well."
Tottenham needed a moment of magic from Paulinho, one of several new signings, as the Brazil midfielder backheeled the winner at Cardiff from Erik Lamela's pass.
"There could only be one winner," said Spurs coach Andre Villas-Boas.
"We played so much football it would have been unfair to leave here with only one point."
In Sunday's other match, Swansea moved up to ninth with a 2-0 win at promoted Crystal Palace, which stayed second from bottom.
Bottom club Sunderland sacked coach Paolo Di Canio on Sunday, following a 3-0 defeat against West Brom 24 hours earlier.
The Italian was a controversial appointment on March 31 due to his past statements in support of fascism, but he kept the club in the top flight in 17th place.
However, Sunderland has just one point from five games this season.

Obama was right to shake hands with Raul Castro
By Paul Begala, CNN Contributor
updated 8:38 PM EST, Tue December 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
President Obama shook hands with Cuban leader Raul Castro at Mandela's memorial Paul Begala: Like Reagan shaking Gorbachev's hands, Obama's act makes sense
He says even a simple handshake can be potent and transformative Begala: It sends out a ripple of hope from the right side of history Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House.
(CNN) -- There are certain moments of parental pride you know are coming: their first words, first steps, first date. And then there are the ones that blindside you. Like this: The night before the Nelson Mandela memorial service, my 13-year-old son said, "Dad, I'm going to wake up at 4 to watch the Mandela memorial."
I was so proud that he was so inspired. He's an all-star basketball player who mainlines ESPN. Now he wanted to get up in the middle of the night to watch CNN. Great success.
And when President Obama spoke for our nation, I was grateful we'd heard his remarks live. Obama captured President Mandela's remarkable capacity to awaken activism. Across oceans, across continents, across racial divides, across generations, Mandela sparked what Robert F. Kennedy described to the South African people as "ripples of hope."
Paul Begala
One of those ripples of hope inspired a skinny college kid with a funny name who'd been more interested in rebounds than revolution. "Over 30 years ago," Obama said, "while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today."
Same here. Unlike our president, I was always interested in politics. (As an athlete, I was small but slow.) But at the University of Texas, something deeper happened. The Black Student Alliance erected shanties on the West Mall. They challenged their fellow Longhorns to take responsibility for UT's role in apartheid. The university's endowment, flush with billions of petrodollars, invested in corporations that did business in South Africa.
That meant my ridiculously cheap tuition was in some way subsidized by profits from propping up apartheid. I learned names like Biko, Tambo, Sisulu, Tutu and of course, Mandela. Most important, I learned, as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. taught, that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere," that we are all tied into "a seamless garment of destiny."
It was thrilling to be a part, however infinitesimal, of something larger than myself. Even then, with my government on the side of apartheid, I knew we students were on the right side of history. I saved my "Free Nelson Mandela" t-shirt all these years.
This week, I dug it out and showed my sons. I told them about the anti-apartheid movement and how, years later, I joined President Clinton in a White House meeting with Mandela, the prisoner-turned-president. We talked about the confidence that comes from knowing you're on the right side of history.
It is that same confidence that, I believe, was behind Obama's decision to shake the hand of Cuban leader Raul Castro.
Raul's brother, Fidel, had been a steadfast supporter of Mandela's African National Congress, even when the United States was on the wrong side of history. And Mandela never forgot a friend. That is not to excuse the horrendous human rights record of the Castro dictatorship. In his oppression, his censorship, his decades-long war on basic democratic rights, Fidel Castro was the anti-Mandela.
I believe Obama shook Raul Castro's hand for the same reason Reagan shook Gorbachev's or Mandela shook that of F.W. de Klerk, the last president of an apartheid South Africa: because he knows he's on the right side of history.
Years ago, I accompanied Clinton to a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Moments before the President was to speak, I peeked out into the audience, gasped and sprinted back to Clinton's holding room. "Mr. President," I said gravely, "Fidel Castro is on the front row." No one had told us Castro would be there. Clinton was unflappable. "Good," he said. "Maybe he'll learn something."
Clinton stood before Castro and the other assembled world leaders and spoke confidently of "a revolutionary idea: that freedom, freely elected governments, free markets, the free flow of ideas, the free movement of people (are) the surest route to the greatest prosperity for the largest number of people."
I doubt Fidel actually learned much from Clinton's speech. And I am not naive enough to believe Raul Castro will emulate Mandela simply because Obama shook his hand. But I do believe in the transformative, unpredictable power of sending out a ripple of hope from the right side of history. And I was thrilled that Obama's ripple of hope bobbed over a sleepy seventh-grader in the predawn darkness, watching the arc of the moral universe bend toward justice.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese rock star, Cui Jian, has declined to appear on the state broadcaster's annual Lunar New Year television extravaganza, his manager told CNN Wednesday.
The invitation to perform had surprised many because Cui, sometimes called China's "father of rock", had sided with student protesters during the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
"Mr. Cui Jian did indeed receive an invitation from the Spring Festival Gala. However, Mr. Cui Jian ultimately won't perform," his agent, You You, said in an email, without giving further details.

Cui Jian: China's first rock star During the protests in 1989, students on hunger strike on the square adopted Cui's hit "Yiwu Suoyou" (Nothing to my Name) as their anthem.
At the height of the protests, Cui gave an impromptu performance in the square -- days before the government sent in tanks and troops to crack down on the demonstrators.
In the 1990s, authorities refused him permission to perform in big venues due to the political content of his lyrics, state newspaper Global Times reported on its website, although in recent years he has performed at some music festivals.
Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival in China, is the country's biggest holiday and families have traditionally gathered around the TV set on New Year's Eve to watch CCTV 's "Spring Festival Eve Gala."

However, with its cheesy sketches and patriotic songs, the marathon broadcast has lost some of its appeal among audiences recently and organizers have tried to spice it up with performances by international stars like Celine Dion. 0

Cafferty Cheney's secrets?
WATCH "The Cafferty File": Nader in '08?.Vice President Dick Cheney has gone out of his way to keep things from the public. What should be done about it?Dear Jack, For years, the Vice President has been stonewalling Congress by claiming executive privilege. Now, when it suits him, he says that his office is not part of the Executive Branch. As the Church Lady used to say, "How convenient!" -Steve, Montgomery, AlabamaMr. Cheney's refusal to follow the Archives' rules makes him a lawbreaker. He should be treated accordingly. -Louie, New Orleans, LouisianaThis is easy. The VP is responsible to the people of the USA. If he refuses to divulge information required or asked for by the people, he should be impeached by Congress. Unfortunately, this Congress does not think they are responsible to the people, either. -Richard, Coppell, TexasJack, Let’s find out what our esteemed Vice President is hiding, or who he is protecting. I would like to see a congressional Congressional hearing, unless they are too busy. -Terry, Kernersville, North CarolinaCongress wants to revive the Iraq Study Group. Is that a good idea?Did George Bush listen to the Iraq Study Group the 1st time? Nope! Is George Bush gonna listen to them this time? Nope! I just think the Democrats need the Iraq Study Group to give themselves cover when Bush comes to them in September for money to pour down the rat hole Iraq has become. -Patricia, Palmdale, CaliforniaAll I can say is it is a better idea than what we have now. -Josh, Springville, TennesseeJust another non-binding study! We don't need more studies; we need to get out. Oh, I forgot, the Democrats who are in control will get nothing done. -Gene, Houston, Texas

Cafferty: Nader in '08?
WATCH "The Cafferty File": Nader in '08?.If it weren't for Nader taking votes away from Al Gore, we wouldn't be wrecking the world under George Bush, and our young people wouldn't be dying needlessly in Iraq. -JoanJack, Here's what's missing: a candidate who represents the U.S Constitution and has the clout, the guts, and the ability to get elected. -Pete, FloridaNader is what's missing from the White House. Intelligence, integrity and real American values.-Paul, Youngstown, New YorkPerhaps Mr. Nader has a bit of whiplash from slowing down after his "Unsafe at any speed" book came out... Stay out of the race please Ralph. -Frank, Egg Harbor Township, New JerseyDoes the French government have more important things to worry about than the U.S. spying on their BlackBerry messages?Let's face it. Because of the underhanded tactics employed by the current administration, this country is no longer trusted or respected around the world. That is the bigger issue. -Loretta, Cody, WyomingJack, If U.S. citizens no longer trust this government, why should the French? The U.S. government is no longer trustworthy so everybody should be concerned about them. -Vicky, Twin Falls, IdahoThe French should definitely take caution. Every country in the world needs to worry about the United States. I wouldn't put it past the current administration to spy on its allies. And no, there aren't other things the French should be worrying about. The United States is the largest threat in the world. -Dave, TorontoHey, stop ragging on the French. Well over 80% of those eligible voted for president last month. In last fall's mid-term election, the U.S. number was about half of that... We're spying to steal their democracy. -Don, Onset, MassachusettsWhat will it take for Americans' confidence in Congress to rank higher than their confidence in the presidency, the media, big business, HMOs and the criminal justice system?How about a revolution in the streets to wake up Congress? But given the apathetic nature of the average American citizen, I think I'll just complain that nobody has done something about it already. -R., Galion, OhioJack the only thing that would give me confidence in Congress is to start impeachment proceedings against Bush. -Sarah, Orlando, FloridaJack, To restore my confidence in Congress, we would need to get rid of all the incumbent Democrats and Republicans and bring in a whole new bunch, which has not been tainted by a corrupt, money-driven payoff system. -John, Oxnard, Calif.The best way for us to get confidence back in Congress is if they do what I do every single day, get the job done. I have to answer to people just like they do, they're called my bosses. If I don't do my job, guess what will happen? I'll lose my job. Too bad we don't have an option to fire them on the spot when we feel they aren't 'doing their jobs'. If we could, Congress would be pretty empty right now. -Christina, Mentor, Ohio

Cafferty: Declaration of independence?
WATCH "The Cafferty File": Giuliani, a quitter?.How could New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's declaration of independence shake up the '08 presidential race?The biggest plus to a potential Bloomberg run would be that it will put a check on the primary candidates from both parties playing to their respective far-right and far-left bases... if they don't, that middle they are ignoring would propel Bloomberg to victory. -Jeff, Seattle, WashingtonHi Jack. Will Bloomberg affect the 2008 race? Puh-leeze. The only people who believe he could have a meaningful impact are New Yorkers, who think they’re the center of the universe. Just as Rudy is discovering, no one gives a damn about a NYC mayor running for president. Remember John Lindsay? -Kevin, Cleveland, OhioJack, Having lived in the NYC area and watching Mike Bloomberg, I think he makes an excellent choice for president... By relinquishing his ties to either of the two parties, he strengthens his ability to actually tackle tough issues and get something done in Washington in a non-partisan way... I think the mood in the country is right for someone like Mike Bloomberg to take Washington back for its citizens. He might even ask you to be his running mate, Jack. -Wayne, Oakwood Hills, IllinoisWell, if Bloomberg has declared his independence, good for him. He is probably as fed up as the rest of us, and frankly I believe the '08 race could stand a shake-up. This current crop of candidates, with the exception of Edwards and Obama, are a crushing disappointment.-Monna, Charlotte, North CarolinaIs it a good idea for the Bush administration to delay tighter border security on the Mexican and Canadian borders?It is always understood that when implementing new procedures there will be delays, but one would think that 2 years would be a sufficient amount of time to work out the bugs in the system. I think it may be time to cancel all vacations and holidays for those running the bureaucracy. -CrystalJack, Of course securing our borders would have been the first thing a fourth grader did after that horrific day in September. But this is the Republican labor so it's about slave labor and getting the Latino vote. Everything on our beloved Earth has a price in America. Don't attempt to adjust your set. This nightmare is real! -Bob, Pensacola, FloridaThe Department of Homeland Security’s "hiccup" is just more smoke and mirrors from the White House to enable the continued delay in implementing real border security. The Land of the Free, Home of the Brave is fast becoming just a hand puppet in Mexico's control. -John, Williamsport, PennsylvaniaShould Army combat tours be once again extended from 15-months?I can't speak for our troops but when I was in the military two things excited me: mail and the date that I would go home. Having my tour of duty extended from 12 months to 15 months along with repeated tours would demoralize the guys that I served with. I can only assume that our troops in Iraq would feel the same. -Don, Dodge City, KansasHow can an administration claim to support our troops by not providing them with a proper war plan or proper armor and supplies, by using contractors that rob the U.S. blind, and of course, by extending their tours every chance they get? And further, why can't the Democrats push this point through? -Thomas, San Jose, CaliforniaI don't think we have much choice but to extend their tours in Iraq. I hate to think how fatigued our military will be if we actually have a real conflict worth fighting for! We are less safe than ever in that respect! -Cameron, Norfolk, Virginia

Cafferty: Cash rewards for poor?
WATCH "The Cafferty File": Code names in '08?.Is it a good idea to give the poor cash rewards for things like graduating high school, going to the doctor and working full-time?Of course it's worthwhile, if it's the only way to coerce people into helping themselves. Isn't it a sort of axiom that poor people would be more successful if they made better choices? The question is whether they recognize the more beneficial choices. Education, Education, Education.-Jim, Tampa, FloridaMoney for the poor because they graduate and get a job? No way. What a joke. I've heard it all now. These are things people should do. -AnonymousCertainly there are two kinds of people who are poor: those who have suffered bad luck, either by birth or through circumstances beyond their control, and those who have made bad choices. This program may be able to help the latter group. And it certainly cannot hurt the former. People naturally respond to incentives. If healthy children and better prospects for life do not provide enough incentives, maybe money will. -K., Carmel, IndianaNo, no, no. We expect so little of the population; good behavior should be expected not rewarded. This is the problem there is no standard to rise to! -Sheela, Las Vegas, NevadaI can't believe this. I live in NYC, home to many of the crummiest schools in the US. I struggled to get my boys through school. I sat with them for hours doing homework and projects. But this is beside the point. This is nothing more than organized bribery. Where is self respect? Where is pride? -Linda, New YorkShould U.S. combat troops in Iraq be given one month off for every three months they spend fighting?As a soldier who has been deployed to Iraq twice and is preparing for a third deployment, I believe that having one month off for every three months deployed would be detrimental to our mission. For the most part, soldiers have plenty of time to themselves between missions. More time off would encourage complacency, and due to the rapidly changing environment in Iraq, would cause soldiers to be unprepared for the missions they would be assigned to after their time off. -DanielEnough with all this nonsense. Bring them home where they belong. -Wesley, Somerville, MassachusettsJack, You can tell when people who have never been in combat, or Iraq for that matter, come up with ideas on helping troops. To help veterans deal with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is simple: shorten the deployments to six months. It only takes one attack, and seeing your buddy die in your arms to develop PTSD for life. If troops got to go home earlier and deal with trauma, maybe the PTSD would not ingrain itself in the veterans. -RoyI wholeheartedly agree that the troops should be given time off from the stress of trying to stay alive. If it takes a month to do that, so be it. It is unforgivable that our government asks our men to be there as long as they do. -Elsie, Waynesboro, TennesseeDid Rudy Giuliani make a mistake by quitting the Iraq Study Group panel?Yes, he certainly made a mistake, and I'm so happy that you have brought it to our attention. My opinion of Rudy Giuliani keeps going down the more I listen to him, or hear other facts like this about him. Thank you for making the picture clearer. -Lynne, Fort Mohave, ArizonaHe simply made a rational Republican decision on public vs. self service. -Pete, ArkansasJack, Of course Giuliani made a huge and unforgivable mistake by not attending vital Iraq Study Group meetings. It would be an even bigger mistake if we rewarded him by electing him to the highest office in the land. -Dorian, Austin, TexasOf course not. He was undoubtedly tipped off that no one in the White House would pay any attention to their findings. -Nathan, New York Posted By Jack Cafferty, CNN Commentator: 6/19/2007 05:41:00 PM ET | Permalink

Cafferty: Code names & candidates?
WATCH "The Cafferty File": Bush's dream?.What's an appropriate secret service code name for any of the '08 presidential candidates?Hilary Clinton: Iceberg. -Bob, Phillips, WisconsinRomney: Chameleon. -Dot, Manahawkin, New JerseyJack, code names for these jokers have the same value as their promises. Simply take the names of the seven dwarfs, three stooges, five Looney Toon characters, and six different types of nuts - put them in a hat and randomly draw a name for each. -Frank, Connellsville, PennsylvaniaSenator Clinton: "The Queen Bee". Fred Thompson: "Maybe". Mitt Romney: "Flipper and Flopper". -Valerie, Raleigh, North CarolinaWhat does it mean if Iraq now ranks as the world's second most unstable country, behind only Sudan?Jack, It means that everything the neocons say will happen if we leave is already happening there now. -Patty, Marietta, GeorgiaJack, It means we have no hope of installing a democracy and we should withdraw our soldiers from the middle of their civil war. -Laura, Houston, TexasIt only means what we all know, that Bush's policy of spreading democracy through violence is a total failure. -Kyle, Denver, ColoradoMaybe, just maybe we can stop hearing from Washington's professional liars that we are making "progress" in Iraq. -George, FloridaAl Gore says "The planet is in distress and all of the attention is on Paris Hilton." Is he right?Mr. Gore is not entirely correct, but close. Ms. Hilton is only one of the distractions, along with American Idol, Am I Smarter Than A 5-Year Old, Survivor re-runs, and the ultimate reality show: Comprehensive Immigration Reform. All serve to distract the public from other issues, some of which are valid and others which are not. -Dan, VancouverWhen watching the coverage on Paris Hilton I wondered how, when our soldiers are dying, is this important? Maybe if that much coverage was dedicated to the war and the deaths of our bravest and brightest this country would revolt against this administration and the senseless war they have gotten us into. -Lisa, Ft. Jennings, OhioAl Gore is correct. Give the electorate their Paris Hiltons, cheap goods from Wal-Mart and their NFL Football... and it keeps them asleep. That way the politicians can go about their business of making the corporations rich at the expense of the environment. -Louie, Platteville, WisconsinNo, Al Gore is not right. What could be more important then Paris Hilton's jail time, Britney Spears' shaved head, or Lindsay Lohan's car accident? I was told years ago that the mission was accomplished in Iraq, global warming was not a scientific fact, and that Afghanistan was under control. -Evan, New York
