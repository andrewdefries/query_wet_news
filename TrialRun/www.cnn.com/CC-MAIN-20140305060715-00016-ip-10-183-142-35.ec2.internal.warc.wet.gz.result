(CNN) -- The year in science and technology ran the gamut, shedding new light on the past while also foreshadowing a more dynamic future.Google, digital music, wireless technologies and blogs all boomed in 2004. But there were also plenty of battles, such as efforts to fight human and computer viruses and reel in online ID theft. The year in technologyAs many innovations as challenges emerged in the technology arena in 2004. Personal technology lived up to its name more than ever, with miniature devices that seamlessly delivered high-quality audio and visual content. However, the banes of Internet users everywhere -- spam, computer viruses and spy programs -- made surfing the Web much more aggravating and confusing.Google's IPOGoogle's unconventional IPO gave investors a roller coaster ride before settling down and valuing the Internet search company in the billons of dollars. (CNN/Money: Google-goo at Nasdaq)Portable audioThe runaway success of Apple's iPod -- and a growing catalogue of digital competitors -- means that personal audio devices will be adding more memory, longer battery life and new features. (The Steve Jobs way)Digital music stores succeedApple's iTunes claimed to have sold more than 100 million songs by 2004, even as a host of other competitors sprang up to offer alternatives to peer-to-peer file sharing. (Special Report: Online Music Revolution)Spam, spyware and adwareSpam overtook the volume of legitimate e-mail as companies, the government and consumers struggled to stanch the flood of unwanted mail and invasive programs, like spyware and adware.ID theft and phishing scamsA new wave of ID thieves attacked consumers, in some cases swiping credit card numbers and personal information from tens of thousands of customers in a single operation. (Full story)BloggingInternet diarists were noticed more than ever, even playing a role in the presidential election and in calling the major media corporations to account. Dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named "blog" the most looked-up word on its Web site. (Bloggers get convention credentials)E-votingComputer experts say they did not detect major discrepancies with e-voting technology, but, due to a lack of verifiable data to compare against, they warned that few ways exist to detect malfunctions or fraud. (Full story)Hybrid vehiclesThe booming popularity of hybrid cars such as the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius propelled the market far beyond early expectations, with hundreds of thousands of the vehicles on the road by the end of the year. (Full story)Wireless revolution Two rovers, like those in the graphic shown here, examined Mars' surface.The spread of high-speed Internet -- through Wi-Fi and sometimes even municipal wireless networks -- took off, promising to once again change our relationship with technology. (Special Report: Wireless life)Computer virusesNetsky-P was the hardest-hitting virus of 2004, disrupting tens of thousands of businesses and homes worldwide, while other viruses also exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Windows operating system. (Sasser worm rips through Internet)The year in scienceScience stories this year chronicled everything from ecological destruction in the seas to the amazing accomplishments of entrepreneurs in space. Many of the achievements of 2004 bode well for an exciting 2005, when these scientific advances can start to fulfill their promise.Large fish goneA new global study found that large fish have been almost completely stripped from the oceans, with just 10 percent of large individuals of species such as tuna, swordfish and marlin left.Mars roversTwo Mars rovers, Opportunity and Spirit, exceeded all expectations by roaming the red planet for months. The images and Martian surface data the rovers sent back marked a stunning achievement for NASA. (Full story)Debate over Kyoto protocols, climate changeThe Kyoto protocols went into effect for many countries, though not the United States, sparking a global market in carbon credits and highlighting the alarming implications of global warming.Hurricane season A higher than average number of hurricanes pounded the East Coast, particularly Florida. The season also shaped up the costliest ever, causing more than $20 billion in damages. (Special Report: Hurricane season) X Prize SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of 377,591 feet (71 1/2 miles) to win the Ansari X Prize .SpaceShipOne became the first private spacecraft to leave the Earth's atmosphere carrying a passenger-size payload and return, making the flight three times to win the $10 million Anasari X Prize and become a beacon for space tourism.

(Ripples detected in Saturn ring; Hopes to salvage Genesis science)Save Hubble movement NASA's initial proposal to abandon the Hubble Space Telescope evoked outrage and spurred the agency to search for a way to save the observatory from a fiery re-entry.

Al-Sadr extends Mehdi Army cease-fireStory Highlights NEW: Iraqi prime minister welcomes al-Sadr stand down order Influential Shiite cleric gives stand-down order another six months 15 bodies found in mass grave near Baquba, Iraqi official says UNICEF reports measles outbreak in Anbar province Next Article in World » From Mohammed Tawfeeq CNN BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has extended for six months the cease-fire he imposed last summer on his Mehdi Army militia, al-Sadr's office in Baghdad said Friday. A Baghdad street is reflected in the glass over a poster of powerful Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The official said a letter was distributed to all al-Sadr offices announcing the extension of the suspension, credited by the U.S. military with helping reduce the sectarian violence that has engulfed Baghdad and other hot spots across the country. The cease-fire is "an important commitment that can broadly contribute to further improvements in security for all Iraqi citizens," said a U.S. military statement delivered by Navy Cmdr. Scott Rye. "It will also foster a better opportunity for national reconciliation and allow the coalition and Iraqi security forces to focus more intensively on al Qaeda terrorists," the statement said, referring to the predominantly Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq. The Iraqi government on Friday welcomed the decision. "This step will contribute to the establishment of security and support of the national unity, and push forward the efforts of rebuilding and construction," Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in a statement. He called the Sadrists a "cornerstone in the political process." The cease-fire was announced in late August after pitched battles in Karbala and other cities between the militia and fighters aligned with its Shiite rival, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

There were questions as to whether al-Sadr would continue his cease-fire. There had been some anger in the Shiite community over operations by the U.S. and Iraqi militaries, which have been going after Shiite militants who have ignored the call the stand down. Rogue followers of al-Sadr are thought to be among the recalcitrant militants. "Those who honor al-Sadr's pledge will be treated with respect and restraint," the U.S. military said. "Those who dishonor the Sadr pledge are regrettably tarnishing both the name and the honor of the movement." Other developments • Fifteen bodies were discovered Thursday in a mass grave about 10 miles north of Baquba, the capital of Diyala province, an Iraqi army official said. • UNICEF on Friday reported a measles outbreak centered in Anbar province. The agency has confirmed 27 cases of the disease, which can cause brain damage, blindness and immune system deficiencies. A five-day emergency immunization campaign in the Anbar cities of Hit and Ramadi seeks to reach every child between ages 1 and 5. • A U.S. Marine was killed in action Thursday in Anbar province, west of Baghdad, the U.S. military said Friday. An Army soldier also died, of non-combat causes, the military said. Since the start of the war, 3,970 U.S. troops have died in Iraq, including 26 this month. • A car rigged with explosives blew up in Tikrit in northern Iraq on Friday, killing two police officers and wounding six others, police said. E-mail to a friend CNN's Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.

Twister strikes western Puerto Rico; at least 4 injuredBy the CNN Wire Staff Tornado touches down in Puerto RicoSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: The stadium set to host the Central American games is damagedNEW: Four people have been injuredNEW: The twister downed cables and damaged carsA tornado touches down on Puerto Rico's western coast (CNN) -- A tornado touched down in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Saturday afternoon, injuring at least four people and leaving the area without electricity, according to emergency officials. The twister struck Mayaguez, on Puerto Rico's western coast, at 12:35 p.m., according to Luis Correa, a spokesman for the State Emergency Department. Video showed twisted scaffolding and crushed cars, among other structural damage at a stadium set to host the 21st Central and Caribbean Games beginning Saturday night. Cables were also downed, causing the area to lose power, officials said. The start of the games, featuring hundreds of athletes in a variety of sports from more than 30 countries, has been postponed until Sunday, officials said. Strong winds remained in the area after the tornado had passed through as workers at the stadium rushed to secure tents and lighting towers, video showed. The four injured were taken to a local hospital where they are in stable condition, said Janita Soto, a spokeswoman for the Mayaguez police. Two of the injured were hurt "when they were running out of fear," said Sandra Virella, an emergency department spokeswoman. CNN's Jackie Castillo contributed to this report.

First year in Formula One
1978
(CNN) -- Williams' form in recent years has not been befitting of a team boasting one of Formula One's richest legacies.
The British marque have collected nine constructors' titles in an illustrious 34-year history, a total only bettered by the legendary Ferrari.
Ferrari and McLaren are the only teams to have won more drivers' titles than the British-based outfit's seven crowns, but founder and boss Frank Williams last lifted a championship trophy in 1997 with a clean sweep of the sport's major honors.
Without a race win since Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya claimed the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix, Williams will want to improve on a 2011 campaign which recorded just five points and a ninth-place finish in the constructors' standings.
Pastor Maldonado
The Venezuelan became only the fourth driver from his country to compete in the elite division of motorsport, and the first in 27 years, when he made his debut at the 2011 Australian Grand Prix.
But Maldonado's breakthrough season was tough and ended with just one world championship point and six retirements in 19 races.
The 26-year-old's solitary point came thanks to a 10th placing at August's Belgian Grand Prix. It was a rare highlight in a season which saw Maldonado struggle with the unreliable FW33 car.
With the state-owned Venezuelan energy company PDSVA backing Williams, Maldonado will hope to prove he has been retained based on his talents rather than his sponsors.
Bruno Senna
When the Brazilian gets behind the wheel of an F1 car, he brings with him the ghost of one of the sport's greatest champions.
Bruno's uncle Ayrton Senna was a three-time world champion and a hero in Brazil before he died following a crash in San Marino in 1994.
Ayrton was driving for Williams at the time of his fatal accident, in just his third race after leaving McLaren -- making the team's decision to replace another Brazilian, the veteran Rubens Barrichello, with Bruno all the more meaningful.
After a stop-start career to date, which has included stints with F1 newcomers Lotus and HRT, the 28-year-old Bruno will be hoping 2012 is the year he finally steps out of his uncle's shadow.

updated 5:21 AM EST, Thu December 20, 2012
This year's Best Business hotel winner, the Georges, is a tiny gem of a boutique hotel, hidden in an art nouveau mansion on a narrow cobbled lane in Istanbul's Galata district. Inspired by Paris's hotels particuliers, the Georges is decorated with dark parquet floors, bespoke brass fixtures, ornamental plaster panels and handcrafted wood furnishings by local artisans. Most of its 21 rooms have balconies overlooking the Bosphorus. But what makes this place irresistible for business or leisure is that each room comes with its own private butler on hand for any request. Runner up in the Wallpaper list, and relaunched after a luxurious AU$65m ($68m) makeover earlier this year, Park Hyatt Sydney is a low-slung sandstone structure located within the historic rocks district on Sydney Harbour's Campbell's Cove. There are 155 rooms, including three new rooftop suites adjacent to the pool on the fourth floor, all of which have balconies with a view. The prestigious Sydney Suite is the grandest with almost 360-degree views of the bridge, harbor and opera house.
Located in Mexico City's Centro Historico, Downtown is housed in one of the capital's few remaining 17th-century palaces.
Originally known as the Palacio de los Condes de Miravalle, Downtown has a red volcanic rock façade, traditional handmade tiles in the rooms, perfectly manicured patios, and a stone-forged staircase dating from the colonial period.
Located in Porto Feliz, 100km away from the bustling business hub of Sao Paulo, the Fasano Boa Vista resort boasts was designed by Brazilian architect, Isay Weinfeld. The complex spans 12 million square meters of virgin landscape, a third of which is covered by natural forest and natural lakes.
Hong Kong's Jervois makes the most of its location in the heart of Sheung Wan's hive of shops, galleries and restaurants.
The third development from local National Properties Holdings, Jervois was designed by two Frenchmen, Florent Nédélec (exteriors) and Christian Liaigre (interiors). The top five penthouse floors overlook Victoria Harbour.
This industrial building on the Brooklyn waterfront is now the Wythe Hotel, a 72-room facility with original exposed brickwork, arched windows and cast-iron columns. A former cooperage dating from 1901, the hotel's common areas and bar are located in a striking new rooftop glass box extension.
NoMad is a new hotel housed in a turn-of-the-century Beaux-Arts building in the New York's NoMad neighbourhood (north of Madison Square Park).
The hotel houses a grand library that comes complete with an eclectic literary collection.
The legendary Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles is awash with Hollywood glitz and glamour, as emphasized by the Grace Kelly suite (pictured).
Its Spanish colonial façade remains a bright shade of pink, and the decor takes inspiration from the 12 acres of gardens that surround the hotel.
The vast enterance lobby of the Conservatorium hotel in Amsterdam. The building also features a library and indoor garden.
A former bank and music school, the building has been transformed by architect and designer, Piero Lissoni, into something altogether more airy and light-filled.
The Four Seasons Pudong is located in Shanghai's financial district, on the east side of the bustling Huangpu River.
The property is the four seasons second in Shanghai -- a sign of just how bullish the hotel group is about China in general and Shanghai in particular. Housed in an elegant 1870s Haussmann building opposite the Opera Garnier, the W Paris has been designed by architecture and interior design specialists Rockwell Group Europe. An oversized backlit digital wall takes centre stage in the lobby, while historic features such as vaulted ceilings and marble staircases have been partially restored.
Hotelier Florian Weitzer's second property, the Hotel Daniel in Vienna is an intimate boutique hotel located steps from the city's historic Schloss Belvedere.
Designed by architects Atelier Heisse, Hotel Daniel is filled with a mix of antique and contemporary pieces by local designers.

Three years later, no sign of missing family
By Gabriel Falcon, CNN
updated 10:12 AM EST, Sat January 26, 2013
Joseph McStay; his wife, Summer; and their two children, Gianni and Joseph Mateo, have not been heard from since the night of February 4, 2010.
Joseph McStay, with son Gianni, is "loving, fun, genuine," brother Mike McStay says on his website.
Mike McStay calls sister-in-law Summer McStay an "incredible mom."
Gianni and Joseph "Joey" McStay open gifts in an undated family photo. Older sibling Gianni McStay
Younger sibling Joseph McStay would be 6 now. Summer McStay had stayed home to raise the children but planned to return to work before the family's disappearance, her brother-in-law said.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
McStay family went missing nearly three years ago
Surveillance video shows four people of similar size crossing into Mexico
Relatives dispute author's claim that wife was involved in disappearance
(CNN) -- Susan Blake writes her son Joseph all the time. "I send him e-mails," she says, "keeping him updated on what's going on."
Each e-mail goes unanswered. All she can do is hope that he sees them.
It's how she copes with one of the most unsettling and baffling missing persons cases in recent years: the mystery of the McStay family.
Next week marks the third anniversary of the disappearance of Joseph McStay, 43; his wife, Summer, 46; and their two young children, Gianni, 7, and Joseph Mateo, who would be 6 this month.
2010: No trace of missing family
2011: The missing McStay family case
February 4, 2010 was the last day anyone saw the family or heard from them. When police entered their Southern California house more than 10 days later, they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room. Their two dogs were also in the home. But not a single trace of the McStays.
2010: California police search for missing family
Did they voluntarily leave? Are they in Mexico? Are they in danger? Are they dead?
Despite hundreds of tips and several high-profile television reports and interviews, no one has a clue.
"This is definitely an unusual case," says Lt. Glenn Giannantonio of the San Diego Sheriff's Department's homicide division "At this point we are no closer to finding them than on the day they disappeared. I know that sounds horrible, but we just don't know what happened to them."
The sentiment is shared by Dennis Brugos, who led the sheriff's department investigation into the McStays' disappearance before retiring last year. "Nothing makes any kind of rational sense that you can put together," Brugos says.
The McStays lived on a cul-de-sac in Fallbrook. Described on its website as the "friendly village," Fallbrook is about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and some 50 miles north of San Diego.
Joseph McStay owned Earth Inspired Products, a company that built custom water features for high-end commercial businesses around the world, says Mike McStay, his younger brother. Summer stayed home to raise the children, but according to Mike was planning on getting back to work.
The family's locked and abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located February 8, 2010, in San Ysidro, just two blocks from the border. Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico.
"If you look at the clothing that they were wearing at the time, it coincides with when the vehicle was found; it leads you to believe that that was them crossing the border," Brugos says. "I can't say definitively it's them, but it's a high probability."
Giannantonio agrees. "We do believe the family on the tape going into Mexico is that of the McStays, " he says.
But Joseph's mother isn't convinced.
"My son's meds were in that car," she tells CNN. "My son has asthma and doesn't go anywhere without the meds on him. And to have babies go without car seats. This is the stuff that doesn't add up."
Mike McStay says he is not sure if the family is on the video. "The best is that the children appear to be size appropriate, but I could never get an ID off the adult. Even if it were them crossing, we still don't know to what intent. We don't know if it was under duress or willingly."
However, he says he believes someone has an answer. "How does somebody not see them?" he wonders. "They have to go get groceries, get the basic necessities of life; they have to have a way to generate an income. There has to be something.
I want what everyone wants, a phone call, a letter, something. I don't want to know why he left. Mike McStay, brother of Joseph McStay
"My brother is out there. I want what everyone wants, a phone call, a letter, something. I don't want to know why he left. We just have to know that they are OK."
Mike McStay is familiar with the theories speculating on what might have happened, including one presented in the new book, "No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family."
Author Rick Baker says his own investigation, including reviewing hundreds of personal e-mails, shows that Summer and Joseph were having problems and that their relationship was, in his words, about to "explode."
Baker speculates, among other things, that at least one of the family members may have met with foul play.
Mike McStay bristles when asked to comment on Baker's suggestion. "I don't know how he sleeps at night," McStay says of the author. "I suspect he's looking for money. He's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things. He's just trying to sell books."
Blake, the mother, says there were many inaccuracies in the book. "It was very hard to read all this, very heartbreaking, the accusations."
She says, "The bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family, sad to say."
Giannantonio cautions there is no evidence of any criminal activity. "Everything leads us to believe the disappearance is voluntary. It's still categorized as a missing persons case," he says.
"We have to rely on facts and evidence. We don't want to publicize unsubstantiated theories. Everyone has theories, however we can't come out and say this is what actually happened unless we have something to back that up. Other people can, but that's not the business we are in."
Brugos says he thinks anything is possible. "If you are staying together as a group, as a family of four, it's probably a little more difficult. If you want the kids to go to school, questions are asked, and with the Internet everybody is an amateur detective."
Mike and his mother get reported sightings of the McStays on a regular basis. They come from all over the country. Mike, who says he chases them all down, recently received a tip from Belize, where his brother owned property.
"Every time one comes your heart pumps and you hope to God that this is it," Blake says, "and when it's not you fall apart. It's heartbreaking and very hard."
She isn't giving up. Neither is Mike, though both are mindful that ultimately the truth could be devastating.
"Until my dying day I will try to resolve this thing. I have to know where my brother and my family are," Mike says. "I'm going to have to stick with this for the rest of my life. Until we have closure. So that we can have some peace. I know all of us need peace."
Blake says the search for her family is the biggest fight of her life. "I refuse to give up. I hope to God, but at the same time it's been three years.
"How can a family of four just disappear?"

Poachers in Zimbabwe poison 87 elephants for ivory, official says

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Poachers have used cyanide to kill more than 80 elephants in Zimbabwe, park official says

Environment minister says he will push for tougher penalties for ivory poachers
Conservationists say record numbers of elephants are dying to meet soaring demand
Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- More than 80 elephants in Zimbabwe have been poisoned with cyanide -- the latest victims of poachers keen to feed soaring global demand for illegally trafficked ivory.
Since May, the carcasses of 87 elephants have been discovered in Hwange National Park, said Caroline Washaya-Moyo, public relations manager for Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority.
The poachers poisoned natural salt licks to bring down the mighty beasts, she said Wednesday.
The parks authority has so far recovered 51 tusks, she said -- leaving 123 in the hands of the poachers.
Zimbabwe's newly appointed Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere told CNN that he would push for stiffer jail penalties to root out poaching in the wildlife-rich African nation.

"That will be one of my missions in the new parliament, given the recent case of elephants which were poisoned by poachers," said Kasukuwere, who has twice visited the park in recent days to see the impact of the poisoning.
Last month authorities arrested five suspected poachers after 41 elephants were found dead in the park, which is about 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Harare, not far from Zimbabwe's border with Zambia. The other carcasses have been discovered since then, Washaya-Moyo said.
Three of those arrested have been convicted and are due to be sentenced this week, she said. Two investigations are ongoing.
Poaching stinks... and now dogs are sniffing it out
Call for tougher action
The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, an anti-poaching organization, said the latest elephant deaths could have been avoided if Harare was tougher on those convicted of poaching.
"They need to be given some extensive jail time. If it was, they wouldn't carry on doing it," said the organization's chairman, Johnny Rodrigues.
He accused Zimbabwe of not doing enough to clamp down on poachers and of creating an impression that the country had more elephants than it can sustain.
"They want permission from CITES to sell the ivory they have in stock and they think they will get it if there are too many elephants here," Rodrigues said, referring to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
CITES, also known as the Washington Convention, aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants is kept to a minimum to avoiding threatening their existence.
Rodrigues puts the country's elephant population at around 35,000, while Washaya-Moyo said it was about 45,000.
The use of cyanide could also have a wider impact, Rodrigues said. "When other animals and birds feed on the rotting elephant carcasses, they will also die from the poison. Hundreds of animals are now at risk," he said.
The police suspect there could be more elephant carcasses in the park that have not yet been discovered, he added.
The Parks and Wildlife Management Authority warned that wildlife poaching syndicates in Zimbabwe "have become sophisticated and need appropriate responses to effectively deal with them."
'Killed in record numbers'
The International Fund for Animal Welfare and the WWF conservation group said that a recent surge in the illicit ivory trade has resulted in the killing of 30,000 African elephants annually in recent years.
The International Fund for Animal Welfare, which published a major study into the illegal wildlife trade in June, calculates that an elephant loses its life to poaching on average every 15 minutes.
"Elephants were killed for their ivory in record numbers in 2011 and 2012, and some rhinoceros subspecies have become extinct or are on the verge of extinction," it said.
"Rangers are regularly killed by poachers, and some of the world's poorest countries continue to see their wildlife decimated for the black market in wild animals and parts. Meanwhile, the profits realized from the illegal trade in wildlife have surged to levels once reserved for legally traded precious metals.
"Criminal and violent groups around the world have become the main actors exploiting this global industry."
Elephants under siege
Demand in Asia, United States
Much of the demand for ivory, as well as rhinoceros horn, is in Asia, and particularly China, where these items are used in traditional medicines and handicraft products, the report said.
The United States is widely considered to be the second-largest destination for illegally trafficked wildlife in the world, it said, with the European Union third.
Authorities in the United States have spoken out against the illegal trade in recent weeks.
Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced this month that nearly six tons of elephant ivory seized by U.S. wildlife inspectors would be destroyed to highlight the issue.
"Rising demand for ivory is fueling a renewed and horrific slaughter of elephants in Africa, threatening remaining populations across the continent," Jewell said.
"We will continue to work aggressively with the departments of Justice and State, as well as with international law enforcement agencies, to disrupt and prosecute criminals who traffic in ivory, and we encourage other nations to join us in that effort."
The ivory stockpile, which includes whole tusks as well as smaller carvings and jewelry, has been kept at a secure site in Colorado, where it will be crushed and destroyed next month. Commercial ivory trade has been banned in the United States since 1989.
The Clinton Foundation is also working with conservation groups to try to halt the gruesome trade in tusks, by combating poaching and trafficking, and by educating consumers so they no longer buy ivory.
Chelsea Clinton wrote last month that elephant poaching had reached alarmingly high levels -- and was an issue with implications for global society.
"This is not just an ecological disaster; it is an economic and security threat as well," she said. "Tourism, a vital source of income for many of the most-affected African countries, is threatened if wildlife preserves are depopulated.
"The overall black market for illegal wildlife trade has become the fourth most lucrative criminal activity internationally, after drugs, counterfeit goods and human trafficking."
