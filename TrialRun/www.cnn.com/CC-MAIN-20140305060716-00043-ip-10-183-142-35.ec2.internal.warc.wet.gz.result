Justices uphold ban on abortion procedure
Story Highlights• 5-4 ruling could open door to revisiting Roe v. Wade • Justice Kennedy: Law does not violate constitutional right to abortion • New justices Alito, Roberts provided solid conservative majority to uphold ban • Federal law has never gone into effect pending court rulings By Bill Mears CNN Washington BureauAdjust font size:
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a law that banned a type of late-term abortion, a ruling that could portend enormous social, legal and political implications for the divisive issue.The sharply divided 5-4 ruling could prove historic. It sends a possible signal of the court's willingness, under Chief Justice John Roberts, to someday revisit the basic right to abortion guaranteed in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case.President Bush, who signed the law in 2003 and appointed two of the justices who upheld it, said the prohibition "represents a commitment to building a culture of life in America.""Today's decision affirms that the Constitution does not stand in the way of the people's representatives enacting laws reflecting the compassion and humanity of America," he said in a statement released by the White House.At issue is the constitutionality of a federal law banning a rarely performed type of abortion carried out in the middle-to-late second trimester. (Watch how the decision might affect Roe vs. Wade )The legal sticking point was that the law lacked a "health exception" for a woman who might suffer serious medical complications, something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions.In the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote in these divided appeals, said the federal law "does not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right." He was joined by his fellow conservatives, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Roberts.Sole woman on bench reads bitter dissentIn a bitter dissent read from the bench, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only woman on the high court, said the majority's opinion "cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court, and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives."She called the ruling "alarming" and noted the conservative majority "tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases" by doctor's groups, including gyncecologists.The Justice Department and abortion rights groups have offered differing views of the legislation's impact on women's overall second trimester access to the procedure, and whether the procedure is ever medically necessary.This was the first time the high court had heard a major abortion case in six years, and since then, its makeup has changed, with Roberts and Alito now on board. Their presence on the bench provided the solid conservative majority needed to allow the federal ban to go into effect, with Kennedy providing the key fifth vote for a majority.Alito replaced Sandra Day O'Connor, a key abortion rights supporter over her quarter century on the bench."A lot of us wish that Alito weren't there and O'Connor were there," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who opposed Alito's nomination, said.Doctors call this type of late-term abortion an "intact dilation and evacuation." Abortion foes term it a "partial-birth abortion."Three federal appeals courts had ruled against the government, saying the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 is unconstitutional because it does not provide a "health exception" for pregnant women facing a medical emergency. The outcome of this latest challenge before the court's new ideological makeup could turn on the legal weight given past rulings on the health exception.In states where such exceptions are allowed, the lists of possible health risks include severe blood loss, damage to vital organs and loss of fertility. Court briefs noted pregnant women having the procedure most often have their health threatened by cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure or risk of stroke. Doctors are given the discretion to recommend when the late-term procedure should be performed.The federal law has never gone into effect, pending the outcome of nearly three years of legal appeals.Specifically, the ban encompasses what doctors call "intact dilation and evacuation" (also known as IDX), which Congress in its legislation termed inhumane.It is a rarely used second-trimester procedure, designed to reduce complications to the woman. More common is "dilation and evacuation" (D&E), used in 95 percent of pre-viability second-trimester abortions, according to Planned Parenthood. Both are generally performed after the 21st week of pregnancy.A major part of the legal dispute was whether the federal ban also includes the relatively more common "standard D&E abortions." The government contends the law does not, and is sufficiently narrow not to place an "undue burden" on a woman's reproductive choices.Raw numbers were also at the heart of the debate, because the two sides disagreed on how often the procedure is performed. Solicitor General Paul Clement, the Justice Department's top lawyer before the court, suggested it is rarely performed, and that other medical options are available, so banning it would therefore not be a real barrier to women.Abortions rights supporters say "intact" abortions are a medically accepted pre-viability, second-trimester procedure.Since the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, some states have tried to place restrictions and exceptions on access to the procedure, prompting a string of high court "clarifications" on the issue over the years.

To: Interested parties From: John King, CNN chief national correspondent Re: The Monday Memo Washington (CNN) -- It is a week to remember a defining moment of the 20th century -- the fall of the Berlin Wall. And a week to remember the victims of an Army post massacre, a horrific rampage that has Army leaders openly worrying about discrimination against Muslims in their ranks. It was Nov 9, 1989, when the wall fell -- and with it the global power structure that had defined the Cold War era. Reflecting on the moment Sunday, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said the chain of events that led to the wall's collapse began with his decision to hold competitive elections and to tell leaders of the Soviet client states they should take charge of their own territories. "It was the creation of a new state," Gorbachev told "State of the Union" from Berlin, Germany. "In effect, pluralism, economic, political pluralism, all of that was testimony that our country was moving along the path of democracy." Video: The Army's home front strain

Video: Pollsters on health care, 2010
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading the U.S. delegation to the Berlin commemoration; Newt Gingrich is among the conservative voices making the case it is a mistake for President Obama not to attend. The president's week includes a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, and he travels to Texas on Tuesday to attend the memorial service at Fort Hood, Texas. Obama then heads overseas for the annual Asian Pacific economic summit, with stops planned in Japan, China and Singapore. There's no floor debate on health care this week, but it's still an important time as the Senate decides what is good and not so good from its perspective. One thing to watch for: possible new numbers on what the Congressional Budget Office thinks of Sen. Harry Reid's proposed health care compromise. Some other events of note: • John Allen Muhammad is scheduled to be executed Tuesday. He was convicted of shooting multiple people during a sniper shooting spree in the Washington, D.C., area in 2002. • Earnings reports from Tyco, Wal-Mart, Walt Disney and Nordstrom. • Wednesday is Veterans Day Enjoy the week

Few customers lining up for Verizon's iPhone By John D. Sutter and Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Mobile Customers wait in line Thursday to buy the new Verizon iPhone in Coral Gables, Florida. STORY HIGHLIGHTSRelatively few stand in line to buy Verizon Wireless iPhone 4, anecdotal reports sayApple stores, Verizon stores and Best Buy are selling the new phonesSince 2007, iPhone users have dreamed of having more than one carrier (CNN) -- After years of anticipation, relatively few people waited in line Thursday morning to buy the new Verizon Wireless iPhone 4, according to anecdotal reports. Fifteen minutes before the phone went on sale, eight people were in line at Apple's flagship store in New York, according to CNNMoney. Down the street, about a dozen people waited in line at a Verizon Wireless store. And in Atlanta, Georgia, slightly more than a dozen stood in line outside a Verizon store to get the new phone. One of them, Lena Hill, 22, brought food and blankets at 6:15 a.m., expecting to have to camp out in a line to get the device. There wasn't a line, so Hill just waited in her car. "It's an iPhone. There's so much hype about it," she said. "You just have to get it." In San Francisco, there were no shoppers lined up early Thursday at an Apple store downtown, and only a small line at a nearby Verizon store. By contrast, thousands have lined up for the release of previous Apple products, including the initial launch of the iPhone 4 in June. In the past, many shoppers have even slept outside all night to ensure being among the first to get a new Apple gadget. Explain it to me: iPhone's new home

Verizon Communications Inc.
Apple iPhone
The Verizon iPhone's hardware is similar to the existing iPhone -- the big difference being that it works on Verizon's network instead of AT&T, which has had exclusive rights as the iPhone's wireless carrier since 2007. The new iPhone went on sale at 7 a.m. Thursday at Verizon and Apple stores, at Best Buy and on the retailer's websites. With a two-year contract, it retails for $199 for the 16GB model and $299 for the 32GB model. iReport: Are you getting a Verizon iPhone? Customers were able to pre-order the Verizon iPhone last week, and analysts estimate between 250,000 and 1 million of the phones were sold on pre-order, making it among the biggest phone debuts on the Verizon network. Pre-orders for the phone sold out within a day, according to Mashable. The phone became available again available for internet purchase Wednesday. Customers have been calling for Apple to offer the iPhone on networks other than AT&T for years, in part because that network is known for dropped calls. Consumer Reports surveys consistently rank AT&T below competitors in terms of customer satisfaction. Larger cities, such as New York and San Francisco, have experienced particular problems with dropped calls and a lack of mobile broadband service on AT&T, to a certain degree because so many data-heavy iPhone users contributed to jamming the network. Alex Ricker, a 28-year-old who bought a Verizon iPhone in Atlanta, said she waited on an upgrade for eight months to get the iPhone on Verizon and never would have considered switching to AT&T to get the phone. "I looked at all the other smartphones and they just -- they were really bulky and quite expensive, and I felt like waiting," she said. Bob Nadolski, 45, said his daughter begged him to switch his family's cell phone plan from Verizon to AT&T so she could get an iPhone. "I personally have not had great voice service through AT&T" on a work account, he said. "Where we live, Verizon has better coverage, so I would never switch the family plan to AT&T." Nadolski bought his daughter the Verizon iPhone on Thursday and said she had been waiting "very patiently" for the phone. Switching carriers to get an iPhone isn't easy. First, owners of a current iPhone can't simply switch from AT&T to Verizon. They'll need to buy a new phone. And that's on top of early-termination fees of up to $325 they'll have to pay to break their current contract. Some were still willing to make the leap. Lauren Asther, 19, told CNNMoney she was switching to Verizon for the iPhone. "I have the AT&T phone, and it kept dropping calls," she said. The cold weather may have contributed to smaller-than-usual lines. "Apple clearly was expecting more of a crowd this morning," CNET wrote on a live blog from New York. "As I mentioned earlier, the Apple staff way out-numbered actual Verizon iPhone 4 customers. I guess we finally have the answer to the question: What will keep people from standing in line for a new iPhone on launch day? It looks like 20-degree temperatures."

Former dictators found guilty in Argentine baby-stealing trial
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 11:56 AM EDT, Tue July 10, 2012
Former Argentine general and last dictator Reynaldo Bignone, left, and former Argentine general and dictator Jorge Rafael Videla attend the beginning of their trial on February 28, 2011. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The crimes were "the most perverse of the dictatorship," one victim says
Court: Jorge Rafael Videla and Reynaldo Benito Bignone are guilty of baby thefts
They were found guilty of stealing babies from political prisoners
They were both one-time dictators of Argentina
Buenos Aires (CNN) -- An Argentinian court Thursday found two former dictators guilty of stealing dozens of babies during the country's dirty war.
Jorge Rafael Videla, who ruled as a dictator between 1976 to 1981, was sentenced to 50 years in prison.
Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone, who ruled the country from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
They were the two most high-profile defendants found guilty Thursday of systematically stealing babies from political prisoners and giving them new identities.

"It was the worst, the most perverse of the dictatorship, I think, what they did with us," said Francisco Madariaga Quintela, 35, one of the stolen babies who was reunited with his father in 2010. "It was a torture prolonged through time, for the grandmothers searching, for family members, everyone."
Observers packed the courtroom Thursday and cheered when a judge read the verdict for Videla.
Afterward, outside the courthouse, family members of the disappeared told CNN affiliate Canal 7 that they were satisfied with the verdict.
"It was what we were asking for. We never asked for revenge. We never hated. We never asked for anything more than justice, and we have been fighting for 36 years," one father said.
The dictators and their officers were on trial for being the "presumed authors of the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities," according to a statement from the country's judiciary. Specifically, they were tried for the stealing of 34 babies from their parents, the court said.
During the trial, Videla said children may have been kidnapped, but he said that there was no order or systematic plan.
Videla, who was among the coup leaders who overthrew then-President Isabel Martinez de Peron in March 1976, was previously convicted in 2010 of human rights abuses during his rule and is currently serving a life sentence in prison.
Former dictator sentenced to life
Bignone was sentenced in 2009 to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people.
The accusations stem from the country's "Dirty War" from 1976 to 1983. During those years of military dictatorship, up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers.
Mariana Zaffaroni Islas, who was reunited with her family in 1993, told Argentina's state-run Telam news agency that the verdict was significant for all Argentinians.
"For any citizen who lives in a country where actions like this do not remain unpunished with the passage of time, it represents a guarantee that justice is done," she said.
CNN's Guillermo Fontana contributed to this report.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the man was detained while trying to cross the border from Colombia into Venezuela.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
President Hugo Chavez says authorities are continuing to investigate the matter
Detainee has not been identified
Chavez has said the man had "all the appearances of a mercenary"
Washington (CNN) -- The United States will have no problem getting access to an American detainee who is being held in Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez said Tuesday.
"Foreign Minister Maduro has informed me of the U.S. government's request through its embassy to have access to the detainee. Of course, we approve it. They request it today, and tomorrow they will have contact with the detainee," Chavez said on Venezuela's state-run VTV.
Chavez's statement may be news to some State Department officials, who have complained about not being allowed to communicate with the detainee.
"The Venezuelans did confirm to us here in Washington yesterday ... that they do have an American citizen under custody," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday.
"They did not follow usual channels and notify our embassy in capital, nor have they responded to our request for consular access to him," she said.
Chavez has accused the detainee of having "all the appearances of a mercenary."
The man has not been identified.
Venezuela notifies U.S. officials of American's arrest
Chavez, who is running for re-election, first announced the arrest last week. The man was detained while trying to cross the border from Colombia into Venezuela, the president said.
Late Tuesday, Chavez reported that authorities were continuing to investigate the matter and had reached out to the Colombian government.
The detainee told authorities he was a former Marine, but otherwise refused to provide information, according to Chavez, who has described the man's behavior as "suspicious."
Chavez said the passport the man was carrying had stamps from recent years from Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. The president also said police seized a notebook with written coordinates.
"It sends a powerful signal, how this citizen wanted to illegally enter the country, to do who knows what. ... He says he was fleeing from I don't know who. The certainty is that this forces us to activate many more alarms everywhere," Chavez said last week.
The Venezuelan president has repeatedly accused U.S. officials and members of Venezuela's opposition of plotting to destabilize the country's government.

Republicans increase pressure on Obama over Rice
By Laurie Ure, CNN Congressional Producer updated 6:43 PM EST, Tue November 20, 2012
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice may be nominated to be the next secretary of state.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
97 House Republicans sign letter questioning ambassador's credibility
Critics say Rice made misleading remarks after attack on embassy in Libya
Administration says Rice was only repeating talking points cleared by intel community
(CNN) -- Republicans this week increased pressure on President Barack Obama to drop any thought of nominating U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice as secretary of state.
In a letter to Obama, 97 House Republicans questioned Rice's credibility "at home and around the world" after her "misleading" public statements about the origin of the deadly September attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.
Written and circulated by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-South Carolina), Monday's letter was the latest in a barrage of Republican criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi situation before and after the attack.
Critics have aggressively focused on Rice's comments on television talk shows five days after the armed assault. Rice said a small number of people came to the mission in a spontaneous reaction to demonstrations occurring in Egypt over the anti-Muslim film, but the Benghazi protest was hijacked by armed extremists.
Petraeus links Benghazi attack to al Qaeda
Senior administration officials later said Rice was speaking from talking points prepared for official use, and said the word "spontaneous" was a poor choice to describe what is now understood to have been a terrorist attack. Killed in the assault were Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Rice never mentioned terrorists.
Intel community alter talking points

Benghazi talking points vs. truth
"Ambassador Rice propagated a falsehood that the attacks were 'spontaneous,'" the congressional letter said, and she "is widely viewed as having either willfully or incompetently misled the American public in the Benghazi matter."
The letter said Rice's actions "plausibly give" U.S. allies and rivals a reason to question American commitment and credibility.
"Thus, we believe that making her the face of U.S. foreign policy in your second term would greatly undermine your desire to improve U.S. relations with the world and continue to build trust with the American people," the letter said.
Rice is thought to be on the president's short list of nominees to succeed Hillary Clinton as America's top diplomat. Clinton said she plans to leave after Obama is sworn in for a second term in January and her successor is in place.
On Monday, the spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community was responsible for substantive changes made to the talking points distributed for government officials to use to talk publicly about the attack.
Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told reporters after a hearing last week that original unclassified talking points were "much more specific about al Qaeda involvement" with the final draft just saying there were "indications of extremists."
The Republican-led House Intelligence Committee said it wanted to "discuss this new explanation" with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, as soon as possible.
Some Republican members of Congress have suggested the changes came from within the Obama administration -- from the White House, the Justice Department or another government agency.
Ansar al Sharia explained
Sen. John McCain, a harsh critic of the administration on Benghazi and of Rice's comments about it, said in a statement on Tuesday about changes to the talking points that questions remain unanswered.
"But this latest episode is another reason why many of us are so frustrated with, and suspicious of, the actions of this administration when it comes to the Benghazi attack," McCain said.
Obama called out McCain and fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham last week for their "outrageous" comments that they would block any nomination of Rice for secretary of state.
"If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after someone, they should go after me," Obama said at a news conference.
Nominations to top government positions require Senate confirmation.

Boeing can conduct Dreamliner test flights
By Mike M. Ahlers, CNN
updated 5:34 AM EST, Fri February 8, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
FAA authorizes Dreamliner test flights as part of effort to address electrical problem
Boeing "confident" flight tests can be performed safely
Safety board investigators intensify scrutiny of tests that led to battery approval
Dreamliners grounded in January; plane is big bet for world's largest plane manufacturer
Washington (CNN) -- After three weeks on the ground, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner soon will return to the skies -- but only so engineers can test the plane's troubled electrical and battery systems, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
The FAA approved test flights for the Boeing planes with strict conditions to assure safety: Only essential personnel will be on board, crews must continuously monitor the plane for battery-related problems and tests will be conducted over unpopulated areas.
"These flights will be an important part of our efforts to ensure the safety of passengers and return these aircraft to service," the agency said.
Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said in a statement that the company is "confident" the tests could be conducted safely, and said one Boeing aircraft has been designated for the test. Flights are planned in the U.S. Northwest.
Although there are only 50 Dreamliners in service worldwide, the stakes are high for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. Following a difficult development, Boeing has several hundred 787s on order at roughly $200 million apiece.
When will the Dreamliner fly again?
NTSB offers look at Boeing plane battery
Dreamliner, A380: Headaches?
A pilot's view on Dreamliner's woes
The Dreamliner is the first commercial aircraft to have extensive use of novel lithium-ion batteries, which can hold more electrical power in a smaller, lighter space.
Dreamliner battery type requires safeguards, safety advocate says
The FAA announcement comes on the same day the National Transportation Safety Board told reporters it had identified the exact battery cell that first short-circuited on a plane in Boston in early January, but still had not determined the root cause of the electrical short.
It listed among the possibilities a manufacturing flaw, a design defect or problems with external systems that charge and discharge the battery.
The safety board also said it is placing under the microscope Boeing's testing program, which led to the certification of the lithium-ion batteries for the plane.
Those tests apparently led the airplane builder to greatly underestimate the chances of battery failure, the safety board said.
Boeing had estimated a "smoke" event would occur "less than once in 10 million flight hours" with the batteries, Deborah Hersman, the safety board's chairman, said.
But two batteries failed after fewer than 100,000 hours of actual flight, one leading to a fire aboard the 787 on the ground in Boston.
Further, Boeing's indications that heat damage in one battery cell would not harm adjacent cells proved false, Hersman said.
"The assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered," Hersman said.
Hersman's statements cast doubt on the safety of the battery technology and the FAA's certification process for approving technology.
It also appeared to dispel any hopes for a quick resolution to the problem, which has led to the grounding of the Dreamliner fleet globally since Jan. 16.
The safety board plans to release an interim report of its findings within 30 days.
Japan's ANA replaced faulty batteries on Dreamliner last year
The FAA -- the ultimate arbiter of when the plane can resume flying -- has declined to predict when the 787 will return to commercial service.
Speaking about the January 7 fire in Boston, Hersman said the plane's flight data recorder showed the battery underwent an unexplained drop in voltage from 32 volts to 28 immediately before the incident, as the plane was being serviced on the tarmac. The voltage drop was consistent with the charge of a single cell on the eight-cell battery, she said.
Hersman said investigators believe the problem originated in cell six, which shows multiple signs of a short circuit -- an unintended path of electricity. The short circuit resulted in a thermal runaway -- a chemical chain reaction -- in cell six, which spread to adjacent cells.
"Charred battery components indicated that the temperature inside the battery case exceeded 500 degrees," Hersman said.
But investigators still don't know what caused cell six to short-circuit in the first place.
They have ruled out two possibilities -- mechanical "impact" damage, like that caused by being dropped, or short-circuiting outside the battery.
But several other possibilities are being explored, including contamination or defect during manufacturing, flaws in the design or construction of the battery, and problems with battery charging. That final possibility -- battery charging -- leaves open the possibility that the problem could reside outside the battery itself.
When the FAA approved the use of the lithium-ion batteries on the Dreamliner, it imposed nine "special conditions" that were designed to prevent or mitigate problems.
In a joint statement on Thursday, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta reiterated that they are determined to fix the problem.
"Based on what information our experts find, the FAA will take any action necessary to further ensure safety. We must finish this work before reaching conclusions about what changes or improvements the FAA should make going forward," the statement read.
"The FAA is focused on the review and activities to understand the root cause. Once the review is complete, the FAA will make any analysis and conclusions public."
Boeing said it has hundreds of experts focused on solving the battery situation. "We are working this issue tirelessly in cooperation with our customers and the appropriate regulatory and investigative authorities."
What's wrong with the Dreamliner?

(CNN) -- Federal authorities were at the apartment of deceased bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev on Sunday, executing a search warrant, an FBI spokeswoman said.
Amanda Cox said, "There is court-authorized law enforcement activity" at the home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that Tsarnaev shared with his wife and young daughter.
Workers in white hazmat suits were at the apartment, CNN affiliate WCVB reported.
Cox said the search stopped for the day in the early afternoon. It was not immediately clear whether workers had taken anything from the home.
On Friday, a source briefed on the investigation said investigators found explosives residue in the small apartment.
It has turned up in at least three places, the source said: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, identified as Suspect 2, was captured in a Boston suburb on April 19 after a manhunt that shut down the city.
From left, Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev went with Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to Times Square in this photo taken from the social media site VK.com. A federal grand jury charged Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice on Thursday, August 8. Both had been arrested and charged in May, but only with the conspiracy count. See all photography related to the Boston bombings.
Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was also arrested on May 1. He was charged with lying to federal agents about the bombing, according to court papers.
Phillipos, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the April 15 bombings. The items they took included a backpack containing fireworks that had been "opened and emptied of powder," according to the affidavit.

The FBI released photos and video on April 18 of two men identified as Suspect 1 and Suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. They were later identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26.
Police say the dead suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is the man the FBI identified as Suspect 1. He was killed during the shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts, early April 19. He is pictured here at the 2010 New England Golden Gloves.
Boston Police released surveillance images of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at a convenience store on April 19.
The FBI tweeted this photo on April 19 and urged Watertown residents to stay indoors as they searched for the second suspect.
The FBI released photos and video on April 18 of two men it called suspects in the deadly bombings and pleaded for public help in identifying them. The men were photographed walking together near the finish line.
A man identified as Suspect 2 appeared in this photograph by bystander David Green, who took the photo after completing the Boston Marathon. Green submitted the photo to the FBI, he told Piers Morgan in an interview.

Photos: Suspects tied to Boston bombings
Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has said they built the bombs there, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said.
Where will Tamerlan Tsarnaev be buried?
Boston bomb survivor: I am blessed
First security change after Boston
On Sunday, Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body remained at a funeral home, where his uncle said he was trying to deal with the logistics of readying the body for burial.
"I'm here to prepare his body, to wash it, shroud it, to prepare his body," Ruslan Tsarni said.
Tsarni said he was the only family member at the funeral home and had not had contact with Katherine Russell, Tamerlan's widow.
The funeral home owner, Peter Stefan, said he still has yet to find a cemetery willing to accept the body for burial.
A day earlier, he had said that if no gravesite is found, he plans to ask the government to find a grave.
Three cemeteries that Stefan contacted said they feared reprisals, but the funeral home owner said you can't pick and choose when it comes to a burial.
"This is what we do in a civilized society, regardless of the circumstances," Stefan said. "As I told some of them, at the immediate moment, you may fear (reprisal), but later on, when things calm down, people are going to resent you because you didn't do it."
Tsarnaev's death certificate has yet to be filed with the Boston city clerk, and there is no burial plot, according to the funeral home.
The city manager of Cambridge said Sunday he would not allow Tsarnaev to be buried in the city if requested by the funeral director or Tsarnaev's family.
"The difficult and stressful efforts of the citizens of the City of Cambridge to return to a peaceful life would be adversely impacted by the turmoil, protests, and widespread media presence at such an interment," City Manager Robert W. Healy said in a statement.
Tsarnaev died April 19 after he and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, shot a university police officer to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them, according to authorities.
A few days earlier -- April 15 -- he and his younger brother allegedly bombed the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding more than 260.

Gallery: Watertown shootout
Source: Suspects targeted July 4th event Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body claimed
Brain development's role in Boston attack
CNN obtained a copy of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's death certificate, which lists the cause of death as "gunshot wounds of torso and extremities" and "blunt trauma to head and torso."
The document notes that Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over and dragged by a car. It lists the manner of death as homicide and notes that he was "DOA," or dead on arrival.
Authorities have said his younger brother may have run him over as they resisted arrest days after the marathon attacks.
Separately, 12 people remained hospitalized with bombing-related injuries on Saturday, according to a count by CNN. None was in serious condition.
Also, the frantic manhunt more than two weeks ago for the surviving bombing suspect drew the attention of gun rights advocates at their convention in Houston.
National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said residents were "imprisoned" in their homes with no means to protect themselves while police searched for the younger Tsarnaev.
"How many Bostonians wished they had a gun two weeks ago?" he asked.
"Boston proves it. When brave law enforcement officers did their job in that city so courageously, good guys with guns stopped terrorists with guns," he said.
'Everyone deserves to be buried' Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body remained unclaimed until Thursday, when Tsarni, who had previously publicly condemned his alleged attacks, had a funeral parlor pick up the body.
Tsarni had decried the bomb suspects as "losers" after the attacks.
Their parents in Dagestan have said they will not fly his body back to Russia for burial, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said.
WCVB reported that the hearse that picked up Tsarnaev's body ferried it to a funeral home 30 miles from Boston, near the Rhode Island state line.
Residents of North Attleboro, Massachusetts, took to the streets to boo Tsarnaev when they heard about the presence of the corpse in their town, The Sun Chronicle reported.
Others took to social media to vent anger at the funeral home for accepting the body. It was later transported to Stefan's funeral home, Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester.
"Everyone deserves to be buried," Stefan said.
The marathon bombings
Authorities say the brothers carried out the Boston Marathon bombings using explosive devices made with pressure cookers.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts, charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries the death penalty.
He is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother's death.
Other target, possible cover-up
The marathon was not the original target, the law enforcement officials said. The brothers had set their sights on a suicide attack on the city's massive Independence Day celebration, which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally.
But the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated, and a day or two before the Boston Marathon, they changed their plans, the officials said.
They spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.
One key question involves whether intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security agencies could have done more in their investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in recent years before the attack and whether they shared information effectively enough. An independent government review is under way.
In an interview with Univision published on its website on Saturday, President Barack Obama said that cooperation among agencies can always get better. But he again defended U.S. efforts.
"I think we can continue to improve and refine how we're engaging and countering terrorist activity," Obama said. "I don't think it's fair to say though that law enforcement dropped the ball."
It is very difficult to prevent attacks when dealing with individuals who are self-radicalized and not part of a massive conspiracy or network, he said about the current belief of investigators looking at the origins of the Boston bombing.
Tamerlan's widow; Dzhokhar's friends
Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow, Russell, has remained largely out of view since her husband's death, staying in her parents' Rhode Island home.
Her attorney, Amato DeLuca, says the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an "absolute shock" to Russell and her family.
Three of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends have been accused of covering for the bombing suspects.
Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both from Kazakhstan, were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was charged with making false statements to investigators.
All three are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. According to FBI affidavits released this week, they left with the backpack and Vaseline -- which Tazhayakov believed could be used to make bombs -- and Tsarnaev's laptop.
Investigators found the backpack, fireworks and Vaseline in a landfill last week after a two-day search.
The laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19, the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev's attorney Robert Stahl said.
The FBI is examining the laptop, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN.
Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas.

Roller coaster ride became 'nightmare' for Texas woman's family
By Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN
updated 3:15 PM EDT, Mon July 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Six Flags Over Texas says it's committed to finding out what caused a woman's death
In Facebook posts, Rosy Esparza's family calls the experience a "nightmare"
Authorities say there is no sign of "foul play or criminality"
Witnesses tell CNN affiliates that the woman didn't feel safe before the ride
(CNN) -- It was Rosy Esparza's first trip to Six Flags.
She sat on the Texas Giant, a 14-story-high roller coaster that boasts what the amusement park calls "the world's steepest drop."
Minutes later, one of the roller coaster's seats came back empty.
Now Esparza is dead and Six Flags Over Texas representatives say the theme park is committed to finding out what led to the woman's death on Friday.
Esparza's son-in-law and his wife were sitting in front of her at the time. Contrary to witness accounts reported by CNN affiliates, Ronald Segovia told CNN he did not hear his mother-in-law mention that her seat did not lock properly.
Who was victim killed on roller coaster?
Witnesses: Woman fell off roller coaster
Witness: Son was screaming 'Mom fell off'
Safety concerns after Six Flags death
Segovia also told CNN that Esparza was sitting by herself, contrary to initial reports that she was sitting beside her son. Her sons, according to Segovia, were not there.
In Facebook posts on Saturday, her sons described the experience as a nightmare.
A flood of condolences and prayers poured in.
"Only God knows Mama," Amado Esparza posted in Spanish along with a photo showing a group of people praying at the amusement park, "something that I will always have as a memory of you is that you loved adventures."
Later, he described his mother as his best friend.
"It is sad to lose my mom," he wrote, "but I am happy that when she was alive she enjoyed it to the fullest. I always took her to explore new places."
On Saturday, authorities said an initial investigation showed no sign of foul play in the woman's death.
"At this point of the investigation, it does not appear there was any foul play or criminality associated with this tragic incident," the Arlington Police Department said in a statement.
Park visitors told CNN affiliate WFAA they saw the woman fall.
"She goes up like this," Carmen Brown told the affiliate, raising her hand up in the air. "Then when it drops to come down, that's when it released, and she just tumbled."
Brown told The Dallas Morning News that the woman had expressed concern to a park employee that she was not properly secured in her seat.
"He was basically nonchalant," Brown said. "He was, like, 'As long as you heard it click, you're fine.' Hers was the only one that went down once, and she didn't feel safe. But they let her still get on the ride."
Six Flags confirmed that a woman died Friday while riding the Texas Giant roller coaster, but did not provide further details.
"Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation," the theme park said in a statement.
Six Flags Over Texas spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the park is committed to determining exactly what happened.
"It would be a disservice to the family to speculate regarding what transpired," she said. "When we have new information to provide, we will do so."
The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all-wooden roller coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary.
At its highest point, the roller coaster is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park.
Thousands of kids hurt yearly on amusement rides
Authorities look at a number of factors when they investigate theme park accidents, said Bill Avery, an amusement ride and device safety consultant.
"You're going to look at the operations of it, and the human factor, the human part of the equation," he told CNN. "Was there an error or omission made by an operator or someone in operations?"
Maintenance and design would also be examined, he said, in addition to details such as the rider's posture and size.
Avery, who founded a ride safety consulting firm and once headed up safety at several parks, said there a few things visitors should keep in mind when it comes to securing safety restraints.
"As a general rule," he said, "It needs to fit snugly near your waistline, above the top of your thighs, so it can hold the passenger in regardless of what kind of forces are applied, and where they're applied, on the human body."
The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, a trade group representing amusement parks, describes them as "one of the safest forms of recreation available to the public."
"Approximately 297 million guests visit the 400 U.S. amusement parks annually and take 1.7 billion safe rides," the association says on its website.
Visitors of fixed-site amusement parks -- places where rides are permanently attached to the ground -- have a 1 in 24 million chance of being seriously injured, the association said.
