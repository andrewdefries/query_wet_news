LONDON, England (CNN) -- British anti-terror police say they have seized a large amount of explosive materials and arrested eight men in a series of raids.Police sources told CNN on Tuesday the suspects seized in the early-morning raids were "linked to possible Islamist terror." Peter Clarke, head of London's Metropolitan police anti-terror branch, said the arrests were unrelated to Irish republican terrorism or the Madrid train bombs that killed 190 people this month. But Spanish Interior Minister Angel Acebes told reporters in Madrid that one of the suspects may have a link. Police are investigating, he said. In an unusual public statement, Clarke said half a ton of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, used in the manufacture of explosives, was recovered in west London. All the suspects were British citizens aged between 17 and 32, Clarke said, and were arrested "on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism."The men can be held for up to 14 days without charge under Britain's updated terrorism laws.Clarke gave a hint as to which direction the case may be headed. "As we have said on many occasions in the past, we in the police service know that the overwhelming majority of the Muslim community are law abiding and completely reject all forms of violence. We have a responsibility to all communities to investigate suspected terrorist activity," he said.Seven hundred officers carried out 24 raids under the Terrorism Act 2000 across London and southern England, he said, adding that there was no risk to the public. Ammonium nitrate is a common agricultural fertilizer, but can be mixed with fuel oil to make a powerful explosive. It was used in the October 12, 2002 blast in Bali that killed 202 people, mostly Western tourists, and the Oklahoma City bomb in 1995 that killed 168 people. About 2.5 tons of the substance was used in the Oklahoma City bomb. Clarke said part of the investigation would focus on the "purchase, storage and intended use of that material." Police displayed a large, white plastic bag with strips of yellow tape similar to the one containing the ammonium nitrate and asked for the public's help in determining where the chemical came from. UK attack 'inevitable'London has been on guard against a potential terrorist attack since the March 11 bombing of four commuter trains in Madrid that killed 190 people. Britain's most senior police officer Sir John Stevens has said officers are investigating a "definitive link" between the Madrid bombers and al Qaeda supporters based in Britain.He also said an attack on Britain was "inevitable" following Madrid.Earlier this month police in London launched a new drive to try to thwart potential terrorist attacks in the capital.Scotland Yard and the City of London police jointly launched a public awareness and poster campaign.The move came as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met European counterparts in Brussels to discuss anti-terrorist measures, and security experts from the five largest European nations conferred in Madrid.

Taliban claims victory near IslamabadStory Highlights Heavily armed men openly patrolled roads in pickup trucks Last week, Taliban imposed sharia law in Swat Valley as part of government deal Taliban's return indicates government concessions may have emboldened militants Pro-Taliban clerics stage rallies in Swat, Islamabad since sharia decision Next Article in World » Read VIDEO MAP By Ivan Watson CNN	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants who implemented Islamic law in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley last week have now taken control of a neighboring district. Pakistani paramilitary troops patrol a street in Islamabad on Tuesday. Control of the Buner district brings the Taliban closer to the capital, Islamabad, than they have been since they started their insurgency. Islamabad is 96 kilometers (60 miles) from the district. "Our strength is in the hundreds," said Moulana Mohammad Khalil, as heavily armed men openly patrolled the roads in pickup trucks, singing Islamic anthems. The militants had taken control of the area to ensure that Islamic law, or sharia, is properly imposed, Khalil said. The government called the advance into Buner a breach of a recently-signed peace agreement. Watch as Taliban is emboldened » "Now Taliban are violating the peace agreement, and if they continue the government will take strict action and not allow the Taliban to create a parallel government in that area," said Mian Iftikhar, a spokesman for the regional administration in the North West Frontier Province, where Buner is located. Last week, the Taliban imposed sharia law in Swat Valley as part of a peace deal with the government. Under the Taliban's strict interpretation, the law prevents women from being seen in public without their husbands or fathers. Earlier this month, the militant movement made forays into Buner and clashed with locals before withdrawing. Now the Taliban appear to have returned in force -- a move that indicates the recent government concessions may have emboldened the militants to expand their reach. The Pakistani government appears unable or unwilling to stop the Taliban's steady advance deeper into the territory of this nuclear-armed country. In the days after the government's April 13 decision to implement sharia law in Swat, pro-Taliban clerics have staged rallies in Swat and Islamabad. They have demanded the imposition of Islamic law across Pakistan and beyond. Speaking before an audience of tens of thousands in the Swat Valley town of Mingora on Sunday, cleric Sufi Muhammed declared democracy and Pakistan's judicial system "un-Islamic." A Taliban spokesman in Swat went a step further Tuesday, calling anyone opposed to his strict interpretation of Islam a non-Muslim. IReport:Should the U.S. interfere in Pakistan? "Let the judges and the lawyers go to Islamic university," Muslim Khan said. After "they learn Islamic rules, Islamic regulation, they can continue to work."

The rise of the Taliban in Swat has alarmed and frightened some members of local civil society there. "This is a time bomb for the country," said Aftab Alam, the head of the lawyers' association in Swat district. Meanwhile, in another Taliban-run region called Orakzai, details emerged of militants forcing a small community of Sikhs to pay a jaziya, or "minority tax," of 10.5 million rupees (roughly $130,000) earlier this month. Khan said if his vision of an Islamic society is fulfilled in Pakistan, terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden will be welcome to travel and live openly here. "Sure, he's a Muslim, he can go anywhere," Khan said. Khan added that he would like to see sharia law implemented beyond Pakistan, even in America, a country he knows intimately. For four years, the Taliban spokesman lived in the United States, working as a painter near Boston, Massachusetts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Wednesday that Pakistan is in danger of falling into terrorist hands because of failed government policies. "I think that we cannot underscore the seriousness of the existential threat posed to the state of Pakistan by continuing advances, now within hours of Islamabad, that are being made by a loosely confederated group of terrorists and others who are seeking the overthrow of the Pakistani state, a nuclear armed state," Clinton said in Washington. She added the international community is working closely to combat extremism in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, but Pakistanis themselves need to take responsibility. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

1 swine flu case leads to 340 quarantines in Hong Kong Story Highlights More than 340 people quarantined in Hong Kong following single case of H1N1 Those isolated due to remain in quarantine until Friday Confined persons include 36 travelers in three-row vicinity of sick man aboard flightNext Article in World » Read VIDEO By Elizabeth Yuan CNN	HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In Hong Kong, where the alert level has been raised to "emergency" after reporting its first case of swine flu, authorities are trying to keep the H1N1 virus from spreading through the metropolis of 7 million people through quarantine, stepped-up border measures and surveillance. Quarantined guests and hotel employees wave through the glass of the main entrance of Hong Kong's Metro Park Hotel. The quarantine has extended beyond the single confirmed case, a 25-year-old Mexican man, to include more than 340 people. They include: two taxi drivers, two fellow taxi passengers, a local friend, 36 passengers within a three-row vicinity of the patient aboard a China Eastern flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel he checked into. All have been put on the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Among the two cab drivers, one was suspected of taking the patient from the airport to the hotel, and another was believed to have taken him from the hotel to the hospital. Authorities are seeing another 40 to 50 guests whose names are on the hotel's guest list. Some of them left their luggage behind. "They are gambling with their health, jeopardizing public health safety," said Dr. York Chow, secretary for Food and Health, appealing to the guests to come forward. Don't Miss U.N. wary of second wave of swine flu
Hysteria over swine flu is the real danger, some say
In addition to the Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district, the Lady Maclehose Holiday Village is being used as an isolation center during the one-week quarantines. The government has assured that people under quarantine will have their visas automatically extended, their hotel lodging fees waived and their onward journeys prepared. The Wanchai hotel is providing guests $200 worth of free overseas telephone calls daily. The isolation order, which went into effect Friday night, is to expire Friday at 8:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) -- the length of an incubation period for swine flu. The isolation order did not extend to the air crew or remaining passengers aboard the China Eastern flight. An airplane's air exchange rate is high compared to that in an office or hotel, explained Yuen Kwok-yung, chair of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong. "Risk is very low on a plane," he said. So far, there have been no further confirmed cases of swine flu, and no Hong Kong pigs have tested positive for the virus, Yuen said.

NATO may go for enforcement of 'no-fly plus' By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSAll 28 NATO allies authorized a plan that includes civilian protectionTransition to be complete by Sunday night, sources sayQuestions on rules of engagement remain to be worked out Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO members agreed Thursday to take over enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya, but stopped short of interpreting that mandate as a license to attack government troops who may be threatening unarmed civilians. "What we have decided today is that NATO will enforce the no-fly zone," NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer from the organization's headquarters in Brussels. Under Thursday's agreement, NATO forces will be able to close air space to all flights except for humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense. NATO also has sent a directive to its military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1973, according to NATO sources. Under what some officials were calling "no-fly plus," NATO would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected, the sources said. And, in an effort to ease concerns from Turkey -- the organization's sole Muslim country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions, such as those involving attacking Libyan soldiers, the sources said. Libyan govt. media trip goes wrong
Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage
What does Libya's military have left?
Should coalition support Libyan rebels?
As for the prospect of a more robust mandate, one that the U.S.-led coalition has followed so far, "That decision has not been made yet," Rasmussen said. He added that NATO will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue. "It's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a NATO operation," he said. "It is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in Libya." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who will travel to London to attend an international meeting on Libya on Tuesday, gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days. "We have made significant progress," she told reporters. "A massacre in Benghazi was prevented. Gadhafi's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective, and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya." She welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from Qatar and Thursday's announcement by the United Arab Emirates that it, too, would send planes to protect Libya's civilians. "In the days ahead, as NATO assumes command-and-control responsibilities, the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern," she said. "This operation has already saved many lives, but the danger is far from over." Rasmussen said the issue did not represent a split in NATO over the mission. However, he also acknowledged that, if unaltered, the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts, with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and the U.S.-led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes. Thursday's deal was reached after a conference call among Clinton and her counterparts from Britain, France and Turkey, according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name. So far, U.S. forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission, according to figures provided by the Pentagon. Of the 175 Tomahawk missiles fired, 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain, the only two countries to possess them, while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved. The flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of Libya was continuing to unfold. After a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets, Libyans gathered at a seaside cemetery in Tripoli on Thursday for the funerals of 33 people Gadhafi's government said were victims of an airstrike. State television said the dead were victims of the "crusader colonial aggression." Earlier, a Libyan government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of Tajura and state TV showed images of fires, smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead. At the cemetery, anger trumped grief and Gadhafi's message was loud and clear: innocent people were wrongly killed and the Libyan people will fight back. CNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were. In Tripoli, CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli.

The reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces, which launched airstrikes Thursday near Tripoli, Misrata and Ajdabiya in Libya. "The only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused," U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of a cease-fire by Libyan government authorities, as called for by U.N. Resolution 1973, which was hurriedly passed last Thursday as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Ban told council members, "to the contrary, fierce battles continue in and around the cities of" Ajdabiya, Misrata and Zinan. He added that his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution, "the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures." Ban said he had sent his envoy to an African Union meeting to be held Friday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at which representatives of the Gadhafi government and the opposition were expected to attend. "Their aim: to reach a cease-fire and political solution." But there was no sign that any such solution was near. The battle for Misrata, Libya's third-largest city, has been ongoing for more than a week. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water. In the east, Gadhafi's tanks were shelling Ajdabiya, where fighting had occurred the day before. Loyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city. "This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action, as do continued threats by Gadhafi forces to 'massacre' residents in areas under bombardment," Hague said. The coalition has established a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya's coast. French jets fired air-to-ground missiles on a Libyan combat aircraft Thursday that was in violation of the no-fly mandate, destroying it, the French Defense Ministry said. The plane was struck as it was landing in a Misrata airfield. The civil war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians, prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend. Though the rebels' position may have improved since then, a U.S. official said Gadhafi's forces still have the upper hand. They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition, are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively, the official said.CNN's Nic Robertson, Arwa Damon, Elise Labott, Paula Newton and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.

iPad Mini review: More than just a smaller face
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 11:25 AM EST, Tue November 6, 2012 | Filed under: Mobile
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The iPad Mini hits the spot with its perfectly portable size, but the price tag is high
Buyers could be disappointed by the lack of a retina display on the Mini
iPad Mini is great for consuming content, but 10-inch iPad is still best as a PC replacement
(CNN) -- Apple's latest tablet comes in a smaller, pocketable, gripable, adorable new travel size. But the iPad Mini is more than just a smaller face -- it's a whole new product with its own killer features and disappointments.
Joining the iPhone and 10-inch iPad in Apple's iOS lineup, the 7.8-inch iPad enters a crowded market of 7-inch tablets. Here's a closer look at the Mini and how it stacks up against its competitors.
The body
Applying the patented Apple shrink-ray wasn't the only change to the iPad body. The unibody shell is smooth and rounded on the back and edges -- more so than the 10-inch iPad. The lack of sharp edges makes it more confortable to hold in your hands.
The iPad Mini is also thinner and lighter than the 10-inch iPad. The device weighs 0.68 pounds and is 0.28 inches thick. That's thinner than the iPhone 5. Being lighter means your arm doesn't get tired as fast (which is good because the new mini Smart Cover isn't the sturdiest stand).
Taking a look at the new iPad Mini What else is so great about being small? Portability. Taking the 10-inch iPad outside of the house can be a bit of a slog. While it's a great replacement for bulkier laptops, it's still larger than a book. This little guy was built for reading books in cafes, watching movies in hammocks and playing games on the bus during the morning commute.
Is Apple's iPad Mini really worth it?
After extensive pocket testing, we found the iPad Mini fits in most back pockets, from baggy khakis to skinny jeans (just don't sit down). It's easy to hold it with one hand, though some daintier mitts might find palming it a bit more difficult. Toss it in a purse, a saddle bag or the glove compartment.
In many ways, this size feels more natural for a content-consumption device than the larger iPad.
The competition
While the 10-inch iPad dominates tablet sales around the world, the iPad Mini is the new kid in the mid-sized tablet market. A crop of 7-inch tablets on shelves start at $199, including Amazon's Kinlde Fire HD, Google's Nexus 7 tablet and Barnes & Noble's Nook HD.
The iPad Mini is different from these devices in a few key ways: It has a slighter larger and wider 7.8-inch screen, better hardware specs in most categories (screen resolution is a notable exception, which we'll revisit later), access to the simple and refined iOS operating system and Apple's vast selection of quality apps and content.
It also has a much higher price tag. The iPad Mini starts at $329 for the 16GB Wi-Fi only version. The top of the line iPad Mini is 64GB, can connect over Wi-Fi and cellular connections, and costs $659.
When choosing, you'll have to consider how important the Apple features are to you. Is the extra space and Apple ecosystem worth the extra $130? Avid readers and shoppers might get more out of a Nook or the Kindle Fire tablet, which is tightly tied into the Amazon store. (If you're only interested in reading, don't count out the amazing 6-inch, e-ink Amazon Paperwhite tablet.)
The iPad Mini also has a bit of friendly competition from its own big siblings. Apple is still selling multiple generations of 10-inch iPads: the iPad 2 and the newer iPad with "Retina Display" (Apple's term). That Retina iPad was upgraded last month to the fourth generation with a faster processor and a better camera.
The choice between Apple products largely depends on what you're going to use the device for. If it is a laptop replacement, sticking with the faster, larger, higher-resolution 10-inch iPad with Retina is still your best bet. The exception might be situations where the smaller size is a must-have feature, such as working in the field.
The price difference between the iPad 2 and the iPad Mini is negligible -- the iPad 2 is only $70 more -- so that decision comes down to size preference and specs like camera resolution. The iPad Mini has better cameras -- the same ones found on the newest 10-inch iPad.
The screen
This might be a sticking point for some buyers. The iPad Mini screen is basically the iPad 2 screen shrunk down to 7.8 inches. The two devices have the same number of pixels (1024-by-768), but the iPad Mini just packs them into a smaller space. The iPad 2 has 132 pixels per inch, the iPad Mini has 163 pixels per inch.
There are a few reasons Apple might have gone this direction. The benefit of using the iPad 2's display size is that all the apps designed to work on the iPad 2 will work perfectly on the iPad Mini, do developers don't have to redesign their products. Also, the full retina display found on the latest iPad would likely have been a huge drain on battery life.
(We didn't do official battery tests on the Mini, but we didn't need to charge it once in three days, even after streaming this Pearl Jam documentary on Netflix, testing out various apps and surfing the Web frequently.)
Touchscreen technology has marched on since the iPad 2. The third- and fourth-generation iPads both have 2048-by-1536, 264 pixels-per-inch Retina screens. All three of the main competing 7-inch tablets -- the Kindle Fire, Nook and Nexus 7 -- also have higher-resolution screens.
If you've never used a higher-resolution display, you might not even notice. But if you're already using a device with a better screen, the iPad Mini can look a bit grainy. It's like eating at In-N-Out Burger and then trying to go back to McDonald's.
What is great about the display is how it fills the front of the device. The edges around the touchscreen, called bezels, are incredibly thin on the left and right sides. Apple also tweaked the software so that the screen is less sensitive to an errant thumb resting on the front of the device.
Other specs
The screen isn't the only thing the iPad Mini got from the iPad 2. It is using the same processor, the A5. This processor is now two generations old, but it also doesn't have to power a big retina display, so it continues to feel speedy.
There are two speakers for some decent stereo sound (not one as originally thought, according to an iFixit teardown), and the iPad Mini uses the new lightning connecter port.
The cameras on the iPad Mini aren't as good as the iPhone 5, but they are exactly the same as what you'll find on the newest iPad. Taking a photo on the 10-inch iPad has always seemed awkward, but holding up an iPad Mini to take a quick video feels a bit more natural.

"Stuart was already a makeup legend when he started on 'Star Wars,'" said George Lucas, creator of the films.
"He brought with him not only decades of experience, but boundless creative energy. His artistry and craftsmanship will live on forever in the characters he created. His 'Star Wars' creatures may be reinterpreted in new forms by new generations, but at their heart, they continue to be what Stuart created for the original films," Lucas said in a statement.
Playful, impish and imaginative, Freeborn played a pivotal role in developing the character Yoda for "The Empire Strikes Back."
Director Irvin Kershner said Freeborn put his own image into Yoda the Jedi Master, giving the character inquisitive and elfin features with "more than a passing resemblance to Freeborn himself," Lucasfilm said.
Freeborn also put his skills to work in "Oliver Twist," "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "The Omen," four "Superman" films, "Top Secret!" and "The Great Muppet Caper."
Among the more memorable sequences in the "Star Wars" film is the Mos Eisley Cantina, which Freeborn and his team populated by creating Greedo, Walrus Man and Snaggletooth.
He also worked on the tauntaun and wampa ice creatures in "The Empire Strikes Back."
"Return of the Jedi" is considered the "monster movie" of the trilogy, and Freeborn and his team in the United Kingdom developed Jabba the Hutt, which was a massive puppet, and the teddy-bear-like Ewoks.
He was often joined in his makeup work by wife Kay, who died last year, and son Graham, who died in 1996.

Photos: Kidnapped teens rescued
Former in-laws: Castro is a monster
Ohio victims detail life in captivity
"There will be no visits; there will be no phone calls," she said. "He can never be Daddy again. I have no sympathy for the man."
As she mulled the accusations against him, she asked, "How could you?"
"I wonder this whole time, how he could be so good to us, but he (allegedly) took young women, little girls, someone else's babies, away from these families and over the years never felt enough guilt to just give up and let them free."
Gregg did not think anything out of the ordinary was going on in her childhood home.
All that changed Monday when Amanda Berry broke loose. Police freed her fellow captives Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, divulging the secret locked up inside the house at 2207 Seymour Ave.
Snapshots: Who are the three women freed in Cleveland?
When she first heard the news about their captivity, Gregg said, she "just wanted to die."
She had known Berry and DeJesus from her school days.
Peculiarities she noticed about her father over the years started falling into place in a new, grim light, and they are making her feel "horrified," she said.
"This was going on right under my nose."
An odd place to visit
When she came calling, "he would take forever to come to the door," she said. He always had the house locked up tight.
Standing at a window, Castro would often give her a hand signal indicating to her to wait. Then he'd wave her around to the back door, not letting her in through the front of the house.
Once inside, visits were fun and cordial. Gregg, her husband and Castro "ate, looked at photos and listened to music," she said. "He appeared to be happy to see us and never rushed for us to leave."
At times, he would disappear from dinner and give no explanation for his absence.
The music was usually turned up loud, but Gregg thought this to be fitting since Castro was a musician.
Once she asked if she could go upstairs to see her childhood bedroom. Castro coaxed her out of the idea, telling her, "Oh, honey, there's so much junk up there. You don't want to go up there," she said.
Again, she thought nothing of it, "besides him being a pack rat."

Man: I saw DeJesus before she vanished
Disturbing ties between Castro and victims
The basement was always locked.
Prosecutor: 'Kidnapper operated torture chamber'
Clinging to the house
The list of oddities continued.
Castro clung to home, never wanting to leave for more than a day, even to visit Gregg out of state when she lived with her family in Indiana.
"He was adamant in the fact that he wanted to leave home early morning and he had to be back by evening," Gregg said.
Her family often made travel plans with Castro that they then had to cancel because of her father's obsession with his own four walls.
Gregg said that she never saw signs of the 6-year-old at her father's house and that she never saw her with him. But about two months ago, he showed her a picture in his cell phone.
Gregg asked who it was.
Her father told her that the girl was his girlfriend's child by somebody else.
"I figured at the most he had an illegitimate child out there, you know, and I would find out eventually," Gregg said.
She asked him to get a paternity test. She wanted to know if she had another sister out there somewhere.
Now she knows that she does.

Domestic violence
Gregg recalled fond memories of growing up in the house and fun times with her father. He lined up the children in the backyard and trimmed their bangs himself, she said. He took her for rides on his motorcycle.
And he never abused her, she said, or her sisters, as far as she knows.
But he beat their mother, Grimilda Figueroa, whom he accused of fooling around with neighbors. He was very jealous, Gregg said.
"When Mom and Dad were fighting, it's like I just wanted to melt into the ground," she said. "I've seen him basically stomp on her like she was a man," Gregg remembered.
Then after a bludgeoning, her mother had enough, and the family split up. The other children left with her mother, but Gregg stuck by Castro, believing the excuses he made for the violence. She finished growing up under his roof, she said.
How this case differed from the 'House of Horrors'
A daughter divorced
Gregg is through believing in her father and is appalled at the extent of his alleged deception and cruelty.
"To go to the vigils, to show these girls the footage of their parents' pleas for their return, to rape, starve and beat innocent human beings ... I am disgusted."
Gregg wants the girls who suffered in captivity to get the treatment they need, recover as well as they can and have the best lives possible. It was the first thing she mentioned during the interview.
She is relieved to see them and the little girl, her new sister, return to their families.
She hopes they can understand her father's actions are not a reflection on her family.
"We don't have monster in our blood," she said.
Gregg's mother died in 2012 after a bout with brain cancer. Now she has lost her father, too. She still cries for her mother, she said.
"I don't cry for him."

Chinese mothers cash in on formula scare by selling human milk
By Xueqiao Ma, for CNN
updated 7:53 PM EDT, Mon August 5, 2013
Mothers pump excess milk into freezer bags to use at a later date, while some donate it or sell it online.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some mothers in China have begun selling their excess breast milk online
Fears about the safety of infant formula have prompted mothers to seek an alternative
The sale of breast milk occupies a legal gray area in China
Sales of breast milk also occur in other countries
Beijing (CNN) -- Like many mothers, Yan breastfeeds her child. But she's also found a way of making it pay.
After noticing she produces more than she needs, Yan -- who lives with her five-month-old baby in Shenyang, the capital of China's northern Liaoning Province -- decided to sell it.
"I don't want to waste my milk," she told CNN. "I heard that others sell breast milk online, and I thought 'Why not sell mine?' I created a Web page and started my business."
A cursory search for "breast milk" on 58.com, a Chinese online shopping platform, reveals no shortage of mothers offering to sell their breast milk. From Shanghai to Guangzhou, nursing mothers are cashing in on this booming online trade.
"I just need to wait for calls," said Yan. "I provide fresh and frozen breast milk. But you have to pick it up yourself."
China halts imports of powdered milk
According to Yan, the market price is around 5,000 RMB (US$814) for a month's supply. In contrast, a month's worth of conventional baby formula costs around 2,000 RMB (US$325) in China.
After China's tainted milk powder scandal in 2008, many new mothers who were unable to produce enough breast milk for their infant resorted to buying formula overseas — most notably in Hong Kong.
If I don't have enough breast milk I would prefer to purchase human breast milk, because I don't trust our milk powderFang Lu, Chinese newlywed
However, earlier this year Hong Kong introduced limits on the amount of milk powder travelers can take out of the territory, over concerns about shortages and a "black market" in formula sold at vastly inflated prices.
The restrictions have encouraged new mothers to find other means of sourcing milk to feed their babies.
"If I don't have enough breast milk I would prefer to purchase human breast milk, because I don't trust our milk powder," explained Fang Lu, a newlywed who is planning to start a family.
This week, the mistrust of milk powder extended to the biggest single supplier of dairy products to China.
On Saturday, New Zealand company Fonterra announced that a strain of bacteria that causes botulism had been found in batches of an ingredient used to make baby formula, as well as sports drinks.
China immediately halted imports of Fonterra-produced Whey Powder and Dairy Base powder, and increased inspections of New Zealand dairy products.
Some mothers may be turning to others' breast milk as an "safer" alternative but health experts say it doesn't come without risks.
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, babies fed unscreened milk from other mothers could be exposed to infectious diseases, including HIV, and illegal and prescription drugs.
If conditions of breast milk storage are not good, then it's more dangerous... We need laws for the breast milk business.
Wangyan Liu, doctor
It adds that, if not stored properly human milk, "like any type of any type of milk, becomes contaminated and unsafe to drink."
In May, China opened its first breast milk bank at the Guangzhou Maternity and Childcare Hospital and just last week another opened in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.
However, like others around the world, they impose strict controls on who is able to donate, limiting the availability of supply.
The trend of mothers' buying human milk online is not limited to China. A number of sites exist online to match buyers and sellers.
Separately, an increasing number of women are turning to informal milk sharing sites that trust donors to properly store their milk and declare any lifestyle or health risks to prospective recipients. On those sites, the sale of breast milk is strictly prohibited.
In China, trading human breast milk online occupies a legal gray area. While the Ministry of Health Law Supervisor Department has declared that human breast milk cannot be a commodity, no laws regulate or explicitly prohibit its sale.
But while the practice may not be encountering legal obstacles, some people spoken to by CNN expressed discomfort with the growing popularity of the trade.
Wangyan Liu, a doctor from Beijing, said he was concerned about breast milk sales, saying that poorly stored milk could make infants sick.
"If conditions of breast milk storage are not good, then it's more dangerous," he said. "We need laws for the breast milk business."
But for Yan, the emergence of China's breast milk market is a positive development -- and not one that is solely motivated by profit. "I think the business is totally fine. I have excess breast milk and I want to help others -- and earn some money," she said.

Clumsy, but not racist negative campaigning--David Gergen, 360 ContributorSome viewers and readers have inquired about last night's small dust-up on AC 360 about the Hillary Clinton campaign. Anderson asked our panel about various ways that the Clinton campaign has gone negative toward Barack Obama, what's the strategy, what it is accomplishing, and the like. I expressed the view that the Clinton campaign is justified in some of its complaints about this issue, that indeed, Barack did fire first and that he has had more flattering press coverage than she has.But, I added, I questioned the way the Clintonites were counter-attacking. It has seemed clumsy at times, its sudden acceleration contradicts her recent "likeability" emphasis, and it may well backfire because it reminds voters of old-style politics, -the very thing that Barack has been campaigning against.Jennifer Donahue of New Hampshire, another panelist, went farther, she asserted that the Clinton campaign was playing "the race card" agasinst Obama. She and I then got into an exchange about her opinion and I argued that it is unfair to make that charge. I would invite viewers and readers to offer their judgments. My own is that saying someone is playing "the race card" is a serious accusation. To play the race card, as I see it, is to intentionally exploit the race of another person, usually a minority, by appealing to racial prejudices. Growing up in the South, I often saw segregationist Democrats play the race card against moderate or liberal Democrats who were working for greater racial equality. We saw some Republicans in South Carolina play the race card against John McCain in the 2000 primary when they spread outrageous rumors that he had fathered a black child.To paraphrase the Supreme Court, we may not be able to define racism easily but we know it when we see it. By sharp contrast, I do not believe the Clinton campaign or its surrogates, based on the record so far, has been playing the race card by raising questions about Obama's past (and acknowledged) experiments with drugs as a young man. To raise the drug question does not automatically bring his race into the conversation. After all, we had huge questions in the 1992 campaign about Bill Clinton and drugs and in the 2000 campaign about George W. Bush and drugs. A white professor who might have been on the Supreme Court had to withdraw over his past drug use. Past drug use, whether the candidate is black or white, often plays out in American campaigns.Bottom line: it is certainly fair to criticize the Clinton campaign on all sorts of things but, in my view, it is unfair and unseemly to accuse it of playing the race card. Again, I would welcome your view.
Posted By CNN: 2:29 PM ET 20 Comments Hillary and Obama are both such drama queens; can you IMAGINE what they'll be like when they really get the power? People are getting bogged down and distracted by this stuff when the focus must return to what have these candidates done already that shows leadership and success. Rudy says he'll be tough on crime and security and he has done just that in NYC. Romney says he's great at business and he's done that with the SLC Olympic org. On the other hand, Hillary and Obama say they will reduce spending, but neither have voted that way ! All we're hearing from these two (none of which helps America) is promises of what they will do and dissing each other.
Posted By xtina chicago IL : 3:36 PM ET
David - I've heard the phrase 'race card' being used in two different ways.The first is when racial stereotypes are subtly invoked to appeal to racial prejudice, as in the ads against Harold Washington that featured the white 'bimbo' purring 'Harold... call me...' This played into the atavistic fear some whites feel about black men being on the prowl for white women, and appeals to racist 'racial purity' memes.The second is when a black person implies 'you wouldn't be treating me this way if I were white', as Clarence Thomas did with his 'high-tech lynching' complaint. Both techniques are manipulative, but the first is reprehensible. And it's clear this is the meaning Jennifer Donahue intended, since the second meaning doesn't apply to the Clinton camp. I agree with you that Donahue was way out to lunch on this; while using the 'fear of the other' race card would certainly be effective in appealing to portions of the GOP's base, the Democratic Party's base would rear back in revulsion at it. I was glad to see you challenge Donahue's sloppy use of emotionally charged terms. Now if we can just get you to stop referring to Bill Clinton as 'the power behind the skirt'...
Posted By Arachnae, Sterling VA : 3:47 PM ET
I think Jennifer Donahue's comments last night about the "race card" were inflammatory and entirely out of line and I commend you, David, for the professional way you disagreed with her. You are right about the press and even 360 being tougher on Senator Clinton's candidacy. Carl Bernstein is stridently critical of her and now we have Ms. Donahue. Aren't commentators supposed to have at least some semblance of objectivity? Attack ads put forth by the political opposition are bad enough, but I don't want or expect to hear that kind of stuff from a CNN panel. Bringing up a candidate's prior drug use seems like a legitimate issue to me and has nothing to do with race. Give me a break! That's like saying Hillary is interested in health care because she is a woman or that Rudy talks about terrorism because he's a man! And for the record, I am not a committed supporter of Hillary's. I just like to see fairness and balance in the news.

I have watched this show too long. The 10 PM time is good and the discussions are fairly interesting so I tune in to the program. Also, I tune in to listen to one adult person at a time. I am so glad you asked today's question. First and foremost Ms. Donahue has to understand the unmentioned terms of engagement for AC 360.1. Thou shall not interrupt Mr. Gergen. He is the father figure of the show and gets full and fair disclosure each and every night about who he is and who he is working for. Plus he is bright and smart and doesn't talk in circles. He makes sense so listen up.2. Thou shall not interrupt Anderson Cooper (or any other sub-anchor) because he/she is the host or hostess of the show. Ms. Donahue, please remember, you are an invited guest on AC 360 act like it and use good manners. You may have a different opinion and that is okay, but stop interrupting and making accusations.Pay attention to your monitor and ear piece. If you are not talking, you can listen to others and know when to interject your thoughts. 3. Thou shall not interrupt Candy or John because they deserve to be heard. Both of them are smart and working hard especially since they have been in Iowa and N.H. freezing their buns off every night!(And to Candy, congratulations on your weight loss! You are looking wonderful even in those coats!)4. Finally, if you want to argue, babble and make no sense, head over to the other channel at 10 PM and argue your head off there. Scream at each other and then pat each other on the back! There are some wonderful love/hate relationships over there. 5. Remember the viewers of 360 are bright, articulate and educated in our fields. We have travelled the world too. Many of us have had rich experiences. Most of us want a brillant and educated discussion where to quote Anderson......make up our own minds at home. I have made up my mind, when Ms. Donahue is on, my remote is on "mute."I just have to ask, is Ms. Donahue on CNN's payroll? If so, it is going to be a long 11 months!

David, you were absolutely correct -- that in no way was "playing the race card." Obama admitted to using cocaine when he was younger, there was nothing racist about talking about it, although the guy was very stupid in the way he said it.Now, if he had said that Obama had used crack rather than cocaine, that would have been a very slick racist comment, because in this country we view crack and crack users differently, as the current controversy on sentencing laws shows.I admire Obama for talking about his prior drug use -- I think it will soon become a non-issue for candidates, because so many of this generation and younger experimented as teenagers. It is no longer the disqualifying issue that it used to be. And the way Obama handled it was excellent: he pointed out the waste it was and how he was caught in a time of hopelessness. So many people go through that in their teens and early 20s. But he stopped and decided to make something of himself and did exactly that. In my book, that makes it a redemption story -- a positive, not a negative.By the way, I often felt like the only person in the world who understood Bill Clinton's "I did not inhale" line. The first time I smoked pot, I didn't inhale and wondered what the heck all the fuss was about! (I tried it again a few years later, inhaling this time, and disliked the results immensely. And never experimented with other drugs after that.)

I feel drug use is a very legitimate question and issue. People are asked everyday about drug use for jobs, EVEN when joining the military. I am VERY disappointed to see the Barack Obama group quote "the race card.” It really reveals the politics that Barack Obama campaign is playing…….and YES, I would consider this dirty politics. Let’s not divide the United States with separatism. Is Barack Obama going to ask her to resign, for dirty politics? Vm------ New Orleans

The comment on drug use wasn't playing the race card. Bob Kerrey's comments on it being "great" his middle name is Hussein, and that some of his extended family is Muslim, that's definitely playing the race card (or, accurately put, the "ethnicity" card.) And lets not forget the other two "operatives" who spread falsehoods about his being muslim. If Gergen would like to pretend the Clinton machine is above utilizing certain practices to win, by all means he may do so. But to purposefully muddle and misinform a voting constituency as to someone's ethnicity, as the Clinton machine has at least three times now, so as to exploit the public's fears and prejudices of Islam, yes, that's definitely akin to playing the race card, regardless of whether its done through operatives or otherwise.

I agree with you, David. The Clinton campaign is certainly responding to attack ads with questionable ads of their own, but as yet, I don't believe they are using race as a negative issue, and to be honest, I don't believe they will in the future.Should Hilary Clinton go on and win the Democratic nomination, she will need African-American support to win the general election.

Hello David:I'm enjoying your blog posts. You have a very distinctive way of shedding light to what's happening in the political arena.If either candidate wants to show the voters their "likeability", they should stop the attacks against each other. It's really not winning points in my book. During the show last night, I wasn't following Jennifer's line of reasoning on the Clinton camp playing the race card, especially in regards to Obama experimenting with drugs. What benefit would the Clinton campaign get for playing the race card? Wouldn't appear to be a strategy I would follow if I were running for president.

Correct me if I'm wrong -- I was pretty young even in 2000 -- but I don't recall anyone ever implying that either Clinton or Bush *sold* drugs. Bringing up Obama's past is not racist in itself -- he's voluntarily brought it up himself. But implying that he could have sold drugs is entirely different. I can't read minds, so I don't know if it was the Clinton campaign intentionally playing to racial biases -- although when it's not been suggested about a white man and they're the first to bring it up, I find it hard to believe they had no clue. But no matter their intent, I think it will anyway.

David/AC360:It is highly doubtful that the Clinton campaign was playing "the race card" when questioning Obama's experimentation with illegal drugs. Why would the Clinton campaign shoot its own foot? Hillary and Bill Clinton have the support of many minorities.An example of playing "the race card" is Mitt Romney's statement that his father marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. Romney's explanation of his father's absence at the march was clumsy and irresponsible. Jennifer Donahue was also clumsy with her view on "the race card". She had no creditable basis to her statement about her accusation.Any political professional who would be asked to comment on a negative campaign issue should base the accusation on research, facts, or maybe even personal experiences. But I felt she was just talking off the top of her head. David, it was a responsible act of professional journalism when you confronted Jennifer Donahue's absurd statement. Thank you.

Thank you for posting this blog. I watched your show. It is so often in shows like yours that a panelist will come on the show with an agenda and a goal. Jennifer Donahue's goal was try to spin a story cycle about the Clinton campaign playing the race card. Thanks to your other panelist this was nipped in the bud. My broader hope is that people with influence on CNN and other "news" channels do a better job of vetting the panelists on their shows. I see the point of having panelist with different views but I do not appreciate panelists who show up to do a job. This time the job was to do a number on the Clinton campaign. I would not appreciate it if her job was to do a number on any of the candidates.

I totally respect your opinion, and I agree with you on the idea that the Hillary campaign is not intentionally engaging in racism against Obama ny playing the race card.I do think that the race card has been played against Obama by candidates and other entities since he has been running for president. It has always been a traditional racist opinion held by some white people that black people are not qualified to do anything, or do not know enough to do anything, or are plainly incompetant. When Hillary talks about Obama not having enough experience, or not knowing what to do, some white people will take that to mean because he is black he does not know enough to run the country. You could say the Hillary campaign is playing into traditional prejudices by making those statements.Joe Klein from Time Magazine alluded to this and said that all the presidents should take a qualifiying test so all will know if Obama is qualified to be president if elected. This assertion is based in the racist thinking of the past that deemed African Americans academically inferior to whites and tests were needed to show that blacks were actually competant enough to go to school with whites. Under this thinking you could successfully argue that the Hillary campaign has played the race card against Obama. I don't think that she is intentionally doing that, but you could argue the point.Sylvie Grace; Atlanta, Georgia

Dear David,I agree with you. There is no "race card" being played here. I think that any time the temperature starts to rise, whether it be in political campaigns or other arenas there is always the race issue that people like to conjure up. It is juvenile in many instances and frankly, is worn-out. People need to stop playing this game.

I watched 360 last night and I was glad that David Gergen spoke up and challenged Jennifer Donahue's comment. When she made the remark that they were playing "the race card" I thought - what is she talking about.... this argument makes no sense at all. I found Donahue's remarks offensive when she tried to back up her ridiculous charge by saying that references to drug use are anti-African American. Maybe she doesn't get out of New Hampshire enough to know that drug use is across the board: all ethnic groups, all socio-economic groups. ( I don't think New Hampshire is known for its' diversity). If anyone was making racially insensitive remarks it was Donohue herself!I am no fan of Clinton and I would never vote for her, but I do not think any of the comments made by her staff were racially motivated.I agreed with Mr. Gergen, and I am glad that he spoke up and did not let Donohue's charges slip through without a counter argument.

I agree with you. No, I don't think a race card was played.I think perhaps some dirty pool would be more like it. The word racist is thrown around too often these days. I know that racism still exists, but we can't twist every word, every action and put it all under a microscope to find a hidden meaning that may or may not exist.Lorie Ann, Buellton, Calif.

I think that it would be wise to keep in mind intention here. Although we can criticize the Clinton campaign for its attacks, which are seemingly getting more and more "clumsy" as Mr. Gergen pointed out, or as I might say, a bit unprofessional, I don't think that they intentionally play the race card. I see it more as a basic character attack--trying to get their leading opponent from any angle possible. However, the continued stress on Obama's past drug use may for some people, bring in other connotations such as race that are a deep-rooted part of our societal bias and prejudices.

DavidI am glad you disagreed with Ms. Donahue on the Clinton Campaign using the race card. I don't think they did and I don't think they will. Bringing up someone's past drug use is commonplace in elections and in past elections it was not racial as the majority of candidates were white; now that we have an African American candidate does not change this aspect of the campaign by giving it racial overtones. Ms. Donahue's conclusion that it was playing the race card was in error; an error I am glad you corrected. Rather than past drug usage, I think a comparison on what issues Obama voted present on rather than yes/no as well as when Clinton did it too would be more pertinent to how they have handled different issues in their current offices. Their stand so far on different issues would probably be more illuminating than whether one used drugs in one's youth.Annie KateBirmingham AL
