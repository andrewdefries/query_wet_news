Frank Lloyd Wright's plans for greater Baghdad
By Al MatthewsCNN Headline News
Story Tools
(CNN) -- What would the late Frank Lloyd Wright say of today's Baghdad, after sanctions, and after war?
The beloved American architect, in his vigorous old age, drew plans for a new Baghdad.
Wright was invited to build an opera house in downtown Baghdad by King Faisal II. By 1952, Iraq had managed a 50-50 deal with British-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company and Faisal presided over this wealth.
The king was soon calling in architectural star power: Walter Gropius (for Baghdad University); Le Corbusier (part of his plan became Saddam Hussein Gymnasium); and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Wright's politics made him unpopular with the FBI, and never in his career did he win a contract for a federal building. So with a king's commission at age 89, Wright was thinking big.
His site was a small zone in downtown Baghdad. But as he flew over the city, Wright spied a low island in the Tigris, and soon asked if he could use that instead. Reportedly, the king replied, "The island, Mr. Wright, is yours!"
So Wright designed more than an opera house. He drew up plans for two art museums, one modern, one for ancient Sumerian statuary. He drew plans for spherical shopping kiosks, a citrus garden (in honor of Wright's interpretation of the forbidden fruit), and a monument to Haroun al-Rashid, who presided over Baghdad's zenith.
He drew a planetarium alongside the opera house. Likewise, a television broadcast antenna smack in the middle of this appeal to civilization.
Wright hoped to encourage democracy in the kingdom, by which he meant not only public works, but also automobile access. He imagined stylish bridges over the Tigris, tree-lined boulevards, a cultural destination for a city and a region.
The opera house itself is one of Wright's most elaborate buildings. He envisioned 1,700 cars parking there on three levels, along a huge hollowed ziggurat, a graded earth spiral recalling the structures of ancient Mesopotamia, and the circularity of old Baghdad.
The building is aligned with Mecca, and organized by a giant arch defining not only the proscenium, but also the entirety of the profile. Everywhere, the structure is decorated with images from the book, "The Arabian Nights: Tales from a Thousand and One Nights" and it's crowned with a depiction of Aladdin.
Those "Thousand and One Nights" were filled with the tales, often set in Baghdad, told by Shamrazad to King Sharayar. The king had been wronged, and swore to bed a different woman each night before killing her. Shamrazad volunteered to be his victim, then told stories that so charmed him he kept her alive each night to hear what would be told the next. At last, he fell in love. It was this tribute to the power of illusion that inspired Wright in his plans.
But Faisal II was assassinated in a coup July 14, 1958. Wright himself died the next year. The revolutionary government judged Wright's plans "rather grandiose," and they were never realized.
Some who study the region suggest the United States should fund at least one of Wright's buildings. They say, when it comes to building good will, sometimes concrete improvement means the most.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Simon Darby has the kind of house that makes the fathers of his kids' classmates green with envy.As Microsoft's Windows client marketing manger, the self-confessed "technology geek" has all sorts of gadgets installed that make it seem like something out of a futuristic movie.In fact, all of the devices in Darby's home -- from the biometric mouse that has his computer reading fingerprints instead of asking for passwords to the media center in his lounge -- are available for ordinary consumers to buy in shops.Having impressed guests to his Oxford home, Darby decided to let his clients see the technology in action by recreating his front room in London.The result is Life Squared (Life2) -- a mock business, mock home and mock cafe, all fitted with new technologies to show visitors the types of innovations that Microsoft believes will make their lives easier.Marsh Marine, for example, is not a real company. But for the purposes of Life2, it is a very successful boating business, using the latest wireless technology to run a seamless operation.From the moment you step in the door, you are greeted by a receptionist, who jots your name down on an electronic tablet and sends your drink preference to the nearest cafe.Inside the offices, workers make notes on electronic tablets which recognize their handwriting as well as anything typed.The idea is improve people's work-life balance by making their lives more efficient, Darby said.Everyone at Marsh Marine has access to an online database, a type of Intranet that everyone can view and update."There is no more 'month end' -- previously, you would do this stock take of data once a month but you can upload it in real time," Darby told CNN.They can also share data in real time, including technical drawings and diagrams."And instead of having a conversation on the phone. You can visually see it and make sure you're both talking about the same document."Also on show is iMate, a 3G phone that is also a speaking GPS device that can give you directions. It'll also tell you points of interest according to your preferences, which could include the nearest McDonald's restaurant, Hilton Hotel or even a speed camera.On display at "number 42" -- a recreation of Darby's home -- is Media Center.It looks like a TV but acts as more like a computer, playing CDs, slide shows of digital photos, and video on demand.All of this helps with the "immersiveness" of the experience, according to Darby.In the children's room next door, Microsoft shows off Internet Protocol television, or IPTV -- currently being developed in conjunction with Alcatel.It has a function on it that enables users to chat, much as they would over instant messaging (IM), but via television. Individual TV channels, complete with personalized slide shows of digital photos, can be created and access can be given to others, even if they aren't in the same house, similar to an IM buddy list.No launch date has been set for Microsoft's IPTV.The computer in the children's room has a biometric mouse, which enables computer log-ins to happen via fingerprints, instead of needing a password.Darby said the point of the Life2 project was to show what technology was available now.The expo, which runs until February, is not open to the public. Instead Microsoft is showing media and key clients around, hoping they will spread the message that the technology on show will make people's lives easier."It's all about technology fitting in with our lives -- not the other way around," said Darby.

Small forests a big help in curbing carbonBy Chuck Leavell, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSChuck Leavell says plan for preserving forests was bright spot at climate summitHe says a third of U.S. forests are family-owned, can play big role in carbon reductionLaws must incentivize carbon-cutting forest management practices, he saysLeavell: In slow timber market, nudge forest owners toward climate-friendly steps RELATED TOPICS

Environmental Protection
Editor's note: Chuck Leavell is a pianist who has spent 27 years playing keyboards for the Rolling Stones. He is a board member of the American Forest Foundation and recently founded Mother Nature Network, MNN (www.mnn.com), an environmental news and information site. He owns and operates the 2,500-acre Charlane Plantation in Dry Branch, Georgia. Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Even if world leaders haven't finished the job with the global accord produced at the Copenhagen climate talks, the summit was not a total bust. That's because negotiators there outlined a landmark deal aimed at making money grow on trees. The tentative outline would allow countries -- especially developing countries -- to profit from preserving forests, and possibly even peat swamps, grasslands and other ecosystems that help soak up carbon dioxide and soften the blow of climate change. But it's forests that are the main target, due to their knack for absorbing prodigious amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, thereby preventing it from trapping the extra solar heat that causes global warming. Unfortunately, the summit's forest initiatives provided little help to the more than 10 million people like me who manage family-owned forest land in the United States. Since such forests make up more than a third of all forests in the nation, they have the potential to play a huge -- and growing -- role in reducing carbon emissions. Any government action on climate change in this country needs to pay attention to them. It may seem odd for a rock 'n roll piano player to be picking up this cause. Let me explain: Back in the mid 80's when I was in-between Rolling Stone tours, I found myself studying practical forestry. My wife, Rose Lane, and I had inherited land from her grandparents and we were beginning to actively manage our family forest, Charlane Plantation, carrying on the tradition of good stewardship that her family started many generations ago. In 1999, Rosie and I were rewarded for our efforts by being named by the American Tree Farm System, a program of the non-profit conservation group, the American Forest Foundation, as National Outstanding Tree Farmers. We were selected out of some 65,000 other family forest owners, which was a great honor for us. Through the years I have become fascinated and passionate about trees and forests. But I never dreamed that some 25 years later I would be talking about carbon credits, cap and trade, and bio-mass for energy usage. However, these were some of the hot topics being discussed at the recent Copenhagen climate talks, which I followed with great interest. A full 10 percent of carbon emissions in the United States every year are absorbed by forests and forest products, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but that number could increase if the right economic incentives were put in place. Forests can supply us with clean, renewable energy, such as biofuels, that, if used to replace fossil fuels, also reduce carbon emissions. They can serve as a "carbon offset" under a cap-and-trade system that allows forest owners to sell their enhanced carbon storage to an emitter when that emitter is unable to meet its limits on greenhouse gas pollution. President Obama and the Senate will soon turn their attention again to proposed climate change legislation, which will no doubt continue to be controversial because of its complexity and broad impact on the environment and the economy. Carbon trading is an important part of any approach, but more is needed to make environmentally-friendly steps worthwhile for private forest landowners. Many smaller forest landowners in the United States may not be able to participate in a cap and trade program because the set-up costs for trading carbon -- such as verification of storage and monitoring costs -- are just too expensive for owners with lot sizes less than 100 acres. Yet together these smaller family-owned U.S. forests make up a significant "carbon sink" of 119 million acres. The nation could immediately put this land to work in helping combat climate change, but first, when it considers new legislation, Congress must provide improved offset market opportunities for forest owners, and incentives for forest management practices that enhance carbon storage, like those included in pending legislation offered by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, and six of her colleagues. Such practices include replanting trees, changing timber rotations, and avoiding deforestation. The carbon reduced would supplement the reductions achieved via cap and trade. Congress should consider compensating landowners to undertake these strategies. Family forest owners like me provide about 60 percent of all U.S. lumber supplies. With the slow housing construction market, and timber prices near record lows, it's a great time to direct forest owners toward conservation-minded forest practices. Providing forest owners with a modest income stream for carbon-enhancing forest activities is the key. When a developer comes knocking, it helps when a forest owner already has a satisfactory economic incentive in place to nudge that owner toward taking the step that helps the climate and protects forests, instead of, say, clear-cutting the land. Of course, besides climate improvement, conservation brings the other forest benefits we cherish: clean air, safe drinking water, wildlife, and recreation. I hope that, beyond Copenhagen, our lawmakers, and folks all over the United States, will support the creation of the economic incentives that will help us to attain our nation's environmental goals. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chuck Leavell.

Waiting for a 'good girl' to come homeBy Philip Rosenbaum, Nancy Grace producer Kimberly Arrington was 16 when she disappeared October 30, 1998, in Montgomery, Alabama. STORY HIGHLIGHTSKimberly Arrington, 16, disappeared October 30, 1998, in Montgomery, AlabamaShe told her mother she was walking to nearby CVS pharmacy Police have no leads, no witnesses; they don't even know if she arrived at CVSKnow something?

National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
New York (CNN) -- Kimberly Arrington was 16 when she disappeared more than a decade ago, and her father still waits for her to come home. So does a little girl she never met who carries her name. Walter Arrington remembers "a good girl" who enjoyed listening to music, dancing and learning computers at school, where she was well-behaved. "I've been going through this for the last 12 years, and I feel like this might be my last chance of ever seeing my daughter or somebody recovering her," he said, hoping a story would compel someone to come forward. Someone may have asked his daughter for directions, Walter Arrington believes, and forced her into a car as she walked to a CVS pharmacy near her home Montgomery, Alabama, on the day before Halloween, October 30, 1998. "Most people liked her, and she was very friendly towards everybody,'' he said. "I felt like maybe that's part of the reason why they got her.'' Walter Arrington was leaving for work the last time he saw his daughter. She was already talking about Christmas, he said, asking about her gifts. That's the picture that stays in his mind. "I can hear her talking and see her talking from that day now,'' Walter Arrington said. "And I can't go on any further, because I'm at a standstill until I find out what happened to her. ... It is something that I carry with me every day.'' Kimberly Arrington left the family's home about 5 p.m., telling her mother where she was going, according to police. And then she simply vanished. Kim Arrington's mother, who was ill, died in 2005. "It wasn't easy for her, either,'' Walter Arrington said, recalling that one of the last things his wife asked was whether he will continue to look for Kim. Whatever her fate, Kimberly Arrington's name lives on. Six years ago, her sister Jennifer named her daughter Kim, after her missing aunt. The girl, who knows that her mother's sister is missing, often asks when she's going to meet "Auntie Kim." Her disappearance remains a mystery with few clues and no strong leads, according to investigators in Montgomery. Despite dozens of interviews with family, friends, classmates and city residents, no viable witnesses were found in the days, months and years that followed, said Capt. Keith Barnett of the Montgomery Police Department. "We had nobody that saw her get snatched up. Nobody found her purse or jacket or anything on the side of the road,'' Barnett said. "She just disappeared. She left home and disappeared.'' Whether Arrington made it to the pharmacy after she left home shortly after 5 p.m. will probably never be known. No credible witnesses came forward, and there was no surveillance video from the store. "For an older girl to be abducted and vanish -- if that's what really happened -- would be unusual,'' Barnett said. He explained that most abductors target a younger child because they're ''easier to manipulate, to get in the vehicles, easier to control.'' Sixteen-year-olds such as Arrington would put up more of a fight because they're stronger, he said. Known sex offenders in the area were questioned, and police looked into rumors and speculation. Still, a suspect was never found. Police canvassed the area from Arrington's house to the CVS store, searching for signs of struggle and belongings she may have dropped. But they came up empty-handed. It's an unsolved missing persons case, said Barnett, who avoids using the term "cold case." "It'll never be closed until she's located one way or another, however she's found,'' he said, adding that the department will look into any tip. "Whether we find her deceased or whether we find her alive, we'd like to bring some kind of closure to the family,'' Barnett said. Because her DNA is not available, police have sent samples from her father and one of her sisters to a national database. In the hours after she vanished, Arrington was considered a runaway, which is indicated on the police report. "All we thought we had was possibly a girl that left home for a few hours to be with friends, boyfriends or whatever and was coming back home,'' said Lt. Rickey Fennie, who is now in charge of the investigation. "But it didn't take long for us to realize that probably was not the case.'' Asked whether time or crucial opportunities to find her may have been lost, Barnett said: ''Unfortunately, at the initial time of the report, we had no information or evidence from anyone, including the parents, that pointed at foul play being involved.'' Barnett says there was a two- to three-hour delay when Arrington's parents reported her missing because they had gone looking for her on their own. "So, no, I do not feel that any vital leads were missed, because all the proper actions were taken as soon as it looked as if this might be more than a runaway,'' he said. According to the missing-person posters, Arrington was 5'4'' and 110 pounds. She was wearing a gray Bugle Boy shirt with a collar, light blue jeans and white Reebok sneakers with gray trim. She has a scar on her stomach. Now she would be 27 years old. Anyone with more information about Arrington's disappearance is asked to call the Montgomery Police Department at 1-334-241-2790 or the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST.

Report: U.S. hikers seized by Iranian police in Iraqi territoryBy the CNN Wire Staff Were hikers seized in Iraq, not Iran?STORY HIGHLIGHTS Story alleges witnesses saw American hikers taken across border by Iranian police State Department says it can't corroborate the report The Nation says reporting is based on a five-month investigation RELATED TOPICS
Sarah Shourd
Shane Bauer
Josh Fattal
Iran
(CNN) -- The mothers of U.S. hikers held by Iran said a magazine article that contradicts government claims they crossed the border before their arrests is "concerning" and raises many questions. The article written for the July 12 edition of The Nation cites two witnesses who said they saw members of Iran's national police force cross the border into northern Iraq to apprehend Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal. "The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out of curiosity, say that around 2 p.m. on July 31 (2009), as the hikers descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA, Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the Iranian side using 'threatening' and 'menacing' gestures," the article says. "When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction, and apprehended them," according to the article. Bauer has previously denied government claims that the hikers crossed into Iranian territory. The Nation: U.S. hikers were seized in Iraq The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in northern Iraq called Zalem, according to the story written by Babak Sarfaraz, a pseudonym for a journalist in Iran. Since the community lies a few miles from the Iranian border, they asked not to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian forces, the article said. The magazine said its reporting was based on a five-month investigation. CNN could not independently confirm the story and a senior State Department official said the agency can't corroborate the report. "It was very concerning for me to see the details of this," Cindy Hickey, Bauer's mother, told CNN. "It sends a shudder down my spine." "All of this is still mysterious," said Nora Shourd. "This raises a lot of questions for us." The three Americans have been held for nearly a year. Their mothers visited them in Iran in May. Last week, the women said the Iranian government should either prosecute or free the three. In a statement, the mothers also called for more consular access for their children and for them to be able to call their families. They also asked that Shourd be moved from solitary confinement. "Shane, Sarah and Josh have been detained in Iran without due process for almost 11 months, in continued violation of Iranian and international law," the mothers said. "To continue to detain our children without regard for their legal and human rights reinforces suspicions that they are being held in a cynical attempt by Iran to exert leverage with the United States. Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to release them or move forward with a fair trial in which our children can openly answer any allegations against them."CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt and Elise Labott contributed to this report.

U.S. withdrawal is 'tough love' for disbelieving Afghans
By Douglas Wissing, Special for CNN
updated 1:49 PM EST, Wed January 23, 2013
A bomb-suited soldier with the Afghan National Army trains to defuse explosives in Khost Province, eastern Afghanistan.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Front-line U.S. soldiers stepping back, forcing Afghans to step up
Wissing: "Shoulder-to-shoulder" policy with Afghan troops is now an "after you" policy
Some Afghans don't believe that U.S. will leave or that Afghans are ready to take their place
But U.S. troops are already dismantling some bases
Editor's note: Douglas Wissing is an independent journalist and author of "Funding the Enemy: How U.S. Taxpayers Bankroll the Taliban." He is embedded with U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Forward Operating Base Salerno, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As Presidents Barack Obama and Hamid Karzai parry over troop levels and assistance, "retrograde" is the operant word I am hearing from U.S. commanders in Afghanistan. A nuanced military term for withdrawal, retrograde defines operations in this insurgency-plagued land.
After more than a decade of U.S.-led warfare, American commanders are now insisting their Afghan counterparts take over the fight.
The 101st Airborne Division's Rakkasan Brigade is the battle-space owner of eastern Afghanistan's restive Khost and Paktia provinces, both of which border Pakistan's anarchic tribal regions.
In the brigade headquarters at Forward Operating Base Salerno -- a building hardened against rocket and mortar attack -- Rakkasan Deputy Commander Col. Tim Sullivan told me, "Our mission was to go from a partnered role with the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) to an advise and assist role. We kind of gave it the 'tough love' approach."
Turning off the lights in Afghanistan
Who is calling the shots in Afghanistan?
Prince Harry describes deployment
Suicide bombers attack Afghan police With the announced U.S. withdrawal in 2014, American officers have no choice but to push the Afghan security forces forward.
What does the future hold for Afghanistan?
It's a big change for Afghan commanders used to U.S. troops taking the lead and accustomed to having the formidable U.S. firepower and air support.
Sullivan talked of turning down a cosseted Afghan commander who demanded helicopter transport to one of his bases. "We fly them nowhere," Sullivan told me. "It's a big transition. It has to happen. It's a clash of wills."
Sullivan is the right man for the job. A hulking, gravel-voiced Brooklynite from an Irish Catholic family of seven boys, Sullivan is a West Point graduate who has served in Somalia, Haiti, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Sullivan and other U.S. officers in Afghanistan talk about the need to transition to "Afghan Good Enough"" a sustainable Afghan security force that does it the Afghan way.
The U.S. partnering strategy of "Shohna ba Shohna" (Shoulder to Shoulder) has abruptly given way to "After You" as Afghan security forces take the lead -- sometimes reluctantly.
"Across the A/O (Area of Operations), I wouldn't paint a rosy picture," Sullivan says. "We've had some very good success. We've had some moderate success. We have not encountered any nightmares."
Across the insurgent heartland of eastern and southern Afghanistan, there's a palletizing fever as U.S. equipment is packed for shipment.
In military briefings, U.S. bases scheduled for imminent closure are highlighted on PowerPoint maps.
Long convoys of armored vehicles are making their way back from forward bases as combat outposts are closed or transferred to Afghan security forces.
Remaining U.S. bases are groaning with the influx of transiting troops and contractors, housed in new barrios of Alaska tents and "tin-can" metal housing pods.
Turning off the lights in Afghanistan
Some bases are being dismantled and returned to nature. Combat Outpost Tillman, named after NFL star and Special Forces soldier Pat Tillman who died in an infamous friendly fire incident, was one of those closed.
"We scraped it clean," Sullivan said. U.S. anti-IED teams traveled north to blow up the watchtowers.
The base is now a soccer field, where Afghan boys play a wolfish style of football.
As Obama administration representatives float the big round trial balloon of zero troops in Afghanistan, soldiers here talk about the spring 2013 drawdown of 20% of the remaining 66,000 US troops, with another 50% to be gone soon after.
How are the Afghans responding to U.S. retrograde? Among some, there is clearly denial. They simply can't imagine a country rich enough, or foolish enough, to just walk away from the enormous investment poured into these bases, many just built during the boom that accompanied Obama's troop surge.
Aid and development money is drying up. I listened to one Afghan government farm worker in insecure Zabul Province insist that a U.S. military development team needed to build a fence around a section of a U.S.-financed Afghan demonstration farm.
The U.S. commander patiently told the farmer he should ask his provincial agriculture minister to do it. "We don't do projects anymore," the commander repeatedly said. The farmer, who sported a bright gold wristwatch that signifies inordinate wealth (and sometimes indicates Taliban ties), retorted that the ministry was "weak," so the American "friends" needed to do it.
Many Afghans tell me they are very pessimistic about post-2014 security. One Afghan who has translated for U.S. forces in Khost Province for nine years says, "The Afghan situation right now is kind of bad. If the American forces withdraw from Afghanistan, I don't think the Afghan army is strong enough to defend everybody."
Karzai, in his own words, on U.S. troops
He told me he hoped coalition forces would keep training the Afghan security forces. "Right now if the coalition forces would leave, it's going to be so hard for the Afghan people."
Like many of his colleagues, the educated interpreter, whose father was an Afghan National Police general, is applying for a special U.S. immigration visa.
Other Afghans are getting angry. One U.S. commander in southern Afghanistan told me about his Afghan counterpart flaring up when he learned American support was being quickly scaled back. It's a dictum that "retrograde under contact" (withdrawal under pressure) is among the most difficult of military operations. At some point when troop levels have dropped, all a force can do is protect itself.
As U.S. forces withdraw after well over a decade of war, the insurgents have responded in various ways. IEDs continue to be the weapon of choice. Media-magnet complex attacks, such as the spectacular attacks on Kabul and Camp Bastion when Britain's Prince Harry was stationed there, broadcast the insurgency is still thriving.
In some formerly insecure provinces such as Khost, insurgent attacks have diminished. I asked Sullivan about the contention that attacks dropped because casualty-cautious U.S. commanders ordered fewer combat patrols.
Sullivan challenged the idea that U.S. soldiers are not "out there," saying soldiers constantly travel the roads on retrograde convoys.
"We're not finding the mother lodes of caches (insurgent military supplies) when we go out," he says. "We're not getting a fight."
Then I asked about the assessment that Afghan insurgents are just husbanding their forces while the U.S. withdraws. "Husbanding of forces," Sullivan quickly agrees. "I might buy that."

Has U.S. started an Internet war?
By Bruce Schneier, Special to CNN
updated 10:46 AM EDT, Tue June 18, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bruce Schneier: U.S. is pursuing policies that are destabilizing and expensive Schneier: The cyberwar arms race will define the Internet in the 21st century He asks: How much of what the U.S. does is an act of war by international definitions? Schneier: We need more transparency, cooperation and viable cyberweapons treaties
Editor's note: Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and author of "Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust Society Needs to Survive." (CNN) -- Today, the United States is conducting offensive cyberwar actions around the world.
More than passively eavesdropping, we're penetrating and damaging foreign networks for both espionage and to ready them for attack. We're creating custom-designed Internet weapons, pre-targeted and ready to be "fired" against some piece of another country's electronic infrastructure on a moment's notice.
This is much worse than what we're accusing China of doing to us. We're pursuing policies that are both expensive and destabilizing and aren't making the Internet any safer. We're reacting from fear, and causing other countries to counter-react from fear. We're ignoring resilience in favor of offense.
Bruce Schneier
Welcome to the cyberwar arms race, an arms race that will define the Internet in the 21st century.
Presidential Policy Directive 20, issued last October and released by Edward Snowden, outlines U.S. cyberwar policy. Most of it isn't very interesting, but there are two paragraphs about "Offensive Cyber Effect Operations," or OCEO, that are intriguing:
"OECO can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging. The development and sustainment of OCEO capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.
"The United States Government shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities, and execute those capabilities in a manner consistent with the provisions of this directive."
Opinion: Cyber arms control? Forget about it
Obama: NSA programs are transparent
Releasing NSA leaks: A public service?
NSA fallout could be 'harmful'
Could the NSA leaker defect to China?
These two paragraphs, and another paragraph about OCEO, are the only parts of the document classified "top secret." And that's because what they're saying is very dangerous.
Cyberattacks have the potential to be both immediate and devastating. They can disrupt communications systems, disable national infrastructure, or, as in the case of Stuxnet, destroy nuclear reactors; but only if they've been created and targeted beforehand. Before launching cyberattacks against another country, we have to go through several steps.
We have to study the details of the computer systems they're running and determine the vulnerabilities of those systems. If we can't find exploitable vulnerabilities, we need to create them: leaving "back doors" in hacker speak. Then we have to build new cyberweapons designed specifically to attack those systems.
Sometimes we have to embed the hostile code in those networks, these are called "logic bombs," to be unleashed in the future. And we have to keep penetrating those foreign networks, because computer systems always change and we need to ensure that the cyberweapons are still effective.
Like our nuclear arsenal during the Cold War, our cyberweapons arsenal must be pretargeted and ready to launch.
That's what Obama directed the U.S. Cyber Command to do. We can see glimpses in how effective we are in Snowden's allegations that the NSA is currently penetrating foreign networks around the world: "We hack network backbones -- like huge Internet routers, basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one."
The NSA and the U.S. Cyber Command are basically the same thing. They're both at Fort Meade in Maryland, and they're both led by Gen. Keith Alexander. The same people who hack network backbones are also building weapons to destroy those backbones. At a March Senate briefing, Alexander boasted of creating more than a dozen offensive cyber units.
Longtime NSA watcher James Bamford reached the same conclusion in his recent profile of Alexander and the U.S. Cyber Command (written before the Snowden revelations). He discussed some of the many cyberweapons the U.S. purchases:
"According to Defense News' C4ISR Journal and Bloomberg Businessweek, Endgame also offers its intelligence clients -- agencies like Cyber Command, the NSA, the CIA, and British intelligence -- a unique map showing them exactly where their targets are located. Dubbed Bonesaw, the map displays the geolocation and digital address of basically every device connected to the Internet around the world, providing what's called network situational awareness. The client locates a region on the password-protected web-based map, then picks a country and city -- say, Beijing, China. Next the client types in the name of the target organization, such as the Ministry of Public Security's No. 3 Research Institute, which is responsible for computer security -- or simply enters its address, 6 Zhengyi Road. The map will then display what software is running on the computers inside the facility, what types of malware some may contain, and a menu of custom-designed exploits that can be used to secretly gain entry. It can also pinpoint those devices infected with malware, such as the Conficker worm, as well as networks turned into botnets and zombies -- the equivalent of a back door left open...
"The buying and using of such a subscription by nation-states could be seen as an act of war. 'If you are engaged in reconnaissance on an adversary's systems, you are laying the electronic battlefield and preparing to use it' wrote Mike Jacobs, a former NSA director for information assurance, in a McAfee report on cyberwarfare. 'In my opinion, these activities constitute acts of war, or at least a prelude to future acts of war.' The question is, who else is on the secretive company's client list? Because there is as of yet no oversight or regulation of the cyberweapons trade, companies in the cyber-industrial complex are free to sell to whomever they wish. "It should be illegal,' said the former senior intelligence official involved in cyberwarfare. 'I knew about Endgame when I was in intelligence. The intelligence community didn't like it, but they're the largest consumer of that business.'"
That's the key question: How much of what the United States is currently doing is an act of war by international definitions? Already we're accusing China of penetrating our systems in order to map "military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis." What PPD-20 and Snowden describe is much worse, and certainly China, and other countries, are doing the same.
All of this mapping of vulnerabilities and keeping them secret for offensive use makes the Internet less secure, and these pre-targeted, ready-to-unleash cyberweapons are destabalizing forces on international relationships. Rooting around other countries' networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, creating back doors, and leaving logic bombs could easily be construed as an act of war. And all it takes is one over-achieving national leader for this all to tumble into actual war.
It's time to stop the madness. Yes, our military needs to invest in cyberwar capabilities, but we also need international rules of cyberwar, more transparency from our own government on what we are and are not doing, international cooperation between governments and viable cyberweapons treaties. Yes, these are difficult. Yes, it's a long slow process. Yes, there won't be international consensus, certainly not in the beginning. But even with all of those problems, it's a better path to go down than the one we're on now.
We can start by taking most of the money we're investing in offensive cyberwar capabilities and spend them on national cyberspace resilience. MAD, mutually assured destruction, made sense because there were two superpowers opposing each other. On the Internet there are all sorts of different powers, from nation-states to much less organized groups. An arsenal of cyberweapons begs to be used, and, as we learned from Stuxnet, there's always collateral damage to innocents when they are. We're much safer with a strong defense than with a counterbalancing offense.

Train mysteriously runs loose in Chicago, injuring dozens
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 4:11 PM EDT, Mon September 30, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The train that caused the accident had been parked in a service yard
NEW: Authorities are investigating whether someone climbed on board
NEW: 48 people were injured; 33 taken to hospitals, CNN affiliate WLS reported
The crash affected Chicago's Monday morning commute
(CNN) -- A Chicago commuter train that was parked in a service yard somehow moved onto a rail line and smashed into an oncoming train early Monday, injuring dozens of people.
How it happened is a mystery.
"I don't know the last time, if ever, that this has happened" on the Chicago Transit Authority system, spokesman Brian Steele said.
There are "more questions than answers" about the incident in Forest Park, Illinois, he said.
At least 48 people were injured; 33 of them were transported to hospitals, Forest Park Mayor Anthony Calderone told CNN affiliate WLS. They are believed to have minor injuries.

Dozens injured in Chicago train crash
It was not immediately clear how many passengers were aboard the train.
Investigators are not characterizing the incident as a runaway train at this point, Steele said.
A central question: whether anyone had climbed on board the empty train and set it in motion.
"In order for a train to move, it has to be energized," said Ronald Ester, vice president of CTA Rail Operations.
"We call it unlocking the master controller," he said. The train would have needed to be placed in power position manually.
Authorities are looking at video feeds from the platforms and from some rail cars. They're also interviewing workers who were nearby.
It's unknown whether there were criminal activities, Steele said. Authorities did not immediately find windows broken, doors pried open or graffiti on the train.
The train that caused the accident had four cars; the one with passengers aboard had eight.
The incident took place about 8 a.m.
Train service continued but did not stop at Harlem, near the site of the crash. Shuttle buses were made available.
Steele emphasized that the CTA has "a very strong safety record."

NSA scandal highlights Obama's unfulfilled promise
By Julian Zelizer, CNN Contributor
updated 3:10 PM EDT, Mon October 28, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Julian Zelizer: Barack Obama promised to reverse George W. Bush's unilateral approach
He says by sticking with Bush's policies, Obama has disappointed allies, friends
Zelizer: Obama needs to make good on his promise to have U.S. work better with the world
Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and "Governing America."
(CNN) -- The scandal over allegations about NSA surveillance overseas, including monitoring of the cell phone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and millions of phone calls in France, is another huge blow to President Barack Obama.
The news has caused a big uproar in Western Europe, with Merkel demanding a response from Washington. It was "incredible that an allied country like the United States and at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification," said Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Prime Minister of France. "Trust needs to be rebuilt," Merkel said.
While observers warn these complaints are hypocritical and have more to do with domestic politics in Western Europe than true feelings about the United States, this incident is nonetheless much more than a mere blip in the time line of Obama's presidency. The recent National Security Agency revelation is one more step in a series of revelations about practices that have undercut a central promise that candidate Obama made in 2008 -- to repair America's standing in the world.
Julian Zelizer
When Obama took office, America's position in the global community had greatly deteriorated. President George W. Bush's war in Iraq, and his unilateral approach to foreign policy, had generated tremendous distrust and anger overseas, including among our closest allies.
So, too, had Bush's apparent disregard for civil liberties and willingness to ignore international standards against the use of torture. The United States was seen as a country that acted solely in its own interest and that cared little for protecting strong and durable multilateral alliances. The United States, in the minds of its critics, also took reckless actions to defend its national security interests without thinking about the consequences.
Obama was determined to correct this. This had been a constant theme of his campaign against presidential opponent Sen. John McCain, more so than almost any domestic issue. In June 2008, speaking in Germany near the place where the Berlin Wall once stood, Obama said that, "In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in the world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common."
He continued to expound on this theme in his first year as president. His stirring speech in Cairo in June 2009 offered inspirational words to many of his supporters, evidence that the president was serious about fixing the damage that had occurred under Bush.
But the promise is unfulfilled. Over the years, it has become clear that Obama left much more of Bush's foreign policy framework in place than many of his supporters had expected.
He continued with an extremely aggressive campaign against terrorist networks, employing drone strikes to destroy networks even when there have been significant civilian causalities, allowing for tough interrogation techniques and detention policies and depending on secret processes that created little accountability for what the government was doing, other than when leakers revealed classified information. Inconsistent policies toward authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes in countries such as Syria, as well as turbulence in Egypt following the fall of Hosni Mubarak, have greatly dampened the enthusiasm about Obama that had existed after 2008.
Some did it for the money, some did it for idealism, others didn't do it at all. The United States has seen a number of high-profile leak scandals in the years, most recently involving former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed himself as the leaker of details of U.S. government surveillance programs run by the U.S. National Security Agency to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and Internet traffic of virtually all Americans. Snowden has been granted temporary asylum in Russia after initially fleeing to Hong Kong. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, over the leaks.
Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers in 1971. The top-secret documents revealed that senior American leaders, including three presidents, knew the Vietnam War was an unwinnable, tragic quagmire. Further, they showed that the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war. Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy. During his trial, the court learned that President Richard Nixon's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg, illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist's office. All charges against him were dropped. Since then he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer.
Jonathan Pollard is a divisive figure in U.S.-Israel relations. The former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst was caught spying for Israel in 1985 and was sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly called for President Barack Obama to release Pollard after Pollard's wife appealed to Netanyahu.
Wen Ho Lee was a scientist at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico who was charged with 59 counts of downloading classified information onto computer tapes and passing it to China. Lee eventually agreed to plead guilty to a since count of mishandling classified information after prosecutors deemed their case to be too weak. He was released after nine months in solitary confinement. Lee later received a $1.6 million in separate settlements with the government and five news agencies after he sued them, accusing the government of leaking damaging information about him to the media.
Members of the Bush administration were accused retaliating against Valerie Plame, pictured, by blowing her cover in 2003 as a U.S. intelligence operative, after her husband, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, wrote a series of New York Times op-eds questioning the basis of certain facts the administration used to make the argument to go to war in Iraq. In 2007, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, was convicted on charges related to the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury in connection with the case. His 30-month sentence was commuted by President George W. Bush. Cheney told a special prosecutor in 2004 that he had no idea who leaked the information. Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA employee, pleaded guilty to espionage charges in 1994 and was sentenced to life in prison. Ames was a CIA case worker who specialized in Soviet intelligence services and had been passing classified information to the KGB since 1985. U.S. intelligence officials believe that information passed along by Ames led to the arrest and execution of Russian officials they had recruited to spy for them.
Robert Hanssen pleaded guilty to espionage charges in 2001 in return for the government not seeking the death penalty. Hanssen began spying for the Soviet Union in 1979, three years after going to work for the FBI and prosecutors said he collected $1.4 million for the information he turned over to the Cold War enemy. In 1981, Hanssen's wife caught him with classified documents and convinced him to stop spying, but he started passing secrets to the Soviets again four years later. In 1991, he broke off relations with the KGB, but resumed his espionage career in 1999, this time with the Russian Intelligence Service. He was arrested after making a drop in a Virginia park in 2001.
John Walker ran a father and son spy ring, passing classified material to the Soviet Union from 1967 to 1985. Walker was a Navy communication specialist with financial difficulties when he walked into the Soviet Embassy and sold a piece of cyphering equipment. Navy and Defense officials said that Walker enabled the Soviet Union to unscramble military communications and pinpoint the location of U.S. submarines at all times. As part of his plea deal, prosecutors promised leniency for Walker's son Michael Walker, a former Navy seaman.
Army Pvt. Bradley Manning was convicted July 30 of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos to WikiLeaks, and the counts against him included violations of the Espionage Act. He was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges but acquitted of the most serious charge -- aiding the enemy. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in military prison on August 21.

Sharing secrets: U.S. intelligence leaks
Nor did Obama do much to strengthen civil liberties. The public has begun to learn how extensive the surveillance has been on their phones, on their computers and every other type of communication that occurs. In short, the government has been watching.
To be sure, the success at generally preventing terrorist strikes within the U.S., barring Boston, is a central accomplishment of his presidency. But the difficulties he has faced achieving the balance he promised in relations with the rest of the world have come with a cost.
The NSA issue began with a debate about the proper domestic balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism and has now has extended into the realm of diplomacy.
Obama needs to make this right. The controversy hurts the ability of the United States to maintain strong relations with the allies whose support is essential to the war on terrorism, as well as in fighting against other global threats. He must provide answers and show that the government is responding to concerns about NSA practices.
One administration official has told the Wall Street Journal that President Obama had been unaware of NSA spying on 35 world leaders and that, as soon as he learned of the practice through an internal review (a response to the political outrage over the revelations of the spy program), he put parts of the program to an end. Even if this is the case -- and the president will need to make clear this is so given how cynical and skeptical the world has become about U.S. political rhetoric on these matters -- the information begs the question of how the NSA was allowed to remain so unaccountable even to the Commander-in-Chief and, more importantly, what steps President Obama will now take to make sure we conduct our counterterrorism programs within some kinds of parameters and guidelines.
If Obama does nothing further, the ongoing revelations will leave behind the same kinds of problems that he, as a candidate, understood to be so devastating in 2008.

NBA star Tony Parker drawn into 'quenelle' anti-Semitic row
updated 6:18 AM EST, Tue December 31, 2013
Tony Parker is a hero in his native France and with basketball fans in the United States.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NBA star Tony Parker apologizes for using "quenelle" gesture
Parker said he did not realize it was associated with anti-Semitism French footballer Nicolas Anelka says he will not repeat the "celebration"
Two other French EPL stars admit to doing 'quenelle' signal (CNN) -- NBA superstar Tony Parker was forced to apologize Monday for using the same anti-Semitic gesture which has landed former France international footballer Nicolas Anelka in hot water.
Anelka, who plays for English Premier League side West Bromwich Albion, performed the so-called "quenelle" -- pointing his right arm straight down and touching that arm with his left hand -- in celebrating a goal in a match against West Ham Saturday. Some have called the "quenelle" a Nazi salute in reverse.
Anelka is a friend of controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who popularized the "quenelle" and has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism.
With the English Football Association (FA) investigating the incident, Anelka has promised not to do it again.

"The club fully acknowledges that Nicolas' goal celebration has caused offense in some quarters and has asked Nicolas not to perform the gesture again. Nicolas immediately agreed to adhere to this request," said a statement on the West Bromwich Albion website Monday.
Anelka's compatriot Parker came under the spotlight Sunday when a picture from three years ago surfaced of him doing the "quenelle."
The point guard has released a statement saying he was not aware at the time that it was offensive or harmful.
"While this gesture has been part of French culture for many years, it was not until recently that I learned of the very negative concerns associated with it," he said.

"Since I have been made aware of the seriousness of this gesture, I will certainly never repeat the gesture and sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding or harm relating to my actions.
"Hopefully this incident will serve to educate others that we need to be more aware that things that may seem innocuous can actually have a history of hate and hurt."
Anelka has also denied his gesture was anti-Semitic and stated on Twitter that it was simply a "special dedication" to his friend Dieudonne.

Two other French EPL players were drawn into the controversy Monday, with Manchester City's Samir Nasri and Mamadou Sakho of Liverpool, photographed performing the gesture.
Nasri took to social media to say his gesture was to symbolize "being against the system."
He tweeted: "It has absolutely nothing to do with being anti semitic or against Jewish people. I apologise for causing any hurt to anyone who might have."
Sakho said he was tricked into performing the signal. He wrote on his Twitter account: "This photo was taken six months ago, I did not know the meaning of this gesture, I got trapped!"

LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- The adoptive parents of a self-confessed killer have filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles County and its adoption workers, claiming social workers withheld crucial information that would have stopped them from adopting him as an infant.
MESSAGE BOARD
Adoption issues
Just before he was set to go on trial for murder a little more than a year ago, Jeremy Strohmeyer dropped his defense and told the court he killed 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson with premeditation and deliberation in a casino restroom in Primm, Nevada, in May of 1997. "It could have been prevented by me, had I been armed with the knowledge I have now -- but also by others, had they done the right thing," Strohmeyer said at his sentencing hearing. Strohmeyer's adoptive parents contend they were not told by adoption workers that Jeremy's birth mother was mentally ill
Biological mother hospitalized for schizophrenia
The knowledge he referred to was that his biological mother had severe mental problems.
"They knew that she had been hospitalized, Jeremy's birth mother, 60 times prior to Jeremy's birth," said his adoptive mother, Winnie Strohmeyer. "That she had been diagnosed in 1976 as a chronic schizophrenic. Why would you withhold that information?" The Strohmeyers said prior to Jeremy's adoption they told social workers they could not accept a child with a family history of mental illness or retardation. The couple contend they were misled by the county of Los Angeles, specifically in a letter in which the agency characterized the mental illness in Jeremy Strohmeyer's biological mother as a manifestation of drug abuse. That letter came six months after the adoption was approved. The case worker wrote that Jeremy's natural mother "appeared mentally ill." The family's lawyer said that was fraud. "Had the county been forthright and been truthful with the Strohmeyers, they would never have been matched with Jeremy," said attorney Gregory W. Smith.
Agency has 2 weeks to check records
All Los Angeles County's Department of Children and Family Services has said is that back in 1980, when the Strohmeyer's adopted Jeremy, a different agency was responsible. "Since we became a department in 1984, we have always been required to fully disclose to prospective adoptive parents all the information we have on the child and the child's family," said Renee Windsor, deputy director for the Department of Children and Family Services.
The Strohmeyers presented their case to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. The board instructed the county adoption agency to review its policies and report back in two weeks. "The supreme sacrifice has been made of two lovely children, Jeremy and Sherrice," said Winnie Strohmeyer.
The Strohmeyers vowed they'll continue to support their adopted son who will spend the rest of his life behind prison bars.
While confessing to police, Jeremy Strohmeyer said he killed Sharrice because he "wanted to experience death."
During his sentencing hearing, he told the court that had he known earlier about his birth parents he could have sought treatment for addictive tendencies and a possible genetic predisposition toward mental illness.
Strohmeyer, a former high school honor student from Long Beach, California, sexually assaulted and then strangled Sherrice in a women's bathroom stall at the Nevada casino.
The case drew national attention by focusing on the safety of children in casinos and on the revelation that Strohmeyer's friend, David Cash Jr., said he saw the crime in progress but did not stop it.
