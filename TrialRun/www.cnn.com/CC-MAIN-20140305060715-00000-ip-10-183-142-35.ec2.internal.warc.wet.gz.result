Disorders that make sleep scaryStory Highlights 72 percent of us experience some symptoms of a sleep disorder For most people that disorder is insomnia, but other problems can be scary Sleep eating is a condition similar to sleepwalking Sleep paralysis can cause a person to dream while they're awake Next Article in Living » By Ken Carter, Ph.D.	(Mental Floss) -- We spend a third of our lives asleep. And if the number of times you slap the snooze button every morning is any measure, those are some darn good times. Traveling while sleepwalking may be cheaper, but the accomodations aren't always as posh. Of course, sleeping isn't always a pleasant experience. According to the National Sleep Foundation, up to 72 percent of us experience some symptoms of a sleep disorder at least a few nights a week. For most, it's insomnia. For others, the problem is much more unique. 1. Sleep eating Nocturnal Sleep-Related Eating Disorder, or Sleep Eating, is a condition similar to sleepwalking in which affected people will engage in nightly noshing while partially or totally asleep. The most common Sleep Eating episodes entail a person sleepwalking to the refrigerator and munching on a midnight snack that they'll probably never remember. Other times, the episodes are more elaborate, and the fully asleep sufferers head to the kitchen to chop, stir-fry, bake or bust out the George Foreman. In fact, reports indicate that up to one-third of Sleep Eaters have hurt themselves while preparing or eating food (which is actually really low when you think about grillin' up food Emeril-style while unconscious -- bam!).

The disorder is fairly rare, occurring in only about one and a half percent of the population. Two out of three people with Sleep Eating are women, and three out of four eat nightly (some up to eight times a night). Most of them (84 percent) are completely unaware of their nighttime snacks. And ironically, in almost all cases, the behavior doesn't appear to be hunger-related. To make things even more strange, the food choices of Sleep Eaters can be, at times, very peculiar. Case studies have revealed nighttime meals that include cat food, raw chicken, coffee grounds and milk, sandwiches made with fistfuls of salt, and even inedibles such as ammonia or buttered soda cans. 2. Sleep paralysis During normal sleep, your brain sends a signal to your body to inhibit your movement while you're dreaming. This keeps you from thrashing around and possibly hurting yourself. But when Sleep Paralysis occurs, the brain either switches on your muscle inhibition feature too soon or doesn't switch it off when you wake up, which can lead to very creepy experiences. In addition to being unable to move, many people will dream while they're awake -- basically hallucinating. The most common hallucinations that occur with Sleep Paralysis include sensing or seeing another person in the room, being touched, hearing footsteps, floating, or even hearing someone call your name. And for some people, the sensation is so strong they think they've had a stroke and are really paralyzed. Episodes of Sleep Paralysis can last anywhere from 10 seconds to a terrifying 70 minutes. But it could never happen to you, right? Wrong. Studies suggest that about half of us have experienced at least one episode of hypnagogic Sleep Paralysis, the kind that occurs soon after we fall asleep. Chronic Sleep Paralysis, however, only affects about six percent of adults. Generally, the disorder is related to jet lag, sleep deprivation, stress or even your sleeping position. It's believed that supine sleep (sleeping on your back) can make a person five times more likely to have an episode of Sleep Paralysis than any other position. If you do happen to wake one morning and find yourself paralyzed, try wiggling your toes. The paralysis seems to affect larger muscles more than smaller ones, so a good way to get out of it is to try to make small movements. If that doesn't work, check for a crazed Kathy Bates lurching around your room � la "Misery," and make sure your ankles are still intact. 3. Sexsomnia It's embarrassing enough to be told that you snore or mumble in your sleep, but imagine being told that you take off all your clothes, moan in ecstasy, and sometimes even pleasure yourself -- all without any memory of doing so. This is what happens with Sexsomnia. Researchers at the Sleep Disorder Center at Stanford University have classified the sexual behaviors that occur during sleep into three categories. The first involves actions that the researchers describe as "annoying," though not harmful. Cases in this category include sexual moaning loud enough to be heard in adjoining rooms, attempts to remove clothing, and mumbling sexually inappropriate phrases. The second category includes behaviors that are also considered annoying but are, at times, harmful to the person suffering from Sexsomnia. Often, this involves violent masturbation that can cause bruising and soreness the next morning. The last, and most severe, category is for actions that are harmful to others. These cases involve inappropriate and violent sexual behavior. When confronted, people with Sexsomnia have no memory of their actions and become confused and embarrassed. One case study described a man who was so ashamed of his uncontrollable sexual behavior that he refused to share a bed with his wife and would restrain himself during the night to prevent any inappropriate conduct. But even that didn't work. According to the researchers, on one particular evening his Sexsomnia desires were so forceful that he not only broke his restraints, but also two fingers. Most bed partners of those with Sexsomnia find the behavior disquieting and unwelcome. There have even been cases of arrest for sexual battery. Other cases aren't quite as severe, and the episodes of Sexsomnia may be indistinguishable from sex when awake. One woman didn't realize that her husband was suffering from Sexsomnia for months. Finally one night, she clued in when she noticed something different about her husband while they were having sex: he was snoring. Some people think that the diagnosis of Sexsomnia is used to justify inappropriate sexual advances. However, in nearly every case, doctors were able to document abnormal patterns of REM (rapid eye movement) or non-REM sleep, something impossible to fake. The majority of cases also had other psychiatric diagnoses. Fortunately, most patients with Sexsomnia can be successfully treated with psychotropic medications. 4. Pseudoinsomnia We've all had nights where we just couldn't seem to get to sleep. We toss and turn, punch our pillows, count sheep, and wonder what shirt will go best with the dark circles under our eyes the next morning. This is classic insomnia, a condition that an estimated 20 million people experience on a nightly or nearly nightly basis. Strangely, roughly five percent of these insomnia sufferers actually sleep much better than they realize. Why? They don't have insomnia, but instead a condition known as Sleep State Misperception, or Pseudoinsomnia. People with this disorder have vivid dreams about not being able to sleep: tossing and turning and counting those sheep. Consequently, they wake the next morning feeling exhausted and believing they spent the entire night wide awake. Often a bed partner discovers the disorder by assuring their mate that he or she is actually sleeping through the night. Other times, it's diagnosed by a physician, but usually only after prescriptions for typical sleep inducers seem to fail. Luckily, the simple diagnosis of Pseudoinsomnia is usually enough to do the trick in curing the disorder. For more mental_floss articles, visit www.mentalfloss.com.

The most important divorce?Story Highlights Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin faces fallout from actions while governor Claims that she fired Alaskan police chief for not dismissing trooper from his post Trooper Mike Wooten was married to McCain's sister, couple divorced acrimoniously Republicans have gone to court to stop investigation proceedingNext Article in Politics » By Jonathan Mann	(CNN) -- It may not be the ugliest divorce ever in Alaska -- but it could be the most important. And though it was years ago, it could cause Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin some political problems. Up in the American far north and all across the U.S., the Palin domestic drama is known as "Troopergate" because it centers on an Alaska state police officer, Trooper Mike Wooten. Trooper Wooten was married to Palin's younger sister Molly and fathered her two children. The couple broke up three years ago and fought over the youngsters. It was an ugly, angry divorce and the sisters say Wooten threatened murder. "Wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion," the governor complained, "leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someone's life who disagrees with him." Ordinarily, it might be a sad story on the sidelines of Palin's public career -- except that the Palin family wanted Wooten fired and that got ugly too. Don't Miss Special: The Campaign Trail
Special: 2008 Election Center
Special: America votes
The state chief of police said he didn't have enough evidence to dismiss Wooten and says that Palin fired him from his own job as a result. Palin herself acknowledges that some of her aides and even her husband frequently complained about Wooten to his chief. But she says she personally did nothing wrong. She just exercised her legal authority to dismiss the police chief because of differences of opinion. Alaska lawmakers weren't so sure. They ordered an investigation into whether Palin abused her authority. Republicans have gone to court to try to stop the probe but -- barring a last minute surprise -- its report is still expected shortly. It probably won't have any legal repercussions for her, but if it supports the chief of police, the impression could be politically inconvenient. What if it turns out she bullied an honest law-enforcement officer out of his job, to get her way in a domestic dispute that had nothing to do with him? Sarah Palin may be the best thing that ever happened to John McCain's campaign for the presidency. She is the cover-girl of the campaign. But she may be heading back to the front page for a very different reason. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

7 steps to making better decisions By Catherine Price, Oprah.com Instead of torturing yourself with too many choices, the author believes that good enough is often good enough. STORY HIGHLIGHTSDecision making is so emotionally linked that suffering partial brain damage can erase itAuthor: For most people there is no such thing as a purely rational selfEliminate choices by setting standards, but don't worry about finding the "best" RELATED TOPICS
Self-Help
Culture and Lifestyle
(OPRAH.com) -- I felt like punching Benjamin Moore in the face. My husband and I had just moved across the country, and after a flurry of big decisions, we were down to the nitty-gritty: what color to paint our new apartment. The previous tenant had gone with blood red, midnight blue, and tan -- a look I referred to as "depressed Betsy Ross." Hoping to achieve something more cheerful, we sat on the floor surrounded by dozens of paint samples -- Classic Gray or October Sky? Silken Pine or Mystic Beige? -- when all I really wanted was to be able to just flip a switch in my brain and let my rational self determine the perfect choice. It turns out, though, that for most people there is no such thing as a purely rational self. Oprah.com: What's your emotional footprint? Decision making is intrinsically linked to our emotions, so much so that when a person suffers damage to her orbitofrontal cortex -- a part of the brain just behind the eyes that's strongly involved in processing emotions -- she can lose her decision-making ability entirely. (We're talking any decision, like which day to schedule a doctor's appointment or whether to use a blue or black pen.) "If it weren't for our emotions," says science writer Jonah Lehrer, author of "How We Decide," "reason wouldn't exist at all." One way our emotions help us decide is by creating a physical response to information we don't even realize we've noticed. When we slam on the brakes at the sight of an unexpected car, for example, it's because our subconscious mind has recognized danger and translated it into a flash of fear; we decide to act without any conscious thought. Oprah.com: How contagious are your emotions? But our emotions can also lead us astray, as when they encourage us to give a doomed relationship another try or to keep feeding quarters into a slot machine. Since every choice represents a battle between your rational conscious and emotional subconscious minds, the key to good decision making is learning how to pick which side should win. The best decision makers let the situation guide them. The more experience you have with a particular type of decision, the safer it is to go with your intuition, since your subconscious has a wealth of reliable information from which to draw. A professional decorator would have a good instinctive sense of which colors work best for a room, for instance, but if you're a novice like me, it's good to think more analytically. Which is exactly what my husband and I tried to do: After we attempted to gauge our emotional responses to various shades of beige, we began to systematically evaluate how they looked against the door frame. We got nowhere. Oprah.com:Yes? No? Maybe? How to make a decision According to Barry Schwartz, PhD, a psychologist and professor of social theory at Swarthmore College and author of "The Paradox of Choice," we were confronting another challenge common to the modern-day decision maker: too many choices. Anyone who has stood paralyzed in the cereal aisle of the supermarket knows that even if some level of choice is crucial for happiness, too much can feel overwhelming. "We're constantly being told that we can find the best if we try hard enough, and that if we don't, it's our own fault," says Schwartz. "It's a recipe for misery." Too much choice not only makes a decision harder, he continues, but also makes it more likely that we'll regret our selection. To improve our odds of reaching decisions we feel good about, Schwartz suggests figuring out ways to reduce the options to a more manageable number. In the end, my husband and I chose Soft Chamois -- not because it stood out from all the others but because we ran out of time. The painter was scheduled to come the next day. The irony is that, after all our deliberation, it essentially looks white. A gentle, creamy white -- but white nonetheless. There was a time when I would have regretted this and tortured myself wondering if Hot Spring Stones would have looked better. But these days I'm trying instead to live Schwartz's number-one rule of decision making: that good enough is often good enough. Oprah.com: Reinvention strategies: How to follow your gut A handy guide to weighing your options: 1. Identify your goal As David Welch, Ph.D., professor of political science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and author of "Decisions, Decisions: The Art of Effective Decision Making," explains, "People who aren't self-reflective are going to end up making bad decisions because they don't really know what they want in the first place." Before you switch jobs, ask yourself: Do I really want a different career? Or do I just want a different boss? Don't make a decision based on the wrong problem. 2. Eliminate choices by setting standards If you're trying to buy a digital camera, list the features you'll actually use. Any camera that has them is therefore good enough for you; ignore anything fancier. Speaking of which... 3. Don't worry about finding the "best" How good you feel about your decisions is usually more important than how good they are objectively. 4. Be aware of biases They can lead smart people to make dumb decisions. For example: We hate to lose more than we like to win, which can result in behavior such as holding on to a tanking stock instead of accepting a loss. We remember vivid examples better than facts, which is why plane crashes stick in our heads more than statistics on air safety. And we're susceptible to how information is framed -- a "cash discount" is more appealing than "no credit card surcharge." Keeping these biases in mind can help you think clearly. Oprah.com: How to make better decisions as a couple 5. Try not to rush People tend to make poorer choices when they're in a bad mood or under a lot of stress. When facing a complex decision, use your conscious brain to gather the information you need, and then take a break. Go for a walk. Spend a half hour meditating. Take a nap. Have a beer. The idea is to give your unconscious mind some time to do its work. The decision you make afterward is more likely to be the right (or at least a perfectly acceptable) one. 6. Don't sweat the small stuff When possible, eliminate the need for decisions by establishing rules for yourself. You will go to yoga every weekend. You will not have more than two glasses of wine. You will buy whatever toilet paper is on sale. 7. Do a postgame analysis After each decision you make, ask yourself how you felt afterward and what about the experience you can apply in the future.

Aboriginal artists ignore spotty art market By Nuala Calvi, for CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSGeoffrey Bardon was the first white man to recognize the rich cultural heritage of Aboriginal artThe introduction of acrylics and canvas inspired a new level of creativity Aboriginal art began making serious money at auctions in the 1990sMany of the artists still do not have a financial motivation for their work (CNN) -- It's one of the oldest forms of human creativity on the planet, dating back thousands of years -- yet it's only in the last few decades that the art world has really caught on to Aboriginal painting. For generations, Aboriginal elders passed on traditional Dreamtime stories and tribal knowledge through the use of bark, rock and body art, using natural pigments applied in dots and lines with fingers and twigs. It took a humble school teacher in 1970s Papunya, a small settlement in Australia's Western Desert, to become the first white man to recognize this rich cultural heritage. After giving art classes to his young Aboriginal pupils, he encouraged their elders to get involved. "Geoffrey Bardon began encouraging the senior men in the community to paint on whatever they could find -- tiles, bits of board -- so they could record their stories in a more permanent way," said Francesca Cavazzini, an expert at Bonhams Sydney, which is holding an Aboriginal art auction on June 28. "The men embraced it very enthusiastically, and some of those first paintings are still around today and are very collectible," she added. I have to stay within the law when I paint. I can't paint someone else's country or steal their identity.--Aboriginal artist Gunybi Ganambarr

Among them is a work by Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula, featuring desert iconography in enamel paint on chipboard, which will be on sale at the auction. In those early days, many artists simply transferred their traditional paintings and symbolism from bodies and bark onto board. But as government-funded art centers sprang up, giving access to modern materials, the work moved away from dot painting and became more experimental -- incorporating brighter colors and a more painterly form. "A whole new world opened up with the introduction of acrylics and canvas -- the changing of materials let their creativity just really open up," said Adrian Mibus, director of Whitford Fine Art gallery in London, which is currently holding a selling exhibition of Aboriginal art. "In the 1980s, people like Emily Kame Kngwarreye started doing paintings which at the time were a totally new experience -- large finger paintings with swirls of color. She was deemed to be a master." "It's very interesting to see the development when they move to bigger canvases and pare the iconography right down," added Cavazzini. "Often the style is very abstract now, but you'll often see elements of the landscape like sand dunes, done in a beautifully minimalist way." The latter applies to Lily Kelly Napangardi, an artist included in the Whitford exhibition, who paints from the bird's-eye view perspective typical of Aboriginal landscape art. However, senior lawmen in some Aboriginal tribes have been strict about what can and cannot be painted. "I have to stay within the law when I paint. I can't paint someone else's country or steal their identity," explained the Yolngu Aboriginal artist Gunybi Ganambarr. "I make art which shows the law I have learnt from my elders, but I make it a new way that comes from inside. I use things that Yolngu artists haven't used before, like wire and steel and plastic, as well as bark and ochres. These are all things that I find on my land so I can use (them) to paint my land," he added. It wasn't until the 1990s that a secondary market for Aboriginal art developed, but it quickly began to make serious money. "Aboriginal art had never appeared at auction before, and it was incredible to see the reaction to it," said Cavazzini. "Collectors were fighting over it." By the turn of the century it had become a major business, and in some cases art centers were making enough money to become self-sufficient. According to Bonhams, Emily Kame Kngwarreye has achieved AUS$1 million at auction and the market peaked in 2007, before the global financial crisis, with the AUS$2.4 million sale of a work by Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri. More recently, prices have been dropping -- with a Deutscher and Hackett auction in Melbourne this month grossing just AUS$1.25 million from estimates of double or triple that. Yet for many Aboriginal artists, the motivation is not financial. "The current correction in the speculative end of the market is not only of no concern to the artists, they are generally unaware of it," said Will Stubbs, coordinator of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka art center in North East Arnhem Land. "Their concern is with the ceremonial and spiritual health of their land." "For the artists, their motivation to paint is still the same," agreed Sally Clifford, director of Warlayirti Artists Aboriginal Corporation in Balgo. "Despite the economic climate, they are still wanting to share their Tjukurrpa (dreaming story) to people all over the world."CNN's Greg Hughes contributed to this article.

Cyborg anthropologist: We can all be superhuman
By Amber Case, Special to CNN
updated 12:07 PM EST, Wed December 5, 2012 | STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Amber Case is the Director of the Esri R&D Center and a cyborg anthropologist
Cyborg anthropology is the study of the interaction between humans and technology
"A cyborg is simply someone who interacts with technology," says Case
Case: "Technology won't propagate until it fulfills a social need"
Editor's note: Amber Case is the Director of the Esri R&D Center, Portland, a company which aims to understand our world and "unleash the power of location." She was formerly the CEO of geolocation platform creator Geoloqi, Inc., acquired by Esri in Oct 2012.As a student of cyborg anthropology, Case studies the symbiotic interactions between humans and technology.
(CNN) -- What exactly is cyborg anthropology?
Cyborg anthropology is the study of the interaction between humans and technology, and how technology affects culture. Mobile technology allows one to stand almost anywhere in the world, whisper something, and be heard elsewhere. These devices that live in our pockets need to be fed every night require our frequent attention. In only a few years these devices have become stitched into the fabric of our everyday lives. Phones offer us respite from the boredom of waiting in lines, but they also inhibit us when they run out of batteries.
Everyone that uses technology is a superhuman.Amber Case
I'm fascinated with mobile devices for another reason -- they are a bundle of sensors that we walk around with every day. That sensor data can be used to do very interesting things, such as automatically turn on the lights in your house when you get home, or turn the lights off when you leave.
In traditional anthropology, somebody goes to another country, says: "How fascinating these people are! How interesting their tools and their culture are," and then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think these cultures are very exotic. cyborg anthropologists step back from the modern world and look at the everyday life and how the people around us are influenced by technology in everyday life.
Why did you decide to study cyborg anthropology?
When I was little, I was very interested in technology, science and mathematics. I grew up in the '80s, but read my dad's copy of 1960 World Book Encyclopedia. My favorite entry was on the modern computer. The machine filled an entire gymnasium and was used for military and business. As I grew up, I saw technology transition towards being used in everyday life. The only problem was that technology was still a pain in the neck to use. Most systems had too many menus and buttons.
A cyborg is not Terminator or Robocop, but the experience of everyday life that's been altered by technology.Amber Case
During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to the field of cyborg anthropology -- the study of humanity and technology. What I really liked about cyborg anthropology is that it crossed multiple fields of study. In academia, you can learn a lot about a certain field, but know nothing about another. Technology is so intertwined with humanity at this point that it takes multiple fields to understand both tools and people.
Explainer interactive: What is the 'Internet of Things'?
How would you define your cyborg self?
A cyborg is simply someone who interacts with technology. The technology can be a physical or a mental extension, and doesn't need to be implanted in the person. The origin of the word cyborg was from a 1960 paper on space travel, where it was used to describe the placement of external devices and clothing on a human to make them fit for space travel.
For thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self. And because of that, we're able to travel faster and communicate differently through the use of technology.
A cyborg is not Terminator or Robocop, but the experience of everyday life that's been altered by technology. Everyone that uses technology is a superhuman. It's not so strange anymore because it's the norm -- most everyone else around us is also a superhuman. The only time we notice it is when our devices run out of power. We're all super humans until our devices lose energy.

You talk about a new form of "human connection," can you explain this to us?
60-second pitch: Whyd
Could robots take over Earth?
A vehicle is a physical transportation device, but there are limits to how small it can be made. A computer is a mental transportation device, but it need not be limited by its size and shape. We can put anything we want into computers and phones, and they don't get heavier because that information is invisible and weighs nothing, or is stored elsewhere, and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like? If you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time.
When you use a social network, your sense of self extends into that virtual space. Getting a "Like" on Facebook or a comment on a status is a dopamine hit the equivalent of getting a hug. This isn't really a new form of communication, but a new way of connecting.

Can you tell us about some projects you're working on?
I've always inspired by the technology built by Mark Weiser at Xerox Parc in the '70s, especially ubiquitous and calm computing. My projects have always been about using data in new ways, the future of the interface and the button, and the future of location.
What we need is a common language that allows all of these devices to communicate with one another.Amber Case
For instance, you should always be able to get information based on when you need it. Location plays a big role in that. Right now, data is stuck on the web, not where you are. When you land at the airport, you often have to look through your email to get to the information you need in order to get to your destination. It should already be there on your phone.
There is a lot of talk that we're finally entering into an era of the "Internet of Things." The exciting part is that we have all of these devices now that are sensors for reality -- sound, noise, temperature, images, location, air quality and so on. We can wear trackers to count our steps or measure our weight, and we can use tech to make a picture of where we've been. All of this data is interesting by itself, but all of the devices speak different languages. Devices made by different companies use different protocols. Some are open; others are closed. It's a modern day Tower of Babel.
Taking data from across many different silos is where the opportunity is. If I knew my mood, hunger level, and location at a given time of the day, I could figure out if my mood caused me to want to eat, or if I was unhappy at work and needed a different job. I could correlate amount of sleep with weight gain, and so on. What we need is a common language that allows all of these devices to communicate with one another. We saw this with SMS (allowing different phones to talk to each other across networks), SMTP/POP that allowed for modern email to exist (because it allowed modern email accounts to talk to each other across networks), and Interpress (allowing the modern printer industry to form.) That hasn't been solved for devices.
Once we get a lot of data onto maps, we can really begin to understand reality in much different ways, like where to build a house to increase the happiness of the people inside it, how to make routes that avoid accidents, and how to design better urban systems. I'm really excited about platform that Esri provides. We'll be integrating the Geoloqi location technology into the Esri platform in July 2013 and will be able to open up an entire world of datasets and solutions accessible before only by geographers, scientists and researchers.

Survivors mark 1-year anniversary of Costa Concordia disaster
By Barbie Latza Nadeau, For CNN
updated 5:49 AM EST, Mon January 14, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: In a television interview, the ship's captain says he was not responsible for the wreck
Family members and survivors mark the anniversary with a somber memorial
The Costa Concordia ran aground off Italian island last year, killing 32 people
Several hundred passengers are in Giglio to commemorate the anniversary
Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- A boat's horn bellowed 32 times off the coast of Italy on Sunday, honoring each of the victims who died a year ago when a luxury cruise liner ran aground.
Family members of those who perished tossed wreaths, lilies and notes into icy waters at a ceremony marking the anniversary of the Costa Concordia crash. And a large boulder bearing a plaque with victims' names was lowered into the same sea that claimed their lives.
The somber memorial was a sharp contrast to the chaos of a year ago, when the massive ship ran aground with 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members on board.
According to passengers' accounts, pandemonium erupted as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard; remaining members seemed helpless to handle the melee.
Dan Rivers: "Although there is no permanent memorial to the tragedy on Giglio, many islanders are reminded about the disaster every time they look out of their window and see the wreck."

Workers stand on the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship off the Italian island of Giglio on Sunday, January 13, during commemorations marking the first anniversary of the cruise liner disaster. Survivors, grieving relatives and locals on the island of Giglio gathered to remember the 32 people who were lost.
On January 13, 2012, the cruise ship Costa Concordia crashed into a bed of rocks near the port on the Italian island of Giglio, taking 32 lives. Although the ship owner announced that efforts to move the cruise liner would begin in May, the ship carcass still lies halfway submerged a year later. Relatives hold bouquets of flowers before throwing them into the sea on Sunday during commemorations.

Remembering the Costa Concordia
2012: Costa Concordia captain in court
The night of the accident, many survivors sought shelter in churches and other buildings on the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio.
At one of the churches on Sunday, many survivors and family members of victims gathered for a two-hour Mass to remember the victims and honor divers and rescue workers.
"I came to pray for my colleagues and the passengers who lost their lives," said Santosh Velhal, a Costa Concordia crew member from Mumbai who worked in the ship's security department.
The children of Gerald and Barbara Heil -- an American couple from Minnesota who died in the accident -- were also among those who traveled to Italy for Sunday's ceremony.
The day's events also included the dedication of a plaque with the victims' names on a wall in Giglio's harbor and a violin concert held in a local church. At 9:45 p.m., the exact one-year anniversary of the moment of impact, survivors planned to light 32 lanterns -- one for each of the victims.
Meanwhile, the Costa Concordia, now a half-submerged carcass, still sits in the harbor where it ran aground. Hundreds of people are working 24-7 to secure it, but salvage efforts are taking longer than expected. Officials now hope to have the ship upright by late June or early July and to tow it to some port by September.
During Sunday's ceremony, the skies were overcast and a fierce wind blew.
The seas were rough, and the waves washed up against the wreckage and salvage barges with such force that crews had to reinforce their equipment.
"Thank God the weather wasn't like this last year," Karin Fogazzi told reporters as she stared at the wreckage.
The weather was more temperate last year, when she and her husband Roberto escaped the ship carrying their 10-month-old son Daniel down a rope ladder.
The family came on Sunday to mark the occasion, she said, and to try to help deal with the post-traumatic stress disorder they've been battling over the past year.
The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship. Other crew members and Concordia executives also could face trial.
Schettino has said that managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area.
In an interview with Italy's "Domenica In" television show on Sunday, Schettino blamed the ship's helmsman for misunderstanding orders to avoid the rocks. The captain said he'd felt pain over the victims' deaths every day for the past year.
The day was a somber reminder of the lives lost in the shipwreck, but it was also important for the 900 residents of Giglio to commemorate an event that changed their island forever.
"This is not a celebration," Mayor Sergio Ortelli said. "This year has been dramatic for the people of this island who have had their whole lives turned upside down by this event. We hope our island returns to a place of tranquility once the steel monster out there is towed away."
CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Christmas Fast Facts
By CNN Library
updated 1:29 PM EST, Tue December 24, 2013
(CNN) -- Here's a look at what you need to know about Christmas, a popular Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. In 2013, December 25th falls on a Wednesday.
Facts:
Celebrated December 25th in the United States and other countries.
Christmas is celebrated on January 7 in some Eastern Orthodox countries, such as Russia.
The real date of Jesus' birth is not known.
The Christmas story is told primarily in the Gospels of Saint Luke and Saint Matthew in the New Testament.
Considered the most popular Christian observance, Christmas is also celebrated as a secular family holiday.
The word Christmas is derived from the Old English phrase Cristes maesse (Christ's mass).
The tradition of substituting X-mas for Christmas has its origins in the early Christian church. The first letter of Jesus Christ's name is X in the Greek language.
Many of the customs and symbols traditionally associated with Christmas originated with ancient pagan festivals and winter solstice rituals.
The modern Christmas tree (typically evergreen conifers-usually pine, balsam or fir species) originated in Germany in the 16th century and became popular in England by the mid-19th century thanks to Queen Victoria's German husband, Prince Albert.
St. Nicholas, the real person on whom Santa Claus is based, lived in the 4th century AD in the province of Lycia on the southwest coast of Asia Minor.
Cartoonist Thomas Nast is credited with creating the current image of Santa Claus based on his illustrations that began appearing in Harpers Weekly in 1863.
Economic Impact:
Sales during the holiday season may comprise 25-40% of a retailer's annual sales. (National Retail Federation)
Expected holiday spending for November and December 2013 is $602.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation, an increase of 3.9% over 2012.
December 18 and December 19 are expected to be the busiest days for mail and package deliveries respectively, according to the United States Post Office.

(CNN) -- Bread served hot out of the oven. Fluffy pancakes topped with huckleberries. An espresso bar. These are the kinds of hotel breakfasts that keep guests from venturing out to a nearby restaurant.
The following properties want each element of your stay to be unforgettable, starting with the first decadent bite of the day. Each of the following breakfasts is included in the nightly rate, so go ahead -- indulge in that second still-warm croissant.
Bespoke Inn, Cafe & Bicycles, Scottsdale, Arizona
The four-room boutique Bespoke Inn, Cafe & Bicycles offers a three-course breakfast full of indulgences for every palate. If you have a sweet tooth, try items such as ginger scones with fresh peaches drizzled in local honey or vanilla French toast with toasted almonds, berries, and real maple syrup.
For those that prefer a savory start to the morning, tuck into a croque madame with black forest ham and gruyere or asparagus topped with poached eggs, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and parmesan. These breakfasts will set you up for a day of exploring Scottsdale on complimentary Pashley bikes. Starting nightly rate: $259.
The New Hotel, Athens
Countless affordable restaurants with a tasty breakfast fill the capital city of Greece, but the flaky croissants at New Taste -- the ground-floor restaurant in the New Hotel -- are irresistible. Pastries are baked fresh in-house every morning, filling the restaurant with that just-out-of-the-oven aroma.
The bread and pastries are served alongside a refined buffet of fresh fruit, cheeses and meats, along with eggs cooked to order and an espresso bar ready to whip up your favorite morning coffee. Starting nightly rate: About $240 (€180).
Mandarin Oriental, Boston
A decadent breakfast with a sense of place often means one thing in New England: lobster. Breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental in Boston features a lobster omelet with big chunks of lobster, boursin cheese, asparagus, caramelized onions and breakfast potatoes on the side.
Guests looking for an upgrade on a classic should check out the hotel's gourmand version of bacon and eggs with poached eggs, grilled glazed thick cut bacon piled on top of grilled sourdough bread with roasted tomato, arugula and smoked pimenton hollandaise. Starting nightly bed and breakfast rate: $539.
Number 31, Dublin, Ireland
The best breakfasts showcase an authentic taste of your destination. At a boutique guesthouse in central Dublin, traditional Irish brown bread is pulled from the oven each morning, forming the foundation of a distinctly Irish breakfast.
This crumbly bread is a fragrant and hearty accompaniment to smoked salmon and scrambled eggs or a modern execution of a full Irish breakfast, among other cooked-to-order choices.
While awaiting your order, nibble on cranberry and nut cake, vanilla poached pears or mixed berries. Each component of this breakfast is exquisite and served by warm Irish hosts. Starting nightly rate: About $200 (€150).
The Resort at Paws Up, Montana
Fresh Montana air brightens each bite of breakfast at the Resort at Paws Up. Choose accommodations in the luxurious Cliffside Camp overlooking the Blackfoot River and watch a private camp chef pick huckleberries from the surrounding slopes to create fluffy huckleberry pancakes and other memorable dishes.
Linger over freshly brewed coffee and maple glazed bacon for an impressive breakfast in the Montana wilderness. Starting nightly Cliffside Camp rate: $1475, including all meals.
The Torridon, Scotland
Indulgence varies according to destination, and in Scotland, it translates to a full Scottish breakfast with maybe a wee dram of whiskey on the side. This loch-side luxury property sets the table for a leisurely breakfast of free-range highland eggs, potato scones, Cumberland sausages, highland back bacon, grilled tomatoes and more.
Wood-smoked salmon with scrambled eggs and homemade toasted brioche is also a highlight. Travelers looking for the pleasures of natural Scotland will find them at this inn. Bed and breakfast starting nightly rate: About $360 (£230).
Saxon Boutique Hotel, Villas and Spa, Johannesburg, South Africa
What could be a more decadent start to the day than oysters and champagne? That is how executive chef David Higg likes to start his favorite meal of the day.
The continental breakfast also includes smoked Scottish salmon, mini quiches, fresh fruit and scones. For those that might prefer a cooked-to-order breakfast with their complimentary champagne, eggs benedict with Parma ham or French toast with camembert cheese and crispy bacon are also available. Starting nightly rate: About $828 (ZAR8170)
Twin Farms, Barnard, Vermont
Surrounded by 300 acres of meadows in Vermont, Twin Farms makes an impression with its breakfast as well as its location. Many guests return raving about the lemon soufflé pancakes, served with Vermont strawberries.
These light-as-air pancakes are a perfect accompaniment to fragrant Kona coffee, a nod to the owners' Hawaiian roots. This all-inclusive Relais & Chateaux property also offers fresh pastries served with jam made from berries picked on site. All-inclusive starting nightly rate: $1450, including all meals, alcoholic beverages, use of facilities and gratuities.
