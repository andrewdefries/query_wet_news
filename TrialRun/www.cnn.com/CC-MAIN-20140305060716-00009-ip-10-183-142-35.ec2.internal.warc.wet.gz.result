Text of memorandum submitted by France, Russia, Germany
Story Tools
(CNN) -- France, Russia and Germany submitted a memorandum to the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) on Monday that was meant to counter a proposed resolution backed by the United States, Britain and Spain that would declare that Iraq has missed its last chance to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction. The following is the text of that memorandum:
1. Full and effective disarmament in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions remains the imperative objective of the international community. Our priority should be to achieve this peacefully through the inspection regime. The military option should only be a last resort. So far, the conditions for using force against Iraq are not fulfilled:
• While suspicions remain, no evidence has been given that Iraq still possesses weapons of mass destruction or capabilities in this field;
• Inspections have just reached their full pace; they are functioning without hindrance; they have already produced results;
• While not yet fully satisfactory, Iraqi co-operation is improving, as mentioned by the chief inspectors in their last report.
2. The Security Council must step up its efforts to give a real chance to the peaceful settlement of the crisis. In this context, the following conditions are of paramount importance:
• The unity of the Security Council must be preserved;
• The pressure that is put on Iraq must be increased.
3. These conditions can be met, and our common objective -- the verifiable disarmament of Iraq -- can be reached through the implementation of the following proposals:
A) Clear program of action for the inspections:
According to resolution 1284, UNMOVIC [the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] and IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] have to submit their program of work for approval of the Council. The presentation of this program of work should be speeded up, in particular the key remaining disarmament tasks to be completed by Iraq pursuant to its obligations to comply with the disarmament requirements of resolution 687 [of 1991] and other related resolutions.
The key remaining tasks shall be defined according to their degree of priority. What is required of Iraq for implementation of each task shall be clearly defined and precise.
Such a clear identification of tasks to be completed will oblige Iraq to cooperate more actively. It will also provide a clear means for the Council to assess the co-operation of Iraq.
B) Reinforced inspections:
Resolution 1441 established an intrusive and reinforced system of inspections. In this regard, all possibilities have not yet been explored. Further measures to strengthen inspections could include, as exemplified in the French non paper previously communicated to the chief inspectors, the following: increase and diversification of staff and expertise; establishment of mobile units designed in particular to check on trucks; completion of the new system of aerial surveillance; systematic processing of data provided by the newly established system of aerial surveillance.
C) Timelines for inspections and assessment:
Within the framework of resolutions 1284 and 1441, the implementation of the program of work shall be sequenced according to a realistic and rigorous timeline:
• The inspectors should be asked to submit the program of work outlining the key substantive tasks for Iraq to accomplish, including missiles/delivery systems, chemical weapons/precursors, biological weapons/material and nuclear weapons in the context of the report due March 1st;
• The chief inspectors shall report the Council on implementation of the program of work on a regular basis (every 3 weeks);
• A report of UNMOVIC and IAEA assessing the progress made in completing the tasks shall be submitted by the inspectors 120 days after the adoption of the program of work according to resolution 1284;
• At any time, according to paragraph 11 of resolution 1441, the executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director General of the IAEA shall report immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspections activities as well as failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations;
• At any time, additional meetings of the Security Council could be decided, including at high level.
To render possible a peaceful solution inspections should be given the necessary time and resources. However, they cannot continue indefinitely. Iraq must disarm. Its full and active co-operation is necessary. This must include the provision of all the additional and specific information on issues raised by the inspectors as well as compliance with their requests, as expressed in particular in [chief inspector Hans] Blix's letter of February 21st 2003. The combination of a clear program of action, reinforced inspections, a clear timeline and the military build-up provide a realistic means to reunite the Security Council and to exert maximum pressure on Iraq.

Source: FBI investigating Indymac for fraudStory Highlights The California-based bank was taken over by federal regulators last week Indymac's collapse was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history Source: FBI investigation is focused primarily on the company, not individuals Next Article in U.S. » Read TIMELINE From Kelli Arena CNN Justice Department correspondent WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI is investigating Indymac Bancorp for fraud, a source tells CNN. The California-based bank was taken over by federal regulators last week. Indymac's collapse was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. A source said the federal government is looking into whether the bank engaged in fraud when it made home loans to high-risk borrowers. The source said the investigation is focused primarily on the company, not individuals. Meanwhile, Josh Hochberg, the former head of the U.S. Justice Department's fraud section, said that any investigation of Indymac would probably look into whether the bank used false information to give loans to people who wouldn't have otherwise been eligible. "I would suspect they are looking at bad appraisals, bad underwriting, which would mean false statements on loan applications, some of which require federal forms to be filled out -- so they can be prosecuted for the false statements," he said. "I would also suspect they would look at false statements to the investing community for securities fraud violations." In a written statement, the FBI didn't specifically comment on Indymac but noted that it is investigating 21 corporations in the subprime lending market for possible mortgage fraud. "We receive information from a variety of sources on a daily basis, and we have an obligation to review each allegation on its own merits," the statement said. "Given the volatility of today's subprime market, we have seen an increase in subprime related complaints." Don't Miss How Fannie, Freddie and Indymac affect you
Indymac to reopen 'strong and safe,' new boss says
The statement said that in order to protect the integrity of its investigations, the bureau does not comment about or confirm specific companies that may be under scrutiny. Friday's closure of IndyMac bank sparked investor panic that sent shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a wild ride and fueled speculation of a government rescue. See a timeline of other banks that have failed » IndyMac, which reopened Monday under federal supervision, was once one of the nation's largest home lenders. Thanks in part to the nation's mortgage crisis, it lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year and in 2007, and concerns about the bank led customers to withdraw $1.3 billion in the last two weeks, prompting the government takeover. On Sunday, the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced steps to make funds available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if necessary. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created to help individuals realize the American dream of home ownership, but they now find their survival at risk in the U.S. mortgage crisis. About 95 percent of the $19 billion in deposits in Indymac bank are insured, but that leaves $1 billion that was not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees, according to CNNMoney. According to the FDIC, 10,000 IndyMac customers could lose as much as half of that amount, or $500 million. The agency says the failure will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund between $4 billion and $8 billion, based on preliminary estimates. "This will certainly be a costly failure. Whether it's the costliest, we just don't know at this point," FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair said late Friday night. The failure of Indymac could also affect premiums paid by all banks for deposit insurance, she added. IndyMac grew rapidly during the real estate and home building boom. Its specialty was so-called Alt-A loans, those for which home buyers were asked to produce little or no evidence of income or assets other than the house they were buying.

People posing, and talking, as their pets on FacebookBy Stephanie Goldberg, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media Kirsty Worrall created a Facebook account for her cat to keep friends and family up to date on Shiva's progress. STORY HIGHLIGHTSThousands violate Facebook's terms by posing as their pet on the social network"Facebook doesn't allow fake profiles for pets," a spokesperson for site saysSome pet owners say social networks can be helpful when caring for animalsAssuming false ID on Facebook "hurts the quality of communication," blogger says

(CNN) -- There's nothing too unusual about the way Shiva Lingham starts her day. After a quick breakfast, she goes upstairs and crawls into her mom's unmade bed. An hour or so later, a well-rested Shiva visits the family laptop to log on to Facebook and update her status. Only Shiva can't use the laptop alone -- she doesn't have opposable thumbs. But then, most cats don't. Shiva's owner, self-proclaimed "crazy cat lady" Kirsty Worrall, created Shiva's Facebook account in September to keep her friends and family up to date on the kitten's progress. "Everybody seemed to be more interested in the cat than what me or my partner were doing," said Worrall, who doesn't have her own Facebook account. "I come from a family of huge cat lovers. They're fascinated with Shiva ... and they've been able to watch her grow through the Facebook page." Worrall keeps Shiva's Facebook friends in the loop by posting photos of Shiva and updating her status in the third person to reflect what she's doing at that point in time. One recent status update reads: "Shiva Lingham is very upset that Mummy and Daddy have only been eating vegetarian food! ... Where's the Beef!" Although exact numbers are hard to come by, Worrall is one of a growing number of pet owners who pose as their animals on social networks. A quick scan of Facebook yields at least a few thousand profile pages for dogs and cats along with less common pets such as birds, hamsters, ferrets, turtles, fish and rabbits. Many of the profiles feature status updates from the animal's perspective, like this one posted by parrot Fruit Loop: "Fankyou everyone muchly for my wonderful Birthday msgs. Mumma ran out of Internet so I couldn't thankyou sooner.. My mumma made me some birdie muffins, yum yum. And I got a new toy! STOKED." Or this update by a rabbit named Nestle: "Eat, poop, groom, sleep, repeat!!!" These pet owners say it's all in good fun. But some may not realize they are violating Facebook's terms and conditions. "People on Facebook want to interact with their real friends and the people they know in the real world," Facebook spokesperson Winnie Ko wrote in an e-mail to CNN. "Since accounts that impersonate anyone or anything can damage the integrity of this environment, Facebook doesn't allow fake profiles for pets." Justin Smith, founder of the blog Inside Facebook, says it's not so much about the pets but the practice of assuming a false identity that "hurts the quality of communication" on the popular site, which has more than 500 million users. "There are many places online where people assume identities of either people or, in some cases, pets. ... It's something we've seen with a lot of the first-generation social networks on the web," Smith said. Instead of joining Facebook, pet owners might consider joining a social network specifically for pets, he said. Among them are Critterscorner.ning.com, Catster.com, Dogster.com and myDogspace.com. There's even one for rabbits: BunSpace. Jessica Frey, who operates a Facebook page on behalf of her rabbit Nestle, is aware of pet-centric networking sites such as BunSpace. But she says it's hard to make the switch after investing so much time in one social network and notes that Nestle has more than 1,000 friends on Facebook -- most of them furry. Frey says some of Nestle's rabbit friends have had their accounts shut down by the site. "It's really silly because we all know it's really not the pets that are doing it," she said. "It's the people behind them that are making friends with other people. It's pretty harmless." Facebook did not respond to a question about whether the site removes pets' profile pages. Nestle's Facebook page has enabled Frey to make friends with pet owners from around the world, she says. Her children's friends have all added Nestle as a friend on Facebook. One person, however, remains immune to Nestle's social-networking charms. "My fiance thinks I'm crazy," she said. "He doesn't like it at all. Every once in a while, I'll have Nestle say something to him on Facebook, and he'll just delete it." Frey believes that for uncommon house pets, Facebook can be a lifesaver -- literally. When Nestle began suffering from gastrointestinal stasis, a potentially fatal condition, Frey turned to her social network for help because "a lot of vets don't know too much about rabbits." One Facebook friend answered her query, suggesting she medicate Nestle with gas-relief drops for infants. The bunny has been in good health ever since. Worrall, who lives in Birmingham, England, agrees that Facebook can be a helpful tool. But she's much more interested in making new friends for Shiva. Possibly even a boyfriend. "[Shiva's] got a lot of cat friends in America, but, at the moment, she's still looking for a kitty friend in the U.K.," Worrall said. "She tried to get herself a transatlantic kitty boyfriend, but he was already taken ... she couldn't tempt him away," she said with a laugh. There's nothing wrong with giving your pet a voice, says Mike Pena and Anton Shepherd, co-founders of Petzume, a social networking site for pets and pet owners. Both at one point or another have spoken for their pets online, they say. "We see a lot of people who create profiles for their pets ... and talk through the character of their pet to describe the day's activities, [their] likes and dislikes," Pena said. Pena says it can be funny to explain, from the pet's perspective, why he or she chewed up your favorite hat. He speaks from experience. Mary Lou Randour, a psychologist with the Humane Society of the United States, has no problem with people creating online profiles for pets. "It probably feels like by doing this, that you're honoring your pet," she says. "You can have other people meet your pet and get to know them like you would with other members of the family. You can share the pet's personality as you experience it." "Sometimes with other social networks, people feel pressure. They want to try and have important updates and make sure their image is protected," Shepherd said. "But with a pet social network, you don't have to worry about that. You can just be yourself." Worrall, however, is perfectly comfortable being herself as Shiva on a broader network like Facebook. In fact, she prefers it. Worrall enjoys interacting through Shiva's profile with friends and family -- and, she says, with "other crazy cat ladies just like me." Share this on:

Apple: School should center on the iPad
By John D. Sutter, CNN
updated 3:23 PM EST, Wed January 25, 2012 | Filed under: Mobile
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Apple announces digital textbook publishing app
The free app is called iBook Author
The company says anyone can make a digital textbook in five minutes
Moves are part of Apple's larger strategy to remake the textbook industry
(CNN) -- Apple on Thursday lifted the veil on its plans to remake the educational landscape in a way that centers on its best-selling tablet computer, the iPad.
"Education is deep in Apple's DNA and iPad may be our most exciting education product yet," Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, said in a statement.
At a press conference in New York, the company announced three products that aim to get students and teachers to use the iPad's touch-screen interface to read, write, plan classes and communicate with each other.
First, a free app called iBooks Author lets anyone create a digital, interactive textbook.
In a demo at the event, an Apple employee created an e-book with the app in about five minutes, according to live blogs.

Second, an update to a piece of software called iTunes U lets teachers plan their curriculum and communicate with their students over the iPad.
The new iTunes U, which also is free and available on Thursday, will "allow anyone, anywhere, at any time to take courses for free," Schiller said, according to Fortune.com's Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who was live blogging from the event. Fortune is a partner site of CNN.com.
"If you're an educator at a university, college, or K-12 school, now you have an easy way to design and distribute complete courses featuring audio, video, books, and other content," Apple's website said Thursday. "And students and lifelong learners can experience your courses for free through a powerful new app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch."
Finally, a new textbook store called iBooks 2, also a free app, will feature digital e-books for schools.
Apple said it is partnering with several major textbook companies -- including Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who will make e-books for the store, according to Fortune.
High school textbooks will cost up to $14.99, the company said.
In another demo, Apple's Roger Rosner showed off textbooks for the iPad that allow students to zoom in on pictures of cells, dissect digital frogs and make notes and highlights on the e-book pages.
"I don't think there's ever been a textbook that made it this easy to be a good student," Rosner said, according to Fortune.
All of these moves are part of Apple's larger strategy to remake the textbook industry. The company reportedly has been courting schools to make use of its popular tablet computer.
At the press conference, Schiller mocked paper textbooks, saying, "They're not portable, not durable, not interactive, not searchable." Books on the iPad are all of those things, he said, according to live blogs covering the event.
Some educators seem to be excited about the changes.
"Apple has recognized that learning for students is not a one-way street," Jed Macosko, an associate professor at Wake Forest University, said in a statement.
"Until now, most traditional e-textbooks have focused on linear content delivery, which is not the way people learn. Research shows that we learn by asking questions," said Macosko, the author of an interactive biology textbook.
Others questioned whether the move could give Apple too much control over educational content.
"(It's) not clear so far whether Apple's new textbooks will be open formats (ePub etc.) or only in Apple format," Mathew Ingram, a senior writer for the blog GigaOm, posted on Twitter after the event.
Or they mocked the fact that Apple is trying to take such a big role in education.
"For a small upcharge, Apple will put a huge logo on your school and tattoo an Apple on each (student's) forearm," user @irasocol wrote on Twitter.

This image was captured in 1976 by Viking 2, one of two probes sent to investigate the surface of Mars for the first time. NASA's Viking landers blazed the trail for future missions to Mars.
The Valles Marineris rift system on Mars is 10 times longer, five times deeper and 20 times wider than the Grand Canyon. This composite image was made from NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft, which launched in 2001.
The Nili Fossae region of Mars is one of the largest exposures of clay minerals discovered by the OMEGA spectrometer on Mars Express Orbiter. This image was taken in 2007 as part of a campaign to examine more than two dozen potential landing sites for NASA's new Mars rover, Curiosity, also known as the NASA Mars Science Laboratory.
NASA's Mars Phoenix Lander descends to the surface of Mars in May 2008. Fewer than half of the Mars missions have made successful landings.
Phoenix's robotic arm scoops up a sample on June 10, 2008, the 16th Martian day after landing. The lander's solar panel is seen in the lower left.
In 2006, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit captured a 360-degree view known as the McMurdo panorama. The images were taken at the time of year when Mars is farthest from the sun and dust storms are less frequent.
The European Space Agency's Mars Express captured this view of Valles Marineris in 2004. The area shows mesas and cliffs as well as features that indicate erosion from flowing water.
This view is a vertical projection that combines more than 500 exposures taken by Phoenix in 2008. The black circle on the spacecraft is where the camera itself is mounted.
A portion of the west rim of the Endeavour Crater sweeps southward in this view from NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity in 2011. The crater is 22 kilometers (13.7 miles) across.
A photo captured by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor in 2000 offers evidence that the planet may have been a land of lakes in its earliest period, with layers of Earth-like sedimentary rock that could harbor the fossils of any ancient Martian life.
A U.S. flag and a DVD containing a message for future explorers of Mars, science fiction stories and art about the planet, and the names of 250,000 people sit on the deck of Phoenix in 2008.
A rock outcrop dubbed Longhorn and the sweeping plains of the Gusev Crater are seen in a 2004 image taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit.
Although it is 45 kilometers (28 miles) wide, countless layers of ice and dust have all but buried the Udzha Crater on Mars. The crater lies near the edge of the northern polar cap. This image was taken by NASA's Mars Odyssey Orbiter in 2010.
NASA's Opportunity examines rocks inside an alcove called Duck Bay in the western portion of the Victoria Crater in 2007.
Pictured is a series of troughs and layered mesas in the Gorgonum Chaos region of Mars in 2008. This photo was taken by Mars Orbiter Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor.
An image captured in 2008 by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows at least four Martian avalanches, or debris falls, taking place. Material, likely including fine-grained ice and dust and possibly large blocks, detached from a towering cliff and cascaded to the gentler slopes below.
This 2008 image spans the floor of Ius Chasma's southern trench in the western region of Valles Marineris, the solar system's largest canyon. Ius Chasma is believed to have been shaped by a process called sapping, in which water seeped from the layers of the cliffs and evaporated before it reached the canyon floor. Pictured is the Martian landscape at Meridiani Planum, where the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity successfully landed in 2004. This is one of the first images beamed back to Earth from the rover shortly after it touched down.
An image from the Mars Global Surveyor in 2000 shows potential evidence of massive sedimentary deposits in the western Arabia Terra impact crater on the surface of Mars.
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captures a dust devil blowing across the Martian surface east of the Hellas impact basin in 2007. Dust devils form when the temperature of the atmosphere near the ground is much warmer than that above. The diameter of this dust devil is about 200 meters (650 feet).
Soft soil is exposed when the wheels of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit dig into a patch of ground dubbed Troy in 2009.
An image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows the floor of the Antoniadi Crater in 2009.
The larger of Mars' two moons, Phobos, is seen in 2008 from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
Earth and the moon are seen in 2007 from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. At the time the image was taken, Earth was 142 million kilometers (88 million miles) from Mars.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NASA has sent four rovers to Mars so far, dating back to 1997
NASA's budget for Mars exploration is slated to decrease, however
The near future could be akin to the '80s when there were no Mars missions, official says
Europe is planning to launch the first part of the ExoMars mission for 2016
(CNN) -- The much-celebrated Mars rover Curiosity is headed for Mount Sharp, where it will help scientists explore the question of life on Mars as it climbs up and up.
Meanwhile, however, NASA's budget for planetary exploration is slated to go down, down, down.
Scientists are basking in the success of Curiosity's stunning landing on August 6, proving that a complicated system involving a parachute and a sky crane can safely deliver a 2,000-pound vehicle to Mars. The $2.6 billion Curiosity will spend years roaming the planet, snapping photos and gathering scientific data.
NASA: 'Impressive' Curiosity landing only 1.5 miles off
This view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon, taken by NASA's Mars rover Curiosity, includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky. Earth is a little left of center in the image, and our moon is just below Earth. A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright "evening stars."
This mosaic of images from the Navigation Camera (Navcam) on Curiosity shows the terrain to the west from the rover's position on the 528th Martian day, or sol, of the mission on January 30. The images were taken right after Curiosity had arrived at the eastern edge of a location called "Dingo Gap." A dune across the gap is about 3 feet high in the middle and tapered at south and north ends onto low scarps on either side of the gap. The rover team is evaluating possible driving routes on the other side before a decision whether to cross the gap. The view covers a panorama from south, at the left edge, to north-northwest at the right edge. It is presented as a cylindrical projection.
An illustration depicts the possible extent of an ancient lake inside Gale Crater, where the Mars rover Curiosity landed on the Red Planet in August 2012. The $2.5 billion NASA mission set out to explore Gale Crater, which was thought to have once hosted flowing water. Curiosity found evidence of clay formations, or "mudstone," in the crater's Yellowknife Bay, scientists said in 2013. This clay may have held the key ingredients for life billions of years ago. It means a lake must have existed in the area.
Martian dust appears on the surface of a penny, brought along with the Curiosity rover and photographed by the Mars Hand Lens Imager on October 2. The image of the 1909 coin is at the highest resolution possible for the high-powered camera -- 14 micrometers per pixel (a micrometer is about .000039 inches). The Curiosity rover took this image on September 10 of a rock formation informally dubbed "Darwin," first noted from the orbiting spacecraft. Scientists had the rover stop in this region, called Waypoint 1, because it appears to be a prime area to study the inner makeup and history of the floor of the Gale Crater. Analysis of Darwin may provide evidence of whether and how water played a role in the layering of rocks in this region.
The 2,000-pound rover Curiosity landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and has been sending back fascinating images and data ever since. Curiosity recently began a trek toward Mount Sharp after spending more than six months in the "Glenelg" area. This image was taken on July 16, after the rover passed the 1 kilometer mark for the total distance covered since the start of the mission. It still has over 8 kilometers (5 miles) to cover before reaching Mount Sharp, which will take several months. The lower slopes of Mount Sharp are visible at the top of this image, taken on Tuesday, July 9. The turret of tools at the end of the rover's arm, including the rock sampling drill in the lower left corner, can also be seen. This image taken by the rover on Monday, July 8, shows the tracks left behind after its first drive away from the "Glenelg" area, covering roughly 60 feet. Curiosity drilled into the rock target, called "Cumberland," on May 19, and collected a powdered sample of material from the rock's interior. The sample will be compared to an earlier drilling at the "John Klein" site, which has a similar appearance and is about nine feet away. Mars once had conditions favorable for microbial life, NASA scientists announced Tuesday, March 12, 2013. One piece of evidence for that conclusion comes from this area of the Martian surface, nicknamed "Sheepbed." It shows veins of sediments that scientist believe were deposited under water and was an environment once hospitable to life. The rock on the left, called Wopmay, was discovered by the rover Opportunity, which arrived in 2004 on a different part of Mars. Iron-bearing sulfates indicate that this rock was once in acidic waters. On the right are rocks from Yellowknife Bay, where rover Curiosity is situated. These newly discovered rocks are suggestive of water with a neutral pH, which is hospitable to life formation.
NASA's Curiosity rover shows the first sample of powdered rock extracted by the rover's drill. In subsequent steps, the sample will be sieved to be analyzed. The image was taken by Curiosity's mast camera on Wednesday, February 20.
The rover drilled this hole, in a rock that's part of a flat outcrop researchers named "John Klein," during its first sample drilling on Mars on February 8.
The latest self-portrait of the rover combines dozens of images taken by the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on February 3.
NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has taken its first set of nighttime photos, including this image of Martian rock illuminated by ultraviolet lights. Curiosity used the camera on its robotic arm, the Mars Hand Lens Imager, to capture the images on January 22.
Another nighttime image includes this rock called Sayunei in the Yellowknife Bay area of Mars' Gale Crater. Curiosity's front-left wheel had scraped the rock to inspect for fresh, dust-free materials in an area where drilling for rock soon will begin.
Other night photos includes this image of the calibration target for the Mars Hand Lens Imager camera at the end of the rover's robotic arm. For scale, a penny on the calibration target is three-fourths of an inch in diameter. A view of what NASA describes as "veined, flat-lying rock" selected as the first drilling site for the Mars rover taken on January 10.
Curiosity used a dust-removal tool for the first time to clean this patch of rock on the Martian surface on January 6. The rover captured this mosaic of images of winding rocks known as the Snake River on December 20, 2012. A view of the shallow depression known as "Yellowknife Bay," taken by the rover on December 12, 2012. The Mars rover Curiosity recorded this view from its left navigation camera after an 83-foot eastward drive on November 18, 2012. The view is toward "Yellowknife Bay" in the "Glenelg" area of Gale Crater. Three "bite marks" made by the rover's scoop can be seen in the soil on Mars surface on October 15, 2012. The robotic arm on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity delivered a sample of Martian soil to the rover's observation tray for the first time on October 16, 2012.
This image shows part of the small pit or bite created when NASA's Mars rover Curiosity collected its second scoop of Martian soil on October 15, 2012. The rover team determined that the bright particle near the center of the image was native to Mars, and not debris from the rover's landing.
This image shows what the rover team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing.
The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve. After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera.
This 360-degree panorama shows the area where the rover will spend about three weeks collecting scoopfuls of soil for examination. The photo comprises images taken from the rover's navigation camera on October 5, 2012.
An area of windblown sand and dust downhill from a cluster of dark rocks has been selected as the likely location for the first use of the scoop on the arm of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity. Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the "Rocknest" site on October 3, 2012. This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple. NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind.
This photos shows an up-close look at an outcrop that also shows evidence of flowing water, according to the JPL/Caltech science team. The outcrop's characteristics are consistent with rock that was formed by the deposition of water and is composed of many smaller rounded rocks cemented together. Water transport is the only process capable of producing the rounded shape of conglomerate rock of this size.
Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012. The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as "Glenelg." As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.
This image shows the robotic arm of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity with the first rock touched by an instrument on the arm. The photo was taken by the rover's right navigation camera.
This image combines photographs taken by the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager at three distances from the first Martian rock that NASA's Curiosity rover touched with its arm. The images reveal that the target rock has a relatively smooth, gray surface with some glinty facets reflecting sunlight and reddish dust collecting in recesses in the rock.
This rock will be the first target for Curiosity's contact instruments. Located on a turret at the end of the rover's arm, the contact instruments include the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer for reading a target's elemental composition and the Mars Hand Lens Imager for close-up imaging. Researchers used the Curiosity rover's mast camera to take a photo of the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer. The image was used to see if it had been caked in dust during the landing. Researchers also used the mast camera to examine the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on the rover to inspect its dust cover and check that its LED lights were functional. In this image, taken on September 7, 2012, the MAHLI is in the center of the screen with its LED on. The main purpose of Curiosity's MAHLI camera is to acquire close-up, high-resolution views of rocks and soil from the Martian surface.
This is the open inlet where powdered rock and soil samples will be funneled down for analysis. The image is made up of eight photos taken on September 11, 2012, by MAHLI and is used to check that the instrument is operating correctly.
This is the calibration target for the MAHLI. This image, taken on September 9, 2012, shows that the surface of the calibration target is covered with a layor of dust as a result of the landing. The calibration target includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a penny for scale comparison, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration. This view of the three left wheels of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity combines two images that were taken by the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager on September 9, 2012, the 34th day of Curiosity's work on Mars. In the distance is the lower slope of Mount Sharp.
This view of the lower front and underbelly areas of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity was taken by the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager. Also visible are the hazard avoidance cameras on the front of the rover. The penny in this image is part of a camera calibration target on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity. The image was taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager camera.
The rover captured this mosiac of a rock feature called 'Snake River" on December 20, 2012. The reclosable dust cover on Curiosity's Mars Hand Lens Imager was opened for the first time on September 8, 2012, enabling MAHLI to take this image. The Curiosity rover used a camera located on its arm to obtain this self-portrait on September 7, 2012. The image of the top of Curiosity's Remote Sensing Mast, showing the Mastcam and Chemcam cameras, was taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager. The angle of the frame reflects the position of the MAHLI camera on the arm when the image was taken.
The left eye of the Mast Camera on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity took this image of the rover's arm on Wednesday, September 5, 2012.
Sub-image one of three shows the rover and its tracks after a few short drives. Tracking the tracks will provide information on how the surface changes as dust is deposited and eroded.
Sub-image two shows the parachute and backshell, now in color. The outer band of the parachute has a reddish color.
Sub-image three shows the descent stage crash site, now in color, and several distant spots (blue in enhanced color) downrange that are probably the result of distant secondary impacts that disturbed the surface dust.
An image released August 27, 2012. was taken with Curiosity rover's 100-millimeter mast camera, NASA says. The image shows Mount Sharp on the Martian surface. NASA says the rover will go to this area. The Mars rover Curiosity moved about 15 feet forward and then reversed about 8 feet during its first test drive on August 22, 2012. The rover's tracks can be seen in the right portion of this panorama taken by the rover's navigation camera. NASA tested the steering on its Mars rover Curiosity on August 21. Drivers wiggled the wheels in place at the landing site on Mars.
Curiosity moved its robot arm on August 20, for the first time since it landed on Mars. "It worked just as we planned," said JPL engineer Louise Jandura in a NASA press release. This picture shows the 7-foot-long arm holding a camera, a drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and other tools. The arm will undergo weeks of tests before it starts digging.
With the addition of four high-resolution Navigation Camera, or Navcam, images, taken on August 18, Curiosity's 360-degree landing-site panorama now includes the highest point on Mount Sharp visible from the rover. Mount Sharp's peak is obscured from the rover's landing site by this highest visible point. This composite image, with magnified insets, depicts the first laser test by the Chemistry and Camera, or ChemCam, instrument aboard NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The composite incorporates a Navigation Camera image taken prior to the test, with insets taken by the camera in ChemCam. The circular insert highlights the rock before the laser test. The square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the laser interrogation of the rock. An updated self-portrait of the Mars rover Curiosity, showing more of the rover's deck. This image is a mosiac compiled from images taken from the navigation camera. The wall of Gale Crater, the rover's landing site, can be seen at the top of the image.
This image shows what will be the rover's first target with it's chemistry and camera (ChemCam) instrument. The ChemCam will fire a laser at the rock, indicated by the black circle. The laser will cause the rock to emit plasma, a glowing, ionized gas. The rover will then analyze the plasma to determine the chemical composition of the rock. This is a close-up of the rock that will be the ChemCam's first target. This image, cropped from a larger panorama, shows an area, near the rover's rear left wheel, where the surface material was blown away by the descent-stage rockets.
This image, with a portion of the rover in the corner, shows the wall of Gale Crater running across the horizon at the top of the image. This image, taken from the rover's mast camera, looks south of the landing site toward Mount Sharp. This partial mosaic from the Curiosity rover shows Mars' environment around the rover's landing site on Gale Crater. NASA says the pictured landscape resembles portions of the U.S. Southwest. The high-resolution mosaic includes 130 images, but not all the images have been returned by the rover to Earth. The blackened areas of the mosaic are the parts that haven't been transmitted yet. See more on this panaroma on NASA's site.
In this portion of the larger mosaic from the previous frame, the crater wall can be seen north of the landing site, or behind the rover. NASA says water erosion is believed to have created a network of valleys, which enter Gale Crater from the outside here.

Two blast marks from the descent stage's rockets can be seen in the center of this image. Also seen is Curiosity's left side. This picture is a mosaic of images taken by the rover's navigation cameras.
A color image from NASA's Curiosity rover shows the pebble-covered surface of Mars. This panorama mosaic was made of 130 images of 144 by 144 pixels each. Selected full frames from this panorama, which are 1,200 by 1,200 pixels each, are expected to be transmitted to Earth later.
A panoramic photograph shows the Curiosity rover's surroundings at its landing site inside Gale Crater. The rim of Gale Crater can be seen to the left, and the base of Mount Sharp is to the center-right.
A partial view of a 360-degree color panorama of the Curiosity rover's landing site on Gale Crater. The panorama comes from low-resolution versions of images taken Thursday, August 9, with a 34-millimeter mast camera. Cameras mounted on Curiosity's remote sensing mast have beamed back fresh images of the site.
NASA's Curiosity rover took this self-portrait using a camera on its newly deployed mast. A close-up view of an area at the NASA Curiosity landing site where the soil was blown away by the thrusters during the rover's descent on August 6. The excavation of the soil reveals probable bedrock outcrop, which shows the shallow depth of the soil in this area. This color full-resolution image showing the heat shield of NASA's Curiosity rover was obtained during descent to the surface of Mars on Monday, August 13. The image was obtained by the Mars Descent Imager instrument known as MARDI and shows the 15-foot diameter heat shield when it was about 50 feet from the spacecraft. This first image taken by the Navigation cameras on Curiosity shows the rover's shadow on the surface of Mars.
The color image captured by NASA's Mars rover Curiosity on Tuesday, August 7, has been rendered about 10% transparent so that scientists can see how it matches the simulated terrain in the background.
This image comparison shows a view through a Hazard-Avoidance camera on NASA's Curiosity rover before and after the clear dust cover was removed. Both images were taken by a camera at the front of the rover. Mount Sharp, the mission's ultimate destination, looms ahead. The four main pieces of hardware that arrived on Mars with NASA's Curiosity rover were spotted by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera captured this image about 24 hours after landing. This image is a 3-D view in front of NASA's Curiosity rover. The anaglyph was made from a stereo pair of Hazard-Avoidance Cameras on the front of the rover. Mount Sharp, a peak that is about 3.4 miles high, is visible rising above the terrain, though in one "eye" a box on the rover holding the drill bits obscures the view. This view of the landscape to the north of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity was acquired by the Mars Hand Lens Imager on Monday afternoon on the first day after landing.

This is one of the first pictures taken by Curiosity after it landed. It shows the rover's shadow on the Martian soil.
Another of the first images taken by the rover. The clear dust cover that protected the camera during landing has popped open. Part of the spring that released the dust cover can be seen at the bottom right, near the rover's wheel.
This image shows Curiosity's main science target, Mount Sharp. The rover's shadow can be seen in the foreground. The dark bands in the distances are dunes. Another of the first images beamed back from NASA's Curiosity rover on August 6 is the shadow cast by the rover on the surface of Mars.

Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Compare the Mars rovers Given the budget constraints facing the space agency, however, there are limits on what the rover, and NASA, will be able to do on the surface of the Red Planet. Although astronauts brought back thousands of moon rocks during the Apollo Mission, there's never been a sample of Martian material returned to Earth. Such a mission is considered a priority, so scientists can do more detailed chemical analyses. But it may not happen anytime soon.
"We're optimistic, given the success of our program, but we're anxious, too," said Richard Zurek, chief scientist for the Mars Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "Like all of us, we're anxious about our country's ability to be able to support and do these kinds of things."
I'm safely on the surface of Mars. GALE CRATER I AM IN YOU!!! #MSL— Curiosity Rover (@MarsCuriosity) August 6, 2012
NASA's budget for Mars exploration is slated to take a huge hit in 2013, dropping from $587 million to $361 million. It will then further decline to $228 million in 2014 and $189 million in 2015, rising slightly in 2016 before sloping upward to $503 million in 2017.
Images of Mars' earth-like landscape
Mars 'crime scene' photos Is the Mars rover vain?
Meet the man behind the photos of Mars Researchers landed Curiosity on Gale Crater, which is 96 miles across and may have once hosted a lake. Mount Sharp, in the middle of the crater, is composed of hundreds of rock layers accumulated over time. The rover will climb a small portion of the 3-mile-high mountain, testing different layers to search for organic molecules that could indicate the presence of life on the barren planet.
"We've demonstrated that we've got a landing system that worked. And it worked well," Zurek said, referring to Curiosity's dramatic touchdown. "The question now is: What will we use this for? Or will we have to step back from that because those kinds of missions -- of putting something that takes a metric ton down to the surface -- they're just too expensive for our future?"
The early days Curiosity is the latest in a long trajectory of missions that have allowed humanity to study Mars more extensively than any other planet apart from our own. A series of visits from Earth-made spacecrafts has taught us that Mars used to be a warmer, wetter place, perhaps with liquid water and even life.
Decades of research have led scientists to understand Martian history and pinpoint places on the planet where liquid water may have once flowed -- targets for future investigation, if money allows.
But getting to Mars didn't happen on the first try.
The USSR initiated a number of failed attempts to go to Mars in the early 1960s, including Sputnik 24, a lander that never left Earth's orbit. The United States also started out with bad luck: a failed flyby attempt by Mariner 3 in 1964.
Two blast marks from the descent stage's rockets can be seen in the center of this images. Also seen is Curiosity's left side. This image is a mosiac of images taken by the rover's naviagtion camers.
Earthlings' first successful landing on Mars happened in May 1971 with the Soviet Union's Mars 3 lander. It failed after sending 20 seconds of video data to the orbiter, however.
NASA claimed a big success the same year: Mariner 9 marked the first time a U.S. spacecraft had orbited a planet other than our own. This orbiter discovered river and channel-like features on Mars, and took the first high-resolution images of Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos.
Hopes were high for NASA's Viking mission, launched in 1975, which included two landers equipped to search for tiny organisms. The orbiters mapped the surface of the planet, while the landers monitored the weather and sent back color panoramic views of Mars.
"It was extraordinary engineering achievement. A huge amount of science came out," said Scott Hubbard, former head of NASA's Mars program and author of the book "Exploring Mars: Chronicles from a Decade of Discovery."
Mars rover indulges readers' Curiosity But the expectation of evidence of life -- namely, that the lander's arm would be able to put material into its chemistry kit and see organic molecules -- fell through. These molecules wouldn't prove that life existed, but they would be a signal that life was once possible there. There just wasn't conclusive evidence that Mars had these molecules.
Then came almost two decades of inactivity. NASA didn't send any other spacecraft to Mars until 1993 with the failed Mars Observer, followed by the successful orbiter Mars Global Surveyor in 1996.
Why the break? The space-shuttle program was one reason, said Zurek. NASA's priority at the time was manned vehicles, and budgets were tight. The Challenger disaster of 1986 also set NASA back.

Zurek believes we may be in a phase like that today, with not enough money to go around for all the programs NASA wants to develop. Also, the priority is once again in a new project: The Space Launch System, which will be the largest and most powerful rocket ever built.
Exploring Mars' surface
A game-changer was the discovery of a meteorite that appears to have come from Mars, found in Allan Hills, Antarctica, in 1984. Some scientists said they thought they saw evidence of tiny fossils that looked like dried-out life from Mars embedded in the meteorite.
No one knew where the meteorite came from, but it ignited a huge amount of interest in returning to Mars, Hubbard said. It also stressed the need to return samples from Mars to Earth, so they could be fully analyzed by multiple scientists.
"Without the Mars rock, we might not have Curiosity today," said Hubbard, whose job as the "first Mars czar" was to plan the next decade of exploration.
The first wheeled vehicle to land on Mars was during NASA's 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission, which consisted of a stationary lander and a surface rover called Sojourner. The rover was a mere 23 pounds and about the size of a large microwave oven. The mission demonstrated airbag technology in landing the rover without damage.

Japan got in on the Mars action in 1998 with the Nozomi orbiter, but the spacecraft failed to communicate.
At NASA, Hubbard's goals included understanding Mars as a system, looking for potentially habitable environments, examining whether the planet was habitable in the past and preparing to return samples from Mars to Earth.
"The sequence of landers was strategically planned to have ever-increasing capability to go forward and do more," he said.
NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey mission helped relay communications to Earth from the missions that would follow.
Europe entered the Mars race in 2003 with the Mars Express Orbiter and the Beagle 2 lander. Mars Express is still operating, but the lander never communicated from the surface.
Before Curiosity, NASA's big rover project was the Mars Exploration Rover Mission: two golf-cart-sized rovers called Spirit and Opportunity. They arrived on Mars in January 2004. Each rover was only supposed to operate for 90 days, but both far exceeded that time frame.
Spirit lasted for several years before it lost one of its wheels. As it hobbled along, it broke through the crust of the surface and got stuck in an area called Troy.
During its escape, another of Spirit's wheels failed. But while stuck, Spirit had a breakthrough: it found soil rich in sulfates, which are a component of steam. This suggests there may have once been conditions on Mars able to support life.
Signs of water?
As long as Curiosity has healthy mobility, it shouldn't find itself stuck in this kind of situation, said John Callas, project manager of the mission. The newest rover also uses brushless motors, which don't have the wear mechanism of the motors in Spirit and Opportunity.
Spirit stopped communicating in 2010. Opportunity, meanwhile, still chugs along and sent back its 100,000th picture in July. The rover also found a vein of the mineral gypsum, which indicates water may have once flowed on Mars.
His other car is on Mars
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2005, conducted analyses that helped scientists determine where Curiosity should land. The orbiter also found in 2008 a new kind of mineral, called opaline silica, which suggested that liquid water had been on Mars as recently as 2 billion years ago. The theory is that volcanic activity or meteorite impact on Mars created materials that liquid water would have altered, and the result is opaline silica.
MRO camera imagery also suggested that briny water may flow near Mars' equator in its southern hemisphere. These surface features appear to fade in the winter and reutrn in the spring. The possible liquid flows are extremely small and narrow.
Further clues to water on Mars came from the Phoenix Mars Lander, which arrived on Mars in May 2008. The lander studied the thin Martian atmosphere, consisting of 95% carbon dioxide. Isotopes of carbon and oxygen can tell a lot about whether water existed on the planet.
Data from Phoenix suggested that the Martian surface has interacted with liquid water, and even in modern times. The data also indicated that the planet had volcanic activity as recently as several million years ago. The chemical signature seen in the carbon dioxide points toward liquid water that was primarily at temperatures near freezing.
Mars is most Earth-like planet we have found, for certain.James Wray
Also, the lander's robotic arm camera discovered possible evidence of ice at its landing site.
What do you think about the Mars mission?
MAVEN and beyond
The next Mars mission is the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission, or MAVEN, which is scheduled to launch late next year. The instruments for it are already built, Zurek said.
Evidence gained through previous missions suggests that early in its history -- perhaps as much as 4 billion years ago -- Mars was a wetter place. Where did that water go?
It could be that water is frozen into the planet's surface, as observations from Phoenix suggested. But the water could have also been lost to space. Mars doesn't have a global magnetic field like the Earth does, so charged particles emitted from the sun -- the solar wind -- affect Mars in a much bigger way. The current theory is that the solar wind "stole" most of Mars' atmosphere, so radiation from the sun quickly boils any remaining liquid water.
MAVEN will measure the interaction of solar wind with current atmosphere, Zurek said. Using models of the sun's history, scientists may be able to estimate how much water the planet could have lost.
"MAVEN is the next mission. We don't want it to be the last mission in Mars exploration for a similar period, like in the '80s where there were no Mars missions, and everything was sort of on hold," Zurek said.
Meanwhile, Europe plans to launch the ExoMars Orbiter and a ground-based probe in 2016. The probe, called the Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module, isn't expected to last long, and is meant to be a demonstration of landing technologies. It will perform limited scientific experiments during its brief life.
European space officials and NASA were going to work together on a trace gas orbiter, but NASA pulled out because of budgetary reasons. Instead, the European Space Agency is working with Russia's Roscosmos. The plan is to launch the ExoMars rover in 2018, carrying European and Russian instruments.
Future questions
Exploration of the moon has been more extensive than Mars in many respects. In addition to fly-bys and orbiters, six Apollo missions sent humans to the moon and brought them back between 1963 and 1972.
The moon is closer to Earth than Mars, but also has a less diverse terrain. The interior of the moon is still mysterious, which is why NASA sent twin lunar orbiters called Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory, or GRAIL, to investigate. But consider that while sending an SUV-sized rover to Mars is a celebrated achievement, astronauts drove a "moon buggy" 40 years ago.
We haven't figured out how to send people to Mars yet. The planet is cold and dry, with dust storms that can circle the entire planet and an atmosphere that would be toxic to humans.
"Mars is the most Earth-like planet we have found, for certain," says James Wray, assistant professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and member of the Curiosity science team. "That's not saying as much as you would like it to be saying."
NASA still has a lot of questions about Mars. Has the planet hosted life? Does it host life now, in a place we have yet to discover? Has the climate on Mars changed in a way we can understand? And could Mars be a near-term destination for astronauts?
To send a mission to Mars that would bring back samples, there are a few fundamental engineering questions that need to be answered, says Hubbard: Can scientists pinpoint where they want to go and have a spacecraft land there? Can we collect a soil sample? Can we re-enter the Earth's atmosphere?
Science has proven the answers to the first three questions are "yes." But a fourth question -- can we safely load the Mars sample onto a spacecraft that's returning to Earth? -- is trickier. A rocket would have to be carried to Mars, sit there for a year, blast off and then rendezvous with another spacecraft.
Such an endeavor would require millions of dollars of research and development work. But NASA's projected budget for Mars exploration has "now gotten to the point that it's so low that you could not contemplate doing what I just described," Hubbard said.
The next step after MAVEN remains unclear. There are three other sites that had been considered for Curiosity that could be worth exploring with a surface-based spacecraft. Budget permitting, Hubbard also would eventually like to land another rover on Mars, because a stationary device with a six-foot arm isn't nearly as good as exploring the varied terrains of the planet.
"Mars is far more diverse than anybody thought," he said. "Roving is the way to go. Even though it's more difficult, that's what you need."
NASA officials are hopeful the current dire budgetary situation won't last too long.
Congress has signaled that money will be put back into planetary sciences, said Hubbard, who believes scientists will continue to be vocal about the value of Mars exploration.
"I think this [space science] community is going to make some noise," he said.

Mom: Texas shooter had mental health issues
By Mariano Castillo, CNN
updated 5:30 AM EDT, Wed August 15, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The gunman apologized as he lay dying, a medic and witness says
Police: Thomas Caffall was the gunman who killed two and injured four
He was fatally shot by police in College Station, Texas
Among the victims was Brian Bachmann, a highly regarded law enforcement officer
(CNN) -- The gunman who killed two others before police ended his life in a shootout near Texas A&M University had been battling mental health issues on and off for years, his mother said.
Police say Thomas Caffall, known to his family as "Tres," killed a constable and a bystander and injured four others Monday before police fatally shot him.
His mother, Linda Weaver, said the family became worried after Caffall quit his job in January and announced that he would never work again.
3 killed in shootings near Texas A&M
"We had been very concerned about him," Weaver told CNN.
Slain College Station Police Department Constable Brian Bachmann.
Caffall had withdrawn from the family, and the fear was that he might attempt suicide, his mother said.
But she never imagined that her son would hurt anyone else, or that his end would come so violently.
"Losing a child is a parent's worst nightmare. This is worse," she said.
Police said Caffall, 35, shot and killed Brian Bachmann, a constable for Brazos County, and Chris Northcliffe, an area resident.
Bachmann had approached Caffall's apartment to deliver an eviction notice, and Northcliffe just happened to be nearby.
Shooting suspect's mom speaks
Witnesses describe deadly shootout Also nearby was Rigo Cisneros, a former Army medic who assisted both Bachmann and Caffall after the shooting.
As he lay dying, the gunman offered an apology for what he had done, Cisneros told CNN's Brooke Baldwin.
"He did ask me to apologize to the officer he had shot," he said.
Three College Station police officers and a woman were injured in the shooting, police said. The woman, Barbara Holdsworth, was in serious condition after undergoing surgery.
Investigators on Tuesday continued to process the crime scene.
The area covers "a couple of blocks," College Station Police Chief Jeff Capps said.
The suspect "fired multiple rounds and investigators have recovered long guns and a pistol from the scene," he said.
As the incident unfolded Monday, an alert warning of a gunman was sent out by Texas A&M, one of the state's flagship universities and a sprawling campus of nearly 47,000 students.
According to his Facebook campaign page, Bachmann was a 41-year-old from College Station who had been a Brazos County sheriff's deputy since 1993. The county's website indicated that his four-year term as constable -- an elected position that involves, among other duties, serving court documents such as eviction notices and subpoenas to citizens -- was set to expire on December 31, 2014.
Warning signs of violence: What to do
Bachmann was an up-and-coming law enforcement leader who some expected to run for sheriff one day, said Marc Hamlin, the district clerk for Brazos County and friend of the slain constable for more than 20 years.
"He was a true public servant," Hamlin told CNN.
Whenever a group wanted a law enforcement officer or squad car for a community event, Bachmann was always the first to volunteer, Hamlin said.
He also volunteered to help his friends.
On Monday, Bachmann had lunch with his chief deputy, who had to deliver the eviction notice at the nearby residence afterward. Bachmann took the notice and volunteered to serve it himself, Hamlin said.
A search of court records showed no record of Caffall having run-ins with the law except for a traffic violation.
Caffall's mother described her son as an intelligent youth who wasted opportunities available to him.
"It's so hard to imagine that the really sweet kid you raised turned into a huge monster, and that is what he is now," Weaver said.
He enjoyed collecting weapons and refinishing them, Weaver said, so his owning guns wasn't worrisome, his mother said.
Weaver said Caffall had been very affected by the death of his father when he was 12. She said it is hard to comprehend how the same person would deprive Bachmann's children of their father.
Bachmann's three children -- ages 19, 10 and 8 -- would accompany their father on mission trips in Texas. On a recent trip, they built wheelchair ramps and roofs, Hamlin said.
"He was strong in his faith and strong in his family," he said.
Less is known about Caffall. He was divorced, and was in the constant companionship of a large Sheltie-mix named Lucy, his mother said. Lucy's fate is unclear.

Southwest charges extra to board first
By Katia Hetter, CNN
updated 5:21 PM EST, Tue January 22, 2013
Southwest is charging customers to get to the front of the boarding line. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A $40 fee will get you to the front of the boarding line
Certain fliers already pay extra to board first, pick their seats People who don't want to fight for overhead bin space can check one or two bags for free
(CNN) -- Want to be the first to board a Southwest Airlines flight?
It'll cost you.
Starting 45 minutes before a flight's departure, any remaining spots in the airline's "A" boarding group can now be purchased for a $40 fee payable by credit card.
"Offering customers the option to improve their boarding position on day of travel is one more way we can offer the travel experience that best fits their needs," said Kevin Krone, Southwest Airlines vice president of marketing, sales and distribution, in a press release.
The airline doesn't assign seats but it does give certain fliers the right to board before other fliers. They include people who buy Business Select Fares, Rapid Rewards Members with A-List and A-List Preferred status, and EarlyBird Check-In customers. Those early boarders have first crack at the best seats and overhead bin space.
Got that? Southwest's boarding practices are unusual enough compared to other airlines that they've got an online tutorial.
"This is yet another of several recent attempts by Southwest to add peripheral fees so that it can raise revenues without tarnishing its image," wrote Brett Snyder, president of The Cranky Flier, in an e-mail. "Southwest's elite travelers won't like that people can buy their way to the front of the line, but it will be welcomed by those at the back. This is the first effort Southwest has made to allow people to better their position once they know their boarding number."
The airline does offer two free pieces of checked baggage, so there's no need to fight over overhead space unless you need it.
AirTran Airways, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines, is not charging this fee. However, Southwest continues its program of repainting AirTran planes in Southwest colors, putting them back into service as Southwest flights and charging Southwest fares and fees, a Southwest spokeswoman confirmed.

Zumba helps woman drop 123 pounds
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Jacque Wilson, CNN
updated 12:52 AM EDT, Fri April 5, 2013
At 21, Ashlee Tomsche weighed 331 pounds. Her body mass index, or BMI, was 44, which the National Institutes of Health considers to be significantly obese.
Tomsche had tried to lose weight before by walking on a treadmill, but she quickly got bored. Then in January 2012, she decided to go to her first Zumba class.
Tomsche credits her instructor Maria Venegas, bottom left, with helping her stick to an exercise routine. "It's just so much fun," Tomsche says of Zumba.
Tomsche's mother, Terri, has also jumped on the Zumba train. They participated in a Relay for Life event with other members from their class in June 2012.
By taking Zumba classes five to six days a week, Tomsche has dropped 123 pounds.
Tomsche used to wear a size 26 pant. Now she wears a size 14.
Tomsche weighs 208 pounds, but she says she hopes to get under 200 to be in a healthy weight range.
A professional photographer on weekends, Venegas took pictures of Tomsche after her weight loss and posted them to Facebook. "People were very surprised and inspired by her transformation," Venegas says. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Zumba is a Latin-inspired dance fitness class with an intense calorie burn
Ashlee Tomsche lost six dress sizes and 10 inches from her waist doing Zumba
Tomsche also tracked her calories on a mobile app

(CNN) -- Ashlee Tomsche walked into the rec center with trepidation. Images of six-pack abs and neon sports bras from the Zumba infomercials she had watched flashed through her mind.
I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought.
With her head down, she walked into the aerobics room and took a spot in the back. She was 21 and weighed 331 pounds.
Zumba is a Latin-inspired dance fitness class that blends booty shaking with international music and an intense calorie burn. Since the company launched in 2001, Zumba classes have spread to 14 million people in 150 countries, according to Zumba.com.
Tomsche's first class was hard. She had to stop several times to catch her breath. But she came back the next day. And then again the next. A year later, she had dropped 123 pounds, six dress sizes and more than 10 inches from her waist.
"It's just crazy," the Arkansas City, Kansas, resident says. "We're having too much fun."
Comfort food
Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds.
"It really hit me hard, and I turned to food for comfort," she remembers. "It was always there."
She indulged in chips and ice cream, and drank soda by the gallon. She would eat an entire pizza by herself in one sitting. Every time she binged on junk food, she felt sick and swore she'd never do it again. But overeating had already taken its toll.
She didn't go out because she wasn't confident in her body. Instead she came home right after work to snack in front of the TV. Once in a while she would hit the gym to walk on the treadmill, but it bored her more than empowering her.
"I knew I needed to lose weight, but I never knew where to start," she says. "I would try something for a few months and give up."
Then she found Zumba.
Just dance
Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class. Tomsche wore baggy clothing and seemed unsure in her body.
"She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class," Venegas says. "But she would get right back up and continue to do what she could."
Venegas teaches seven Zumba classes a week in Arkansas City in addition to working as an office manager and professional photographer.
"I used to think it was my kids that kept me young," the single mother of two says. "But it has been my venture to become a Zumba instructor that has (been) the fountain of youth, for myself and many others."
Venegas creates her own routines, incorporating music from popular artists such as Michael Jackson and Ne-Yo into her classes. In a typical hourlong class, participants burn between 300 and 650 calories.
"Every class is always different," Tomsche says. "I'm addicted."
Tomsche loves Zumba so much she didn't even realize at first she was losing weight. But after four months, she had dropped 20 pounds and was getting compliments from her classmates. The attention encouraged her to keep going.
"Now (she) walks in with a big smile ... shoulders back and head up high," Venegas says.
Small town, big inspiration
Tomsche tracks her daily calories on the MyFitnessPal app and drinks protein shakes for breakfast. Giving up junk food has been hard, but she splurges occasionally on thin-crust pizza or Nutella on whole wheat waffles.
Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day. Her hard work has paid off -- she weighs 208 pounds and wears a size 14 pants.
"The simplest things in life have become easier," Tomsche wrote in a CNN iReport submission. "I don't feel like I can't breathe when I bend over to tie my shoes. I'm not out of breath when I walk up and down the halls at work, and even sleeping is easier since I don't have all that excess weight pressing down on me."
Venegas offered to do a professional photo shoot with Tomsche in January, and they posted the pictures online. Venegas' Zumba classes quickly filled up. She says Tomsche has inspired their small community.
Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back.
"I never thought coming from a town of 12,000 (people) that I would be an inspiration for anyone," she says. "It's just given me so much confidence in myself."
Her advice for others who are struggling to lose weight? Find a workout that you love.
"It can be done," she says simply.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
U.N.'s Ban Ki-moon calls for "calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint''
Morsy is under "house arrest," a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman says
Obama says U.S. reviewing aid, urges return to civilian rule
Eight dead across Egypt, Health Minister says Are you in Egypt? Send us your experiences, but please stay safe.
Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's military toppled the country's first democratically elected president Wednesday night and reportedly put him under house arrest while rounding up some of his top supporters even as the deposed Mohamed Morsy insisted that he remains the country's legitimate leader.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Egypt over the military's actions that were decried by Morsy's supporters as a "coup" and celebrated as a "correction" by his opponents. At least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in sporadic violence that at times pitted Morsy's supporters against the opposition and the military.
What comes next in Egypt?
Egypt: Battle over the word 'coup'
Activist: People held hostage by Morsy Muslim Brotherhood: Protests won't stop
Morsy "did not achieve the goals of the people" and failed to meet the generals' demands that he share power with his opposition, Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, said in a televised speech to the nation.
Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, will replace Morsy as Egypt's interim president, El-Sisi said. Mansour was expected to be sworn in on Thursday.
The military has not publicly commented on Morsy's whereabouts. But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad told CNN the deposed president was under "house arrest" at the presidential Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo. He said some members of Morsy's inner circle have also put under house arrest.
The country's constitution has been suspended, and Mansour will "establish a government that is a strong and diverse," said El-Sisi, head of the country's armed forces. New parliamentary elections will be held, and Mansour will have the power to issue constitutional declarations in the meantime, he said.
El-Sisi said the military was fulfilling its "historic responsibility" to protect the country by ousting Morsy, a Western-educated Islamist elected a year ago.
Morsy remained defiant and insisted he was Egypt's proper president.
"The world is looking at us today," he said in a taped statement delivered to the Arabic satellite network Al Jazeera. "We by ourselves can bypass the obstacles. We, the sons of Egypt, the sons of this country -- this is the will of the people and cannot be canceled."
Shortly after Morsy's statement aired, Al Jazeera reported its Cairo studios were raided during a live broadcast on Wednesday and its presenter, guests and producers arrested.
The Muslim Brotherhood, the long-repressed political movement that propelled Morsy to office, said its broadcast outlets had been shut down.

Muslim Brotherhood arrests
The state-run Middle East News Agency said the two top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party had been taken into custody, and another state-run outlet, the newspaper Al-Ahram, said another 300 were being sought by police.
El-Haddad told CNN that he has been told hundreds of names have been put on an "arrest list" but couldn't confirm any arrests beyond those of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party chief, Saad el-Katatni, and its deputy, Rashad Al-Bayoumi.
Morsy said he remains open to negotiations and dialogue, and he called on supporters to demonstrate peacefully.
But at least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in clashes around the country on Wednesday, Health Minister Dr. Mohamed Mustafa Hamid told Al-Ahram.
U.S. student killed in Egypt was enthralled with region
Morsy opponents who packed Tahrir Square, now the epicenter of two Egyptian upheavals, erupted in jubilation and fireworks when El-Sisi made his announcement.
"This is a united people of Egypt," anti-Morsy organizer Ahmed el Hawary said. "Mohamed Morsy has actually succeeded in uniting the people, after two years that we were totally against each other ... Mohamed Morsy, with his bad management, with his risking all the lives of Egypt, brought all Egyptians back together to be facing again their future, hand in hand."
But Abdoul Mawgoud Dardery, a former member of parliament from the Morsy-allied Freedom and Justice Party, called that "ridiculous."
"I don't know how can anyone with common sense support a military coup in a democracy," he said. Egyptians "will never recognize a coup d'etat," he said.
And across the Nile River from Tahrir Square, Morsy supporters chanted chanted "Down with military rule" and "The square has a million martyrs."
Before Wednesday night's announcement, troops moved into key positions around the capital, closing off a bridge over the Nile and surrounding Rabaa Adawya Square, where Morsy's supporters were gathered.

Military had demanded reforms
Morsy was elected president in June 2012. But his approval ratings have plummeted as his government has failed to keep order or revive Egypt's economy. The chaos, including open sexual assaults on women in Egypt's streets, has driven away tourists and investors, while opponents say Morsy's rule was increasingly authoritarian.
Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a leading opposition figure, said the plans announced Wednesday were "a correction for the way of the revolution" that drove Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011.
Opinion: In Egypt, rage must lead to game plan
"The road map guarantees achieving the principal demand of the Egyptian people -- having early presidential elections through an interim period through which the constitution will be amended," he said. "So all of us build it together and agree on a democratic constitution, so we can guarantee our freedoms."
The Egyptian military dominated the country for six decades and took direct power for a year and a half after Mubarak's ouster. On Monday, after a previous demand that Morsy offer concessions to the opposition, it gave him 48 hours to order reforms.
As the hour of the ultimatum neared, Morsy offered to form an interim coalition government to oversee parliamentary elections and revise the constitution that was enacted in January.
"One of the mistakes I cannot accept -- as the president of all Egyptians -- is to side with one party over another, or to present the scene from one side only. To be fair, we need to listen to the voice of people in all squares," he said.
Rand Paul: Stop using U.S. taxpayer money to aid Morsy
Shortly after the deadline, Morsy aide Essam El Haddad said in a Facebook posting that a coup was under way and warned that the generals risked bloodshed by moving against Morsy.
"In a democracy, there are simple consequences for the situation we see in Egypt: The president loses the next election or his party gets penalized in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Anything else is mob rule," he wrote.
But Naguib Abadeer, a member of the opposition Free Egyptians Party, said what was under way "is not by any means a military coup. This is a revolution."
Morsy lost his legitimacy in November, when he declared courts could not review his decrees and ousted the country's prosecutor-general, Abadeer said. And the Muslim Brotherhood "hijacked the vote of the people" by running on a religious platform, "so these were not democratic elections," he said.
Egypt's anti-Morsy protestors -- in their own words
Obama says U.S. reviewing aid
In Washington, President Barack Obama said the United States is "deeply concerned" by Morsy's removal and the suspension of the constitution.
Egyptian ambassador: This was not a coup
Analysis: Victory, or 'a sad day' for Egypt? U.S. Embassy in Egypt evacuated
Morsy critic supports 'new road map' Washington has supplied Egypt's military with tens of billions in support and equipment over more than 30 years, and under U.S. law, that support could be cut off after a coup -- a term his White House statement avoided.
"The United States does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the rule of law," Obama said.
He said he had ordered "the relevant departments and agencies" to study what American law would mean for U.S. aid and urged the generals to hand power back to an elected government 'as soon as possible."
In the wake of Morsy's ouster, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed Obama's call for an immediate return to civilian rule. He appealed for "calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint."
Wednesday's events capped days of massive demonstrations for and against Morsy. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but health officials said 23 people died in clashes overnight at Cairo University, Al-Ahram reported.
Anti-Morsy demonstrators have ransacked Muslim Brotherhood offices around Egypt in the past several days.
Obama called Morsy on Monday to urge him to take a less-rigid stance toward his opponents, telling his Egyptian counterpart "that democracy is about more than elections," a White House statement said. But the State Department denied that Obama had urged Morsy to call early elections, as a senior administration official had said Tuesday.
Opinion: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy
Morsy's opposition said it had collected more than 20 million signatures on a petition to remove him -- millions more than the number who voted Morsy into the presidency.
Tuesday night, Morsy had vowed that he would not comply with the ultimatum and demanded that the armed forces stand down, even "if the price of upholding this legitimacy is my own blood." But political analyst Hisham Kassem told CNN the speech was Morsy's "final bluff."
"He was trying to give the impression 'We are there in numbers, and we are going to retaliate, we are not going to allow this to happen.' However, with almost 24 hours since his message, it's clear his supporters will not dare challenge the crowds on the street," Kassem said.
And faced with the throngs that filled Cairo's Tahrir Square, "the military had to intervene. Otherwise this crowd was going to get Morsy from his palace."
CNN spells the deposed president's name with a 'y' in accordance with what his spokesman said is his personal preference, his own e-mail and the country's Foreign Ministry.
Should tourists still visit Egypt?
CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Ivan Watson, Jill Dougherty, Dan Lothian, Amir Ahmed, Ben Brumfield, Ali Younes, Chelsea J. Carter, Schams Elwazer, Elise Labott, Ian Lee, Housam Ahmed and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.

Why is Ted Cruz going to Mandela's memorial service? By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN
updated 11:10 AM EST, Tue December 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is traveling with 22 members of Congress to South Africa
The only other Republican attending is Rep. Aaron Schock
He received vocal backlash for posting condolences for Nelson Mandela
Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, was a member of the congressional delegation traveling to South Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial services. McGovern was not part of the delegation.
Washington (CNN) -- What do tea party aligned Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington state have in common?
Not a whole lot. But they are traveling to South Africa together to attend Nelson Mandela's memorial service.
The December 10 service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium will feature U.S. political luminaries, including President Barack Obama and former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Cruz's office did not indicate the freshman Senator has any connection to Mandela, but Cruz said in a statement that he was "honored" to be able to attend the event.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, congressional Democrats to commemorate Mandela in South Africa
Cruz is the only senator on the taxpayer-funded trip. He is with 22 members of Congress, mostly from the Congressional Black Caucus, which organized the trip that House Speaker John Boehner authorized.
On the 20-hour flight, Cruz could sit near the only other Republican to attend, Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois. Schock said he was "humbled" to be asked by Boehner to lead the delegation and represent House Republicans.
Or Cruz could sit near civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia and other members of the CBC, who tend to have more liberal political leanings.
Secret Service prepares for Obama's last-minute trip to South Africa Cruz seems like the odd person out. The 42-year-old freshman firebrand has made a name for himself in the Senate, most recently for his filibuster to defund the Affordable Care Act.
Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the House-organized trip was "opened to the Senate."
"We notified all Senate offices of the quick availability. Senator Cruz requested to go on the trip," Stewart said.
When Cruz posted a note of condolence on his Facebook page last week, saying Mandela "will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe," angry commenters blasted him for praising the South African leader, who died last week at 95.
Seliqua Bodina wrote, "Wow you stepped in it this time." And Dan Noxon said, "Why don't all you Mandela lovers head on over to South Africa and see what's going on now that 'Mandela's people' have control of the nation .... get out and mix with the people, experience what life is really like. Especially if you're white."
Told about Cruz's trip, Republican strategist, John Feehery, said he was "speechless." But then he said, "Good for him."
"Sometimes the best way to be a profile in courage is by taking on the nut jobs," Feehery said, referring to the ugly comments Cruz got last week.
Considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate, Cruz could benefit politically from the trip. Feehery said there is very little political risk in going and possibly a lot to gain.
"You look like a statesman; you make invaluable contacts, since every important person in the world is going to be there," Feehery said.
A politically and personally challenging moment for Cruz could be when Cuban President Raul Castro speaks at the service.
Cruz's dad is from Cuba but fled at the age of 18 and Cruz is a vocal critic of the Castro regime, especially of former President Fidel Castro.
On Mandela, Cruz said, "He nobly chose reconciliation instead of retribution -- a legacy for which he will be remembered forever."
