Obama's ahead, polls say, but will the lead last? Story Highlights Obama leads by 8 points in most recent CNN national poll of polls Polls tend to tighten up as Election Day nears when a non-incumbent leads Election Tracker: See the latest state and national polls Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Manav Tanneeru CNN	(CNN) -- With a week to go before Election Day, most recent national polls show Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama with an advantage. But how much are they to be believed? As Election Day gets closer, will the race tighten in the polls? The most recent national CNN poll of polls showed Obama with an 8-point lead over Republican presidential nominee John McCain, 51 percent to 43 percent. The polls were conducted October 21 through October 26. Most other national polls show Obama with a lead ranging between 5 points and double digits. A look at CNN polling during the same period before Election Day in 2000 and 2004 suggests that political observers and campaign supporters ought to be cautious in declaring the race over because of current polling numbers. See the latest state and national polls When a presidential race has a non-incumbent in the lead, like this year, the poll numbers tend to tighten as Election Day gets closer, CNN senior researcher Alan Silverleib said.

Calculator: You call the race
iReport.com: Are you election obsessed?
"Any time it looks like they are on the verge of voting somebody new into office, there is buyer's remorse," he said. "Based on that, and the fact that the country has been so polarized in recent elections, there's pretty good reason to think that the polls might tighten up a little bit." Four years ago, a national CNN poll of polls released about a week before Election Day showed President Bush leading Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry by 3 points, 49 percent to 46 percent. The poll was released October 25 and reflected likely voters' choice for president. Election Day was November 2 in 2004. A national CNN poll of polls released November 1 showed Bush leading Kerry by 2 points, 48 percent to 46 percent. President Bush won by 3 percentage points, 51 percent to 48 percent. In 2000, it was a bit of a different story. Election Day arrived November 7 that year. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll conducted October 29 through October 31 showed Bush, then the Texas governor, leading Democratic Sen. Al Gore, 48 percent to 43 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. A subsequent poll conducted November 2 through November 4, released two days before the voters cast their ballots, showed the same results. Gore, however, ended up winning the popular vote by about 540,000 votes. When broken down by percentage, both candidates had about 48 percent of the popular vote. Bush won the Electoral College, and thereby the presidency, by 5 electoral votes. Two of the battleground states this year, as in many recent presidential elections, are Ohio and Florida. What did the polls say before Election Day in those states four years ago? In Florida, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted about a week before Election Day showed Bush leading Kerry 51 percent to 43 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points and was conducted October 21 through October 24. Kerry caught up to Bush in the polls before Election Day and led by a single point, 48 percent to 47 percent, in a similar poll conducted October 28 through October 31. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Bush won Florida by 5 percentage points in 2004. In Ohio four years ago, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed Kerry leading Bush by a point -- 49 percent to 48 percent -- about two weeks before Election Day. The poll was conducted October 17 through October 20 and had margin of error of plus or minus 4 points. A week before November 7, Election Day, a similar poll showed Kerry leading Bush 50 percent to 46 percent. The poll was conducted October 28 through October 31, and the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Bush won Ohio by 2 points in 2004, 51 percent to 49 percent. Obama leads McCain in recent CNN poll of polls conducted in both states. In Florida, he leads McCain 49 percent to 45 percent. The polls were conducted October 23 through October 26. In Ohio, Obama has an 8-point lead over McCain, 50 percent to 42 percent. The polls were conducted October 22 through October 27. 'Buyer's remorse' in recent history There have been a few examples of such "buyer's remorse" in recent history, Silverleib said. "We saw that with [Arkansas Gov. Bill] Clinton in 1992, when the polls suddenly tightened up during the last week," he said. "It was almost like people saying, 'Do we really want this guy?' " They did. Clinton soundly defeated President George H.W. Bush, 43 percent to 37 percent. In another example, polls tightened during the 1968 presidential race between Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat Hubert Humphrey. Nixon led by double digits among registered voters in late September, according to a Gallup analysis published Monday. The lead dwindled to 8 points in a poll conducted October 17 through October 22. By early November, Nixon was clinging to a 1-point lead. The poll was conducted October 29 through November 1 and surveyed likely voters, according to Gallup. Nixon won by less than 1 percentage point. "Humphrey had all the momentum at the end, and there's an open question there that had that election gone on for another week, Humphrey might very well had won," Silverleib said. There is then the oft-cited example of Thomas Dewey and Harry Truman in 1948. Polls predicted that Dewey would win, but Truman pulled off the upset. Silverleib, however, is reluctant to cite that race as illustrative of the accuracy of contemporary polls. "People talk about Dewey and Truman, but they stopped polling a couple of weeks before the election," he said, adding, "polling then wasn't nearly as refined a science as it is now." However, in what might be a bit of sobering news for the McCain campaign, since 1956, front-runners in late October lost the popular vote only twice after being ahead in the Gallup poll a week before Election Day, according to that polling organization's analysis. Obama held a lead in both of Gallup's likely voter tracking polls released Tuesday.

Burris says he's honored to be seated in the SenateStory Highlights Roland Burris commends Senate leadership for their help Senate Majority Leader Reid says Roland Burris to be seated Senate officials spent weekend researching legality of Burris' appointment to Senate Burris was appointed by Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who faces corruption charges Next Article in Politics » From Evan Glass and Dana Bash CNN	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Illinois Senate-designate Roland Burris said Monday afternoon that he is "truly humbled and honored" to learn he will be seated in the Senate later this week. Senate-designate Roland Burris, D-Illinois, said Monday that he is humbled by news that he will be seated. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Illinois senior senator and Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin said the Senate would accept Burris' credentials. "The Secretary of the Senate has determined that the new credentials presented today on behalf of Mr. Burris now satisfy Senate Rules and validate his appointment to the vacant Illinois Senate seat. In addition, as we requested, Mr. Burris has provided sworn testimony before the Illinois House Committee on Impeachment regarding the circumstances of his appointment," the two said in a statement. At a news conference around 5:30 p.m. ET, Burris publicly thanked Reid and Durbin. "It will be my honor to both serve with them and learn from them," he said. "I'm thankful for the opportunity to serve, and I ask for your support and prayers." Burris also took time to praise Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, who opposed seating Burris, and did not sign his appointment certificate, although his office stamped it Friday to show it had been received. "He [White] is owed a debt of gratitude. He also happened to be someone's whose autograph I cherish," Burris said. "[He's] an honorable man."

In the joint statement, Reid and Durbin said Burris would "be accorded all the rights and privileges of a Senator-elect," adding that "barring objections from Senate Republicans, we expect Senator-designee Burris to be sworn in and formally seated later this week. We are working with him and the office of the Vice President to determine the date and time of the swearing-in." A spokesman for the Obama transition team said the president-elect knows Burris and has a "high regard for him." "He looks forward to working with Senator Burris and the rest of the United States Senate to rebuild our economy and meet the great challenges of our time," Dan Pfeiffer said. Some Senate Democrats, however, said Burris should not be seated because he was appointed to the Senate seat by Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who faces corruption charges and who is accused of scheming to sell the seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled Friday that White does not have to sign off on the appointment for it to be valid. Still, the Senate parliamentarian and legal counsel worked over the weekend examining in-house rules on the issue. Democratic sources said that if Burris or his attorney is at the Capitol on Monday, they would probably receive a decision. Burris told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that his attorney would meet with the Senate's legal counsel on Monday. "It is our position that we have done everything that's required and that, yes, I should be seated and I should be seated forthwith and I should be seated prior to the inauguration of our 44th president, a seat for which I now hold," Burris said during the interview. "And, by the way, I am the junior senator from the state of Illinois. There is no question of my legality of appointment. Illinois has two senators. That is the law. We have two senators." In refusing to seat Burris last week, the Senate cited a 125-year-old Senate rule requiring the signature to certify an appointment. But in a victory for Blagojevich, the Illinois high court said that "no explanation has been given as to how any rule of the Senate, whether it be formal or merely a matter of tradition, could supersede the authority to fill vacancies conferred on the states by the federal constitution." Even if White's stamp is accepted as valid, Senate Democrats still plan to take the matter to the Senate Rules Committee, so an investigation can be conducted and the matter can be voted on by the full Senate before Burris is seated. The Illinois House voted Friday to impeach Blagojevich, who has denied any wrongdoing.

Macedonia PM: We want deal with Greece over name disputeFrom Nic Robertson, CNN Macedonia PM Nikolai Gruevksi on the future of his countrySTORY HIGHLIGHTSMacedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski talks to CNN's Nic RobertsonGruevski, leader of the center-right VMRO-DPMNE party, has been prime minister since July 2006His priorities are economic revival, job creation and joining the European Union
RELATED TOPICS

European Union
NATO
Greece
Skopje, Macedonia (CNN) -- Macedonia's prime minister has said the country is seeking a compromise with Greece over the long-standing name dispute between both countries. In an interview with CNN, Nikola Gruevski said he was trying to reach a solution with Greece over the issue so his country could gain membership into the European Union. He told CNN: "We said to Greece, 'We want to make a compromise. We want to find solutions,' so we can become a member of NATO and the EU. Compromise means both sides make moves, not just one side to make concessions and the other side to have a victory." Macedonia has been at loggerheads over its name for 17 years with Greece, which blocked its entry to NATO in 2008 over the dispute. Greece claims that the name "Macedonia" implies territorial ambitions on the Greek province of the same name. Macedonia denies it. The two countries have taken their dispute to the International Court of Justice. Gruevski also spoke to CNN about his country's economy, their ongoing efforts to gain membership of the European Union and the wine industry. CNN: What is the state of your economy right now? Nikola Gruevski: Last year, the World Bank announced that Macedonia was the third biggest reformer in the world for creating a good business climate. And it's helping. Unfortunately, last year the world was in crisis. The amount of investment was reduced. But now there are new signals, new investors. CNN: We saw in the center of the city a demo of people protesting for jobs. How big an issue is unemployment? NG: Unemployment is a serious issue in Macedonia. Before independence, our companies produced for 22 million people in former Yugoslavia. Immediately after that, the market was much smaller and the managers didn't find good ways to open new markets. That created serious unemployment. It's declined in the last three years. CNN: What would it mean for Macedonia to be part of the European Union and NATO? NG: Politically, for us, it's very important to be a member of the EU and NATO. More than 90 percent of the citizens would like to see Macedonia in NATO and the EU. We fulfilled all necessary criteria to receive invitation for full membership to NATO in March 2008. Because of Greece, because of the name issue that they opened, our invitation was postponed. In the meantime we're trying to work with Greece to find some solution for the problem. CNN: What exactly is Greece saying? NG: Greece wants our name to be changed, the new name to be given by them. They have a few names that they prefer, and they're asking us to accept these names. CNN: And one of them is Northern Macedonia? NG: Yes. And a second thing, which is very unreasonable, they want to change the identity of the citizens. That's very difficult to explain, but they want the government to accept and to explain to the citizens, that our language and nationality, in the future will not be Macedonian, but will be something else. We said to Greece, 'We want to make a compromise. We want to find solutions,' so we become a member of NATO, member of the EU.Compromise means both sides make moves, not just one side to make concessions and the other side to have a victory. Fortunately, in the meantime, the companies don't care about the name issue. Greece is one of the biggest investors in Macedonia and our citizens are regularly going there for tourism. See Macedonia's stunning scenery CNN: People think of Alexander the Great as coming from Macedonia. What is at the heart of being Macedonian? NG: Alexander the Great's empire was 2,300 years ago. The empire was very big and had different parts. And today these places are many countries, so I think he's a person who belongs to the world, not to Greece or Macedonia or India. So, we don't like to monopolize history. Unfortunately the other side is insisting on monopolizing the history. They are saying, "This is just our history." CNN: In May, you're going to take over the presidency of the European Council of Ministers. What do you hope to achieve in your six months of presidency? NG: Macedonian presidency will be important for making many steps, making some reforms. It will also be a chance for us to make some cultural events and to improve our image as a country. There'll be good chances for many meetings, representing the country in different situations. CNN: Is the government going to invest in tourism in the future? NG: We have plans for new investments in tourism in different parts of the country. The most popular place for tourism in Macedonia is Ohrid. But also, there are other mountains, lakes, and archaeological places. We have also very good monasteries and temples which really are attractive for tourists. CNN: And wine as well? NG: We produce very good wine. Very close to the best wines in the world. When I'm drinking wine, I always choose Macedonian. Creating Napa valley in California CNN: What does Macedonia have that allows it to produce such good wine? NG: Tradition. Production of wine in Macedonia dates from 6,000 years ago, and for centuries it has improved. But it's still not very well promoted. We have a lot of work to do on promotion, distribution and producing large enough quantities for the large companies. But we are working on this and every year we are increasing production.

Heat pops pipes nationwide; brace for higher bills By Thom Patterson, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSHeat wave blamed for water pipeline bursts from California to New YorkExperts: It's a sign that sweeping replacement is needed for U.S. water pipelinesCost of new water infrastructure $334 billion through 2027, EPA says Many U.S. utilities are already requesting rate increases to pay for new pipelines (CNN) -- Critical water pipelines are breaking from coast to coast, triggered by this summer's record high temperatures. It's not a phenomenon or coincidence, experts say. It's a clear sign that Americans should brace for more water interruptions, accompanied by skyrocketing water bills. The heat wave of the past few weeks has burst hundreds of crucial pipes in California, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Indiana, Kentucky and New York, temporarily shutting off water to countless consumers just when they needed it most. "It's one of the worst summers," said Debbie Ragan of Oklahoma City's Utilities Department. As days of 100 degree-plus temperatures bake the region, the utility reports 685 water main breaks since July alone. That's an estimated rate of four times normal. To keep up with repairs, Ragan said, workers have been putting in 12-to 16-hour shifts 24/7. "It's the heat and the high water usage," Ragan said. High temperatures can dry soil so that it shrinks away from buried pipes. Increased water usage raises pressure inside the water lines. Both factors add strain to pipeline walls, making older pipes more susceptible to bursting. H20 bills: How does your city rank?

Water wars: Bills rise to the thousands
It underscores the fact that much of the nation's underground water lines are 80 to 100 years old -- and approaching the end of their lives. Experts call it America's "Replacement Era," when hundreds of water utilities nationwide will be forced to replace their aging infrastructure -- or suffer the consequences. Who will probably have to pay for those hundreds of thousands of miles of new pipelines? Utility customers, industry experts say. Water rates ranked for 50 cities For towns like Kemp, Texas, population 1,150, the situation reached emergency levels this week. A historic drought throughout Texas has left Kemp with what Mayor Donald Kile described as "cracks so big in the ground, you could lose a small dog in them." Fourteen major water line breaks August 7 emptied water towers and forced Kemp to shut off water service until Tuesday, officials said. The mayor blamed the crisis on 80-year-old pipelines and high demand as temperatures rose above 100 degrees for 37 straight days. Texas town turns off water, leaving residents boiling mad It's even worse in the Texas town of Robert Lee. The hellish heat has left its entire reservoir dry as a bone. Community leaders are considering trucking water in from elsewhere or laying a 12-mile pipeline to connect to water in a nearby town. Get ready for more of the same, environmentalists say. Shifting climate change in the coming decades, they warn, will probably bring more droughts, record high temperatures and other weather conditions that will damage water infrastructure. Texas town threatened by dried-out reservoir Options to ensure water for small towns like these are few and expensive, ranging from building larger reservoirs to connecting their water systems to utilities in nearby areas. I don't see that there's any way, other than rate increases for most cities given the size of the financial need.--George Hawkins, D.C. Water and Sewer
"That kind of interconnection might be life-saving for that community," said Tom Curtis of the American Water Works Association. But the expense of laying miles of pipe may be too much for many utilities to handle. Town turns sewer water into drinking water Three facts hammer home the scary status of the nation's water infrastructure: • The nation averages about 700 water main breaks nationwide each day, according to the EPA. • U.S. water utilities lose an average of about 10% of their water -- worth $2.8 billion per year -- through leaks and other causes, according the EPA. • The American Society of Civil Engineers grades the water infrastructure at a D minus. "We've gotten so good at capturing and transporting water that we've really started to take it for granted," said Alex Prud'homme, author of "The Ripple Effect," about the nation's declining water infrastructure. "We had better start looking ahead and repairing our water infrastructure, because with the pressure from climate change, population growth, shifting demographics and the way we use water, the problem is only going to get worse rather than better." Skyrocketing water bills mystify, anger residents Searching for answers with technology Inside a control room in the nation's capital, not far from the Potomac River, experts are hoping technology will solve this problem. The National Water BillThe United States uses more than 408 billion gallons of drinking water daily.
Estimated cost of U.S. drinking water infrastructure improvments from 2007 to 2027: $334 billion The U.S.drinking water infrastructure totals more than 700,000 miles. That's more than four times the length of the National Highway System. Sources: EPA, American Water Works Association
The room is filled with multiple monitors displaying brightly colored graphs. "It looks like we should be launching rockets into space," said George Hawkins, general manager of Washington, D.C.'s Water and Sewer Authority. The room helps stand guard over the city's 13,000 miles of water pipes and 42,000 valves. Strategically placed sensors detect leaks ranging from a trickle to full-blown water main bursts. Data about the breach are sent from these sensors to the control room, and technicians respond immediately. This allows the utility to more quickly and easily identify aging pipes and valves before they blow. "The highest cost we face is digging up the street on an emergency basis any time of day or night -- often overtime," Hawkins said. The cost of replacing these aging systems is stunning. Hawkins recalls a major water main break last year along the National Mall that flooded parts of buildings housing the Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department. The burst pipe buckled Constitution Avenue by about a foot and cost almost $1 million in repairs and restoration. Smart water meters have slashed monthly meter readings from $3 per customer to just pennies. When these meters show a spike in customer's water use, the utility sends an e-mail to alert customers that they may have a leak. The technology is credited with cutting water leaks from 36 percent to 22 percent, saving customers even more. "Quadruple hit" The Replacement Era is going to be expensive. The EPA estimated that between 2007 and 2027, drinking water utilities will have to invest $334 billion on new infrastructure. The problem is worsened by the timing of it all. There's budget-cutting talk at the local, state and federal level. Hawkins called it a "quadruple hit." "I don't see that there's any way, other than rate increases for most cities given the size of the financial need," Hawkins said. "If we're not able in parallel to demonstrate how we're efficiently using the dollars we're collecting, I think this industry is in for huge challenges with our customers." Water officials in Pittsburgh are considering raising rates more than 13% for infrastructure improvements. In Cleveland, authorities increased water fees for the same reason. Leaders in Baltimore took similar action. "With this increase, we can either stop drinking water, stop showering, stop doing the laundry or get out of the city," complained a reader on CNN affiliate WBAL's website. "The mayor and City Council need to realize that we along with other homeowners are the tax base, and if we leave, they're up the creek!" In Southern California, Los Angeles water officials are thinking about raising rates to replace thousands of miles of decaying water pipes. The city of Indianapolis is trying something different. Hoping to save yearly operating costs by combining utilities, the city shifted control of its water and sewer system to a not-for-profit trust that also runs the local natural gas. It will free up $425 million in city funds that could be used for other expenses. "Taxpayers have been unwilling to look at the long-term," Prud'homme said. "But taxes and water rates go to maintaining this very important infrastructure that we take for granted, and if you're not willing to pay those fees and taxes, then you'll eventually suffer the consequences." National water dialogue Those consequences, some warn, include shifting weather patterns due to global climate change. Hotter summers and fluctuating water levels in lakes and oceans due to climate change will damage water and sewer systems in the coming decades, according to a new report from the Natural Resources Defense Council. "I'm not hearing any outrage," Prud'homme said. "I kind of feel like the crazy person on the roof yelling and shouting and saying, 'hey, everybody we've got to wake up and pay attention to this,' especially when it comes to our dams and levees." In a year that has seen historic flooding in several Midwestern and Southern states along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, Prud'homme says, he thought the levee failures during Hurricane Katrina would have prompted more alarm about flood defenses. "More than 100 levees are at risk of catastrophic failure," he said. "And this is from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers." Prud'homme fears that U.S. water issues are so threatening, sweeping policy changes are needed. He's calling for a national dialogue focusing on water infrastructure issues. "We have no single federal office that's overseeing the nation's water supply," Prud'homme said. "There aren't really any easy answers to this, but these are issues that we have to tackle."

Libyan rebels launch assault close to Tripoli By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebel fighters flash the victory sign as they drive to the frontline on June 11. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: NATO warplanes targeted military refueling equipment near Brega14 rebels die in Misrata fightingRebels capture Al-Qawalish, according to a rebel fighterThe town is about 30 miles southwest of Tripoli Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels marched toward Tripoli Wednesday, capturing a town southwest of the capital from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces, a rebel fighter told CNN. Fighting also engulfed Misrata, east of Tripoli, where 14 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded, according to Mohamed Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman in the city. Three civilians also died in rocket attacks launched by Gadhafi's men, Ibrahim said. CNN could not verify the information. Just west of Misrata, in Dafniya, 14 rebel fighters were killed and 42 were wounded Wednesday during a firefight with Gadhafi forces, said Ibrahim. Clinton: Gadhafi should step down

The rebels ran over Al-Qawalish, a town of about 4,000 residents 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Tripoli, a stronghold for Gadhafi since the start of the uprising in February. Their attacks got under way around 7 a.m. from the north, the west and the south. On the western front, journalist David Adams said rebels were using Grad launchers, two Russian tanks and a number of other vehicles, rockets and guns. The rebels captured the town around 2:30 p.m., entering from all three fronts, some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces. Some rebel fighters could be seen breaking windows, shooting doors of houses and rummaging through families' belongings. Some said they were looking for weapons, but they appeared to be looting. After they had lost control of the town, Gadhafi forces began shelling its periphery with Grad rockets. At least 12 government soldiers died, six were wounded and seven were captured, said Adams. Rebels, whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded, said their next target would be Al Assabiah, said Adams. Hassan Al-Jiwali, a rebel fighter from the Nafusa Mountains, said 50 of Gadhafi's men were killed and 15 were captured in the offensive. Fighting has erupted in the western mountains in recent weeks as more than four months of battles have failed to yield a decisive victory for either side. The first United Nations joint mission to reach the devastated mountain region found many people in dire need of food. A World Food Programme statement said markets were not functioning due to limited fuel and cash, and basic services such as electricity and water were lacking in some areas. The rebels said they were moving northward, closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea. They intended to march to the city of Garyan, which sits on the main highway to Tripoli. Also Wednesday, NATO said its air forces targeted military re-fueling equipment in the Brega area southwest of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. "These precision strikes will limit the ability of pro-Gadhafi forces to threaten Libyan civilians and significantly degrade logistical support for Gadhafi's campaign in eastern Libya," said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of Operation Unified Protector, in a news release. France has acknowledged arming the rebels, saying the weapons were for self-defense. However, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said Tuesday the weapons were no longer necessary because the rebels were becoming "more autonomous." But debate continued over France's decisions. In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia argued that, by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya. CNN's Kareem Khadder and Kathryn Tancos contributed to this report.

Apparently This Matters: R.I.P., 'Gangnam Style'
By Jarrett Bellini, CNN
updated 12:58 PM EDT, Mon October 15, 2012 | Filed under: Web
If you're sick of viral-video smash "Gangnam Style," blame this guy, South Korean pop star Psy.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
I hereby declare October 12, 2012, as the day "Gangnam Style" died
The last straw was when I came upon yet another trending video of a group dance to this song
We've long since rid ourselves of "Macarena," so we say can goodbye to "Gangnam Style"?
Editor's note: Each week in "Apparently This Matters," CNN's Jarrett Bellini applies his warped sensibilities to trending topics in social media and random items of interest on the interwebs. (CNN) -- It was cute for a while. We had some fun. And a few Americans even learned to locate South Korea on a map. (I think it's near Pittsburgh.)
But now it's time for all of us to come together and stop the madness. Thus, let it be known that I hereby declare October 12, 2012, as the day "Gangnam Style" died.
Sorry, folks. We're done. It's officially no longer a thing. Psy seems like a really good dude, and I hate to have done this to his song, but this morning I slowly walked "Gangnam Style" out into the backyard, thanked it for the good times and shot it.
"Oppa is Old Yeller style!"
K-Pop star PSY: My video's more popular than me!
"Apparently This Matters" Is Jarrett Bellini's weekly (and somewhat random) look at social-media trends.
The last straw came for me when I was searching the Web for interesting writing topics and stumbled upon yet another trending video of a group dance using this song. Too many people thought this mattered, and I just couldn't take it. Right then and there, I experienced what some people in the medical community might describe as a mild freakout. So, let me just give a big thanks to the random stranger who pulled my shaking, half-naked body out of the storm gutter near my house.
Actually, that was last week and totally unrelated. But, nevertheless, thanks.
iReport: Gangnam style from Pittsburg State University
Now, before I go any further, I probably need to stop and explain "Gangnam Style" to my mom and dad, who, at this moment, are completely lost.
Gangnam Style, A Hit in the Sports World
Rapper Psy brings 'Gangnam Style' to U.S.
Inmates dance 'Gangnam Style'
Rapper living 'Gangnam style' goes viral
"Honey, do you have any idea what Jarrett's talking about?"
"Shhhh. Golf Channel."
Basically, Mom and Dad, "Gangnam Style" is a fun, catchy pop song by South Korean artist Psy. The official music video debuted on YouTube on July 15, went crazy viral and has since earned more than 430 million views.
That said, dear parents, "Gangnam Style" is more than just a song. It's also a dance (sort of) whose main signature move can best be described as riding a horse or, perhaps, fornicating with a kangaroo. So, you know, enjoy that little visual, and I'll see you at Thanksgiving.
As for the title: It actually refers to a posh district in Seoul where people are considered trendy and lavish, and the video colorfully exaggerates this uber-affluent lifestyle. In other words, one might say Beverly Hills is Gangnam Style. T.J. Maxx is not.
(Though there does appear to be a T.J. Maxx in Beverly Hills, Michigan. Discuss.)
For historical comparison, at least in my lifetime, I suppose the closest thing we've ever had to "Gangnam Style" was "Macarena" by Los del Rio. While the song "Macarena" -- and its signature dance, THE Macarena -- didn't enjoy the luxury of YouTube, it did somehow manage to become an international sensation in the mid-'90s. If you were at a party or a sporting event or (seriously) even the Democratic National Convention, you were (by penalty of death) required to dance the Macarena. And to this day, I still know it by heart.
North Korean video evokes 'Gangnam Style' to taunt South Korean candidate
Mind you, I can barely remember what I was doing 30 seconds ago, but even after more than 15 years, I absolutely, positively recall every last move of the Macarena.
Just to be sure, I demonstrated it for our 23-year-old intern and then asked if she'd like me to teach it to her.
Her wise response: "Do I have to?"
So we've long since rid ourselves of "Macarena," and now we say goodbye to "Gangnam Style." They're not a perfect comparison, for as best as I can tell, "Gangnam Style" isn't necessarily a fully composed dance but more of a song that features several signature dance moves. I already described the main one, and the other biggie looks like some sort of crazed, hyper-animated version of the Axl Rose. Well, at least from back in the day when the Guns 'n Roses frontman didn't have to move around stage on a Rascal.
The point is this: "Gangnam Style" is officially dead.
True, the U.N. didn't grant me absolute authority to murder it in the backyard, but I assure you it's taken care of. So, no more group dancing. No more stadium JumboTrons. No more Internet parodies. It's done. Alas, I wish this old boy could've been put out to stud, but for the safety of future generations, "Gangnam Style" simply had to die.
It won't see you at Thanksgiving.

With river blindness, 'you never sleep'
By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
updated 9:17 AM EST, Sat February 2, 2013
James Waya, 67, lives in North Liwa Village, Uganda. Waya suffers from leopard skin, which affects many people with river blindness. Thanks to The Carter Center and its partners, including the national river blindness program, James has been receiving ivermectin treatment for more than seven years and no longer experiences the intense itching and other ill effects associated with the disease. Leopard skin is one symptom of river blindness. The more infected black fly bites a person receives, the more severe the illness becomes. Okello Noel, 18, lives in Kibega Villiage, in Pader District, Uganda. He lost his sight in 2007. The Carter Center's River Blindness Program now assists the country's Ministry of Health in providing mass drug distribution in Noel's community so that future generations will not suffer from impaired vision caused by river blindness. Community drug distributors provide doses of the drug ivermectin for free in river blindness endemic areas. The correct dosage is determined by the patient's height. Mass drug distribution is a key component of the drive to eliminate the blinding disease throughout Uganda.
Black flies are collected by community members who use themselves as bait. Thousands of black flies are brought to the Carter Center-supported lab each year. Each sample collection contains a paper with the month, region, place of collection and species. The flies are tested to see if they contain DNA from the river blindness parasite, an indication of the presence of the disease. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Carter Center in Atlanta leading an effort to eliminate river blindness in several countries
Some strains cause blindness, while others come with more severe skin disease
Uganda has a goal of eliminating the disease by 2020
(CNN) -- The machete blades turned red with heat in the fire that the rubber workers built on a Liberia plantation, Thomas Unnasch remembers from a visit in the 1980s.
This was how the men tried to quell the intense itchiness that comes with river blindness, a rare tropical disease.
"You can imagine how bad the itching must be, that running a red-hot machete up and down your back would be a relief, but it was," said Unnasch, whose laboratory works on diagnostic tests for the disease.
About 18 million people have river blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, but more than 99% of cases of this disease are found in Africa. It goes by the technical name "onchocerciasis," and it spreads through small black flies that breed in fast-flowing, highly oxygenated waters. When an infected fly bites a person, it drops worm larvae in the skin, which can then grow and reproduce in the body.
Unlike malaria, river blindness is not fatal, but it causes a "miserable life," said Moses Katabarwa, senior epidemiologist for the Atlanta-based Carter Center's River Blindness Program, which has been leading an effort to eliminate the disease in the Americas and several African countries.
Some strains cause blindness, while others come with more severe skin disease. With time, generally all strains of the disease can lead to rough "lizard" skin, depigmented "leopard skin" and hanging groins. Another big problem among patients is itching, which happens when the worms die inside a person.
In southwest Uganda, the locals call the disease "Obukamba," referring to the symptoms of distorted skin appearance and itchiness, Katabarwa said. In western Uganda, he said, "the fly is called 'Embwa fly' or dog fly, for it bites like a dog!"
There is no vaccine for river blindness, but there is a drug, called ivermectin that paralyzes and kills the offspring of adult worms, according to the Mayo Clinic. It may also slow the reproduction of adult female worms, so there are fewer of them in the skin, blood and eyes. The pharmaceutical company Merck has been donating the treatment, under the brand name Mectizan, since 1985.
Elimination efforts
Great strides have been made against this disease. In the Americas, it was eliminated in Colombia in 2007 and in Ecuador in 2009.
The biggest area of concern is Africa. In 1995 the African Programme for Ocnhocerciasis Control was founded by a group of nongovernmental organizations, governments, and United Nations agencies, with the World Health Organization overseeing it.
The APOC partnership, which includes the Carter Center, has given out 500 million ivermectin treatments between 1995 and 2010, according to a new study in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.
Rare tropical disease close to eradication
Dr. Moses Katabarwa inspects a fast moving stream of the type where the black flies breed.
The organizations and governments involved in APOC have collectively avoided 8.2 million years of life that would have been lost to unhealthiness as a result of this disease from 1995 to 2010, the study said.
The study projected that APOC's impact will be even greater from 2011 to 2015, avoiding 9.2 million years of life that would have otherwise been lived in agony from this disease.
In Uganda, Katabarwa's home country, the country's goal is to eliminate the disease by 2020. The Ministry of Health and the Carter Center, partners of APOC, are working toward making that happen.
Instead of the standard ivermectin treatment of once a year, Katabarwa and colleagues have been working on distribution every six months. More frequent treatments eliminate more baby worms and reduce the reproductive capacity of the adult female worms inside patients' bodies, Katabarwa said.
Where possible, they are also treating fast-flowing waters with a biodegradable insecticide called Abate to wipe out the larvae of the infectious black fly population. And they are training local populations to give out the medicine and keep track of who has been treated.
'You never sleep'
It can't be overstated that the worms itch, a lot. Sometimes, said Unnasch, people infected with the worms are driven to suicide.
Katabarwa also has stories of people inflicting harm upon themselves because of the itchiness. There are cases where people boil water to pour on themselves, he said.
"You scratch yourself until you damage your skin," Katabarwa explains. This leads to other health problems: The scratch marks bleed, making you more prone to bacterial infections. Children with the worms can't concentrate because they are scratching themselves all day and night.
"You never sleep," Katabarwa said. "Some people use a clay pot and break it to scratch themselves because the nails are not enough."
Relief from itchiness comes with the ivermectin -- even for someone who has lived with the disease for more than 50 years, he said. By taking the drug frequently, the skin can partly heal.
Unfortunately, for patients who lose all sight, blindness is irreversible because the optic nerve is damaged. Skin that has hardened, sometimes to the point where needles can't penetrate it, will not reverse itself, either.
The side effects from the medicine can also be nasty: Ivermectin may cause fever, itching, skin rash, joint or muscle pain, rapid heartbeat, and painful, tender glands. Less common side effects include headache and swelling of a person's hands, feet, legs, face or arms. A person can also suffer a serious allergic reaction from it, so health workers bring antihistamines.
"If your immune system is very efficient, it will try to attack the dead worms" that the medicine kills, Katabarwa explained. "The itchiness that will be triggered is incredible. It happens within 10 minutes."
But most of the reaction subsides after two days. During that time, other biting insects such as mosquitoes, lice and bedbugs also die if they attempt to bite the treated patient.
Guinea worm a greater challenge than smallpox
Because of the observed benefits of treating river blindness, infected people agree to take the medication despite the side effects, Katabarwa said.
"When people see you with that skin, they don't want to be near you," Katabarwa said.
How disease creates outcasts
One patient who made a big impression on Katabarwa was Semanza from the Rukungiri district of Uganda. In 1992, Semanza's skin looked like it was covered in dried mud, and flies swarmed around him. No one from his village wanted to be near him and he lived in a hut behind his family's home, separated from everyone else.
"He was really forgotten," Katabarwa said. Semanza's skin was so thick, because of river blindness, that it could break a needle.
Katabarwa told the local health workers to give Semanza a dose of ivermectin every three months, which is more often than the standard distribution.
Years later, when Katabarwa visited again, a man approached him and hugged him, smiling. "Who are you?" Katabarwa asked. It was Semanza. Two years later, they reunited again, and Semanza revealed that he had married and wanted many children.
Katabarwa also remembers educating a particular community in northwest Uganda in 1993, which had all the right conditions for black flies that transmit river blindness to breed.
A group of women in the community told Katabarwa that because of river blindness, people from surrounding areas did not want to marry anyone from their village. As a result, marriages had to happen within the community, including among relatives. Incest was strictly forbidden in their culture, but because of river blindness, it happened quietly, Katabarwa said.
When Katabarwa returned five years later, the skin of infected individuals had greatly improved, and marriages with outsiders were happening again.
"These are stories of sadness, but after a few years there is hope," Katabarwa said.
Empowering populations Katabarwa has taken the approach of making use of Ugandan villages' kinship structures to assist with health care.
People in villages often live on the land that belonged to their families several generations back, and do not move away in adulthood. This means that cousins live near each other, too, and will help with care for family members who are absent when health workers visit.
It is easier and more efficient to distribute medications when tapping into these large family structures, Katabarwa said. Through this approach, many more women have joined the effort to distribute the medicines because they are comfortable working among their family members.
Toward elimination Elimination in 2020 is the goal for Uganda, but river blindness is harder to control in some parts of the country because of environmental and political factors, Unnasch said.
There are places where insecticide resistance is a problem with a particular species of black fly that also moves around a lot, he said, especially on the border with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Doing any kind of river blindness control in Democratic Republic of the Congo is problematic because of safety issues, he said. A lack of government structure also makes it hard for health workers to coordinate efforts. But the flies don't respect the border between DRC and Uganda, and people belonging to the same tribe in both countries migrate across, too.
"If you're controlling it on the Ugandan side, and doing nothing on the DRC side," Unnasch said, "you're never going to really eliminate it until you deal with these cross-border issues, and get an effective program going."
Unnasch commended the work that the Carter Center has been doing. He and Katabarwa travel together to Uganda every year. They are both part of an expert committee on river blindness through the country's Ministry of Health.
"When summertime rolls around, and the rains start to come and the flies go out, that's when we need to be there," Unnasch said.

Arkansas man charged in connection with power grid sabotage
By Chelsea J. Carter, CNN
updated 10:48 PM EDT, Sat October 12, 2013
Authorities say a tractor was used to cut down two electric poles near Cabot, Arkansas, on October 5.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jason Woodring, 37, was arrested Saturday by federal authorities
Woodring is accused of carrying out three attacks on the grid over three months, authorities say
He is expected to make his first court appearance on Tuesday
(CNN) -- A Jacksonville, Arkansas, man has been charged in connection with attacks on the power grid in a rural area of the state, the U.S. Justice Department said Saturday.
Jason Woodring, 37, was arrested on a federal criminal complaint charging him with destruction of an energy facility, the Justice Department said.
Woodring is accused of carrying out multiple acts of sabotage, targeting high-voltage power lines and a substation over a period of months, that knocked out power to thousands, the agency said.
Woodring was arrested Saturday after authorities found evidence similar to those used at one of the sabotage sites, authorities said.
"Interviews were conducted and information from these interviews was connected to previous grid attacks resulting in the arrest of Woodring," according to a statement released by the the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Woodring is expected to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.
Federal authorities began investigating the reports of sabotage on August 21 after someone brought down one of multistate utility Entergy's high-voltage transmission lines in Cabot.
That was followed by fire set at a control house at a substation in Keo, about 25 miles south of Cabot, on September 29, the FBI said.
The FBI has said investigators suggested the perpetrator in the August attack had "above-average" electrical skills.
In the August incident, someone attempted to use a cable to catch a moving train to bring down the tower, Entergy spokeswoman Julie Muntsell said. The perpetrator also removed bolts from the base of the 100-foot tower, contributing to its downfall, she said.
In the substation fire, the suspected arsonist left behind a message: "You should have expected U.S." was inscribed on a control panel, the bureau reported.
The FBI said removing bolts from the tower "would have created substantial noise" during the early-morning incident, the FBI said in a written statement.
On October 5, power was knocked out to thousands of people after someone cut into, then used a tractor to pull down, two electrical poles in Cabot. The power lines were owned by First Electric Cooperative.
CNN's Scott Thompson and Matt Smith contributed to this report.

U.S. man in hot water in Dubai over parody video
By Shawn Nottingham and Mariano Castillo, CNN
updated 10:26 AM EST, Thu December 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
An American citizen is imprisoned in UAE
His family says he's facing charges for a parody video he made
Shez Cassim has been unable to be released on bail
His next hearing is December 16
(CNN) -- It was intended as a piece of comedy, but it's turned into a drama.
A young American living in the United Arab Emirates has been imprisoned since April, his family says, for posting what was intended to be a funny video on the Internet.
Now, the family of Shezanne "Shez" Cassim wants to bring attention to his case ahead of a hearing December 16.
The video in question is a 19-minute short that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens who are influenced by hip-hop culture. In the 1990s, the label "Satwa G" was coined for a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were.
Family speaks out over spoof video
Spoof video lands American in Dubai jail
The video depicts a look at a "combat school" in the suburb of Satwa, where these "gangsters" are trained. The training includes how to throw sandals at targets, using clothing accessories as whips, and how to call on the phone for backup.
"It's like someone in the U.S. making a parody video of a Brooklyn hipster and getting thrown in jail for it and being held in jail for months without bail," Cassim's brother, Shervon Cassim, told CNN affiliate KARE. "That's what's going on here."
Cassim's family says Shez, 29, has been charged with endangering national security, but they've not been told what about the video endangered security.
UAE authorities did not respond to CNN requests for details about what charges Cassim may be facing and why.
"It's just a straightforward silly comedy video. And he's being treated like some sort of dangerous criminal, high security criminal that they need to keep under maximum security conditions," Shervon Cassim told KARE about his brother.
Shez Cassim has lost a lot of weight, but is otherwise in good physical condition, his brother told CNN.
Cassim, from Woodbury, Minnesota, moved to Dubai in 2006 after graduating college to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Dubai lands Middle East's first World Expo He and some friends made and posted the video online in 2012. He was arrested in April 2013.
According to the family, Cassim and eight friends have been charged under a cybercrimes law for endangering public order. This law, the family says, wasn't passed until after the video had been released.
Two attempts by Cassim's lawyers to get him released on bail have been rejected.
The U.S. State Department is providing consular services to Cassim, a department official said, and has attended all his court hearings.
"The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General have engaged with UAE counterparts to urge a fair and expedient trial and judgment," the official said.
The Satwa G's, the family said in a statement, were known as wanna-be gangsters, and that's how Cassim portrayed them.
"These 'gangstas' were known for their decidedly mild behavior and were seen as the total opposite of actual criminals," the statement said. "The fictional training depicted in the video teaches techniques that include the best way to throw a sandal at a newspaper (target) and, ultimately, how to use the mobile phone when in trouble."
At the last hearing, the judge in the case asked for an Arabic translation of the video, giving the family some hope that the authorities will realize that it was a parody.
"I just want my son home for Christmas," said Cassim's mother, Jean Cassim, in a statement. "He's a good young man with a great career and has never been in trouble. Now he's being held for no reason. I've been praying, going to mass and lighting candles, and that's what I'm going to keep doing."
An average of about 2,500 Americans are jailed abroad every year, and about a third of those arrests are related to illegal drugs, the U.S. State Department says. "In 2010 alone, consular officers conducted more than 9,500 prison visits, and assisted more than 3,500 Americans who were arrested abroad," the State Department's website says.
Advice for U.S. citizens traveling abroad
U.S. travelers in foreign countries are subject to the laws of those countries, and there's a limit to how much help they can get from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate there.
U.S. diplomatic corps officials "cannot represent you in legal proceedings or pay your legal fees or other expenses. But they can perform many vital services such as providing a list of attorneys, assisting in contacting your family, helping your family to send money, and monitoring your health and welfare," the State Department says.
