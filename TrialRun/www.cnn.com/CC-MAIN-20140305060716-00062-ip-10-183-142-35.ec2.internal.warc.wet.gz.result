King children resolve battle; 'We still always loved one another' Story Highlights Children of slain civil rights leader decide to split contested money equally Settlement means siblings will avoid trial Bernice King, Martin Luther King III had accused brother of taking estate funds Dexter King, administrator of Martin Luther King Jr. estate, denied accusations Next Article in U.S. » ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The three surviving children of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. are moving forward after averting a public trial over the estates of their parents. Bernice King and her brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter King will split money they have been fighting over. The settlement among Bernice King, Martin Luther King III and Dexter King was announced after 11:30 p.m. Monday, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said. "We disagreed with each other, but we still always loved one another, and I think that's probably the most important factor," Martin Luther King III said. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit contended that Dexter King illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse his siblings' legal costs. The document does not say how much he was accused of taking. The suit also accused Dexter King of failing to provide timely accountings of their father's estate and said he hadn't given his siblings an accounting of finances in years. Dexter King denied the accusations. He said shareholder meetings had not been held in the past few years because of family deaths that disrupted normal routines. The Martin Luther King Jr. estate was also named as a defendant. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator. The three children are the only shareholders in the corporation. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King hold 20 percent of its outstanding shares. The two siblings also accused Dexter King of improperly removing money from the estate of their mother, Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. Don't Miss Judge troubled by King estate management
Martin Luther King children in court over estate case
However, Superior Court Judge Ural D. Glanville determined that Dexter King was an authorized signatory on the checking account for his mother's estate, which is administered by Bernice King. "There was no improper conduct with respect to the removal of funds from Mrs. King's estate," the court said in its order for summary judgment. The judge ordered that money withdrawn be equally divided among the siblings. "(It was a) very long day but also a very triumphant day in that we, as a family, I think, have amicably resolved our differences," Dexter King said. "Families love each other. Families have disagreements," Bernice King said. "It doesn't mean as we go forward we will always agree because that would be a misnomer to say that." The Kings have 14 days after the signing of Monday's settlement to each find three possible temporary custodians to manage the estate for at least one year. After the names are submitted to the court, the judge will make a choice, the settlement says. According to the settlement, the appointment of a custodian will give the three children time to heal their relationship as siblings, to develop procedures for managing the corporation that oversees the Martin Luther King Jr. estate and to assure third parties "as to the validity and enforceability of any agreements." One of the most bitter disagreements came over the private papers of Coretta Scott King. Dexter King accused his sister of withholding love letters between their parents that he wanted for a proposed $1.4 million book deal. The judge ordered that Coretta Scott King's papers be brought to Freedom Hall at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Atlanta, Georgia, for temporary storage. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. HIs oldest child, Yolanda, died in 2007.

Larry King's top 'Larry King' momentsBy Larry King, CNN The NAFTA debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot in 1993 reached more than 16.3 million viewers. STORY HIGHLIGHTS 'Larry King Live' is turning 25 Celebrate by picking your favorite show moments HERE Among Larry's favorite moments was the NAFTA debate, interviews with Sinatra and Brando

Larry King Live
Right now on CNN.com, viewers can vote for the top 5 moments in "Larry King Live" history, as part of the show's 25th anniversary celebration. Here, Larry weighs in with his own personal favorite shows from the past 25 years. (CNN) -- 1. The NAFTA debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot -- It's an obvious choice for me. It changed history. Bill Clinton called the next day to say that NAFTA never would have passed without that show. So all things considered, I chose this for its impact and importance -- it had the largest viewership in cable history at the time. So that's why it's my number one. 2. Frank Sinatra -- He is, in my opinion, the foremost entertainer of the 20th century. And one of the hardest gets to get. And it was his last interview as well as a great conversation. 3. Marlon Brando -- He, like Frank Sinatra, was impossible to get. I think Marlon Brando was the foremost actor of his time. And as with Sinatra, it was just an incredible interview. Plus, I got a kiss out of it! 4. Mideast Peace -- Such an important show. Having three leaders -- of Jordan, Israel and Palestine -- on at the same time had worldwide relevance. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It was worldwide diplomacy happening right there. How can you top that? 5. Ground Zero -- It was the worst thing to ever happen to the United States in modern history. Just getting to go there two weeks later, to walk among the rubble, to interview firemen and policemen, the first responders, to go to the burn center at the hospital, to see what happened up close -- it was living history. It is something I'll never forget.

Death toll rises to 361 in Pakistan flooding
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:48 AM EDT, Tue September 20, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
More deaths are reported from the flooding, officials say
About 600,000 people are living in refugee camps
The United Nations wants donations for flood relief efforts
(CNN) -- At least 361 people have died and 600,000 were living in refugee camps because of flooding in Pakistan, the country's national disaster authority said Tuesday.
The flooding in Sindh and Balochistan provinces has destroyed 1.5 million homes in 41,000 villages, the government said.
The United Nations World Food Program has been distributing food, starting in the hard-hit city of Badin. As of Friday, more than 15,000 people have received assistance, the agency said.
Villages, lives broken by Pakistan floods
The agency estimated that 73% of food crops in the flood zone and 36% of livestock were lost or destroyed.
The United Nations said Monday that it is seeking donors to build a $357 million fund to help the Pakistani government's flood response efforts.
It is meant to provide food, water, sanitation, health care and shelter for some flood victims for up to six months.
"More than five million people are struggling to survive massive flooding across southern Pakistan, and the rains continue to fall," said Valerie Amos, the U.N. under-secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
Last year, Pakistan was also the site of massive and deadly flooding.
In August 2010, weeks of flooding caused $9.7 billion in damages to homes, roads and farms in southwest Pakistan.
More than 1,700 people died in the 2010 flooding, and more than 20 million were displaced.
CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.

Frank Ocean effect: What happens when a hip hop artist confesses same sex love?
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
updated 2:56 PM EDT, Thu July 5, 2012
Frank Ocean performs at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival at The Empire Polo in Indio, California. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Singer Frank Ocean has gone public with his love for a man
Co-founder of Ocean's hip hop collective has been accused of homophobia
The singer is enjoying some high-profile support
(CNN) -- "Today is a big day for hip hop."
When music impresario Russell Simmons penned those words and posted them Wednesday, he was not referring to a new album dropping or the debut of an exciting artist. He was talking about a male artist's admission that his first love was a man.
"I am profoundly moved by the courage and honesty of Frank Ocean," Simmons wrote on the site Global Grind. "Your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear."
Ocean, an up-and-coming R&B singer, recently posted on his Tumblr that the summer he was 19 years old he fell in love with a man.
"We spent that summer, and the summer after, together," Ocean wrote. "Every day almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him, and his smile.
"Sleep I would often share with him," Ocean continued. "By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with."
The revelation is significant given that it is unheard of in hip hop for male performers to admit to anything other than hardcore heterosexuality and all of the bravado that comes along with many female conquests.
And Ocean is a member of the hip hop collective Odd Future, whose co-founder, Tyler the Creator, has been accused in the past of being homophobic and taken to task for his use of a gay slur in his lyrics. (According to online music magazine NME, Tyler the Creator used a derogatory term for gays or a variation of that term more than 200 times on his album "Goblin.")
But the rapper showed his support of Ocean via Twitter on Wednesday. He along with Simmons -- who as the co-founder of Def Jam Records and brother of Run DMC member Joseph Simmons is considered one of the founders of hip hop -- are not the only ones who hailed the singer for his openness.
Writer Dream Hampton wrote on Jay-Z's site Life & Times: "You shared one of the most intimate things that ever happened to you -- falling in love with someone who wasn't brave enough to love you back. Your relieving yourself of your secret is as much about wanting to honestly connect as it is about exhibition. We are all made better by your decision to share publicly."
Hampton noted that Ocean made his declaration the same week as the high-profile coming out of CNN reporter Anderson Cooper. And she touches on the accusations of homophobia that have long plagued hip hop, which has also taken shots for its misogyny.
"You're a Black man in America whose star is on the rise, working in hip-hop and soul, where gender constructs are cartoonishly fixed," Hampton wrote.
Terrance Dean, author of the 2008 book "Hiding in Hip-Hop: On the Downlow in the Entertainment Industry from Music to Hollywood," penned an open letter regarding Ocean.
"I actually have been awaiting the day, counting down the hours and minutes as to when one of my friends, or past lovers, would be brave enough to come forward and make a public announcement (My inhale continues to expand)," Dean said. "But, it wasn't one of them. No. It was someone younger. Much braver. An artist who isn't hindered by the old relics of Hip Hop, or the entertainment school of, 'Don't you come out or it will ruin your career,' and the record label politics."
So is hip hop ready to be more inclusive of LGBTs?
It's a question that is now being hotly debated.
The Los Angles Times called Ocean's reveal "undoubtedly the glass ceiling moment for music. Especially black music, which has long been in desperate need of a voice like Ocean's to break the layers of homophobia. "
In it's article "5 Things That Will Come Out of Frank Ocean's Coming Out" the site All Hip Hop predicted that "Hip-Hop will be forced to cool off on the homophobia. The fact is, Hip-Hop has had gay people in it for a very, very long time. That is a fact and far truer than people care to admit. But, somehow, unlike the rest of the world, the Urban Music world has been slow to accept homosexuality."

Massacre suspect's neighbor: 'I'm counting my lucky stars'
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:52 PM EDT, Sat July 21, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return Saturday night
A neighbor says she's glad she trusted her instinct and didn't open the suspect's door Agent: Anyone entering "would have sustained significant injuries or lost their life"
Police conducted a controlled detonation Saturday afternoon
Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Kaitlyn Fonzi put her hand on the doorknob of the apartment upstairs from hers around midnight Thursday, irritated by the blaring electronic music inside.
The upstairs neighbor didn't answer when she called through the door. He'd cranked up the stereo, the deep bass of the music reverberating through the floor into the apartment Fonzi shared with her boyfriend.
The door felt unlocked, but Fonzi decided not to open it.
"I yelled out and told him I was going to call the cops and went back to my apartment," she told CNN.
It's a move for which Fonzi said Saturday she's "counting my lucky stars."
"It makes me feel extremely grateful, and it's definitely made me thank God, too, and thank just my instinct," Fonzi said.
Behind that door, investigators say, was a tripwire that would have touched off an array explosives and flammable liquids in the home of Colorado massacre suspect James E. Holmes. Anyone who crossed that threshold "would have sustained significant injuries or lost their life," Jim Yacone, the head of the FBI's Denver office, told reporters Saturday afternoon.
Remembering the victims through photos
Holmes is being held as the suspect in the rampage at a nearby movie theater, accused of killing and wounding dozens at a screening of the new Batman film shortly after midnight Thursday. Investigators disarmed all the makeshift bombs he left inside his apartment on Saturday, using a "controlled detonation" to disable a second triggering device Saturday afternoon, said Sgt. Cassidee Carlson, an Aurora police spokeswoman.
Life and death choices inside the Aurora theater
"Although not certain, we are hopeful we have eliminated the remaining major threats," she said. "However, we will not know this until we enter the apartment."
Police evacuated Holmes' building and the four apartment blocks surrounding it after his arrest early Friday, when he told police he had rigged the flat with explosives. By 6 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), investigators had removed the remaining devices from the 850-square-foot apartment and hauled the explosives to an open field outside the city limits to be detonated, police said.
Residents of the surrounding buildings were allowed to return home Saturday evening, but it wasn't clear when Holmes' immediate neighbors could come back. It could be several days, Aurora Police Sgt. Tim Holt said. A shelter was set up at Aurora Central High School for those forced from their apartments.
Timeline of Colorado theater shooting
It was not clear where all the explosives had been placed, though many have been seen in the living area with circuitry reaching into the kitchen, a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the operation told CNN. One of the incendiary devices appeared to be improvised napalm and others appeared to be mixtures that, if combined with other materials, could cause an explosion, the official said.
"We talk about motive and defenses and deliberation, and make no mistake, this apartment was designed to kill whoever entered it," Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates said. And who was most likely to enter that location? "It was going to be an officer."
Tragic confirmations for families of victims
The apartment also contained about 30 aerial shells used in fireworks displays, roughly the size of golf balls and filled with black powder, wired to a control box in the kitchen that was defused with water, another law enforcement official said. There were also jars of black powder, liquid accelerants and other flammable chemicals in the apartment, the source said.
The music had been on a timer and apparently started after the suspect left for the theater, according to another law enforcement source, who was not authorized to release details of the investigation to the media.
Suspect bought over 6,000 rounds of ammunition
Fonzi said she called a non-emergency police number to complain about the noise after going to Holmes' door. A dispatcher told her they'd try to get an officer out to the apartment, but the noise kept up.
"I decided to call again a little bit before 1 o'clock, and they told me they were in an emergency state -- which I now know was the shooting -- and that they wouldn't be able to send anyone out there," she said.
iReporter: 'AK-47 a weapon for war'
The music stopped about 1 a.m. But within two hours, a SWAT team had kicked down the back door of the building and was banging on residents' doors, telling them to get out as soon as possible, she said.
Fonzi and her boyfriend have been staying with relatives since being evacuated. "We were considering moving prior to this, so maybe this is the push that we needed," she said.
Renewed debate over guns sparks after shooting
She said she had last seen Holmes "a few months ago, just in passing."
"This really has told me that things like this can happen no matter how safe you feel, and just to make sure that everyone you love knows it," she said. "Be thankful for what you have, and trust your inner instincts."
Were you there or do you have thoughts about the shooting? Let us know on CNN iReport.

Central African Republic president flees capital amid violence, official says
By Catherine E. Shoichet, Holly Yan and Nana Karikari-apau, CNN updated 4:03 AM EDT, Mon March 25, 2013
The Seleka rebel coalition launched its offensive in December, accusing President Francois Bozize of reneging on a peace deal .
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Rebel official: "The Central African Republic has just opened a new page in its history"

Rebels seize control of capital of Central African Republic, official says
President left Bangui via the Democratic Republic of Congo, an official says
(CNN) -- The president of the Central African Republic has fled the country's capital and rebels have seized control of the city, a government official said Sunday.
President Francois Bozize crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo, said Jules Gautier Ngbapo, a spokesman for the government's territorial administration minister. He declined to disclose Bozize's location Sunday.

"The Central African Republic has just opened a new page in its history," said a written statement from Justin Kombo Moustapha, secretary general of the Seleka rebels.
The statement described Bozize as the country's former president and urged residents of the landlocked country to remain calm and prepare themselves to welcome rebel forces.
Word of Bozize's surprise departure came as violence erupted in the capital, Bangui.

Witnesses reported hours of gunfire, and Ngbapo said at least seven civilians were killed as rebels and local residents looted shops.
Some South African soldiers were killed in clashes, according to a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande. South African officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
A United Nations spokeswoman based in Bangui described the situation as confusing and very tense.
"A number of U.N. offices have been looted as well as residences of some U.N. personnel," spokeswoman Uwolowulakana Ikavi said.
Sounds of fierce gunfire rang out for hours Sunday, she said.
The country has been on edge since rebel fighters pushed their way into the capital.
The wave of unrest started in December, when the Seleka rebel coalition launched its offensive. The rebels accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down.
The rebel group, based in the country's north, managed to take control of several towns and move toward Bangui in the following weeks.
The Seleka and the government brokered a new peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that peace deal also fell apart.
On Saturday, about 150 French troops secured the airport in Bangui.
France also asked for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address the crisis in its former colony.
Hollande's office said the French president had spoken Sunday with South African President Jacob Zuma, expressing condolences for the soldiers' deaths.
"They called on all the parties to be calm," the statement from Hollande's office said, "to stop looting and to respect the political accords of Libreville," where leaders signed a peace deal in January.

The African Union condemned the Seleka rebels' renewed offensive and also announced a travel ban and asset freeze against political and military actors involved in violating humanitarian rights or the January peace agreement.
Meanwhile, on Sunday, U.N. officials in the Central African Republic were preparing to evacuate.
U.N. staff on the ground in Bangui are not allowed to leave the compound, Ikavi said, and non-essential staff will be evacuated or relocated once the security situation allows.
"As a human being, I am afraid," Ikavi said. "No one can stay calm when you hear heavy shooting not far from the place that you are staying."

The trial dramatically concludes on Monday, August 26, as Bo accuses his former police chief Wang Lijun (pictured) of having a crush on his wife.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Court adjourns for the day and will resume Saturday
Bo describes his jailed wife as "insane" after watching her video testimony
The former top official has mounted a tough defense against bribery charges
An article in state-run media talks of Bo's "lying skills"
Jinan, China (CNN) -- Fallen Chinese Communist Party heavyweight Bo Xilai kept up his vigorous defense against corruption charges Friday in China's most politically sensitive trial in decades.
Bo's glittering career, in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery.
His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. It's taken more than a year, during which time the Communist Party underwent a major leadership change, to bring him to trial.
Timeline: Bo's fall from grace
China's 'trial of the century'
The mighty fall of Bo Xilai
The political impact of Bo Xilai's trial
Many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a preplanned script, seeing the trial's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between Bo and China's top leaders.
But as he often did in his political career, Bo has so far stolen the show, mounting a robust attack on the prosecution's case and ridiculing witnesses' testimony. That has left China watchers trying to figure out how far he's veered off script.
Bo calls wife 'insane'
He began his counterattack after the trial opened Thursday amid tight security in the eastern city of Jinan. He said he had made an earlier confession to party investigators "unwillingly" and described testimony by a former associate as "an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul."
He continued his offensive Friday, calling his imprisoned wife "insane" after the court was shown video testimony in which she implicated him in a murky property deal in the South of France.
Read: Tale of murder, corruption, betrayal
Bo, 64, is on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.
Journalists from the international news media haven't been allowed inside the courtroom. But the court's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside, attracting more than 350,000 followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service.
CNN hasn't been able to verify precisely how accurate and comprehensive the court's version of proceedings has been. But many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close, albeit filtered, account.
Court adjourned for the day Friday and will resume at 8:30 a.m. Saturday.
An 'eloquent' defense
Does Bo Xilai's trial matter in China?
Politician's supporters still pro-Bo Bo Xilai faces threat of death penalty
"In my view, Bo Xilai has decided not to cooperate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems," said Cheng Li, a China expert at the Brookings Institution.
The prosecutors were "terrible," Li said, while Bo was "clear, focused, articulate and eloquent."
His courtroom display appears to have been striking enough to prompt a personal attack against him on the website of the People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper.
"Bo Xilai's righteous and forceful performance in court makes one marvel at his superb acting and lying skills," the op-ed article said, citing an unidentified "media personality who attended the trial."
"His cunning arguments are only going to prove his extremely poor character and not going to help him evade punishment under law," the article quoted the person as saying.
Conviction still seen as likely
Although the effectiveness of Bo's performance so far doesn't mean the court will acquit him, it may make it tougher for it to mete out a heavy sentence.
The conviction rate for criminal trials and their appeals in China -- where the party controls police, prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report cited the Supreme People's Court as saying.
"Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous," Li said. "But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charge and how poorly they've conducted this trial."
It remains to be seen if the prosecutors' performance improves as the case continues.
China leaves nothing to chance for Bo Xilai 'trial of the century'
Flaws revealed
Much of the fallout from the Bo scandal came before the trial opened.
"The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse," Li said.
Members of the Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping, have described corruption as an existential threat to the Communist Party. But they have so far been reluctant to pursue it too aggressively.
Analysts say that is largely because it is so rampant.
Bo's case might have been a chance to make an example of a senior official. But his trial so far suggests that top leaders are unwilling to delve too deeply or punish him too severely.
"The leadership wants to move forward. They want to put it behind them and move onto other issues," Li said. "That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system."
A dramatic downfall
Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Mao Zedong and former leader Deng Xiaoping.
Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policymaking body of the Communist Party.
A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China.
But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February of last year and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was an accomplice in a murder case, a glittering political career began to unravel.
Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts.
A court found Gu guilty last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison.
The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence.
Dispute over a villa
Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal.
Authorities haven't said how long it will last. But with only part of the charges addressed so far, it appears it could go on for longer than the two days some observers had predicted.
Some of the testimony Friday concerned accusations that Bo was complicit in a complex deal Gu carried out to buy a villa in Cannes, France.
A dispute over ownership of the villa resulted in a falling out with Heywood, Gu said.
In her video testimony, Gu said that Bo was aware that the purchase of the villa had been funded by Xu Ming, a businessman in the northeastern port city of Dalian, where Bo was once mayor.
But Bo contested her accusation that he knew how the villa was paid for and poured scorn on her reliability as a witness.
"What's the credibility of Gu Kailai's testimony? She has changed, she is insane, and she often tells lies," he said. "She has been under severe pressure from the investigators to turn me in."
Three indictments
Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi ($3.6 million) in bribes from Xu and another Dalian businessman, Tang Xiaolin.
The embezzlement charge alleges that Bo and Gu transferred 5 million renminbi of public money from a construction project in Dalian to a private account through a law firm in Beijing.
And the abuse of power indictment relates to Bo's actions after he was informed about his wife's involvement in the killing of Heywood and Wang's attempted defection to the United States.

New team wanted to join Formula One in 2015 as FIA looks to expand
updated 1:14 PM EST, Thu December 12, 2013
The Caterham and Marussia teams have had an intense rivalry since joining Formula One in 2010.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Formula One is looking for a new team to join the grid
FIA has asked a prospective 12th team to register interest
New team could join the sport in either 2015 or 2016
Cost of applying to join F1 comes in at $130,000
(CNN) -- The search is on for a new team to join the elite racing ranks of the Formula One grid.
The sport's governing body, the FIA, has put out a call for "an expression of interest" for a 12th team to join the world championship for the start of the 2015 or 2016 season.
Any interested parties have until January 3 2014 to register their interest.
But before you start saving up your Christmas money, the FIA has already laid down detailed criteria, including an ability to stay in the championship until the flag falls on the 2020 season.
The organization is asking for the identity of prospective teams' shareholders, potential strategies and information about the candidate's experience in motor racing.

Read: F1 doubles up points for 2014 finale
If a potential competitor gets through the first round then the FIA will assess its technical ability, resources, funding, experience and the value it would bring to the F1 championship.
To underline how much money matters, teams must pay $5,000 to express their interest and a total of $130,000 to formally apply.
F1 last expanded the grid in 2010 when three new teams joined. Of the trio, two are still racing in their current guises -- Caterham and Marussia.
The Spanish Hispania (HRT) team withdrew from the sport at the end of 2012 because of financial difficulties.
New teams entering F1 often find it hard to close the gap on the midfield and front running teams.
Four time world champion team Red Bull Racing had two significant advantages when it was formed in 2005.
The financial Austrian energy drink company took over the established Jaguar team rather than starting from scratch and also arrived with significant independent funding.
Lawsuit looms
Meanwhile, Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone could face another lawsuit despite already defending cases on both sides of the Atlantic.
German media group Constantin Medien and U.S. company Bluewaters Communication Holdings are pursuing cases against Ecclestone surrounding the sale of F1 to private equity firm CVC in 2006.
German bank BayernLB confirmed Thursday that it also plans to start action against the British billionaire also in relation to the sale of his F1 business.
"We can confirm that BayernLB is working at high speed on civil charges against Mr Ecclestone and expects to file suit against him in High Court in London in January 2014," BayernLB told CNN in a statement.
Ecclestone was contacted by CNN but his spokeswoman did not wish to comment at this time.
