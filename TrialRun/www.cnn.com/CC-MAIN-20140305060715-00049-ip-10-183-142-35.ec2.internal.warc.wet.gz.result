Dozens of Capitol Hill protesters arrestedStory Highlights Nearly 60 protesters arrested near the U.S. Capitol Protesters target Iraq war, U.S. policy on global warming Police had warned protesters they would be arrested if they blocked entrances Next Article in Politics » From Paul Courson CNN	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Police on Monday arrested dozens of protesters who blocked the doors and streets outside congressional buildings near the U.S. Capitol. Nearly 60 were arrested on various charges, including unlawful assembly, said Sgt. Kimberly Schneider, spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol police. Police handcuffed a female protester dressed in a black pullover emblazoned with "Blackwater" and the U.S. security contractor's paw print symbol. "Step back, a member of Blackwater is being arrested," one of the woman's fellow protesters shouted, while others chanted, "Arrest Bush." Earlier, police had warned the protesters dressed in Blackwater gear, as well as others in military fatigues, not to block the doorway or they would be arrested. They sat on the steps pretending to hold weapons in their hands. More than 100 people were protesting both the war in Iraq and U.S. policy on global warming. Some were dressed as polar bears and danced on the sidewalk, while others shouted, "No war" and "No warming." Two protesters paraded through the streets outside the Capitol building, one wearing a large George W. Bush mask and a black-and-white prison outfit, while the other wore a Condoleezza Rice mask with an "Arrest Bush" T-shirt. E-mail to a friend All About U.S. Capitol

Somalia thanks Kenya after president's criticism
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 3:11 PM EDT, Wed October 26, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The U.S. did not encourage Kenya's actions, a U.S. Embassy official says
Somalia thanks Kenya for its cooperation Two days earlier, the Somali president criticized Kenya's sending in troops to fight Al-Shabaab
Kenya has said self-defense justifies crossing into Somalia
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Somalia praised Kenya Wednesday, thanking it for helping battle the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab, in an apparent effort to heal tensions sparked by the Somali president's criticism of Kenya earlier this week.
"Kenya and Somalia have a long history of friendship and cooperation, and that continues today," the Somali government said in what it called a "clarification statement."
It thanked Kenya for working together with the Somali transitional government "to stabilize Somalia" and for training a "good number of Somali soldiers as well as hosting (a) huge number of Somali refugees."
On Monday, Somali President Sharif Ahmed spoke out against Kenya's military incursion into his country, saying the African neighbor overstepped its bounds.
"To send forces into Somalia is not allowed by the government and the civilians," Ahmed said. He also called Kenya's actions "not good."
Wednesday's "clarification statement" did not clearly address the question of Kenyan troops entering Somalia. It said the two nations "share the attitude that Al-Shabaab constitutes a common enemy to both countries" and that "the territorial integrity of both Somalia and Kenya should be respected."
In order to "evolve a common security strategy, we agreed with our brothers" in the Kenyan government to cooperate in "coordinated security and military operations" spearheaded by Somali soldiers trained by Kenya, the statement said. There will also be "cooperation and collaboration in sharing and exchange of information that is relevant to the fight against cross-border crimes and operations."
Kenyan forces entered Somalia on October 15 in a strike on Al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group that Kenya blames for the recent kidnappings of foreigners from northern Kenya.
The Kenyan forces are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab. The United Nations estimates the group collects up to $50 million a year from businesses in Kismayo, about half of its annual income.
Kenyan officials declared self-defense justifies crossing the border with Somalia, saying a recent spate of kidnappings threatened its security and constituted an attack.
"If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try (to) hit wherever that enemy is," Kenyan Defense Minister Yusuf Haji said in a news conference Sunday.
Somalia's frail Transitional Federal Government, aided by forces from the African Union, has itself been fighting Al-Shabaab militants in the capital, Mogadishu, and reported last week that they had largely pushed the group out of that city.
Katya Thomas, a press officer with the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, said the United States "did not encourage the Kenyan government to act nor did Kenya seek our views. We note that Kenya has a right to defend itself against threats to its security and its citizens."
"The United States has supported Kenyan efforts to improve its ability to monitor and control often porous land and maritime borders and territory exploited by terrorists and illicit traffickers, particularly along its border with Somalia," Thomas said.
CNN's David McKenzie and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.

American Airlines loosens checked-bag restrictions for service members By the CNN Wire Staff American Airlines will allow military personnel to check up to five bags for free. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW:AirTran Airways waives bag fees for active-duty militarySoldiers back from Afghanistan said Delta charged their unit $2,800 to check extra bagsAmerican will go to five free checked bags for military personnel, up from three Delta and United/Continental announced bag-check policy changes on Wednesday (CNN) -- In the wake of an online video in which soldiers returning from Afghanistan complained that Delta Air Lines charged their unit more than $2,800 in bag-check fees, two rival carriers on Thursday said they will loosen their checked-bag restrictions for active-duty military members. American Airlines announced it will allow military personnel to check an extra two bags with no out-of-pocket expense, and AirTran Airways said later Thursday it will waive baggage charges for "members of the military who are traveling on active duty orders." The airline's policy is identical to that of Southwest Airlines, which acquired AirTran in a merger last September, AirTran spokesman Christopher White told CNN. American Airlines airline will have policy fully implemented "in the next few days," spokeswoman Dori Robau Alvarez said in a statement released Thursday. The airlines were the latest of the major U.S. carriers to change their policies. Delta and Continental/United announced Wednesday they were loosening their checked-bag policies for military personnel. Previously, American Airlines allowed three bags to be checked free, "with full government reimbursement to military personnel on any bags above that number," but the carrier decided to increase the free-bag limit to five, "given the potential confusion with different military units carrying different amounts of bags depending on their mission," according to the statement. The statement continued: "Both our revised 5-bag policy as well as the previous policy allowed active military personnel traveling either on orders or on personal travel to utilize our military bag policy. In addition, American also allows military personnel traveling on orders to have one of their free bags weigh up to 100 pounds and (to be) 126 linear inches in size without penalty. ... This greatly helps with the typical, large military duffel bags." Soldiers' $2,800 bag fees spark outrage
Its limits on other bags are 50 pounds and 62 linear inches, it said. AirTran's fee waiver also comes with some size and weight restrictions: "As long as each piece of baggage does not exceed 100 pounds in weight and 80 inches in size (length plus width plus height), you will be exempt from baggage charges, and will not be subject to excess, oversized, or overweight baggage charges," White said in an e-mail to CNN The Delta incident got instant notoriety after servicemen spoke out about their experience in a video posted on YouTube. In the clip, which the men say was recorded on board a Delta flight from Baltimore to Atlanta on Tuesday, a day after they returned from Afghanistan, the soldiers explain they had "a little issue with the bags." CNN affiliate WXIA in Atlanta identified the soldiers as U.S. Army Staff Sgts. Fred Hilliker and Robert O'Hair. The men, who were bound for Fort Polk, Louisiana, said their military travel orders allowed them to carry up to four bags, but when they arrived at the airport in Baltimore, Delta told them it allowed military personnel to check only three bags for free. Members of the unit who were traveling with four bags ended up paying out of pocket for their extra luggage, the soldiers said in the video. They were charged $200 per extra bag, so the 34-member unit ended up paying more than $2,800 in bag fees, the soldiers said. Any extra bag fees charged by an airline will be reimbursed by the government, a military spokeswoman told CNN affiliate WGCL in Atlanta. One of the soldiers in the video said the bag he had to pay for was a weapons case that contained "the tools that I used to protect myself and Afghan citizens while I was deployed in the country." The other man then looked into the camera, exasperated. "Good business model, Delta," he said sarcastically. "Not happy. Not happy at all," he added, shaking his head. On Wednesday, Delta changed its policy: Effective immediately, U.S. military personnel traveling on orders are now allowed to check up to four bags for free in coach and five bags in first class and business class. Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliot on Thursday said the airline will reimburse the complaining soldiers for any fourth-bag fees that the military will not cover, and is giving them travel vouchers good for future trips. United/Continental also announced Wednesday it will allow more bags. "United and Continental are waiving the fourth checked bag fee for military personnel traveling on orders in recognition of their sacrifice and service to our country," Christen David, a spokeswoman for United/Continental Airlines, said in an e-mail. The two airlines closed a merger deal in October. Delta said it deeply respects and admires men and women in uniform and added that it has worked hard to ensure that U.S. military personnel get "additional flexibility" when they travel on the carrier. The carrier said it's "continuing to work with the soldiers individually to make this situation right for each of them." The soldiers may have been misinformed about how many bags traveling active duty military personnel can check for free, according to Stars and Stripes, the independent news organization focusing on the military.CNN's A. Pawlowski and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.

Fear, despair as bailed out Cyprus faces uncertain future
By Carol Jordan, CNN
updated 10:39 AM EDT, Thu March 28, 2013
Philippos Philippou, an unemployed electrician, stands in line with his mother outside a bank in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, waiting for the bank to open after a 12-day lockdown on Thursday, March 28. After days of negotiation, Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to terms for a 10 billion euro bailout deal, which aims to prevent the collapse of Cypriot banks and ensure that Cyprus remains in the Eurozone. People waited impatiently for a Laiki bank branch to open March 28 after an 12-day lockdown in Nicosia, Cyprus.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Cyprus' banks reopen for first time in nearly two weeks
Cyprus agreed to allow big losses for large deposit holders in exchange for €10 billion bailout Young Cypriots see the bailout and its harsh terms as a threat to their future
Nicosia, Cyprus (CNN) -- "It is a jungle," the taxi driver told me. "It is a jungle and we are the rabbit surrounded by lions." It's a dramatic analogy, but one that accurately sums up Cypriots' disgust and helplessness at what they perceive to be the ultimate betrayal by the European Union.
The last two weeks have been the most dramatic in decades for Greek Cyprus, still reeling from the harsh terms of a €10 billion bailout from international lenders to save the island nation's banking sector. Large bank deposit holders are being forced to take huge losses, and unprecedented limits on the movement of cash have been imposed here.
LATEST: Cyprus' banks reopen for first time in two weeks
The prevailing mood is one of utter helplessness. Greek Cypriots are used to fighting. They fought Turkey for the very land they live on. But today there is no battle to fight against the nameless, faceless group of EU and International Monetary Fund bureaucrats and officials who have now become deeply involved in the future of their country.
Cyprus banks are back in business
Cyprus bailout lessons learned
Weber: Cyprus will be back for more
Cyprus: Template for future bailouts?
"We wanted to be Europe's friend," continues the driver, "but now it is turning on us."
It's difficult not to sympathize. Groups of locals sit in pavement cafes in the capital city of Nicosia, anxiously watching state television, waiting for the next move, waiting for the next development in a seismic event which has rocked the Cyprus economy to its very core. Every interview, every comment is being dissected assiduously.
MORE: Bitcoin currency surges post-Cyprus bailout
The biggest question this week was whether money would really be there when Cyprus' banks finally reopened Thursday. It is, but it can only be withdrawn €300 at a time. But Cypriots are also discussing and arguing about the long-term effects of the bailout. What does austerity mean? How come the Irish and the Spanish didn't lose their savings? Why us?
Walking down Nicosia's main shopping streets, there is little sign of an economic crisis. No queues at the ATMs. Restaurants are busy. Tourists are browsing through the many local stores. Heated discussions over Cypriot coffee can be heard everywhere, and although I can't understand the words, I can sense the frustration.
These people are stuck in a state of limbo. Journalists bandy the term "an uneasy calm" around quite a lot, but it seems a perfect fit to describe the mood here. What's the point in getting angry if you don't know what you're getting angry about? What can you say to the government when their hands are being forced by Europe? What does it all mean for Cyprus?
Ironically, it is Cyprus' youth who seem to have foreseen the long term effect of the bailout. Hundreds of high school students have taken to the streets to voice their dismay over what they see as a threat to their future, though they weren't blaming the government for everything. Placards bearing unflattering comments about the German Chancellor Angela Merkel peppered their morning marches, orchestrated to pass under the gaze of the cameras of hundreds of journalists who set up camp in one of Nicosia's main squares and at the parliament building.
The feeling of worry was palpable. The Russians might lose their money, the young protesters seemed to be saying, but what about us? We could have just lost our future.
I reached the end of the street and at the border crossing stumbled across a completely different, more Turkish side of Cyprus. I walked about 100 meters and spotted the bank. The bank's doors were open, its Turkish flag blowing in the wind. Here people are pleased with the weather. Summer is coming. It's the high season for tourists and hopefully this year will be fruitful. Spare a thought for your Greek counterparts? A shop assistant shrugged.
What the long term effect of this bailout will be is anybody's guess. The rules change every day and while the government insists that the bailout -- and all that comes with it -- is the lesser of two evils, the people sitting in the cafes, those trying to run a business, and the shoe shiner trying to eek out a living remain unconvinced.
The last two weeks have shattered Cypriots' confidence in their country, and the people are fully aware that like a rabbit in the jungle, Cyprus has been well and truly cornered.

How to end the elephant slaughter
By Cristian Samper, Patrick Bergin, Peter Seligmann, Azzedine Downes, and Carter Roberts
updated 10:48 AM EDT, Fri September 27, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Writers: Elephant poaching in Africa helps finance armed gangs and rebel armies
They say this destabilizes nations, wipes out elephant population for ivory trade
They say elephant range states, ivory consumer nations, NGOs have new plan to push back
Writers: Stopping ivory demand by changing cultural behavior will help end poaching
Editor's note: Cristián Samper is the president and CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society; Patrick Bergin is the president and CEO of the African Wildlife Foundation; Peter Seligmann is chairman and CEO of Conservation International; Azzedine Downes is the president and CEO of the International Fund for Animal Welfare; and Carter Roberts is the president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund
(CNN) -- Dzanga Bai is a magical place of natural wonder. It is on the Central African Republic's southwest border with the Republic of Congo and is widely considered the most important gathering place for forest elephants in the entire Congo basin. For decades -- and probably centuries -- elephants by the hundreds from across the region have congregated there, reconnecting with family members and drinking the mineral-rich waters.
Last May, a group of heavily armed men, believed to be linked to the Seleka rebel group, entered Dzanga Bai and slaughtered a reported two dozen elephants. By the time Dzanga Bai's elephant carcasses were discovered, the perpetrators were gone, leaving in their wake a horrific crime scene of heads carved up for their precious ivory. Tusks like these, typically destined for Asian markets, where growing demand has quickly driven up prices, have in recent years presented a new opportunity for quick cash to finance the operations of armed gangs from the Central African Republic east to Somalia. It is now widely understood that groups ranging from Darfur's Janjaweed to Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army have turned to this revenue source.
"The devastating poaching crisis that has gripped Africa over the past decade has left multiple tragedies in its wake..."
The growth of these groups, with funds from illegal wildlife trafficking, is destabilizing African governments even as it devastates populations of elephants, rhinos and other high value wildlife. Operating through terror and intimidation, roving rebel armies undermine democratic governance and responsible resource management while devastating regional economies through disruptions to tourism and local livelihoods.
In meetings in the United States, Asia and Africa this year, we have listened as leaders have shared their growing anxiety. The new poachers are tied to criminal syndicates. Rifles and machetes have been enhanced or replaced with helicopters, night visions goggles, sophisticated telecommunications and automatic weapons. Local communities are terrified and national governments fear losing large swaths of territory to these gangs.
Out of these conversations has emerged a challenge to the world—from African nations--to stop buying ivory. Representatives of the governments of Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Liberia, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, along with the international nongovernmental organizations we represent, have gathered in New York this week to announce an important commitment through the Clinton Global Initiative. Together, we have three straightforward goals: (1) stop the killing; (2) stop the trafficking; and (3) stop the demand.
To stop the killing and the trafficking, the international community can help states that make up the present range of the African elephant by providing equipment, training and expertise. President Obama recently dedicated $10 million for law enforcement efforts and the creation of a wildlife trafficking task force at the highest levels of the U.S. government, complementing existing U.S. initiatives. European and other nations, along with private citizens, need to join him in committing emergency resources to enforcement efforts in elephant landscapes and ivory trafficking ports.

Saving Kenya's elephants
Despite a ban on international trade in ivory imposed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1989, domestic sales remain legal in a number of countries, including the United States. Because these legal markets can provide a front for laundering illegal ivory into the trade, moratoria on domestic sales of ivory are also a vital part of anti-trafficking efforts.
Stopping the demand requires new strategies. Removing the prestige associated with buying ivory requires creative new uses of social media and other tools to change consumption behavior in China and elsewhere. Once the demand for ivory is curtailed there will be little financial incentive for criminal groups to continue elephant poaching and trafficking.
Yet because carved ivory is a centuries-old cultural tradition, this change will take time -- something the world's dwindling elephant populations don't have. That is why African nations with the greatest remaining elephant populations have begun to call for nations across the globe to stop selling and purchasing ivory until all African elephant populations have recovered to healthy levels.
The devastating poaching crisis that has gripped Africa over the past decade has left multiple tragedies in its wake: the loss of roughly three-quarters of all remaining African forest elephants; the murder of hundreds of courageous wildlife guards; regional government resources stretched to their limits as villagers across sub-Saharan Africa live in daily terror.
The initiative launched this week by representatives of elephant range states, ivory consumer nations, and our organizations has been endorsed by an unprecedented group of conservation partners that include the African Parks Network, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the Frankfurt Zoological Society, the Freeland Foundation, the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, National Geographic, Save the Elephants, TRAFFIC, WildAid, and Wildlife Direct.
This effort is our best bet at saving these majestic, highly intelligent and socially complex creatures while bringing much-needed stability to governments whose hopes for a brighter future require that armed gangs no longer operate within their borders. Before it's too late, let's stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand.

Vocal cord paralysis
Filed under: Brain & Nervous System
Vocal cord paralysis occurs when the nerve impulses to your voice box (larynx) are interrupted. This results in paralysis of the muscle of the vocal cords. Vocal cord paralysis can affect your ability to speak and even breathe. That's because your vocal cords, sometimes called vocal folds, do more than just produce sound. They also protect your airway by preventing food, drink and even your saliva from entering your windpipe (trachea) and causing you to choke. There are a number of causes of vocal cord paralysis including damage to nerves during surgery and certain cancers. Vocal cord paralysis can also be caused by a viral infection or a neurological disorder. Treatment for vocal cord paralysis usually includes voice therapy; however, surgery is also sometimes necessary. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Symptoms
Your vocal cords are two flexible bands of muscle tissue that sit at the entrance to the windpipe (trachea). When you speak, the bands come together and vibrate to make sound. The rest of the time, the vocal cords are relaxed in an open position, so you can breathe. In most cases of vocal cord paralysis, only one vocal cord is paralyzed. If both of your vocal cords are affected, you may have vocal difficulties, as well as significant problems with breathing and swallowing. Signs and symptoms of vocal cord paralysis may include: A breathy quality to the voice
Hoarseness
Noisy breathing
Loss of vocal pitch
Choking or coughing while swallowing food, drink or saliva
The need to take frequent breaths while speaking
Inability to speak loudly
Loss of your gag reflex
Ineffective coughing
Frequent throat clearing
When to see a doctor
If you have unexplained, persistent hoarseness for more than three or four weeks, or if you notice any unexplained voice changes or discomfort, contact your doctor. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Causes
In vocal cord paralysis, the nerve impulses to your voice box (larynx) are disrupted, resulting in paralysis of the muscle. Doctors often don't know the cause of vocal cord paralysis. Known causes may include: Injury to the vocal cord during surgery. Surgery on or near your neck or upper chest can result in damage to the nerves that serve your voice box. Surgeries that carry a risk of damage include surgeries to the thyroid or parathyroid glands, esophagus, neck, and chest.
Neck or chest injury. Trauma to your neck or chest may injure the nerves that serve your vocal cords or the voice box itself.
Stroke. A stroke interrupts blood flow in your brain and may damage the part of your brain that sends messages to the voice box.
Tumors. Tumors, both cancerous and noncancerous, can grow in or around the muscles, cartilages or nerves of your voice box and can cause vocal cord paralysis.
Inflammation. Arthritis or surgery can cause inflammation and scarring of the vocal cord joints or the space between the two vocal cord cartilages, and this inflammation may prevent your vocal cords from opening and closing. The symptoms and signs of this disorder mimic vocal cord paralysis, even though the vocal cord nerves remain normal. In addition, some viral infections can cause inflammation and damage directly to the nerves in the larynx.
Neurological conditions. If you have certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, you may experience vocal cord paralysis. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of developing vocal cord paralysis include: Being female. Women are slightly more likely to develop vocal cord paralysis.
Undergoing throat or chest surgery. People who need surgery on their thyroid, throat or upper chest have an increased risk of vocal cord nerve damage. Sometimes breathing tubes used in surgery or to help you breathe if you're having serious respiratory trouble can damage the vocal cord nerves.
Having a neurological condition. People with certain neurological conditions — such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or myasthenia gravis — are more likely to develop vocal cord weakness or paralysis.

Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Complications
Breathing problems associated with vocal cord paralysis may be so mild that you just have a hoarse-sounding voice, or they can be so serious that they're life-threatening. Because vocal cord paralysis keeps the opening to the airway from completely opening or closing, other complications may include choking on or actually inhaling (aspirating) food or liquid. Aspiration that leads to severe pneumonia is very serious and requires immediate medical care. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Preparing for your appointment
You're likely to first see your primary care doctor unless both vocal cords are paralyzed. In that case, you'll probably first be seen in a hospital emergency department. After the initial assessment, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in ear, nose and throat disorders. You may also be referred to a doctor who treats disorders of nerves (neurologist) and a speech-language pathologist for voice assessment and therapy. It's helpful to arrive well prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready and what to expect from your doctor. What you can do Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent illnesses or life changes.
Make a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements that you're taking, including the dose of each.
Ask a family member or friend to come with you, if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all of the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
Write down questions to ask your doctor.
Your time with your doctor may be limited, so preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time together. For vocal cord paralysis, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
What's the most likely cause of my vocal cord paralysis?
What kinds of tests do I need? Do these tests require any special preparation?
Is this condition temporary, or will my vocal cords always be paralyzed?
What treatments are available, and which do you recommend?
What types of side effects can I expect from treatment?
Are there any alternatives to the treatment that you're suggesting?
Are there any restrictions on using my voice after treatment? If so, for how long?
Will I be able to talk or sing after treatment?
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask any additional questions that occur to you during your appointment. What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as: When did you first begin experiencing symptoms?
Were there any special events or circumstances that happened before or at the same time that your symptoms developed?
Have you received any treatment yet?
Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
How are your symptoms affecting your lifestyle?
Does anything seem to improve your symptoms?
What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?
Do you have any other medical conditions?

Tests and diagnosis
Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and lifestyle, listen to your voice, and ask you how long you've had voice problems. To further evaluate your voice problems, the following tests may be performed:
Endoscopy. Your doctor will look at your vocal cords using a mirror or a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) or both. You may also have a test called videostrobolaryngoscopy that's done using a special scope that contains a tiny camera at its tip or a larger camera connected to the scope's viewing piece. These special endoscopes allow your doctor to view your vocal cords directly or on a video monitor to determine the movement and position of the vocal cords and whether one or both vocal cords are affected.
Laryngeal electromyography. This test measures the electric currents in your voice box muscles. To obtain these measurements, your doctor typically inserts small needles into your vocal cord muscles through the skin of the neck. This test is only rarely performed because it doesn't usually provide information that might change the course of treatment.
Blood tests and scans. Because a number of diseases may cause a nerve to be injured, you may need additional tests to identify the cause of the paralysis. Tests may include blood work, lung function tests, X-rays, MRI or CT scans.

Treatments and drugs
Treatment of vocal cord paralysis depends on the cause, the severity of symptoms and the time from the onset of symptoms. Treatment may include voice therapy, bulk injections, surgery or a combination of treatments. In some instances, you may get better without surgical treatment. For this reason, your doctor may delay permanent surgery for six months to a year from the beginning of your vocal cord paralysis. Bulk injections using collagen-like substances are often done within the first month of voice loss, however. During the waiting period for surgery, your doctor may suggest voice therapy to help keep you from using your voice improperly while the nerves heal.
Voice therapy
Voice therapy sessions involve exercises or other activities to strengthen your vocal cords, improve breath control during speech, prevent abnormal tensions in other muscles around the paralyzed vocal cord and protect your airway during swallowing. Occasionally, voice therapy may be the only treatment you need if your vocal cords were paralyzed in a location that doesn't require additional bulk or repositioning.
Surgery
If your vocal cord paralysis symptoms don't fully recover on their own, surgical treatments may be offered to improve your ability to speak and to swallow. Surgical options include:
Bulk injection. Paralysis of the nerve to your vocal cord will probably leave the vocal cord muscle thin and weak. To add bulk to a paralyzed vocal cord, a doctor who specializes in disorders of the larynx (laryngologist) may inject your vocal cord with a substance such as body fat, collagen or another approved filler substance. This added bulk brings the affected vocal cord closer to the middle of your voice box so that the opposite functioning and moving vocal cord can make closer contact with the paralyzed cord when you speak, swallow or cough.
Structural implants. Instead of using a bulk injection, this procedure — known as medialization laryngoplasty or laryngeal framework surgery — relies on the use of an implant in the larynx to reposition the vocal cord. Rarely people who have this surgery may need to have a second surgery to reposition the implant.
Vocal cord repositioning. In this procedure, a surgeon moves a window of your own tissue from the outside of your voice box inward, pushing the paralyzed vocal cord toward the middle of your voice box. This allows your unimpaired vocal cord to better vibrate against its paralyzed partner.
Replacing the damaged nerve (reinnervation). In this surgery, a healthy nerve is moved from a different area of the neck to replace the damaged vocal cord. It can take as long as six months before the new nerves start working. Some doctors combine this surgery with a bulk injection.
Tracheotomy. If both of your vocal cords are paralyzed and positioned closely together, your airflow will be decreased. In this situation, you'll have a lot of trouble breathing and require a surgical procedure called a tracheotomy. In a tracheotomy, an incision is made in the front of your neck and an opening created directly into the windpipe (trachea). A breathing tube is inserted, allowing air to bypass the immobilized vocal cords.
Emerging treatments
Linking the vocal cords to an alternative source of electrical stimulation — perhaps a nerve from another part of the body or a device similar to a cardiac pacemaker — may restore opening and closing of the vocal cords. Researchers continue to study this and other options.

Coping and support
Vocal cord paralysis can be frustrating and sometimes debilitating, especially because your voice affects your ability to communicate. A speech therapist can help you develop the skills you need to communicate. Even if you're not able to regain the voice you once had, speech therapy can help you learn effective ways to compensate. In addition, a speech-language pathologist can teach you efficient ways to use your voice without causing further damage to the vocal mechanism.

Tributes and Information
She was so young and so beautiful with the whole world ahead of her. And then gone in such a horrible way and for what? Irena Karshenbaum, Calgary, Canada
Dear Joanne, I know you are in Heaven right now, and I'm so sorry your life had to end this way. I myself am a survivor of those attacks. Everytime I see your picture I feel this connection even though we've never met. May God bless your soul always and please pray for us, as we will for you. I will see you one day at the gates of heaven. Lisa Garcia
Joanne, You don't know me but as a fellow Greek, I feel I lost someone very close to me. It is just a tragedy what happened to you and the rest of the victims of the 9/11 tragedy. Your smile in your picture will always remain forever in my mind, and I hope your smile ensures the terrorist behind this that they have NOT (succeeded) in breaking the spirit of the American people. May your memory be eternal and may your family find the peace one day very soon in dealing with your tragic lost. Na se echi kala o Theoulis. With much love, Basil Fottis
Although I never knew you and never will your picture has touched me deeply. In your eyes the pain of 9-11 comes to me as a haunting dream. The youth and beauty that was taken from the world by your light being extinguished has made all of mankind the worse. I know your family must be devastated, for I know one such as you surely was loved greatly. In another life you now reside for ever away from the evil of this world. Rest with ever lasting peace. Douglas
The light that shined in those beautiful eyes, was extinguished here but for a time. When on Heaven Seas we first arrive, we again see that light within those eyes. Charlie Dean
A symbol of Greek presence in America, an ambassador of the best of Greek virtues in the United States. In your footsteps others shall follow as you have not gone in vain. Demetris Vryonides
A beautiful light taken from the world. I do not know you, but I am sure that the smile I saw in the memorial brought joy to those who knew you. Jeffrey Turcotte
I will miss your kindess very much. You are one in a million.	Ejaz Bonaccorti, friend
I feel compelled to express how sorry I am about Joanne. I didn't know her personally but she is the cousin of a friend here in Toronto. I can only imagine the pain of her family and the families of all the other victims. I can offer you no comfort, just my humble prayers.
Kelly McMartin, family friend
God Bless you, beautiful girl! We will never forget you. Our hearts break every day.
Holly Carpenter
Joanne was an acquaintance back in the early 1990s at Stony Brook University. She was friendly and smart, and I'm sorry not to have heard better news.
David Solis, acquaintance
