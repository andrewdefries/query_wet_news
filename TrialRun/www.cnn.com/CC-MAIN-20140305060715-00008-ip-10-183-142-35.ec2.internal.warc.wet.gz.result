CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- On the day suicide bombers blew themselves up in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Dahab, I switched the TV in the Atlanta anchor office to Egyptian television. I wanted to see how local media were covering the news of the triple bombing that killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens more on April 24th.The news anchor was conducting a telephone interview with a Dahab tourism industry worker who'd run out of his hotel in panic after hearing one of the three explosions."I can't tell you what I saw. It was too awful. Do you really want to hear it?" he asked on live television."Yes, tell us what you saw. " the anchor insisted."Blood everywhere. Arms, legs..."And his voice cracked."I've been working in Dahab 14 years," he added in a controlled sob. The implication was clear: he'd worked 14 years in this resort town and this would be the day that would forever alter his life and, most likely, his livelihood and that of his family.Tourism is by far the biggest source of revenue for Dahab and other Red Sea resorts, like Sharm el-Sheikh and Taba. Those towns too, were recently hit by suicide attacks. Dozens were killed, hundreds wounded.Authorities blame homegrown Al Qaeda-inspired groups from Bedouin tribes.Whoever they are, many Middle Eastern countries are now facing internal Islamist violence. These are groups whose aim is to destabilize governments viewed as secular, corrupt and "in bed" with the West.In Saudi Arabia, for instance, the government is sparing no expense in building state of the art surveillance systems. It is also spending millions training elite squadrons of special forces to catch terrorists.In Jordan, there was a triple suicide bombing last November. I was sitting in one hotel lobby in Amman that day, when three other hotel lobbies blew up, killing dozens, including Syrian-American filmmaker Mustafa Akkad. Ironically - and tragically - Akkad was best known for directing a movie about the peaceful messages within Islam.After decades of regimes that have stifled true dissent, the most organized form of political opposition in many countries in the region is violent Islamic militancy.And some say it is the responsibility of religious leaders to stop the bloodshed. Islamic scholar and author Reza Aslan wrote after the Amman bombings last November that moderate Muslim clerics must reclaim a faith hijacked by extremists. He noted that Clerics must realize Muslims "are far more threatened by the rise of Islamic terrorism than is the West."But there are timid, fledging attempts at creating secular opposition groups to Middle East governments that are not known for tolerating dissent. And many of them live and try to prosper as much in the virtual as in the physical world, testing the limits of what authorities will tolerate.In this month's Inside the Middle East, Brent Sadler introduces us to Syrian reformist Ayman Abdel Nour. In a candid interview, he talks about his Web site in which he openly criticizes Syrian authorities, and the trouble he's faced - and is still facing - in doing so. Sadler also speaks to the new Syrian Telecommunication minister.Will the Syrian authorities truly open the web when doing so will create platforms for its own citizens speak out more freely? There is not shortage of skeptics on that matter.We'll also be featuring a story on "robot camel jockeys" in the Gulf. After years of criticism from human rights groups, countries like the UAE and Qatar have banned using small children as camel jockeys and are testing out interesting mechanized devices. Also, Becky Anderson will be visiting England's first Middle East cooking school.Hope you can join us for this month's show.Next month, we will feature an exclusive story on an important, controversial topic never before covered on television.Watch this space!

You can find easy money managementStory Highlights Web sites aimed at helping people understand personal finance are booming Sites offer everything from spending patterns at a glance to ways to save Users of all ages can sign up, and many of the sites are free With the economy stalling, people are paying more attention to their money Next Article in Living » By Lisa Respers France CNN	(CNN) -- When Angela D'Arcy and her husband, Daniel, decided that they wanted to pay off debt and set up a budget, they did what seems to come naturally to many people researching a topic they don't know much about. Web sites like Mint.com are attracting young adults trying to get a handle on their personal finances. They went online. If ever there was a time when budgeting, saving and keeping track of spending was important, now seems to be it, and Web sites that specialize in such services are attracting more users every day. People who are trying to get a grip on the new financial realities and who are used to living in a world of social networking and technology are gravitating toward them and chucking those old checkbook ledgers aside. D'Arcy, 27, and her 28-year-old husband signed up for Mint.com and SmartyPig.com to help set them on the path to fiscal freedom, which includes paying off a student loan and saving for a trip to Spain. The couple lives in Sacramento, California, and said the recession served as a strong wake-up call to get a better handle on their finances. Don't Miss Mint.com
SmartyPig.com
Thrive.com
"People are starting to pay more attention to what they are spending their money on, and this is a really easy way to set up all of your accounts so you can really see where all of your money is going," D'Arcy said. "It helps you to better manage it, and it makes it feel less overwhelming." Mint.com founder and Chief Executive Officer Aaron Patzer said that's just what he had in mind when he started his online money management site. The 27-year-old CEO said the average person has a great deal of financial information to keep track of, from savings to mortgages, student loans and credit cards. Patzer said that being able to see how much you are spending can really help users make their dollars stretch. "It's just illuminating to a lot of people to see on the pie chart that this is what I spent on travel, food or housing expenses," he said. "They can then see where they can cut back just by having an easy way to see their spending." Patzer said his free site -- which recently hit the million-user milestone -- brings together all of that data in an easy-to-use format that allows for a fuller personal finance picture. Mint.com also helps save users money by directing them to credit cards that offer lower interest rates, displays investment performance and allows users to compare their portfolio to market benchmarks to learn whether their investment growth is meeting their goals. Those extra dollars then need a home, and that's where sites like SmartyPig.com come in. Co-founders Jon Gaskell and Mike Ferrari know how hard it can be to save some dough. The idea germinated when Ferrari opened a college savings account a few years ago after the birth of his son and started considering ways to save for short-term goals. Users can open an account for free, set a savings goal and then stash that extra cash. The site lets the user know exactly how much he or she needs to save over the allotted time in order to reach his or her goal. With so much mounting debt among credit card holders, especially young Americans, both Gaskell and Ferrari said, there needs to be more of a focus on saving. "Two years ago, the average American spent $101 for every $100 they made," Gaskell said. "As of January of this year, they are spending about $95 of that $100 and putting away $5, so what we are seeing is pretty phenomenal in the uptick of customers." Such customers also crave guidance on what to do with their hard-earned dollars. Avi Karnani is co-founder of Thrive, a company whose mission is "to provide financial advice to anybody who needs it for free on the Web." Like some of the other sites, Thrive bundles all of the user's financial data to help formulate a budget. The site also helps its users analyze their financial information and calculates their financial health, aiding them in predicting their financial stability in the long term. Young people aren't always finically savvy, Karnani said, and they need sites like his to help educate them as well as lessen some of the stress that comes from dealing with money. "You might start out at 22, when you graduate college, with the attitude that 'Maybe I don't need to put a ton of attention onto this stuff,' but that's kind of a typical fallacy that many people are realizing is not that case," Karnani said. "That 22-year-old is eventually going to be 35, and they are going to want to get a house, get married and have a child or any of these big financial life events." The D'Arcys are focusing on a smaller life event. Since they have been so successful in chiseling way at their debt, they are now looking toward another goal. "We are using SmartyPig to save up for a trip to Spain for my husband's 30th birthday," Angela D'Arcy said. "We don't always like to get birthday presents or Christmas presents, and the cool thing is that with this site is, you can send the link to your family and friends and say, 'Don't buy me that weird sweater. You can donate some money to this big trip we are going on.' " D'Arcy will even be able to keep track of financial dealings while she is away. Mint.com has an iPhone application as well as a feature where users can text to receive real-time balances, and SmartyPig recently launched a mobile site. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Antarctic ice shelves 'tearing apart', says study
By Matthew Knight, CNN
updated 10:48 PM EDT, Wed March 28, 2012
The birth of an iceberg on Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica in October 2011. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New satellite survey of West Antarctica ice shelves has revealed fracturing away from land Nearly 40 years of satellite data give most comprehensive snapshot of ice shelf evolution
West Antarctic ice shelf melting adds 2mm to sea levels each year
(CNN) -- A new satellite study of ice shelves in West Antarctica has revealed they are steadily losing their grip with adjacent land and could intensify the acceleration of ice loss in the area.
The ice shelves (floating extensions of land-based ice sheets) in the eastern Amundsen Sea Embayment are fracturing at their margins on rocky bay walls, according to glaciologists from the University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics (UTIG).
Lead author of the study Joseph MacGregor said in a statement: "Typically, the leading edge of an ice shelf moves forward steadily over time, retreating episodically when an iceberg calves off (breaks off and floats out to sea), but that is not what happened along the shear margins."
"Anyone can examine this region in Google Earth and see a snapshot of the same satellite data we used, but only through examination of the whole satellite record is it possible to distinguish long-term change from cyclical calving," MacGregor added.
The study, which examined satellite data from 1972 to the end of 2011, is the most comprehensive yet of ice shelf evolution say the scientists, and reveal substantial changes which were "especially rapid" during the past decade.
An accelerating glacier can tear away from its margins, creating rifts that negate the margins' resistance to ice flow and causing additional accelerationGinny Catania, University of Texas at Austin
The shear margins which bind the ice shelves laterally are now heavily rifted they say, resembling cracks in a mirror when observed in satellite images.
"As a glacier goes afloat, becoming an ice shelf, its flow is resisted partly by the margins, which are the bay walls or the seams where two glaciers merge," Ginny Catania, assistant professor at UTIG said in a statement.
"An accelerating glacier can tear away from its margins, creating rifts that negate the margins' resistance to ice flow and causing additional acceleration," she added.
Interactive: Sea-level change map
The ice shelves in West Antarctica, which include the floating extensions of the Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers, are already losing volume say scientists.
As they get smaller they become less able to hold back grounded ice upstream, according to scientists whose study is published in the Journal of Glaciology.
Satellite imaging in what is a particularly inhospitable, heavily crevassed part of the continent is vital for ice shelf research, says Hamish Pritchard of the British Antarctic Survey.
"We've suspected for quite a long time that the glaciers are fairly sensitive to what happens with ice shelves. Big changes are happening along the coast," Pritchard said.
"There are certain large glaciers (like Thwaites and Pine Island) that have been accelerating for the past 20 years or so -- they are losing a lot of ice into the sea and they are thinning," he added.
West Antarctica is particularly interesting because of what could happen in the future, Pritchard says.
"The ice sheet is actually sitting on the sea floor -- 2,000-3,000 meters deep in some places," he said.
"That means if you thin the ice enough by draining the ice away from the edges, what could happen is the ice could just start to float off and the whole ice sheet could collapse, and quite quickly."
Melting in West Antarctica is contributing about 1-2 millimeters a year to sea levels but that could rise if the acceleration trend continues, Pritchard says.

McIlroy dismisses claim that Tiger is 'intimidated' updated 1:22 PM EDT, Thu September 20, 2012
Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods will fight it out at the PGA Tour Championship in Atlanta with both men desperate for victory.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
World No.1 Rory McIlroy plays down suggestion that Tiger Woods is intimidated by him
Comments made by Australia's Greg Norman have been made light of by both Woods and McIlroy
Woods aiming to beat McIlroy to $10 million prize for coming top in FedExCup overall standings Tour Championship in Atlanta which starts Thursday will decide winner of $10 million jackpot
(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has played down comments made by Australian golfing legend Greg Norman that his emergence as the world's most dominant golfer is intimidating Tiger Woods.
Norman's comments have led to Woods jokingly referring to the Northern Irishman as "The Intimidator," says McIlroy. But it's a nickname he neither deserves, nor takes seriously, he says.
"No. How can I intimidate Tiger Woods? I mean, the guy's got 75 or whatever PGA Tour wins, 14 majors. He's been the biggest thing ever in our sport," he added.
"How could some little 23-year-old from Northern Ireland with a few wins come up and intimidate him. It's just not possible. I don't know where he got that from, but it's not true," he added.
But Norman, a two-time major winner, believes a changing of the golfing guard is underway.
"When have you ever seen him intimidated by another player? Never. I think [Tiger] knows his time's up and that's normal; these things tend to go in 15-year cycles," Norman told Foxsports.com.
Woods and McIlroy have been paired together in the opening round of the Tour Championship -- the final playoff in this year's FedExCup -- which starts at East Lake Golf Club, Atlanta on Thursday.
McIlroy will guarantee himself $10 million if he wins the tournament and has a good chance of taking the prize with a top-five finish, according to PGATour.com.
PGATour.com FedExCup winning scenarios
Victory in the Tour Championship would also see McIlroy complete four wins from his five most recent tournaments on the PGA Tour -- a sequence which began at the U.S.PGA Championship.
"It would just cap off a great year," McIlroy said. "It's hard to compare [the playoffs] to a major championship because it's a year--long thing and it's about being consistent.
"You have to play well at the right time like I have the last couple of weeks. It would be nice to have something to recognise that you have played the best golf the whole way throughout the year."
"If I win [the Tour Championship], I win [the FedExCup]," he said.
"That's the mindset I'm coming in with. I feel like I'm playing well enough to win. I know if I do that, everything else takes care of itself."
Meanwhile, McIlroy has revealed he will reconsider his decision to compete for Team GB at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
McIlory, who was born in Northern Ireland, received funding from the Golfing Union of Ireland before turning professional in 2007.
His comments that he would rather represent Team GB were criticized in some quarters, but McIlroy says he will make a decision nearer the time.
"After everything that happened last week it definitely makes me reconsider my position and reconsider a lot of things," he added.
"I think it just really hit home with me how important it is for a lot of people and how important my success has been to them."
"Obviously, I've had a lot of support from all sides - from people that call themselves Irish, from Northern Irish, to the whole of the UK, to people over here in the States.
"It just hit home with me at how my success is welcomed by everyone. It would be terrible for me to nearly segregate myself from one of those group that supports me so much.
"It's four years away - I still have a bit of time to decide. But, I'm very, very appreciative and very grateful of the support that I get from everyone."

Feds asked to examine Florida school deaths mystery
By Rich Phillips, CNN
updated 7:20 PM EST, Wed December 12, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sen. Bill Nelson is calling for a federal probe into more graves found at a defunct reform school
There were 31 known graves and a 2009 investigation determined no wrongdoing
This year, researchers found evidence of 98 deaths and 50 graves The century-old school closed last year, allegedly for budget issues (CNN) -- A top Florida lawmaker is demanding that the federal government help "get to the bottom" of dozens of deaths at a now defunct boys' reform school.
"For the sake of those who died and the family members still living, we've got to find out what happened at the school," U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said in a letter dated Wednesday to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.
His demand follows a report this week by state forensic investigators who say they've discovered evidence that there are 19 more grave sites than previously thought at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle town of Marianna.
For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school. State authorities have previously said there were 31 burial sites at the school, and a 2009 state investigation found no allegations of wrongdoing in connection with those deaths.
Now, investigators say there's evidence that 98 boys died at the school, and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves found on school grounds.
The school closed last year, allegedly because of budget cuts.
Mystery surrounds school graves
"The reform school may yield some ugly reminders about our past, but we absolutely must get to the bottom of this," Nelson said in a news release Wednesday.
Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, is demanding federal investigators investigate possible crimes at the school.
Nelson is asking the Justice Department to provide support and assistance to a team of anthropologists and forensic scientists from the University of South Florida as they continue to search the school grounds.
The Justice Department has not yet responded to Nelson's request.
The USF team, equipped with ground-penetrating radar, is currently searching another part of the property where another cemetery may exist. So far, they haven't found anything.
"We found burials within the current marked cemetery, and then we found burials that extend beyond that," said Dr. Erin Kimmerle, one of the investigating anthropologists. "For the majority, there's no record of what happened to them. So, they may be buried here, they may have been shipped to their families. But we don't know."
She said she hopes a more thorough investigation, which would include the exhumation of bodies, would bring some closure to the families.
"When there's no knowledge and no information, then people will speculate and rumors will persist or questions remain," she said.
Anthropologists begin digging to unearth what they believe are the remains of dozens of children buried on the grounds of a former reform school in Marianna, Florida. According to state and school records, nearly 100 children died while at the Dozier School for Boys, which closed in 2011.
On August 6, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and his Cabinet voted to allow the University of South Florida forensics team to excavate and examine the bodies. In 2012, forensic scientists sifted through 100-year-old paperwork to determine who is buried in this makeshift cemetery on the grounds of a former Florida reform school for boys.
Dr. Erin Kimmerle is part of the scientific investigation team looking into who is buried at the grave site. She says it is a humanitarian effort to identify and remember those who died.
Robert Straley says he endured 10 months of abuse at the reform school. A 2008-09 state investigation into similar allegations found no wrongdoing.
Ovell Smith Krell says her brother Owen died in 1940 under mysterious circumstances at the reform school. When she and her family went to find out what happened, the school said he was already buried. If he is buried at the school, Krell said she would like to claim his body and bring him home to her family's burial plot.
Forensic anthropologists -- who once worked for the U.N. in the former Yugoslavia searching for mass graves -- used ground penetrating radar to find out how many remains were buried in a small makeshift cemetery built on the grounds of the former reform school for boys near Tallahassee, Florida.
Metal pipe crosses mark the graves.

Florida graves mystery
Glen Varnadoe's uncle, Thomas Varnadoe, died at the facility in 1935. He wants state authorities to carry out exhumations so he can bring his uncle's remains home to Lakeland, Florida.
"This is my uncle's body. We want the state of Florida to point us to his grave and give us access to his remains so we can have him reburied with his family," he told CNN.
Varnadoe said both his father and uncle were both sent to the facility at one time, and -- according to his mother -- his father saw his dead uncle being buried on the property in the middle of the night.
Varnadoe says he does not intend to sue the state of Florida for damages. He says he simply wants his uncle's body.
"My mission is to recover his remains and bury him next to his mother," he said.
Who exactly is buried on the school grounds is a mystery that dates back to 1900, when the boys' school opened.
The research team has gone back in time, going over old, antiquated state records and conducting interviews with survivors, when possible. The existing cemetery is marked only by 31 rusting tubular steel crosses.
The forensic investigators say poorly kept, contradictory records have only added to the mystery about the cemetery and the school. Reform school ledgers and notations label some of the boys as "runaways," but it is unclear whether these boys were ever found. The school was officially closed in 2011.
"These are children who came here and died, for one reason or another, and have just been lost in the woods," said Kimmerle. "It's about restoring dignity."
My mission is to recover his remains and bury him next to his mother.Glen Varnadoe
During its century-long history, 98 deaths have been documented at the school, but the whereabouts of 22 bodies cannot be determined by examining historical records, according to Kimmerle.
Her team's findings only add to the mystery, controversy and horror that has surrounded the former reform school for years.
Elderly men, who were once sent to the reform school as wayward youth, have come forward with horrific tales of beatings, abuse and stories of boys who simply disappeared.
In 2008, Florida's then-Gov. Charlie Crist ordered a state investigation into allegations by a group of men, known as "The White House Boys," who had came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators in the 1960s.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement issued a report that found 31 boys were buried in the cemetery, although each individual plot could not be identified. That report found that most of the boys had died either in a 1914 fire or from a flu pandemic four years later.
At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records.
FDLE closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct, and no charges were filed.
The new findings will undoubtedly lead to speculation that the newly discovered graves are evidence of a generations-long criminal coverup by administrators of the prison.
In a statement to CNN, FDLE said it is aware of the new report.
"In the absence of any additional evidence, we do not anticipate further criminal investigative action," said Keith Kameg, an FDLE communications coordinator.

Case of N.Y. cop accused of cannibalism plot goes to jury
By Kristina Sgueglia, CNN updated 10:14 PM EST, Thu March 7, 2013
Gilberto Valle, a New York City police officer, is accused of engaging in a plot to kidnap women and cannibalize them.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jurors get case of Gilberto Valle, charged with conspiracy to kidnap in cannibalism plot
The New York City officer's e-mails outlined real plans, government contends
Valle's e-mails were "dark improv theater," his defense attorney argues New York (CNN) -- The fate of a New York City police officer accused of engaging in a plot to kidnap women and cannibalize them now lies in the hands of the jury.
Jurors began deliberations to determine whether e-mail conversations Gilberto Valle had with alleged co-conspirators about plans to kidnap, torture, rape, cook and eat women were real or fantasy role-play.
Valle, who was suspended without pay after his arrest in October, is charged in U.S. District Court with conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a law enforcement database illegally. None of Valle's alleged targets was ever victimized. Valle faces life in prison if convicted of conspiracy.
Cop's e-mails: Cannibalistic fantasies
Cop's cannibal fantasies a crime?
Probe: Ex-cop planned cannibalistic crime
Trial: Graphic photos, how-to-kidnap searches found on computer used by cop
In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman argued that the evidence shown in court proved that Valle had entered into an agreement with his co-conspirators to kidnap the alleged targets through e-mail conversations. Waxman argued that Valle conducted surveillance and handed out police charity cards in furtherance of his plan to kidnap the targets.
Waxman argued that Valle expressed "real, practical concern" for getting caught during his conversations and was methodical and strategic in his online research of how to carry out kidnappings. She said Valle's research of mass murderers and kidnappers were proof that he was trying to be careful about his alleged plan.
Waxman urged the jury to use "common sense" and look at the "big picture" during deliberation.
Cop's defense: Cannibalism chats were fantasy Defense attorney Julia Gatto began her closing statements by repeating "I have a world in my mind," Valle's words to another fantasy role-play partner extracted from e-mail conversations revealed in court. "In that world I'm kidnapping women and selling them to people interested in buying them," she read aloud from Valle's e-mail conversation.
She said Valle had engaged in "dark improv theater" and said he fantasized about real people to heighten the experience. Gatto told the jury that it was a part of "crude, stupid, infantile, masturbatory storytelling."
Gatto said the government's case was "riddled with reasonable doubt." She noted that testimony in court revealed the FBI did not find the chloroform, rope, or a human-size oven that Valle alleged he had.
"This case is about storytelling, and the government has told a story too," Gatto said in court.
Graphic e-mails read at New York cannibalism plot trial
Assistant U.S Attorney Randall Jackson said in his rebuttal that evidence proved that "this was not someone just having fun." He banged his fist on the table, telling the jury that government evidence revealed "things you would expect to see in a plot to actively victimize someone."
"His porn consists of dead bodies," Jackson said. "That is not normal."
In his instructions, Judge Paul Gardephe advised jurors not to convict based solely on the defendant's thoughts alone, or the nature of the content on the Dark Fetish Network reviewed in court.
The jury will resume its deliberations Friday morning.

Billy Graham's other voice
By Bob Greene, CNN Contributor
updated 11:05 AM EDT, Tue April 23, 2013
George Beverly Shea sings "How Great Thou Art" to 54,000 people at a Billy Graham crusade in 2003.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
George Beverly Shea, gospel singer at Billy Graham crusades, died recently at 104
Bob Greene: Regardless of their faith, people knew greatness when they heard Shea Graham was electric on stage, Greene says. Shea was soothing and comforting
Greene: With clear enunciation, dignified presence, he showed respect for his audience
Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story"; "Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War"; and "Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen." (CNN) -- Devoted fans.
Faithful listeners.
Seldom have those words sounded quite so apt.
They describe the people who enjoyed the singing of George Beverly Shea, who died last week at the age of 104. The name may not be instantly recognizable to some Americans, but that was no fault of his. He accomplished something very few vocalists can claim: During his career, he sang in front of an estimated 200 million people in live performance.
How could this be?
He was the lead vocalist at Billy Graham's crusades and revival meetings for more than 50 years. If you went to see Billy Graham preach, you heard George Beverly Shea sing.
Bob Greene
And, oh, what a voice he had.
It didn't matter what your own religious beliefs were. If you were interested in the craft -- the art -- of vocal performance, and you were in the presence of Bev Shea (that's how he was known to his friends), then you recognized greatness.

He was not fancy as he sang, he indulged in no gimmicks, at times he seemed as calm before a microphone as a man waiting patiently for a bus. But that was deceptive. His deep and immaculately modulated baritone, his resolute attention to precise phrasing and pronunciation, his implicit and unmistakable regard for his audience -- this was a professional artist of the highest order.
The fact that he sang gospel music might, in theory, have worked against him, might have limited the number of his potential listeners; for many of the years of his career, the nation was obsessed with rock 'n' roll and other forms of popular, here-one-week, gone-the-next records. But he had a certain advantage:
A singer's audience is often influenced by the person who presents him or her. In the Beatles' early days, they had CBS television's Ed Sullivan to do that. It made a big difference.
George Beverly Shea, for half a century, had Billy Graham to present him. At all those crusades, in all those stadiums and arenas, they were a matched pair. Graham wouldn't have had it any other way.
He was a major and incandescent star to them -- they had been listening to him for years.Bob Greene
They perfectly complemented each other's strengths. Graham, at his peak, was utterly electric on a stage -- his presence was crackling and palpable, there was no structure in the world too big for him. In the charisma and magnetism department, he needed no help.
But Shea was steady and soothing and reassuring. He was placid waters to Graham's blazing lightning. And for all those years, he was a considerable part of the draw.
Hear and see Bev Shea sing at 1961 Billy Graham crusade
In 1971, when I was getting started as a reporter, the Billy Graham Crusade was scheduled to come to Chicago's cavernous McCormick Place for a week-and-a-half of summer services. I asked his advance team if I could spend days and nights with them, observing how they did what they did: how they made the arrangements and logistical decisions to get all those people to pack the huge hall every evening. They were welcoming and open about having me hang around.
Those were the years when the most successful and highly publicized musical acts were groups such as Three Dog Night and Creedence Clearwater and Alice Cooper.
He never tried to be stylish or trendy; he didn't shift his approach as the decades went by. He just sang like a dream.Bob Greene
So I was struck to find how constant, in my conversations with the people who were coming to the crusade meetings, their unprompted references to Shea were. He was a major and incandescent star to them -- they had been listening to him for years, and they couldn't wait to see him perform in person.
There was a phrase back then that was used in politics: the Silent Majority. In those times of turmoil and earsplitting acrimony in public life, the term referred to those Americans who didn't raise much commotion, but whose fidelity to tradition was unwavering.
I thought then, and I think now, that the concept also applied to the enduring popularity of Shea. He never tried to be stylish or trendy; he didn't shift his approach as the decades went by. He just sang like a dream -- and, with his clear, careful enunciation and his dignified comportment on stage, he showed unwavering respect for the people in the seats.
To watch and listen to Shea sing "How Great Thou Art," the gospel number most closely associated with him, was to be in the presence of an absolute master. (And if you've ever heard Elvis Presley's haunting rendition of the same song, then you just know that Elvis had to be a George Beverly Shea fan, too.)
He did fine for himself: more than 70 albums, a Grammy Award, a separate Lifetime Achievement Award from the Grammy organization. In the days when what is now called terrestrial radio -- that is, free radio, broadcast by local stations -- ruled, you couldn't help hearing his voice as you twisted the dial through the stations in your town. He was a permanent cast member of Billy Graham's "Hour of Decision," which was syndicated to local stations all over the country, and the power of that voice would stop your hand, at least momentarily, from seeking something farther down the dial.
On Sunday his funeral will be held in Montreat, North Carolina, his home for many years; on Monday he will be buried in a private ceremony on the grounds of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina.
I remember asking a member of the audience at that long-ago crusade in Chicago what it was that made Shea's music so important to her.
"When he sings," she said, "he just brings me comfort."
Which, in an often frenzied world, is not a bad sum-up of a long, serene and melodic life.

Teen featured in viral video dies
By Amanda Enayati, CNN Contributor
updated 3:21 PM EDT, Mon May 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Zach Sobiech was diagnosed at 14 with osteosarcoma, a bone cancer
Last May, Zach was given a year to live after doctors ran out of treatment options
Zach's song "Clouds" went viral on YouTube; now celebs have posted a response
(CNN) -- Zach Sobiech, 18, passed away Monday morning, surrounded by family and friends.
In the past few weeks, donations to Zach's cause -- the Children's Cancer Research Fund -- skyrocketed, as did downloads of his song, "Clouds," which at the time of his death had more than 2.9 million page views on YouTube.
Listen to "Clouds"
"We'd like to thank those people who listened with their hearts and helped Zach bring his message and his music to the world," the Sobiech family said in a statement.
When he was 14, Zach was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer that mostly strikes children. His prognosis wasn't great. Last May, with no more treatment options, he was given a year to live.
Zach began writing music after his cancer was diagnosed. His mom, Laura, was cleaning the family room downstairs last year when she found a folded-up piece of paper. She unfolded it to make sure it wasn't a homework assignment.
"I read through it and then I realized what I was reading," she said.
It was his first song, "Clouds." Zach wrote it for himself and his family. He wrote many more in the following years.
Watch celebrities sing along to "Clouds"
"I fell down, down, down into this dark and lonely hole," he sings at the beginning of the song, his voice beautiful, mellow -- kind of reminiscent of Jack Johnson's.
When Zach's song was posted to YouTube last year it quickly went viral. Recently dozens of celebrities posted a response -- joining forces to lip sync to Zach's voice singing "Clouds."
"And we'll go up, up, up, but I'll climb a little higher," sang Jason Mraz, Anna Faris and Rainn Wilson.
"Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer up here, my dear," sang Bryan Cranston and Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Colbie Caillat.
"It won't be long now," sang the Lumineers.
"If only," sang Sarah Silverman, "I had a little bit more time."
It was a hello to Zach, and a farewell. It was a collective expression of love and gratitude.
The motley crew of celebrities on the video was assembled by Wilson, an actor, and director/actor Justin Baldoni, who directed a short documentary about Zach for his compelling online reality series, "My Last Days," which runs on Wilson's SoulPancake YouTube channel.
Get to know Zach
"Going out to see Zach in Minnesota was one of the greatest experiences of my life," said Baldoni. "To make the choice to be happy despite whatever sad or tragic circumstances you may be living through ... he is this old soul who inspires everyone he meets. You leave and you think: 'I want to be a better person.'"
Watch Baldoni's film and you can see why.
Zach, top, poses for a photo with his family. There's Zach, a fresh-faced Minnesotan teenager, in one of the opening frames, saying: "I want everyone to know: You don't have to find out you're dying to start living."
He tells us at the beginning of the film: "You know most people live kind of in the middle, in between 'all your dreams come true' and 'you're dying,' and it's a very comfortable place to live. I'm living on the two extreme ends, so you have really, really good days and you have really, really bad days."
He lived on those extreme ends for the better part of the past four years. And how gloriously.
In his final days, Zach slept a lot. Once in awhile he was able to muster up enough energy to bring out his guitar and play.
"It's those times when we remember how it used to be," said his mom.
She told me about a trip the family took last year, "a sort of pilgrimage to Europe," with 10 intense days of sightseeing.
"We packed a lot into those 10 days," she recalled, "and maybe these past 3½ years have been like that pilgrimage. I haven't had the chance to let it sink in. I don't let myself go to that place of grief. There will be plenty of time to think about what we have lost later."
And maybe, she said, that is the lesson here: that no matter where you are in life, look at what you have and be grateful.
It's the kind of thing you hear all the time, but putting it into action takes some work.
"That's what Zach's always been really good at: recognizing what is good and being grateful for it," Laura said. "He taught all of us how it's done."
Taylor Engel, one of the YouTube commenters on Zach's video, writes: "Well, you got a 6', 220 pound man sobbing his face off here. Prayers and thoughts with you, Zach...I hope someday I can be half the man you've become."
So many of us felt the same way as we watched his video for "Clouds" -- grateful for having had him walk among us, albeit for a short time, as he sang: "And maybe someday I'll see you again. We'll float up in the clouds and we'll never see the end ..."

Brilliant Bartoli romps to Wimbledon title
updated 8:41 AM EDT, Sun July 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Marion Bartoli wins first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon beating Sabine Lisicki in straight sets The 28-year-old becomes only the second Frenchwoman to win Wimbledon in the open era
London (CNN) -- France's Marion Bartoli has claimed the women's singles title at Wimbledon with a crushing 6-1 6-4 victory over Sabine Lisicki.
The 28-year-old, a losing finalist against Venus Williams in 2007, swept aside her German opponent in one hour 21 minutes to claim her first Grand Slam title.
Bartoli becomes only the second French woman to win Wimbledon in the open era, following in the footsteps of Amelie Mauresmo who won in 2006.
"I'm so happy I am holding the trophy. It has been my dream since I was six years old. I would like to thank everyone in the crowd who supported me today," Bartoli said.

For Lisicki, the vanquisher of Serena Williams in the fourth round and Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis, the disappointment was almost too much to bear.
"Marion has been in that situation before and she handed it perfectly. She deserves it. I hope I get the chance one more time as well." Lisicki said fighting back tears.
Both women started the match nervously losing their opening service games, but it was Bartoli whose game suddenly gelled while Lisicki, appearing in her first Grand Slam title, wilted under the pressure on a sweltering Center Court.
With her game in top gear, Bartoli took the first set in just 29 minutes. A more composed Lisicki returned from a bathroom break and held her opening service game of the second set, before Bartoli reeled off five games in succession.

Lisicki, who stunned Serena Williams in the fourth round, fought to the end holding serve in the seventh game and breaking Bartoli as she served for the match in the next.
Another hold from the German made the score 5-4, but at the second time of asking Bartoli made no mistake, serving out the match to love and finishing with an ace.

'Downton Abbey' premiere breaks ratings record
By Brian Stelter, CNN
updated 9:05 AM EST, Tue January 7, 2014
"Downton Abbey," the Emmy award-winning upstairs-downstairs drama, returns to American TV on Sunday, January 5, for its fourth season. The Crawley family has seen two additions to the family in the wake of some (spoiler alert) shocking deaths. Expect all sorts of new drama from the family now that they're heading into the Roaring '20s, and look out for some new faces walking the halls. Let's see where we left off.
From left, Penelope Wilton as Isobel Crawley; Maggie Smith as Violet, Dowager Countess; Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley; Hugh Bonneville as Lord Grantham; Allen Leech as Tom Branson; Ruairi Conaghan as Kieran Branson; Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Crawley; Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, Countess of Grantham; and Laura Carmichael as Lady Edith Crawley.
Newly widowed Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) must deal with life as a single mom since Matthew's death, but how will she cope? It may not be long before our icy heroine is on the hunt for a new suitor.
Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) will surely be reeling from the unexpected passing of her son, but will Matthew's mother play a large part in raising her grandson, or will this be the last we see of her?
Molesley (Kevin Doyle) is without an employer after Matthew's death last season. But we think we'll still be seeing the former butler. (Also pictured, Siobhan Finneran as O'Brien.)
Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) has become a working woman, writing for a major newspaper. Will the other Crawley sister give in to her feelings for her older publisher? Tom Branson (Allen Leech) has been spending the last year and a half as a widowed father since the death of Lady Sybil. Branson must now fend off the advances of new staffers at Downton.
Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville, left) is faced with the challenges of getting his widowed daughter back on her feet, as well as getting the estate in a financially sound place. (Jim Carter as Mr. Carson pictured, right.)
The Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) continues her reign as the "Queen of Sass" at Downton, taking down everyone and everything in her path. Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) must help the downstairs staff adjust to the changes being implemented around Downton, including a major change for O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran).
(Pictured, Joanne Froggatt as Anna, Rob James-Collier as Thomas, Phyllis Logan as Mrs Hughes, Jim Carter as Carson, Siobhan Finneran as Sarah O'Brien, Kevin Doyle as Molesley.)
With Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle) out of prison, Lord Grantham's valet can begin his life in wedded bliss to Anna.
Anna (Joanne Froggatt) has worked to get Bates out of prison, and now she can finally enjoy having her husband back at Downton. (Also pictured, Matt Milne as Alfred, left and Rob James-Collier as Thomas).
With Daisy (Sophie McShera) gaining more responsibility in the kitchen, she will have to keep her personal feelings for footman Alfred at bay.
Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) must put aside her duties as Lady Grantham and help her eldest daughter in her time of need. Shirley MacLaine returns as Cora's mother, Martha Levinson, to bring some much needed Yank zest to Downton. Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) has more on her hands in the kitchen, continuing to deal with the drama of her young mentees Daisy and Ivy. Will the head cook get some well-deserved time for herself? Diversity at Downton! Gary Carr joins the series this season as Jack Ross, a jazz singer who is described as both charming and charismatic. Cousin Rose (Lily James) is back, and expect the rebellious teen to stay within trouble's reach. (Also pictured, Edward Baker-Duly as Margadale)

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
At least 10.2 million viewers tune in Sunday to season 4 premiere
That's up from 7.9 million at the start of "Downton's" season three
PBS executive says the show has become a post-holiday tradition
(CNN) -- The "Downton Abbey" phenomenon just keeps getting bigger.
Sunday's season four premiere of the upstairs-downstairs drama on PBS surpassed the comparable ratings for every previous episode. According to Nielsen data, at least 10.2 million viewers tuned in live (or within a few hours via digital video recorders) on Sunday night, up from 7.9 million at the start of season three and 8.2 million at the end of it.
This was more than a "personal best" for "Downton." The season four premiere outperformed every other drama on Sunday night, too. CBS's "The Good Wife," for instance, had 9.2 million viewers; ABC's "Revenge" had 6.7 million. (All these totals will increase once several days of digital video recorder viewership is factored in.)
PBS isn't rated like a traditional network because it doesn't carry traditional commercials.
Sneak peek of 'Downton Abbey' season 4
But even last season's "Downton" premiere was described as one of the highest-rated events in the history of the public broadcasting network; analysts said PBS hadn't seen numbers this high since the premiere of the "Civil War" documentary series in 1990. An apples-to-apples comparison is impossible because of changes in ratings methodology. But the season four premiere affirms that "Downton" is making history for the network.
Season four, of course, debuted several months ago in the United Kingdom. PBS has received no small amount of criticism for its decision to delay the episodes in the United States, and the network's executives are aware that some fans get a sneak peek by finding the episodes illegally on the Internet. But they say the sky-high ratings two seasons in a row are proof that their scheduling strategy is a wise one.
Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, said in a statement on Monday, "I'm so pleased that millions of viewers have returned to 'Downton Abbey' on their local PBS stations for what has become a post-holiday tradition."
Rebecca Eaton, the executive producer of "Masterpiece," added, "Julian Fellowes has written every word of all four seasons of 'Downton,' and I toss him a huge bouquet on behalf of his American fans."
The premiere ratings suggest "Downton" could grow to be even more popular as the season progresses. Last year 8.2 million viewers tuned in on the night of the season three finale, and more than 4 million tuned in later, for a total of 12.3 million. The second-to-last episode of the season did even better once delayed viewership was totaled up: 12.4 million. That's the next "personal best" for the drama to beat.
