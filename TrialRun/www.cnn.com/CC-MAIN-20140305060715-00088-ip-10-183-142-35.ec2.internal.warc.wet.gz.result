New York (CNN) -- There are some experiences that are too painful to bear. For New York Fire Chief Stephen King that event is 9/11.So painful were the memories of September 11, 2001, King retired from the fire department, and avoided bridges and tunnels. At one point, the native New Yorker stopped coming to Manhattan altogether."I was in the north tower, the one that got hit first. Where I was and what I saw that day -- the many people that jumped, the magnitude of it -- was just overwhelming," he told CNN.But thanks largely to a new tool in trauma treatment -- virtual reality -- King has returned to face the past."When I see the plane hit, the smoke come out, it brings me back there," he said.Using video game technology, therapists create programs that mimic the traumatic event. Dr. JoAnn Difede, an associate professor for the department of psychiatry and the director of Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Studies Program at Weill Cornell Medical College, is working with World Trade Center survivors to help them overcome the trauma. "The idea behind the treatment is to systematically expose the patient to aspects of their experience in a graded fashion so they can confront their fear of the trauma," she told CNN.The program is basic compared to slick video games on the market, but the developers say the simplicity allows patients to fill in the blanks. The treatment gives patients the ability to reconnect with their memories of that day, an important step for the healing process, Difede said. It can take weeks for a patient to advance just one stage, but Difede said she had been pleasantly surprised by the results. "Our patients have done very well. They tend to get better more quickly and it seems to engage them emotionally that allows more of their memories to be recalled," she said.The 3D imaging software has been created by Atlanta-based company Virtually Better. Initial studies have been so convincing that the U.S. Army has asked Virtually Better to create a program to help soldiers returning from Iraq.The company is also developing programs to help manage pain and treat addictions.Difede said that while results had been promising, the treatment was not a magic elixir and there was still a lot to learn about the virtual reality therapies.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Supreme Court to hear case about 'sex slave' Web siteStory Highlights Glenn Marcus was convicted of abusing woman who agreed to pose as "sex slave" Marcus posted pictures of the woman on his for-profit Web site Appeals court overturned his sentence on procedural grounds At issue, whether Marcus took relationship too far and held woman against her will Next Article in Crime » By Bill Mears CNN Supreme Court Producer	Editor's note: Details of the case may be disturbing to some readers. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will delve into the shadowy world of sadomasochism next year as it looks into the case of a sex trafficker, known as the "S&M Svengali," whose criminal conviction had been set aside. The Supreme Court will hear a case next year involving a sadomasochism Web site. The justices Tuesday agreed to accept the government's appeal of a case involving Glenn Marcus, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison for the sexual abuse, physical mutilation and psychological humiliation of a woman who had agreed to be photographed as his "sex slave." A federal appeals court threw out the conviction, saying some of the offenses occurred before the 2000 Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which was used to prosecute Marcus. Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- who was on that appeals court -- did not take part in the high court's consideration of whether to accept the appeal, and is not likely to attend oral arguments, which would take place early next year. Like her colleagues on the appeals bench, Sotomayor said at the time of the ruling that prior precedents required the conviction be set aside, but she conceded the Supreme Court might view the issue differently. She noted the justices had, in some cases, found that lower court errors in application of the law "do not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings." According to the trial record, Marcus ran a Web site that featured photos he had taken of women who acted as "sex slaves" and were subjected to varying levels of physical abuse. The woman at the center of the case -- identified only as "Jodi" -- had met the defendant in 1998 and agreed to participate in his commercial activities.

At issue was whether Marcus took the relationship too far and held Jodi against her wishes. Prosecutors claim he manipulated and forced the woman to undergo the punishment, then write about it for the Web site. The incidents took place at various locations between 1999 and 2001. Attorneys for Marcus said the relationship was consensual, even enjoyable, and that Jodi had signed an employment contract and was provided for through the for-profit Web site, which had paying members and advertising. They also said that while the public may find the details unsettling, it was done in the privacy of homes. The woman testified she felt like a prisoner and she could not escape her situation. Her head was shaved and the word "slave" was written on her stomach by Marcus with a knife. She claimed she was whipped regularly, hung by her arms from posts, and subjected to a range of humiliating poses. The appellate court concluded that Jodi never benefited financially, since Marcus had kept profits from the Web site. Other women along the East Coast also were involved in Marcus' master-slave business. The case is U.S. v. Marcus (08-1341).

5 things not to wear to the gym By Corrie Pikul, Oprah.com
updated 1:58 PM EST, Wed February 1, 2012
All-cotton t-shirts absorb sweat and don't quickly release it through evaporation, which can give you the chills and cause irritation.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
To avoid flashing everyone at the gym, check your top view from a variety of different angles before leaving home
Nanosilver is said to fight bacteria, but has unknown environmental effects
Wear capris, slim-fitting long pants or shorts instead of long, baggy sweatpants
(Oprah.com) -- All-Cotton T-Shirts
Let's disregard the fashion statement you're making by wearing an old, stretched-out shirt. The most important reason to leave this beloved tee at home is that cotton absorbs sweat and doesn't quickly release it through evaporation. Wearing heavy, wet cotton against your skin can give you the chills and cause irritation. Opt for technologically advanced fabrics that hold moisture away from the body, like CoolMax, Capilene or Dri-FIT. If you aren't comfortable in the clingy fit of these stretchy fabrics, this Reebok double-layer top offers two shirts in one. A supportive tank made of Play Dry wicking fabric is covered by a looser cotton tee with flattering ruching on the sleeves.
Untested Tanks
Your tank top may look modest when you're standing up, but it becomes X-rated as soon as you bend over to do push-ups. To avoid flashing everyone at the gym, check your top view from a variety of different angles before leaving home. Bend forward, reach and lean sideways and do jumping jacks to assess the bounce factor. Even non-impact activities require support, says Taj Harris, a certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor at Crunch gyms in New York City. "I had a woman in one of my spin classes who was rather busty," she says. "Her sports bra didn't fit, and riding the bike was causing her breasts to spill out all over the place. It was very distracting to everyone in the class -- including me!" This cleavage-proof Sakti tank from Athleta has a higher neckline that stylishly limits indecent exposure. For those who require extra support, Bounce offers an option for DDD athletes.

Silver Threads
Nanosilver is said to fight bacteria, molds and fungi, so a few years ago, companies began incorporating nanosilver particles into fitness apparel. It seemed like a flashy way to keep sweaty gym clothes from smelling stale. But the antimicrobial benefits may not last long. Researchers at Arizona State University found that after about four or five washings, nanosilver-treated fabric lost about half its particles, which then washed out into the water. Although the long-term effects of these ingestible particles on wildlife is still unknown, environmental groups have started sounding the alarm on nanosilver's ability to neutralize positive bacteria in some ecosystems. Until conclusive studies are released, save the money you would have spent on anti-odor clothing and put it toward laundry detergent instead.

Baggy Sweatpants
Long, baggy pants can catch on exercise machines like stationary bikes, where the hem can get stuck on the pedals or the water bottle holder. Harris has had to help untangle pants from bikes in some of her spin classes at Crunch. Long pants are also out of place in another class Harris teaches: pole dancing... and not for the reason you're thinking. Harris says that pants-clad legs slide right off the pole because they don't provide the same kind of grip that bare flesh does. Your best options for most classes are capris, slim-fitting long pants or shorts.

Thong Underwear
It's true that inconspicuous underwear looks better under slim-fitting shorts or pants. But thongs are not the best solution. When you sweat and move around during exercise, rectal bacteria can travel along the thong to the vagina, which can lead to infections both in the vagina and the urinary tract. This type of underwear can also exacerbate an existing irritation. Instead, pull on seamless, nearly invisible underwear bottoms in sweat-wicking material.

Not man enough? Buy a gun
By Paul Waldman, Special to CNN
updated 7:52 AM EST, Fri December 21, 2012
Semi-automatic rifles like this one are being marketed as a pathway to manliness.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle was used in last week's school massacre
Bushmaster markets those rifles as being a way to prove one's manhood, says Paul Waldman
Too many men seek to find their identity in instruments of destruction, Waldman says
Gun ownership is declining, yet gun sales are at record highs -- suggesting stockpiling, he says
Editor's note: Paul Waldman is a contributing editor at The American Prospect and the author of "Being Right Is Not Enough: What Progressives Must Learn From Conservative Success." Follow him on his blog and on Twitter.
(CNN) -- Marketers have long told potential customers that if you used their product, it would do more than satisfy your consumer desires, it would make you into the kind of person you want to be.
You may not be young, hip, and creative, but if you buy a computer from Apple, you can tell yourself that you are. Wearing a T-shirt from Under Armour won't actually turn you into an athlete, but it doesn't hurt to pretend.
And if you're anxious about your masculinity, if you aren't quite sure whether those around you find you sufficiently strong and potent, the Bushmaster corporation has an answer for you. If you buy one of their semi-automatic rifles -- like the kind Adam Lanza used to murder 20 children and six adults last week -- you may "Consider your Man Card reissued."
That's the message of ads the company has been running, along with a particularly ridiculous social media campaign. Until today -- the page has apparently been taken down, but parts of it are visible here -- you could learn on the "Man Card" section of Bushmaster's website that "In a world of rapidly depleting testosterone, the Bushmaster Man Card declares and confirms that you are a man's man." Then you could fill out a little form to bust on your buddies for not being manly enough, to "Revoke a Man Card." Just enter a brief description of the offense and put it into one of five categories: "Cry baby," "Cupcake," "Short leash," "Coward," or "Just unmanly."
Masculinity, mental illness and guns: A lethal equation?
Paul Waldman
The symbol for the last is the female restroom icon (a stick figure wearing a dress), but "Short leash" gets some of the best action, like "Steve A. missed a much-anticipated poker night to attend a movie musical instead," or "Heath K, where 'Yes I will' always becomes 'If she'll let me.' " All it takes to get that Man Card back is to get yourself a Bushmaster.
You don't have to be a Freudian analyst to grasp the hidden meaning. It's not even subtext -- it's text. As we begin a long-overdue examination of where gun culture in America has gone, we can't avoid the way guns have become so entwined with masculine anxiety, as so many men seek to find their identity in instruments of destruction.

This isn't particularly new, of course. Male anxiety has produced backlashes before, enacted through our fantasies as the world changes and tradition gender roles are challenged. A 1959 cover story in Time magazine described how at that time there were no fewer than 30 westerns on the three networks in prime time. For the post-war American male, an office job and a house in the suburbs offered few opportunities to prove one's manhood, so tales of two-fisted cowboys wielding six-guns became irresistible. "How long since you used your fists?" Time quoted one sociologist saying by way of explanation of the western's popularity. "How long since you called the boss an s.o.b? The western men do, and they are happy men."
Opinion: Teachers with guns is a crazy idea
Hernandez: More guns not the answer
Mass shooting survivors talk gun control
Making children bulletproof
With manual labor but a memory for most Americans, we have even fewer opportunities to enact rituals of manhood in the way our ancestors did. The strongest caveman may have led the tribe, but who are the masters of today's universe? A bunch of skinny, pasty kids who spend their days staring at computer screens. Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg may not be able to best you at arm-wrestling, but they could buy and sell you a thousand times over.
We have to find reassurance where we can, so even if we can't prove our masculinity on the job and our kids won't listen to us, there is a way to feel that testosterone surge through our bodies. Whatever else you think about guns, no one who has ever held one can deny that they make you feel potent and strong. You don't even need to fire it to appreciate its power -- just holding it is enough. So if watching your fantasies play out on TV doesn't quite scratch that itch, you can enact them yourself down at the range -- or get a concealed carry permit, and convince yourself that the only reason you're not Jack Bauer is that the right opportunity hasn't yet presented itself.
Here's something you may not realize: Gun ownership has been declining for decades. According to the University of Chicago's General Social Survey, in 1977, 54% of American households had guns. By 2010, the number had fallen to 32%. Yet gun sales are at record highs. That means that existing gun owners are buying more and more guns. It's not enough to have a hunting rifle over your mantle; you need an entire arsenal, just in case the government falls, society disintegrates, and you have to protect your cave -- sorry, your home -- from the marauding hordes.
That's exactly what the gun manufacturers want you to think, so you keep buying. They know that hunting will never again be the pastime it once was, and as more Americans move from rural areas to the suburbs and cities, their natural market withers.
Opinion: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think
That "responsible gun owner" politicians talk about, the one who reverentially passes down to his son the bolt-action rifle his father gave him? That guy isn't good for business. The manufacturers need the other guy, the one who fears he may not be all the man he could be.
Whenever that anxiety gets to be too much, he can go down to the gun store and buy another gun, and another, and a few more after that. He'll get thousands of rounds of ammunition too, because you never know what might happen. Then he'll go home and nod with satisfaction at his own little armory, telling himself that when the time comes for him to become the hero of his own action movie, he'll be ready. He's got his Man Card. And maybe he needs one or two more guns. Just to be sure.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.

Social media make us more honest
By Jeffrey Hancock, Special to CNN
updated 10:00 AM EST, Sun January 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
In 2012, deception seemed rampant in the news, says Jeffrey Hancock
He says technology enables or abets some new forms of deception
Still, studies find that people lie less frequently on LinkedIn and Facebook, he says
Hancock: People want to be perceived as truthful, especially among friends
Editor's note: Jeffrey Hancock is associate professor of communication and of information science at Cornell University. He spoke in September at TEDx Winnipeg. TED is a nonprofit dedicated to "ideas worth spreading", which it makes available through talks posted on its website.
(CNN) -- It's been an astonishing year for deception and technology. A famous author in Britain, RJ Ellory, became even more famous when he was discovered reviewing his own work, positively of course, with fake identities online. Prominent journalists were found to have plagiarized the work of others
Fake online reviews were discovered for everything from hotels to Kindle covers to doctors.
And I haven't even mentioned the presidential election.
Technology is affecting almost all aspects of human life, and deception, one of humankind's most fascinating behaviors, is no exception. Technology is making possible some interesting new forms of deception, like the butler lie, the sock puppet, and the Chinese water army.

Butler lies are those little deceptions that we tell one another to avoid social interaction. Examples include the ubiquitous "on my way" when in fact we are not on our way, or "sorry, I just got your text" when actually we just didn't want to respond right away. Another butler lie is the lost reception explanation ("I'm in a tunnel!"). Butler lies help us manage our social attention in an always-on communication world. They allow us to use the technology as a sort of social buffer to avoid interaction when we're technically always available, while at the same time giving plausible excuses to maintain social relationships we care about.
TED.com: Our buggy moral code
Sock puppets are individuals who provide reviews or commentary about their own work, usually highly positive, of course. The Internet allows for this kind of identity deception because people can chose any identity they want. But it can come with a cost when false identities are exposed. In response to the unmasking of Ellory, many authors publicly shamed him and pledged to never engage in sock puppetry.
Reviewing one's own work with a false identity isn't exactly new. Walt Whitman was infamous for doing that well before the Internet was invented. But the use of identity deception at scale, with thousands of people doing so in concert, is new. This is the Chinese Water Army phenomenon. The term refers to the large number of Chinese online writers that are paid a small amount of money to write opinions and reviews. In North America this is also commonly referred to as Astroturfing, in which an organization mimics a grass-roots movement by paying people to "spontaneously" support their position.

Prof: 'Voters unfazed by candidates' lies'
Randi Zuckerberg in photo sharing flap
It would be easy to assume that technology is growing our lying habits. But this isn't quite right. Let's consider the most important interactions, those with our friends, loved ones, and colleagues.
Does technology make us more or less likely to lie to one another? Surprisingly, a lot of research suggests that Internet technology can actually make us more honest. In several of our studies, for example, people lied less in e-mail than face to face. The place where people lie the most? The telephone.
TED.com: Why we make bad decisions
We've also looked at social network sites and the claims people make. On LinkedIn, where people post resumé information, we found that people lie less about their past responsibilities and skills than in a traditional paper-based resume. Other work shows that Facebook profiles reflect people's actual personality, rather than some idealized version.
Even in online dating, often mocked as a hotbed for lies, we found that yes, people lie, but usually not by that much. Men lie a little about their height, income and education, and women lie a little about their weight and physical appearance. This isn't really that different from meeting someone in a bar, when you think about it.
Why might technology make us more honest with each other? One reason is that people view themselves as honest and lying violates that self-concept. This is especially true when talking to people with whom we have a relationship, like our friends and family, or want to have a relationship, like future employers and dates. Being perceived as deceptive can seriously harm reputations and relationships, regardless of the medium.
The place where people lie the most? The telephone. Jeffrey Hancock
But perhaps the most important reason is that we are in an incredibly fluid era of human social evolution. Consider that humans started talking to each other about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, and over that time around a trillion humans have lived. The written word, however, only emerged about 5,000 years ago, and until World War II over half the world's population couldn't read or write. So, for most of those trillion humans, every word they ever said just disappeared. Gone. Now the average North American records more words in texts and e-mails in a day than most humans did throughout history.
This obviously has important implications for deception. Because of our social evolution we're not wired to automatically remember that our e-mails and texts and blogs and Facebook chats leave a semi-permanent record. Just ask any politician caught in a scandal in the last decade.
TED.com: The brain in love
On the plus side, these records give researchers a chance to study all sorts of social behavior that were mostly invisible before. We can use computers to analyze the language in these records and find word patterns that reveal deception, like whether a hotel review was written by someone who actually stayed at the hotel or not (take a look at the end of the TED talk to see if you can tell which hotel review is fake).
We're in a crucial change state between the era of ephemeral talk and the era of the digital trace, where everything we do and say creates our own personal record. Deception, whether we want it or not, will no doubt evolve with us as we adapt to this new world of communication. The future of lying, like the future of humanity, is wide open.

Single mom fought alongside combat troops in Afghanistan
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 8:10 AM EST, Fri January 25, 2013
Kimberly Bratic, 39, served alongside the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Afghanistan. In six months she went on 70 missions.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
An unemployed single mom with bills to pay decides to enlist in the Army
In Afghanistan, Kimberly Bratic worked with a combat team
One of her three sons struggled with her decision to leave
She just got home to Ohio and still cannot find a job
(CNN) -- Kimberly Bratic hauled her gear up Afghan mountains. She went into areas where Taliban lived. She grieved when fellow soldiers were blown up by a suicide bomber. She missed her family for a year, and heard the worry in her sons' voices when she got the rare chance to call home.
She lay awake, thinking, "What if I don't make it home?"
The only difference between the 39-year-old single mom and the men she went on 70 missions with was their job titles.
U.S. lifts ban on women in combat
The guys were combat infantry. She was a public affairs specialist, the person who documented their experience training Afghan military and police.
Policy change allows women in combat Pentagon ends ban on women in combat
Politics behind women in combat
Veterans debate women in combat roles
"I don't think the enemy would really know the difference if he decided to shoot," she wrote in a CNN iReport.
On Thursday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that the Pentagon was doing a 180 on its long-standing policy against putting women in combat roles. The branches have until mid-May to come up with a plan to implement the historic and controversial change in the next couple years.
"Mr. Panetta's decision is just unchecking a box," Bratic told CNN. "Because we're already out there and just as likely to get shot up."
She understands that men and women have different strengths and many women won't be able to endure the physical demands of training for combat positions.
Former troops say time has come for women in combat units
But she's worked with several women, including female Afghan soldiers, who definitely could.
"They want it? Give them the chance to go for it," she said.
That is all the sergeant wanted when she enlisted two and a half years ago.
Despite having a master's degree in operations management and a bachelor's degree in human resource management, Bratic was struggling to find a job in northwest Ohio.
Rent was due, the bills were piling up and she had three sons to feed.
Then one evening a friend off-handedly said that she should think about the Army.
With her education, she could likely enlist as an officer, he told her.
"I thought, 'No way, not me," Bratic recalled. "But I went online and started reading all these articles and blogs about Uncle Sam wants you."
She looked up what she might potentially earn -- $3,000 a month, including hazard pay in a war zone.
"It started making sense," she said.
But convincing herself wasn't really the problem.
Letting mom go to Afghanistan
Bratic was the kind of mother who always talked reality with her sons, then 9, 10 and 18.
They hated that their mother was often gone, juggling a couple low-paying part-time jobs, including being an adjunct professor.
"They knew I was trying to pay bills," she said. "It was hard for them. They just wanted me to come home and have family time and I just couldn't."
So she sat them down and together they looked at the websites of the National Guard and the Navy.
They just played around a bit, watched the slick videos that look so cool.
She told them what she wanted to do.
"My oldest, who was starting to think about taking care of himself, understood it," Bratic said. "But the two little ones, they were worried. My middle one had the hardest time. He was the most fearful."
The 10-year-old, Cresston, watched the news. He knew what it meant when Americans in uniform went to Iraq and Afghanistan.
By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military
But what could he do? What could the brothers really say? Mom was going to do what she felt she had to.
And if she went away, even if it was a long time, maybe afterward she would have money and they could spend more time together.
Bratic called her ex-husband. The boys' father didn't like the idea, but he was a good dad. He agreed to care for them while she was gone.
Being in a foreign country at war is frightening. Being afraid you could die is haunting. But being away from your children in that environment is uniquely anguishing.
"That mom side of you ... I couldn't look at Afghan kids. I just shut it off. You'll tear yourself up thinking about your kids," she said. "Your head has to be in the mission."
She was definitely focused.
In the span of six months, she went on 70 missions, assigned to the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. She worked closely with Brig. Gen. Abdul Habib Sayed Khail. It was the infantry's job to help train Afghan troops so that they can secure Afghanistan when the United States draws down its troops.
Bratic said her role was not only to photograph what was happening but also to serve as a mentor the Afghans, including female American and Afghan police and service members.
She also mentored Lt. Abdul Mohammed, her male Afghan public affairs counterpart.
"I felt like there was a lot of respect for me," she said. "I was older and that probably helped. But I respected them. I was a guest in their country, and my guys, the group I was with, established up front that I was to be respected."
But Bratic was constantly aware and alert, knowing about the increasing problem of "green-on-blue" attacks in which Afghans have turned their guns on their U.S. trainers and fellow Afghan soldiers.
She neither played up nor played down her gender.
"The Army is 14% female so I'm already outnumbered," she said. "You just don't think about the guys you're around as eye candy or potential husbands. But you still take care of yourself. I put my hair back every day. I wore Chapstick because my lips would get so dry. And I put eyeliner on because I look deadly without eyeliner."
A uniformed woman in Taliban country
Bratic recalls a favorite mission in Khawajah Bahawuddin in the northeastern region of Badakhshan. The area had not seen NATO forces for years, and no women.
"The potential for disaster was high. We had intel that Taliban were in the area. I had no idea how the people there would react. When we got there, everybody was eyeballing me. I was the woman, the oddity."
The plan was to be there for a while. Gen. Habib took them to a shrine to Ahmad Shah Massoud. A key political and military leader in the Afghans' fight against the Russians in the 1980s, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan. If he had not been assassinated on September 9, 2001, some believe he would have gone on to find Osama bin Laden and help the United States and its allies in a way that no one else could.
While she stood there, holding her camera, Habib told her how Massoud was killed.
His attackers pretended to be journalists doing an interview. Their camera was a bomb.
Bratic thinks about that day when people ask her why she went to Afghanistan. It started out as a way to make money, but it became about more. She is like every soldier, regardless of gender, who is changed by a war and hopes that their families get that.
When she returned to Ohio, her boys ran to her. They embraced their mom. Her son Cresston, though, needs her attention right now. He doesn't want her to leave again, and she opted to be inactive for now, with the Army Reserve. But she wants to go back badly.
Unlike many of the younger soldiers who served with her who banked their earnings, she had to constantly send money back home to pay the bills.
She's afloat for now, living again in Ohio. She spends some of her time blogging about her military experience at Afghanbattlefox.com. But mostly she's sending out resumes and making phone calls. She's still had no luck finding a job.

Artillery shells from Syria hit Lebanese border town

A man walks past bloodstains on a street in the Lebanese border town of Qasr on Sunday, after the shelling.

The military says it has deployed troops to the border region
Lebanese state media says a 13-year-old was killed when rockets hit the region
(CNN) -- Lebanon says it deployed troops near its border with Syria Sunday after artillery shells hit a Lebanese border village.
One person was killed after shells from Syria hit the town of Qasr, the Lebanese Army said in a statement.
Several homes were destroyed, and three people were injured, the military said.
"Subsequently, army units were deployed widely across the area and took measures in the field necessary to protect people and respond to the source of the attack as appropriate," the statement said.

March deadliest month in Syria war
The Lebanese military did not release additional details about the incident.
Lebanon's National News Agency reported that a 13-year-old was killed when rockets from Syria hit the region Sunday.
Lebanese President Michel Suleiman condemned the violence, saying in a statement on his website that rockets had fallen near Qasr's mosque.
"These kinds of acts have only resulted in the deaths of innocent Lebanese who have nothing to do with the ongoing conflict taking place outside their country," he said.
The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom.
That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's parliament in 2000 after his father died. The government responded with a brutal crackdown.
In February, the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people had been killed in the fighting.
At least 124 people were killed in violence throughout Syria on Sunday, the Local Coordination Committees opposition network said.
CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria.
