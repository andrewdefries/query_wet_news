The storyAlmost every day Erick Ventura wakes up, he thinks about leaving.For the past year, Ventura, 38, and his wife Trisha, 34, have been living in a cramped FEMA trailer, parked outside of their Lakeview home just a few hundred feet away from the 17th Street Canal.Before Katrina or "pre-K" as the locals say, Ventura worked in real estate and owned several rental properties. But all of that changed when the levees broke. Storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain inundated their house with 7.5 feet of water. The couple were displaced, and to make ends meet Ventura took a temporary job as a loss verifier for the Small Business Administration. His wife continued her studies in occupational therapy.

Vets pay tribute to fallen comrades at virtual Vietnam wallStory Highlights Digital Vietnam Wall memorial lets users search, leave tributes, add photos Wall was a collaboration between National Archives, Footnote.com Veterans see it as a way to add your voice to history, leave memories Local veterans hope to use site to help veterans get back on their feet Next Article in Technology » Read VIDEO SLIDESHOW By Mallory Simon CNN	ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Julius Derico Jr. didn't need to travel to the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington to pay tribute to his fallen comrade -- the first casualty of his unit in Vietnam. Users can search the digitized Vietnam War Memorial Wall for details about soldiers who died. As he huddled around a computer with other veterans, he searched for his friend's name in a newly digitized version of the Wall. While it's just one of the Wall's 58,320 names, Derico said he hopes people understand that it represents something more than just an inscription. The virtual Wall, a project created by the National Archives and Footnote.com, brings the memorial to millions of American homes. The Web site, unveiled last week, links names to casualty reports, historical documents and digital photographs, and allows users to leave online tributes to those who died. See the new project be unveiled in Washington » To create the digital image, photographers used more than 6,000 photographs of the Wall, which measures about 460 feet wide. Ten Vietnam veterans at an American Legion Post 911 in Atlanta, Georgia, gathered to test the online Wall for CNN.com. They said they believe the new Wall gives a face to each of the names, and helps keep their memories alive.

"We can use that to help console people ... To help people realize that ... they are gone but they are not forgotten," Derico said. "We can show it to you [online]. Your brother, your sister ... They're still there; they are being thought of and they are being treated with due respect." Derico will never forget. The thought of that first death in his unit still chokes him up. David Perkett was killed one night when a fellow soldier accidentally discharged his weapon. At the age of 20, Derico had to identify the body. It was not prepped. It was not cleaned. His comrade was covered in dried blood. "It was devastating," Derico said, visibly shaken. As some people searched the virtual Wall for people they knew, others shouted names from across the room, hoping someone would enter a search in the computer. Some only knew the first names and hoped to match them with the database by unit or hometown. As they found more names, the group grew in size, huddling closer together as they read the casualty report of the latest name. For Robert Love, who served in Vietnam as a mechanic, being able to view the Wall with fellow comrades gives the memorial new meaning. As he used the online version, he reflected on a trip to Washington, where he visited the Wall. "I had so many different emotions; and then after a while, as you begin to look at the names on the wall, it overwhelms you," he said. "Then you realize that you could be up there, but by the grace of God you aren't." As he sat with his fellow servicemen Friday, reflecting on the war and sharing memories of those who died, some of the pain eased. See how users are turning the wall into a personal scrapbook » As they located familiar names and learned more about them, the group's excitement grew. Everyone agreed that other veterans should know about the site, and they agreed to spread the word. Some suggested including the site Stand Down -- an event that helps homeless and indigent veterans by providing them with food, clothing and other necesseties. So many veterans end up with no home, no benefits, no money and drug problems, Love said. Many are simply stuck in a cycle, unable to let go of the horror of war. "War is hell. There's no other way to put it. And when an individual goes into a situation where he or she takes the life of another individual, it's devastating and you never really get over it," he said. "At times, when you go to sleep at night, you see just like you were there. You wake up in a cold sweat -- scared; and after so long it starts wearing on your body." "It's an excellent opportunity for them to come in and look back on what happened to them in Vietnam," Derico said. "For them to look back on the people they lost in Vietnam. And guess what? It may even shock them to the extent that they come back to reality." E-mail to a friend All About Vietnam • War and Conflict • National Archives and Records Administration

Judge: Tom DeLay to serve 3 years in prison By the CNN Wire Staff Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was sentenced Monday to serve three years in prison. STORY HIGHLIGHTSDeLay sentenced to 3 years on the conspiracy charge, 5 years on the money-laundering chargeThe judge will allow 10 years community service and probation in lieu of the laundering sentenceDeLay faced up to 99 years for money laundering and 20 years on the conspiracy chargeDeLay: "I can't feel remorseful for something I don't think I did" Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay will serve three years in prison on his November conviction on money laundering and conspiracy charges, a Texas judge ruled Monday. Judge Pat Priest sentenced DeLay to three years on the conspiracy charge and five years on the money-laundering charge. But the judge will allow DeLay to serve 10 years probation with community service on the laundering charge in lieu of the prison sentence, and the two sentences will be served concurrently. Priest remanded DeLay into custody and set a $10,000 bond pending appeal. Defense attorney Dick DeGuerin left the courthouse quickly after the sentence was announced but he spoke briefly, saying, "If I told you what I thought, I would get sued. This will not stand." Addressing the court prior to the sentencing, DeLay argued that he still doesn't believe he did anything wrong and never did anything for personal gain. "I always intended to follow the law," he said. "I'm not stupid. Everything I did I had accountants and lawyers telling me what to do and how to follow the letter of the law, even the spirit of the law." Tom DeLay faces three years in prison
2010: DeLay guilty of money laundering
DeLay: Verdict is miscarriage of justice
DeLay was found guilty in November of illegally funneling corporate money to help elect Republican candidates to the Texas legislature. "Judge, I can't be remorseful for something I don't think I did," he said. Earlier, prosecutor Steve Brandt urged the judge to send DeLay to prison, saying the once-powerful Republican showed too much disregard for the law to warrant community service and probation. "He has shown no remorse, no remorse whatsoever," said prosecutor Steve Brandt in his closing arguments. "The man, according to him, does nothing wrong." "He needs to go to prison, your honor, and he needs to go today." "If he gets probation," Brandt said, "and those people who read the newspaper tomorrow ... will say, 'I told you. He wears a tie, he gets probation.'" "I'm going to use a quote from Alexander Hamilton," he said. "'No one is above the law.'" DeGuerin countered that "no purpose would be served today by sending Tom DeLay to prison ... He lost it all already." DeGuerin stressed DeLay's lifetime of public service, detailing "his good works for his party, his state and his country," and claimed that the prosecution was "political." "We accept the jury entered its verdict, but we do not accept it," he said. "We will challenge it ... and we have the right." DeGuerin said the prosecution was based on the redistricting that took place by the new Texas legislature after the 2002 election -- an effort that changed district lines and cost several Democrats their congressional seats. "I say that the redistricting that came about ... is what motivated the prosecution to go after him," the attorney said, "because for the first time in decades, the representation represented more of the voters' make-up of Texas." At the outset of the trial, DeLay predicted he would be proclaimed innocent and called his conviction "an abuse of power" and "a miscarriage of justice." DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after being accused of funneling $190,000 to help elect Republicans to the state House and Senate in 2002. He faced a possible maximum prison term of 99 years on the money-laundering charge and 20 years on the conspiracy charge. The prosecution had asked for the full extent of punishment or "no less than 10 years confinement." The defense sought only probation. Two other men facing charges in the case are awaiting trial. DeLay, a conservative Republican, helped Newt Gingrich spearhead the GOP revival in 1994 that won control of the House and Senate in the first midterm election under Democratic President Bill Clinton. While serving as the GOP's congressional whip, DeLay earned the nickname "The Hammer" for his strict enforcement of party discipline. In 2004, he was admonished three times by the House ethics committee, which warned him to "temper" his future actions to comply with House rules. DeLay stepped aside as majority leader after his 2005 indictment on the money-laundering and conspiracy charges and resigned from Congress the following year. He fought the charges on procedural grounds for several years seeking unsuccessfully to have the trial held in his home county in suburban Houston instead of in the state capital, Austin, and blaming the indictment on a partisan prosecutor. This past summer, DeLay said a separate, long-running federal criminal investigation of his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff had been closed with no charges. Abramoff pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials. Two former DeLay aides who joined Abramoff's lobbying team after leaving Capitol Hill, also pleaded guilty during the wide-ranging influence peddling investigation. The Justice Department has declined to comment on the status of the Abramoff investigation, which also resulted in prison time for Ohio Republican Rep. Bob Ney and for Steven Griles, the No. 2 official in the Interior Department for much of the administration of President George W. Bush. On Monady, DeLay told the judge that his legal bills have topped $10 million. Despite his legal troubles, DeLay found time last year to appear as a short-lived contestant on the television show "Dancing with the Stars." He dropped out of the demanding dance competition due to stress fractures in both feet.CNN's Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.

South Africa
Johannesburg (CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela has been hospitalized for "routine tests," his foundation said Wednesday. "Mr. Mandela is at Milpark Hospital undergoing routine tests," the Nelson Mandela Foundation said in a statement. "He is in no danger and is in good spirits." Mandela was flown to the Johannesburg hospital Wednesday from Cape Town, where he was on vacation, said a source close to the Mandela family who is not authorized to speak to the media. Activity at the hospital continued as usual Wednesday afternoon, the South African Press Association said. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa told the press association on Tuesday that Mandela is "frail." "I saw him last week," Tutu said from Cape Town. "He was all right. I mean, he's 92 ... and he's frail." Mandela rarely makes public appearances. His last appearance was at the closing ceremonies of the World Cup in South Africa over the summer. He recently released a new memoir, "Conversations With Myself." Under South Africa's apartheid regime, Mandela spent 27 years in jail after being convicted of sabotage and attempts to overthrow the government. He was released in 1990 and returned to the leadership of the African National Congress party. South Africa repealed apartheid in 1991.CNN Johannesburg Bureau Chief Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.

Foreigners taxed out of Hong Kong property?
By Ramy Inocencio, CNN
updated 2:11 AM EST, Tue November 13, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Foreigners are taxed additional 15% for purchasing new homes in Hong Kong
New property tax comes after 9% of home purchases by mainland Chinese
Chinese would-be home buyer calls new policy "unfair"
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Many of Hong Kong's foreign residents will have to think twice before buying a new home in this Asian financial hub.
In a surprise move last month to curb skyrocketing property prices, the Hong Kong government announced the immediate implementation of a 15% property tax on all home purchases -- by foreigners.
The fallout has been fast.
"I think it's a harsh measure," says Brock Little, an Australian who has called Hong Kong home the past six years.
Little, a realtor with local agency Island Property, says the anti-foreigner tax has priced some of his western clients out of the market.

"Some of them who've been here for three to five years...now they basically see Hong Kong as not very welcoming, not really accommodating, to setting up permanently," he says.
Little adds the tax fails to match Hong Kong's image as a world-class city and that some of his clients are now thinking about leaving.
But the Hong Kong government sees the tax as a necessary policy to protect the city's economy from an inflating property bubble -- fueled not just by foreign investment but also by low interest rates linked to protracted quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and limited supply of new housing on the market.
In just the first nine months of this year, average property prices in Hong Kong jumped 20%. Since the start of 2010, the price ballooned 50%.
This has made Hong Kong's property sector a dream for established homeowners but a nightmare for potential buyers.
"Hong Kong is the most expensive of our cities in which to purchase property," wrote Savills, a global real estate services provider, in its Spring 2012 World Cities Review. The city is pricier than Singapore, London, Tokyo and Paris, Savills found.
Savills added Hong Kong's property market "is in a league of its own."
Mainland Chinese targeted While Hong Kong's new tax affects a broad swath of Hong Kong's foreign population, property experts say the real bull's-eye is on the backs of a more specific group of buyers flush with new wealth from right across the border in China.
"I think it's mainly focusing on mainland buyers," says Buggle Lau, chief analyst for Midland Realty, one of Hong Kong's largest real estate companies.
He says he does not totally agree with the new tax policy, but that it is something the government has to do.
"Over the past two years and three quarters, we roughly estimate about 9% of the buyers (of Hong Kong property) are from the mainland," says Lau.
In absolute terms, it may not sound like much, but Lau asserts it is "a pretty big chunk compared to the annual supply of residential units in Hong Kong."
He says just 8,000 to 10,000 new residential units come online every year -- a supply bottleneck that keeps the city's property prices climbing.
With the tax in force, Lau forecasts a 2% to 3% drop in the number of mainland Chinese investors in Hong Kong property. This figure is expected to be 5% in the next six months.
"Unfair"
Jason Liang, 27, is one of the first mainland Chinese in Hong Kong to be hit by the new tax.
Two years ago, he moved to the city as a student, then parlayed his diploma into a financial relations job after graduation.
Liang and his wife planned to buy his first Hong Kong home in December and had already prepared a 20% down payment. The new tax dashed their dreams, literally overnight.
"It is unfair, emotionally it is unfair for me," he said. "It's a surprising policy because I think Hong Kong is a very free market (and) they don't want to curb any investments."
Liang stressed that he is different from other mainlanders, many of whom are believed to be speculators driving the city's property bubble.
"Most of the speculators are from mainland China," he says. "For me, I'm also from mainland China, but I'm [part of] the people who work here, have a stable salary, and I just want to buy affordable houses, instead of renting a place at a high price."
But he understands the new tax does not differentiate based on intent - only on immigrant status.
Interest rates, property supply
Looking ahead, Lau, the real estate analyst, predicts Hong Kong's anti-foreigner property tax may stay in effect through 2015 when the city's interest rates may rebound and when new property is expected to become available, according to government estimates.
But he cautions against any expectations of a price crash saying "property prices will remain flat or soften a little bit" over the next six months.
In the meantime, many would-be buyers will wait out the life of the tax, sitting on their money until the policy ends.
Liang says he plans to stay in Hong Kong for the long haul.
"Comparing with mainland China, it is still a better place," Liang says. "It is still a free market for me. So I love it here, I still love it here."

Manchester United teams up with first two Chinese sponsors
By Ramy Inocencio, for CNN
updated 1:16 AM EST, Wed January 16, 2013
Manchester United fans look on as the team arrives for a team training session at Shanghai Stadium in Shanghai on July 24, 2012. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Man Utd announces major sponsorship deals with two popular Chinese companies Wahaha beverage maker to be Man Utd's first official drinks partner in China
China Construction Bank to be club's first team-up with Chinese financial firm
Value of sponsorship deals not revealed
Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a first for Manchester United, the English professional football club today announced major sponsorship deals with not one, but two, popular Chinese companies -- each in a three-year deal.
While the value of those agreements have not been revealed, Chinese beverage giant Wahaha will become Manchester United's first official soft drinks partner in the country. China Construction Bank, the country's second largest bank by market value, will be the club's first deal with a Chinese financial institution.
Wahaha, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, says it has been China's biggest beverage maker over the past 11 years. Its bottled water, energy drinks and yogurt are ubiquitous from the urban markets of Beijing and Shanghai to rural stalls in the snowy mountains of the Tibetan plateau.
"Wahaha is one of the most iconic brands in China ... what better way to endorse this modern-day success story than to partner with the number one club in the world's biggest sport," said Richard Arnold, Manchester United's commercial director, in a news release.
Arnold added that the football club has had a long association with China dating back to 1975 with the club's first friendly match in the country.
Under the second deal, China Construction Bank gains exclusive rights to market the official Manchester United-branded credit card in China. CCB says it will start advertising the product to its nearly 102 million personal banking customers.
"In 80 major cities in China, CCB have almost 60% of all branches, making them the ideal partner to connect with our fans," said United's Arnold. "Financial services products give us tangible ways of providing real benefits to our fans that enable them to establish a closer relationship with their favorite team."
United's Chinese sponsorship deals are just the latest in a series of at least a dozen agreements with global brand names in 2012 as the club has tried to pay down debts from a 2005 takeover. Most notably, last year the club signed a $559 million sponsorship with Chevrolet for a seven-year shirt agreement.
In November, the club said its current debt stood at more than $640 million.
After Manchester United's two Chinese sponsorship deals were announced, its share price on the New York Stock Exchange rallied 5.23%, peaking in intraday trade to a record high.

JetBlue introduces premium class seats
By Katia Hetter, CNN
updated 3:51 PM EDT, Mon September 30, 2013
JetBlue is introducing premium seating on its flights between New York and San Francisco, and New York and Los Angeles.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
JetBlue switches to two-class service in some markets
The new "Mint" service will offer lie-flat beds in domestic business class
The new seats are only available on selected routes
(CNN) -- One size no longer fits all at JetBlue Airways.
Fully-flat beds, private suites, dual power outlets with USB ports, amenity kits and Saxon+Parole-designed tapas menu are part of JetBlue's new premium "Mint" seating, the airline announced Monday.
By making the business class service available on flights between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport starting in summer 2014 and New York's Kennedy Airport and San Francisco International Airport starting in fall 2014, the airline is hoping to woo business class customers from traditional carriers on those lucrative New York routes.
"Mint is JetBlue's refreshing take on a premium class product. It is stylish service minus all of the stuffiness often associated with the traditional front-of-the-cabin experience," said JetBlue President and CEO Dave Barger in a statement.
"JetBlue is truly all about serving the under-served, the customer who wants to enjoy first-rate service at an exceptional and affordable fare. We believe Mint is better than other airlines' first and business class service, and with fares that make it accessible to everyone, we think Mint will become the obvious choice for customers flying across the country."
JetBlue plans to dedicate 11 new Airbus A321s for the two routes, each with 16 lie-flat seats (and four of those are private suites).
Coach customers will also see some improvements: The new Airbus A321 aircraft will offer free Wi-Fi and in-seat power outlets for all customers and increased audio and television programing in coach seating.
JetBlue's first "Mint" flight will depart Kennedy Airport for Los Angeles on June 15, 2014 at 9:30 a.m. Fares are now on sale for $499 one-way from New York to Los Angeles for travel between June 15 and June 18, 2014.

For North Korea, the war isn't over, says freed U.S. vet Merrill Newman
By Dana Ford, CNN
updated 6:11 PM EST, Mon December 9, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Another American is still being held by North Korean authorities
Merrill Newman, 85, was detained in October
He returned to the United States this weekend
"The North Koreans seem to have misinterpreted my curiosity," he says
(CNN) -- Until he returned home this weekend, Merrill Newman -- an American held in North Korea -- had no idea what a story he'd become.
During his detention, the 85-year-old veteran of the Korean War had no access to news. He has since seen the flood.
"Looking at the television and newspaper reports, I've seen a lot of speculation about why I was detained. I've given considerable thought to this and have come to the conclusion that I just didn't understand that, for the North Korean regime, the Korean War isn't over and that even innocent remarks about the war can cause big problems if you are a foreigner," he said in a statement Monday.
Newman traveled in October as a tourist to North Korea on a 10-day organized tour. Authorities nabbed him just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang.

Expand: The photos N. Korea banned
In his statement, Newman describes what he thinks might have set them off.
"I innocently asked my North Korean guides whether some of those who fought in the war in the Mount Kuwol area might still be alive, and expressed an interest in possibly meeting them if they were. The North Koreans seem to have misinterpreted my curiosity as something more sinister," he wrote.
"It is now clear to me the North Koreans still feel much more anger about the war than I realized. With the benefit of hindsight, I should have been more sensitive to that."
For weeks, the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman.
An explanation finally came last month, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's "apology." The word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions.
In the note dated November 9, Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol unit, part of the "intelligence bureau" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect "information" and wage deadly attacks.
"After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said, according to that report.
In his statement, Newman distanced himself from those comments.
"Anyone who has read the text of it or who has seen the video of me reading it knows that the words were not mine and were not delivered voluntarily. Anyone who knows me knows that I could not have done the things they had me 'confess' to," he wrote.
Newman said he was treated well during his detention.
His release coincided with a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to South Korea, where he laid a wreath in honor of those who died in the war that pitted North against South.
A senior administration official said that Newman's release was the result of direct contact between Washington and Pyongyang. The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered.
Newman thanked Biden, the U.S. State Department, the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang and family and friends in his statement.
He also asked that people not forget Kenneth Bae, another American being held in North Korea. Bae was arrested in 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years for so-called hostile acts and attempts to topple the government.
"I know there is a lot of interest in this, and I'll do my best to answer as many questions as I can," wrote Newman.
"For now, let me finish by saying again how great it is to be back home, safe, and with my loved ones."

Would you want Google Glass in class?
By Emanuella Grinberg, CNN
updated 1:35 PM EST, Tue February 11, 2014
A young student uses Google Glass to record his work in art class at the Episcopal Academy in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. Margaret Powers, who coordinates technology for the private school's youngest students, was selected for Google's Glass Explorer program, which allows people to test the wearable computer.
After a recent run of winter weather, kindergarten students at the Episcopal Academy used Google Glass to explain what they know about snowflakes. Powers created a blog, 365 Days of Glass, to record how students and educators at the school are using the product.
Three students, including one wearing Google Glass, work together after school to decorate the DIY Maker Club flag. A second-grader used Glass to shoot photos and videos and document the flag's creation.
A pre-kindergarten student wears Google Glass while painting with watercolors for a community service project. He documented how crayon and watercolors interact, and the work was eventually sent to be place mats at a local Ronald McDonald House. A second-grade student shot this photo with Glass while he worked on a class e-book about the Lenape people and culture.
A pre-kindergarten student used Glass to record interactions with chickens while on a field trip to a farm.
A kindergarten student took this photo with Glass while working in the school garden. She was planting a bulb for spring and discovered a worm.
A kindergarten student works to trace his own hand and record the process with Glass. He worked on a fall tree with paper and pastels during a fall festival celebration. After helping to construct a teepee with a guest presenter who came to the school, a second-grade student took this picture to show the view from the inside.
Powers captured this photo to document her first-grade students' research on penguins. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A handful of teachers have started using Google Glass in their classrooms
It's used for virtual field trips, to document lab work and reveal students' perspectives
The cost, battery life and privacy concerns might keep it out of schools, teachers said
(CNN) -- When high schoolers tour the world's largest nuclear research facility from their desks, or teachers have a chance to see the classroom through students' eyes, that's the power of Google Glass.
But even as Google's much buzzed-about wearable computer makes its way into the hands of technophiles, law enforcement and firefighters, it might be a while before it comes to a school near you.
Slowly, Google Glass is starting to turn up in schools. A handful of educators are beta testers in Google's Glass Explorer Program.
They're capturing videos and images of classroom activities through a small camera built into Glass' frame, and sharing them online. They use Glass to teach lessons from their perspective to share with others, or for their own reference. They're propping the glasses on students, and using the footage and images from young people to understand what they see and how they learn.
Even with limited applications and functionality in these early versions of Google Glass, some teachers and technology enthusiasts see huge potential.
"The possibilities are endless as more applications are developed for the device and as Glass gets into the hands of more teachers and students," said Kathy Schrock, a former librarian and technology consultant who serves on the board of International Society for Technology in Education.
"Having a single pair of Google Glass in the classroom reminds me of the days of the one-computer classroom. Everyone had to wait for a turn to use the device," Schrock, a Google Certified Teacher, said in an e-mail. "I think once we see a K-12 school pilot with a classroom set of Glass, there will be many more practical and creative uses showcased."
Margaret Powers wore Google Glass while introducing Pre-K students to a Mars rover augmented reality app.
The virtual field trip is often touted as a use for Glass, and there are apps in development expected to display information about locations the Glass wearer sees.
Google sent online educator Andrew Vanden Heuvel to Switzerland in 2013 so he could lead students on a virtual tour of the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research known as CERN. Through a Google+ hangout, students from South Christian High School in Michigan watched Vanden Heuvel walk through the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, taking their questions and pointing out features.
Even more common, educators broadcast from inside the classroom, leading science labs, group discussions or even performing surgery for remote audiences. They show it in real time through Google+ hangouts and as videos shared later through YouTube, personal blogs and other forms of social media.
After his field trip, Vanden Heuvel continued using Glass by making a series of instructional science and math videos called STEMBites. When a New Jersey high school student had to miss school for medical reasons, chemistry teacher Marc Seigel asked the student's friend to wear Glass during science labs and broadcast them to her in a Google+ hangout. An online group for Glass Explorers in Education lets users share similar stories and pose questions to the group of 612 members.
But Google Glass in every classroom could be a long way off. There's a long list of reasons why the most intriguing device in tech just isn't ready for school: Glass is expected to be more widely available toward the end of 2014, but the $1,500 price tag is a significant barrier for schools and teachers. So far, there's no educational discount, teachers said, and Google hasn't announced plans to partner with educational institutions. Its short battery life needs to be resolved before broader implementation is possible, teachers said, and Glass is mired in privacy concerns, especially when children are involved.
"To me, the greatest value of Glass so far isn't what it's able to do, but the conversation being had nationally about how we interact with technology and how we want it to be part of society," said Vanden Heuvel, who teaches online math and science classes.
Vanden Heuvel views Glass as another tool in his arsenal, but it's "not necessarily the best for every situation," he said.
"I think the $1,500 would be better spent on three Chromebooks," he said.
Still, early adopters in education are looking for ways to make it work. Margaret Powers, lower school technology coordinator at the Episcopal Academy in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, has been documenting her experiences using Glass in class on on her blog, 365 Days of Glass. She saw potential in Glass as a tool to capture moments of discovery and learning through her students' eyes, in line with the Reggio Emilia philosophy she embraces as an educator.
Don't miss out on the conversation! Follow us on Twitter @CNNschools or on CNN Living on Facebook for the latest stories and to share your perspective.
Since April 2013, she's used Glass to document the day's activities and post video highlights online. Glass gives her the benefit of doing it hands-free, so she can maintain eye contact and interact with students while gathering information, she said.
Periodically, she puts together video clips around specific topics, like teaching students about coding, as presentations for parents. She lets students use the device to document their experience making Native crafts or playing in the snow to share with partner classrooms around the country.
Among its greatest benefits so far? Powers said she can finally see the classroom through the eyes of her students, who range from pre-K to second grade. It shows which details catch their attention, and sometimes reveals simple problems, like when Powers realized she was posting some information too high for her young students to see.
"It has been really interesting to try it because their perspective is so unique and different from ours, which is why I think (Glass) has a lot of potential with these age ranges," she said. "To get just a few moments to see how they learn to do a math problem, or to get a sense of their vantage point is so great for teachers."

Why L.A. transit strike matters to more than city's poor
By Greg LaMotte
CNN Correspondent
This news analysis was written for CNN Interactive.
MTA buses and trains have not been running since the transit strike started Saturday in Los Angeles
In this story:
The 'mass' in transit
National headaches from local traffic
Just don't shut down the freeways
RELATED STORIES, SITES
LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- What are the worst two words a person could utter in New York City? How about, "transit strike"?
Wait. Don't panic. There has not been a transit strike in New York in 20 years. Why?
Maybe it is because the mass transportation system there really is for the masses. Anyone and everyone, including power brokers and politicians, routinely use the subways and buses in New York. The city's lifestyle revolves around its mass transit system.
Maybe that is why New York has adopted laws that make it extraordinarily difficult for mass transit workers to strike.
Such is not the case in Los Angeles.
In the nation's second largest city few people seem to care that some 4,300 bus and train operators went on strike Saturday, and fewer people are affected. Many residents initially did not even know a strike had begun as they waited at stops for buses and trains that did not come.
The fact is, mass transportation in Los Angeles is not for the masses.
The 'mass' in transit In car-happy southern California, mass transportation is not that important to the people who make policy in Los Angeles, according to Wendell Cox, a former top official with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and now a consultant to transit unions.
A Los Angeles bus driver on Wednesday urges motorists to honk their horns in support of the strike Mass transit here is primarily for the poor. A majority of the estimated half-million users of the city's mass transit system earn around $15,000 or less a year, and 75 percent of them do not own a car, according to the MTA.
What is more, just 3 percent of commuters here rely on mass transit.
So when it comes to Los Angeles, the people who can least afford a transit strike are the ones who are being affected the most. Yet these are the people with the least political clout.
Maybe that is why, at least in part, there have been seven transit strikes in Los Angeles over the past 30 years. In the 1970s, union workers went on strike almost every time they were negotiating new contracts.
National headaches from local traffic The current strike-related issues in Los Angeles could have ramifications for transportation systems nationwide.
Here is why. In rapidly expanding cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, and Atlanta, Georgia, transportation officials are making decisions about how to expand their transportation infrastructures.
New York City, with its massive bus and subway system, provides one example. Los Angeles, which decades ago chose to emphasize freeways, provides another. For cities contemplating their own transit needs, some transportation experts in Los Angeles say the strike here should make city planners nationwide aware of what can be added costs of providing safe, reliable, bus and rail service. The latest strike in Los Angeles is primarily over the issue of overtime pay. The MTA says it faces a shortfall of $438 million over 10 years unless something is done.
The MTA wants to cut back on overtime in order to save $23 million over three years. The striking United Transportation Union says the MTA should raise fares. The city says those who use the system cannot afford a fare increase. The union says it cannot afford to lose overtime.
In 1974, when the city's longest such strike lasted 68 days, transportation unions got the city to agree to pay bus and rail operators for hours between split shifts. The operators do not drive buses or trains during those hours between the two blocks of time of their workdays, but they do get paid for them.
That is where a lot of overtime enters the books. And that issue is now one of the main sticking points in Los Angeles because city officials would like, at the very least, to cut back on pay for the hours between split shifts.
Some MTA officials suggest these kinds of costs, along with the potential costs of union strikes, should be taken into consideration by city planners and state legislators nationwide.
Just don't shut down the freeways The fact is that any transportation system has its advantages and disadvantages.
There are overcrowded subways that sometimes fail in New York City. And there are overcrowded freeways in Los Angeles that often cause major headaches and lots of pollution.
MESSAGE BOARD
Los Angeles Transit Strike
But regardless of a city's transportation system, most people, regardless of where they live in a city, seem to figure out a way to make it work for them. One way or the other the transit strike in Los Angeles will be resolved, and the buses and trains will run again. That will certainly be good news to those who depend on it. For many others here, the transit strike will have been only a story they heard about on the local news.
