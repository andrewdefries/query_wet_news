Preacher killed wife, stuffed body in freezer, police sayStory Highlights NEW: Anthony Hopkins denied bail at initial court appearance Preacher is charged with murder, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and incest He was arrested after delivering sermon at his Alabama church Case began when daughter told police she'd been sexually abused Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- An evangelical preacher killed his wife several years ago and stuffed her body in a freezer after she caught him abusing their daughter, according to police and court documents. Anthony Hopkins appeared in court Thursday to face murder, rape and incest charges. Anthony Hopkins, 37, was arrested Monday night at the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ in Jackson, Alabama, just after he had delivered a sermon to a congregation that included his seven other children, officials said. He faces charges including murder, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and incest. Hopkins was denied bail Thursday when he appeared before Mobile County District Judge George Hardesty. The case is set for arraignment next week, Hardesty's clerk said. The case began Monday, when the daughter, now 19, went to the Mobile Police Department's Child Advocacy Center and reported that she had been sexually abused by Hopkins since she was 11 years old, according to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant of the preacher's home in Mobile. The affidavit related the daughter's story as follows: Her mother, Arletha Hopkins, 36, caught her father abusing her in a bathroom in November 2004. Afterward, her parents argued, and her mother locked her father out of the house. The father came to the daughter's window and asked her to let him in, and she did so. The next morning, her father asked her to help him hide her mother's body in the freezer in the laundry room of the home. The girl said she moved out of the home about two weeks ago and was living with a neighbor. She told police that her mother's body was still in the freezer. When authorities went to the home, no one was there, as Hopkins and the other children were at the church. A body was found in the freezer, the affidavit says. Although police think the body is that of Arletha Hopkins, an identification is not expected until early next week, Mobile Police spokesman Officer Eric Gallichant said Thursday. Watch Nancy Grace's report » Mobile Police Chief Phillip Garrett had said that an identification and autopsy results would take a few days: "obviously, the body was in a freezer." He said he was not sure of the body's condition or whether it was intact, as upon seeing the body, authorities immediately sealed the chest-type freezer. The body had been covered in the unit, he said, and the entire appliance was taken to the state Department of Forensic Science. At the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ, Hopkins was preaching at a revival, pastor Beverly Jackson told CNN affiliate WKRG. His message, she said, was about forgiveness and not passing judgment -- and at one point, he turned to his seven children and asked them to forgive him his past, present and future. Police allowed Hopkins to finish his sermon before arresting him, Jackson said. She said she asked police why they were arresting him and was told, "he murdered his wife." She said Hopkins had told her his wife died four years ago while giving birth to their youngest son. Attempts to reach Jackson on Thursday were unsuccessful. Authorities moved quickly on the daughter's accusations to make sure the children still in the household were OK, Garrett said. They were placed in the custody of child welfare authorities. The next-oldest child is a 17-year-old female, he said. All eight were the children of Arletha Hopkins, and Anthony Hopkins fathered six of them, he said. An investigation has not found any record of Arletha Hopkins' existence since 2004, according to the affidavit. Asked how long police think the body had been in the freezer, Garrett said, "I'm thinking that she's probably been there for a number of years." He said Anthony Hopkins did not have a regular church but apparently preached in various areas around the South. "Part of the mystery here is that, apparently, none of these children were in school" but were being home-schooled, Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson said. "Home schooling, under this situation, removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe." Pastor Jerry Porter said he used to preach with Hopkins at his church, the Williams Street Holiness Church, and knew the family. Arletha Hopkins "was very quiet," he told Mobile television station and CNN affiliate WPMI. "She was kind of secluded. She'd talk, but not much." Anthony Hopkins, he said, made statements that led him to believe all was not well at home. "He always used to tell me ... 'You're blessed in the fact that you have a wife that supports you and what you're trying to do for God,' " Porter said. He said Arletha Hopkins disappeared shortly after the couple's youngest child was born. As rumors swirled, Porter said, he confronted Hopkins and asked whether his wife was dead. Hopkins "wouldn't give me an answer," he said. After that, Porter said, he banned him from the church but remained on good terms with him. He said he visited the family a few years ago, and their home was clean and well-kept. "It was the ideal family. I mean, the children were so respectful, just so easygoing," Porter said. "Didn't seem to be no stress at all. Never got that impression, never." The children, he said, "loved their dad. They were very close to him." Of Hopkins' preaching ability, Porter said, "he was a bulls-eye prophet. If he told you something, you could pretty much bank on it."

Fisher leads Lakers to brink of NBA titleStory Highlights The LA Lakers defeat Orlando Magic 99-91 to take a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals Point guard Derek Fisher scores two late three-pointers to help secure victory Lakers will secure first NBA title since 2002 if they win Game Five on SundayNext Article in World Sport » (CNN) -- The LA Lakers are on the brink of winning the 2009 NBA finals after two late three-pointers from Derek Fisher helped seal a 99-91 victory over the Magic in Game Four in Orlando, moving them 3-1 ahead in the best-of-seven series. Derek Fisher's two late three-pointer helped give the Lakers a 3-1 advantage in the NBA finals. Point guard Fisher had failed in all his three-point attempts prior to sinking one at the end of the fourth quarter to tie the match at 87-87 -- and added another in overtime to seal victory for the Lakers -- to finish with 12 points in 42 minutes of playing time. "My team-mates and my coaches kept giving me that confidence to continue to believe in myself," Fisher told the official Lakers Web site. "I wanted to come through for those guys."

Orlando to face Lakers in NBA finals
Fisher's three-point ability is legendary. In his first stint with the Lakers, he hit a three-pointer on the buzzer to give them a 74-73 victory over San Antonio in the 2004 quarterfinals, a series they went on to win. Kobe Bryant finished with 32 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Lakers -- while Trevor Ariza and Pau Gasol each scored 16 points as the Lakers fought back from a 12-point half-time deficit. The Lakers can close out the series and collect their first NBA title since 2002, and the 15th in their history, with another victory over the Magic at the Amway Arena on Sunday.

'Follow Friday': NASA, space and lunar crashesStory Highlights "Follow Friday," a new CNN.com feature, recommends Twitter feeds on a news topic Today's topic: space-related tweets, NASA's plan to crash spacecraft on the moon "Astro Mike" Massimino is an NASA astronaut with 1 million Twitter followers Twitter feed of the LCROSS mission is written from the point of view of the spacecraftNext Article in Technology » Editor's note: In this new weekly feature, we highlight five recommended Twitter feeds about a hot topic in the news. Today's list focuses on space-related tweets and NASA's plan to crash two spacecraft on the moon Friday in a search for water in lunar soil. A NASA rendering of the LCROSS spacecraft entering a debris plume on its way to the moon. (CNN) -- 1. NASA's Ames Research Center -- This Silicon Valley-based complex is ground zero for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission, which climaxes with Friday's lunar crashes. Officials invited the public to spend the night outdoors at the center to watch the crashes occur shortly after 4:30 a.m. California time. Ames staffers' enthusiasm for the LCROSS mission is evident in their breathless tweets, which are full of exclamation points! Number of followers: more than 3,500 Sample tweet: Brace for Impact! A Schedule of Events for the Final Day http://bit.ly/S8mzy 2. "Astro Mike" -- That would be Mike Massimino, a NASA astronaut who has flown two space shuttle missions. On May 12 of this year, during a Hubble servicing mission on the shuttle Atlantis, Massimino became the first person to tweet from space. He's since become far and away the most popular space-themed Twitterer. Number of followers: more than 1,066,000 Sample tweet: "Flew in a T-38 this morning, got to cloud surf-flying just above the clouds like a big fluffy blanket below going 350 mph." 3. BadAstronomer -- Phil Plait isn't a bad astronomer, just a self-described skeptic who hates bad astronomy. The Boulder, Colorado-based lecturer and author writes a witty blog -- called, strangely enough, Bad Astronomy -- that delights in poking holes in wacky or misinformed theories about space. Yes, moon-landing hoax theorists, he means you. Number of followers: more than 21,000 Sample tweet: "Man, if you're too busy to write 140 chars, you're too busy. I am that busy." 4. astroengine -- Astroengine is the Twitter name of Ian O'Neill, a British-born physicist with a long resume and a healthy sense of humor. It's also the name of his blog, which gathers articles and posts on such light-reading topics as quantum mechanics, solar physics, relativity, cosmology, space flight science and "some of the more bizarre theories that drive our universe." Number of followers: more than 1,700 Sample tweet: "Europa, Jupiter's Moon, Could Support Complex Life http://bit.ly/3n6iKL (I, for one, welcome our alien Jellyfish Overlords)" 5. LCROSS_NASA -- The official Twitter feed of the LCROSS moon mission, it's written from the point of view of the spacecraft. That's right -- if the satellite could tweet before smacking into the moon, this is what it might say. Most tweets give updates on the craft's position in the sky, beginning with the Waldo-esque question, "Where am I now?" Number of followers: more than 10,000 Sample tweet: "Where am I now? Travelin' 1.20km/s(2682mph). 51,336km from the Moon. Did you know you can watch the impact on NASA TV? http://ub0.cc/hM/1Y"

The U.S. will renew sanctions push in light of alleged Iranian plot
From Elise Labott and Jessica Yellin, CNN
updated 11:04 AM EDT, Wed October 12, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The U.S. will be looking for countries to do more on Iranian sanctions, a top official says
Secretary of State Clinton and others will be making calls, the senior State official says
The diplomatic corps is to be briefed, another senior State Department official says
Washington (CNN) -- The United States will be looking for nations around the world to get tougher on Iran in the wake of the alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, a senior State Department official said Tuesday.
The official said that although Iran is under multiple sanctions, many countries are not enforcing the restrictions, and sometimes if they have problems with Iran, they don't speak out publicly.
The official said the United States is going to be looking for countries to enforce existing sanctions, implement new ones and cut ties with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, to basically match what the United States has already done.
To make the case, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other senior officials in the department are going to be placing calls to leaders and foreign ministers, U.N. Security Council members and others with influence on Iran, the official said.
Iranian amb: Terror plot is 'big lie'
U.S.: Iranian assassination plot stopped
Iran accused in other terror plots Why Iranian plot was planned for U.S.
The official said the United States is looking for what Clinton calls a "chorus of international condemnation" of Iran.
A senior administration official, asked if there will be sanctions on more individuals related to this particular plot, responded, "We've done what we think is the network here."
Asked what actions the United States would take next, the official said, "We are continuing to look for additional ways to apply financial sanctions on Iran. We are very much in the business of increasing pressure on Iran through sanctions so Iran understands they have a clear choice to be made between coming to the table seriously (and) meaningfully, and facing further isolation and sanction.
"We're continuing on that course."
Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns plans brief the diplomatic corps Wednesday at the State Department on the alleged Iran plot, a second senior department official said Tuesday.
The official described it as an "informational briefing" and said that Burns will explain the details of how it went down, how the Obama administration handled it and the need to hold Iran accountable.
A third senior State Department official told CNN that the briefing will also try to allay any concerns that were raised in diplomats by word of an assassination plot against an ambassador in Washington. The official said the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security is working with the Secret Service and "taking all appropriate measures" to protect foreign diplomats and diplomatic facilities.
Saudi Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir has always had his own State Department Diplomatic Security detail, as have previous Saudi ambassadors.

NY hospital staff stayed with patients too ill to move during Irene By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Patients return to evacuated hospitalsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSAs Irene approached, 6 patients were too sick to evacuate from NYU-Langone Medical CenterThe hospital is just 100 yards from the East RiverNurses kept flashlights by each bedside, and a 3-day medicine supply for each patient"We train for these disasters," says nurse manager Elaine Rowinski (CNN) -- When New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg instructed five hospitals to evacuate their patients from Hurricane Irene's path, one replied it couldn't follow his order. Administrators from New York University-Langone Medical Center explained that six patients in the intensive care unit were so sick that moving them might kill them, and so the mayor's office gave permission to keep them in the hospital throughout the storm. It then fell to Elaine Rowinski, nurse manager of the intensive care unit, to find seven nurses willing to stay at the hospital, right in the hurricane's predicted path and just 100 yards from the East River, which many feared would overflow. It turned out she had nothing to worry about. "I could have had 20 nurses if I'd needed them," she said. "That's how many called me up to volunteer." Rowinski stayed at the hospital all weekend as the doctors and nurses who also stayed listened to the wind and the rain through the boarded-up windows. "I had no qualms about staying, no fears at all," she said. "We train for these disasters." A look back at Irene and its aftermath
Brainstorming with her staff, Rowinski came up with a list of what they might need during the storm. The nurses kept flashlights by each bedside and plugged machines into the red outlets on the wall, which connect to the generators on top of the building, in case they lost power from Con Edison. They also kept a three-day supply of medicine next to each patient's bed in the event they needed to evacuate quickly. About 200 staff members stayed at NYU, including engineers, security guards, housekeepers, blood bank staff, and two doctors. Four family members stayed all weekend with the patients. Some of the patients had neurological diseases, while others had respiratory problems or infectious diseases. Many were on life support, but those that were conscious were told Friday they might have to be evacuated. "They were so relieved when they found out they could stay," Rowinski said. As for Rowinski, she finally went home Monday afternoon after nearly three days straight at the hospital. While she was working, her husband had to evacuate their house in Oceanside, on Long Island. "He told me he kept a picture of me by the dog so he'd remember me," she said with a laugh.CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.

Republican House member resigns over 'profound mistakes' From Dana Bash, CNN 'Craigslist' congressman resignsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSRep. Christopher Lee of New York just began his second termLee, who is married, reportedly responded to a woman's ad on Craigslist"I regret the harm that my actions have caused my family, my staff and my constituents" Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Christopher Lee of New York resigned his House seat Wednesday after a report that the married congressman had tried to meet a woman on Craigslist. "It has been a tremendous honor to serve the people of Western New York," Lee said in a statement posted on his website. "I regret the harm that my actions have caused my family, my staff and my constituents. I deeply and sincerely apologize to them all. I have made profound mistakes and I promise to work as hard as I can to seek their forgiveness." The statement said that "the challenges we face in Western New York and across the country are too serious for me to allow this distraction to continue, and so I am announcing that I have resigned my seat in Congress effective immediately." Just before 6 p.m., an announcement read on the House floor said Lee had resigned as of 5 p.m. Wednesday, and the number of the House members decreased by one from 435 to 434.

Lee, who is married and has a son, resigned after the website Gawker published an item reporting that he corresponded with a woman who posted a Craigslist ad and allegedly sent her a bare-chested photo of himself. The speed of Lee's resignation indicated a culture of zero tolerance by House Republicans for potentially controversial behavior so soon after winning control of the chamber for the first time since 2007. Lee was first elected to Congress in 2008 from New York's 26th district in the western part of the state, which includes suburbs of both Buffalo and Rochester. He won re-election in November.CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this story.

Opposition: Fighting across Syria leaves 151 dead
From Ivan Watson, CNN
updated 7:13 PM EST, Thu November 22, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: By Thursday, another 76 people had been killed in the fighting, opposition groups say
Rebels say a Syrian airstrike hits near Aleppo hospital
Turkey requests Patriot missiles amid concern over "threats and risks" from Syrian crisis
NATO says the missiles would demonstrate solidarity in the alliance
Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- One day after Syrian rebels accused government forces of a deadly bombing near a hospital in the besieged city of Aleppo, opposition groups said another 151 people had been killed in the fighting Thursday.
The majority of those deaths occurred in the Syrian capital of Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group.
Another 34 were killed in Aleppo, where some of the heaviest fighting has occurred.
The 20-month civil war has claimed more than 42,000 lives, according to the latest tally from the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. The group counts 3,133 government soldiers among the dead.
And the bloodletting has since carried on unabated while also threatening regional stability.

On Wednesday, 15 people died in the strike on a building next to the Dar al-Shifa Hospital, including two children and a doctor.
Ralib al-Omar, a leader of the Yusif al-Asma rebel group, said the strike had targeted the hospital and that the dead included two nurses. A doctor was among the dead -- one of 40 people killed in Aleppo on Wednesday and 113 across the country.
Dar al-Shifa is one of the main sources of medical help for people in Syria's commercial hub. In video posted by opposition activists, the blast appeared to have affected the hospital's often-crowded front lobby.
Amanpour blog: U.S. has no plan for Syria
Protests first broke out against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. Al-Assad responded by turning the army and police on the demonstrations.
The government-owned Syrian Arab News Agency reported a series of clashes between security forces and "armed terrorist groups," while intense fighting near the Syrian-Turkish border in recent weeks has pitted loyalist Syrian forces against the rebel Free Syrian Army.
CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria.
In a sign of a potential escalation of the conflict, Turkey asked its NATO allies for Patriot missiles Wednesday to bolster its air defenses against its southern neighbor. A letter to NATO included the "formal request" that the alliance send "air defense elements," according to a Turkish government statement that cited "the threats and risks posed by the continuing crisis in Syria to our national security."
The statement added that the NATO Council would convene "shortly" to consider the matter. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a Twitter post that the request would be considered without delay.
Israel puts trust in Iron Dome
Rasmussen said the letter from Turkey requested Patriot missiles that would "contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along NATO's south-eastern border" and serve as "a concrete demonstration of alliance solidarity and resolve."
His statement said three NATO countries have available Patriot missiles -- Germany, the Netherlands and the United States -- and it would be up to them to decide if they can deploy them and for how long.
A NATO team will visit Turkey next week to survey possible deployment sites for the missiles, Rasmussen's statement said.
Sources told CNN that Germany would be the likely source for a deployment. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that any decision involving her country would need the approval of Parliament.

In Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal said NATO forces under the command of the alliance would come to Turkey as part of the missile deployment. He noted that NATO-supplied Patriot missiles previously were deployed in Turkey in 1991 and 2003.
"It's not as if they are going to come tomorrow to be deployed," Unal said, calling the move a precautionary measure that will deter escalation along the Syrian border.
International and Turkish media reported earlier this month that Turkey planned to ask NATO to station Patriot missiles along the border with Syria, but Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied it at the time.
Turkey has been careful to make clear it plans no offensive action and does not want a war with Syria, which shares a more than 500-mile border.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul told reporters November 8 that while going to war with Syria was "out of the question," precautions were needed against "ballistic missiles as well as mid-range and near-range missiles."
The U.S.-made Patriot missile system -- which became well known during the first Gulf War in the early 1990s when it protected American allies against Iraqi Scud missiles -- works well against short- and medium-range missiles.
Last month, Syrian artillery shells hit the Turkish border town of Akcakale, killing five Turkish citizens. Soon after, the Turkish Parliament approved a resolution that would allow the military to carry out cross-border incursions.
Since then, Turkish forces have retaliated swiftly with artillery after more than a dozen cross-border artillery strikes believed to have been carried out by the Syrian military.
Once-cozy relations between Syria and Turkey have all but collapsed since the Syrian uprising began last year. Turkey is officially hosting more than 111,000 Syrian refugees, but the Turkish government says tens of thousands of unofficial refugees also live in Turkish cities and towns near the Syrian border.
Meanwhile, Damascus has repeatedly accused its former ally of meddling in internal Syrian affairs by funding and arming the Syrian opposition, as well as providing sanctuary and medical care to Syrian rebels.
CNN's Susannah Palk, Gul Tuysuz, Tom Cohen, Richard Greene and Barbara Starr contributed to this report. 0

Global CEOs lack confidence in 2013 By Ramy Inocencio, for CNN
updated 1:41 AM EST, Thu January 24, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Confidence of global CEOs falls for second year in row, says auditing firm PwC
Only 36% of global CEOs feel "very confident" headed into 2013
CEOs in Western Europe, North America, Asia, Africa less confident in short-term growth
Only CEOs in Latin America saw slight rise in confidence Hong Kong (CNN) -- For the second year in a row, the confidence of global CEOs in their company's growth has fallen, according to the 16th Global CEO Survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the global auditing firm.
Only 36% of CEOs surveyed around the world feel "very confident" headed into 2013. CEO confidence has been steadily eroding the past two years; in 2011, 48% of CEOs surveyed were very confident, sliding to 40% last year.
"I was actually surprised this year. I would have said that I think things are getting better," said PwC's Chairman Dennis Nally in an interview with CNN's Richard Quest.
"I think Europe is getting better. I think the issues in the United States are getting better. We avoided the fiscal cliff. I think you saw growth rates coming out of China in the fourth quarter which are much more positive than what many had predicted so I would have been, quite frankly, more optimistic than what our survey results suggest."

Emerging markets in Davos
The PwC report, released at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, also found that just more than half -- 52% -- of CEOs surveyed thought the 2013 global economic environment would stay the same, up four points from 2012. More than one in four believe it will deteriorate; less than 20% think it will improve.
"I would sum it up by saying I think we're in a period which is a stubborn recovery," says Nally. "Many have said that this recovery should have been more fast-paced."
That sentiment is nearly ubiquitous for short-term growth around the world, according to the PwC survey, with CEOs in North America, Asia-Pacific and Africa all registering falls in confidence -- most with double-digit percentage drops. Only Latin American CEOs saw their confidence rise.
Western European CEOs were the least confident of all -- just 22% were "very confident of growth", down from 39% in 2011.
"I think Europe has done a great job over the last six months managing its way through the crisis," says PwC's Nally. (But) they're not out of it yet."

Is Hillary Clinton the next Mitt Romney?
By S.E. Cupp
updated 1:15 AM EST, Sun December 15, 2013
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured in October 2012, has become one of the most powerful people in Washington. Here's a look at her life and career through the years:
Before she married Bill Clinton, she was Hillary Rodham. Here, Rodham talks about student protests in 1969, which she supported in her commencement speech at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
Rodham, center, a lawyer for the Rodino Committee, and John Doar, left, chief counsel for the committee, bring impeachment charges against President Richard Nixon in the Judiciary Committee hearing room at the U.S. Capitol in 1974.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
S.E. Cupp: Hillary Clinton met with Goldman execs, investors, brought reassuring message
She says that's at odds with progressive stance of Warren, Obama. How will it play to left?
She says Clinton courting progressives too; may have trouble reconciling two camps
Cupp: Clinton could end up like Romney: out of touch wih 'little people,' mouthing 90s rhetoric
Editor's note: S.E. Cupp is co-host of the new "Crossfire," which airs weekdays at 6:30 p.m. ET on CNN. She is also the author of "Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity," co-author of "Why You're Wrong About the Right," a columnist at the New York Daily News and a political commentator for Glenn Beck's "The Blaze."
(CNN) -- Big banks have found few political friends in recent years. Excoriated by President Barack Obama and progressive Democrats like Elizabeth Warren for their "greedy" policies, rejected by Tea Party conservatives for being too cozy with Washington, and even seemingly scolded by Pope Francis in his Evangelii Gaudium last month, it's almost as if Wall Street has been sent to the woodshed.
And after the 2012 presidential election, it's not hard to understand why no one wants to appear too comfortable with the "plutocracy." Many have argued that Mitt Romney's Bain Capital pedigree and his comments at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of private equity manager Marc Leder about the "47%" helped tank his campaign. Fate sealed: Romney-the-plutocrat was cooked.
But perhaps the big banks have found an unlikely new ally: Hillary Clinton.
S.E. Cupp
An article in Politico Magazine this week, one that elicited little response from Democrats, recounted Clinton's recent remarks to Goldman Sachs executives and a few hundred major investors, seemingly to reassure them that she didn't think the banks were all bad.
According to the story (ironically headlined, "Lament of the Plutocrats"):
"...Clinton offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring, according to accounts offered by several attendees, declaring that the banker-bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish. Striking a soothing note on the global financial crisis, she told the audience, in effect: We all got into this mess together, and we're all going to have to work together to get out of it. What the bankers heard her to say was just what they would hope for from a prospective presidential candidate: Beating up the finance industry isn't going to improve the economy -- it needs to stop. And indeed Goldman's Tim O'Neill, who heads the bank's asset management business, introduced Clinton by saying how courageous she was for speaking at the bank. (Brave, perhaps, but also well-compensated: Clinton's minimum fee for paid remarks is $200,000)."
It's hard to imagine how this will square with Obama's renewed progressive, middle-class agenda for Democrats. According to the White House, raising the minimum wage and lessening income inequality will be major parts of Obama's 2014 domestic plan -- as well as his State of the Union address and budget.
More problematic is how Hillary Clinton's bighearted rhetoric toward Wall Street will accord with Democrats generally. You don't have to go to Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts or Bill de Blasio in Manhattan; it isn't hard to find a Democrat, be they union machinist, single mom, or Wal-Mart cashier, who wants to punish the banks and weaken their influence in politics and everything else we do.
Hardest of all to figure is how this will square with Clinton herself. Since leaving the State Department, she's made concerted (and some would argue necessary) efforts at rebranding herself as more progressive, speaking on voting rights, women's issues, and gay rights.
Hillary Clinton, Pres. Obama & 2016
Clinton talks Obamacare and Hillary 2016
Could a Hillary Clinton run harm Obama?
In a recent New Republic piece by Noam Scheiber titled "Hillary's Nightmare? A Democratic Party that Realizes its Soul Lies with Elizabeth Warren," the writer describes Clinton's hard left turn this way: "she recently used the word 'progressive' so many times in a single speech it was tempting to describe her condition as 'severe.'"
Indeed, is Clinton in danger of becoming the next Mitt Romney? Heir(ess) to the throne, the natural front-runner, but out of touch with "the little people," stuck in the rhetoric -- and passé politicking -- of the 1990s?
I talked to several Democratic strategists who were incredulous that Clinton cozied up to the bankers, and wondered how long it would take for progressive groups -- or Republicans -- to jump on it. Her bizarre tryst with Goldman and friends, and her nurturing message to them, doesn't only put her to the right of progressive superstars like Warren and DeBlasio -- and to the right of Obama, and to the right of most Democratic voters -- but also to the right of many anti-bank, populist conservatives.
That's tough -- and odd -- territory for Hillary Clinton to stake out in the run-up to a presidential election. But will Democrats hold her accountable? Or will she get a pass because she's (sigh) Hillary? Elizabeth Warren, where are you?
