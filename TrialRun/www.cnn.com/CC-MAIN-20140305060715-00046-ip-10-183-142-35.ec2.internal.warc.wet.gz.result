Tips to fight your travel credit card disputeStory Highlights Disputing a credit card charge is more of an art than a science, says expert Weaker challenges are rejected. Why is one challenge weaker than another? "This process is similar to a trial," says expert Something wonky on billing statement? Immediately file dispute with creditorNext Article in Travel » By Christopher Elliott Tribune Media Services	(Tribune Media Services) -- When Carla DeLuca canceled her room at the W Hotel Union Square in New York a week before her arrival, the hotel decided to ding her for a night's stay anyway. When unwanted fees pop up on credit card bills, they may end up being contested, if they're not removed. Despite assurances from several W employees that the erroneous charge would be reversed, DeLuca, who owns a marketing company in San Francisco, was asked to pay an extra $330 on her next American Express bill. So DeLuca did what increasing numbers of travelers are doing: she filed a dispute with her charge card company. "The hotel told American Express that it was my responsibility to pay," she recalls. But Amex sided with DeLuca, crediting her for the full amount. "The number of credit card disputes seems to be on the rise," says Jason Sarracini, the president of Toronto-based TargetVacations.ca, an online travel agency. "Consumers seem to think they can use their cards as bargaining tools." But as far as tools go, credit cards are not exactly what you'd call reliable. That's because disputing a card charge is more of an art than a science. Don't Miss In Depth: Travel Companion
For example, Ron Di Costanzo, a retired college professor, didn't want to pay his $15 luggage fee when his bags were lost after a recent United Airlines flight. "I wrote my credit card company and told it that if I was paying for a bag, it should be there when I arrive," he says. "I was credited the $15." But Angie Zimmerman, who had a similar problem with United, didn't prevail when she balked at paying her credit card bill. When she had trouble with a seat assignment on a recent United flight, she phoned the airline to fix the problem. A few weeks later, she found an extra charge for travel insurance on her credit card bill. "I never purchased flight insurance," she says. "I tried to contact United, but it's impossible to speak to anyone -- and if you can, you are speaking with people in India who don't have command of the English language. Very frustrating!" Still, her credit card company sided with United. It's no secret that in this recession, many travel companies are playing the discount-and-surcharge game. You know, the one where they slash prices and then add hidden fees to make up the difference. It would follow, then, that a lot of unwanted charges are popping up on credit card bills -- fees that, if not removed, will end up being contested. Here's what you need to know in order to file a successful dispute. 1. Watch your bill Review your credit card billing statement as soon as you get it online or through the mail. "Compare receipts to charges listed on the statement," says Catherine Williams, a vice president at Money Management International, a Chicago-based financial advice company. "Should you see any mismatch of information, like a wrong amount or an unknown vendor, you should immediately file a dispute with you creditor." Remember, while your dispute is under investigation, the amount in question can't be charged interest or reported as late in payment. 2. Have an airtight case Obviously, every disputed card charge won't be decided in your favor. The weaker challenges are rejected. For instance, say someone buys a vacation package online and then the price falls. "Many times, we are not able to refund the difference, so consumers decide to take action," says Sarracini of TargetVacations.ca. Yet those still remain legitimate purchases, and a dispute isn't likely to do any good. On the other hand, if a company has violated federal or state laws, or breached its own contract, then you stand an excellent chance of prevailing. 3. Exhaust all other options A credit card dispute shouldn't be your first move but rather a last resort, say experts. "You should go to the merchant first to try to resolve your problem," says Josh Moritz, a managing partner at Blau Moritz Klang, a marketing agency that develops credit-card debt collection programs for banks. "Oftentimes, the merchant will make amends." That might include a partial refund or credit for a future product. Consider the resolution carefully before deciding to take your case to a dispute, which is more of a winner-takes-all proposition. You might be better off compromising. 4. Know the law The Fair Credit Billing Act lets you dispute billing errors directly with your credit card company. It covers everything from fraudulent purchases to incorrect billing amounts to deficient merchandise, according to Orlando-based consumer rights attorney Don Petersen. "Credit card companies must conduct a reasonable investigation within two months and send ... a letter informing the consumer of the results of its investigation," he says. Here's more information on the rules (http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre16.shtm). Also, bear in mind that you may have other remedies, says Ken Lin, the chief executive of Credit Karma, a financial information company based in San Francisco. "There are often consumer protection laws at the state level regarding warrantees and refunds," he says. 5. Don't forget the exceptions The Fair Credit Billing Act has provisions that say the purchase price must exceed $50 and the transaction needs to occur within the same state as the cardholder's address, or within 100 miles of the cardholder's address, in order for the law to apply. But credit card companies' dispute departments do not always observe that. "In practice, these provisions aren't generally enforced," says Curtis Arnold, the co-author of "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Person-to-Person Lending." "So if you have a dispute on a transaction that's on the other side of the country, don't let this prevent you from filing." 6. Remember your paperwork Documentation is important for any credit card dispute, says Rich Bialek, a Wheaton, Illinois-based credit card expert. After contacting your card company, it will review your eligibility and examine the transaction for technical compliance. If it passes both those tests, it hands the dispute off to the travel company, which eventually triggers a dispute resolution process established by each of the card networks. "This process is similar to a trial, with the card issuer representing the consumer, the merchant's bank representing the merchant and the network acting as judge and jury," he says. In order to win, you'll need ample documentation, according to Bialek. His advice: "Keep receipts." 7. If you lose, you still have options "You can complain to the Federal Trade Commission and sue if the dispute is not resolved properly," says Sandy Shore, a senior counselor for Novadebt, a Freehold, New Jersey-based credit counseling services firm. Put differently, just because you lose a dispute doesn't mean you've lost the money. When you've won your dispute and reported the travel company to the government -- as I'm sure any reader of this column is capable of -- be sure to show your appreciation to your credit card company. A card that successfully advocates for you deserves your business and recommendation. And what if it fails? "If you're not satisfied with your current company," says Glen Lazovick, a senior vice president at Mid-Atlantic Federal Credit Union in Germantown, Maryland, "Go elsewhere."

When having an MBA is ImportantBy Beth Braccio Hering, CareerBuilder.com MBAs may not be required for some jobs, but the degree can open the door to more opportunities, say experts. STORY HIGHLIGHTSIn a tough economy, an MBA can open doors for a new job.An MBA can get you to a job faster than just having a bachelor's degree.Jobs in investment banking or corporate finance may expect an MBA.An MBA can fill in gaps in one's education. RELATED TOPICS
Jobs and Labor
(CareerBuilder.com) -- Some people view an MBA degree the same way that Charlie thought about his Golden Ticket in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory": They believe a piece of paper can magically transport you to a place you only imagined. But can this addition to your résumé really be your dream ticket? Yes. No. Maybe. There are no simple answers, but here are ways that an MBA might help you. MBA could get you hired in a tough economy Let's face it: If you had your pick between two candidates -- one with a BBA and one with an MBA -- who were both qualified for a job, wouldn't you take the one with the higher degree? Because of the recession's affect on employment, many companies have a wealth of talent to pick from at the moment and some can afford to be choosy in their hiring. Candidates need to score every point possible, and a graduate degree may give that extra edge. Read students trying to get a job in the tough economy "A category of jobs that begins to show up more in a recession is one that says MBA desired or preferred versus MBA required," says Dennis Grindle, director of the SMU Cox School of Business MBA Career Management Center in Dallas, Tex. "These jobs tend to pay somewhere in between a BBA and an MBA. This allows an MBA to get into what they want to do by taking a step back to hopefully go forward later when economic times get better." MBA may get you where you want to go faster Video: Marketing, sales jobs hot right now
"Having an MBA -- as opposed to just a bachelor's degree in business -- is sort of like traveling someplace by plane instead of taking the train. With either business degree, you may eventually wind up at your final 'destination' -- but the MBA will get you there faster," says Elizabeth Freedman, author of "The MBA Student's Job-Seeking Bible" and "Work 101: Learning the Ropes of the Workplace Without Hanging Yourself." Read top job hot spots for the next decade Some of the opportunities an MBA degree may jump-start include: • Managing larger teams • Running meetings • Greater interaction with clients • More decision-making power • Representing the company at events • "Choicer" projects • Responsibility for your own set of clients/projects MBA is sometimes expected "In certain organizations (top-tier consulting firms, for instance), having an MBA or an advanced degree is practically a requirement for certain positions," Freedman notes. "It's hard to move up without that credential, no matter how talented." In this situation, the degree basically becomes a minimum qualification -- not your ace in the hole. To land the position, you are then expected to bring what Grindle calls "an A+ game" to the table, meaning that you have everything the employer is looking for and then some. Grindle notes that whether a function requires an MBA or not may vary by company size, industry, state of the economy, and even geographical location. Still, there are fields that commonly utilize MBAs, including: • Consumer Brand Marketing • Corporation Finance • Venture Capital • Investment Banking • Commercial Banking • Production/Operations Management • New Product Development • Management Consulting • Private Equity • Strategic Planning/Business Development MBA can round out an education Some workers hold undergraduate degrees in fields other than business. By seeking an MBA, these employees can fill in possible gaps in their education as well as show their commitment to their field. Likewise, a person who already holds an undergraduate business degree but perhaps has been working in a different area can update his skills by seeking a graduate degree. The decision whether or not to pursue an MBA is a tough one. It involves serious thought about money, time and career goals. But for those who decide that getting an MBA is the path they wish to take, the degree might open up a whole new world of possibilities.© CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

Obsessions: Gwyneth Paltrow is having a moment By Lisa Respers France, CNN Gwyneth Paltrow is riding high these days as one of the coolest actresses in Hollywood. STORY HIGHLIGHTSGwyneth Paltrow used to be viewed as less than coolShe's been mocked for her online newsletter, GOOPAppearances on "Glee" and awards show have helped transform her image

Celebrity News
Glee (TV Show)
Television
The countdown to Hollywood's biggest night is on. Join "Showbiz Tonight's" A.J. Hammer and Brooke Anderson for live red carpet access at the Oscars on "Road to Gold" this Sunday at 7 p.m. ET on CNN. (CNN) -- Remember when Gwyneth Paltrow was viewed as icy, erudite and just a touch untouchable? After all, the actress is in a league of her own. She speaks fluent Spanish, advocates a macrobiotic diet and urges followers of her site GOOP to buy high-end products for everyday living that most people can only dream about. She is the woman who once held the hearts of both Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck in her manicured, patrician hands, had the temerity to name her daughter "Apple," and has managed to have a more private personal life than just about anyone else married to a British rock star. So why is she now so cool? In Hollywood, as in life, it's all about the timing. This has been quite a year for Paltrow, who on Sunday is set to perform an Oscar-nominated tune from her recent film "Country Strong" on the Academy Awards. For those keeping track, it will be the completion of her trifecta of performances after hitting the stages of the Country Music Awards and the Grammys. The latter saw her clad in a black body suit and high heels, climbing aboard a baby grand piano to rock out "Forget You" with singer Cee Lo and a group of musical puppets. The moment led hip-pop website Global Grind to proclaim, "It's official and definitely cemented that Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty damn cool." To illustrate how far the actress has come in the street cred department, one need only look to articles like the one published last year by Salon.com titled "Why Do So Many People Hate Gwyneth Paltrow?" In it, writer Mary Elizabeth Williams noted that Paltrow hate is "nothing new" and "like herpes, it can lie dormant for long periods of time, but it never goes away completely." "Taller, blonder, richer than thou, she has, since she launched her career 15 years ago, represented the epitome of everything most mere mortals will never come close to being, a Little Miss Perfect who had sex with Brad Pitt," Williams wrote. Much of the mocking of Paltrow has revolved around her site GOOP, where she offers her advice on what to make, go, get, do, be and see. In 2009, Daily Beast writer Rebecca Dana chronicled her three-week adventure of attempting to follow Paltrow's words of wisdom, which range from detoxing with expensive organic juices to getting into the holiday spirit by purchasing a $1,395 Mulberry weekend bag in chocolate natural leather. "There's a lot to scoff at here, but the three weeks I spent following GOOP were pure joy," Dana wrote. "Expensive, inconvenient and totally unsustainable, yes, but also full of unexpected pleasures." Paltrow addressed the barbs aimed at her and Goop in an interview last year with Harper's Bazaar. "The hotel concierge is not telling me where to get a facial, Christy Turlington is," Paltrow said. "Doesn't everyone want to know that? I would want to know if you went to Mario Batali's house what he made you for dinner and could I have the recipe. So why not?" Fans doubted just a bit when it was announced that the actress would be making a guest appearance on the hit Fox show "Glee." Even Entertainment Weekly mused that "seeing the world's poshest human sing about not being able to afford a Ferrari will provide some interesting cultural dissonance." Sure, Paltrow is married to Coldplay front man Chris Martin, is besties with Beyonce and has showcased her singing in movie roles. Could she pull off a small screen appearance on a show enjoying its zeitgeist moment in the sun? Those sentiments were echoed in Paltrow's opening scene when one of the characters asks Paltrow's character, "What would you know about Cee Lo, cause you're like 40?" (In reality the actress is 38.) Paltrow's performance nailed it and charmed the socks off gleeks and critics alike. "She not only acknowledges the fact that she's exceedingly white, she owns it," said Jen Chancy of the Washington Post's Celebritology 2.0 column. "Her vocals are strong and she completely embraces the cornball-tasticness in a way that not every 'Glee' guest star -- or for that matter, cast member -- can always manage." The gig went over so well that Paltrow was invited back for another appearance as everyone's favorite substitute teacher, Holly Holiday (Even the name is cool!). While she revels in her newfound uber-hipness, the actress, who won an Academy Award when she was 26 for her role in "Shakespeare in Love," and her family continue to split their time between England and the States as she plans her next roles and Martin pursues his music. Paltrow told talk show host Chelsea Handler that her kids are growing up experiencing both cultures to the fullest -- and consequently have adopted interesting accents. "My (son's accent) is like half Brooklyn, half English," Paltrow said. "My daughter is completely American at home with me and completely British at school. If she's home with a friend over she'll be like (in a British accent) 'Mummy, I really can't find the Play Doh.' Then she will come over to me and she'll be like (in an American accent) 'That Play Doh's totally dried out.' " That's pretty damn cool.

FDA investigates deaths preliminarily linked to energy shots
By William Hudson, CNN
updated 7:11 AM EST, Fri November 16, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
FDA: 3 deaths have been preliminarily linked to 5-hour ENERGY supplement
No cause-and-effect relationship has been established, according to the FDA
The company is not required to disclose the amount of caffeine in its "energy shot"
(CNN) -- Thirteen deaths have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration as "adverse events" after the consumption of the dietary supplement 5-hour ENERGY, according to an FDA statement. While anyone can report an adverse event, and although no cause-and-effect relationship has been established, the FDA said it is investigating, as is required by law. A report does not mean a product is responsible for or that it contributed to any health issue.
"If we find a relationship between consumption of the product and harm, FDA will take appropriate action to reduce or eliminate the risk," the FDA said. "While the FDA investigates all reports to the best of its ability, it does not always have access to all the information needed to conclusively determine the cause of the event."
As a dietary supplement, 5-hour ENERGY is not required to disclose the amount of caffeine in its 2-ounce "energy shot." Instead, the 5-hour ENERGY label lists 1,870 milligrams of an "Energy Blend," which includes caffeine, taurine and other ingredients.
A ConsumerLab.com analysis found about 207 milligrams of caffeine in one 5-hour ENERGY. Red Bull, by comparison, contains about 80 milligrams of caffeine in an 8.4-ounce can, while a 16-ounce grande Starbucks Pike Place brewed coffee contains about 330 milligrams of caffeine.
The distributor of 5-hour ENERGY, Living Essentials LLC, said in a statement: "We recommend on product labels and the 5-hour ENERGY website that individuals consume no more than two bottles of 5-hour ENERGY shots per day, spaced several hours apart. Consumers who have caffeine sensitivities should consult with a physician before taking and can consider the 'decaf' version."
Last month, the parents of Anais Fournier, 14, filed a lawsuit alleging that she died after drinking two Monster Energy drinks in a 24-hour period. In her case, an underlying heart condition was complicated by caffeine toxicity, according to the death certificate.
Whether the 13 deaths preliminarily linked to 5-Hour ENERGY were similarly complicated by other medical conditions is under investigation.
In addition to the deaths, there have been a total of 92 patient reports, including 33 hospitalizations, reported as 5-Hour ENERGY adverse events, according to the FDA.

Serena survives scare to make Miami quarters
updated 6:54 PM EDT, Mon March 25, 2013
Serena Williams, who lives in nearby Palm Beach, dug deep to see off Dominika Cibulkova at Key Biscayne. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Serena Williams rallies from 2-6, 1-4 down to beat Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia
World No. 1 to face Li Na of China in quarterfinals
Andy Murray also through after Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov crumbles against Scot
(CNN) -- Serena Williams stayed on course to become the first woman to win the Miami Masters six times but only just, after surviving a major scare against Dominika Cibulkova.
At one point, the 13th seed from Slovakia led 6-2, 4-1 and seemed to have one foot in the quarterfinals until Williams, 31, displayed the fighting qualities that have made her one of the greats of the game.
The world No. 1 rallied to win 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 and so book her place in the last eight, where she will take on China's Li Na, the fifth seed.
"I just thought to myself, 'Well, I've been down worse. It's nothing new. Just keep fighting'," Williams -- whose five crowns are equaled only by Steffi Graf -- told reporters in Key Biscayne.
"I never give up. It doesn't matter whether it's in life or on the tennis court -- I keep fighting."

Tommy Haas: My daughter motivates me
"I was playing a really good opponent who plays really well. She's a good fighter and a great player," added the American, who is seeking her first Miami title to add to those won in 2002-2004 and 2007-2008.
Unfortunately for Cibulkova however, the defeat marked the second year in a row where the 23-year-old has led the world's best by a significant distance in Miami only to fail to make it over the finish line.
In 2012, the right-hander led Victoria Azarenka 6-1, 5-2 before succumbing to defeat.

Meanwhile, Na was unconvincing as she made 39 unforced errors in a straight sets defeat of Spanish teenager Garbine Muguruza (7-6, 6-2).
Playing her first tournament since injuring her ankle at January's Australian Open, Na let both a 5-1 lead in the first set -- and then a 6-1 lead in the tie break -- slip before dismissing the 19-year-old who had knocked out Caroline Wozniacki and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.
Defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska also had trouble making it through as the fourth seed recovered from losing the first set before seeing off the challenge of rising talent Sloane Stephens with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-0 win.

Next up for the Pole is Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens, who saw off Croatia's Ajla Tomljanovic 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 to continue her best start to a season -- as she reached her fourth quarterfinal of the year.
In the men's section, second seed Andy Murray saw off the challenge of Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets (7-6, 6-3) after the Bulgarian also let a decent lead slip.
The 21-year-old had the chance to win the first set when serving at 5-3 but three double faults handed the Scot a lifeline.
It is the second time in as many tournaments that Dimitrov has cracked when serving for a set against a top-ranked player, having served four double faults when leading world No. 1 Novak Djokovic 5-3 at Indian Wells earlier this month.
Murray will face Italy's Andrea Seppi in the quarterfinals.

High-school teen builds one-man submarine for $2,000
By Arion McNicoll for CNN
updated 8:53 AM EDT, Wed May 29, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
New Jersey teenager Justin Beckerman has constructed a working one-man submarine out of spare parts and discarded objects.
The entire project took six months and cost just $2,000. Beckerman designed and built the entire submarine himself.
The submarine is rigged with fuses, back-up batteries, a radio, siren, strobe lights, breathing apparatus and a pump system for if the vessel begins taking on water.
The submarine, christened the Nautilus in a nod to Jules Verne, can dive to a depth of 30 feet, though so far Justin's father, Ken, has only let him go as deep as six.
Beckerman says he hopes to use the submarine to 'explore the lake, see fish and hopefully find a bit of history "like the cannons from my neighbors' historic house" he says.
The hatch of the submarine is made from a skylight, its body is made of drainage pipes, and the pressure gauges are made from an old restaurant soda fountain that Beckerman found behind a shopping center.
Beckerman says that he doesn't really have a favorite inventor. Though he did do a paper on Steve Jobs once.
He adds that the entire project was a challenge, but the most difficult part was figuring out how to balance the ballast tanks.
The New Jersey teen says he would like to attach a robotic claw to the front so he can clean the bottom of the lake. After he graduates high school Beckerman says he hopes to pursue his passion for engineering.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mendham High School student Justin Beckerman builds one-man submarine
The Submarine can dive to 30 feet and travels at one and a half miles per hour
Inventive teen has also built airplanes, boats, robots, and architectural constructions
(CNN) -- The submarine's body may be constructed from drainage pipes and the hatch from a recycled skylight, but according to its 18-year-old inventor, this single-person U-boat can plunge to a depth of 30 feet and has already completed three successful dives.
The Nautilus took high school inventor Justin Beckerman just six months and $2,000 to put together -- all while keeping on top of his homework.
"He has been building things since he was two years old," says his mother, Jess Beckerman. "If we tried to help him we would just get in the way and mess things up."
The submarine has ballast tanks to maintain its depth and equilibrium; air vents that bring oxygen down from the surface; a functioning PA and a range of emergency systems including back-up batteries, a siren, strobe lights, a breathing apparatus and a pump to fight leaks. The vessel can remain submerged for up to two hours and travels beneath the waves at one and a half miles per hour.
Beckerman says he is going to use it to "explore the lake, see fish and hopefully find a bit of history, like the cannons from my neighbors' historic house" that, he says, were dumped in the lake during renovations in the 1960s.

How Post-it notes spread like a virus
When he was younger, Beckerman began by making things out of balloons and string, but as the years went by his inventions grew in scale and complexity. At the age of 12, instead of complaining about having to help with the housework, he developed a remote-controlled car that could mop and vacuum.
Beckerman's website is a testament to his enormous productivity. It is a menagerie of home-constructed machines including boats, planes, architectural constructions, and prize-winning robots.

The materials he uses in his creations are often technological cast-offs from family and friends, or garbage scavenged from electronics recycling facilities. The Nautilus has regulators and pressure gauges from an old restaurant soda fountain that Beckerman found behind a shopping center. The two main batteries are from a child's ride-on toy, and its PA speakers are made from an old car stereo.
Beckerman says he decided to build the submarine because "I wanted to see if I could do it. It combined so many different aspects of things that I had worked on in the past." The Nautilus has the most ambitious wiring system Beckerman has installed since he constructed his tree fort -- a veritable forest castle that puts all other tree forts to shame.
Armed with more modern conveniences than many proper homes, the fort has a TV, wall-mounted speakers, desktop computer, air conditioning, shelving, and fluorescent lights. "It has everything a house should have," says Beckerman, "except a refrigerator and a bathroom."
The Nautilus is not Beckerman's first submarine. In fact, it is his fourth. The previous iteration could dive to five feet, but had a less sturdy frame constructed from plastic containers and duct tape. It was propelled by two motor scooter engines, connected to metal blades and two 12v batteries.
I wanted to see if I could do it ...Justin Beckerman, teenaged inventor
The new design improves on previous models in almost every way.
"I had an idea of how I wanted to sit. I realized that lying down would make the sub more streamlined -- so the drainage pipes seemed a natural fit," he said. But sacrifices to the original design had to be made along the way.
"The ballast tanks were originally going to be air tanks, but they were just too expensive. If I could have learned how to weld I would have made the whole thing out of metal. But that might be for the next one."

Asked if there are any particular challenges which are specific to being a young inventor, Beckerman responds plainly: "No. Other than the budget issues and all of my schoolwork and other obligations that get in the way."
If he had more time and money Beckerman says he would like to continue to add to the submarine. "I would love to add a robotic claw to the front. I would like to make the sub into a more useful thing with a basket the claw could put stuff into to pick up garbage and clean the bottom of the lake."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Johnson played the iconic role of Professor Roy Hinkley on "Gilligan's Island"
Johnson worked up until his death, signing autographs over holidays
He was "just a positive and nice guy," his agent says
Johnson, 89, was an Army Air Forces veteran of World War II
(CNN) -- Actor Russell Johnson, best known as Professor in the 1960s TV sitcom "Gilligan's Island," died Thursday, his agent said. Johnson was 89.
Johnson played the iconic role of Professor Roy Hinkley, whose scientific schemes to get the castaways rescued were always foiled by Gilligan's bumbling.
He died at his home in Washington, where he lived with his wife, Connie. She and their daughter, Kimberly, were at his side, said agent Mike Eisenstadt. Johnson is also survived by a stepson, Court, and a grandson, he said.
Johnson worked up until his death, signing autographs over the holidays, said Eisenstadt. He called Johnson's death "unexpected."
The chief deputy coroner in Kitsap County, Washington, told CNN that Johnson died from natural causes.
Johnson was "just a positive and nice guy" who always treated people with respect, his agent said.
His acting career began in the early 1950s with many jobs as a character actor on television. He played Marshal Gib Scott in two seasons of "Black Saddle," a Western that ran in 1959 and 1960.
Johnson acted in dozens of television shows after the four seasons on "Gilligan's Island," but his career seemed stranded on its own island because of the popular sitcom role.
A noteworthy big screen role was as a nuclear physicist in the 1955 science fiction film "This Island Earth."

Johnson was in Ray Bradbury's 1953 sci-fi classic "It Came From Outer Space."
Before becoming an actor, Johnson served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. He was on a B-24 Liberator when it was shot down during a bombing raid over the Philippines in 1945, according to his official biography, and used his G.I. Bill benefits to pay for acting school after the war.
Johnson, in a 2004 interview for the Archive of American Television said the success of "Gilligan's Island, which he never expected to last more than the initial order of 13 episodes, was the result of the "great chemistry" of the cast.
Tina Louise, who played the glamorous Hollywood starlet Ginger on "Gilligan's Island said she was " very saddened to hear of the passing of Russell Johnson."
"My prayers and condolences go out to his wife Constance and his family," Louise said. "He will always be in our hearts and remembered from Gilligan's island as part of American pop culture history. He will truly be missed."
Advice to young actors
Johnson's advice to young actors was to "prepare yourself."
"Most of us have to really learn how to do what we do, and that takes some studying and being part of an acting group," he said. "Preparation is everything, and that means studying."
Another important ingredient to acting success is perseverance, he said. "You can have all the talent in the world, but if you don't persevere, if you don't stick to it, it doesn't mean anything."

Possibly the world's most impressive paper plane
By Simon Busch, CNN
updated 4:52 AM EST, Tue February 4, 2014
Luca Iaconi-Stewart has spent the past five years -- around 10,000 man hours -- making a minutely detailed, 1:60 scale replica of an Air India Boeing 777 out of manila folders.
Iaconi-Stewart, 22, from San Francisco, is an aviation fan. He also modeled a jet liner out of admiration for its gorgeous profile. He expects to finish the plane this summer: only the wings to go.
Iaconi-Stewart's "mini-me," as he puts it, poses next to one of the Boeing's intricately carved engines. The model maker had to copy many of his design drawings from pictures of the Boeing -- until he came across a plane maintenance manual.
The result is accurate even down to the tread on the undercarriage tires.
The entire construction is made out of cardboard.
The beautiful, undulating shape of the engine fan blades is a particular delight. Iaconi-Stewart reckons around 400 manila folders have gone into the plane so far.
The young aviation fan went to great pains to model the different classes of seats correctly. Economy class seats took around 20 minutes each ...
... but there were a lot of them.
Business class seats each extracted up to six hours of Iaconi-Stewart's labor.
An average of eight hours of cutting, folding, fiddling and gluing per "suite." No wonder first class is pricy.
The plane is complete with logos and livery.
An irradiated food smell would add that extra touch of authenticity.
Iaconi-Stewart's next life project? "Something more normal."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
22-year-old aviation junkie makes minutely detailed miniature replica of Boeing 777
10,000 hours and 400 manila folders later, there are only the wings to go
"Beauty" of jet liner's form attracted Iaconi-Stewart to the project
(CNN) -- All that's missing are the fussy flight attendants and the smell of irradiated food.
Oh, and maybe some nerve-jangling turbulence.
And reassuring pilots.
Twenty-two-year-old San Franciscan Luca Iaconi-Stewart has done what any self-respecting airplane fanatic would do.
800-pound paper airplane takes flight
He's got his own.
Unlike, say, John Travolta, however, who owns and flies five planes including a Boeing 707-138, Iaconi-Stewart's craft is more befitting his age and status.
It's four feet long.
And made of cardboard.
And he built it himself.
Plane crazy?
Meet the model-maker: Luca Iaconi-Stewart.
A plane made out of cardboard? Sounds like something that might end up, sadly askew, in the corner of the room the morning after a bored frat boys' night before.
Not this 1:60 scale, painstakingly detailed replica of an Air India Boeing 777 made entirely out of manila folders -- and a little glue -- and currently parked in a mini-hangar somewhere whose location Iaconi-Stewart understandably declines to disclose.
In case it gets hijacked, or whatever the paper-plane equivalent is, and the 10,000 hours he estimates he's devoted to the project over the past five-and-a-half years, off and on, go to waste.
Not to mention squandering enough manila folders -- he reckons around 400 -- to give your average stationery manager apoplexy.
It's hard to believe when you look at the fantastically precise rendering of the twinjet craft -- from the undercarriage tire tread, through the gorgeous undulation of the engine-fan blades and the class-conscious carving of economy, business and first class seats to the chunky font of the airplane livery -- but Iaconi-Stewart is entirely untrained as a model maker, aside from the odd architecture class at school.
Mundane material
It's equally incredible that his Lilliputian creation is made from something as mundane as manila folders.
But that's what he liked about them -- that they're "a really unassuming material [and] readily available," Iaconi-Stewart tells CNN.
Formally untrained he might be, but one qualification he surely does possess is an unusual temerity and focus.
Each economy class seat, for instance, took 20 minutes of cutting, folding, fiddling and gluing -- and those of us who fly economy know there are a lot of seats.
The fold-out wombs of business class devoured up to six hours of Iaconi-Stewart's labor each.
First class "suites" -- hey, there's a reason people shell out for them -- took eight hours a go: an average working day.
Plane fan: Some parts look like sculpture.
Drawing from scratch
Progress on the plane was especially "tricky" in the beginning, Iaconi-Stewart says, because "there were no publicly available [assembly] drawings.
"I spent a lot of time making drawings from pictures.
"Then I got hold of a maintenance manual for people who maintain airplanes.
"It contains plenty of detail, which is useful for specific parts, but you're still having to draw everything from scratch.
"It consumes a lot of time," he says a little wistfully, some of which, you hope, he's also devoting to dating and perhaps even enjoying his new-found freedom to buy a beer.
Winging it
Iaconi-Stewart's only got the wings to go now -- they'll make the plane 3.5 feet across from tip to tip.
He's hoping to be done by the summer but, given that the engines took almost half a year from planning to completion, this last stage probably won't be a doddle.
Then -- obvious question -- will it fly?
No -- idiot! -- "it's a static model.
"In theory, it could fly if I designed it properly but it'd have to be a lot lighter and with more moving parts."
Economical: Cattle-class took 20 minutes a seat.
Terrorist evil genius?
Another obvious question these days: has he been tackled to the sidewalk by an FBI agent as a suspected evil genius terrorist in training?
"No -- although I do get asked that a lot."
And what next?
A helicopter made out of blancmange?
Well, turns out it wasn't just aviation enthusiasm that made Iaconi-Stewart shrink a plane.
It was "aesthetic choice," he says.
Nice proportions
They may sometimes be hell to ride in but we forget that a jetliner is a beautiful, streamlined thing.
"They have nice proportions," the model maker says.
"Choosing a plane was a visual decision for me.
"An impulse."
But it's "not something I would dive back into. Not that I don't enjoy it but it can be isolating at times and frustrating.
"I want to do something more normal."

Officials warn of 'electronic sanctuary' for criminals
July 14, 1999
Web posted at: 9:21 PM EDT (0121 GMT)
From CNN's Terry Frieden
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Spies will go uncaptured, drug kingpins will remain free, and terrorists will kill innocent victims if Congress fails to stop a popular legislative proposal to drop export restrictions on data-scrambling computer technology, four top government officials warned Wednesday.
Outgoing Drug Enforcement Administrator Thomas Constantine, offering the most dire predictions, said lawmakers would create "an electronic sanctuary" for criminals intent on disrupting public safety or national security if the plan to drop controls on exports of encryption technology is not stopped. He said use of the equipment, which scrambles plain text into unbreakable code, is skyrocketing among organized crime groups.
Constantine said that the wealthy, sophisticated cartels he tracks are increasingly able to outfox law enforcement by encoding the orders sent from Colombia and Mexico to lieutenants in the U.S.
The House Intelligence Committee members who heard the dire warnings expressed alarm at the potential consequences. Republicans and Democrats alike urged President Clinton to immediately focus public attention on the looming dangers.
Rep. Joe LaHood, R-Illinois announced he will immediately remove himself from a long list of 254 House co-sponsors who back what is named the "Security and Freedom Through Encryption Act."
"I would call it the Drug Lord Protection Act," Constantine fumed.
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hambre was equally blunt.
"It protects spies," Hambre declared. In passionate testimony, he charged Congress was "pandering to cyber-libertarians" and succumbing to a "romantic view" of the high-tech industry, which has lobbied intensely for passage of the measure.
Hambre said the legislation purportedly aimed at protecting citizen privacy from possible government abuse could prevent intelligence officials from discovering spies and moles in their midst.
"You can't then impose privacy concerns only on the government," he said.
Hambre asserted the great threat to citizen privacy in the computer age is not from government, but from criminals and certain highly-invasive private sector businesses.
FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno repeated similar warnings in their second trip to Capitol Hill in two days to slow support for the measure.
"We can predict, without being too dramatic about it, lives will be lost," Freeh said.
Members of both parties urged President Clinton to follow the lead of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who called industry leaders, Scotland Yard, and intelligence agencies together to hammer out a compromise that balances privacy concerns, and commercial needs and public safety and national security issues.
"Sixteen Hundred Pennsylvania Avenue should follow the example of Ten Downing Street, and focus national attention on this," said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-New York.
Supporters of the measure say the technology is already becoming available from overseas manufacturers. They say if the government doesn't drop controls, U.S. computer makers will suffer a competitive disadvantage.
Co-sponsors of the legislation include Republican leaders Richard Armey and Tom DeLay, and Democratic leaders Richard Gephardt and David Bonior.
The encryption debate is in its fifth year of congressional hearings, but passage of a decontrol measure did not gain momentum until the current session.
In the Senate, meanwhile, an encryption decontrol measure has been approved by the Commerce Committee.
