GOP cheers Obama's historic stride, but doubts his experienceStory Highlights NEW: GOPers say Clinton speech big on rhetoric, lacking hard facts from campaign NEW: Strategist compares Obama to cotton candy: "Melts on contact" Rudy Giuliani uses Clintons' own words to cast doubt on Obama's qualifications GOP has set up a war room down the street from the convention hall Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- Republicans briefly stopped attacking Sen. Barack Obama for what they call his lack of foreign policy experience to note the historic significance of the United States nominating the first African-American for president. Ex-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, with other Republicans, says Obama is not qualified to be president. "It's a tremendous night for America," said Ed Rollins, a Republican campaign consultant who has worked on high-profile political campaigns including Gov. Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential bid. "We're in a real close, real tight race. And this guy has a real shot at winning. At the end of the day, this is an extraordinary candidate," he said. "We can all share in how far we've come," said CNN conservative political analyst Amy Holmes, who is African-American. But the warm fuzzies from the GOP ended after former President Bill Clinton took the stage Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Clinton declared Obama "ready to be president of the United States." To wild applause, Clinton reminded his audience that when he ran for president in 1992, critics said he was too young and inexperienced to lead the nation. "It didn't work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because Barack Obama is on the right side of history," Clinton told the cheering crowd. Watch Clinton's entire speech » Clinton's comments raised typical reactions from Republicans, who say voters are facing the choice between a candidate with decades of experience in government and another with just a few years of service. Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut said the circumstances of past campaigns were irrelevant and accused Clinton of wrongly taking credit for the economic prosperity that marked his presidency. "Bill Clinton ran against George Bush Sr. Barack Obama is running against John McCain and that's a big difference," Shay said. "In my view, a new Republican majority in 1994 saved the Clinton presidency," he said. "We balanced the federal budget. We were the ones that cut spending." Ralph Reed, a former senior adviser to George W. Bush's campaigns in 2000 and 2004, said Clinton's speech was big on rhetoric, but failed to hammer down key issues for the American people. "I found it ironic that Bill Clinton, who vetoed $500 child tax credit and vetoed welfare reform, our most successful reform, twice before signing it, is criticizing John McCain, who is proposing taking child tax credit and doubling it," Reed told CNN's Larry King. "Bill Clinton is one of the supreme political talents, but he's both a blessing and a burden," said Reed, noting Clinton's speeches at the past two Democratic conventions. The Republicans pounced on Clinton's about-face on Obama's experience. "After three full days of the Democratic National Convention, President Clinton was finally forced to testify that Sen. Obama is ready to be president, despite his previous arguments to the contrary," said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Republican candidate John McCain. Republicans also dismissed a speech from vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden, who criticized McCain's support of offshore drilling. "Joe Biden's argument was more of the same," said radio host Lars Larson, echoing Biden's refrain that a McCain presidency would be "more of the same" from the Bush administration. "It was a tired speech." Watch Biden's entire speech » Ultimately, the Republicans agreed that the election's outcome hinged on the candidates' policies and not charisma on display by Clinton or Obama, who surprised the crowd by appearing at the end of Wednesday's convention. "It played exactly into the critique that the McCain camp has set up, that Barack Obama is this celebrity. He makes this celebrity entrance at the end night and offers no substance," GOP strategist Kevin Madden told CNN's Larry King. "It's a lot of talk, a lot of rhetoric but it's like cotton candy -- it melts on contact but you can't live on it," he said. Earlier Wednesday, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who ran for president as a Republican, used the Clintons' own words to cast doubt on Obama's qualifications. Giuliani evoked the infamous "3 a.m." moment during the primary season, when Hillary Clinton ran an ad asking voters who they wanted to respond to notification of a crisis at an unexpected moment. Former U.S. treasurer Rosario Marin criticized Obama for not mentioning the name of any Latin American countries when Obama addressed a crowd in Berlin, Germany, this summer. "I was not just disappointed, but rather, I was insulted," Marin said. The Republican Party set up a war room down the street from the convention, staffed by volunteers busily chatting on their phones and hammering away on laptops opposing much of what the Democrats say. Standing next to two big dry-erase boards and television monitors, a young McCain supporter instructed a table of volunteers in their latest spin about "solving problems." "The fact is," Matt McDonald said, "Obama has no record whatsoever doing that, and John McCain has a long record of doing that, so that should be at the core of the response."

California auditor: 1,000 state-licensed facilities match sex offenders' addresses
By Michael Martinez, CNN
updated 8:58 PM EDT, Thu October 27, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: More than 600 of the 1,000 sex offender address matches are state-licensed facilities for kids
In response, state welfare officials take legal action against eight facilities
They also bar 36 sex offenders from associating with foster homes, auditor says
Los Angeles (CNN) -- The California state auditor has found that more than 1,000 state-licensed facilities -- including more than 600 for kids -- matched addresses in the sex-offender registry, saying oversight mechanisms lag behind state requirements.
The state Department of Social Services "cites the lack of resources as the primary reason why it has not implemented an automated sex offender address match and why its oversight mechanisms are falling short of requirements," said the state auditor's report, released Thursday.
Specifically, the report said that 677 foster and group homes and other state-licensed facilities for children matched sex offenders' addresses, as well as 385 state-licensed facilities for vulnerable adults.
The auditor found that almost 600 of the 1,000 address matches were "high risk and in need of immediate investigation," the report said. It was not clear from the report how many foster and group homes are in California, in total.
This month, the state social services agency and county child welfare agencies investigated 99% of the matches and began legal actions against eight licensees of facilities, including four license revocations, said the report, titled "Child Welfare Services -- California Can and Must Provide Better Protection and Support for Abused and Neglected Children."
In six of those actions, registered sex offenders were living or present in the child facilities, and counties found 36 sex offenders having "some association" with foster homes -- prompting authorities to remove children from the facilities and ordering the offenders out of the homes, the report said.
State costs for housing foster children have also grown dramatically, California State Auditor Elaine M. Howle found.
"The percentage of children placed with private foster family agencies — agencies that recruit and certify foster homes and are compensated at a higher rate than state- or county-licensed foster homes — has dramatically increased over the last 10 years and resulted in an additional $327 million in foster care payments during that time," the report said. "The counties we visited admit to placing children with these agencies out of convenience rather than for elevated treatment needs as originally intended."
The state social services agency "generally agreed" with the auditor's findings and outlined an action plan in response to several recommendations, the auditor said.
In an October 7 response to the report, director Will Lightbourne of the California Department of Social Services wrote he agreed that "address comparison provides an additional protection for vulnerable clients in care, and agrees that prevention should be part of the protection."
"We are concerned, however, that performing matches against every known sex offender address may not be the most effective means of prevention and ensuring protection. The process involved in this audit required CDSS and counties to investigate every known address of sex offenders, including addresses that were years and in some cases, decades, out of date," Lightbourne said.
"The California Sex and Arson Registry (CSAR) includes effective dates of address and identifies active and inactive addresses, and future processes to compare addresses therefore should focus on information technology solutions to minimize the need for staff to manually search through and verify information," the director continued. "The CDSS is exploring solutions that leverage technology and key partners to create an efficient and effective process to provide this additional protection."
The state auditor also recommended that the social service agency "complete comprehensive reviews of agencies' licensing activities more timely as well as on-site reviews of state-licensed foster homes, foster family agencies, and group homes. Moreover, Social Services should ensure that rates paid to private foster family agencies are appropriate and should monitor placements with these agencies," the auditor said.
In 2010, child welfare agencies in California's 58 counties received 480,000 allegations of child abuse or neglect. Each county maintains its own child welfare service program, and the state Department of Social Services provides oversight, the report said.

Giants edge Patriots in thriller; it was Madonna dance party at half
By Phil Gast, CNN
updated 11:16 PM EST, Sun February 5, 2012
The New York Giants celebrate their 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Quarterback Eli Manning named game MVP in 21-17 thriller
Ticker-tape parade planned Tuesday in New York
Madonna dresses as Roman soldier, cheerleader
Game hosted by Indianapolis, which featured popular zip line
(CNN) -- Triumphing in a thriller, quarterback Eli Manning led the New York Giants on Sunday to their second Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in four years.
Clutching the championship trophy, Manning, the MVP award winner, said "I just stayed positive" during the seesaw struggle in Indianapolis. The Giants prevailed 21-17.
New York City wasted no time in celebrating the Super Bowl XLVI victory.
The Empire State Building was bathed in Giants blue late Sunday. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a ticker-tape parade and ceremony for Tuesday.
Assisted by crucial late receptions by Mario Manningham, Manning marched the Giants down the field in the closing minutes of the game. The go-ahead touchdown was scored by running back Ahmad Bradshaw from 6 yards out with 52 seconds remaining.
But the Patriots and Tom Brady, who was vying for his fourth championship ring, weren't quite done. They moved the ball, but had only enough time for a "Hail Mary" pass that bounced away in the Giants end zone.
After trailing the Patriots 17-9 early in the third quarter, the Giants put up the last 12 points of the game.
The Super Bowl victory was the fourth for the Giants, which defeated the Pats 17-14 in the 2008 title game.
An estimated 111 million U.S. viewers were expected to tune in, with many as interested in the ads or halftime show as much or more than the game.
Halftime entertainer Madonna had an eclectic set, joined by Cee Lo Green, Nicki Minaj and MIA.
Madonna morphed from a Roman Empire theme to a high school cheerleader, complete with pom poms and a marching band. She sang "Vogue", "Music," "Like a Prayer" and "Give Me All Your Luvin."
The Material Girl's performance ended with a bright flash of flight, and white smoke -- with her not to be seen.
The American president who saved football
A bevy of celebrities, including Jerry Seinfeld, Clint Eastwood and Elton John, showed up in commercials this year.
David Beckham provided eye candy in an H&M ad, which tended to spend more time on his chiseled and tattooed looks than the briefs he was wearing.
"No commercial this Superbowl will top #BeckhamforHM Yummy & in love!!," said one Twitter feed on an HLN TV blog.
Another commercial featured a slimmed-down dog chasing after a Volkswagen Beetle.
Pop singer Kelly Clarkson performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" on Sunday, managing to get through the lyrics without a problem, unlike unfortunate Christina Aguilera, who got some flak after botching the words at the 2011 Super Bowl.
Of course, there was more than football and music in the lineup.
Refreshment and apparel producers and advertisers have a lot at stake in the annual bash.
The average game-watcher was expected to spend $63.87 on Super Bowl merchandise, snacks and apparel, up from $59.33 last year, according to a survey by the Retail Advertising and Marketing Association. Of those watching the Giants-Patriots, nearly 27.1% planned to attend a party, according to the association, and another 15.3% planned to throw a party.
The host city of Indianapolis poured hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and corporate coin into building new hotels, sprucing up landscaping and resurfacing miles of streets.
What does Indianapolis have to offer?
The Super Bowl zip line was the talk of the town.
For $10, you could climb the zip line's 95-foot tower, attach yourself to a metal cable and fly 80 feet above the crowd to another tower 650 feet down the street. "It's the new version of the bungee jump," one woman said.
Indianapolis strove to prove it could be a major player.
It kept one key goal in mind.
"I honestly think the best report would be people saying, 'The game was great and -- oh yeah, by the way, Indianapolis was really nice. I had a really good time,' " said Tom Griswold, longtime co-host of the Indy-based syndicated radio program "The Bob & Tom Show."
CNN's Thom Patterson and Dan Moriarty and HLN's Jonathan Anker contributed to this report.

Guatemalan official: McAfee detained, could be deported to Belize
From Miguel Salay, for CNN
updated 1:14 AM EST, Thu December 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
John McAfee could be deported to Belize Thursday, a Guatemalan official says
Guatemalan immigration authorities detained him Wednesday
McAfee's lawyer has filed a request for asylum with the Guatemalan government
Guatemala City (CNN) -- Software mogul John McAfee could be deported to Belize on Thursday after being detained by immigration officials, a Guatemalan official said.
Authorities took McAfee into custody Wednesday, said Francisco Cuevas, a spokesman for Guatemala's president, Otto Perez Molina. He is accused of entering Guatemala illegally.
After weeks in hiding, the 67-year-old Internet security pioneer emerged publicly Tuesday in Guatemala's capital, hundreds of miles from the Caribbean island in Belize where his next-door neighbor was found dead.

Guatemala's foreign minister said earlier Wednesday that officials there did not know how McAfee entered the country and that there was no record of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing.
McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, filed a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday. He said McAfee left Belize to escape police persecution.

John McAfee vanishes in Belize
Belize authorities have said they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull.
"I had nothing to do with his death," McAfee wrote on his website Tuesday in a message to Faull's family. "I have lost five close family members in my 67 years and I know your suffering."

McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008.
The case began to unfold on November 9, when McAfee told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said.
Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. McAfee lived in the remote northern part of Ambergris Caye.

Two days later, someone shot Faull in the head in his own living room. A 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor.
McAfee told CNN in the interview that he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man.
He said he will not surrender to police for questioning, adding that his priority is to clear his name.
Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads.
A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated that McAfee's fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments.

Escape to the Outer Banks
By Michael H. Cottman, Special to CNN
updated 10:21 AM EDT, Mon August 12, 2013
The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in Buxton is an iconic North Carolina landmark. Climb to the top for sweeping ocean views.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
North Carolina's Outer Banks make for a fun family trip
Dolphin tours and pirate history appeal to visitors of all ages
Visit Wright Brothers National Memorial for aviation history
(CNN) -- Cruising along the Roanoke Sound, 20 bottlenose dolphins crisscrossed the currents as my family and I toured the Outer Banks of North Carolina in a slow-and-easy, 55-foot pontoon.
On a warm summer evening, we joined Captain Johnny's Outer Banks Dolphin Tours in Manteo, North Carolina, which is across the bridge on Roanoke Island.
There are three simple words that tourists are encouraged to shout once someone spots dolphins: "There they are!" (Even the most cautious adult sightseers can't resist yelling when they see a dolphin skimming the surf.)

Captain Johnny's guarantees dolphin sightings on each cruise, and the popular boat tour enterprise doesn't disappoint. Halfway through our two-hour cruise, I stopped counting after spotting about 30 playful dolphins surrounding our boat.
Cape Hatteras National Seashore offers beautiful beaches, of course, but much more. Stop by next week for Olympic National Park.
Cape Hatteras National Seashore is one of the northern-most ranges for sea turtle nesting on the East Coast.
Brown pelicans like to fly circles over the ocean before dive-bombing into the water to catch fish.

Far out on the Outer Banks
"This is a very active group of dolphins today," our guide told us. "We don't know how many dolphins we'll see each day -- but we do know we'll find them."
The dolphin watch cruise -- a must-do activity for families -- leaves from a bayside dock in Manteo, a quaint waterfront town on the eastern side of Roanoke Island where in the late 1800s every store lining the waterfront had a door to come ashore by boat.
Roanoke Island is part of a string of barrier islands that stretches 200 miles along the North Carolina coast.
Driving to the Outer Banks is a great road trip for families; it's a destination that has something for everyone: inexpensive seaside restaurants serving fresh seafood and burgers, boutique shops and outlet stores, mini-golf, boardwalks, fishing, boat tours, ice cream and fudge shops, jet-ski rentals, hang gliding and a range of hotels, bed and breakfasts and oceanfront rental homes and condos.
There are three popular islands in the Outer Banks -- Bodie, Roanoke and Hatteras, each with its distinct charm and history but all with some common features: sandy beaches and spectacular ocean views.
Bodie Island includes the communities of Duck, Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills. Visit the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kill Devil Hills, where the first flight took off on December 17, 1903.
Stop in Nags Head, home to the largest sand dune on the East Coast, Jockey's Ridge, and check out dozens of gorgeous high-end homes. Also visit Jennette's Pier for lunch or dinner, fishing and great ocean scenery. The 1,000-foot pier is the oldest pier in the Outer Banks and a great hangout for children.
Check out Duck, which boasts seven miles of pristine beaches, bike paths and jet skiing. Be sure to walk through town and pick up a pint of homemade ice cream.
On Hatteras Island, visit the Hatteras Island Visitor Center and Museum of the Sea at the historic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Double Keepers' Quarters. Also tour the lighthouse. The first Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was lit in 1803, according to the National Park Service. At nearly 200 feet tall, the current structure is the tallest brick lighthouse in the United States. Take time to climb the lighthouse. It's a fun experience for the entire family.
For maritime buffs, also stop by the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum in Hatteras Village. Exhibits include evidence of numerous shipwrecks around the Outer Banks, the result of treacherous seas.
If you're a pirate enthusiast, then Ocracoke Island, south of Hatteras, is the place for you. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, the Outer Banks was a secret base for pirates. They hijacked Spanish and British ships carrying gold and silver and stashed the booty in the crevices of the Outer Banks.
The most famous pirate of the Outer Banks was Edward Teach, also known as "Blackbeard," who frequented Ocracoke. Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge, wrecked off the coast of the Outer Banks in 1718.
For an evening of entertainment and history, plan to see the theatrical stage production "The Lost Colony," the dramatic story of 113 colonists who mysteriously disappeared on Roanoke Island in 1590. The musical is performed in an amphitheater in Manteo, on Roanoke Island, on a stage that is three times the size of most Broadway productions.
English families first settled in the Outer Banks in 1587, and many descendants of the early British pioneers still live on Roanoke Island today.
Don't miss the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island, which features the largest collection of sharks in the state as well as an outstanding interactive exhibit for kids called Operation: Sea Turtle Rescue. The 68,000-square-foot aquarium features the Outer Banks' vast aquatic life, including horseshoe crabs, rays and alligators.
One of the most popular exhibits in the aquarium is the "touch room," where children can touch rays, horseshoe crabs, hermit crabs and other creatures in a safe and controlled environment.
A real treat for aquarium visitors is the high-velocity Hurricane Simulator that generates wind speeds of 78 mph -- the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane. Adults and children stand in line for this exhibit. Don't miss it. It will blow you away.
Where to stay
We stayed overnight in Manteo -- our base in the Outer Banks -- and drove to other places such as Nags Head, Duck, Kitty Hawk, Southern Shores, Kill Devil Hills and Pea Island, the site of the first all-black U.S. Coast Guard life-saving station in the late 1800s.
For couples, the Roanoke Bungalow is a charming bed and breakfast on a quiet street in Manteo. This family-owned home, originally built in the 1930s, has been renovated and transformed into a delightful and relaxing B&B. And Cheryl Wiggins prepares an outstanding continental breakfast each morning.
Also try the Tranquil House Inn in the heart of town. Our second-floor room overlooked the bay and marina. The wine and cheese reception every evening is a nice touch, and a tasty breakfast is included each morning. Rooms are spacious, and the hotel is within walking distance of most local activities.
Where to eat For a great meal and a wonderful atmosphere, try 1587, the Tranquil House Inn's restaurant. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. If the mahi-mahi is on the menu, order it. Ask for a table overlooking the marina.
For excellent traditional Latin food try La Cabana. It's inexpensive, great food and large potions. Try the empanadas, chicken stew and seafood dishes.
Travel tip
If you decide on Captain Johnny's Outer Banks Dolphin Tours, consider the 6 p.m. excursion: The dolphin tour also becomes a fantastic sunset cruise.
