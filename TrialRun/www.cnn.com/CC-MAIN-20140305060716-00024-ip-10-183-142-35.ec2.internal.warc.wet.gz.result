Pentagon spokeswoman stepping down
Victoria Clarke
Story Tools
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke, the U.S. Defense Department's most visible woman, is leaving her post at the end of the week, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced Monday.
In a short statement, Rumsfeld said Clarke would "be sorely missed."
"Torie Clarke is a gifted communicator," he said. "During her remarkable two years of service in the Department of Defense, she has developed countless new methods to tell the story of our fighting forces and bring their courage, dedication and professionalism into sharp focus for all Americans."
Clarke, citing personal reasons for her resignation, said working for the U.S. military "has been a true honor."
"I depart sadly because this has been the best professional experience of my life," she said.
Clarke did not indicate what her next steps would be.
Lawrence DiRita, special assistant to Rumsfeld, will assume Clarke's duties until a permanent replacement is confirmed, according to the defense secretary.
Before becoming assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, Clarke was the general manager of the Washington office of Hill & Knowlton, a global public relations and marketing firm.
Her career as a political spokeswoman began when she graduated from George Washington University with a bachelor's degree and became a press assistant to then-Vice President George Bush in 1982.
Clarke was a press secretary for U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, an assistant U.S. trade representative and press secretary for the re-election campaign of President Bush in 1992.

Special report: Attacks in Mumbai
• Police were reporting Friday that the standoff at the Oberoi was over. Two gunmen were killed as authorities cleared the hotel, said J.K. Dutt, the National Security Guard's director-general. Thirty-six people were found dead there, according to Bhushan Gagrani, a Maharashtra state official. • At various times Saturday morning, gunfire and explosions could be heard as security forces worked to clear the Taj of at least one remaining gunman. • Shortly before 9 a.m. Saturday local time, Dutt said that three militants had been killed but that security personnel still needed to search the hotel for civilians and any possible remaining gunmen. His comments came shortly after Mumbai Police Chief Hussain Gafoor told CNN-IBN that the last militants at the Taj had been killed. The statements coincided with an apparent end of gunfire at the hotel. • By Friday night, 160 had been killed in the Mumbai attacks, including at least 15 foreign nationals, authorities said. These included five Americans, three Germans, an Italian, an Australian and one Chinese. • The official death toll did not include attackers who were killed by security forces. R.R. Patel, the Maharashtra home minister, said Friday that nine attackers had been killed. • More than 300 people were wounded, including seven Britons, three Americans and two Australians. • Two of the killed Americans were identified as Alan Scherr, 58, and his daughter Naomi, 13, both of Virginia. The two, who were visiting India with a meditation group, died at the Oberoi. • Also among the dead were 16 police officers, two commandos and the chief of the Mumbai police anti-terror squad. • CNN-IBN quoted police sources as saying there were about 26 gunmen. • Authorities found 8 kilograms (17 pounds) of RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, at a restaurant near the Taj. • The Indian navy, stepping up patrols on the country's western coast after the attack, was questioning the crew of the MV Alpha, a ship detained with the help of the Indian coast guard, British authorities said. The authorities said that they think the attackers' boats came from this ship and that they think the ship is from Karachi, Pakistan. • Several Indian news outlets reported that a group called the Deccan Mujahideen e-mailed them to claim responsibility for the attacks. Intelligence officials say little is known about the group. U.S. officials and security analysts say the sophistication of the attacks may indicate that a more-established group is involved. • State media Press Trust of India, citing Union Cabinet Minister Kapil Sibal, reported the gunmen had worked for months to prepare, even setting up "control rooms" in the two luxury hotels that were targeted.

Exploring the anti-social side of social mediaBy Patrick Oppmann, CNN | Filed under: Social Media Cristin Norine is connected to the outside world only by social mediaSTORY HIGHLIGHTS Cristin Norine has isolated herself in a glass room for 30 days She wants to explore how social media has changed the way people communicate "We think we are being social on these gadgets," Norine says Her public isolation project ends on December 1 Portland, Oregon (CNN) -- People walking by the floor-to-ceiling glass windows surrounding Cristin Norine could be excused for thinking that she is working in an office alone or lives in a ground-level apartment in dire need of drapes. She does not look like a prisoner. But for 30 days that's exactly what Norine is. Her "cell" is a large storefront that sat unrented for months until the owner decided to let artists use it as a gallery so it wouldn't look so empty. Norine has moved in donated furniture, exercise equipment and a large-screen computer with a projector overhead so everyone walking by can see as she tweets, updates her Facebook page and Skypes. During her stay no one comes in and Norine never goes outside. Her only contact with other people is through technology. In that regard, Norine says she is not that different from anyone else. "We think we are being social on these gadgets," she said. "And it can be a really great thing when people live in different states, but when you are at dinner or you are trying to have a conversation and you are being distracted by these other things. Or maybe you are just not going out as much because you are staying home and are online." Usually a TV and photography production manager based in Los Angeles, California, Norine ended up in her own personal fishbowl in Portland after a chance meeting with Josh Elliott. Gallery: Public isolation project

Married couples: Thou shall not Facebook
Elliott worked in photography in Oregon and the two realized they shared a similar curiosity about the effects that the barrage of new technologies are having on people. Elliott knew about the available storefront and almost overnight, Norine moved in. The Public Isolation Project was born. As she literally X's off the 30 days she is spending cut off from the world, Norine chronicles her experience through her blog http://www.publicisolationproject.com/. On the other side of the glass, Elliott is filming a documentary on their collaboration. They are not anti-technology, Elliott says, just hoping to inspire more conversation about how everything from the internet to iPads are shaping people's lives. "We are accessible 24/7," Elliott says. "Having a cell phone in your pocket you can be called or texted or video chatted at any point. With Facebook you are updating all time. You have friends on Facebook that you have never met, and they know more about what's going on in your life than your mother does who is not on Facebook." Norine puts herself out there in a way that would make the most avid Twitterer or Facebook addict suffer an attack of shyness. She eats, exercises and sleeps in full view of a busy Portland street. With a bathroom as her only private area, she is on almost constant display. Norine's exhibitionism is extreme but hardly unique. Last month, the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry held a prize for a contestant to move to the museum for a month and become a living exhibit. Some 1,500 people applied. In 2004, a Malaysian woman set a record for enduring 32 days in a glass box with hundreds of scorpions as company. In 2000, an actress living in a glass house in Chile inspired protests after taking public showers. Elliott says the near total lack of privacy takes a toll on Norine. We think we are being social on these gadgets. --Cristin Norine RELATED TOPICS

"Even on a Sunday when she just wants to take a break from this and have a cup of coffee," he said, "There's people coming up and knocking on the window. She just doesn't have any time for herself and I think that's hard." Norine admits she didn't think she would make it past two weeks and has what she calls "the bad days." On day 16 of her blog she writes, "Went to bed before 9 p.m. I wasn't feeling well and was too tired to write. ... I could really use some fresh air." But she says having a routine has made the experiment more bearable. "I get up, I make myself coffee and breakfast and get ready." Norine says. "Some days I'll be working out. Then I get on the computer and do my work -- I try to take a lunch break. I even have people who will come and have lunch with me on the other side of the window." Norine e-mails and Skypes and chats online with anyone who wants to know more about her and the project. Until, she says, the overload sets in. "I'll realize I need to take a break," Norine says. "And I'll go and do something that doesn't have to do with the computer and I can't turn it off. I still hear those dings and I get drawn back to the computer. I definitely have noticed since I have been here that I am addicted!" The project ends on December 1 and Norine says she yearns for human interaction, a good meal and to hear live music. Even if Norine can't wait to leave her self-imposed prison, she and the project have changed the surrounding neighborhood. People who walk by her every day on their way to work stop for a few brief seconds to wave hello. Day laborers awaiting work across the street watch her moving around the living space as if it were a favorite soap opera. New friends pop by and hold notes against the window. A woman who only gives her name as Debra watches Norine intently for several minutes before saying, "I know what it's like: I have an infant and I get stuck in my house all the time and I find myself so hungry for adult conversation."

Blackmailers threaten new blasts in Ukrainian town By Maxim Tkachenko, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Yanukovych is cutting short his visit to Japan to return homeA letter said five more blasts would take place if money is not receivedLocal media report the writers of the letter demanded 4 million eurosNo one was injured in the blasts, the security service said Moscow (CNN) -- Two explosions damaged a phone booth and a building in eastern Ukraine early Thursday, and the apparent perpetrators promised more blasts if they do not receive a large sum of money, the Ukrainian Security Service said. No one was injured in the explosions in the city of Makiivka, about 450 miles southeast of the capital, Kyiv, the security service said on its website. At a news conference in Kyiv, Deputy Interior Minister Vasyl Farynnyk said an anonymous threat letter was left at the scene of one of the blasts, vowing five more explosions by the end of the day if the authors do not receive the money, according to Ukrainian media reports. The first bomb exploded in a phone booth near a downtown shopping center, and the other one took place about 30 minutes later outside the office building of the state-owned coal enterprise, Ukraine's independent news agency UNIAN said. Farynnyk said an envelope was glued to the wall of the office building, containing a demand for a large sum of money from "people who are well-known in Makiivka," as they called themselves, Ukrainian media reported. The letter, according to Farynnyk, contained instructions on how to conduct the money transfer. The independent news agency Ukranews quoted other security officials as saying that the blackmailers were demanding that the government pay them 4 million euros. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was on an official visit to Japan, decided to cut short his trip and return home, according to a statement on his official website. When he gets back, he will meet with law enforcement and security chiefs, the statement said. In the meantime, he has instructed law enforcement agencies to tighten security in all regions of the country, the statement added. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry reported on its website that an investigative task force has been established with several law enforcement agencies and counterterrorism units. "The regional headquarters of the Anti-terrorist Center of the Security Service has consolidated all its efforts to identify the criminals and prevent new terror acts," said a statement on the Security Service website. Additional police officers and demolition experts were dispatched to the area, according to local media.

Program to allow Mexican trucks on U.S. roads off to slow start
By Mike M. Ahlers, CNN
updated 10:34 AM EDT, Wed September 5, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Just six Mexican trucking companies are participating in the program so far
As of July, Mexican trucks had made fewer than 100 long-haul trips into the U.S.
U.S. auditors must prepare a congressionally mandated study of the program's safety
The auditors fear with so few participants, they won't be able to complete the study
Washington (CNN) -- A year after Mexican trucks were first permitted to conduct long-haul operations in the United States, so few trucks have signed up for the pilot program that government auditors fear they won't be able to complete a congressionally mandated study of the program's safety.
Only six Mexican trucking companies -- most with a single truck -- are participating in the program thus far, with some 24 other companies under review. As of July, Mexican trucks had made fewer than 100 long-haul trips into the United States.
Unless the number of participating trucks increases significantly, the Department of Transportation's inspector general says, the department will not have the data needed to determine whether Mexican trucks present a danger on U.S. highways.
The low participation seemingly belies critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, who feared the agreement would unloose thousands of Mexican trucks on U.S. highways, displacing American trucks and endangering American lives.
But opponents of the program attribute the low participation to other factors, including bureaucratic roadblocks to participation, the trade imbalance and a reluctance by Mexican companies to join a temporary program. The opponents say they remain fearful that the program ultimately will hurt American trucking jobs.
Further, they said the inspector general's report confirms fears the U.S. government will not hold Mexican trucks and truckers to the same safety standards as their U.S. counterparts.
"The Inspector Generals report pretty much has confirmed everything that our organization has contended since Day One," said Todd Spencer of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has applied a "double standard" to Mexican operations, he said.
The report says FMCSA auditors allowed Mexican drivers to respond in Spanish to test questions, and that some Mexican drivers were unable to explain the meaning of signs labeled "Railroad Crossing" and "Wrong Way." And one FMCSA auditor did not investigate why one Mexican trucking company submitted a report containing incomplete drug and alcohol tests.
The FMCSA said it has taken steps to address problems uncovered by the inspector general. It now requires English responses to questions about traffic and road signs, and requires testing of all 21 signs used in the test.
"Safety is our first priority, and we will continue to look for ways to improve our program," the agency said in a statement to CNN. "The agency has already incorporated several important safety recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General."
As for program participation, the FMCSA said it is working with the Mexican government to provide program information to other trucking companies.
"The agency recognizes that statistically valid results will require much broader participation," the FMCSA told the inspector general.
Under the program, approved Mexican trucks are allowed to carry Mexican goods throughout the United States -- well beyond the commercial zone in border states where they previously had to off-load.
Before receiving permanent long-haul authority, participants must go through a series of inspections and safety evaluations. The program is not open to hazardous material trucks or passenger carriers.
To date, the Department of Transportation says, none of the participating Mexican carriers has had a reportable crash in the United States since joining the program.
Supporters of the program blame the low participation on the temporary nature of the program.
"It's a bit of a 'Catch-22' because the Mexican trucks have been yanked around so long they are hesitant to spend the money on a pilot program," said James Clark, director of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce's Mexico Business Center. "I think they are concerned about making an investment in something that might be temporary."
"Many of them say, 'To hell with it. We have enough business in our own country,'" Clark said.
Clark dismissed concerns that Mexican trucks were less safe than U.S. rigs.
"I think it's a jobs concern disguised as a safety issue," he said. "I mean they can frighten people by saying, 'Oh my God, They'll have these old ramshackled trucks (on U.S. roads).'"
But, he said, that trucks "have to pass the exact same safety standards" as U.S. trucks, and the drivers must be equally qualified.

Akin passes on last chance to drop out, Republicans write off Senate seat
By Dana Bash, CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent
updated 8:00 PM EDT, Tue September 25, 2012
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is backing the embattled Senate bid of Rep. Todd Akin, background. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
After controversial comments on rape, Todd Akin pressured by GOP leaders to drop out
Missouri congressman still has some support from conservatives
Some Republican strategists admit Missouri situation damages hopes of winning Senate control
Washington (CNN) -- Instead giving in to fellow Republicans desperate for him to drop out of the Missouri Senate race, a defiant Todd Akin gathered conservative supporters and launched a campaign bus tour.
"I have one purpose going into November and that's replacing [Democratic Senator] Claire McCaskill," the congressman said to an applauding crowd in St. Louis on Tuesday, the last day state law permitted him to remove his name from the ballot.
"A number of people have asked me if I'm dropping out," said Akin, whose controversial comments on rape and pregnancy in August triggered a national uproar and turned him into a political pariah.
He added that this is "not my decision," but rather the decision of Republican voters who chose him this summer as their candidate against McCaskill in a race considered crucial for control of the Senate.
Akin ad focuses on McCaskill
Get Real! Akin's wife uses rape metaphor
Paul Ryan: Akin 'should have dropped out'
Law: Akin's 'mortal blow' to candidacy
Senior Republican sources told CNN that they gave up on pushing Akin out of the contest some time ago after he refused to bow to pressure. The Republican Party chairman, GOP congressional leaders, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan joined together to publicly call on him to step aside.
Ryan telephoned Akin to try to convince him to go.
"Probably the best thing for Todd to do, for his own campaign and for the country, is not to run," Ryan said at the time.
Akin deflects question on 'rape' comment in debate
Republican Party leaders had counted on beating McCaskill, long considered one of the Senate's most endangered Democrats, but they have all but given up. They won't give Akin a dime, nor will leading outside groups with deep pockets like Crossroads GPS.
Huckabee, Gingrich blast Rove for 'murder' comment
But Akin still has support from some high-profile conservatives like Newt Gingrich, who is helping to raise money.
The former House speaker campaigned with Akin on Monday and chastised the GOP establishment for abandoning him. Akin backers are also hoping to win support and money from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, who has a track record of helping the most conservative Senate candidates.
Huckabee rallies Missouri pastors to Akin's side
Akin advisers insist that polls show he is still competitive and that national Republicans will have egg on their faces when he proves them wrong by winning in November.
But national GOP strategists say they believe the only reason the race is close is because McCaskill has been waiting for the legal deadline for Akin to drop out to pass before going after him.
She agrees with national Republicans that Akin is the most beatable of any GOP candidate -- especially since his incendiary gaffe. McCaskill has been limiting her television ads to promoting herself instead of slamming her opponent.
Republican strategists who have written off the Missouri race admit it has put GOP chances for seizing the Senate majority at major risk.
A look the math helps explain why: Republicans currently hold 47 of 100 seats. To win outright control, they must pick up four seats that are held by Democrats, assuming they lose none themselves.
The most likely place for a GOP win is the open Democratic seat in Nebraska. Other states in the toss up column that Republican strategists say they're hoping to snatch include North Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana, Connecticut, Virginia and Ohio.
What makes the GOP road to the Senate majority even tougher is that polls show Republicans risk losing two seats: Scott Brown's in Massachusetts and the one left open in Maine by retiring Olympia Snowe.
If Republicans lose those seats, which GOP strategists tell CNN is quite possible, they admit they would have to sweep the toss-up races to take control of the chamber.
That's doable, GOP sources say, but very difficult.
Polls: GOP Senate takeover might be tougher
It's a surprising struggle for Republicans, given that the majority of senators up for re-election are Democrats, and the national climate -- namely the weak economy -- has been bad for Democrats.
Republican strategists charged with winning enough seats to retake the Senate majority told CNN that one reason it has become more difficult than they expected is because Romney is struggling in the presidential race.
That's especially true, these sources said, in the presidential battlegrounds of Virginia, Ohio and Wisconsin where Romney has fallen behind President Barack Obama and, according to one GOP source, is "dragging Senate candidates down with him."

U.S. Navy warship will have to be lifted off Philippine reef
By Brad Lendon, CNN
updated 3:06 PM EST, Fri January 25, 2013
The stern of the USS Guardian, the last piece of grounded ship, is removed by a crane vessel on Saturday, March 30. The U.S. Navy minesweeper became trapped on a reef off the western Philippine island of Palawan on January 17. The Navy has pledged to clean up debris and restore the reef as much as possible.
A crane vessel lifts the bow of the USS Guardian on Tuesday, March 26. The crane vessel pulls the bow off the ship on March 26.
The crane vessel removes a hull section on Wednesday, March 27. The U.S. Navy expects the Guardian to be completely removed from Tubbataha Reef by mid-April, an official says.
The U.S. Navy and Philippines authorities are working to dismantle the ship.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The USS Guardian has several holes in its hull, admiral says
The 1,300-ton minesweeper will have to be lifted onto a barge
The ship damaged more than 10,000 square feet of the Tubbataha Reef
The reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
(CNN) -- The U.S Navy minesweeper that grounded on a Philippine reef last week has taken on water and sustained too much damage to be towed off, the Navy says.
"It's got hull penetrations in several places, and there is a significant amount of water inside the ship," Rear Adm. Tom Carney said at a briefing Thursday.
The Navy said it will use ship-borne cranes and heavy-lift vessels to lift the minesweeper, the USS Guardian, off the Tubbataha Reef.
"As the crane ships arrive, we will take items off the Guardian to lighten the weight of the ship so we are able to remove it from the reef," Carney said. "The option that we had hoped to tow the ship off the reef is not available. The ship is too badly damaged."
The Guardian would be removed from the area on a barge or other ship, Carney said.
"The ship cannot move on its own, and it is not operational," he said.
The 224-foot-long,1,312-ton ship was on its way from Subic Bay, Philippines, to its next port call in Indonesia when it struck the reef, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea, on January 17.
Initial efforts to free the Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship at high tide were unsuccessful. Its crew of 79 was evacuated to other vessels, and the ship was battered by waves that pushed it farther onto the reef.
Carney said the Guardian now rests about 20 to 30 meters (22 to 33 yards) from the edge of the reef. Originally, only its bow was on the reef, but waves have now pushed the entire ship onto it.
Lt. Cmdr. James Stockman, a Navy spokesman in Manila, said Friday that the heavy-lift vessels would arrive at the grounding site in about a week. The guided missile destroyer USS Mustin, the oceanographic survey ship USNS Bowditch and the rescue and salvage ship USNS Salvor, as well as tugboats and Philippine navy and coast guard vessels, are on station, he said in an e-mail to CNN.
"Extracting the ship safely, while minimizing further damage to the reef, is a very complex process that requires careful and detailed planning and specialized equipment," Stockman said. "Although we are moving as expeditiously as possible, we want to ensure it is done safely while minimizing damage to the reef and surrounding environment."
It could take two weeks to remove the Guardian from the reef, Carney said.
"We are committed to moving the ship from the reef as soon as possible. ... That is the focus of all our efforts," he said.
The Navy said Friday that the ships on station have removed about 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel from the Guardian.
Carney said there have been no signs of oil or fuel leaking into the waters above the reef, which is a Philippine national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The reef is home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures, as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and one of the last surviving colonies of breeding seabirds in the region, according to UNESCO.
Philippine officials said this week that the Philippines would seek compensation for damage to the reef. About 1,000 square meters (about 10,760 square feet) of the reef have been damaged.
"It's a damage to a world heritage site. It's a damage to our natural resources. It's a damage to an important site. We cannot but put emphasis on the importance of this reef as a heritage site," presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said.
He said the salvage operation must ensure that the reef sustains no further damage.
As to how the ship got stuck on the reef in the first place, Stockman said the Navy is looking at a number of factors.
He said the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles.
"The U.S. Navy investigation will review what charts Guardian was using. While this erroneous navigation chart data is important information, no one should jump to conclusions," Stockman said. "It is critical that the U.S. Navy conduct a comprehensive investigation that assesses all the facts and circumstances surrounding the Guardian grounding."

China rocked by cash crunch, surprise fall in factory output
By Ramy Inocencio, for CNN
updated 3:54 PM EDT, Fri June 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lack of bank access to cash, surprise fall in factory output rock China
China's seven-day rate jumped to record 12% after Beijing refused new funds
China central bank aims to slow expanding debt, easy access to credit
Shanghai Composite Index has slid 10% since the start of June
Hong Kong (CNN) -- China delivered a one-two punch of negative economic data this week, hitting first with an initial report on factory activity falling to a surprise nine-month low and then with interbank lending rates rocketing to a record high.
The gloomy numbers keep fears alive that the world's second-largest economic engine is not just slowing down -- but also seizing up.
China's main seven-day repurchase rate jumped to a record 12% this Thursday, according to CME Group. China's weighted average overnight repo rate hit 13.1% -- the highest in more than a decade.
The rate spikes are a reaction to Beijing's decision earlier this week to withhold new infusions of cash into the markets. One of the central bank's aims is to slow the growth of China's ballooning debt and stop easy access to credit.
China's cash crunch a 'homegrown issue'
In China, economics influences politics China's GDP expected to grow
U.S.: China currency very 'undervalued'
The country's total debt is estimated to stand at more than 200% of GDP when debt from the central government, local governments, corporations and households are included, says Swiss bank UBS.
In April, Fitch had warned China of its high debt levels, downgrading the country's long-term currency rating. The ratings agency cited expansion of easy credit and structural weakness in China's economy.
However on Friday, repurchase rates fell on reports that China's central bank had supplied more than $8 billion in new liquidity to ease the current cash crunch.
On June 20, the same day that China's repurchase rates hit record highs, HSBC's June "flash" purchasing managers' index fell to a nine month low of 48.3. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in the country's manufacturing sector as new export orders plunged from major trading partners like the United States and Europe.
Some China watchers fear the country will miss its self-imposed 2013 growth target of 7.5%.
Since June 1, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 10%.

Five stories you missed during the royal baby coverage

5.9-magnitude earthquake leaves dozens dead in northwest China
Hezbollah's military wing designated a terrorist group by EU

Photos: Quake strikes northwest China A shallow, powerful 5.9-magnitude earthquake tore through China's Gansu Province, killing at least 89 people and injuring hundreds more, according to state media.
The original quake and powerful aftershocks caused roofs to collapse, cut telecommunications lines and damaged a major highway. Emergency services have converged on the area to try to rescue survivors.
3. Hezbollah's military wing is a terrorist group, says EU
The European Union has joined the U.S. and Israel in designating the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, but stopped short of putting the entire group on its terror list.
The Bulgarians cited evidence that the military wing of the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group was involved in a terror attack last year that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver. In Cyprus earlier this year, a court found a Hezbollah member guilty of assisting in the planning of an attack on Israel. Lately, its fighters have sided with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's civil war.
The designation, which a spokeswoman for Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni called "correct and just," would freeze the assets of Hezbollah entities.
4. Man who bombed Beijing airport wanted to flag 'unjust treatment'
The wheelchair-bound Ji Zhongxing, 34, set off a homemade explosive inside a Beijing airport on Saturday after he was stopped from handing out leaflets "to get attention to his complaints" outside the arrival hall, according to Xinhua news agency.
Ji said on his personal blog in 2006 that he had been beaten by security guards outside a police station in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle -- a charge the police denied. He was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation.
Ji was hospitalized after he detonated his explosives. No other people were injured and flights at the airport were not affected.
5. CNN Exclusive: Glee star Charice on why she'll miss Cory Monteith
In an exclusive opinion piece for CNN.com, "Glee" star Charice writes that her body went cold when she learned co-star Cory Monteith had been found dead from a drug overdose in his hotel room in Vancouver.
Charice says Monteith, who had been frank about his struggles with substance abuse in the past, was a "real talent" -- and that she has no idea what will happen to the hit American musical now that the actor is gone.
