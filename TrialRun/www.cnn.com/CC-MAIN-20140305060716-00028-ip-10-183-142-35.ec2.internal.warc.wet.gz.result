Boycotts put Arizona's reputation on the lineFrom Kristi Keck, CNN Groups across the country are calling for an economic boycott of Arizona. Here, protesters rally in New York last weekend. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Senator asks Arizona to hold off on law until Congress acts on issueOpponents of Arizona immigration law are calling for an economic boycott of stateExpert: Boycott could hurt state's reputation, lead to long-term economic consequences"History shows that boycotts backfire and harm innocent people," Arizona governor says (CNN) -- As the voice of opposition to Arizona's controversial immigration law gets louder, the state's reputation can expect to take a hit. Critics of the law are calling for economic boycotts of Arizona, urging corporations and organizations to refrain from holding conventions in the state. They're also pressuring Major League Baseball to take its 2011 All-Star Game elsewhere, much like the National Football League did in 1993 when Arizona refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday. While Arizona can ride out the backlash in the short term, the impact could hit hard later on, said Brayden King, assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. "The reputational consequences will have long-term economic consequences if it's not resolved," King said. Critics have said the law will lead to racial profiling. Supporters argue it will crack down on illegal immigration. Latino rights groups, others call for Arizona boycott Video: Sharpton leads Arizona protest

As originally passed, the bill would have allowed police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency based solely on an officer's suspicion. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill to amend the law so that officers could check a person's status only if the person had been detained or arrested for another reason. Brewer said the changes should ease concerns about racial profiling, but opponents say the changes are not sufficient. Days after the bill was signed into law, Debbie Johnson, president and CEO of the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association, said three conferences were canceled, including a gathering of the American Immigration Lawyers Association scheduled for fall. Arizona governor signs changes into immigration law Now, the calls for boycotts are coming from across the country. The Boston City Council approved a resolution calling on the Massachusetts city to pull investments from Arizona. The Oakland, California, City Council voted this week to boycott Arizona businesses. Chris Coleman, mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, banned city-funded travel to the state. Coleman also planned to write letters to the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national committees, encouraging them not to choose Phoenix as the host city for their 2012 conventions. In Arizona, the Tucson and Flagstaff city councils voted this week to file suit against the immigration law. The city councils said they're taking action because of concerns over enforcement costs and negative effects on Arizona's tourism industry. Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup said up to 38 percent of retail sales in the city come from legal Mexican visitors. The Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association has set up a Facebook page titled "Don't Boycott AZ Tourism," which urges visitors not to scapegoat the tourist industry and its workers. Supporters of the law outside of the state are mobilizing. Organizers with Voice of the People USA and Tea Party Patriots Live announced Thursday they planned to hold rallies in Phoenix and across the country the week of June 5 to counter any boycotts and show support for the immigration law. Brewer has dismissed the notion that the state's immigration law would hurt economic development, saying many businesses have long wanted tougher action. The law is slated to go into effect late this summer unless court challenges hold it up. What does the law do? In an editorial on ESPN.com, Brewer said the recent boycotts and calls for MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to move next year's All-Star game are misguided. "Put simply, history shows that boycotts backfire and harm innocent people. Boycotts are just more politics and manipulation by out-of-state interests. As a border state, Arizona has already paid a heavy price for the federal government's failure -- hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in unreimbursed costs -- and its citizens should not be punished further," she wrote in the Wednesday article. But King, the Northwestern professor, said history also has shown the opposite to be true. Citing the Boston Tea Party in the 1770s and the civil rights-era boycotts in the South, King noted, "Those did not hurt the innocent, and they had real impact on political and social change." A majority of Americans support Arizona's law, even though most of them think it could lead to racial profiling, according to a recent national poll. A CBS/New York Times survey released Tuesday indicates that Americans overwhelmingly believe that the country's immigration laws need to be changed. A Gallup Poll released last week showed similar public attitudes: Nearly four in 10 Americans supported the law, with three in 10 opposed, and 31 percent saying they had not heard of the new law at the time, or had no opinion. While the boycotts are keeping the law in the spotlight, King predicted that even those apathetic about the issue could take a side. "Even people who wouldn't have cared in the first place are now becoming aware of it and are starting to develop opinions about it. They may have been lukewarm or moderate in the beginning, but they are probably becoming polarized as they become more educated about the issue," he said, noting that Arizonans' opinion on the issue could change as well. "[Brewer's] constituents will not be happy if Arizona loses major business revenue like a Super Bowl or an All-Star Game," he said. "Even if their own pocketbook is not being affected, they're not going to want to be associated with that kind of negative press." Brewer is rejecting a request from a top Senate Democrat to hold the immigration bill for one year to give Congress time to pass comprehensive immigration reform. In a letter dated Thursday and obtained by CNN, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, made the request to Brewer, a Republican. Schumer, the Senate Democrats' point man for immigration reform, called Arizona's concerns about illegal immigration "legitimate security interests" and said he appreciates that Brewer "felt duty-bound to take action to address the security concerns in your state." "But I simply do not believe the remedy Arizona has enacted will succeed in resolving the problem it is designed to address," Schumer wrote. He called the law, "wrong-hearted" and "likely unconstitutional." He also asked Brewer to call on Arizona's two GOP senators - John McCain and Jon Kyl - to "immediately begin discussions with me to enact" immigration reform. On Friday, Brewer's office informed CNN of the governor's response. "The governor is certainly grateful that Sen. Schumer has focused some attention on Arizona's border security plight," said Paul Senseman, Brewer's deputy chief of staff for communications. But, Senseman continued, Brewer "is waiting for action on border security." Attempting to highlight federal inaction on the matter, Senseman referred to a letter sent from border state governors, including Brewer, to Congressional leaders in April 2009. It called for more National Guard personnel to help local law enforcement agencies combat violence, crime and illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border. "The governor has been waiting over a year," Senseman told CNN in reaction to Schumer's letter.CNN's A. Pawlowski contributed to this report. Share this on:

EPA official blasted over 'crucify' oil and gas comments By Todd Sperry, CNN Senior Producer
updated 6:30 PM EDT, Thu April 26, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dallas EPA chief draws criticism for 2010 video
In video, Al Armendariz relates his strategy for dealing with energy firms that break rules
He notes the Romans would "find the first five guys they saw and crucify them"
Washington (CNN) -- The White House and the Environmental Protection Agency are distancing themselves from controversial remarks that surfaced this week by a regional administrator attacking the oil and gas industry.
In a video made in 2010, Al Armendariz, who heads the EPA's Dallas office, suggested his approach to dealing with noncompliant oil and gas companies is "like when the Romans conquered the villages in the Mediterranean, they'd go into little villages in Turkish towns and they'd find the first five guys they saw and crucify them."
Sen. James Inhofe, who posted the video online Wednesday, blasted the EPA administrator's comments on the Senate floor during a 30-minute speech attacking the Obama administration's energy policy. "His comments give us a rare glimpse into the Obama administration's true agenda," the Oklahoma Republican said.
The White House and the EPA were quick to clarify they didn't agree with Armendariz's remarks. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday, "The official's comments are inaccurate as a representation or characterization of the way the EPA has operated under President Obama."
The EPA released a statement on its website, saying, "It is deeply unfortunate that in a 2010 video an EPA official inaccurately suggested we are seeking to 'make examples' out of certain companies in the oil and gas industry."
Armendariz, appointed by President Obama in 2009, apologized for the remarks, "It was an offensive and inaccurate way to portray our efforts to address potential violations of our nation's environmental laws."
But Inhofe rejected the apology. "Administrator Armendariz apologized yesterday for his 'poor choice of words' when he admitted that EPA's 'general philosophy' is to 'crucify' and 'make examples' of oil and gas companies, but he did not apologize for EPA's actions towards its apparent crucifixion victims."
Inhofe added, "Take the word 'crucify' out of Administrator Armendariz's statement and nothing has changed: You still have a rogue agency following through on President Obama's 'general philosophy' to increase the price of gas and electricity."
The EPA did not respond to multiple attempts from CNN to answer questions regarding Armendariz's future with the agency, whether he'll face disciplinary action or if EPA Chief Lisa Jackson has spoken with him directly.

Decluttering before the New Year
By Maureen Jenkins, Special to CNN
updated 12:17 AM EST, Thu December 27, 2012
Time off work during the holidays is a perfect time to tidy up your home and work spaces to start the New Year right.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Do your New Year's resolutions include a push to clean up? Here are some tips to start
Being organized is about being in control, says professional organizer Susan Fleischman
Cleaning clutter can eliminate the need to buy what you simply can't find
(CNN) -- Whatever other resolutions we make leading up to the New Year -- to call Mom more often, lay off the late-night snacks -- getting ourselves organized is likely near the top of the list. And that often means clearing out the clutter that keeps us from functioning efficiently, whether we're at work or at home.
Many employees -- whether they go to actual offices or do their jobs from home -- find the last week of the calendar year is ideal for sorting through e-mails, clearing their desks, and reorganizing their work spaces. Sorting through stuff is rarely fun, but those who tackle it now will find themselves a step ahead when their now-vacationing colleagues and clients come staggering back after the holidays.
According to the National Association of Professional Organizers, which sponsors the annual "Get Organized Month" each January to help folks take control of their time, tasks and possessions, 83% of members polled say that "paper organization" ranks highest on their individual and corporate clients' to-do lists. For people taking time off between Christmas and New Year's, this week offers a chance to get things in order before 2013 arrives.
Devoting time to both physically and mentally clearing out the "old" and embracing the "new" is about more than just getting rid of stuff. Being organized is really about being in control, says Susan Fleischman, a Chicago-based professional organizer, home stager and founder of clutterfree.
Stay in touch!
Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. "Like" us on Facebook and have your say! Get the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.
"As joyous as the holidays can be, the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's is probably one of the most stressful of the year for people," she says. That's why spending the week after Christmas decluttering "really helps you recover and detox from the hustle and bustle of the holidays.
"It's very symbolic -- we're ramping up to the ultimate do-over. We all get to turn the calendar page and make a fresh start."
For those at work, says Fleischman, "the phone stops ringing, there are fewer meetings. Real work probably comes to a screeching halt. There are far fewer reasons to keep letting getting organized fall to the bottom of the to-do list." And these days, when employees often feel compelled to work harder and longer, being organized can be a real competitive advantage.
NAPO Industry Member Director Mary Dykstra says that on average, Americans waste time amounting to between six and 12 weeks a year searching for things in their offices and homes. "Just imagine if you could get out from under that clutter and spend that time helping your company build their business and ultimately, your career," says Fleischman, who was a public relations and marketing executive before launching her professional organizing business.
Mackenzie Phillips declutters home
"Every minute counts when it comes to impressing the boss, your colleagues and clients. At work, we strive to project that we're knowledgeable, in control and experts. We're constantly accessing, sharing, reacting to information. Being able to put your hands on the information or generate some information means the better you'll be able to rise to the top and have clarity of thought and creativity and maximize productivity."
But what about moving from work to the home front? Cynthia Ewer, the Washington state-based editor of OrganizedHome.com and the author of "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Organized Fast-Track," suggests we use this in-between-holidays week to step back and reflect on our habits and how well they're working for us at home.
It's important to remember, says Ewer, that "there are different personality types. "Organized" is what works for you. There are filers -- people who love folders. They want the serenity of knowing where things are. Pilers like to keep their eyes on their stuff. Deniers have bags of paperwork shoved into closets. Instead of using a "What-does-it-look-like?" yardstick, it's a "How-will-it-work?" question. Know yourself, and come up with solutions that reflect who you are, she says.
After all, she says, " 'It's here somewhere' is the most frustrating phrase in the English language."
Cutting clutter also can boost the bottom line. "How many times do you go to the store and buy the things you couldn't find?" asks Fleischman. But cleaning up and cleaning out also can generate money, says Ewer.
"It can be a real fun process to turn your clutter into cash."
Nab tax deductions by donating cleared-out items to nonprofit organizations. Declutterers can send usable books, DVDs, video games and music to third-party merchants in exchange for gift cards through the Amazon Trade-In Program. Even computer manufacturers like Apple offer gift cards to customers who send in an old iPhone, iPad or computer for reuse or recycling, if those devices still have monetary value.
"Leading an orderly life is about saving time, saving money, reducing stress," says Fleischman, who also blogs about organizing tips and clutter makeovers. "And that's energy you can spend on leisure pursuits, which is very important to emotional well-being."
Some tips for cutting through the workplace and home clutter this holiday week:
• Stockpile your supplies. Fleischman advises making sure you've got the right trash bins, shredders, file folders and markers at your fingertips before you start sorting and tossing. • Take it a zone at a time. Your office, home and car didn't become a mess overnight, so declutter in increments. Fleischman suggests starting with desktops, then floors, then moving on to file cabinets and bookcases.
• Go from horizontal to vertical piles. If you're purging papers, clear those piles from your desk and the floor by placing newly sorted files in a cabinet or an upright vertical file. This way, your eyes can quickly scan and identify what you need at a glance.
• Free up the fridge. "Get the ghosts of Christmas past out of there -- all those little cans of this and that, the beef sticks from the gift basket no one can bear to throw out," says Ewer. Besides, this clean-up also will save you some calories.
• Be realistic. If you really write out bills at the kitchen table and not in the home office, says Ewer, get yourself a wheeled cart you can roll where the work gets done. If your kids' toys actually live in the family room -- not in the bedroom toy box -- create a storage solution there.
"Look at your patterns of living and organize yourself accordingly."

Flu vaccine attitudes abroad differ from U.S.
By Jen Christensen, CNN
updated 11:20 AM EST, Thu January 17, 2013
This year's flu shot is 62% effective, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The U.S. and Canada are the only countries to suggest vaccinating nearly everyone
This year's flu vaccine is only 62% effective.
Some worry that enthusiasm for the vaccine stops progress on more effective ones
(CNN) -- The flu hasn't hit Europe as hard as it has the United States, health officials say, but when and if it does, don't expect a call for vaccination of the entire population.
Only the U.S. and Canada actually encourage everyone older than 6 months to get the flu vaccine.
Apparently, not a single country in Europe asks the general population to seek that same kind of protection, according to Robb Butler, the World Health Organization technical officer in vaccine preventable diseases and immunizations in the organization's Europe office in the Netherlands.
That's because global health experts say the data aren't there yet to support this kind of blanket vaccination policy, nor is there enough money. In fact, some scientists say the enthusiasm for mass vaccination in the United States may hurt efforts to create a better vaccine.

CDC director takes your flu questions
Are we near a flu peak?
This year, a year in which the vaccine is supposed to be a good match to the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the vaccine is only 62% effective.
And in the segments of the population that are most susceptible to the extreme effects of the flu -- like the elderly, who make up the majority of the cases of flu-related deaths -- the vaccinations are even less effective.
So is why is everyone urged to get vaccinated?
Three things we don't know about the flu Simply put, it's a clearer policy, and some protection is better than none at all, according to Dr. William Schaffner, the chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. He was also on the national committee that made the decision to encourage everyone to get vaccinated.
"It was debated by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for many years, and the indication for the use of influenza vaccine for an increasing number of groups on a piecemeal basis didn't make sense," Schaffner said.
In 2010, the CDC expanded its guidance encouraging the vaccination of vulnerable population groups.
"When you do the back-of-the-envelope calculations (of all the separate groups recommended for vaccination), you are actually already making a recommendation that 75% of the population get it," Schaffner said. "And when it became apparent the issue of shortages was largely put on the back burner, then in 2010, we said, 'Let's simplify this and recommended this vaccine for anyone over 6 months old.'"
Regulators approve new insect-based flu vaccine
It also helps that the flu vaccine is easy to get, he said. Pharmacies offer it. Companies sometimes bring in nurses to give shots to their employees on site. In Europe, only doctors are legally allowed to administer the vaccine, according to Butler.
There may be another economic reason for more Americans to get vaccinated -- one in three U.S. workers get no paid time off when they are sick, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Generally, Europeans have much more generous sick leave policies.
"Although flu can be unpleasant, if you are otherwise healthy, the illness will usually clear up on its own and you will recover within a week," according to Britain's National Health Service website.
Homemade survival kits battle the flu
In a contrast to U.S. policy, the World Health Organization recommends only six "priority populations" get "the flu jab," as it's called in Britain.
These six groups are nursing home residents, people with chronic medical conditions like asthma, the elderly, pregnant women, health care workers, and children from ages 6 months to 2 years, Butler said. They are more vulnerable to the severe effects of the flu or come into contact more often with this highly contagious virus.
"We think the recommendations we have right now (are) a good start," Butler said. "Universal campaigns are quite challenging and expensive.
"We have 53 countries in our region that all have different recommendations based on different studies and evidence, and the depth of evidence in Europe right now is pretty limited in terms of flu vaccines. We would need more evidence that more than these six key, target high-risk groups that are prioritized can benefit. "
Online speculation says the U.S. call for general vaccination is merely a plot by drug companies to make a big profit.
Flu vaccine poses no risk to unborn
Shaffner says he hears that a lot, but it's simply not true.
"I have received e-mails after people hear me encourage people to get the influenza vaccine, and they tell me I'm part of some sort of pharmacy company conspiracy and that I'm compromised by them. But influenza vaccines are not real blockbuster money-making drugs," Shaffner said.
"If I could take some of these skeptics and bring them to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, they would see how carefully the members debate these issues -- and it really is all for the benefit of the children and adults to prevent infectious diseases."
Influenza: By the numbers
Michael Osterholm, director of the Minnesota Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance at the University of Minnesota, believes people should get the vaccine, but he worries that the current policy gives the impression the vaccine is more effective than it actually is.
"This enthusiasm to get more people vaccinated gets in the way of a critical look at the science," Osterholm said.
Osterholm co-authored "The Compelling Need for Game-Changing Influenza Vaccines," which came out last October. It is an exhaustive study of this country's vaccine war on flu.
The authors examined more than 12,000 articles, studies and transcripts dating back to 1936 and interviewed 88 experts on the influenza vaccine.
What they found was that there were some seasons in which the vaccination offers more protection than others, but ultimately, even in good years, the flu shot only offers moderate protection -- a "pooled estimate of 59% for healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, inconsistent evidence of protection in children age 2 to 17 years, and a paucity of evidence for protection in adults 65 years of age and older."
For the nasal spray form of the vaccine, there is evidence of high protection for children aged 6 months to 7 years, inconsistent evidence of protection in adults 60 years of age and older, and a lack of evidence of protection in individuals between 8 and 59 years of age, the study says.
That analysis shows significantly less effectiveness than what has been the conventional wisdom within the scientific community, Osterholm said.
"In promoting vaccination, it became a mantra that it was 70 to 90% effective across all ages completely, and that wasn't true," Osterholm said. Historically, this expansion in policy over who should get vaccinated was based on "professional judgment and not on scientifically sound data," he said.
Had a flu shot? You'll be OK --maybe
Osterholm's study suggests this has been a general pattern in American public health history with relation to the flu vaccine.
"There is a real downside to the promotion (of the current flu vaccine), as it dampens serious investment and shuts down any real interest in start-ups to create a more effective vaccine," Osterholm said. "There is a sense that a 59% match is better than zero, but we wouldn't accept this with a disease like measles, which we seem to take more seriously."
The vaccine, however, is improving, according to Schaffner.
"Researchers are trying to make a genuinely better vaccine, including a universal vaccine that could combat all the different strains of flu that we could get every 10 years, as opposed to needing one annually," Schaffner said.
"So cross your fingers. All of us wish we had a better vaccine. We know what we have is good, but not perfect. Until we have one, we have to do as much good as possible by vaccinating as many people as possible -- and in the meantime I'll be watching the universal vaccine trials very carefully."

Myths about Obamacare
By Aaron Carroll, Special to CNN
updated 12:06 PM EDT, Wed May 29, 2013
A woman receives dental care at a free health clinic in Los Angeles last year.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Aaron Carroll: Obamacare's major changes go into effect in 2014; misconceptions remain
He says polls show many opposed; but 16% of opposed say it's not liberal enough
He says GOP want it to fail; unwilling to even amend, change program Carroll: California exchanges proving less expensive than thought; GOP should take note
Editor's note: Dr. Aaron E. Carroll is an associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the director of the university's Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research. He blogs about health policy at The Incidental Economist and tweets at @aaronecarroll.
(CNN) -- The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was passed into law more than three years ago, but it really doesn't go into effect until next year. That's when the major changes, including the health insurance exchanges ramp up and the Medicaid expansion occurs. Because there has been such a long time between when things started and now, there are plenty of misconceptions about what's happened, what's going on, and what will occur.
For instance, just a month ago, a poll found that 4 in 10 Americans were unsure about whether Obamacare still existed. About a quarter didn't know or didn't answer. An additional 7% thought that the Supreme Court had overturned it last year. Another 12% thought that it had been repealed by Congress and is no longer a law.
Those that still know Obamacare is around remain divided on how they feel about it. A more recent poll from CNN found that only 43% of the public "supports the health care law." This might lead you to think that most of the country wants it repealed. But, as with so many things related to health care reform, there's more than meets the eye here. A full 16% of Americans, about a third of those who "oppose the health care law," do so because it's not liberal enough.
Aaron Carroll
It's important to remember that in many ways Obamacare was a "centrist" solution. Many don't like to hear that, believing that it's socialism-writ-large, but a sizeable chunk of America supported something like Medicare-for-all, a single-payer solution more like what Canadians, or our elderly, enjoy. Many of them still think that's a better choice for health care reform.
In other words, it might be fairer to say that 59% of Americans support a system that is as liberal or more liberal than Obamacare, while 35% don't. That's a much different interpretation than what many are repeating.
Regardless, it's clear that many are still unclear about what's going on with the law or how they feel about it. It's not surprising, therefore, that the Obama administration is gearing up for another big push to sell its brand of reform to the American people.
This is a critical time for the law. For better or worse, the Republican Party, for the most part, stands in total opposition to Obamacare. Many have called the law a "train wreck" waiting to happen, and they believe that letting the law fail, spectacularly, is the quickest way to get rid of that. Because of this, few, if any, opponents of the law are willing to make any concessions or changes to it at all.
This is a relatively new thing when it comes to major legislation. Past laws on this scale, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, and Social Security were amended and changed years and even months after being passed. That's incredibly unlikely to happen with respect to Obamacare.
Moreover, many are doing all they can actively to prevent the law from moving forward. About half of states have refused to partake in the Medicaid expansion, meaning that the majority of the poorest among us will not get Medicaid next year as the law originally planned. Many states are also dragging their feet with respect to the insurance exchanges, hoping that if the federal government fails to get things going in time, Americans will see that the law is unsuccessful. Widespread belief in this might help Republicans increase their electoral power to the point that they can demand repeal.
California ready for health care reform
Fareed's Take: Reform health care
Taking the IRS out of Obamacare This strategy could backfire, though. California, one of the states most thoroughly embracing Obamacare, recently had its rates published for its insurance exchange. The cost of insurance premiums came in significantly below what had been projected. Back in 2009, projections for a "silver" plan for a 40 year old were $5,200-5,400 a year. Last week, though, California announced that the most affordable "silver" plan would cost just over $3,300 a year. That is, of course, the cost without subsidies. For the many Americans who make less than 400% of the poverty line, the cost to them will be even less.
Some will claim that this is still a rate increase for some. That's likely true. There is almost no policy that works out perfectly for everyone. It's likely that some very young, healthy people will spend more on their insurance now for the chance to have it cheaper -- and guaranteed -- later. There are also some who will chafe at having to buy insurance at all.
But the gambit of those opposing Obamacare seems to be a full throated and all-out-effort to show that Obamacare doesn't work. The danger, though, is that it might. The jury is still out, of course. But it's important to recognize that full-out opposition to reform like this is somewhat novel in American politics. No one knows what such a strategy will bring in the long run.
Many thought passing the Affordable Care Act would be President Obama's "Waterloo." It wasn't. In fact, some have argued that the flat out refusal to negotiate in the law's passage cost opponents the chance to get a final product more to their liking. Things are shaping up similarly now. If, a year from now, it appears that exchanges are working out in states that embraced them, and that the Medicaid expansion is succeeding in states that allowed it, then it may turn out that refusing to bend may have instead caused the opposition to break.

(CNN) -- There's a lot of talk about bringing the bottom billion out of poverty and rightly so; this should be the aim of most development initiatives.
But sometimes we have to think outside the box when devising programs to achieve this goal. By strengthening the capacity of civil society and activists, we can amplify the voices of the marginalized and ensure that outcomes improve for society as a whole.
Social tech
Loren Treisman
There's a growing number of social entrepreneurs in Africa, who are utilizing their training and education to develop businesses and initiatives that tackle social challenges. Innovation hubs, incubators and accelerators are supporting entrepreneurs across the continent and are gradually attracting investors and corporate partners.
Spaces supporting tech entrepreneurs, such as the Co-Creation Hub in Nigeria and iHub in Kenya, are at times criticized for being elitist. However, the applications springing up from them are creating jobs as well as beginning to improve the livelihoods of the poor.
iCow, an application that provides timely agricultural information to dairy farmers in Kenya via SMS has reached almost 12,000 farmers and increased their income through elevated milk yields and decreased disease outbreaks.

Passionate voices
Powerful leaders have always been able to amplify messages from the grassroots to effect change, just as Emmeline Pankhurst did for the Suffragettes or as Steve Biko did to help bring down apartheid in South Africa. Moreover, social media enables powerful messages to spread across the world at an incredible rate and despite low internet penetration in Africa, its impact can be dramatic.
In the Bagega community in Nigeria, lead poisoning had resulted in thousands of children suffering serious health problems. The government announced it would release around $5.3 million for remediation but months later the funds had still not reached the affected community.
Two passionate guys formed an organization called Follow the Money and amplified the voices of this forgotten community. They collected testimonies and photographic evidence from the ground and combined these with an infographic showing the government's commitments. Within 48 hours of a Twitter campaign targeting government officials and other influential leaders -- and following a campaign by groups including Human Rights Watch -- the funds were released and affected children are now receiving the urgent medical care that they deserve.

Exposing corruption
Many professionals such as lawyers, journalists, government officials and medical professionals can dramatically impact on the lives of societies' poorest. By equipping them with the right information, tools and know-how, they are better able to defend their rights, expose bad practice and improve public services. In the long term, this will contribute towards poverty reduction.
Journalists have a powerful role to play in exposing corruption, breaking stories and holding governments to account. While only around 15.6% of Africans are online, journalists are able to utilize this information to shine a light on injustices in a country.
Open Corporates, a database containing crucial information on over 60 million companies, enables journalists to expose corporate corruption more efficiently. And as more government data gets released and parliamentary monitoring sites spring up online, they are better able to scrutinize government and spur on citizens to demand improved services.
Astonishingly, across Africa the judiciary, attorneys and the public often struggle to access the laws that govern them.Loren Treisman
Law and order
One only needs to think of the likes of Mahatma Gandhi or Nelson Mandela to see the powerful role that lawyers can have in mobilizing citizens to demand social change. Yet astonishingly, across Africa the judiciary, attorneys and the public often struggle to access the laws that govern them.
The African Legal Information Institute is starting to address this by ensuring that laws are digitized and made freely available. It has been working in partnership with SEYLII in the Seychelles to take this process one step further. Realizing that judges were struggling to gain easy access to critical legal information, they're creating an e-book which will enable legal professionals to read laws on a mobile or tablet even when offline.

Constitutions form the foundation of government, both empowering the institutions that govern a country and ensuring that checks and balances are in place to limit their power. They can spur a country's development and have an impact on outcomes in areas such as human rights protection, democracy and economic growth. With approximately 30 constitutions being amended and five completely replaced each year, it's crucial to get the process right. Nonetheless, constitutional drafters often have limited or no experience in the task at hand.
University College London's Constitute project has digitized the world's constitutions, tagging them in a way that makes it simple for drafters to search and compare specific provisions across countries. This is helping them to make more informed decisions and it's hoped that the tool will help drive increased public participation in the drafting process.
It is hoped that through increasing access to information, strengthening civil society, amplifying the citizen voice and supporting professionals who are providing services to society's poorest, it will result in positive change for society.

A Battle Being Fought
Believe it or not, the military - yes, the military - is reforming
By JOSE MANUEL TESORO Bandung
Senior officers at the military training school Sesko TNI carry the burden of facing mock invasions - and angry public demands for changeTantyo Bangun for Asiaweek
Under cover of night, the enemy sweeps in from the Indian Ocean. One by one the cities of Sumatra fall. A foreign army is now encamped beside Banda Aceh's black-domed Baiturrahman Mosque; hostile troops patrol the emptied streets of Medan and Pekanbaru. West Sumatra's capital of Padang, leveled after a doomed resistance, still smolders. Besieged and encircled, Palembang cannot hold out for much longer. Meanwhile, West Java's key Siliwangi division, the Army Strategic Command's two infantry divisions, Special Forces commandos, the navy's Western Fleet and 17 air squadrons at Jakarta's Halim Airbase are all awaiting orders. Yours.
The wrong response to present to one's instructors would be fear, panic and utter confusion. Especially since those challenged with this invasion - actually a four-day regular exercise dubbed Operation War Game, held at the Indonesian military's Staff and Command College - will one day occupy command positions in the nation's armed forces. All candidates for senior jobs in the Indonesian defense hierarchy must undergo a seven-month course at the college's spare campus in the cool West Java city of Bandung. The minimum rank for admission is senior lieutenant-colonel. The minimum age is 47.

The aim of the 25-year-old institution, known in Indonesian as Sesko TNI, is to smooth cooperation on matters of strategy and military science among leaders of the army, navy, air force and, until recently, police. But as the final tier of training and the main think-tank for top military personnel, Sesko TNI is leading the redirection of Indonesia's most influential organization. Even as civilians attack the military for obstructing change and spreading violence, reform has actually been quietly at work.
"We have to acknowledge there have been mistakes," says Col. D.E. Nadapdap, a Sesko TNI instructor. One major problem: the doctrine of dwifungsi ("dual function"). By declaring that the military had both a defense and a social-political role, the armed forces elevated involvement in day-to-day politics to the same plane as maintaining a professional military. In time, the former grew at the expense of the latter. Many military men built up significant interests in both business and politics, especially in the bureaucracy and local government, which, as a result of dwifungsi, at one point reportedly had about 21,000 officers in civilian positions.
Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto is under renewed fire for the army's human-rights abuses, especially in East Timor and Aceh. Yet, under him, the military has committed itself to becoming more professional. Says Lt.-Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, one of Wiranto's top aides: "Reform will continue until the military is in a proper position to perform its main task of defense and security." Some of Wiranto's measures have been largely symbolic, such as changing the acronym by which most Indonesians refer to the military from the Suharto-tainted ABRI (Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia) to the original, Independence-era TNI (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, or Indonesian National Military). Other moves are more concrete. Last November, after protests and public pressure, the military gave in to a cut in the number of military representatives in the national parliament from 75 to 38 seats, and in local parliaments from 20% to 10%. Wiranto has even suggested that the military faction may not exist by the next parliamentary election, in 2004. In April, the armed forces chief separated the police force from the military. Most significantly, he delivered an ultimatum to the 3,000 soldiers who now serve as both officers and public officials: either retire from the military or resign from the bureaucracy. Most chose to take their pension papers.
In a move unthinkable not too long ago, the military has even surrendered its troublesome social-political function, at least formally. Wiranto abolished the military headquarters' socio-political department, formerly headed by Yudhoyono. Now, the TNI says it has a single function: the maintenance of national security. At Sesko TNI, senior soldiers no longer take units on the military's social-political function, but instead discuss "social communication." There are even seminars on public relations and on human rights.
Reforms could be coming at just the right time for the military. Two young academics, Douglas Kammen and Siddharth Chandra, oppose the established perception of the Indonesian military as driven by personal or religious alignments. In their recently published book A Tour of Duty, they argue that little-examined internal organizational pressures have a great influence on military politics. During the 1960s, the military academy graduated a huge number of cadets - the same soldiers who are now among the military's seniors. That explosion in the number of soldiers expecting positions, they say, is why officers have been rotated through commands so rapidly in the 1990s, and one reason why jobs in the bureaucracy have been so key for the military for so long. But after 1975, the number of cadets dropped and has now stabilized at about 250 a year. With less competition for posts, explains Kammen in an interview, there could be increased respect for professionalism. He says: "There's reason to believe that many of these officers have an interest in keeping a clean record and avoiding flagrant human rights abuses."
Retired general Hasnan Habib detects among the younger crop of senior officers an enthusiasm to make the army more professional. The problem is that there is no money. In the latest government budget, 2.3% of expenditures went to the defense sector, or about $143 million. That means that someone like Special Forces Capt. Andiyanto, after 20 years of service, makes about $80 a month from salary, bonus and food allowance. "How can we be as professional as we should be," he asks, "when we are underfed like this?" Corruption is almost inevitable. Habib worries that chronic underfunding will frustrate efforts at modernization - and disillusion even those officers keenly seeking change. It will also be tough to remove politics from the profession, especially since, in the past, promotions to the highest positions were often decided on political connections. The requirement that all senior commanders attend Sesko TNI was routinely disregarded. Lt.-Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a Suharto son-in-law, had commanded the Special Forces and the Army Strategic Command but never attended Sesko TNI. Neither did Wiranto, a former Suharto adjutant. The military now promises that the regulation will be strictly adhered to.
A clean and merit-based military, focused on its readiness to defend the country - the TNI has a way to go before it gets there. More money would help, but the public mood prevents loosening the purse strings for the military. At least it has begun the journey. The result may not be visible for years, even decades. Meanwhile, the image of the armed forces continues to plummet among many Indonesians. "They don't want to see us anymore," says a Sesko TNI colonel sadly. The re-training of Indonesia's military is not just a result of political necessity or generational change. It is also a matter of honor.
