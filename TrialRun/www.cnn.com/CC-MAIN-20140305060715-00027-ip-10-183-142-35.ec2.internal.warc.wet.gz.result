Thriving African tourism backed by private investmentsStory Highlights Moroccan private sector to play prominent role in developing tourism The country's potential was proven by large number of MTM attendees Event was supported by King Mohammed VI and organized by Rahal Group Morocco has been dubbed the new DubaiNext Article in World » By Sylvia Smith for CNN	MARRAKECH, Morocco -- The North African country with the fastest growth rate in tourism sent out a clear message that its own private sector will now play a more prominent role in developing its all-important travel industry, indicating that it is ready to use expertise acquired over several decades of steady growth to spearhead new initiatives that would put a large number of unknown sub-Saharan countries on the map. Traditional dancers entertain MTM attendants, in efforts to drum up interest in the region. Supported by Morocco's King Mohammed VI and inaugurated by the newly appointed Minister of Tourism, the Moroccan Travel Market (MTM) was organized by the Rahal Group, one of the country's most respected firms with interests in the entertainment and catering industries, as well as a budding interest in tourism. A first for the MTM, confidence in the country's potential was underlined both by the number of those exhibiting at the event and further stressed by the thousands of enthusiastic travel agents, tour operators and international investors, the latter being partially responsible for the huge increase in tourist-related construction. While the Moroccan tourism sector does welcome a massive increase in foreign investment, this private initiative showcasing the diversity of its wares was undoubtedly intended to stake out its territory. MTM President Abdel Karim Rahal referred to the event's success as a result of both Morocco's own natural resources and a greater global perspective. "We have a wide variety of terrain from mountains, forests and deserts to beaches and modern cities," he explained. "We can offer hunting, fishing and eco-tourism as well as the more traditional beach holiday or cultural visits." Rahal went on to lay out a vision for the future of pan-continental African tourism that would benefit from a network of interlinked groups. Each would have its own tourist destinations while still offering the proximity to its neighbor's marvels. "We here in Morocco have shown that it is possible to achieve high visitor numbers. By making a north-south bridge we believe that tourists from Europe will discover virtually unknown areas of Africa," he said. Rahal also stressed that King Mohammed VI was taking a keen personal interest in tourism-related developments and that all major decisions were made at the level of the palace. This new Maghrebi perspective was apparent from the series of big white tents housing the exhibition center evoking the sense of north Africa. The main entrance was lined with scores of chanting and drumming traditional musicians and the glistening points of the tents echoed the snowy Atlas mountain peaks in the background. Regardless, it is inside where the MTM revealed the international nature of its tourism sector by offering more than 250 exhibition stands ranging from Moroccan spas and specialist trekking organizations to exhibitors from Cameroon, Madagascar and Mauritania. It is hoped that the MTM will stimulate a more coordinated approach to tourism among Morocco's neighboring states to the south. Don't Miss Inside Africa looks inside the Congo and Kenya
With India also exhibiting many of its colorful and appreciated holiday destinations, Marrakech remained the focus of the event. Investors pointed out that the main holiday property market moved outside the city, along roads leading to the mountains or away to the coast. Developers there build either detached riads in their own grounds or big Moroccan-style villas, houses and apartments on large complexes, usually focusing on a golf course. Two years ago, the Association of British Travel Agents recognized the growing importance of the region by holding its annual convention in Marrakech. Alarmed by the drop in their own tourism market, the Spanish attended the MTM in droves, keen to invest and conduct business. Stung by the fall-out from money-laundering mayors, land-grabbing developers and coastal over-pricing and over-supply, Spain is suffering from having its confidence dented and its property market brought to a near standstill. Prices on the Iberian peninsula generally are rising by five percent, only just above the rate of inflation. With April's stock market correction and now rumors of coastal demolition, the impression given is that Spain is in a negative loop. Moroccan prices rose by 15 to 20 percent last year and the tourism push is also seeing secondary cities like Fez and Tangier benefiting from both large corporate investment and fledgling foreign individual interest. The contraction in its neighbor's market contrasts starkly with the building explosion being encouraged by King Mohammed VI, who decided some years back that tourism was the future for his kingdom. Aiming to increase visitor numbers to 10 million by 2010, he has been establishing development incentives along Morocco's impressive Atlantic coastline, as well as inland. This ambition has been boosted by the European Open Skies policy that has seen low-cost flight operators opening new routes into the country. Currently Marrakech airport is being extended to cope with this new influx. Morocco has already been dubbed the new Dubai and developers from the United Arab Emirates have recently committed to long term, billion-dollar investments that would bring luxurious lifestyle resorts in and around Morocco's most popular destination. Nevertheless, Marrakech's market is underpinned by domestic demand from wealthy Moroccans in Casablanca and Rabat searching for weekend homes, and not solely reliant on tourists, as the coastal resorts are. Developments around Marrakech are top end, aimed at a sophisticated buyer who is happy to abandon being a pebble throw from a beach for centuries of history, color and the choice of golf, skiing in the Atlas mountains or meandering round the souk. Inevitably showcase seminars presented at the MTM considered the need to balance economic growth with environmental protection. Several key speakers voiced concern over sustainable development and the impact of such a huge amount of construction, while questioning whether it could be sustained without having a negative impact on water supply and global warming. However according to one British tour operator visiting the MTM, the exhibition enhanced the notion of travel to distant cultures as a highly creative pursuit. "You won't find the mundane, trivial or amateurish here," he said. "This steers us away completely from the idea that it is foreigners who are running the country's tourism industry." It seems that the timing was just right for the MTM. With South Africa's Indaba Travel Market concentrating solely on southern Africa and another of Africa's premier destinations, Kenya, overwhelmed by tribal conflict, Morocco appeared on the international scene at just the right moment. With some of the sharpest architectural designs for new tourist complexes on display, the exhibition was a forceful reminder that the number of foreign tourists who visited Morocco last year topped 8 million, reflecting the reality of achieving the aim of 10 million visitors by 2010. It also seems that The Moroccan Travel Market will become the most influential travel market in Africa and that neighboring countries will share the benefits. E-mail to a friend All About Morocco

Panetta to Karzai: Thank U.S. for sacrifices rather than criticize
By Amir Ahmed and Chelsea J. Carter, CNN
updated 11:34 AM EDT, Sat October 6, 2012
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has criticized the Afghan president.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says Afghan progress is due to U.S. sacrifices Panetta says Hamid Karzai should express "his thanks for the sacrifices"
Karzai drew the ire of Panetta with complaints about the U.S. fight on terror
The United States is not doing enough to fight terror in Pakistan, Karzai says (CNN) -- The U.S. defense chief called on President Hamid Karzai to thank Americans for the sacrifices of those who fought and died in Afghanistan rather than level criticism at the United States.
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's comments Friday followed accusations by Karzai that the United States is not doing enough to fight terror in neighboring Pakistan.
Karzai also said the United States is failing to supply Afghan forces with weapons it needs to fight insurgents.
"Look, we have made progress in Afghanistan because there are men and women in uniform who have been willing to fight and die for Afghanistan's sovereignty," Panetta told reporters shortly after landing in Lima, Peru, for a meeting with Latin American defense officials.
Latest Afghan attack: A troubling first?
"Those lives were lost fighting the right enemy not the wrong enemy, and I think it would be helpful if the president, every once in a while, expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan, rather than criticizing them."
The sharp reaction from Panetta, a rare public dressing down of the head of a country, came a day after Karzai accused the United States and NATO of attacking insurgents in Afghanistan rather than targeting the support they receive from Pakistan.
"The U.S. and NATO should go to the places where the roots of terrorism exist. They are saying one thing but acting contrary to that," Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul, according to CNN affiliate Tolo TV.
Karzai also threatened to turn to Russia and China among others if the United States did not supply Afghanistan with equipment needed to fight the insurgency.
"I asked the U.S. government to equip our air force with weapons, intelligence and transport planes -- we still haven't received a response from them," he said. "Our discussions will continue next week as well, and if they show no interest in this, we will decide whether to purchase from Russia, China, India or any other country."
5 ways to help fix Afghanistan
Karzai's criticism of the United States come as relations between Kabul and Washington have steadily eroded in recent months, pushed in part by the accidental killing of civilians and the U.S. military's refusal to surrender a number of prisoners to Afghan control.
Tensions have been further exacerbated by attacks against coalition troops by Afghan troops or insurgents disguised in security uniforms that have left dozens dead.
The timing of Karzai's criticism comes as the United States surpassed a military casualty milestone last month, with more than 2,000 U.S. troops killed in the 11-year war.
Karzai laid some of the blame on the United States for the shelling of Afghanistan's eastern border provinces by insurgents inside Pakistan, saying his forces were not sufficiently equipped to respond and the United States should have stepped up.
"According to the Afghan-U.S. strategic pact, the U.S. is committed to defend Afghanistan against any such foreign threat until the Afghan forces find the ability," he said. "We asked them several time but they never accepted that these attacks were occurring."
Panetta said the United States remains committed to timetable to withdraw American combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

An asteroid is coming, and scientists are excited. Fear not, Earth is safe
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 7:53 AM EST, Tue February 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
It's going to be the closest shave in known history, NASA expert says
Asteroid 2012 DA14 is traveling at 17,400 mph
Star gazers will likely turn out for a peek in Eastern Europe, Asia and Australia
Asteroids may be mined in space for their natural resources some day
(CNN) -- Look out for Asteroid 2012 DA14.
It is heading toward Earth at 17,450 miles per hour, according to NASA, and the tug of our planet's gravitational field will cause it to accelerate when it gets here.
But it's not going to strike us, when it passes by on February 15. NASA is adamant about this.
"Its orbit is very well-known," said Dr. Don Yeomans, NASA specialist for near-Earth objects. "We know exactly where it's going to go, and it cannot hit the Earth."
But it will give the Blue Planet the closest shave by any object its size in known history, Yeomans said. Gravity will cause it to fly a curved path, tugging it closer to Earth's surface than most GPS or television satellites.
Asteroid to fly between Earth, moon
The Number: Hazardous asteroids
While the asteroid is moving at a good clip, space rockets have to accelerate to an even higher speed to escape Earth's gravity and make it into space. Though 2012 DA14 will be flying more slowly, its trajectory will keep it from falling to Earth.
Getting a look at 2012 DA14
Star gazers in Eastern Europe, Asia or Australia might be able to see it with binoculars or consumer telescopes. It will not be visible to the naked eye, because it's small, "about half the size of a football field," Yeomans said.
There are millions of asteroids in our solar system, and they come in all dimensions -- from the size of a beach ball to a large mountain, NASA said.
Researchers are looking forward to getting such a close look at an asteroid, as it flies from south to north past Earth, coming as close as 17,200 miles to our planet's surface. NASA will ping it with a signal from a satellite dish for a few days to get a better idea of its makeup.
Astronomers think there are about half a million asteroids the size this one near Earth, NASA said, but less than one percent have been detected.
Twenty years ago, no one would likely have discovered 2012 DA14, Yeomans said. Scientists spotted it nearly a year ago from an observatory in the south of Spain. Today, specialists track asteroids' paths 100 years into future.
They do so less to assess any possible threat of impact with Earth and more to explore what opportunities they offer. "These objects are important for science. They're important for our future resources," Yeomans said.
Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet
Asteroids are potential gold mines
Asteroids can be chock full of metals and other materials, which could be mined for use on earth or on space stations. NASA has discussed the possibility of capturing near-Earth asteroids and placing them into Earth's orbit to study them and extract their resources.
At least two start-up companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, plan to mine asteroids and sell the acquired bounty on Earth and in space.
Being able to exploit asteroids' resources would allow humans to fly farther out into the solar system, build stations a long way from Earth and supply them with materials gathered out in space.
Some asteroids, for example, are made of ice, NASA said, which could be used as drinking water for a distant space platform.
What if one like this did hit us?
An asteroid this size passes this close to Earth only every 40 years and collides with it only once every 1,200 years.
If NASA turns out to be wrong about this one not hitting the planet -- and they won't be -- then Asteroid 2012 DA14 would not destroy the world in any case, Yeomans said.
An asteroid made of metal that was about the same size collided with Earth 50,000 years ago, creating the mile wide "Meteor Crater" in Arizona and obliterating everything for 50 miles around, he said.
2012 DA14 is likely made of stone, which would do much less damage.
In 1908 a similar type asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded over Tunguska, Russia, leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two thirds the size of Rhode Island.
Not Earth shattering, but you still wouldn't want to live nearby.

4 ways to control your health care costs
By Jacque Wilson, CNN
updated 9:04 AM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
Telling your doctor up front that you're concerned about price can help open the door to savings, experts say.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
$3,200 was the average out-of-pocket health care cost for a family of four in 2011
Expert: People frequently overpay for services because they don't do research
The best way to lower health care costs can be summed up in two words: Just ask
Editor's note: When we debate health care policy, we seem to jump right to the issue of who should pay the bills. This week's TIME cover story asks another question: Why exactly are the bills so high in the first place? Bitter pill: Why medical bills are killing us
(CNN) -- The health care debate is full of numbers: 48.6 million uninsured Americans; $2.6 trillion spent on health care annually; family premiums that have increased 97% over the past decade.
But those numbers are abstract and hold little meaning for Americans struggling to pay their medical bills.
Perhaps a more accurate number is $3,200: the average out-of-pocket health care cost for a family of four in 2011. Or $815 -- the typical cost of an abdominal MRI in Chicago. Or $24,431 -- the hospital fee for having a pacemaker inserted in San Diego.
Those are the numbers that can leave you feeling helpless.
When you're ill, the last thing you should do is turn down care. Instead, learn to take charge of your health care costs to prevent your medical bill from making you even sicker.
TIME: Why medical bills are killing us
Family fights $474K hospital bill
See why health care costs so much
CNN Explains: Health care reform
"(People) frequently overpay for services just because they don't know that there's price variation -- that you can get the exact same care at a different facility across the street for a fraction of the cost," says Dr. Jeffrey Rice, founder of HealthCareBlueBook.com, a free price comparison website for patients.
Bitter pill: Why medical bills are killing us
Rice often tells the story of his son, who needed outpatient foot surgery. Rice was initially quoted $37,000 for the procedure. His total after insurance and discounts would be around $20,000, the doctor told him. So Rice asked if there was another facility where they could get the procedure.
His new total? $1,500 for a happy and healthy son.
"If there was a gas station that said $20 a gallon, you would not go there, correct?" Rice asks. "But in health care, that's how bad it is. There are people who pay five times too much for their health care every day."
Just ask
The best way to lower your health care costs can be summed up in two words: Just ask.
Tell your doctor up front that you're concerned about price, Rice says, and ask them to help you save money. Ask how much the procedure is going to cost. Ask if the test they've ordered is necessary or if you can wait a week to see if the condition heals on its own. Ask if there's a cheaper alternative or generic version of the medication they've prescribed.
"Those are fair questions to ask your doctor," Rice says. "Many times, the doctors know ways to give you perfectly good care without running up large health care bills."
iReport: Tell us your health care story
Another important question to ask is whether the doctor or facility is in your insurance network, says Karen Pollitz, an expert in private insurance with the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.
Going outside of your insurance company's preferred network of caregivers can double your out-of-pocket costs. Most companies have a website or number where patients can call to check, but you should also call the doctor or hospital to confirm, Pollitz says.
Patients should also feel free to ask about payment plans for larger bills. Medical providers usually offer lower interest rates than a credit card company. And nonprofit hospitals are mandated by law to have financial relief programs for the uninsured and underinsured. Many hospitals and doctors' offices will also waive a portion of the bill if you pay in cash.
"Always ask," Pollitz stresses. "The worst it can be is a waste of time."
Befriend your local pharmacist
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, pharmacists are now encouraged to slow down and talk to clients, says Ernest Boyd, executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association.
Called "medication therapy management," this section of Medicare Part D helps pharmacists focus on the patients they serve instead of just filling bottles at a rapid rate. Take advantage by chatting up your pharmacist on a regular basis.
Think about it, Boyd says: "What other health professional do you have available to walk up to and talk to for free who has a six-year doctorate degree?"
Patients often have multiple doctors and specialists they're seeing, with medications from each. This can lead to complications, duplications and drugs that are added solely to treat the side effects of other drugs, Boyd says.
A pharmacist can look at the larger picture if you arrange a "brown bag review," he says. Bring all the drugs you're taking (prescription, over-the-counter and natural remedies) in to the pharmacy and have a pharmacist go over them one by one.
For example, one elderly patient was taking 14 drugs prescribed by multiple doctors for various ailments. Boyd cut that down to eight, saving her more than $1,200 in co-payments without altering her treatment.
At the very least, your pharmacist should be able to recommend a generic or alternative medication for the one you're taking at a much cheaper price.
"The physician knows the diagnosis; the pharmacist knows the drugs," Boyd says simply.
Do your research
Most people would rather do their taxes than read their health care insurance plan, Pollitz says. "It's just icky. I think that's the technical term."
But understanding your plan -- such as knowing your deductible or any co-pays for which you're responsible -- will help you prepare for upcoming expenses.
Some larger companies offer benefits counselors who can help guide you through the fine print, Pollitz says. If one is not available, HealthCare.gov offers definitions of basic terms, compares your options (HSA or FSA? PPO or HMO?) and explains the rights/protections given to you under the Affordable Care Act.
There are also several websites that can help you lower your health care costs by letting you know what you should be paying.
Searching for Medicaid or Medicare options, or the right individual health insurance plan? HealthPocket.com rates insurance companies based on government, nonprofit and commercial data sources to show you all your options.
Rice's Healthcare Blue Book basically offers blue book prices for medical procedures -- like the "Kelly Blue Book" value for a car that you go into the dealership with to negotiate.
Type your ZIP code into HealthcareBlueBook.com and select the medical procedure or test you need. The site will then return the "fair" price for that test in your area.
GoodRx.com offers a similar service for prescription medications. Consumer Reports picked it as the best app for finding the lowest drug prices in store and online. The site also shows generic alternatives (if there are any) and posts coupons to help you save.
Fight back
If in the end, your bill still ends up being more than you expected to pay, don't be afraid to fight back, Pollitz says.
"People are inclined to take 'No' for an answer," she says. "You can always complain. You can always appeal."
Through the ACA, states are starting Consumer Assistance Programs that are designed to empower patients. One of the jobs they're required to do is help you file an insurance claim, Pollitz says.
If the insurance company denies the appeal (which they usually do, Pollitz says), you have the right to take it to an outside reviewer. Those who do, Pollitz says, win about half the time.
Visit HealthCare.gov or your state's labor department for more.

Justice Dept. 'peacekeepers' worked 'Trayvon' rallies, group claims
By Joe Johns, CNN
updated 11:38 AM EDT, Thu July 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Justice Department unit worked rallies over Trayvon Martin shooting, Judicial Watch says
The Community Relations Service sent a "secret team" or "peacekeepers" to Florida, group says
CRS long associated with efforts to mediate and difuse tense situations in communities
Man accused of shooting Martin in 2012, George Zimmerman, on trial in Florida
Washington (CNN) -- A government agency long associated with efforts to mediate and diffuse tense situations in communities helped organize rallies over the killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin last year, a conservative leaning legal advocacy group claims.
Judicial Watch circulated a press release and accompanying documents on Wednesday asserting that the Community Relations Service, a division of the Justice Department, sent a "secret team" of "peacekeepers" to Sanford, Florida, last March and April to work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the explosive case that is now the subject of a murder trial.
Timeline of early events in Trayvon Martin case
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. It instead pointed CNN to the 45-year record of CRS, which was created by a provision included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Ex-police chief: I upheld my oath
Ex-police chief: I upheld my oath
Attorney: Martin family wants justice
The CRS website describes itself as "the only federal agency dedicated to assist state and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony."
CRS conciliators are frequently seen at large marches and rallies, and have been present at countless protests, including those that occur every four years at the Democratic and Republican political conventions.
Conservative groups have complained that the conciliators are secretive and do not talk to the media.
Ex-Sanford police chief: Zimmerman probe 'taken away from us'
The service maintains that it does not choose sides and "uses impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures to help local leaders resolve problems and restore stability."
Zimmerman, 29, is accused of second-degree murder in the February 26, 2012, death of Martin, 17.
Defense attorneys argue Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense after the Miami teenager charged him. Prosecutors argue he followed Martin through his neighborhood and shot him without provocation.
Martin supporters argued Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, took advantage of what they considered loose Florida gun laws to racially profile and shoot an unarmed African-American teenager without provocation.
The incident, inflamed by a lengthy delay before charges were filed against Zimmerman, provoked protests nationwide.
Opinion: What about Martin's right to 'stand his ground'?

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Author Carrie Goldman moderated the first anti-bullying panel at San Diego Comic-Con
Goldman: "Even within geek culture, there is still a vast amount of peer victimization"
More pop culture cons need to start conversations about bullying, Goldman says
"There is space for fun and games as well as tackling the more serious issues," she says
Editor's note: Carrie Goldman is the author of "Bullied: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of Fear." Follow Carrie on Facebook and Twitter.
(CNN) -- I can pinpoint the exact moment that put me on a path to moderate San Diego Comic-Con's first anti-bullying panel last weekend. It happened 32 months ago, when I published a blog post about my first-grade daughter Katie, who was taunted for carrying a "Star Wars" water bottle and backpack.
It was the post that launched a thousand geeks, and then 5,000 tweets. Over the next weeks and months, I read a near-constant stream of e-mails, letters and messages from people around the world who wanted to share their own stories of bullying and peer victimization. The story touched the collective nerve of a very motivated and tech-savvy group of people, who took my daughter in as one of their own. My husband and I like to say that we were the first ones to adopt Katie, and the self-proclaimed geeks and nerds adopted her six years later.
The kindness of strangers to our family served as the catalyst for my transition to full-time work as an anti-bullying advocate. After interviewing hundreds of people, including parents, teachers, kids, bullies, victims, bystanders, researchers, psychologists, lawmakers, celebrities and social workers, I wrote a book about why bullying persists in our culture and how we can end the cycle of fear.
Carrie Goldman, center, moderated an anti-bullying panel at San Diego Comic-Con.
But even within geek culture, there is still a vast amount of peer victimization, harassment and bullying. The gaming industry has been plagued by a hotbed of vicious attacks -- male gamers versus female gamers and hardcore gamers versus casual gamers, with issues of misogyny and homophobia and discrimination coming to the forefront of our collective consciousness. Within cosplay, people attack each other over myriad issues: Is the costume authentic? Does the person have the right body shape or ethnicity for the chosen costume?
The roles of bullies and victims can sometimes be blurry, especially when someone who was bullied as a child grows up to be the aggressor. In a world that likes to simplify goodies versus baddies, bullying dynamics are not always so simple to deconstruct.
Comic-Con is widely revered as the mecca of pop culture conventions, but it had never hosted a conversation directly about bullying. Just as parents, kids and communities are talking about social cruelty in schools and online, I wanted to keep the discussion going among geeks and nerds. We need an opportunity to reach the content creators and ask: How can we respond to messages of bullying perpetuated by entertainment media while retaining dynamic narratives in music, movies, video games and comics?
Stay in touch!
Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.
Two years ago at the first GeekGirlCon, I met Chase Masterson, who played Leeta during the final five seasons of "Star Trek: Deep Space 9." Masterson has mentored kids in gangs for many years, and she views bullying prevention as a passion project. "There's strength in the knowledge that countless bullied kids, who have felt so hopeless, have overcome that pain and have rich, fulfilling lives and relationships. And people who have been bullied have a unique ability to become compassionate voices, leaders and champions over oppression; the potential for healing to conquer injustice is huge," she explained.
A bite-size tour of Comic-Con
At Comic-Con, Masterson and I debuted the newly formed Anti-Bullying Coalition to lead conversations about a wide range of bullying issues. How can we get society to stop blaming the victim? How can we create safer spaces for GLBT kids? How do we empower kids to speak up for others who are being victimized? How do we raise children who are neither bullies nor victims?
The questions flew back and forth, bandied about by Coalition members such as No H8 Campaign, the United Nations Association, Cartoon Network's Stop Bullying: Speak Up, the Anti-Defamation League and GLSEN. At one point I stood back and looked around, equal parts grateful and amazed to be part of the discussion. Surrounded by people in elaborate costumes, listening to the noise and excitement, I recalled the moment 32 months ago when I was just another worried mom, wondering how to help my kid. That moment led me here.
Comic-Con: Jennifer Lawrence
Comic-Con is serving as a model for other conventions by addressing the issue of bullying. There is space for fun and games as well as tackling the more serious issues that affect convention-goers. Comic conventions provide a common forum for those with passionate -- even obsessive -- interests, and the same people who were once taunted for dressing as Superman in school are now celebrated as cosplayers at a con.
Comic-Con: Stan Lee
Indeed, some of the strongest voices of support for Katie came from the 501st Legion, an international charitable organization dedicated to creating exact costume replications of characters from Star Wars. When Katie mentioned that she would like to be a Stormtrooper for Halloween last year, the 501st Legion put out a call to action, and members worldwide donated parts for a miniature set of armor. The Midwest Garrison assembled the costume and presented it to Katie in a ceremony that ended with her hugging Darth Vader. After Katie outgrows the armor, we'll donate it back to the 501st so it can be passed to another child, most likely through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Katie, who is off at sleep-away camp, was unable to attend Comic-Con. But she was with me every step of the way.
Late Sunday afternoon, in the final hour of the final day of the con, the first-ever anti-bullying panel took place. From the moment I posed the first question to writer Jane Espenson of "Once Upon a Time" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," to the very last comments by Masterson, the room was full. Every person stayed. Within hours of the panel ending, tweets were already coming in from people asking us to bring anti-bullying panels to other pop culture conventions. Leaders in the geek community are spreading the word.
I think back to the first moments of the panel, when I said to the room, "Raise your hand if you still remember a specific incidence of being taunted from more than a decade ago." The sheer number of hands in the air served as testimony to the power of hurt feelings to linger. From now on, Comic-Con convention-goers will come for cosplay, entertainment, freebies, autographs -- and healing.

3 issues that have chilled U.S.-Russia ties
By Michael Martinez, CNN
updated 10:23 AM EDT, Fri September 6, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Presidents Obama and Putin have been at odds all year Russia angered Obama when it gave temporary asylum to Edward Snowden
Putin signed an anti-gay propaganda law that offended Obama
Obama asserts Syria uses chemical weapons, but Putin wants proof
(CNN) -- The summer-long antagonism between the United States and Russia enters a new phase this week as the presidents of both countries participate in the Group of 20 nations summit.
Will discord continue? Or will some concord emerge? Although U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin have no formal meetings scheduled, they likely will have opportunities to chat in Russia, which is hosting the gathering.
To say the two countries have been at odds this year is putting it mildly.
Edward Snowden: fugitive or refugee?
The Obama administration made former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden perhaps the most wanted man in the world. Snowden faces espionage charges after he admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs.
Obama, Putin and their body language Are Obama and Putin 'frenemies'?
Why Russia is sticking by Syria
Obama and Putin: They're just different
The U.S.-Russia relationship became strained when Snowden was revealed to be hiding in a Moscow airport, where the Russian government allowed him to hole up in a transit zone for weeks.
Putin declined to hand Snowden over to the United States and declared Snowden a "free man" biding time in the airport.
After Snowden inquired about asylum in Latin American countries, Russia stunned Obama: it decided to grant temporary asylum to Snowden.
Angered, Obama threatened to skip this week's G20 summit in St. Petersburg. He obviously changed his mind: Obama and Putin shook hands and exchanged words briefly during the summit's opening Thursday.
It was a polite -- perhaps a tad forced -- moment, and it went no further than that.
Gay rights
Obama has often been referred to as America's first "gay president" because of his aggressive advocacy of gay rights and same-sex marriage.
Putin, however, signed a propaganda law passed by parliament that bans the public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported.
Critics say the law is so vague that someone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow T-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex.
Obama declared "nobody's more offended than me" by the Russian law.
Syria: Is chemical warfare for real?
The backdrop to the G20 economic summit is Obama's international campaign to begin limited bombing of Syria for the regime's alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people in a civil war.
Putin hasn't been quick to embrace U.S. assertions that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is using chemical weapons. Putin wants high proof that Assad -- an ally of Russia -- has indeed engaged in such warfare.
Putin called the chemical weapon allegations "absurd" because he said the Assad regime holds the upper hand over rebels.
The skepticism is powerful because Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and, if the United States and its allies seek U.N. approval to bomb Syria, Russia can veto such a resolution. Russia has invoked that power repeatedly the past two years.
On Wednesday, the eve of the G20 summit, Putin said he "doesn't exclude" supporting a U.N. resolution for military force against Syria -- but only if there's irrefutable proof of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government.
What's one to make of all this?
Look to history, one analyst said.
"I think Putin especially sees himself as a Cold War guy," said Julia Ioffe, senior editor of the New Republic, who was a Moscow correspondent for Foreign Policy. "He's not shed that mentality. He sees himself as a foil and counterweight to America and the world."
