Ayers and Obama crossed paths on boards, records showStory Highlights William Ayers was a fugitive leader of an anti-Vietnam war terrorist group The 60s radical group committed its acts when Obama was a child Ayers and Obama later worked on Chicago charitable boards together Obama's spokesperson said Obama had been unaware of Ayers' past Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston CNN Special Investigations Unit CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- More than 30 years ago, William Ayers was a fugitive leader of the Weather Underground, an antiwar terrorist group known for its bombings of police stations, the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol. Chicago gave William Ayers its Citizen of the Year award in 1997 for his work on an education project. Today, he is back in the news, a central figure in a debate over character, judgment and associations in an increasingly bitter presidential race between Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain. At issue is Obama's relationship with Ayers, an unrepentant radical who as late as 2001 said he wished he had done more to stop the Vietnam War. After years on the run, the federal government's case against Ayers and his wife, fellow radical Bernadine Dohrn, was thrown out due to illegal wiretaps and prosecutorial misconduct. CNN's attempts to contact Ayers for comment were unsuccessful. Ayers is now a university professor who lives on the South Side of Chicago, where Obama cut his political teeth. The nature of their relationship has been the subject of discussion all year in the blogosphere, but was dismissed by Obama during a Democratic primary debate earlier this year. Obama confirmed during that April debate that he knew Ayers "as a guy who lives in my neighborhood." When pressed, Obama said they served on a charitable board together. He also denounced Ayers' support for violence. "What they are arguing is that somehow the fact that these two people, who both served as educational reformers in Chicago, both who did have their paths cross professionally as well as neighbors occasionally, that somehow this association is a problem because of Bill Ayers' past and things that happened in the 1960s when Barack Obama was 7 years old," said Anita Dunn, a senior Obama adviser. "And that's just wrong and quite unfair." But the relationship between Obama and Ayers went deeper, ran longer and was more political than Obama -- and his surrogates -- have revealed, documents and interviews show.

Fact Check: Is Obama 'palling around with terrorists'?
A review of board minutes and records by CNN show Obama crossed paths repeatedly with Ayers at board meetings of the Annenberg Challenge Project. The Annenberg Foundation gave the project a $50 million grant to match local private funds to improve schools, and Ayers fought to bring the grant to Chicago, according to participants and project records. The project's organizing committee asked Obama to serve as the board chairman in 1995. Annenberg Project Executive Director Ken Rollings said Ayers was not a member of that ad hoc group when the decision was made. For seven years, Ayers and Obama -- among many others -- worked on funding for education projects, including some projects advocated by Ayers. "The specific job of the board of directors was to give out the money," said Stanley Kurtz, a conservative researcher for the Ethics and Public Policy Center and frequent Obama critic. "Instead of giving money directly to schools, they gave money to what they call external partners and these partners were often pretty radical community organizer groups," said Kurtz, who also has been reviewing the Annenberg Challenge's recently released records. The board, for example, gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bill Ayers' small schools project. The project promoted alternative education, including projects like the Peace School -- where the curriculum centered on a United Nations theme -- and another school where the focus was African-American studies. The funding, according to Kurtz and records CNN reviewed, came directly from the Annenberg foundation which Obama chaired. The project shut down in 2003 after achieving "little impact on school improvement and student outcomes," its final report stated. While working on the Annenberg project, Obama and Ayers also served together on a second charitable foundation, the Woods Fund. It was that foundation that Obama referenced in the debate -- not the Annenberg Challenge. Among Wood Foundation recipients were the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's Trinity United Church, where Obama attended and was married; and the Children and Family Justice Center, where Ayers' wife Dohrn was director. A CNN review of project records found nothing to suggest anything inappropriate in the volunteer projects in which the two men were involved. Read CNN's fact check on Obama's connection to Ayers Ayers has strong defenders in Chicago -- including Mayor Richard Daley, who called him "a valued member of the Chicago community." The city gave Ayers its Citizen of the Year award in 1997 for his work on the Annenberg project. For Obama, the chairmanship of the $100 million Annenberg board helped vault him from a South Side lawyer to political player. And there, too, is an Ayers connection. In 1995, months after the little-known Obama became Annenberg chairman, state Sen. Alice Palmer introduced the young lawyer as her political heir apparent. The introduction was made over coffee at the home of Ayers and Dohrn. Two people who attended the event told CNN the introduction of Obama included a solicitation for campaign funds. Obama senior aide Dunn said it was just a coincidence the event occurred at the home of the two former Weather Underground members. "A Democrat state senator organizes the meeting at the home of one of her supporters," Dunn said. "What is the problem here? It is the worst kind of inference and the worst kind of politics to say that says something about Barack Obama." Palmer rarely speaks to reporters. But she recently denied to CNN that she organized the political affair for Obama, although she said she attended. Dr. Quentin Young, a longtime physician, now retired, referred to the gathering as the political coming-out party for Obama. Young said it was a small group -- maybe a dozen or so people -- who were being introduced to the next senator from Chicago's South Side, and that money was raised for Obama at the event. Sunday, senior Obama strategist David Axlerod told CNN that Obama "didn't know the history" of Ayers' notorious past when the political event was held. Ayers' past has been well-chronicled and well-known in Chicago. His late father Thomas, a wealthy and prominent executive of the public utility Commonwealth Edison, worked tirelessly and publicly to re-establish his son into Chicago society. But the Obama-Ayers connection exploded into the national news Saturday when McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, accused Obama of "palling around" with a domestic terrorist. The Obama campaign calls the charge "ludicrous," and there is no evidence to show the two men are pals -- although in an interview earlier this year with Politico, Axlerod said the two men were friendly. Obama and Ayers had a connection not just through the education and charity boards, but in the area of juvenile justice. Obama praised Ayers' book on the subject in a 1997 Chicago Tribune review, calling it "a searing and timely account of the juvenile court system, and the courageous individuals who rescue hope from despair." In an event organized by Obama's wife Michelle, then-Illinois state Sen. Obama was listed as a panelist along with Ayers on a discussion involving juvenile justice issues. At the time, Obama was fighting legislation that would put more juveniles under the purview of adult courts.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi: I did not violate house arrestStory Highlights Junta says Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest does not expire for six more months Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is on trial with American John Yettaw Suu Kyi told Myanmar court that she is not guilty, has not broken any law Yettaw is charged with violating the conditions of Suu Kyi's house arrest Next Article in World » Read VIDEOEXPLAINER YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the stand for the first time Tuesday and told a Myanmar court that she did not violate her house arrest when she offered temporary shelter to an American man who swam to her lakeside home. People of Myanmar living in Japan protest for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday in Tokyo, Japan. "She was very confident, very firm, very clear," said Mark Canning, the British ambassador to Myanmar, who was among diplomats and journalists allowed to watch the proceedings. "In a strange way, she commanded the courtroom," he said. Suu Kyi, who is being tried on subversion charges, said she did not learn immediately that John William Yettaw swam nearly two miles and snuck into her crumbling, colonial-era bungalow on May 3. She was told about the visitor the next day by one of two housekeepers who are her sole companions in the heavily guarded residence, where she was under house arrest. Suu Kyi's two helpers are also on trial, as is Yettaw. "I didn't know," she said. "I was upstairs." Under questioning by a judge for half an hour, Suu Kyi said she provided Yettaw food but allowed him only to "stay temporarily." Yettaw left late May 5, she said. "He walked to the lakeside. But I don't know which way he went, because it was very dark," Suu Kyi said. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate also acknowledged that Yettaw, a 53-year-old former military serviceman from Falcon, Missouri, had visited her once before last November.

"Did you report to the authority about his arrival?" the judge asked. "No," she replied. Suu Kyi had earlier told supporters that she did not tell authorities about the latest intrusion because she didn't want Yettaw or anyone else to get in trouble. But it is this silence that the Myanmar's military junta is trying her for. The government said Yettaw's presence violated the conditions of Suu Kyi's house arrest. The country's regime rarely allows Suu Kyi any visitors, and foreigners are not allowed overnight stays in local households without government permission. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 13 of the past 19 years -- a confinement the military junta has regularly extended. Watch the U.N. secretary general explain what he is doing for Suu Kyi » Her latest round of home detention -- after five years of confinement -- expires Wednesday, according to her supporters at home and abroad. Last week, the military began prosecuting Suu Kyi on allegations of subversion at a prison compound near Yangon. Her supporters say the move is meant to keep her confined even longer -- beyond the general elections that the junta has scheduled for next year. If convicted, Suu Kyi, 63, could be sentenced to three to five years in prison. Before the proceedings got under way at the Insean Prison compound Tuesday, the junta said Suu Kyi's house arrest did not expire for six more months. And though the government said it considered releasing her at the end of the term, it said it had no choice but to try her after she met with Yettaw. "As Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of Gen. Aung San, the leader of our country, we were deeply thinking whether to extend her detention or not," Police Brigadier General Myint Thein told reporters Tuesday. "Unfortunately, a U.S. citizen entered her house for two days. She allowed and made conversation with him, gave him food. "These kind of actions broke the law," he added. "This is why we have no way but to open a case. And we are very sad about this case." Gen. Aung San played an instrumental role in bringing about the country's independence from British colonial rule. He was assassinated in 1947 and is still revered in Myanmar. Suu Kyi's lawyers rejected the junta's explanation, saying the United Nations had already deemed the opposition leader's continuing detention unlawful under Myanmar's state protection laws. "The U.N. has said her house arrest expired a year ago," said Jared Genser, her U.S.-based lawyer. "They are out of time, and they cannot detain her any longer under their own law." Thein told reporters that the pro-democracy advocate had actually been under house arrest for four-and-a-half years. The official said Suu Kyi's house arrest officially went into effect on November 28, 2004. That gives the government six more months to restrict her movement, he said. Genser countered the government's account, citing the conclusion of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The law is unclear whether detention begins from the time a person is arrested or when a detention order is issued, the council said. "This would suggest an interpretation that you start counting from the day you begin to detain her," Genser said. In Suu Kyi's case, she was put under house arrest in May 2003. "You can't issue an order months later and use that as your starting point. That creates an unfair period of detention," he said. After Suu Kyi's testimony Tuesday, the court asked the diplomats and journalists to leave. It denied a defense request to consult with Suu Kyi privately. The court then questioned Yettaw. He is charged with violating immigration laws and trespassing. The charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. A lawyer selected by the U.S. Embassy is representing him. According to Yettaw's testimony in court Friday, he made the unauthorized trip because he had a vision that Suu Kyi would be assassinated, and he wanted to warn her. He muttered to himself during the proceedings, including utterances that Suu Kyi is innocent, said Nyan Win, spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. Suu Kyi's prosecution has prompted international criticism, with nine Nobel laureates -- including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa -- calling it a "mockery." U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the charges against Suu Kyi "baseless" and accused the junta of "continuing resistance to a free and open electoral process." The Nobel laureate has been the face of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and the focus of a global campaign to free her. Her party won over 80 percent of the legislative seats in 1990. But she was disqualified from serving because of her house arrest, and the military junta ignored the results. The government has said next year's scheduled elections will reintroduce democracy in Myanmar. But its plan includes a clause that forbids citizens who bore children with foreigners from running for office. That makes Suu Kyi ineligible. She married a British man and has two sons with him.

Holocaust victims database aims to restore lost identities By Shirley Henry and Athena Jones, CNN
updated 10:30 AM EST, Sat November 26, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
More than 2,100 volunteers around the world have signed on to the World Memory Project
Project is world's largest online searchable database of records related to Holocaust victims
Volunteers have added more than 765,000 records to the database in six months
Nazis gave them numbers, and project gives them back their names, director says
(CNN) -- Alison Shein considers herself an amateur genealogist, spending hours online searching for information about family members she never knew.
Among them: Alison's great-great-grandmother Bella Shein, who died in the Holocaust. The circumstances surrounding her death are still murky.
"They were living in this town called Volkovysk, which is currently in Belarus, and when the Germans were coming, some of her children and her grandchildren said, 'OK, we're going to leave. We're going to go with the Russian army.' And she said, 'I'm too old. I'm going to stay behind.' And that was the last they saw of her."
Through her research, Shein determined that her great-great-grandmother was probably killed in that town, like other elderly people, rather than transported by the Nazis to the Treblinka extermination camp.
She is still looking for information about other family members.
Shein has also embarked on another project, one that will help others -- strangers -- find clues about what happened to their loved ones in the Holocaust.
"I just think that it's really important to keep the memory of these people who died alive. I've heard stories so many times where they said, 'We had survivors who are our relatives, and they just didn't want to talk about it. We just don't know what happened.' "
Shein is one of more than 2,100 volunteers around the world who have signed on to the World Memory Project, a joint effort by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and Ancestry.com, a family research website, to create the world's largest online searchable database of records related to victims of the Holocaust.
It's a massive undertaking: The museum has more than 170 million documents about victims of Nazi persecution, including Nazi concentration camp records and transport lists, records created by Jewish communities and U.S. government documents about people displaced by the war who later emigrated to the United States.
Sara Clark, left, and Andrea Bertrand index documents as part of the World Memory Project.
The project, which began in May, recruits volunteers like Shein to put names and other key words from the documents into an online database, which is then searchable by anyone in the world. The first data sets became searchable this month.
Once people locate information online about family members, they can request copies of the full documents from the museum. The service is free and will remain so permanently.
Volunteers have added more than 765,000 records to the database in the six months since the project began, and the number goes up everyday. Compare that with the process before the project's launch, when a museum intern indexed the records and managed to complete about 1,000 records a month.
Speed is a key part of the World Memory Project.
"Clearly, we're in a race against time to help survivors find out what happened to their loved ones before it's too late," said Lisa Yavnai, director of the project.
It allows survivors and family members who are unable to travel to the museum in Washington to access the information from the comfort of their own homes, said Quinton Atkinson, director of Ancestry.com's content acquisition. And for anyone who wants to contribute to the project, they can do so from anywhere in the world.
"You can do it at 2 o'clock in the morning in your pajamas," Atkinson explained, just by going to worldmemoryproject.org and following the steps to download the software, which was developed by Ancestry.com. No special skills are required, no computer or language expertise, he said.
To ensure accuracy, two volunteers index each document. Their work is reviewed by a third, more experienced arbitrator, who resolves any discrepancies.
Both Atkinson and Yavnai describe the response to the project as overwhelming. Volunteers include those as young as 12, with help from their parents, as well as some Holocaust survivors who are in their 70s and 80s.
"This project is about restoring the identities of the victims, the people who the Nazis tried to erase. They -- the Nazis -- gave them numbers, and we are giving them back their names, and the public can help us do this," Yavnai said.

Cape Cod dolphin death toll reaches 103
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:34 PM EST, Fri February 10, 2012
About 160 common dolphins have been found stranded on Cape Cod since early January.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
103 dolphins die on Cape Cod, Massachusetts Common dolphins started coming ashore in early January
The beachings have puzzled investigators
(CNN) -- The number of unexplained dolphin deaths on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, rose Friday, with rescuers tallying the toll at 103.
About 160 common dolphins have been found since the animals began stranding themselves in early January, said Michael Booth, a spokesman for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the organization leading the rescue the effort.
The beachings have puzzled investigators, as rescue team members struggle to treat, tag and transport the living dolphins to the outer Cape Cod coast to be released.
While dolphin strandings are not uncommon on the cape, Katie Moore, a marine manager for the group, said earlier this week the event is extraordinary in its "protracted" nature as well as the number of dolphins involved.
"There is a large variability year to year," she said, but this event represents "more than half my annual average in a month," said Moore.
Once beached, a dolphin is vulnerable to predators and susceptible to organ damage and sunburn. If a dolphin is still alive, the responders get it onto its stomach, if it is not already, for easier breathing. They keep away seagulls that would otherwise peck at it and warm it with blankets or cool it with water as necessary, Moore said.
Necropsies had been performed on at least nine of the dolphins, and blood and microbial swab samples have been taken from some that were found alive, Moore said.
So far, no pattern of disease or trauma has been found that would point to a cause.
Although the winter and early spring are the normal time of year for dolphin strandings to occur, the weather this season has been unusually warm, leading to speculation about climate change and subsequently low "distribution of prey" as possible causes.
Wellfleet harbormaster Michael Flanagan had earlier explained that usually, in the winter, "the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore. But now that the water is warmer, we're seeing lots more dolphins washing up than ever before."
Moore cautioned that, while climate or other external factors such as acoustic disorientation can't be ruled out, "we don't have a single answer."

Balotelli settles dispute with Man City
updated 2:35 PM EST, Wed December 19, 2012
Mario Balotelli has had an eventful two years in English football under the leadership of Roberto Mancini at Manchester City
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli settles his dispute with the English champions
Italian dropped an appeal to a Premier League tribunal over his disciplinary record
Balotelli accepted a two-week fine for misdemeanors during last season
(CNN) -- There is rarely a dull moment in the career of Mario Balotelli but the controversial striker has at least been prepared to take his medicine in the latest spat with his club Manchester City.
The Italian striker had appealed to an English Premier League tribunal after he was fined for a poor disciplinary record during City's title-winning season in 2011/12.
Balotelli, signed from Inter Milan by City boss Roberto Mancini for $39.1 million in 2010, missed a total of 11 domestic and European games through suspension and was reportedly fined two weeks wages by his club as a result.
The 22-year-old appealed the decision and his lawyers had been preparing to state his case at a Premier League tribunal on Wednesday.
Manchester derby thriller marred by 'English disease'
Mourinho on the enigma of Balotelli
Can Balotelli lead Italy to glory?
Euro 2012 sparked into life when striker Robert Lewandowski scored the first goal of the tournament against Greece. Despite a lively opening, the co-hosts had to settle for a 1-1 draw.
Ukraine were the other team to welcome Europe's finest, but the co-hosts fell behind in their opening match with Sweden. Step forward Andriy Shevchenko, the legendary striker who scored a second-half brace to delight the nation and secure a 2-1 win.
Tensions were high ahead of Poland's clash with Russia. The hosts fell behind when Alan Dzagoev headed in his third goal of the tournament, but Poland's captain Jakub Blaszczykowski fired in a stunning second-half equalizer to level the match. Despite the draw, Poland failed to make it out of the group stages.
Russia were also condemned to an early exit after 2004 champions Greece stunned Dick Advocaat's team by winning 1-0 and reaching the last eight.
Despite being heralded by some as pre-tournament favorites, the Netherlands endured a miserable campaign, losing all three of their matches in a group which included Germany, Portugal and Denmark. Coach Bert van Marwijk resigned following the country's group-stage exit.
Ukraine needed to beat England to qualify from Group D, but went behind as Wayne Rooney scored on his return from suspension. Artem Milevskiy thought he had leveled when his shot appeared to cross the goal line, but John Terry cleared and England advanced alongside France.
Cristiano Ronaldo's personal mission to beat the Czech Republic succeeded in the closing stages as he superbly headed Portugal into the semifinals of Euro 2012.
Joint-favorites Germany were far too strong for Greece in the quarterfinals, thrashing Fernando Santos' side despite resting three of their forwards for the game.
Xabi Alonso scored both of Spain's goals in the quarterfinal against France, leading the champions into a showdown with neighbors Portugal on the occasion of his 100th cap.
Andrea Pirlo was the coolest man in Kyiv as he chipped in this effort in a shootout against England. Italy advanced as Ashley Cole missed and Alessandro Diamanti fired in the decisive spot kick.
Having got the order of the takers wrong, Bruno Alves compounded his own misery by smashing his penalty against the bar as Portugal lost in the semis to Spain.
Cesc Fabregas' scuffed penalty went in off the post as Spain beat Portugal in their semifinal shootout to earn a place in the final against Italy in Kiev on Sunday.
Controversial striker Mario Balotelli was Italy's hero in the semifinals, scoring twice as the Azzurri stunned Joachim Low's Germany with a 2-1 win.

Unforgettable moments of Euro 2012
But a statement released by the club confirmed the Italy international had dropped his appeal after the two parties resolved their differences.
"After amicable talks between the parties, as a sign of respect for Roberto Mancini, the supporters and the club, Mario Balotelli has chosen to accept a two week fine levied upon him by the club and withdraw his disciplinary appeal, which was due to be heard by a Premier League panel," it read.
"Mario remains available for selection for all forthcoming fixtures."
Balotelli has infuriated his manager on several occasions during his two seasons at the club, Mancini stating only recently that the striker needed to train harder to get into the team.
Twice Balotelli hasn't made City's 25-man squad in the Premier League this campaign and he was substituted at halftime in City's recent 3-2 derby defeat to neighbors Manchester United.
Despite his disciplinary record, Balotelli did set up a goal for Argentina striker Sergio Aguero that secured City their first title in 44 years on a dramatic final day of last season.
That came after Mancini said Balotelli may never play for the club again after he was sent off during a defeat at Arsenal that had seemed to spell the end to their title campaign.
Balotelli played a key role in Italy's team as they made the final of Euro 2012, where they were beaten 4-1 by World champions Spain.

States saying 'no' to Medicaid expansion, but low-income citizens, patients worried
By Halimah Abdullah, CNN
updated 10:57 AM EDT, Sun April 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Half of states will expand Medicaid under Obamacare; half refuse or are on the fence
Low-income citizens and their advocates say Medicaid expansion necessary States like Texas, Florida say a Medicaid expansion is costly and will fail
Politics at play and most states will eventually expand the program, political experts say
Washington (CNN) -- Bettina Cox battled cervical cancer in 2012. A year later, the Texas native feels that narrowly qualifying for a Medicaid-sponsored program for low-income and uninsured female cancer patients saved her life.
She now wants her governor and state legislature to support an expansion of Medicaid -- part of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act -- that she feels could save the lives of thousands of other women in her state by helping them detect diseases much earlier.
But if Texas lawmakers have their way -- as well as governors and legislatures in Florida, South Carolina and nearly a dozen other states -- low-income Americans like Cox may not have expanded access to funds needed for such procedures. Those states feel the expansion is an unnecessary government overreach at a time when spending should be limited, not expanded.
Still, for some, the impact on their lives is very real.
Government reverses plan to cut Medicare Advantage rate
"If I had Medicaid expansion, I would have found a doctor sooner than later" Bettina Cox, cancer survivor
"If I had Medicaid expansion, I would have found a doctor sooner than later," said Cox. At 60, she was too young to qualify for Medicare and said she was also told she didn't qualify for traditional Medicaid treatment available to women of childbearing age. "As soon as I felt ill, I would have gone to go check."
Instead, Cox said, her tumor went unchecked for months, growing to the size of a grapefruit. Eventually an oncologist, working largely on a pro bono basis, properly diagnosed Cox as having stage 1 cervical cancer and helped her find health coverage under a Medicaid provision mandating treatment for women with breast and cervical cancer. The catch: The program was only available to women who weren't already covered by insurance or Medicaid.
"It saved my life, it actually saved my life," Cox said of the treatment she received.
Political rising stars in Texas, like their counterparts in nearly half the country, are drawing partisan battle lines over extending federally subsidized health care to more than a million of the state's poorest residents.
This week, a Texas showdown pitted Gov. Rick Perry against Democratic Party favorites the Castro brothers -- U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro -- in dueling press conferences on expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm a self-employed artist and the mother of a 3-year-old and I'm not eligible to receive Medicaid. Private health insurance is not an option," Melissa Knight, who spoke at the Castro rally, said later. "There are a lot of people who are working really hard. They aren't being lazy, they just don't have the means for extra insurance. It's about trying to provide for your family."
Premiums could rise under Obamacare
Partisan divide on health care remains
The faceoff was equal parts an ideological fight over the merits of Obamacare and a foreshadowing of how that policy will influence high-stakes political races.
"Medicaid expansion is a misguided, and ultimately doomed, attempt to mask the shortcomings of Obamacare," said Perry, a former Republican presidential candidate who is thought to be considering another run for the White House in 2016. "It would benefit no one in our state to see their taxes skyrocket and our economy crushed as our budget crumbled under the weight of oppressive Medicaid costs."
"Governor, being tough on people with no health insurance won't win you the Republican presidential primary in 2016," Joaquin Castro wrote in a Dallas Morning News op-ed. "It definitely won't win you the presidency."
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, unleashed a similarly blistering critique of his Republican counterpart in South Carolina, Nikki Haley, in remarks to a Democratic Party conference in Charleston last month. O'Malley attacked Haley, who is up for re-election next year, as a "tea party Republican" who cares more about voter ID laws than expanding health care access and education for South Carolina.
Then there's the plight of politicians like Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, who endorsed expanding Medicaid in his state using federal dollars in Florida, only to be met with opposition by fellow Republicans in the Sunshine State's legislature. Scott, who campaigned heavily against Obama's health care law in 2010, said he would accept the federal dollars last month, but his state's Republican-controlled legislature has since opposed the move.
"It's creating the same type of tensions among many conservatives that are taking place at the national level, at state level," said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. "You have a lot of governors who have national aspirations and have a huge incentive not to reject those funds. ... Then there are conservative legislators who have no national aspirations who are sticking to their position."
The Supreme Court ruled last year that states can opt out of broadening Medicaid coverage, striking down one of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
Since then, about half of the states have said they'll opt in to expanded Medicaid. Nearly a quarter say they won't participate, with the remaining quarter still on the fence, according to figures from the Advisory Board Company, a policy consulting firm.
"Medicaid expansion is a misguided, and ultimately doomed, attempt to mask the shortcomings of Obamacare" Texas Gov. Rick Perry
"Things got much more complicated," Don Berwick, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said of the Supreme Court ruling. "There are now many more options where states can customize. ... In states where they are more politically ambivalent, it becomes more complicated."
Republican governors in at least eight states have agreed to Medicaid expansion, which would extend coverage to all adults with income below 138% of the poverty line. It's part of the Obama administration's push for universal insurance, and the federal government is dangling a big carrot to make it happen. It will cover each state's expansion costs in full for the first three years. After that, states will be responsible for no more than 10% of the tab.
Some of the states that have decided to opt out have some of the highest uninsured rates in the nation.
Take, for example, Texas, where nearly a quarter of the residents are uninsured.
Some 1.75 million adults would be newly eligible if the state joins in. It stands to gain $25.3 billion in federal funds over four years to insure poor adults, while spending $1.3 billion, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for low-income Texans.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission said Medicaid expansion would prove costly to the tune of "tens of billions in combined state and federal funds over the next 10 years."
Still, in the end, the pushback against expansion may amount to just that, political experts said.
"If you're betting, you bet that in the end they're going to take the money. The states need money and this would cover a large amount of people," Zelizer said, adding that the holdouts will face mounting opposition both within and outside of their party. "Part of it will come from moderate Republicans who don't want to have a party painted as extremists. Part of it will come from needs of the electorate because there is a great need."
People like Cox and Knight say lawmakers had better pay heed to that need.
"I feel frustrated because as a citizen because I don't feel supported by my leaders," Knight said.

Evacuation operation aborted as U.S. planes come under fire in South Sudan By Barbara Starr and Tom Watkins, CNN
updated 1:18 PM EST, Sun December 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: African Union calls for an immediate truce Wounded service members in stable condition in Kenya, military official says
U.S. troops were on mission to evacuate Americans from violence-hit city
Pentagon trying to determine how to evacuate more than 30 Americans
Washington (CNN) -- A mission to evacuate Americans from South Sudan was aborted Saturday when an aircraft carrying U.S. military members was fired upon as it prepared to land in Bor, wounding four of them, the Pentagon said.
The most severely damaged aircraft was thought to have been hit in the fuel line, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity said.
All three aircraft -- CV-22 Ospreys -- were diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, which is not where their flights originated, the official said. Another aircraft then flew the wounded to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement.
The four service members were in stable condition after treatment, the statement said.
Pentagon officials were trying to determine how to mount another effort to evacuate the roughly three dozen Americans in South Sudan, where they have been working for the United Nations, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was "reviewing options," Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. "Whatever we do it will be in coordination with the State Department," he added.
The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed before dawn Saturday while aboard Air Force One after landing in Hawaii, then met with his national security team on the matter.
The fighting has displaced as many as 100,000 people, many of whom have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding.
South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting this month's violence.
Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community.
Casualties include soldiers and number in the hundreds, the government said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kiir on Saturday and discussed ways to halt the violence. It was Kerry's second call to Kiir since Thursday night.
"Secretary Kerry emphasized that only through leadership and political dialogue will the challenges facing South Sudan be resolved," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.
The two men "discussed the need to prevent ethnic violence, their concern for the welfare of thousands of internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict, as well as for the safety of U.S. citizens in South Sudan, and they agreed to speak again soon," she said.
Meanwhile, the State Department issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens, calling on them to avoid the area around the airport in Bor. Limited flights were continuing from Juba International Airport.
On Friday, Kerry said he was sending a special envoy -- Ambassador Donald Booth -- to the country.
"Now is the time for South Sudan's leaders to rein in armed groups under their control, immediately cease attacks on civilians, and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups," Kerry said in a statement.
Saturday's violence wasn't the first this week to harm foreign troops in South Sudan. On Thursday, attackers killed two Indian army peacekeepers, wounded a third, and killed 20 of 30 civilians who were seeking refuge at the United Nations' Akobo base, the U.N. said.
In a news release, the African Union called for an immediate truce.
It said that the chairwoman of the AU Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was "profoundly dismayed at the recent turn of events" and condemned the killing of innocent civilians and U.N. peacekeepers in Bor as a war crime.
South Sudan became the world's newest country when it split from Sudan in July 2011. The split happened after a 2005 peace agreement ended years of civil war between the largely Animist and Christian south and the Muslim-dominated north.
The deal led to a January 2011 referendum in which people of the south voted to secede from Sudan.

His grandson Kitama Cahill Jackson told CNN that the singer died of natural causes at New York Presbyterian Hospital on Monday evening.
Familiar with controversy
In a career spanning more than 70 years, Seeger frequently courted controversy.
"He lived at a time when so many things hadn't been done yet, the idea of making music about something hadn't really been done," Jackson said. "And now people do it all the time."
Seeger's opinions didn't always sit well with authorities.
"From the start, he aspired to use folk music to promote his left-wing political views, and in times of national turmoil that brought him into direct confrontation with the U.S. government, corporate interests, and people who did not share his beliefs," William Ruhlmann wrote in a biography on allmusic.com. "These conflicts shaped his career."
Early career
In 2009, Seeger talked to CNN about the beginnings of his music career in the late 1930s.
"I come from a family of teachers, and I was looking for a job on a newspaper and not getting one," he said in the interview. "I had an aunt who said, 'Peter, I can get five dollars for you if you come and sing some of your songs in my class.' Five dollars? In 1939, you would have to work all day or two days to make five dollars. It seemed like stealing."
But Seeger said he took his aunt up on the offer.
"Pretty soon I was playing school after school, and I never did work on a newspaper," he said "You don't have to play at nightclubs, you don't have to play on TV, just go from college to college to college, and the kids will sing along with you."
Last days
Jackson, Seeger's grandson, said the singer-songwriter had heart surgery in December to replace a valve, which had gone well and had nothing to do with his death.
He said Seeger was in the hospital for six days before his death.
He couldn't speak for the last three days, Jackson said, but his mind never went away and he continued to recognize people.
"He was a second father to me, he was a friend, he was a best friend," Jackson said. "He was just this wonderful, genuine person."
