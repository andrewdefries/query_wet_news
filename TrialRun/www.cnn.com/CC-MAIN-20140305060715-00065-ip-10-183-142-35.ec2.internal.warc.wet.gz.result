Crime writer Walter Mosley debuts new series Story Highlights Writer Walter Mosley is best known for his Easy Rawlins mystery series His new book, "The Long Fall," introduces the character of Leonid McGill Unlike past books, the new novel is set in modern-day New York Mosley says he enjoyed first time writing a "hard-boiled detective" novel Next Article in Entertainment » By Lisa Respers France CNN	(CNN) -- Fans of the character Easy Rawlins don't want to hear it, but author Walter Mosley says he has officially moved on. Author Walter Mosley found fame with his Easy Rawlins mysteries and has debuted a new series. The prolific writer seemingly wrapped up his beloved series -- which spawned the 1995 film "Devil in a Blue Dress" starring Denzel Washington -- in 2007 with the 10th Easy Rawlins mystery, "Blonde Faith." The ending saddened die-hard fans who had faithfully followed the adventures of the Los Angeles, California-based everyman-turned-private investigator whose stories played out in an era from the Jim Crow 1940s to the politically charged 1960s. Now Mosley, who has found success writing everything from erotica to science fiction, has launched a new mystery series with the release of his book "The Long Fall" (Riverhead). The book features an ex-boxer named Leonid Trotter McGill, the latest colorfully named Mosley character. Three of his previous books involved ex-convict Socrates Fortlow, and another trio concerned bookseller Paris Minton. Don't Miss Children's books: Classic reading for fans
Walter Mosley's website
But the new novel takes Mosley to a different place and time. Instead of mid-20th century Los Angeles, "The Long Fall" is set in modern-day New York, where McGill is finding it hard to leave his less-than-stellar past behind. That past includes a childhood as a red-diaper baby abandoned by his union organizer father and left to fend for himself at an early age, a loveless marriage to an unfaithful woman named Katrina and a son who's a burgeoning criminal mastermind. Moreover, he's at work on a case where you just know people are going to die. Such page turners are nothing new for Mosley, who is known for his strong, black male characters and his passionate musings on race, politics and the writing life. McGill's creator recently spoke with CNN about the new mystery novel, why he doesn't miss Easy, and how the changes in the United States are mirrored in his writing. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Why leave Los Angeles for a setting in modern-day New York? Walter Mosley: I have been a resident of both cities. The new series being contemporary and about a character who in some murky ways reflects where America is right now, New York seemed the right place for that. CNN: How so? Where do you think America is right now? Mosley: I think that America has made a decision, after about 20 years of going in one direction, to go in another direction: to leave rampant and amoral kind of deregulation and also rampant and immoral wars and say, "Maybe we should be doing the right thing instead of the wrong thing," or redefining what the right thing is, at any rate. Those kinds of decisions, there are only two places [the setting] can be, and that's either in Washington, D.C., which I feel is very limiting because it's a one-business town, or New York, where everything from economics to government is centered. So I decided on New York. CNN: McGill is trying to leave behind his shady past. Do you feel like America is trying to do the same? Mosley: Yes, I think that's exactly what's happening. I think America is trying to seek redemption after having done many things wrong in the eyes of the world in general. Leonid McGill is trying to seek redemption after a long criminal history. His history is somewhat forgivable, but still it's criminal. CNN: Did you approach this book differently than you did when you were writing the Easy Rawlins mysteries? Mosley: Yes and no. All books are different, so each of the Easy Rawlins books I wrote I approached differently. [Leonid] is a new character and he has a unique life that I had to begin to learn. I knew Easy very well, but Leonid I had to learn who he was. CNN: In your new book, I love that McGill's wife's name is "Katrina" and she leaves lots of destruction in her wake. Mosley: [chuckling] It's true, but the first story I wrote about Leonid [a story called "Karma" published in the anthology "Dangerous Women"] was before the hurricane and that was a long time ago. It's funny that it worked out like that. CNN: What do you like about McGill? Mosley: This is the first time in my experiments in crime fiction that I've written a hard-boiled detective character. This is going all the way back to the beginning of the genre in the '30s, where you have a guy who gets thumped upside the head a lot and he's just as bad as the people he's after. In the old style, you never knew what was going on inside the hard-boiled character's head, but in these stories I am actually discovering the underlying character of the hard-boiled detective, and for me that's been a great deal of fun. CNN: You've written so many various genres. What is it about the genre of crime fiction that appeals to you? Mosley: Originally I got into it because you can talk about worlds that people wouldn't read about ordinarily unless they had a particular interest in it. Everybody reads crime fiction and they read it to find out about different worlds. I like writing in different genres. There's all this stuff that I really enjoy doing because I think they all serve different purposes. And listen, I'm known as a crime writer, people like it and I enjoy it. CNN: For your fans, a lot of them miss Easy Rawlins. Do you miss him at all? Mosley: No, he's right there on the shelf. All I have to do is reach up and pull him down. I'm finished with that. I'm moving on.

Libya says Gadhafi's son killed in airstrike, vows death to 'invaders' From Frederik Pleitgen, CNN Gadhafi's son killed?STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Empty Western embassies are vandalized after Gadhafi's son is reported deadNEW: Russia says it has "serious doubts" about NATO's targetingA NATO airstrike also killed 3 Gadhafi grandchildren, the Libyan government saysThe government vows to "make Libya the grave of all invaders" Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan government said Sunday that ruler Moammar Gadhafi's son and three of his grandchildren died in a NATO airstrike that the longtime strongman and his wife survived. Gadhafi and his wife were in their son's house when it was targeted, but they are in good health, government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists. But the son, Saif al-Arab Gadhafi, and three of his children were killed, Ibrahim said. The Libyan government vowed to retaliate with death to "invaders" in the nation, and empty Western embassies were vandalized on Sunday, U.S. and Italian officials said. But CNN could not independently confirm the reported fatalities, and a spokesman for anti-Gadhafi rebels cast doubt on the claim even as it provoked celebratory gunfire in rebel-held Benghazi. Ibrahim slammed NATO after the airstrike, calling the attack an illegal act and a "war crime." He said the 29-year-old son killed was a student in Germany, the sixth of eight children. The strike destroyed the house in Tripoli, leaving a massive crater. Saif al-Arab Gadhafi is one of two sons of the Libyan leader whose names begin with Saif. Another son -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- had previously touted reform, but has emerged as one of his father's most visible defenders in recent months. The commander of the NATO operation, Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, said NATO was aware of "unconfirmed media reports" that members of Gadhafi's family had been killed in an airstrike. "We regret all loss of life, especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict," said Bouchard, a Canadian air force general. But he said all targets "are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals."

But Russia, which has criticized the allied campaign, said it had "serious doubts" about NATO's assertion that it is not targeting Gadhafi and his family. "The disproportional use of force, all the more so, beyond the mandate of U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1973, which in no way stipulates the replacement of the Libyan leadership, is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official RIA Novosti news agency. "We are again calling for strict compliance with the provisions of the decisions made by the international community on the Libyan conflict, for an immediate cease-fire and the start of a political settlement without any preconditions." The airstrikes started March 19, after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler, who has been in power for nearly 42 years. A senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said the U.S. government is "very aware" of the reports of Gadhafi's son's death, but cannot confirm who, if anyone, died in a strike until they see the evidence. Gunfire broke out around Tripoli after the news came out. A crowd of demonstrators gathered around the ruler's compound. Images on Libyan state TV showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags. Protesters could be heard yelling, "We want to redeem the martyr," and, "Oh youth, this is time for jihad." They were joined at one point by Ibrahim, who told the demonstrators, "Every one of you are Saif al-Arab." "We will make Libya the grave of all invaders," he told the crowd. A spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the report of the death. "In all honesty, we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising," said Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi. "We don't believe this is true," Ghoga said. "It is all fabrications by the regime in a desperate attempt to get sympathy. ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying." Despite skepticism by some rebels, some opposition members celebrated the report of Saif al-Arab's death in the streets of Benghazi. Revelers danced and sang overnight as the sound of celebratory gunfire pierced through the air. "By God, we're not supposed to rejoice anyone's death," one man told CNN. "But we want him to feel the pain and sorrow that we're going through with our own people he killed." Many of the reported civilian deaths have come out of the western city of Misrata. On Sunday, a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country's third-largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of Gadhafi's son. This is not the first time the ruler has reportedly been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children. In April 1986, his adopted daughter, Hanna Gadhafi, was killed when U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted his residential compound. At the time, U.S. President Ronald Reagan said the strikes were an act of self-defense following the bombing of a West Berlin, Germany, club that killed two American servicemen and injured several others.CNN's Reza Sayah, Kareem Khadder, Saad Abedine and Phil Gast and contributed to this report.

Cuba says jailed U.S. contractor doesn't have cancer
From Patrick Oppmann, CNN
updated 11:24 AM EST, Wed November 28, 2012
Alan Gross is serving a 15-year sentence in Havana for bringing banned communications equipment.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Alan Gross has been jailed in Cuba since 2009
His family and lawyer are worried about his health, and suggested he may have cancer
Cuban officials say a biopsy shows Gross is not suffering from cancer
Gross' lawyer said plans are being made for an American specialist to review the results
Havana (CNN) -- An American jailed in Cuba has chronic health problems but is not suffering from cancer as had been suggested by his attorney, the Cuban government said on Wednesday.
Alan Gross, a U.S. State Department contractor, is serving a 15-year sentence in Havana for bringing banned communications equipment to the island.

In recent months, Gross' family and his attorney have said his health is failing and that he has suffered significant weight loss since his arrest three years ago.
His attorney, Jared Genser, said in a statement in October that a mass of tissue on Gross' right shoulder could be cancer.
Who is Alan Gross?
Cuba asks for a hostage swap But Cuban authorities said a medical team conducted a biopsy that showed the mass was not cancerous.
Test results were revealed to U.S. officials at a meeting on Monday in Havana, Cuba's foreign ministry said in a statement. The Cuban Interest Section in Washington told Gross' wife.

"The Cuban medical team likewise ratified that the general health condition of Mr. Gross is normal and that he is receiving the treatment required by his diseases, including the chronic illnesses that are typical of his age, which he had been suffering from even before his detention," the statement said.
"Mr. Gross maintains a systematic physical exercises regime on a voluntary basis and eats a balanced diet that includes foods of his choice," the statement said.

Genser said in a statement that "we very much hope that these test results are accurate" and "do not doubt the Cuban government's belief that Mr. Gross is healthy."
But he also said Cuba's own test results "raise doubts" about their conclusiveness and plans are in the works for an American oncologist to review them.
"We urge the Cuban government to allow this to happen promptly so we can put questions about Mr. Gross' health to rest," Genser said.
Cuban officials said in September that they wanted to negotiate Gross' case and that of five Cuban intelligence operatives held in the United States.
U.S. government officials have rebuffed any suggestion of a prisoner swap and have called for Gross' immediate release.

Stephanie Banister had been running as a candidate in the parliamentary elections in Australia next month.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Stephanie Banister was a candidate for a seat in Rankin, Queensland
Not anymore -- after she made religious and political gaffes
She later accused a television station of editing out her comments (CNN) -- A candidate in Australia's parliamentary elections referred to Islam as a country. As a result, she's now referred to as a former candidate.
Stephanie Banister, a 27-year-old welder running for a seat in Rankin, Queensland, unleashed a series of blunders during an interview with CNN affiliate 7 News.
"I don't oppose Islam as a country, but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in Australia," Banister said.
Then she added: "Less than 2% of Australians follow haram." It is unclear whether she meant the Muslim holy book, the Quran. Haram refers to things that are forbidden under Islamic law.
As if that's not enough, she got her religions all mixed up.

"Jews aren't under haram, they have their own religion which follows Jesus Christ," she said.

Judaism is based on the old testament, which predates the birth of Jesus Christ.
Her blunders, though, were not limited to religion.
She said the Australian national disability insurance scheme was "working at the moment." It is not set to begin until 2016, according to 7 News. Banister was a candidate for the anti-immigration One Nation party in next month's elections. The interview gained her worldwide notoriety -- with commentators describing her as the "Australian Sarah Palin."
Palin, who was on Republican John McCain's ticket in the 2008 presidential election and is a former governor of Alaska, is known for her blunders. During the campaign, she once cited Russia's proximity to Alaska as bolstering her foreign policy credentials.
It's unclear when Banister's interview was aired, but it went viral soon after. She accused the affiliate of editing out numerous phrases where she corrected herself and said "Islamic countries."
"With the way Channel Seven edited my interview, I was left quite the fool," Banister said.
On Saturday, the mother of two withdrew from the race, citing threats to her family.
Her campaign lasted a total of 48 hours.

Users first set up an e-mail account with PocketMail and receive a pocket-size device called TelMail TM-20. The clam-shell-shape device features a backlit screen where users can compose e-mail messages. It also has standard personal organizer features, such as an address book, scheduling, and memo functions.
To send and receive messages, users dial a toll-free number and hold TelMail TM-20 to their telephone handset. Pushing a button sends a series of acoustic signals that a transmit message of up to 4000 characters to any e-mail address. It also picks up e-mail sent to the user's PocketMail account, according to a Sharp statement. Although Sharp says the device works on any telephone worldwide, the service is currently available only in the U.S.
The product will ship to U.S. retailers at the end of November, Sharp said. The PocketMail service costs $9.95 a month. Each fax sent within the U.S. costs an additional 25 cents, and international faxes cost $1. The TelMail TM-20, which weighs 8.5 ounces, will sell for roughly $150, Sharp said. Related stories:
