Prince Harry has been "excused boots" during training in the British army after suffering agonizing blisters during an exercise, UK media reports say.The 20-year-old Prince, who is undergoing basic training at the Royal Military Academy in Surrey, developed weals on his feet after a tough five-day excursion last week.According to the Daily Mail, Harry was given permission to wear trainers for a few days until his feet healed after "a particularly nasty case" of blisters.As part of an exercise known as Operation Self-Reliance Prince Harry reportedly endured ten-mile fast marches through Ashdown Forest, southern England, carrying a heavy back pack and rifle. Normally new cadets are barred from wearing any footwear except for the heavy black lace-up boots, which are provided several months in advance so they can break them in. However, the Prince was apparently granted special dispensation to wear trainers after he asked medical staff to dress his wounds and they saw how bad the blisters were. A royal source told the UK's Press Association that the prince had visited the infirmary after developing blisters, but said it had been a "minor thing". "He's not the only one," the source told PA.

Lawyer: Police prevented Bhutto autopsyStory Highlights NEW: New video proves Bhutto shot, widower says Doctors claim Pakistani police prevented an autopsy on Benazir Bhutto Lawyer Athar Minallah said the move violated Pakistani criminal law Police chief Aziz Saud said he suggested autopsy but Bhutto's widower objected Next Article in World » Read VIDEO PHOTOS ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Rawalpindi's police chief stopped doctors at the hospital where Benazir Bhutto died from conducting an autopsy, according to a lawyer on the hospital's board. In a video released Sunday, Benazir Bhutto, far right, appears through the sunroof before shots ring out.more photos » It was a violation of Pakistani criminal law and prevented a medical conclusion about what killed the former prime minister, said Athar Minallah, who serves on the board that manages Rawalpindi General Hospital. However, the police chief involved, Aziz Saud, told CNN that he suggested an autopsy be done, but that Bhutto's husband objected. The revelation came on Monday after new videotape of Bhutto's assassination emerged, showing her slumping just after gunshots rang out. The tape provided the clearest view yet of the attack and appeared to show that Bhutto was shot. That would contradict the Pakistan government's account. Read Bhutto's full medical report A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof. He fired three shots, then there was an explosion. In the video that emerged on Sunday, Bhutto was standing, and her hair and scarf appeared to move, perhaps from the bullet. Bhutto fell into the car, then came the blast. Watch new tape showing apparent gunman » These images seem to support the theory that Bhutto died at the hands of a shooter before a bomb was detonated, killing another 23 people. Don't Miss Many theories, many questions
U.S. rejects it ignored danger Benazir Bhutto's medical report
In depth: Benazir Bhutto
Doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital declared the 54-year-old dead hours after Thursday's attack, but the cause of her death has been widely debated. Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced on Friday that Bhutto died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or the explosion and crashed her head onto a sunroof latch. See the likely sequence of events » Bhutto's family and political party maintain that the government is lying, and insist she died from gunshot wounds. Bhutto's husband, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, called for an international investigation into his wife's death, saying the new video proves the Pakistani government "has been trying to muddy the water from the first day." "Everything is now very clear that she was shot," Asif Ali Zardari said. Zardari also called on the U.S. government to push for an international probe. "I want them to help me find out who killed my wife, the mother of my children," he said of the Bush administration. Javed Iqbal Cheema, spokesman for Pakistan's Interior Ministry, said the government's conclusion on Bhutto's death was based on "absolute facts, nothing but the facts" and "it was corroborated by the doctor's report." But Minallah issued an open letter on Monday and released the doctors' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement, and he also talked to CNN. In the letter, Minallah said the doctors "suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy," but that Saud "did not agree." He noted that under the law, police investigators have "exclusive responsibility" in deciding to have an autopsy. Minallah told CNN that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were "threatened." "They are government servants who cannot speak; I am not," he said. He did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors. He said the lack of an autopsy has created "a perception that there is some kind of cover-up, though I might not believe in that theory." "There is a state within the state, and that state within the state does not want itself to be held accountable," Minallah said. Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it. Her widower has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government. Minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge. The three-page medical report, which was signed by seven doctors, described Bhutto's head wound, but it did not conclude what caused it. It noted that X-ray images were made after she was declared dead. The wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear. "Sharp bones edges were felt in the wound," it read. "No foreign body was felt in the wound." E-mail to a friend CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report

Reporter's notebook: After disasters comes the exodus from Tokyo By Kyung Lah, CNN A general view of a darkened Tokyo skyline March 15 during peak hour power cuts forced by the quake and tsunami. STORY HIGHLIGHTSMany residents of Tokyo are leaving after the impact of last week's earthquake and tsunamiLong lines reported at airports for flights to other parts of disaster-hit nationTokyo businesses say that they cannot just "pull up and leave"Some nations, such as France, are sending planes to evacuate citizens Tokyo (CNN) -- Mid-March is not a high travel season for Japan, but as the nuclear emergency at Fukushima nuclear plant persists, the airports are growing clogged with passengers. They're primarily traveling one way: out of Tokyo. Lines at Tokyo's Haneda Airport weave back and forth across the departure terminal. Families fill the seats, awaiting flights to Japan's southern and northern islands. It's a similar scene at Tokyo's largest airport, Narita International, but with bigger crowds, numbering into the thousands. Bare shelves become common in Japan

Tokyo
It is an unprecedented, albeit orderly, mass exodus out of one of the world's most populated cities amid the growing nuclear emergency at the Fukushima Nuclear Plant. International residents are the ones able to leave quickly, like French citizen Matthew Delboe. "I think when you're praying for the winds to go one way, it's time to go," says Delboe, traveling out of Tokyo to the southern island of Kyushu. The French foreign ministry says that the first plane of French people evacuated from Japan landed in Paris. The French government says it will have information about additional planes in the upcoming days. But it wasn't his government's actions that led Delboe to want to leave Tokyo. It's the lack of clarity about the future of the plant, he explains. "Two days ago, I thought there was absolutely no risk. But now I think it's stupid to stay when you can leave." It appeared many in downtown Tokyo were also either leaving or simply absent from their jobs. Restaurants say they've had slow business all week. Streets in business districts, normally bustling with people at the lunch hour on Wednesday, look like a weekend or a holiday. "It's scary," says an owner of a noodle shop, sitting outside his restaurant. When asked if he would leave, he says no. "I have my entire life here. I can't just pull up and leave." Zach Ogura, a salesman in downtown Tokyo, says he understands why so many people are leaving Tokyo, but believes at this point, it's a bit of an overreaction. "At this moment in time, I'm pretty comfortable here, doing biz as usual, but I don't know, in a few days or so, I don't know."

The case for gun rights is stronger than you think
By William J. Bennett, CNN Contributor
updated 3:54 PM EST, Wed December 19, 2012
William Bennett argues that schools would be safer with at least one armed person there who is well-trained in firearms use.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
William Bennett: Arming, training one person in a school could help prevent shootings
He says armed people have stopped instances of mass killing
Killers may target places where they know they can't be shot down, Bennett says
Bennett: Guns help prevent crime and improve public safety
Editor's note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of "The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.
(CNN) -- On NBC's "Meet the Press" this past Sunday, I was asked how we can make our schools safer and prevent another massacre like Sandy Hook from happening again. I suggested that if one person in the school had been armed and trained to handle a firearm, it might have prevented or minimized the massacre.
"And I'm not so sure -- and I'm sure I'll get mail for this -- I'm not so sure I wouldn't want one person in a school armed, ready for this kind of thing," I said. "The principal lunged at this guy. The school psychologist lunged at the guy. Has to be someone who's trained. Has to be someone who's responsible."
William Bennett
Well, I sure did get mail. Many people agreed with me and sent me examples of their son or daughter's school that had armed security guards, police officers or school employees on the premises. Many others vehemently disagreed with me, and one dissenter even wrote that the blood of the Connecticut victims was ultimately on the hands of pro-gun rights advocates.
To that person I would ask: Suppose the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary who was killed lunging at the gunman was instead holding a firearm and was well trained to use it. Would the result have been different? Or suppose you had been in that school when the killer entered, would you have preferred to be armed?
Evidence and common sense suggest yes.

In 2007, a gunman entered New Life Church in Colorado Springs and shot and killed two girls. Jeanne Assam, a former police officer stationed as a volunteer security guard at the church, drew her firearm, shot and wounded the gunman before he could kill anyone else. The gunman then killed himself.
In 1997, high school student Luke Woodham stabbed his mother to death and then drove to Pearl High School in Pearl, Mississippi, and shot and killed two people. He then got back in his car to drive to Pearl Junior High to continue his killings, but Joel Myrick, the assistant principal, ran to his truck and grabbed his pistol, aimed it at Woodham and made him surrender.
These are but a few of many examples that the best deterrent of crime when it is occurring is effective self-defense. And the best self-defense against a gunman has proved to be a firearm.

And yet, there is a near impenetrable belief among anti-gun activists that guns are the cause of violence and crime. Like Frodo's ring in "The Lord of The Rings," they believe that guns are agencies of corruption and corrupt the souls of whoever touches them. Therefore, more guns must lead to more crime.
But the evidence simply doesn't support that. Take the controversial concealed-carry permit issue, for example.
In a recent article for The Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, by no means an avowed gun-rights advocate, declared, "There is no proof to support the idea that concealed-carry permit holders create more violence in society than would otherwise occur; they may, in fact, reduce it."
Goldberg cites evidence from Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA, that concealed-carry permit holders actually commit crimes at a lower rate than the general population.
The General Accountability Office recently found that the number of concealed weapon permits in America has surged to approximately 8 million.
According to anti-gun advocates, such an increase in guns would cause a cause a corresponding increase in gun-related violence or crime. In fact, the opposite is true. The FBI reported this year that violent crime rates in the U.S. are reaching historic lows.
This comes in spite of the fact that the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Supporters of the ban (not including anti-gun groups who thought it didn't go far enough in the first place) claimed that gun crime would skyrocket when the ban was lifted. That wasn't true at all.
In fact, after the expiration of the ban, The New York Times, whose editorial pages are now awash with calls for more gun restrictions, wrote in early 2005, "Despite dire predictions that America's streets would be awash in military-style guns, the expiration of the decade-long assault weapons ban in September has not set off a sustained surge in the weapons' sales, gun makers and sellers say. It also has not caused any noticeable increase in gun crime in the past seven months, according to several city police departments."
But let's take the issue one step further and examine places where all guns, regardless of make or type, are outlawed: gun-free zones. Are gun-free zones truly safe from guns?
John Lott, economist and gun-rights advocate, has extensively studied mass shootings and reports that, with just one exception, the attack on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011, every public shooting since 1950 in the U.S. in which more than three people have been killed has taken place where citizens are not allowed to carry guns. The massacres at Sandy Hook Elementary, Columbine, Virginia Tech and the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, all took place in gun-free zones.
Do you own a gun that fell under the now-expired federal weapons ban?
These murderers, while deranged and deeply disturbed, are not dumb. They shoot up schools, universities, malls and public places where their victims cannot shoot back. Perhaps "gun-free zones" would be better named "defenseless victim zones."
To illustrate the absurdity of gun-free zones, Goldberg dug up the advice that gun-free universities offer to its students should a gunman open fire on campus. West Virginia University tells students to "act with physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter." These items could include "student desks, keys, shoes, belts, books, cell phones, iPods, book bags, laptops, pens, pencils, etc." Such "higher education" would be laughable if it weren't true and funded by taxpayer dollars.
Eliminating or restricting firearms for public self-defense doesn't make our citizens safer; it makes them targets. If we're going to have a national debate about guns, it should be acknowledged that guns, in the hands of qualified and trained individuals subject to background checks, prevent crime and improve public safety.

Nine questions about the Boston bombers
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst, and Jennifer Rowland, Special to CNN
updated 1:36 PM EDT, Sun April 21, 2013
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, identified as Suspect 2, was captured in a Boston suburb on April 19 after a manhunt that shut down the city.
From left, Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev went with Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to Times Square in this photo taken from the social media site VK.com. A federal grand jury charged Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice on Thursday, August 8. Both had been arrested and charged in May, but only with the conspiracy count. See all photography related to the Boston bombings.
Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was also arrested on May 1. He was charged with lying to federal agents about the bombing, according to court papers.
Phillipos, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the April 15 bombings. The items they took included a backpack containing fireworks that had been "opened and emptied of powder," according to the affidavit.
Kadybayev, left, poses with Dzhokhar Tsamaev in a picture taken from the social media site VK.com. The FBI released photos and video on April 18 of two men identified as Suspect 1 and Suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. They were later identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26.
Police say the dead suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is the man the FBI identified as Suspect 1. He was killed during the shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts, early April 19. He is pictured here at the 2010 New England Golden Gloves.
Boston Police released surveillance images of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at a convenience store on April 19.
The FBI tweeted this photo on April 19 and urged Watertown residents to stay indoors as they searched for the second suspect.
The FBI released photos and video on April 18 of two men it called suspects in the deadly bombings and pleaded for public help in identifying them. The men were photographed walking together near the finish line.
A man identified as Suspect 2 appeared in this photograph by bystander David Green, who took the photo after completing the Boston Marathon. Green submitted the photo to the FBI, he told Piers Morgan in an interview.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen: Many unresolved questions about how or why brothers carried out bombing
He says experience of other terrorists in the West could shed some light
Some who spent formative years in U.S. were radicalized over the Internet, he says
Bergen: Three pairs of brothers were among 19 hijackers on September 11
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad" and a director at the New America Foundation. Jennifer Rowland is a program associate at the New America Foundation.
Washington (CNN) -- We don't yet know how or why the Tsarnaev brothers, the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, decided to carry out their attacks, but a look at how their stories correlate with those of some other terrorists living in the West could provide some answers to the questions that many are now asking about them.
1. How could someone who grew up in the United States, as the younger brother did, become a terrorist?
Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who killed 13 people at Fort Hood Army Base in Texas in 2009, was born and raised in Virginia.
Peter Bergen
He self-radicalized, in part, over the Internet, which he used to reach out to the Yemen-based preacher Anwar al-Awlaki for advice about whether it is permissible for Muslim soldiers in the U.S. military to kill their comrades in the name of jihad.
Awlaki, a leader of al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, was somewhat noncommittal in his responses but did not discourage the act.
Investigators will surely be combing through the e-mail traffic of the Tsarnaev brothers to see if they either reached out to militant Islamist clerics or downloaded lectures by such clerics. They will also examine the brothers' Internet usage to see if they visited jihadist forums or downloaded propaganda from al Qaeda or other allied groups. And of course, it's possible their decision to carry out the attacks was reached without any outside influence.
Boston suspects: Immigrant dream to American nightmare
2. How do you square the multiple descriptions of the brothers as "good guys" with the fact that they plotted mass murder?
Boston bombing suspect in custody
It's worth recalling that Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the suicide attackers who bombed the London transit system in 2005 killing 52 commuters, was a beloved teacher at a primary school in the northern city of Leeds who taught children with developmental problems, and the happily married 30-year-old father of a baby daughter. Colleagues and acquaintances described Khan as a gentle, kind man.
No surprise then that we are hearing some similar positive characterizations of the brothers Tsarnaev.
3. Did the brothers have any training or practice on explosives?
It seems quite unlikely that the perpetrators would have been able to successfully set off two deadly bombs within seconds of each other without some sort of training or practice.
Bomb-making recipes certainly exist on the Internet, but actually building effective bombs is generally a skill that requires some training or practice, and even then a successful detonation is not guaranteed.

Faizal Shahzad, for instance, received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban before he constructed a bomb in an SUV that fizzled out rather than blowing up as he intended in Times Square on May 1, 2010.
The older Tsarnaev brother, Tamerlan, spent six months in Russia last year. What precisely he did there will surely be of intense interest to investigators. Could he have received some kind of bomb-training from Chechen militants who are experienced in making explosives?
Najibullah Zazi, a Pakistani-American who had also lived for many years in the United States, plotted to blow up bombs on the Manhattan subway around the eighth anniversary of 9/11. Zazi travelled to Pakistan a year before his planned attacks to learn bomb-making techniques from al Qaeda militants. Was this the kind of model that Tamerlan Tsarnaev followed?
Also, might the Tsarnaev brothers have done some kind of test runs of their explosive devices in the United States?
Opinion: Suspects' culture of migration and machismo
4. If the brothers' motivation had something to do with their Chechen heritage, how might that have played out in this case?
In the years after 9/11, dozens of young Somali-American men traveled to fight in the civil war in Somalia. Just as the Tsarnaev brothers, these Somali-Americans were first-generation Americans.
For these new Americans, the politics of their homeland can sometimes become more meaningful and important than it was for their parents who fled the chaos of their native countries for the safety of the United States, and who now want to put those conflicts behind them.
What exactly prompted the FBI to interview Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, following a tip from Russia that he was "a follower of radical Islam" and was contemplating leaving the United States to join a clandestine organization?
5. Did FBI officials make a mistake when they questioned Tamerlan, but didn't seem to further monitor him?
Maybe. This is reminiscent of the case of Major Hasan whose emails to fellow militants came to the attention of the feds before he killed his fellow soldiers at Ft. Hood, but were not followed up on.
Carlos Bledsoe, a convert to Islam, shot up a military recruiting office Little Rock, Arkansas, killing a soldier in 2009. Bledsoe was also on the radar of the feds before he travelled to Yemen. It was only after this trip to Yemen, where he linked up with an al Qaeda affiliate, that Bledsoe carried out the shooting at the recruiting office.
6. Did the brothers intend to die during the attacks or their aftermath?
It seems shocking to many that the Tsarnaev brothers might have been wearing suicide vests during their gun battle with police on Thursday night, but in reality several U.S. citizens and residents have intended to die in terrorist attacks.
Three of the young Somali-American men who traveled from Minnesota to fight in civil war in Somalia later carried out suicide attacks there.
Major Hasan undoubtedly went into his attack on a military base full of armed U.S. soldiers believing that it would be the last thing he did before he died. (That prediction did not come true. He was wounded in the attack but not killed).
The Al Qaeda recruit Zazi, who plotted to bomb the Manhattan subway in the summer of 2009, planned to die in this attack but was arrested before he could pull it off.
Analysis: Older suspect grew increasingly religious
7. Were the brothers really "lone wolves"?
Given all the mayhem the two brothers are allegedly responsible for -- two bombings that caused three deaths and some two hundred injuries at the Boston Marathon as well as the subsequent murder of a policeman at MIT -- did they have some kind of additional help?
According to Boston law enforcement officials, there is no evidence of such help and it's worth recalling that Hasan was entirely a lone wolf who nonetheless managed to kill 13 on a U.S. military base with heavy security.
8. Did the older Tsarnaev radicalize his younger brother?
Perhaps. Where there is some kind of terrorist cell there is sometimes a leader who instigates action. We saw this in the case in Lackawanna, New York where a group of Yemeni-American men who trained with al Qaeda in Afghanistan before 9/11 were radicalized by Kamal Derwish, a Yemeni American who had spent many years living in Saudi Arabia. Derwish encouraged his fellow Yemeni-Americans to travel to Afghanistan for military training.
9. How unusual is it for brothers to carry out terrorist attacks together?
More frequent than you might think. The deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history on 9/11 involved three pairs of brothers among the 19 hijackers: brothers Waleed and Wail al-Sheri, Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi and Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi.

Student says she saw teacher, alleged killer alone together before slaying
From Pamela Brown. Don Lemon and Greg Botelho, CNN
updated 7:08 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Chism "fit right in" when he saw "Blue Jasmine," theater manager says Colleen Ritzer asked Philip Chism, who'd been doodling, to stay after class, student says
Source: Ritzer was punched before being killed with a box cutter in the bathroom
Bathroom where the teacher was killed remains shut when high school reopens
Danvers, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Before 14-year-old Philip Chism allegedly killed his algebra teacher, the pair had at least one more encounter as student and teacher, a witness said.
Chism had been doodling and listening to music during Colleen Ritzer's algebra I class during the school's final period, classmate Cambria Cloutier told CNN. Creating such drawings was unusual for Chism, and when the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. Tuesday, Ritzer asked him to stay after class.
Cloutier sat two desks over from Chism, who rarely participated in class discussion but was "a really good student," she said.
While shuttling between two after-school meetings, Cloutier said, she looked into the same classroom and saw Ritzer standing by her computer and Chism sitting in a chair about 5 to 10 feet away. The teacher smiled at her, Cloutier recalled.
Chilling details emerge in teacher death
Sources: Teacher killed with box cutter
Grisly details revealed in school death Students remember 'great' teacher
Classes resume at Danvers school
At some point that afternoon, Ritzer went to a student girls' bathroom on Danvers High's second floor, as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom, a source close to the investigation said.
Chism allegedly followed her in.
The school reopened its doors Friday, as the first answers began to surface.
How was Ritzer killed? With a box cutter the suspect, Chism, had brought into school, a source close to the investigation says.
What happened to her body afterward? It was stashed in a recycling bin, rolled outside, then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern Massachusetts high school's athletic fields, adds another source. It was left there -- not buried, not even covered.
And where did the alleged killer go afterward? After changing his clothes, he went to a Wendy's fast-food restaurant and a movie, sources say, before police in a neighboring town saw him walking on a busy road under the pitch-dark sky early Wednesday.
Yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends, family and co-workers described as reserved and well-behaved -- continues to loom large.
Caring, compassionate teacher was 'brilliant ray of light'
Chism, who had moved to the Boston suburb of Danvers before the start of the school year, remains jailed without bond. A grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step: If they indict him for first- or second-degree murder, he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult, based on Massachusetts law.
Meanwhile, the tight-knit North Shore community is still trying to make sense of what he allegedly did and of life without a teacher who so many appreciated, learned from and loved.
"It's just surreal how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted every day," said Danvers High student Chris Weimert. Ritzer was "the nicest teacher you could ever have. I can't believe it."
There will be a wake for Ritzer at St. Augustine Church in Andover on Sunday, and her funeral will take place there Monday.
A member of the Ritzer family, who declined to be named, said the family is "doing as well as can be expected."
Two missing-persons reports come together
Students and colleagues described the 24-year-old Ritzer as someone who gave everything for her students -- be it a pat on the back, a sensible explanation to a tricky concept, or the time, effort and heart to work through problems, math or otherwise, with them.
Teen charged with death of math teacher Friend remembers slain teacher
Prosecutor: Blood was found in bathroom
Student: Teacher's death is 'surreal'
One of those students was Chism, a freshman.
Sometime after Ritzer held him back after class, she was killed in the bathroom.
There, Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m., said a source.
Her body went into a recycling bin, then outside the school where it was tossed. Authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment about 100 feet away from Ritzer's body, a source said.
Before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they'd started looking for Chism.
This was in the early evening, with Danvers Police tweeting to residents that he hadn't returned home and was last seen around the Hollywood Hits movie theater in the town about 20 miles northeast of Boston.
Scott Przybycien, the theater's manager, told CNN that Chism arrived around 4:15 p.m. Tuesday and caught the start of the Woody Allen film, "Blue Jasmine," about 15 minutes later. Surveillance video, which was turned over to police, confirmed that Chism was there until the movie let out around 6:15 p.m., he said.
"He fit right in like a normal, everyday person," Przybycien said Friday, noting that teen paid cash for his ticket and had on clean clothes.
While they were looking for him, police got a call around 11:20 p.m. Tuesday about another missing person: Ritzer. She wasn't home either, nor had she answered her phones.
The stories started coming together about an hour later, when police officers in nearby Topsfield found Chism walking along Route 1.
Whatever he told detectives in his subsequent interviews, whatever they saw in surveillance footage from the school, led to Chism's arrest for murder. It also led them to Ritzer's body in the woods.
Read the complaint
A quiet and normal student
Chism is a quiet young man, those who know him said. He excelled at soccer and made a harmless impression.
"He ... seemed quiet and reserved, but he just seemed normal," said Ariana Edwards, who was in Chism's English class.
Chism didn't drink or do drugs, and he came from a good family, one of his closest friends said. He described Chism as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people, adding that he hadn't been acting strangely lately.
Friends got their first hint that something was awry when Chism didn't show up for soccer practice Tuesday. The team set out to look for him after seeing texts that he was missing.
He was a newcomer to Danvers, a town of about 26,000 people. His family had bounced around, and he had lived in different cities in Tennessee and Florida since he was in fourth grade, authorities in those states said.
Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying
A teacher who went the extra mile
Meanwhile, many were at a loss in Danvers to explain the death of Ritzer -- a woman who inspired many, whether it be in the classroom or online, with her heart, intellect and positive spirit.
"She was talking on Saturday about this year was a good year. She was teaching freshmen for the first time. She was happy," said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. "I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought."
Sympathy spread through the region, making its way into the baseball World Series. Bleachers full of fans who had assembled to watch the Boston Red Sox take on the St. Louis Cardinals observed a moment of silence in Ritzer's honor before Game 1 began Wednesday night at Boston's Fenway Park.
Ritzer, a 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school.
"She was energetic, she was compassionate," Dzerkacz said. "You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."
Salem State issued a statement lamenting Ritzer's death.
"She believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals," the university said. "In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to 'helping students in times of need.' "
Ritzer was known to take to Twitter to dole out homework assignments and wisdom to her students.
"No matter what happens in life, be good to people," she wrote in August. "Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind."

Amazon's drone delivery: How would it work?
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 5:56 PM EST, Mon December 2, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Amazon Prime Air would use unmanned flying vehicles for delivering packages
CEO Jeff Bezos says drone deliveries are at least a few years away
Drone expert thinks approval will be easier outside the United States
Weather, safety and battery life all will have to be addressed
(CNN) -- Imaginations everywhere have been stoked since Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced his company plans to start offering 30-minute deliveries via drone-like "octocopters."
What's not fascinating about a near future in which fleets of whirring sky robots can drop our every impulse buy on our doorstep faster than we can get Chinese delivered? (You know, aside from accidental strayings into restricted air space or the rise of the machines.)
But when Bezos took to "60 Minutes" on Sunday to introduce the world to Amazon Prime Air, his idea prompted more questions than it provided answers.
So how close are we, really, to door-to-door drones becoming a reality? And how would they work?
This Amazon video shows a drone picking up a package at a warehouse.
We reached out to Amazon, where official details are still scarce, and chatted with drone expert Missy Cummings, an associate professor at MIT and one of the Navy's first female fighter pilots. Here's some of what we've been able to piece together on a project that Amazon says is, at the very least, a couple of years away from takeoff.
Could drones really be delivering packages by 2015?
That's what Bezos said is the best possible scenario. But Cummings, a longtime advocate for the commercial use of drones, thinks that's optimistic.
The Federal Aviation Administration needs to sign off on Amazon's flight plans, and Cummings says the agency hasn't been quick to move on the domestic use of drones.
"I think they (Amazon) are stepping out in a typically naive way, (but) maybe they have some secret insight to the FAA that I don't have," she said.
Cummings predicts the company will get approval to start Prime Air in other countries before the United States, but she says that having a retail and technology giant like Amazon pushing for it could speed things up for everyone.
"I don't want anybody to think this is right around the corner," Bezos warned during the "60 Minutes" interview.
How will I know if I'm eligible for a drone visit?
Bezos said the octocopters will have a 10-mile radius. So, it's likely that folks in big cities near Amazon distribution sites would be a lot more likely to qualify than those in more remote areas.
He says they'll initially carry items up to five pounds, which is roughly 86% of all deliveries Amazon makes.
The best Twitter jokes about Amazon's drones
But for even that 10-mile range to work, Amazon better be onto something about battery life that the rest of us don't know. Cummings said drones the size of the octocopters have a battery life of about 30 minutes, and the weight of their cargo could make that even shorter.
What will keep people from shooting them down?
OK, it's perhaps a little off-topic. But every single conversation we've had about the Amazon drones has, at some point, ended up focused on the innate human desire to knock stuff out of the sky, preferably with a loud bang.
Cummings joked about producing a reality show in which marksmen from different states compete to see how many octocopter targets they can bag. At least, we're pretty sure it was a joke.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Amazon doesn't directly address its drones becoming high-tech clay pigeons in a statement about safety.
"The FAA is actively working on rules and an approach for unmanned aerial vehicles that will prioritize public safety. Safety will be our top priority, and our vehicles will be built with multiple redundancies and designed to commercial aviation standards," the statement reads.
But Cummings says it's a real issue.
"It's not just people who hate drones," she said. "It's people who want those packages."
She speculated the drones will need to fly at an altitude of at least 300 feet for as long as possible to avoid attracting pot shots from target shooters or thieves. She also envisions safe "drop spots," at least at first, instead of delivery to any address within range.
"There are lots of details that need to be worked out, but nothing that is technologically overwhelming," she said.
Will the drones work when the weather is bad?
Amazon's official statement doesn't address this obvious question. But Cummings says that to make the drones reliable in most weather conditions, Amazon would need to improve on currently available technology.
"They can fly in some precipitation, but certainly not heavy precipitation," she said. "Sleet or snow ... would obscure some of the sensors. It's hard to make it a really solid business if the weather holds you back. They're going to have to work on that."
What could come next?
Amazon isn't the only company at least toying with the idea of using unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes. Domino's posted video of the "DomiCopter" delivering two pizzas in the United Kingdom earlier this year. In June, the Burrito Bomber, the creation of a couple of engineers from Yelp, demoed its ability to fly that tasty treat to your doorstep as well.
And in Australia, Zookal, a textbook company, is already using drones for deliveries.
Cummings hopes that's all just the beginning. Using drones for beneficial civic or commercial purposes, instead of military actions, is a growing trend.
"Medical supplies, wildlife monitoring, cargo, firefighting -- it's a pretty long list of things that drones can do," she said. "It's reinvigorating a dying aerospace industry."
