CNN Student News One-Sheet: Campaign FinanceStory Highlights Use this information to teach your students about campaign financeNext Article in Living » Read VIDEO (CNN Student News) -- Use this information to teach your students about campaign finance. Introduction Presidential campaigns cost a lot of money. They go through millions of dollars in a fierce competition for votes, but campaigns have to raise money in order to spend it. Politicians have not reigned in the costs of campaigning, but they have created reforms to regulate the process. Why does money matter? During a presidential campaign, candidates may spend money on television and radio advertising, polls, mailed flyers, yard signs and other campaign expenses. In 12 of the past 16 presidential contests in both parties, the candidate who raised the most money by the start of the election year went on to win the nomination. In the 2004 presidential election, candidates John Kerry and George Bush each raised and spent more than $200 million. Where do campaigns get their money? Most candidates pay for their campaigns by asking supporters to donate money. Candidates are also allowed to spend an unlimited amount of their own money. In presidential campaigns, candidates who meet certain requirements are eligible to receive federal money to help pay for their campaigns. This is referred to as "public funding" or "public financing." Under rules for this program, candidates must agree to limit spending from personal funds. American citizens, and political action committees can contribute to a candidate's campaign fund, but foreign nationals, national banks, corporations and labor unions may not. In 2008, individual donors may contribute up to $2,300 to a candidate's campaign during the primaries and, if the candidate decides not to accept taxpayer-financed public funding, another $2,300 for the general election. What laws govern campaign finances? In the early 20th century, President Theodore Roosevelt called for legislation restricting corporate contributions for political purposes. In 1971, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act, which laid down new rules for campaign contributions. After serious financial transgressions occurred during the 1972 presidential campaign, Congress reformed this legislation and created a body to enforce the rules: the Federal Election Commission (FEC). In 2002, President Bush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, also known as the McCain-Feingold Act. The BCRA increased the limits on "hard money," which is a direct contribution to a candidate that is regulated by federal law. It also allowed this limit to increase with inflation every year. Since the BCRA became law, "soft money," or funds that are not regulated by the federal government and that are intended to influence the outcome of an election, is no longer allowed to be donated to national political parties. What is the FEC? The FEC is a nonpartisan commission established by Congress to regulate campaign finances. The FEC has three main roles: Keep tabs on money used to pay for federal elections; Make sure candidates publicly disclose where their money comes from; Regulate public cash used to pay for campaigns. What is a political action committee? A political action committee is an organization that represents a specific ideological, business or labor interest group. Businesses and unions can't give money directly to a political candidate, but political action committees, or PACs, offer these groups the opportunity to participate in a political campaign. The FEC limits the amount of money PACs can contribute to any one candidate, and it also requires them to disclose a list of their donors and declare how much money they raise and spend. What happens to campaign funds when the campaign ends? Candidates may not use any funds raised during a campaign for personal use, even after the campaign is over. Any funds raised for the general election must be returned to the donors. However, if a candidate drops out of a primary race, he or she may return the donations or keep them in a campaign account indefinitely. These candidates can also distribute the raised funds to: Pay off campaign debts; Fund a future federal campaign; Make contributions to other campaign committees and political parties; Donate to charity.

Lufthansa strike threatens global painBy Kevin Voigt, CNN Lufthansa pilots to walk outSTORY HIGHLIGHTS The strike by Lufthansa pilots is scheduled to start Monday The union says it's a pay and conditions issue The company says the union is trying to interfere in management decisions Lufthansa flies to 80 countries with its main hub being Frankfurt, Germany RELATED TOPICS
Air Travel
Lufthansa AG
CNN -- A four-day strike by the pilots' union of Lufthansa threatens one of the world's largest airlines and may disrupt travel on more than two dozen partner airlines on Monday. Lufthansa and the pilot's union, Vereinigung Cockpit, are holding talks this weekend as a last ditch effort to avoid the strike. More than 4,000 pilots are expected to walk off the job at midnight Monday (6 p.m. Sunday ET) through Thursday over protracted contract negotiations centering around pay and job security. The industrial action starts the same day that British Airways cabin staff are expected to announce the outcome of its strike vote. And on Wednesday in Greece, a mass public and private sector strike is being planned to protest the government's austerity plan. Lufthansa has already canceled two-thirds of its scheduled flights Monday to Thursday ahead of the strike. Company officials admitted it would have a "heavy influence" on its international operations, which includes flights to 80 countries worldwide. Send your views and experiences to CNN iReport In 2008, Lufthansa was the number two international carrier by passengers with 42.2 million, according to the International Air Transport Association. The threatened walkout comes as the airline industry is digging out of the worst one-year drop-off in flights, according to IATA. In 2009, revenues dropped nearly 15 percent worldwide after generating a record $535 billion the previous year. Passenger travel fell a record 3.5 percent and freight fell more than 10 percent, according to IATA figures. Lufthansa officials said at a news conference Thursday it would cost the airline about $33 million a day. Many of Lufthansa's pilots have been working without a contract since March and more than 90 percent of the union's members voted to strike, said Jorg Handwerg, a pilot and representative for the union. The union sought a 6.4 percent pay increase. The union is also concerned with the airline's recent buying spree of small regional carriers, such as BMI and Austrian Airlines which, it says, is cannibalizing flights away from union-flown routes. "We fly less hours and have less potential for (performance-related bonuses)," Handwerg said. "We want to have the opportunity to grow, but instead it shrinks." In a statement, Lufthansa said: "In addition to demands on job security, however, the union also insisted on a greater say on fundamental entrepreneurial issues, equating to intervention in business management at the airline. That demand cannot be accepted." The airline is allowing passengers to rebook flights for tickets purchased before February 18 and plans to give German domestic passengers rail vouchers. But one Lufthansa passenger said she is having trouble reaching a compromise with the airline. "I spent several hours on the phone with Lufthansa to try and figure out what I can do, but now I've been told that I can't even get a refund," said Ruth Winblad, who is supposed to fly Monday from Gothenburg, Sweden, to Rome, Italy. Lufthansa is one of the largest carriers on Star Alliance, a network of 26 airlines that share ticketing and routes for international travel. Travelers on Star Alliance flights are advised to check their tickets for Lufthansa flights and contact their carrier about any potential changes, said Markus Ruediger, Star Alliance spokesman. Star Alliance member airlines are: Adria, Air Canada, Air China, Air New Zealand, ANA, Asiana Airlines, Austrian, Blue 1, BMI, Brussels Airlines, Continental Airlines, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Lot Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Spanair, Swiss, Tap Portugal, Thai Airlines, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines and U.S. Airways. Partner airlines are preparing for the potential strike. "Some of our codeshare flights with Lufthansa may be affected during the period of the strike. We are in contact with Lufthansa and will be informed of the affected flights as soon as details are made available," said Nicholas Ionides, Singapore Airlines spokesman. "Should there be customers traveling on affected Lufthansa-operated codeshare flights, they will be contacted and re-accommodated on the best next available schedule."

Silvio Berlusconi's colorful career drawing to an end?
By Peter Wilkinson and Paul Armstrong, CNN
updated 10:59 AM EST, Tue November 8, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Speculation grows that Silvio Berlusconi's colorful career is drawing to close
Berlusconi dogged by many scandals since he entered politics two decades ago
He was cleared of tax fraud, but faces charges of paying for sex with under-age girls
Economists say Berlusconi commanded insufficient political authority amid crisis
(CNN) -- In an era of bland technocratic leaders, Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi always stands out. Massively rich, charming and outspoken, and not a little vain, he has long been a compelling presence on the world stage. But speculation is now growing that his career is drawing to a close.
Until recently, Berlusconi was leading a charmed life. His vast business empire spanned media, construction and football, making him the 118th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $6.2 billion, while this year he become Italy's longest serving post-war prime minister. Then Berlusconi became embroiled in charges that he had paid for sex with a 17-year-old girl; his coalition government became ever more fragile, and Europe's financial crisis threatened to embroil Italy.
Despite the many scandals that have dogged Berlusconi since he entered politics nearly two decades ago, the 75-year-old is undisputedly one of life's survivors. Despite facing numerous trials, no charge against him has ever been proven in court; in parliament opponents have tabled 51 confidence votes in him in the last three years alone, but Italians have thrice elected him as prime minister.
Born in Milan in 1936, Berlusconi gave notice early on of his showman side by working as a lounge room crooner aboard a cruise ship to help fund his university tuition -- he studied law.

How Italy impacts eurozone
Various low-level commercial enterprises followed before the fledgling entrepreneur enjoyed his first real success in property development in the late 1960s when he was involved in a project to build Milano Two -- nearly 4,000 flats -- outside Milan.
After amassing a fortune from his growing property portfolio in the 1970s, he diversified his interests by setting up a TV cable company, Telemilano, and buying two other cable channels in an effort to break the national TV monopoly in Italy. In 1978 these channels were incorporated into his newly-formed Fininvest group, which also included department stores, insurance companies and even AC Milan -- one of the world's biggest football clubs.
Berlusconi turned his attention to politics in 1993 when he formed the center-right Forza Italia Party and the following year he was elected as prime minister after a snap election. However a dispute with his right-wing coalition partners from the Northern League Party, as well as an indictment for alleged tax fraud, brought Berlusconi's tenure to an end barely seven months into the job. He was acquitted on appeal in 2000 after the statute of limitations -- which sets a time limit on bringing legal action -- had expired.
Q&A: Silvio Berlusconi's legal woes
Berlusconi in quotes
On plan to send troops to police Sardinia's streets: "We would have to send as many soldiers as there are beautiful girls."
To those made homeless in 2009 earthquake: "They should see it like a weekend of camping."
On Barack Obama: "He's young, handsome and tanned."
And on himself: I feel like "the Jesus Christ of Italian politics. I'm a patient victim. I put up with everything. I sacrifice myself for everyone."
After defeat in the 1996 election to political nemesis Romano Prodi, he was embroiled in other financial scandals, including a charge of bribing tax inspectors. He denied any wrongdoing and was cleared again on appeal in 2000.
His fortunes turned again in 2001 when he was sworn in as prime minister for a second time. But Prodi -- a former European Commission President -- ended Berlusconi's more successful reign with his center-left Union coalition victory in 2006. At that time, the tycoon had presided over the longest-serving post-war Italian government.
Despite having a pacemaker fitted to regulate his heartbeat after he collapsed during a political rally, he refused to slow down. He had a much talked about hair transplant and cosmetic surgery - and a tanned Berlusconi was back in power for a third time in 2008 under the banner of the newly-created People of Freedom party.
The next 12 months proved to be a year of extremes for the veteran politician. He was praised for his handling of the devastating earthquake which struck the Italian town of L'Aquila in April, 2009, and even survived criticism after urging survivors to see their plight like "a weekend of camping."
But the following month Berlusconi's second wife, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce -- claiming Berlusconi had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old aspiring model whose birthday party he had attended. Berlusconi said she was the daughter of a friend and that he had done nothing wrong.
In December that year, Berlusconi was hit in the face with a replica of Milan's cathedral at a campaign rally, breaking several of his teeth and fracturing his nose. Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the irrepressible Berlusconi continued to shake hands with supporters for "a couple of minutes" after being hit.
Meanwhile Italian prosecutors expanded their tax fraud investigation into the country's biggest commercial broadcaster, Mediaset, which Berlusconi controls. He was accused of reducing Mediaset's tax liabilities by purchasing U.S. movie rights at inflated prices and then creating illegal slush funds, but last month he was cleared of all charges.
With the country's economy reeling amid the financial crisis -- Italy's debts of $2.7 trillion equal about 150% of its economic output -- pressure on Berlusconi grew. Gianfranco Fini -- a former party ally -- lashed out, accusing him of a lack of attention to the economy and structural reforms that Italy needs. The PM survived three votes of confidence in parliament during 2010 and this year, winning one by just three votes, but his authority continued to drain away.
Economists said Berlusconi commanded insufficient political authority to push through spending cuts or the moral high ground to squeeze more taxes out of Italians while he faced trial on various charges. Other European leaders criticized him for failing to implement a serious economic reform program with sufficient urgency.
Economists' faith in Berlusconi wanes
Meanwhile Berlusconi faced a serious personal challenge, and one that could yet land him in prison, with charges of sex with an underage nightclub dancer and abuse of power.
Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed "Ruby the heart-stealer," say prosecutors who claim the PM abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft. El Mahroug has said she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24.
In September 2011 prosecutors submitted transcripts of approximately 100,000 pages of wiretaps, made in 2008 and 2009, to a court in Bari. The prosecutors have accused eight people of paying young women to attend so-called "bunga bunga" parties at Berlusconi's private home.
Berlusconi denied all charges and accused prosecutors of conspiring against him in a left-wing plot. "Communism never changes in Italy. There are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles," he said earlier this year.
But according to the transcripts of the calls, Berlusconi made several controversial remarks, vowing at one point to leave Italy which he described as a "shitty country" that "sickened" him. Characteristically,. When confronted with these remarks, Berlusconi laughed off this and many other gaffes, but judging by recent protests against him, many Italians would say the sentiments are entirely mutual.

Dutch teens charged in linesman's death

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Three Dutch teenagers charged with manslaughter following death of a soccer official
Assistant referee Richard Nieuwenhuizen was beaten up by three teen players
He had been officiating during an amateur game involving his club Buitenboys
The trio were arrested at their Amsterdam home on Sunday, according to reports
(CNN) -- The Netherlands is reeling from the death of a volunteer soccer official at an amateur football match over the weekend which has led to three Dutch teenagers being charged with manslaughter.
Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old -- all Amsterdam club Nieuw Sloten players -- were arrested and charged by Dutch police after the death of a 41-year-old linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen, who was beaten by players following a match against his club Buitenboys in the city of Almere.
Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing in the match when the incident occurred.
"Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old from Amsterdam, under suspicion of seriously assaulting a 41-year-old linesman of the Buitenboys from Almere, will on Thursday appear before a judge at the Almere court," the prosecutor's office said.
"The suspects will appear on charges of manslaughter, assault and public violence."
The judge will now decide whether to keep the three youths in detention in Amsterdam.
Nieuwenhuizen is the second man to die during an amateur football game following the death of a 77-year-old, who was the victim of a karate kick by a 32-year-old footballer during a game on December 3 2011.
At a press conference, Bernard Fransen, president of KNVB amateur football, said he was "very shocked" by the tragic incident.
"Amateur football matches will be canceled this weekend and a minute's silence will be observed during professional football matches," he told reporters.
Nieuwenhuizen's death has resonated across the globe with FIFA president Sepp Blatter extending his condolences.
"Football is a mirror of society and sadly, the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game," said Blatter, according to a statement on fifa.com.
"Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs."
On its website Nieuw Sloten said it was "deeply shocked" by Nieuwenhuizen's death, adding that it would ban for life the players found to be responsible, as well pulling its team from the league and temporarily suspending all operations as a club.
"Violence should not be on the football fields," said a statement on the Nieuw Sloten website.
"And certainly not against referees, linesmen and all those others who volunteer each year to help over a million amateur footballers. We must do everything possible to eliminate these excesses.
Nieuwenhuizen was pronounced dead at 5.30 p.m. local time on Monday in the hospital of Nieuwegein, according to his club Buitenboys.
"Buitenboys wish the family much strength with this loss," said the Buitenboys website.
"The Dutch Football Association is deeply shocked. After intervention of the police and the arrival of an ambulance, he was in critical condition and transported to a hospital. There he died Monday afternoon," reported the website of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). The KNVB's director of amateur football, Anton Binnenmars, added: "Let me, on behalf of the entire KNVB and all its members, offer my sympathy to the families and friends of the victim. It is outrageous that someone enjoying a hobby can be victim of such aggression."
Despite a population of 17.5 million, Holland has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years, with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country's professional clubs.
All amateur football has been cancelled this weekend in Holland.

School's transgender ruling: fairness or discrimination?
By Josh Levs. Ed Payne and Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 6:10 AM EST, Fri March 1, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"They're punishing a 6-year-old for something that hasn't happened," the mother says
The school's accommodation offer "would stigmatize her," her father says The school district says its decision is reasonable and fair
When "his male genitals develop," some will likely feel uncomfortable, the school says
(CNN) -- A Colorado school's ruling over a transgender child has sparked questions that could affect schools all over the country.
Which bathroom should be used by a child who identifies as a different gender from his or her body? Where's the line between accommodation and discrimination? At what point is a child old enough for that to even be an issue?
The case focuses on Coy Mathis, a 6-year-old born with a boy's body. She identifies as a girl, and her family is raising her as a girl.
In kindergarten, she used the girl's bathroom with no problem, the family says. But this year, with Coy in first grade, the principal called to set up a meeting to discuss bathroom use. In advance of the meeting, the family asked what the policies are.

"We were told that there were no written policies and that the options would be for Coy to use the boys' restroom or the staff bathroom or the nurse's bathroom for the sick children, which were both on the opposite end of the building," Coy's father, Jeremy Mathis, said on CNN's "Starting Point" on Thursday.
That "would stigmatize her, having to be the only one having to go to a different bathroom, so we weren't OK with that."
The family contacted the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. When an attorney with that group could not work something out with the school, the group filed a state civil rights complaint on the family's behalf.
In the meantime, Coy is being home schooled -- partly because her parents fear bullies may make fun of her.
"The district firmly believes it has acted reasonably and fairly with respect to this issue," the school district's attorney, W. Kelly Dude, said in a written statement. "However, the district believes the appropriate and proper forum for discussing the issues identified in the charge is through the Division of Civil Rights process. The district is preparing a response to the charge which it will submit to the division. Therefore, the district will not comment further on this matter out of respect for the process which the parents have initiated."
The school calls Coy a girl as the family wishes, Dude said.
Being transgender no longer a mental 'disorder' in diagnostic manual
When "his male genitals develop ..."
The school laid out some of its argument in a letter to the Mathis family's attorney in December:
The district "took into account not only Coy, but other students in the building, their parents and the future impact a boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew older," the letter said.
"As Coy grows older and his male genitals develop along with the rest of his body," it said, "at least some parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his continued use of the girls' restroom."
Kathryn Mathis, Coy's mother, rejects that explanation. "The immediate problem with that is we're not in middle school yet, we're not in high school yet," she said Thursday. "And they're punishing a 6-year-old for something that hasn't happened and may not happen.
"Her body development is none of their business. That is up to her and her doctors in the future. That's not something that we're at right now. And right now we need to be protecting a 6-year-old, not a middle-schooler or a high-schooler."
Coy sat with her parents during the interview with CNN.
Frat pays for brother's sex change
What establishes discrimination?
Colorado law prohibits "discrimination in employment, housing and places of public accommodations against an individual based upon actual or perceived sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is defined as heterosexuality, homosexuality (lesbian or gay), bisexuality, and transgender status. Transgender status means a gender identity or gender expression that differs from societal expectations based on gender assigned at birth."
It does not explicitly state that a transgender individual should be allowed to use a bathroom for people of the gender with which that individual identifies.
Dude, the Colorado school district's attorney, has said there is no such requirement for public schools.
But Jeremy Mathis told CNN he believes "the wording of the law is very solid, and I believe that they're in direct violation of it. They are, in fact, discriminating."
"Forcing her to use a separate bathroom from all the rest of the kids or forcing a little girl to go into he boys' room," he said, is "not OK."
Coy's case will be the first to challenge a restroom restriction under the state's anti-discrimination act, the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund said.
Coy's passport and state-issued identification recognize her as female.
"For many transgender people, discrimination is a daily part of life," says Michael Silverman, an attorney with the fund. "Unfortunately for Coy, it has started very early."
"The world is going to be looking at the school," he said, adding that the case can "send a message to the world and teach tolerance, fair play and equal rights."
Transgender kids: Painful quest to be who they are
A little-studied group
Transgender children experience a disconnect between their sex, which is based on their anatomy, and their gender, which includes behaviors, roles and activities, experts say.
For the general public, transgender identity may be a new concept, though many might recall Chaz Bono, the child of entertainers Sonny and Cher. Born female, Bono underwent a transition in his 40s to become a man. He wrote in his book "Transition" that, even as a child, he had been "aware of a part of me that did not fit."
He appeared last year as a man on "Dancing with the Stars," in part, he said, to destigmatize being transgender.
Gender nonconformity is not a disorder, world group says
Comprehensive data and studies about transgender children are rare. International studies have estimated that anywhere from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000 people are transgender.
Some children as young as age 3 show early signs of gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder, mental health experts who work with transgender children say.
These children are not intersex -- they do not have a physical disorder or malformation of their sexual organs. The gender issue exists in the brain, though experts do not agree on whether it's psychologically or physiologically based.
Many transgender people report feeling discomfort with their gender as early as they can remember.
Transgender job seekers face uphill battle
Gender identity is often confused with sexual orientation. The difference is that "gender identity is who you are, and sexual orientation is who you want to have sex with," said Dr. Johanna Olson, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Southern California, who treats transgender children.
Children around age 3 are probably not interested in sexual orientation, she said. But experts say some children who look like they will be transgender in early childhood turn out to be gay, lesbian or bisexual.
School policies toward transgender students vary across the United States.
In New York, for example, the law says students can't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity.
But in Maine, a court ruled in November that a school district did not violate a transgender student's rights when she was told she couldn't use the girls' bathroom.
Girl Scouts accept transgender kid, provoking cookie boycott
Reaction to Coy's story
CNN's online audience has responded to this story with a range of questions and comments, with many insisting the child is too young to comprehend gender differences. Mostly, posters said they felt sorrow for Coy as a child who is struggling.
"Just let the kid use the gender-neutral bathrooms. When he/she is a teen, if he is still convinced he is a girl, maybe then you can get into it with the school," said commenter EDM.
"This kid is going to have a hard enough life if he really is transsexual, why start fighting battles now, when he should just be blissfully ignorant"?
Transgender teacher sues school for alleged discrimination
Commenter AlawJ said the story left a "negative impression of the parents."
"My rash view may be unfair, but I remember being that age and have helped raise 9 nieces and nephews. One wanted to be a firetruck and ran around making truck noises. Another one of the boys liked to play dress up with the girls," AlawJ wrote. "My fiance's little brother always wore dresses as well. But, at the end of the day, the parents are there to be the adults and make decisions for them.
"I also am a little weary when you read a story where the parents are filing lawsuits for their 6 year old child's rights."
CNN's Cristy Lenz and Madison Park contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Members of Congress will get to weigh in on prospect of attacking Syria
David Frum says backers of the assault should weigh four questions carefully
What will it accomplish? What comes next after the raid?
Frum: The costs may be higher than many realize and it may not be the only solution
Editor's note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, "Patriots," and a post-election e-book, "Why Romney Lost." Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002.
(CNN) -- Members of Congress demanded that President Barack Obama consult with them on Syria. They just got their wish. The responsibility for Syria policy will now be shared. Here are four questions that might be weighed wisely before the missiles fly:
1. What will it accomplish?
A war between Bashar al-Assad's regime, Hezbollah and Iran on one side and al Qaeda-style Islamic radicals on the other is a fight in which the United States has no dog. David Frum
Hurting the Assad regime inevitably means helping the rebels. True, some of the rebels are nicer than other rebels. It's also true that the nasty rebels are the faction likelier to dominate if the Assad regime falls.
In June, the nasty rebels and the nicer rebels came to violence over control of strategic checkpoints in northern Syria. The conflict ended with the nasty rebels assassinating one of the top leaders of the nicer rebels and consolidating control over the disputed territory. So much of the debate about Syria is a debate about "how"? We are in real danger of skipping over the more important questions: "Why?" and "For whose benefit?"
Opinion: The only road to peace in Syria
On Syria, Obama faces uphill battle
King: Obama made a terrible mistake
Will GOP opposition galvanize Dems on Syria?
2. What comes next? A two-day barrage of cruise missiles will not tip the balance of the Syrian civil war against the Assad regime. It took seven months of bombing plus substantial military assistance to Libyan rebels to topple Moammar Gadhafi's friendless regime. Al-Assad has a tighter grip on power and more international allies.
Odds are that after the boom-boom ceases, the civil war will resume. Syrian government forces will likely continue to commit atrocities (although maybe next time by some means other than poison gas). The rebels will very likely continue to lose. The world will have watched the Assad regime shake off an American punch -- and all the questions we face today about U.S. "credibility" will revive in more intense form.
The United States is contemplating cruise missile strikes today in large part because of the failure of prior interventions on behalf of the rebels: first food and medical aid, then communications devices and other battlefield support, then small arms. If this intervention fails to force al-Assad to quit, the next intervention will have to be bigger again.
Opinion: Syria a distraction from real U.S. challenges
3. What will it cost?
A Syria campaign is being advertised as comparatively cheap in money and American lives. We're promised "no boots on the ground." But there's another cost in danger of being overlooked: the opportunity cost.
The president, the secretary of state, the secretary of defense and other top officials have only so much time and energy. If they commit to resolving the Syrian civil war, inevitably they give second shrift, or third shrift, or worse to many other concerns of arguably greater importance to the region and the world. Egypt, for example, seems to be heading toward the same civil strife as Syria. Who is developing the plan for helping to prevent that outcome? How much high-level support and attention are they getting?
Opinion: On Syria, Obama must show strong grip
4. Is there another way?
Obama administration officials argue a strike against Syria will deter Iran. But firing cruise missiles at army facilities in Syria seems a very roundabout method of stopping a nuclear program in Iran. Some may hope that the United States is drawing Iran into a protracted, expensive proxy war. But the United States already has two anti-Iran proxy wars in inventory, Afghanistan and Iraq, and neither has gone well. What has gone well, by contrast, is the U.S. campaign of economic pressure on Iran. Who would have dared predict in 2002 that Iran would still lack a nuclear weapon 11 years later and without a U.S. military attack? Yet so it has happened. Opinion: A U.S. strike would be self-wounding
There is a lesson contained in that success, and it is: "priorities, people."
If you want to deal with Iran, deal with Iran. And if you want not to be drawn all the way into a Syrian civil war between factions none of them friendly to the United States, then the best way to avoid being drawn is: don't take the first step. And if you have already inadvisedly taken the first step, at least beware the second, third and fourth.

Serena Williams rebuffs Li Na's challenge to finish 2013 in style
updated 3:16 PM EDT, Sun October 27, 2013
A relieved Serena Williams lifts the WTA Championship title aloft after beating Li Na in a three set final.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Serena Williams wins 2013 WTA Championships
Fights off strong challenge from China's Li Na
Top seed Williams wins 2-6 6-3 6-0
78th career title for American superstar
(CNN) -- An exhausted but elated Serena Williams was left celebrating her 11th title of the season to round off 2013 by claiming the WTA Championships in Istanbul Sunday.
The World No.1 dug deep from a set down and three all in the second against China's Li Na to reel off nine straight games to clinch the prestigious title, 2-6 6-3 6-0.
"I can't believe I won. I was so tired. Honestly, did I really win? Because she played so well," Williams said in her post match interview.
"I'm just overjoyed, to be honest," Williams added. "It's really awesome. It's such a special moment. To finish the year No.1 in the world and win this title after 40 years of the WTA, it means even more."

Serena Williams' rise to greatness
Williams had to grind out a three set semifinal win over Jelena Jankovic Saturday and fell a set down to her fourth seeded Chinese opponent in the final as the tiredness set in.
Read: Can Serena become the greatest of alltime? Williams pulled 3-0 ahead in the second set, only for Li to win three straight games to level.
A lesser player might have crumbled, but the 17-time grand slam champion took her game to another level and finished it off with her 30th winner of the match.
Victory took her prize money for the season to a record $12,385, 572 and at 32 years and one month she is the oldest winner at the end of season championship.
It was her 78th WTA career title and she shows no sign of letting up in her pursuit of records with the first grand slam of the 2014 season in Australia next January firmly in her sights
Li has also finished the season strongly, the first Chinese player to make the WTA Championships final.
She is set to move to her hightest ranking of World No.3 in the new list and showed enough in the opening set and a half to give her hope of further grand slam success to add to her 2011 French Open triumph.
