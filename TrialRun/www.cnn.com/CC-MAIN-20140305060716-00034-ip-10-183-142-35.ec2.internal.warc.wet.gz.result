WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House and Senate Democrats rallied Thursday against President Bush's plan to revamp Social Security, to show they would not let it pass without a fight.Forty-three of the 44 Democrat senators, plus Independent Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont, signed a letter to the president saying it was "immoral" to borrow more money to pay for the plan, even quoting from the New Testament to make their point."We are spending enough of our kids' money," the letter said. "Our country needs to get back to following the teachings of Romans 13:8, which says we should 'let no debt remain outstanding.' "Bush says the Social Security system is broken and will be "bankrupt" in just a few decades if it's not fixed, and he favors private investment accounts that would be funded by drawing a percentage of money out of Social Security taxes that otherwise would go to pay benefits. That would force the government to make up the shortfall by either raising taxes, which Bush says he will not do, cutting benefits, or borrowing, as much as $2 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Administration.The CBO and SSA also say the personal accounts would not stave off any of Social Security's problems. "In our view, shifting financial obligations of this magnitude to future generations is immoral, unacceptable and unsustainable," the senators' letter said."All of us are willing to work with your administration on a plan for Social Security reform that will keep the system solvent for the long term," the senators said. "But we are concerned about the fiscal crisis facing the nation."Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska was the sole Democrat not to sign the letter, although he has not indicated that he supports Bush's plan. He office has not yet been reached for comment.Many of the Democrats disagree with Bush's prediction of pending bankruptcy for Social Security as well.They point to projections by the CBO and SSA that undercut Bush's insistence that the system is in track for insolvency by midcentury."Even his own administration says if we do nothing -- which of course, we will do something just as we did when Ronald Reagan was president, and we fixed it in a bipartisan way very easily -- but even if we did nothing, it would still have enough money in there to pay everyone 70 to 80 percent of benefits," said Sen. Barbara Boxer of California.Boxer also pointed out that Bush, as a congressional candidate in Texas 27 years ago, said that Social Security would be bankrupt by 1988 if it wasn't privatized.While Senate Democrats held a symbolic gathering at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial in Washington to highlight the president who put Social Security into action, House Democrats gathered on Capitol Hill with Roosevelt's grandson, James Roosevelt.Democrats are "organized, Democrats are unified, Democrats are ready for this fight," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the crowd of about 100 on Capitol Hill.The president's plan, she said, "takes a guaranteed benefit" and turns it "into a guaranteed gamble."Pelosi was joined by Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York, who said Republicans don't "believe that our government has an obligation to take care of its people."He told the crowd that some day they would be able to tell their grandchildren that they were here to stop the president's plan to kill Social Security "dead in its tracks."The Democrats also said the president did not address other benefits covered by Social Security, such as disability payments and survivor benefits.Charlie Hogan, a 63-year-old widower from Illinois, appeared with the politicians and said his daughter was only 6 years old when his wife died and her survivor benefits are allowing her to go to high school and college.Hogan, an air-conditioning and heating expert, said he could not have made it through without those benefits, adding that Social Security is like a "backup generator.""When the income stops, this kicks in," he said.Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said FDR's "New Deal was a good deal" that's likely to become "a raw deal" for future retirees."For our children and grandchildren, it is going to be a raw deal because they won't get out what they pay in," Grassley said."Unless we do something about it, my children and grandchildren are going to be out in the cold."Bush, who laid out his plans for Social Security during Wednesday night's State of the Union address, began a two-day swing through several states Thursday morning to plug those plans. (Full story)Pelosi said the president would be met by people every step of the way who support keeping the system the way it is. (Full story)Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Dead Marine's father ordered to pay protesters' legal costsBy Emanuella Grinberg, CNN Westboro Baptist Church members picketed the funeral of Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, who died in Iraq in 2006. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFather of Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder calls order to pay legal costs "slap in the face"Westboro lawyer says order consequence of lawsuit, says money will fund protestsSnyder's family sued Westboro Baptist Church for protesting Marine's funeral in 20064th Circuit reversed judgments against Westboro in '09; high court will hear case

(CNN) -- The father of a Marine whose funeral was picketed by the Westboro Baptist Church says an order to pay the protesters' legal costs in a civil claim is nothing less than a "slap in the face." "By the court making this decision, they're not only telling me that they're taking their side, but I have to pay them money to do this to more soldiers and their families," said Albert Snyder, whose son, Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, was killed in action in Iraq in 2006. Members of the fundamentalist church based in Topeka, Kansas, appeared outside Snyder's funeral in 2006 in Westminster, Maryland, carrying signs reading "You're going to hell," "God hates you" and "Thank God for dead soldiers." Among the teachings of the church, which was founded in 1955 by pastor Fred Phelps, is the belief that God is punishing the United States for "the sin of homosexuality" through events such as soldiers' deaths. Margie Phelps, the daughter of Fred Phelps and the attorney representing the church in its appeals, also said the money that the church receives from Snyder will be used to finance demonstrations. But she also said that the order was a consequence of his decision to sue the church over the demonstration. "Mr. Snyder and his attorneys have engaged the legal system; there are some rules to that legal engagement," said Phelps, a member of Westboro who says she has participated in more than 150 protests of military funerals. "They wanted to shut down the picketing so now they're going to finance it," she said. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered that Snyder pay more than $16,000 in costs requested by Westboro for copies of motions, briefs and appendices, according to court documents. In a motion filed in October, Snyder's lawyer, who is representing him for free, asked the court to dismiss the bill of costs, or, alternatively, reduce the 50-cent fee per page or charge Snyder only for copies that were necessary to make their arguments on appeal. "We objected based upon ability to pay and the fairness of the situation," Sean Summers said. The mostly pro-forma ruling is the latest chapter in an ongoing legal saga that pits privacy rights of grieving families against the free speech rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Snyder's family sued the church and went to trial in 2007 alleging privacy invasion, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were reduced to $5 million. Westboro in 2008 appealed the case to the 4th District, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's claims that its First Amendment rights had been violated. "The protest was confined to a public area under supervision and regulation of local law enforcement and did not disrupt the church service," the circuit court opinion said. "Although reasonable people may disagree about the appropriateness of the Phelps' protest, this conduct simply does not satisfy the heavy burden required for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress under Maryland law." The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case to address issues of laws designed to protect the "sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services" as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased. The justices will be asked to address how far states and private entities such as cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket-free zones and the use of "floating buffers" to silence or restrict speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. Both Phelps and Snyder's attorney said they were surprised that the 4th District chose to weigh in on the issue of legal costs when they could have waited until after the Supreme Court hearing. Phelps believes the ruling bodes well for her side. "It is a good harbinger of the fact that the Supreme Court will remind this nation that you don't have mob rule. The fact that so many people hate these words does not mean you can silence or penalize them. That's supposed to be the great liberty that we congratulate ourselves on protecting in this nation. We strut all around the world forcing people to give all the liberties we supposedly have," she said. Phelps anticipated that a Supreme Court ruling in the church's favor would be unpopular, but she said Westboro's members viewed the potential outcome in Biblical terms. "When the Supreme Court unanimously upholds the 4th Circuit, it's going to put this country in a rage, and we will be expelled," she said. "But whenever it was time for an epic event in the Bible, the thing that happened right before is the prophets were removed from the land, and that's what's going to happen to us. ... We're going to sprint to the end of this race." Snyder claims he is unable to pay any legal costs in the case and is attempting to raise funds on his son's site, http://www.matthewsnyder.org/. He is equally optimistic that he will prevail before the Supreme Court. "The American people keep my spirits lifted a lot and give me hope. I think most of the country is on my side on this issue," he said. "Too many people have died to protect our rights and freedoms to have them degraded and spit upon like this church does." CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.

Google rolls out encrypted Web search optionBy Elinor Mills, CNET Google is the first major search engine to offer this privacy-protective feature. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google began offering an encrypted option for Web searchers on Friday "Https://www.google.com" scrambles the words and phrases you search on Secure Web search option will slow down the initial connection RELATED TOPICS
Internet
Google Inc.
(CNET) -- Google began offering an encrypted option for Web searchers on Friday and said it planned to roll it out for all of its services eventually. People who want to use the more secure search option can type "https://www.google.com" into their browser, scrambling the connection so the words and phrases they search on, and the results that Google displays, will be protected from interception. The beta service of the secure Web search option begins in the United States on Friday and will be rolled out over the next few days to users around the world, said Murali Viswanathan, a Google search product manager. Friday's announcement makes Google the first major search engine to offer this privacy-protective feature. AOL, Yahoo, and Microsoft currently do not. "Some users will want the extra privacy and security this feature will offer," Viswanathan said in an interview with CNET. "But it's not going to be the default option, at this point. There's a lot of work to be done before we get there." The encryption protects only data in transit between an individual's browser and the Google search server. When people click on a search result and are directed to another Web site, they leave the encrypted channel. Offering encrypted connections to Google.com means that users in China and other regimes that engage in significant surveillance will -- assuming the connection is not blocked in the first place -- be able to conduct searches without governments knowing the search terms. The protected Web search service will feature a customized logo that includes an icon of a lock and "SSL" which stands for Secure Sockets Layer, the technology used to encrypt the information as it travels between an individual's computer and the Google search server. The SSL technology is typically used on banking and e-commerce Web sites. Google has always offered Gmail users the ability to use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which uses SSL, in the browser. The company enabled Gmail users to set it as a persistent preference in mid-2008 and offered it as an option for Google Docs, as well. It became the default for Gmail in January. People who choose the secure option on Google will only be able to get encryption for Web searches and not for other types of searches, such as Image Search and Maps, at least for now. As a result, links for those searches will not appear on the side or top of the search page when someone is in the secure search mode. The secure Web search option will slow down the initial connection a computer makes to the Google server, but it may be hardly noticeable to most people. It also means Google will have to use more processor power to handle the scrambling and unscrambling of the SSL connection, which is the biggest reason most Web sites don't offer it as an option. The service does not protect data stored on an end user's computer or at the Google server, and if someone has malware or a keylogger on the computer, Web search data and other information could be stolen or leaked. Google announced last week that it would offer encryption for Web search soon, in the wake of the news that vehicles for capturing Google Maps Street View images had mistakenly been collecting data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks for years. But Viswanathan said the timing of the encryption announcement was completely unrelated and that Google had been working on the Web search encryption offering for a few months.	© 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

Muslim Brotherhood: 'We are not seeking power' By the CNN Wire Staff Muslim Brotherhood ready for democracySTORY HIGHLIGHTSThe Islamist umbrella group says it will work to promote democracyIt does not intend to field a candidate for the presidencyIt says the regime has been using the organization as a scarecrowIt has kept a low profile in the uprising but many question whether it will continue to do so Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Keeping with the low-profile it has adopted in Egypt's uprising, the Muslim Brotherhood said Wednesday it wants to promote democracy but does not intend to field a candidate for president. "The Muslim Brotherhood are not seeking power," Mohammed Morsi, a member of the group's media office, said at a Cairo news conference. "We want to participate, not to dominate. We will not have a presidential candidate, we want to participate and help, we are not seeking power." What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The Islamist umbrella group also sought to dispel fears that it would push for an Islamic state in a post-Hosni Mubarak era. "We reject the religious state," said Mohammed Katatny, former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc. But fears that the Muslim Brotherhood could hijack Egypt's pro-democracy movement are real. It has been expressed by foes of President Mubarak like businessman Naguib Sawiris, part of the self-proclaimed Council of the Wise, as well as Mubarak's allies abroad, including the United States.

U.S. frustrated with Egypt negotiations
The concerns were perhaps compounded by last week's remarks from Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khameni, who referred to the revolts in Egypt and other regional nations as the "Islamic awakening." But Katatny said the Brotherhood was not responsible for statements made by others. "The regime have been using the Muslim Brotherhood scarecrow to tell the world that the regime is the only one who can safeguard the country, but this is wrong and it is their way to try to ignore the people's demands." Formed in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, the revivalist Muslim Brotherhood, or al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin, is the largest and most organized opposition movement in Egypt. It is officially banned on grounds that Egypt does not recognize parties with a religious agenda and members were barred from making a bid for the presidency. But Brotherhood candidates ran as independents in the 2005 election and won 88 of 444 parliamentary seats. Those victories prompted Mubarak to amend the Egyptian constitution to further restrict candidates outside the ruling National Democratic Party to vie for parliamentary seats, a move that lent credence to the strongman's critics who have accused him of using the Brotherhood's growing influence as an excuse to crack down. Many of the Brotherhood's members have been part of the demonstrations that erupted last month -- Morsi estimated that 15 to 20 percent of the protesters were Brotherhood followers. But the group has been careful not to promote its agenda. Khaled Fahmy, the chairman of the history department at the American University in Cairo, said in an article for CNN that some of the skepticism about the group is "well-founded but much of it exaggerated." Detractors of the Brotherhood point to proclamations about using violence and that the organization does not believe in equality between Muslims and Coptic Christians or between men and women. They also connect the Brotherhood to extremist groups such as the Palestinian Hamas. Some have even suggested that militants from other nations are among the crowds in Tahrir Square. The group's spokesmen at the Wednesday news conference chuckled at the notion. "These are silly jokes," said spokesman Mohammed Beltagy. Morsi added that the idea was "an insult to all Egyptians." "This is all rubbish talk and very insulting to say that Hamas, who is locked down in Gaza, can be behind organizing the uprising in Egypt." Morsi also gave assurances that the peace treaty Egypt signed with Israel will remain intact, though he said the Brotherhood questioned why the Palestinians have yet to gain a sovereign homeland.

"Where are all these promises?" he asked. "Whether we agree or not, we need to ask what the Israelis have delivered so far. "We don't want to force our beliefs on the parliament," he said. "If the parliament approved the treaty that (former President Anwar) Sadat signed, it is still valid and will still be." Khalemy said Egyptian society must allow a place for the Brotherhood. "A group with some hundreds of thousands of members and one that controlled some 20% of the 2005 parliament cannot be excised from the Egyptian political equation," Khalemy wrote. "Doing so would only lead to its increased radicalization and militancy." But if change takes root in Egypt, many will question whether the Brotherhood will continue to practice restraint.CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this story.

Afghan shooting suspect showed different side in Iraq
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 5:31 PM EDT, Sun March 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"We ended up helping the people that ... hours before were trying to kill us," suspect said in 2009
The soldier is accused of killing 16 civilians during a rampage
Lawyer John Henry Browne questions why soldier was sent on a fourth deployment
The soldier lost part of a foot and suffered a concussion on his Iraq tours
(CNN) -- The man identified Friday by sources as the U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians betrayed no animosity toward civilians in a different war zone, according to an account posted on the U.S. Army's website that describes a firefight in Iraq in January 2007.
"I've never been more proud to be a part of this unit than that day, for the simple fact that we discriminated between the bad guys and the noncombatants and then afterward we ended up helping the people that three or four hours before were trying to kill us," says Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who was then a team leader in 1st Platoon, C Company.
"I think that's the real difference between being an American as opposed to being a bad guy, someone who puts his family in harm's way like that."

In the February 2009 article, Bales was described as a participant in an attempt by the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment to recover a helicopter that had been shot down in Iraq, killing both pilots.
The ensuing battle -- which succeeded -- left 250 Iraqis dead, 81 wounded and 410 detained; none of the 2-3 Infantry's soldiers was hurt or killed, the article says.
A number of the Iraqi casualties were civilians, and the battle's clearing operation turned into a humanitarian one, the article adds, again quoting Bales: "We'd go in, find some people that we could help, because there were a bunch of dead people we couldn't, throw them on a litter and bring them out to the casualty collection point," he is quoted as saying.
Bales, who is in his late 30s, was flown Friday to a prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He has not been identified officially, but a senior military official and a defense source both identified him to CNN. The military's policy is not to identify suspects until they have been charged.
He is accused in a weekend shooting spree in two villages in Afghanistan in which nine children, three women and four men were killed.
The circumstances regarding the incident remain unclear.
The military is investigating whether alcohol may have been a factor, senior military officials said. One of the officials said alcohol was found on the base in the area where the suspect lived. It was not clear whether the alcohol belonged to the soldier; a toxicology screening was conducted but the results have not been returned, the official said.
Prior to his deployment to Afghanistan, the soldier had lost part of a foot in Iraq and suffered a traumatic brain injury, according to his lawyer, John Henry Browne. The Seattle attorney said the screening for the concussion was minimal.
The soldier had not wanted to deploy to Afghanistan on what ultimately became his fourth combat tour, Browne said, citing conversations with the soldier's family. Bales had served three times in Iraq.
"He was told that he was not going to be redeployed," Browne said. "The family was counting on him not being redeployed. I think it would be fair to say he and the family were not happy that he was going back."
Browne painted a picture of a decorated, career soldier who joined the military after the 2001 terrorist attacks and had spent his Army life at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. Browne called him a devoted husband and father to his two young children who never made any derogatory remarks about Muslims or Afghans.
Browne said he was offended by media reports that marital discord may have played a role in the events that unfolded in Kandahar province villages near the small combat outpost where the soldier was stationed. He said those reports were "nonsense."
He also said that, the day before the slayings, another soldier on that base had his leg shot off in front of the suspect.
"That affected the whole base," Browne said.
The soldier is accused of leaving the remote outpost of Camp Belambay on foot early Sunday and heading to neighboring villages in the Panjwai district of Kandahar province, where he allegedly carried out the rampage.

Solving 'the Google problem' key to ensuring the Internet's success
By Andrew Keen, special for CNN
updated 10:44 AM EST, Thu December 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
U.S. and EU regulators met in Brussels this week to discuss "the Google problem"
They were considering whether its dominance of the search market may be illegal
Keen says they need to decide soon whether to pursue anti-trust lawsuits
He says it is important to ensure entrepreneurial innovation is allowed to flourish
Editor's note: (CNN) -- Many of Europe's leading tech entrepreneurs are meeting at the annual LeWeb conference in Paris this week to celebrate the future - an "Internet of things" governed by intelligent devices.
But, rather than Paris, the most consequential European meeting about the future of the Internet this week may have taken place in Brussels on Monday.
In contrast with the radically transparent networking culture that characterizes LeWeb, the Brussels event was a meeting between two powerful bureaucrats that took place, like all meetings between powerful bureaucrats, behind closed doors.
Andrew Keen
Jon Leibowitz, the Chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) met with Joaquin Almunia, the vice-president of the European Commission to discuss Google - the dominant company on today's Internet. Specifically, they were meeting to discuss potential FTC and EU anti-trust lawsuits against the tech giant, in an attempt to resolve the Google problem.
It's a very simple problem. The future may, indeed, have arrived on the Internet. But rather than being run by intelligent devices, it's unfortunately being run more and more by a single company -- Google, which controls over 90% of the search market in several European countries. And the problem, as both the FTC and the commission recognize, is that this dominance may, in part, be illegal.
Google has been accused in both Europe and the United States of using its dominant position in search to unfairly promote its own products and services -- from travel and shopping comparison engines to advertising and mapping.
These accusations have been well documented and extend from successful American internet companies such as Yelp, Expedia and Nextag to European start-ups like eJustice.fr and Foundem.
At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Almunia confirmed that the commission was working "intensively" on its probe of Google. Meanwhile, Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt, in a characteristically pugnacious message to Almunia and Leibowitz, told the Wall Street Journal that "it's time for them to sort of move to one resolution or another. It's not like they don't have a million documents and so forth."
Schmidt is right. Given the speed of technological change, it's time for both the commission and the FTC to decide whether or not to bring their anti-trust lawsuits against Google. The longer both Almunia and Leibowitz wait, the more powerful Google becomes, and the more indecisive and laggardly the regulators appear.
An Internet of things must be a place of all of our things, not just Google's thingsAndrew Keen
Time is, indeed, of the essence. As the future arrives on all our devices and "the Internet of things" becomes a reality, it is essential that this Google problem, which is undermining entrepreneurial innovation, is resolved.
An Internet of things must be a place of all of our things, not just Google's things. And as Google products such as its self-driving cars and data goggles pioneer this brave new world of intelligent devices, it is essential that the FTC and the commission guarantee that the ubiquitous Google search engine doesn't degenerate into a platform for this increasingly powerful company to hawk its own intelligent products and services.
Google's Eric Schmidt spoke at Le Web last year. "This particular conference is one of the best venues for new entrepreneurs in Europe," he said, rightly, of Europe's largest Internet event.
But for future entrepreneurs really to be able to innovate, we need fair search which doesn't prioritize the products and services of Google itself.
We are thus relying on Leibowitz and Almunia. Let's hope they can make a decision on whether to move ahead with their anti-trust cases by the end of the year. Let's hope they can solve the Google problem.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ghana is a country rich in history, culture and natural beauty
Mole National Park is home to more than 93 species of mammal
Elmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa
Osu, in Accra, offers visitors a vibrant nightlife
(CNN) -- Upon arrival at Kotoka International airport in Ghana's capital city Accra, you are immediately greeted by a sign that says "Akwaaba," which means "Welcome" -- and this is exactly how you will feel when visiting this beautiful West African country.
A success story of African development, democracy and stability, Ghana is a nation made up of people that are as warm as its climate. Rich in history, culture and natural beauty, it's the perfect introduction to Africa if you are a first-time traveler to the continent, or a great alternative for those who have exhausted the Safari circuit, and crave a different African experience.
There is something for everyone in Ghana, ranging from nature trails and UNESCO World Heritage sites to bustling markets, tranquil beaches and vibrant nightlife.
Wildlife
There are 15 national parks and reserves across the country. A must see is Kakum National Park, in the central region.

Reminders of the slave trade
The area is covered with stunning tropical rainforest and rare animals, and a long series of hanging bridges known as the Canopy Walkway. Not for the faint hearted, the walkway is located at the forest canopy level, and is secured by a series of nets and wires for safety. The walkway provides tourists with a spectacular vantage point of the beautiful surroundings.
Another great place to visit is Ghana's largest wildlife refuge, Mole National Park. The park is located in northwest Ghana, and the park's entrance is reached through the nearby town of Larabanga.
It is home to over 93 mammal species, with large mammals including elephants, hippos, buffalo, and warthogs. The park is considered a primary African preserve for numerous antelope species; olive baboons, black-and-white colobus monkeys and the green vervet are among the monkey species resident there. Slender-snouted and dwarf crocodiles are among the 33 known species of reptiles that call this breathtaking park home.

Heritage
The country became a major economic hub with the emergence of the slave trade, and several slave castles erected by the Europeans in 15th century remain standing.
Built by the Portuguese in 1482, Elmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has become a pilgrimage site, drawing thousands of visitors from around the world -- in particular African-Americans and Caribbean people seeking to connect with their heritage.

The town of Elmina surrounding the castle is a vibrant, robust fishing community with an incredible amount of energy and color.
Accra
If you don't want to venture far from the capital, there is a lot to do right in Accra. For beach bums, Labadi beach is perfect for soaking up the African sun, and being entertained while you do it. Drumming, cultural dancing and music can all be seen and heard on holidays and during the weekend.
Tourists can also visit local cultural attractions such as Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, W.E.B Dubois Center or head to the Arts Center, where a multitude of stalls sell crafts from all around the country.
After a day of relaxing at the beach or visiting the cultural sites, visitors can head to the upscale area of Osu, in central Accra, to sample the nightlife. Locally referred to as the "West End," Osu boasts an impressive number of local and international restaurants offering a range of cuisines.
There are also several options for club hoppers and lounge goers. One of the latest additions to nightlife in Accra is Republic Bar and Grill. With indoor and outdoor seating the bar has a retro vibe, and celebrates Ghanaian food, music, culture and art. Republic has a wonderful list of drinks, ranging from cold local beers, to exotic cocktails and herbal teas made with fresh ingredients.
The bar also serves a wonderful menu of finger foods including fried yam/cassava, kelewele (fried plantain seasoned with delicious spices) and chicken wings seasoned with local spices.

Kumasi
If Accra whets your city-touring appetite to then a trip to Kumasi is highly recommended. The five-hour bus ride from Accra is a great way to see more of the country, and the VIP coaches are cheap and comfortable, showing local movies to entertain you.
There is plenty to do upon arrival to Ghana's second-biggest city. Kumasi is home to the bustling Kejetia Market, which has more than 10,000 stores and stalls, and is said to be the biggest in West Africa. Visitors can buy a wide variety of items such as hand-crafted wooden sculptures and masks, paintings, native fabric, spices, handmade jewelry and much more.
Kumasi is also home to the National Cultural Centre, the Menhya Palace and Lake Bosumtri. The lake is the only natural lake in Ghana and the area is peaceful and tranquil. Like Accra, Kumasi also has a vibrant nightlife with restaurants and entertainment to suit all tastes.
When it comes to accomodation, Ghana offers everything from homestays to five-star accommodation. Major international chains include Golden Tulip, Novotel, Best Western and Movenpic. The Marriot, Sheraton and Hilton Hotels are set to open later in 2013.

In Turkey, U.S. soldiers guard against Syrian missile threat
By Ivan Watson and Gul Tuysuz, CNN
updated 8:26 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Close to 300 U.S. soldiers protect Gaziantep, an industrial city of 1.4 million people
They operate Patriot missile launchers and radar stations near the Syrian border
Commander: "We're protecting against" any Syrian "tactical ballistic missile or rocket attack"
Last year, at Turkey's request, U.S., Germany, Netherlands agreed to send missiles
Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) -- For the past eight months, close to 300 U.S. soldiers have stood guard on a hillside overlooking one of Turkey's largest cities, scanning the skies for the threat of missiles fired from nearby Syria.
The American men and women, wearing full battle armor and helmets under the hot September sun, operate a series of Patriot missile launchers and radar stations, designed to hunt and shoot down incoming missiles.
Middle East reconfigured: Turkey vs. Iran vs. Saudi Arabia
It is a U.S. military "boots on the ground" deployment close to the Syrian border that has been largely overlooked during the furious debate in Washington over whether to attack the Syrian regime.
"We're protecting against any tactical ballistic missile or rocket attack that may come from the country of Syria," said Lt. Col. John Dawber, commander of the Patriot missile battalion originating from Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

"Our presence here is to deter such an attack, and if that attack does come, to defeat any attack on our asset."
The "asset" is Gaziantep, a fast-growing industrial city of 1.4 million inhabitants. This sprawling metropolis is about 30 miles from the Syrian border and barely a two-hour drive from the northern Syrian battlefield city of Aleppo, which has been the target of months of Syrian government airstrikes and Scud surface-to-surface missile attacks.
Late last year, at the request of the Turkish government, the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands agreed to send three Patriot missile battalions to their NATO ally, to protect the Turkish cities of Gaziantep, Adana and Kahramanmaras.
The decision was reached after a series of deadly cross-border incidents, during which the Turkish government accused Syrian government forces of killing Turkish citizens with artillery and small arms fire.
The possibility that chemical weapons were used on a massive scale in neighborhoods around Damascus last week has only escalated the potential threat along the border, especially after the Syrian government threatened retaliation against U.S. allies Turkey, Jordan and Israel if it was targeted by an American attack.
The U.S. troops stationed in Gaziantep say surface-to-surface missiles equipped with chemical warheads are weapons the Patriot missile systems are designed to combat.
"The nature of our branch (of the military), air defense artillery, is that there is always a chemical threat," said Capt. Tarik Jones, a native of Woodbridge, Virginia.
Lt. Col. Dawber added that the Patriot missiles' ability to destroy missiles armed with chemical weapons depended on many factors, including the quantity of poison on the warhead, the type of chemical agent and weather conditions.
But, he added, "I'm pretty sure we can mitigate most of that, if not all of that, based on certain conditions."
For laymen, Jones summed up the complicated advanced technology and physics behind the Patriot system with a Nintendo video game analogy. He called the Patriots "Duck Hunt."
"We are able to engage missiles that are coming into the city, by shooting missiles out that are able to intercept it in the middle of the air," he said.
There are ample reasons why the Syrian government would want to attack Gaziantep. Tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of Syrian refugees and exiles are believed to have settled here over the past two years. It is a key operations hub for international aid efforts to northern Syria.
But Gaziantep is also an important rear base of operations for Syrian opposition groups, who are supported and, in some cases, armed by the Turkish government.
The mission of the U.S. troops deployed here is unusual because from their vantage point, they can see the city they have been assigned to protect.
"This is the first time in my 18-year career that we can see the asset that we're defending," said Dawber, who gazed past rows of Patriot missile launchers at the cityscape below.
"It's a special reward to also enjoy the view, while protecting the asset that we cover."

Undocumented immigrant lawyer speaks out
By Mariano Castillo, CNN
updated 11:18 AM EST, Fri January 3, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A California court rules that Sergio Garcia can practice law
Garcia is an undocumented immigrant
He says the ruling is a dream come true
But he won't practice immigration law, he says
(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law.
He's been waiting 19 years for a visa still stuck in a backlog, but the California Supreme Court ensured this week that his second dream will become a reality.
Garcia can be admitted to California's state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there, the court ruled.
"I'm super excited to finally be able to fulfill one of my dreams," Garcia told CNN Friday.
Court: Undocumented immigrant can be lawyer
But the case raises many questions, particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia's efforts to practice law. They question how someone who is in the country without legal status can be licensed to uphold the law as an attorney.
Garcia says that this an easy initial response to make but that looking at the details of his case, it is not so clear-cut. He was brought to the United States as a minor and has been in line for 19 years for a green card. If anyone feels frustrated the the situation, they should address it with the federal government, Garcia said.
It's the immigration system that's broken, he said.
Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old, according to court documents.
He remained there until 1986, when he and his parents returned to Mexico. Eight years later, at age 17, Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation, though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States.
That year, Garcia's father filed an immigration visa petition on his son's behalf, which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995. The visa still has not been granted, even though Garcia has lived in the state since 1994.
California's Supreme Court ruled Thursday (PDF) that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state.
Asked why he didn't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities, Garcia said law was his singular focus.
"I wasn't smart and put all my eggs into one basket," he said. "This whole idea of being an attorney was the only idea I had going, so 20 years of working on that dream, I couldn't really afford to give up on it."
"That, and I'm a little bit stubborn, anyway," Garcia added.
Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law.
"Oh, no, that's just too messed up," he said.
CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Tom Watkins contributed to this report. 0
