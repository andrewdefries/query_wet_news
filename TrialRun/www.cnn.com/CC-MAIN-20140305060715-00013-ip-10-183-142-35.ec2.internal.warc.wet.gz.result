(CNN) -- After spending 12 weeks in jail for refusing to name a source, The New York Times reporter Judith Miller testified Friday before a federal grand jury looking into a CIA leak case after her source gave her permission.Miller said she agreed to testify before the grand jury only after she received a personal letter and telephone call from her source, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, and a promise from the special investigator that her testimony would be limited to her communication between her and her source.Libby made a telephone call to Miller in prison September 19 to personally free her from the pledge of confidentiality, a move that contributed to her release, Libby's attorney, Joseph Tate of Philadelphia, told CNN."These were not form waivers," Miller said after leaving federal court in Washington. "They were not discussions among lawyers." (Watch Miller's statement -- 5:43| Text)"I testified as soon as I could," she said. "I knew what my conscience would allow."Miller did not identify the source."I am hopeful that my very long stay in jail will serve to strengthen the bond between reporters and their sources," Miller said.She did not discuss her testimony before the grand jury.New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the newspaper supported Miller's decision to testify."We are very pleased that she has finally received a direct and uncoerced waiver, by phone and in writing, releasing her from any claim of confidentiality and enabling her to testify," he said in a statement.Miller was released from a federal facility in Alexandria, Virginia, about 4 p.m. after a contempt order against her was vacated by a federal judge, a source with detailed knowledge of her case told CNN. Had refused to testifyThe chain of events that led to the contempt charges against Miller began in July 2003, when syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who is also a CNN contributor, identified Valerie Plame as a CIA operative in his column. He cited unidentified senior administration sources for the information.Plame's husband is Joe Wilson, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq. Wilson charged that his wife's name was leaked to retaliate against him after he disputed Bush administration statements that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had tried to purchase uranium in Africa.Because federal law makes it a crime to deliberately reveal the identity of a CIA operative, the Justice Department launched an investigation, headed by Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago.As part of his probe, Fitzgerald subpoenaed a number of journalists to testify about their sources, including Miller. Despite the fact that she never actually wrote a story on Plame or Wilson, Miller refused to testify about sources she developed during her reporting, and she was jailed for contempt in July.She could have been held in jail until October, when the grand jury's term will expire.New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller said that until recently, Miller had received "only a generic waiver" of her confidentiality promise, "and she believed she had ample reason to doubt it had been freely given.""In recent days, several important things have changed that convinced Judy that she was released from her obligation," Keller said in a statement. He did not provide details of what those changes were.Miller said in her statement that she would not comment until after she testifies before the grand jury.'Why didn't someone call us?'After news broke Thursday of Miller's release from prison, Tate said Libby signed a waiver of confidentiality more than a year ago and that Tate followed up with a phone call to Abrams assuring him Libby's waiver was voluntary.But Tate said Miller's attorney, Bob Bennett, told him over the Labor Day weekend that Miller did not accept that waiver because "it came from lawyers."Tate said he wondered "why didn't someone call us 80 days ago" -- before Miller entered prison.Tate said Libby has testified before the grand jury about his "conversations with Judy Miller and everyone else."While it was unclear what Libby said in his testimony, Tate said Libby "did not know the name Valerie Plame until he read it in Robert Novak's article."Tate also mentioned two Washington Post reporters, Glenn Kessler and Walter Pincus. He said both men have testified that they did not talk to Libby about the case.CNN's Kelly Wallace and Dana Bash contributed to this report. Story Tools

Bush takes blame for GOP election losses
Adjust font size:
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Wednesday took responsibility for his party's losses on Election Night and said he is willing to work with congressional Democrats on the major issues during the last two years of his presidency."I'm obviously disappointed with the outcome of the election and, as the head of the Republican Party, I share a large part of the responsibility," Bush said during a East Room news conference at the White House."I told my party's leaders that it is now our duty to put the elections behind us and work together with the Democrats and independents on the great issues facing this country." (Read a transcript of Bush's comments)On Tuesday, Democrats picked up at least 28 seats in the House of Representatives, giving them control of the chamber for the first time since the Republican sweep in the 1994 midterm elections. (Full story)Bush said he had called Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become the first female speaker of the House when the new Congress begins in January, and the Senate's Democratic leader, Harry Reid, and congratulated them on their success Tuesday night. (Pelosi ready to take House helm)On Tuesday, the Democrats picked up five seats in the Senate. The closeness of a Senate race in Virginia puts the ultimate control of the the chamber in doubt. (Full story)Citing his experience as governor of Texas, the president said he was confident he could work with the Democratic leadership to put aside differences and come up with a bipartisan way to address the country's problems. Bush said he would invite the Democratic leaders to the White House soon."The message yesterday was clear: The American people want their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, conduct ourselves in an ethical manner and work together to address the challenges facing our nation," Bush said. The president mentioned Social Security and Medicare reform, immigration, the minimum wage and U.S. dependence on foreign oil as among the issues he thought he could make progress on with congressional Democrats.Earlier Wednesday, Pelosi also said she intends to work with the president. "I told him what I said last night, that I looked forward to working in a bipartisan way with him, that the success of the president is always good for the country and I hoped that we could work together for the American people," the California lawmaker said.Bush said he could work with the Democratic leadership despite the harsh language used during the campaigns on both sides."This isn't my first rodeo. In other words, this is not the first time I've been in a campaign where people have expressed themselves in different kinds of ways," he said. "But I have learned that, you know, if you focus on the big picture -- which in this case is our nation -- and issues we need to work together on, you can get stuff done."At the news conference, Bush also announced that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is resigning and will be replaced by former CIA Director Bob Gates. Bush said the decision to replace Rumsfeld was made before the elections. (Full story)"The reason why [Rumsfeld didn't resign before Tuesday] is I didn't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign," Bush said.The president acknowledged that dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq was a major factor in his party's loses."There were different factors that determined the outcome of different races, but no question, Iraq was on people's minds," Bush said. "And, as you have just learned, I am making a change at the secretary of defense to bring a fresh perspective as to how to achieve something I think most Americans want, which is a victory.

The storyDozens of calls flooded the Omaha Police Department's 911 emergency line after a gunman opened fire inside the city's Westroads Mall, with witnesses calling in tones that ranged from almost matter-of-fact to near terror."I haven't seen anything. I'm hiding in a clothes rack," a woman said after a dispatcher asked her for a description of the shooter. "I mean, there's been like 50 gunshots."In one of the recordings, provided to CNN by the police department, a rapid burst of three gunshots can be heard, followed by two more a moment later before the line goes dead.

Ocean trash problem 'far from being solved,' U.N. saysStory Highlights New U.N. report says ocean trash is a "tremendous" problem Much of the trash is plastic, which goes away very slowly, if ever Scientists say plastic collects in large "garbage patches" in oceans One such garbage patch is said to be the size of Texas Next Article in Technology » ReadMAP By John D. Sutter CNN	(CNN) -- The world's oceans are full of trash, causing "tremendous" negative impacts on coastal life and ecology, according to a U.N. report released Monday. The oceans will continue to fill up with junk discarded from cities and boats without urgent action to address this buildup of marine debris, the United Nations Environment Programme says in a report titled "Marine Litter: A Global Challenge." Current efforts to address the problem are not working, and the issue is "far from being solved," the report says. "There is an increasingly urgent need to approach the issue of marine litter through better enforcement of laws and regulations, expanded outreach and educational campaigns, and the employment of strong economic instruments and incentives," the report says. "Although a number of countries have taken steps at the national level to deal with marine litter, the overall situation is not improving." Scientists have been watching trash pile up in the world's oceans for about a half-century, when plastics came into widespread use. Since plastics don't biodegrade, or do so very slowly, the trash tends to remain in the ocean, where circling currents collect the material in several marine "garbage patches." See a map of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch » One of these trashy areas is said to be roughly the size of Texas. The water in these at-sea landfills is thick like a plastic soup, oceanographers told CNN. Don't Miss Commentary: World's biggest fish are dying

Read the UN report on marine litter
The trash patches are located in "very remote parts of the ocean where hardly anyone goes, except the occasional research vessel," said Peter Niiler, a distinguished researcher and oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Plastics and cigarette butts are the most common types of ocean litter, with plastic making up about 80 percent of the ocean trash collected in some areas of the world, a U.N. news release says. The ocean litter is a problem for coastal communities, which rely on clean beaches for tourism dollars and to boost quality of life for their residents, the report says. Ocean trash also affects marine life and degrades human health. Sea turtles, for example, think plastic grocery bags are jellyfish when the bags are floating in the ocean. An untold number of the turtles and other creatures, such as Hawaii's endangered monk seal, swallow the bags and suffocate, drown or starve, said Holly Bamford, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's marine debris program. Birds face similar issues when they eat pieces of plastic out of the water. In the North Sea, a survey found 94 percent of fulmars, a type of seabird, had plastics in their stomachs, the U.N. report says. The birds, on average, had about 34 pieces of plastic in their stomachs. A surprising amount of trash that ends up in the ocean starts on the land, the report says. In Australia, for instance, a survey found 80 percent of ocean trash starts on the land. One of the key questions for people interested in ocean trash is how much of it is out there, but Monday's U.N. report does not solve that mystery. The U.N. says little is known about the extent of litter in the oceans, and more data is needed for the problem to be adequately addressed. "This deficiency, in combination with the lack of specific legislation, adequate law enforcement and funding, are the primary reasons why the problem of marine litter is far from being solved," the report says. "Unless effective action is taken, the global marine litter problem will only continue to worsen in the years to come." The report does suggest several solutions, among them: Countries and regions should adopt long-term plans to prevent litter from ending up in the oceans. Countries should monitor marine litter using international standards and methodologies. Ports should encourage fishing boats not to discard nets at sea. Efforts to reduce marine litter should get more funding. Volunteer efforts try to address the issue now, and the Ocean Conservancy says it organizes the largest of these. Last year, 400,000 volunteers from more than 100 countries picked up 6.8 million pounds of trash from beaches, preventing it from harming the ocean, said Tom McCann, a spokesman for the group. "It's entirely preventable," he said of the problem. "It's something we can solve ourselves." McCann said people can prevent trash from ending up in the ocean by making smarter choices about the products they buy. Some of the Ocean Conservancy's recommendations include: Buy products with smart packaging that doesn't create excess waste. Use alternatives to plastic such as cloth grocery bags and reusable bottles. Don't litter. Trash can make its way from the interior of a continent into the oceans via rivers and the wind. Volunteer with the International Coastal Cleanup, held on September 19 this year.

Quaids: 'We are requesting asylum from Hollywood star whackers' By the CNN Wire Staff Randy Quaid, right, and wife Evi, are seeking assylum in Canada, according to their lawyer. STORY HIGHLIGHTSTroubled actor Randy Quaid and his wife are contesting their extradition from CanadaThey are wanted in California on burglary chargesIt has been a year of legal woes for the couple (CNN) -- It sounds like a plot out of an upcoming Halloween horror movie, but for troubled actor Randy Quaid and his wife, Evi, their fear of "Hollywood star whackers" is real. The couple, facing burglary charges in Santa Barbara, California, stemming from a September incident, are seeking asylum in Canada, where they were arrested last week, Randy Quaid's attorney, Robert M. Sanger, told CNN on Sunday. "The Quaids are contesting their extradition in Vancouver and, if the matter is returned to Santa Barbara, we will address the issues in court," Sanger said. Outside their immigration hearing in a Vancouver court on Friday, their local attorney held up a handwritten note from the Quaids, which read: "Yes we are requesting asylum from Hollywood 'star whackers.'" As the Quaids were entering the hearing, they briefly addressed reporters about their fears. "Canada is a very protective nation," Randy Quaid said. "Hollywood is murdering its movie stars for ad sales. ... We want asylum from the murderous people in Hollywood. Accountants and lawyers -- embezzlers," Evi Quaid said, adding that "Heath Ledger was murdered." Ledger, a co-star of Randy Quaid's in 2005's "Brokeback Mountain," died in 2008 of an apparent drug overdose. When asked whether they had drug and alcohol problems, both Quaids responded, "No." A California judge issued a bench warrant October 18 for the couple's arrest after they failed to appear for a court hearing related to their September arrest. The Quaids were due in court on burglary charges after police were called to a Montecito, California, residence to investigate a report of squatters. A new court date has been scheduled for Tuesday.

A representative for the owner of the property came by the house to check the security alarm because it had gone off earlier that day and then discovered that someone was living in the property's guesthouse, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. The Quaids weren't around at the time, but upon their return later that evening the couple told police that they have "owned the property since the 1990s," a statement from the sheriff's department said. The owners had documentation that another buyer had purchased the property from the Quaids several years earlier, according to the statement. A contractor who worked on the residence told police he believes the couple caused more than $5,000 in damages in the guesthouse, and the Quaids were charged with residential burglary. Their September arrest comes amid a year of troubles for the couple. Earlier this year, the Quaids were both facing felony charges of defrauding an innkeeper and skipping out on a $10,000 hotel bill in Santa Barbara, California, in September 2009. The felony charges were dropped in April after Evi Quaid accepted a plea deal in the case. She was sentenced to three years of probation and 240 hours of community service. Randy Quaid, 60, is known for his roles in several films, including the "National Lampoon" movies, "Kingpin" and "Brokeback Mountain." He was nominated for an Academy Award for his supporting role in 1973's "The Last Detail." His younger brother is actor Dennis Quaid.

Islamist leader, who offered aid after Sandy, speaks to CNN
From Journalist Saima Mohsin
updated 10:25 AM EDT, Sat November 3, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The U.S. has a $10,000,000 bounty on Hafiz Mohammed Saeed's head
The State Department rejected Saeed's offer to help Sandy's victims
Saeed is suspected of direct responsibility for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166
Saeed softened his stance on the implementation of Sharia in an interview with CNN
(CNN) -- Wanted. $10 million reward.
Someone with that bounty on his head would normally have to be in hiding. Not Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, the leader of Pakistan's Jamaat-ud-Dawa (Party of Truth), considered a terrorist organization by the United States.
Saeed made headlines in the wake of Superstorm Sandy after he offered to send aid to its victims in the United States, which Washington quickly rejected.
"This particular offer strikes us as very hollow," State Department spokesman Mark Toner has said.
India and Washington accuse Saeed of being directly responsible for the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people, and the U.S. government offered the handsome bounty for information leading to his capture.
U.S. declines Pakistani radical's offer to help Sandy victims
Despite his high profile, he says he does not live in seclusion, and he runs 150 madrassas and schools across the country. The U.N. Security Council even published a street address for him in Lahore in 2008.
CNN sat down to record an interview with him in a building across from his home.
But Saeed takes security seriously and required that the crew first meet with one of his men on the outskirts of Lahore then follow him into town. Checkpoints lined the block around his house.
He agreed to the interview with a Western news organization, only because he wanted to talk about his offer to Sandy's victims.
"We have differences with the American government's policies, but the American people are only human; we are all human. It's not their fault," Saeed told CNN.
In a sermon, which can be found on the Internet, he has blasted the West as being the real terrorists.
Saeed has repeatedly denied any involvement with the Mumbai killings or support for terrorism despite accusations he has masterminded numerous attacks.
"I condemn this attack and the innocent lives that have been lost," he said. "I don't support this attack or any violence of this kind, but you don't even seem to believe me; I've said it so many times."
He highlighted charitable activities by Jamaat-ud-Dawa.
The U.S. State Department describes JuD's mission as the establishment of Islamist rule in India and Pakistan.
Saeed softened his stance on Sharia law when speaking to CNN, saying he did not want to impose the strict laws by force but encourage it by raising awareness instead. It was a departure from past radical positions.
To the U.N. Security Council, Saeed's party is synonymous with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and he is its leader, who also actively supports al Qaeda and the Taliban.
Even Lashkar-e-Tayyiba as denied responsibility for the Mumbai attacks, which saw the Taj Mahal Hotel set alight, according to the Council on Foreign Affairs.
The outlawed group, whose name translates to "army of the pure,"has a reputation for being particularly active in the conflict region of Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan place varying claims on it. China lays claim to a small part of it as well.
India's National Investigation Agency is to carry out inquiries in Pakistan into possible connections with the Mumbai attacks. Saeed told CNN he would speak with them.
He said he has written letters to the U.N. and the European Union in attempts to clear his name, even offering to cooperate with investigations -- to no avail.
Until then, Hafiz Saeed - surrounded by armed guards - says he will continue to provide moral support, but no more, in the cause of liberating Kashmir.
And he will deliver relief aid to the people of Pakistan, as the United States will not accept his offers.

Juventus leaves Celtic's Champions League dream in tatters
updated 6:39 PM EST, Tue February 12, 2013
Celtic had suffered just two home defeats in 23 Champions League games before welcoming Juventus to Parkhead. The Scottish champion saw off the might of Barcelona in the Group Stage with the famous Celtic atmosphere a huge factor in the team's success.
Alessandro Matri gave Juventus the perfect start by firing the Italian side ahead after just three minutes. Matri's effort was adjudged to have crossed the line before Claudio Marchisio smashed the ball into the back of the net.
Juventus stun Celtic Park thanks to Matri's early strike and temporarily silence one of the most partisan crowds in European football. The goal came following a dreadful defensive error from Efe Ambrose, who helped Nigerian win the Africa Cup of Nations just last Sunday.
Celtic captain Scott Brown rages at Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo during the high octane clash. Pirlo, who played a starring role in Italy's run to the World Cup Final last year, was outstanding once again at the heart of the Juventus midfield.
Celtic striker Gary Hooper had scored 22 goals in 34 appearances before taking on Juventus Tuesday, but the in-form forward couldn't find a way past a deteremined Italian defense.
Claudio Marchisio celebrates after firing Juventus into a 2-0 lead with 13 minutes remaining. After enduring a barrage of Celtic pressure, Marchisio rounded off an incisive move to inflict further damage upon the home side.
Mirko Vucinic rubbed salt into Celtic wounds by firing home his side's third and final goal in the 83rd minute following another defensive mistake by Efe Ambrose. The tie is all but over going into the second leg in Turin on March 6.
David Beckham was in attendance to watch his new club Paris Saint-Germain take on Valencia in the last-16 of the European Champions League. Beckham recently signed a five-month deal to play in the French capital and hopes to make his debut in the next couple of weeks.
Ezequiel Lavezzi celebrates his early strike for Paris Saint-Germain with teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Argentine struck in the 10th minute and has now scored in each of his past three Champions League games.
Javier Pastore doubled PSG's lead with just two minutes of the first half remaining after a flowing move scythed through the Valencia defense. The talented Argentine playmaker was just one of a number of stars on show for the French club along with Ibrahimovic, Lucas Moura and Lavezzi.
Ibrahimovic was shown a straight red card following a controversial studs-up challenge on Andres Guardado. It was the Swede's third red of his Champions League career, only Edgar Davids, four, has more. It means that the striker will miss the second leg in Paris.
Valencia's Adil Rami pulled a goal back in the final minute to give his side a lifeline going into the second leg in France. The La Liga side had won all eight of its Champions League home against French opposition before Tuesday's defeat.

(CNN) -- Juventus took a giant step towards the quarterfinals of the European Champions League following a crushing 3-0 win over Celtic.
Alesandro Matri's early strike and further goals from Claudio Marchisio and Mirko Vucinic completed a perfect night's work for the Italian champions.
There was also success for Paris Saint-Germain, which claimed a 2-1 away win at Valencia, although it must do without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the second leg after he was shown a straight red card.
Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore had given the French club a two goal lead at the break, but Adil Rami's late strike and Ibrahimovic's dismissal means its all to play for in the French capital in three weeks time.

Juventus midfielder: Stop racism
While PSG might still have to sweat, no such problems are expected for Serie A leaders and two-time European Cup winners Juventus.
Dressed in all black and surrounded by the cauldron of Celtic Park, Juventus headed out to face one of the most intimidating atmospheres in European football.
With the majority of the 57,917 crowd clad in green and white bellowing out their support for the Scottish champion, it was clear that this night was something special.
Back in the knockout phase for the first time in five years, Celtic was dreaming of the glory days when it ruled the continent following its legendary cup final win of 1967.
The victory over the might of Inter Milan in Lisbon, led to the team, which was to become known as the 'Lisbon Lions', becoming the first non-Latin side to win the trophy.
Managed by the legendary Jock Stein, all of the players were born within a 30 mile radius of Glasgow.
On May 24 1967, Lisbon was overrun with the green and white of Celtic and not that of local club Sporting.
Goals from Tommy Gemmel and Stevie Chalmers secured victory over an Inter side which had won three of the four past editions of the competition.
"There is not a prouder man on God's Earth than me at this moment," said Stein following the triumph.
"Winning was important, but it was the way that we won that has filled me with satisfaction.
"We did it by playing football; pure, beautiful, inventive football. There was not a negative thought in our heads."
The Real Madrid team poses for a photograph ahead of the second leg of the European Cup semifinal against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 1957 with captain Alfredo Di Stefano clutching his side's pennant.
Manchester United, who were the 1956 and 1957 league champions, became the first English side to take part in the European Cup, reaching the semifinals before being beaten by Real Madrid. Tragically, six of the United players who faced Madrid were killed in Munich the following year.
Duncan Edwards, one of the greatest players of his generation, lost his life in the Munich Air Disaster in 1958 at the age of 21. He was the youngest player to represent England after the war and won two league titles with the club before his life was so tragically cut short.
Roger Byrne captained Manchester United under manager Matt Busby but he too lost his life in the Munich Air Disaster of 1958. An inspirational and charismatic figure, he was Busby's leader on the pitch until his death. Just days after he passed away, his widow Joy discovered she was pregnant.
After survivng the Munich Air Crash at the age of 20, Bobby Charlton went on to become both a local and national hero for club and country. He scored 249 goals in 758 appearances for Manchester United during a 17-year playing career. He won three league titles, the 1963 FA Cup and 1968 European Cup. He was also a key member of the England side which won the World Cup on home soil in 1966 and he remains the country's top scorer to this very day with 49 international goals.
David Pegg had caused Real all sorts of problems in the first leg of the semifinal leading the Spaniards to fetch in Valencia's tough-tackling defender Manuel Torres on-loan for one game only. Pegg made his debut at the age of 17 after joining straight from school and had been tipped to shine on the international stage until his untimely death in Munich at the age of 22.
This giant mural outside Old Trafford next to the statue of Busby depicts the United team lining up at their European Cup game with Red Star Belgrade before the disaster at Munich airport on February 6, 1958. Their legacy will never be forgotten. Real Madrid dominated European football during the 1950s by winning the competition five times in succession between 1955 and 1960. Hungarian star Ferenc Puskas joined the club in 1958 to link up with Di Stefano, Kopa, Gento and Rial to form one of the most exciting teams ever seen.

When Real rained on United's parade
Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo warmed up for the Champions League clash with his former club Manchester United by scoring a hat-trick in the 4-1 victory at home to Sevilla. English Premier League leaders United are in pole position to reclaim the title from Manchester City, whose manager Roberto Mancini was furious with his players after a 3-1 defeat at Southampton. City's low point came when Gareth Barry -- who had been at fault for the first goal -- passed the ball into his own net to restore Southampton's advantage after Edin Dzeko had reduced the deficit just before the break. Alessandro Matri helped Juventus move five points clear in Italy's Serie A, scoring the second goal in the 2-0 win at home to Fiorentina despite losing his boot before firing into the net. David Alaba helped Bayern Munich move 15 points clear in Germany's Bundesliga, with the 20-year-old Austrian scoring twice in the 4-0 win at home to Schalke.

Ronaldo fires United warning
Hayatou: Good example key against racism
That night in Lisbon is never far from memory whenever the words 'Europe' and 'Celtic' are mentioned in the same breath. They are synonomous.
The success of the past generation is a reminder of how Celtic became the first British club to win the competition, a fact which supporters are quick to point out at every opportunity.
But while it has dominated domestically in recent years, helped by the downfall of fierce rival Glasgow Rangers, success in Europe has been more difficult to achieve.
Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United: Which is the biggest club? Not since it lost to Porto in the 2003 UEFA Cup final had Celtic hit the European headlines, that was until this year and its shock victory over Barcelona.
A 2-1 home win against the La Liga champions helped Neil Lennon's side qualify for the last-16 and a meeting with Juventus.
While the visitor appeared favorite on paper, Celtic's home form in the Champions League has been nothing short of remarkable.
In its 23 matches before welcoming Juventus, Celtic had suffered just two defeats, while winning 15 and drawing six.
With the second leg in Turin on March 6 to come, the home side would have hoped to secure a result in a bid to keep the tie alive.
The atmosphere suggested a gladiatorial arena, the bloodcurdling noise of Celtic Park rose as the players emerged. This was Celtic's time.
Foreign owners in UK football: The good the bad and the ugly
Or perhaps not. Instead, it took Juventus just three minutes to silence one of European football's most intimidating arenas.
On Sunday, Efe Ambrose was celebrating Nigeria's victory in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations -- but on a freezing February night in Glasgow he was left to rue a horrendous defensive error.
It was his mistake which allowed Federico Peluso's long ball to release Alessandro Matri and the striker fired home, despite Kelvin Wilson trying to clear off the line.
The shock and horror was etched across the faces of the Celtic players, but slowly and surely, those emblazoned with the green and white began to show its famous spirit.
Kris Commons came agonizingly close to an equalizer when his overhead kick sailed just inches wide of the far post, while Ambrose should have netted with a free header just after the hour mark.
That miss was to be severely punished as Juventus wrapped the game up with 13 minutes remaining when Matri released Marchisio, who turned Scott Brown and slotted the ball home.
Worse was to come for Celtic with 83 minutes on the clock when Ambrose, who only returned from South Africa on Tuesday morning, gave away possession and Vucinic raced in to score.
Robin van Persie celebrates after scoring Manchester United's second goal in the 2-0 win at home to Everton, which put his team 12 points clear in the English Premier League.
Van Persie rounded Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard to score his 19th EPL goal this season, sealing a crucial victory ahead of the midweek Champions League trip to Real Madrid.
Veteran Ryan Giggs scored a 13th-minute opener, meaning the 39-year-old has now been on target for each of last 23 league seasons.
Before the match, United fans held aloft a banner honoring the victims of the 1958 Munich Air Disaster,which killed eight of the club's players among 23 dead.

Man Utd move 12 points clear
Mario Balotelli was mobbed by fans outside a restaurant as he returned home to Italy to complete his $30 million move from AC Milan to Manchester City.
His future at the English Premier League champions had been in doubt since his training ground bust-up with manager Roberto Mancini in early January, when coaching staff had to intervene to separate the pair. Mancini later downplayed the tussle, sparked by Balotelli's hostile tackle on a fellow player, as "nothing unusual."
Balotelli made his Inter Milan debut in 2007 after being signed by the club at the age of 15. He scored the first goals of his senior career in a Coppa Italia match against Reggina in December of that year.
Balotelli joined Manchester City from Italian club Inter Milan. His relationship with Inter coach Jose Mourinho endured numerous ups and downs. Disciplinary issues littered his time at the San Siro and the situation came to a head in March 2010, when Balotelli was left out of Inter's squad for a Champions League tie after an altercation with Mourinho. Mancini was Balotelli's first coach at Inter Milan and the pair were reunited in 2010 when the striker joined Manchester City. The start of Balotelli's City career was disrupted by injury, but he finally scored his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 away win at West Bromwich Albion. His joy at netting a brace was short-lived, however, as he was sent off after picking up two yellow cards.
Balotelli became a hit with City's fans, as much for off-field antics as his goalscoring. His stock with the supporters was never higher than in October 2011, when he scored twice in City's 6-1 thumping of neighbors Manchester United at Old Trafford. After scoring the first goal in City's victory, he revealed a t-shirt stating "Why always me?" -- instantly creating one of the most iconic images of the Premier League era. City went to beat United to the English title on goal difference with a dramatic last-gasp victory over Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the season.
Balotelli reminded everyone of his undoubted talent during the 2012 European Championships. He scored three times as Italy reached the final, including both goals in the Azzurri's 2-1 semi win over Germany. Italy lost 4-0 to Spain in the final of the tournament co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.

Being Balotelli: The life and times of Mario
Match-fixing scandal engulfs Europe
"We need a miracle," Celtic manager Lennon told ITV. "But it's the harsh reality of Champions League football and some of my young players will learn a huge lesson tonight.
"I thought for 70-odd minutes, until the second goal, we were by far the better side -- but you can't give away goals like we gave away, sloppy."
How Manchester United tried to drown the stars of Real Madrid in 1957
On a day when wrestling was dropped from the Olympics, Lennon was frustrated with the way Juventus' defenders manhandled his players at set-pieces.
Time and time again, defender Stephane Lichtsteiner was grappling with Gary Hooper and Scott Brown inside the penalty area, but nothing was forthcoming from referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco.
"I'd like to ask the referee, is the game different in Spain or Italy?" Lennon said.
"Every time one of my players tried to move he was held. He should have given a penalty on at least two occasions."
Big spending masks age of austerity for top soccer clubs
While that win all but secures Juventus' place in the last eight, PSG faces a more difficult proposition following an infuriatingly frustrating second half performance.
In front of a watching David Beckham, who is hoping to make his debut within the next few weeks, PSG showed why they should be feared in this year's competition.
Leading 2-0 thanks to goals from Lavezzi and Pastore, Carlo Ancelotti's men missed several golden opportunities and could have easily scored four or five at the Mestalla.
Lavezzi, who has now scored in each of his past three Champions League games, should have had a hat-trick only to miss two simple chances.
Beckham to donate PSG wages to children's charity
That wastefulness was punished in the final minute when Rami bundled home from close range to give the home side hope.
The tie then took another twist when Ibrahimovic was shown a straight red card for a controversial studs up challenge on Andres Guardado.
"Ibrahimovic did not deserve the red card. I don't understand the decision," Ancelotti told French Canal Plus television at full time.
"We played well and had chances to score more goals. It was a good team performance, but this was just the first leg. There is still the return to come."

Natural gas rig burns in Gulf of Mexico
By Joe Sutton and Dave Alsup, CNN
updated 2:16 AM EDT, Thu July 25, 2013
The Hercules 265 drilling rig sits in about 150 feet of water, officials say.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Firefighting boats are moved out of the fire's range, BSEE says
The blast occurs on a platform roughly 60 miles off Grand Isle, Louisiana
Crew members hit an unexpected pocket of gas
A Coast Guard vessel witnesses the blast late Tuesday
(CNN) -- Two firefighting boats were moved to a safe distance Wednesday as they awaited help in fighting a fire that erupted on a natural gas rig in the Gulf of Mexico, officials say.
"A third vessel equipped with firefighting capability and (an) improved monitoring system" was expected to arrive around midday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said.
A Coast Guard cutter was on hand to "assess the situation and enforce the security zone," it said, while another was on the way.
Forty-four workers were evacuated from the rig earlier Tuesday after a blowout occurred, officials said. Crew members aboard the Hercules 265, leased by Houston-based Walter Oil & Gas Corp., were preparing the well for production when they hit an unexpected pocket of gas.
No injuries were reported.
Natural gas was leaking at the site, but no oil was being released, the BSEE said after it and the Coast Guard sent flights over the rig Wednesday morning.
"There is no observed sheen on the water surface," the safety bureau said in a news release.
"As the rig fire continues, the beams supporting the derrick and rig floor have folded and have collapsed over the rig structure," which is in about 150 feet of water, it said. "Under BSEE's direction, Walter Oil & Gas has begun preparations to move a jack-up rig on location to potentially drill a relief well."
The platform, about 60 miles southwest of Grand Isle, Louisiana, exploded around 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, the Coast Guard reported. It said a Coast Guard vessel witnessed the blast.
A light sheen about a half-mile wide was initially spotted by environmental inspectors but dissipated "almost immediately," the BSEE said.

'Poop cruise' witness: 'I got mentally injured'
By Scott Bronstein, CNN
updated 10:26 AM EST, Tue February 25, 2014
A federal judge has ruled Carnival liable and responsible for the engine fire that left the ill-fated Triumph cruise adrift in the Gulf of Mexico in February 2013. More than 4,200 passengers endured power outages, overflowing toilets and food shortages. Click through the gallery to see some other unfortunate events that have affected recent cruises.
Princess Cruises' Caribbean Princess, seen here, cut its seven-day trip short after at least 165 passengers and 11 crew members reported being ill, the cruise company said January 31.
Nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill aboard Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, which returned home to New Jersey on January 29. It is the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In 2013, the Silver Shadow, run by Silversea Cruises, failed a CDC health inspection over concerns about hiding food in crew cabins. On Memorial Day last year, a fire aboard Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas cut short a seven-day cruise to Port Canaveral, Florida, and the Bahamas. The ship changed its course and sailed under its own power to Freeport in the Bahamas.
Carnival Legend, shown here in 2012, had to cancel a scheduled March stop on Grand Cayman after propulsion system problems hampered its sailing speed. It arrived in Tampa, Florida, hours ahead of schedule.
The Carnival Dream, shown here at its North American debut in November 2009, lost power in March, and some of its toilets stopped working temporarily. For a time, no one was allowed to get off the vessel, docked at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean.
During a surprise visit in August 2012, CDC inspectors found multiple sanitation violations on the Holland America ship ms Veendam (shown here in March 2012). The CDC found enough violations, including brown liquid dripping on clean dishes and a fly on the buffet, to give the Veendam a failing grade.
A fire in the Carnival Splendor engine room in November 2010 crippled the cruise ship, stranding passengers off the coast of Mexico for several days without air conditioning or hot showers.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Passengers suing Carnival recount ill-fated Triumph cruise
A federal judge has already ruled Carnival liable and responsible for fire
Yet the cruise line is not responsible for providing a safe voyage
Lawyers are already arguing over how much compensation is due
Miami (CNN) -- One year after the Carnival Triumph cruise ship caught fire and lost power in the Gulf of Mexico, stranding frightened passengers in filth and misery for days, thinking about the ill-fated voyage can make Kimberly Northom Townsend break down and cry.
That's what happened in the middle of her testimony before a U.S. federal judge in Miami last week, during the first civil trial about the February 2013 voyage.
Townsend, a 54-year-old mother of two and grandmother of three, was one of 31 passengers who are plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Carnival, alleging the company's responsibility for the ill-fated voyage.
She had just finished testifying in graphic detail what it was like on the ship as it sat disabled for days in the Gulf. Terrified passengers huddled on decks worried about their safety, she said, with foul toilets overflowing into hallways, no power, near-total darkness, long lines for rationed water and almost no food.
Carnival CEO: 'We failed'
First passengers exit Triumph
Passengers file suit against Carnival
Townsend described how she finally reached her mother on the phone when the broken ship got towed into Mobile, Alabama, days late from what was supposed to have been the vacation of a lifetime. She told the court she begged her mother to come get her immediately. And as she spoke, her voice trailed away, she looked down, and began sobbing in the witness chair.
Townsend was one of numerous Carnival Triumph passengers who testified, sometimes crying, about the conditions on the boat and how they still suffer one year later.
Who got injured and how much is it worth?
The trial is expected to continue for several weeks, with lawyers for passengers suing Carnival Corp. and lawyers for the cruise line arguing over whether, and to what degree, passengers got injured, if they remain hurt and how much Carnival should pay for those damages.
Fuel leak sparked cruise ship fire
But while testimony has finished only its first week, the legal case has already brought some unusual and significant rulings from the judge, U.S. District Judge Donald Graham.
Before testimony began, Graham ruled Carnival is liable and responsible for the fire on board the Triumph because of negligence on the part of the company. The judge agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued a presumption of liability based upon an older common law idea of negligence. Going back to the Romans, the Latin doctrine of "res ipsa loquitur" means roughly "the thing speaks for itself."
The judge's ruling is sweeping and unusual in a major cruise ship disaster, with larger possible implications for future cruises and passengers.
"The Court finds that the record evidence demonstrates that the fire and resulting conditions experienced by Plaintiffs aboard the Triumph is a mishap that ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence," wrote Graham. "It is highly likely that Carnival was responsible for a reasonably probable causes to which the accident could have be (sic) attributed. Here, the facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence."
Passengers not promised a safe voyage
But Graham also ruled that the company did not breach its contract with passengers, agreeing with Carnival's argument that when passengers bought a ticket, they were never promised a safe voyage at all, which may come as a big surprise to future cruise passengers.
"The contract ticket makes no express guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions," wrote Graham. The ruling reflects the little protections afforded to passengers as currently written by many cruise ship companies.
Graham also ruled that Carnival does not have to pay punitive damages to plaintiffs who say they were hurt and are seeking financial compensation.
Your rights on a cruise ship
"Carnival contends that there is no evidence of intentional wrongdoing," Graham wrote. "Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate and the record evidence does not support a finding of intentional misconduct."
Next on the agenda: Graham must determine which passengers were injured, how much Carnival must pay for those injuries and how long the company must pay. Testimony from passengers is expected to continue for at least another week.
Many passengers have already testified to injuries they sustained during the cruise, though few are physical in nature.
'I got mentally injured'
"I did not get physically injured. I got mentally injured," testified Jean Cripps, a 74-year-old grandmother who suffers from Parkinson's disease. She went on the cruise with her husband, Alton, who has diabetes and a hurt leg that forced him to retire disabled. The elderly couple was on the cruise as a present from their son, David, and grandson, Easton, who went with them.
"It never ends, the whole experience never ends," testified Cripps. "It's over and over again. We had two good days," she said, referring to the first days of the cruise.
"But that's not what I think about. I think about the smell, the stench and the bad things. All the memories come flooding back, and I can't stop them."
Are cruise ships floating petri dishes?
Among the worst memories, Cripps testified, was the fear that the ship, which listed severely after the fire, would actually turn over and sink.
Alton had to go several days without his diabetes medicine and was forced to climb numerous flights of often slippery stairs with his bad leg, causing him to fall once.
"It was a horrible experience," testified Michelle Key, 48, who went on the cruise with her mother, Fleda Key, 68. "I walked through water and feces and urine, no telling what else," she testified. "We would slip and slide through greasy, gross, slippery muck," she said, adding "it was very difficult" for her mother.
Fleda Key described having terrible diarrhea on numerous occasions and having difficulty finding any toilets that were not overflowing.
Fear of dying before reaching shore
"There was lots of urine and feces all the way up to the rim of every one," she said, explaining she "choked away the smell." Like many of the witnesses, she testified that she lived for days in total fear that they might not finish the voyage alive. "I was fearful, downright afraid and scared," said Fleda Key.
Her daughter, like many of those testifying, said the cruise ship company kept them in the dark, with no information about what was truly happening, and did not care for them properly.
"Carnival Cruise did not give one flip about the ... passengers on that ship," Michelle Key testified. "They did not do their best."
When asked by Graham what Carnival should have done, she responded, "If they knew something was wrong, they should never have left the dock."
Michelle Key may have been referring to the company's internal documents that became public through this lawsuit in December and obtained exclusively by CNN.
CNN Exclusive: Documents show Carnival knew of fire danger before ill-fated cruise
The documents revealed the fiasco on board the Carnival Triumph was a problem waiting to happen. Internal company documents show that the crew of the Triumph set sail in February with only four of six generators fully operational, knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard in ships across its fleet, including the Triumph.
A Triumph generator was overdue for maintenance
The first trouble with Triumph was in diesel generator No. 6 -- the one that wound up catching fire. Starting more than a year before the cruise, that generator was overdue for maintenance and often not in compliance with the safety laws of the sea, known as SOLAS, according to the ship's engineer.
Read the document about the generator (PDF)
Over and over again, Carnival's own maintenance reports stated the same thing: Diesel generator No. 6 was overdue for maintenance. The company says the fire that originated with the generator was not connected to the lack of maintenance. But, during that same period, Carnival learned about another, even more alarming safety problem in the engine room: fuel lines.
A dangerous pattern of leaks had emerged on other Carnival cruise ships, according to the company's documents. In fact, Carnival's Costa Allegra caught fire in the Indian Ocean in February 2012 because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited. That fire left the ship without power for three days in tropical heat of nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
Read Carnival's advisory notice (PDF)
That would be eerily similar to what started the fire on board the Triumph one year later.
Carnival says it proactively began investigating after the Costa Allegra fire and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line. There had been nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years.
Spate of fires pose problem for cruise industry
On January 2, Carnival issued a compliance order, giving ships two months to address the problem to "ensure a suitable spray shield ... is installed" for all diesel engines using the flexible fuel lines. "After that internal study, the company came out with a new policy to, again, shield all the flanges and the hoses," said Mark Jackson, Carnival Cruise Lines vice president of technical operations.
What went wrong on the 'poop' cruise?
But Carnival did not in fact shield the part of the one hose that wound up causing the fire on board the Triumph in February.
"That hose was beneath the deck plates, and it was believed the deck plates would provide that shield," Jackson said. "In this case, it (the fuel leak) found that gap in the hose ... in the bilge plates and caused the fire."
On February 7 -- with a diesel generator still in need of overhaul and fuel line shields on some, but not all, of its flexible hoses -- Triumph set sail from Galveston, Texas. Three days later, off the coast of Mexico, a fire broke out in diesel generator No. 6 when fuel sprayed from a flexible fuel line, even though that fuel line was only 6 months old.
Speaking about the ship, Jackson said: "We were totally in compliance ... with all the rules and regulations. ... We had ... our regulating bodies on board the ship less than two weeks prior that had certified the ship to sail. Obviously, you learn things in a situation, in an incident such as the Triumph."
While Carnival Cruise Lines insists that what happened on the Triumph was just an accident, the company has dedicated $300 million in a fleetwide safety upgrade, focusing on detecting and preventing any potential fire hazards in its engine rooms.
Attorneys for both sides declined to speak about the case during the trial but their opening statements provide some clues about their respective strategies.
Asking for compensation of $1 million
In his opening statement, plaintiffs' attorney Frank Spagnoletti of Houston told the court, "There's documented evidence with regard to any number of plaintiffs that show that they were physically injured, and there is ample documented evidence that shows that all of the plaintiffs were injured mentally because of the way they were exposed to this."
When pressed for details on compensation, Spagnoletti told the court that passengers should receive anywhere from $30,000 to $1 million, depending on the severity of their injuries.
"What happened on the Triumph "is certainly not something that Carnival would ever want to have happen and would ever want its guests to experience," said Miami attorney Curtis Mase, representing Carnival. But he also told Judge Graham that many of the plaintiffs alleging various injuries have never sought medical treatment for their injuries and do not deserve compensation.
"I think that there's no one who I would suggest to you is entitled to receive more than $50,000, and I'm going to suggest probably lower numbers after we've heard all the evidence," Mase told the court.
"There are a number who I believe deserve nothing. And I will tell you this, the one or two that I can think of who have significant injuries, they're very much in the minority and there are only one or two."
