A 'Simpsons' milestone (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair lends his voice to "The Simpsons" in a new episode airing this week.
Fox has been running promotional ads for the episode, in which Homer takes Marge and the kids on a trip to London, at one point ramming a car through the gates of Buckingham Palace and upending the queen's horse-drawn carriage.
Over the years, hundreds of celebrities have visited Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie Simpson in their hometown of Springfield.
"The Simpsons," now in its 15th season, holds the title for "Most Celebrities Featured in an Animation series" in the Guinness Book of World Records. By the time its contract is concluded -- in spring 2005 -- the show will also claim the record for the longest-running sitcom ever, besting "The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet."
With his appearance this week, Blair joins such celebrity guest stars as Magic Johnson, David Hyde Pierce, Kelsey Grammer, Paul and his late first wife Linda McCartney, Meryl Streep, Aerosmith, Jack Lemmon, Mel Gibson and Britney Spears.
A spokesman in Blair's press office told CNN the prime minister taped the voiceover in April, at the height of the Iraq war.
He said Blair is a big fan of "The Simpsons" and likes to watch the show with his three teenage children.
In the episode, Blair meets the Simpsons at London's Heathrow Airport and invites them for tea at his official residence, No. 10 Downing Street.
After getting advice from Blair on where to visit in London, Homer causes chaos by tipping tea from his Union Jack cup over the carpet. He ends up locked in the Tower of London.
The episode is entitled "The Regina Monologues" -- a play on the Latin for queen and the theater production "The Vagina Monologues."
The show, which also features the voice of "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling, aired Sunday in the United States and will air in Britain in January.

Half of primary-care doctors in survey would leave medicineStory Highlights Doctors cite red tape from insurance companies, government agencies Med school students shy away from family medicine Shortage of primary care physicians predicted to be 35,000 to 40,000 by 2025 Next Article in Health » Read VIDEO By Val Willingham CNN Medical Producer	(CNN) -- Nearly half the respondents in a survey of U.S. primary care physicians said that they would seriously consider getting out of the medical business within the next three years if they had an alternative. Experts say if many physicians stop practicing, it could be devastating to the health care industry. The survey, released this week by the Physicians' Foundation, which promotes better doctor-patient relationships, sought to find the reasons for an identified exodus among family doctors and internists, widely known as the backbone of the health industry. A U.S. shortage of 35,000 to 40,000 primary care physicians by 2025 was predicted at last week's American Medical Association annual meeting. In the survey, the foundation sent questionnaires to more than 270,000 primary care doctors and more than 50,000 specialists nationwide. Of the 12,000 respondents, 49 percent said they'd consider leaving medicine. Many said they are overwhelmed with their practices, not because they have too many patients, but because there's too much red tape generated from insurance companies and government agencies. And if that many physicians stopped practicing, that could be devastating to the health care industry. Dr. Gupta: Watch more on the looming doctor dearth » "We couldn't survive that," says Dr. Walker Ray, vice president of the Physicians Foundation. "We are only producing in this country a thousand to two thousand primary doctors to replace them. Medical students are not choosing primary care." Dr. Alan Pocinki has been practicing medicine for 17 years. He began his career around the same time insurance companies were turning to the PPO and HMO models. So he was a little shocked when he began spending more time on paperwork than patients and found he was running a small business, instead of a practice. He says it's frustrating. Don't Miss Waiting for the doctor ... and waiting, and waiting
"I had no business training, as far as how to run a business, or how to evaluate different plans," Pocinki says. "It was a whole brave new world and I had to sort of learn on the fly." To manage their daily work schedules, many survey respondents reported making changes. With lower reimbursement from insurance companies and the cost of malpractice insurance skyrocketing, these health professionals say it's not worth running a practice and are changing careers. Others say they're going into so-called boutique medicine, in which they charge patients a yearly fee up front and don't take insurance. And some like Pocinki are limiting the type of insurance they'll take and the number of patients on Medicare and Medicaid. According to the foundation's report, over a third of those surveyed have closed their practices to Medicaid patients and 12 percent have closed their practices to Medicare patients That can leave a lot of patients looking for a doctor. And as Ray mentioned, med school students are shying away from family medicine. In a survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in September, only 2 percent of current medical students plan to take up primary care. That's because these students are wary of the same complaints that are causing existing doctors to flee primary care: hectic clinics, burdensome paperwork and systems that do a poor job of managing patients with chronic illness. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Health Library
So what to do? Physicians don't have a lot of answers. But doctors say it's time to make some changes, not only in the health care field but also with the insurance industry. And they're looking to the new administration for guidance. One of President-elect Barack Obama's health care promises is to provide a primary care physician for every American. But some health experts, including Pocinki, are skeptical. "People who have insurance can't find a doctor, so suddenly we are going to give insurance to a whole bunch of people who haven't had it, without increasing the number of physicians?" he says. "It's going to be a problem."

Lung cancer vaccine 'extends terminal patients lives'Story Highlights Patients live longer, says Cuban inventor of first registered lung cancer vaccine Cuba approved the use of CimaVax EGF for the general public last year Dr. Gonzales, who led the Cuban team says seven trials have been conducted 700 patients have received the vaccine over the years Next Article in Health » By Shasta Darlington CNN HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Terminal lung cancer patients are living longer thanks to the world's first registered lung cancer vaccine, a leading Cuban scientist says. Cuban scientist Dr. Gisela Gonzalez says she and her team have created a lung cancer vaccine that extends patient's lives. Dr. Gisela Gonzalez has spent years researching the vaccine which the Cuban government approved for the use of the general public last year. Gonzalez and her team have worked on developing the CimaVax EGF vaccine at the Cuban Center of Molecular Immunology since the early 1990s. She says all those years of hard work have finally paid off as trials show that Cubans with lung cancer are living a little longer after having the vaccine. "One of my early patients was a 32-year-old man when he started taking the vaccine. I had a son that age," the scientist told CNN. "Now he's 35. He's living and working. He visited us the other day and said he's thinking about having kids." Gonzalez says that more than 700 patients have received the vaccine over the years, many of them in seven clinical trials in Cuba, Canada and the UK. More than 400 advanced lung cancer patients received the Vaccine CimaVax EGF in the trials, according to the Latin American News Agency. Vital Signs

The trials showed that the drug extended the life of terminal patients by an average of four months, and in some cases several years, compared with those patients who only received traditional therapies. Younger patients tended to fare better. "It has the potential to be very important," according to Dr. Howard Burris, director of drug development at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee. He said the results were comparable to those being produced by two other lung cancer vaccines, GVAX and BLP 25, being developed in the United States. "Larger trials will show there are subsets that it's very good for and for others it's not relevant," he said. CimaVax EGF does not prevent or cure lung cancer. It is a therapeutic vaccine which stimulates the patient's body to make an antibody against the epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is a key driver causing lung cancer cells to grow. It is used in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation therapy which reduce the size of the initial tumor. Don't Miss

"With this kind of product, maybe cancer, advanced cancer, can be treated like any other chronic disease like diabetes," Dr. Gonzalez said during a recent tour of her modern laboratory in Havana. Medical services, even the most costly, are provided free of charge in communist Cuba. CimaVax EGF is now part of routine treatment for advanced lung cancer patients. Experts say that success is due in large part to a focus on preventative medicine and a very local approach to health that includes thousands of neighborhood physicians. Cuba has also developed a formidable biotechnology industry championed by Fidel Castro as early as the 1980s. Doctors here developed vaccines for Meningitis B and Hepatitis B which are now being used in a number of countries. Medical tourism is also on the rise, attracting paying patients from abroad. Dr. Gonzalez said CimaVax EGF has sparked a lot of interest internationally. She has advised foreign patients interested in the vaccine to seek approval from their national regulatory agencies to use it in their home country. She said two patients, one from Australia and one from Argentina, have already succeeded in doing so. In December, a lung cancer patient from Australia Liz Simon, wrote on a lung cancer forum Lungevity "Well it's actually arrived. After negotiations over six months, the CimaVax vaccine has actually arrived in Brisbane." Simon wrote that she was undergoing radiation treatment and would have to wait four weeks after that before starting the vaccine. "The vaccine's bona fides will be checked out before I start. And I will be using it under scientific conditions so that we can judge its efficacy. So let's see - I am happy to...become the resident guinea pig," she added. The Cuban team is now starting a clinical trial in Malaysia and hopes to begin others in China, India and Peru. Dr. Burris said an article last year by the Cuban doctors in the Journal of Clinical Oncology made a big splash in the scientific community, injecting new enthusiasm into U.S. research on the topic. "It's hard to get an antibody response once you've had chemotherapy," he said. "So if you have a vaccine and it works even half the time, that's pretty fabulous."

Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two of the seven CIA officers killed Wednesday in a suspected terrorist attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan were contractors for Xe, a private security firm formerly known as Blackwater, a former intelligence official said Thursday. A current intelligence official confirmed to CNN that the casualties included a mix of people -- CIA staff and contractors. The CIA considers contractors to be officers. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which wounded six other people. A senior U.S. official said information suggested that a bomber walked into a gym facility at Forward Operating Base Chapman -- in Khost Province, near the border of Pakistan -- and detonated bombs in a suicide vest. It is not known how the bomber got past security. In a posting on its Web site Thursday, the Taliban claimed the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier. A U.S. intelligence official on Thursday vowed that the United States would avenge the attack. "This attack will be avenged through successful, aggressive counterterrorism operations," the intelligence official vowed. Former CIA official Robert Richer called it "the greatest loss of life for the Central Intelligence Agency since the Beirut Embassy bombing" in 1983, which killed eight agents. Flags at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, flew at half-staff Thursday. "These brave Americans were part of a long line of patriots who have made great sacrifices for their fellow citizens, and for our way of life," President Obama said in a written statement Thursday. "The United States would not be able to maintain the freedom and security that we cherish without decades of service from the dedicated men and women of the CIA." Richer, who retired from the agency in 2005 as the associate deputy director for operations, knew many of Wednesday's victims personally. In a written statement Thursday, he called on the public to "remain mindful that our great country is served well by those in and out of uniform. That officers like those lost in this attack placed themselves in harm's way, at a critical and dangerous crossroads in the war on terror. "We should be thankful for the service and sacrifice of these fine Americans. They and their colleagues, who compose the very thin line of Agency officers working in the shadows at the very tip of the war on terror, are a national asset; an asset often misunderstood and under appreciated." CIA Director Leon Panetta said in a statement Thursday that "those who fell ... were far from home and close to the enemy, doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism." A U.S. military source noted that Chapman was originally a base for the Khost Provincial Construction Team, but the team left some time ago. A U.S. intelligence official would not discuss the specific mission of the base but acknowledged that it was a crucial CIA post and a "hub of activity." Authorities believe that the suicide bomber might have attacked just after a convoy was ending or beginning, which would account for the high number of casualties. Eight Americans were originally believed to be killed in the bombing. CNN's Barbara Starr, Pam Benson, Atia Abawi and Suzanne Simons and journalist Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.

Osama bin Laden's escape: A tale of subterfuge and hard cash By Tim Lister, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSOsama bin Laden escaped a dragnet around Tora Bora in Afghanistan in December 2001Many analysts have suggested that bin Laden slipped through mountain passes into PakistanGuantanamo Bay detainee says he went toward Jalalabad, then to Kunar, AfghanistanIt is said he escaped thanks to aid of a Pakistani cleric and tribes around Jalalabad (CNN) -- How did Osama bin Laden escape the dragnet that closed in around his mountain hideout in Afghanistan in December 2001? It's long been a topic of discussion in intelligence circles and among those (myself included) who witnessed the intense U.S. aerial bombardment of Tora Bora that went on for nearly two weeks. Many analysts have suggested that bin Laden slipped through mountain passes into Pakistan, just a few miles away. But assessments of Guantanamo Bay detainees suggest he went in another direction, evading the mujahideen of the Northern Alliance, as well as the small detachments of U.S. special forces who we first saw in the area around December 8th. The detainee assessments were made public by Wikileaks this week and published by the Washington Post, the Guardian and other media outlets. One of them, compiled in 2007, is about a detainee called Harun Shirzad al-Afghani. Al-Afghani was a commander in the militant group Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, a close ally at the time of al Qaeda. Al-Afghani claims that the al Qaeda leader escaped the area thanks to a Pakistani militant and cleric called Maulawi Nur Muhammad. And he says bin Laden headed north toward Jalalabad and later to the remote province of Kunar in north-east Afghanistan. WikiLeaks: Bin Laden strapped for cash
Documents describe bin Laden's moves

Osama bin Laden
In a few brief paragraphs at the end of his profile, al-Afghani is quoted as saying that he was directed by Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to "link up with al Qaeda forces in Tora Bora and exfiltrate OBL from the region." That group "lost radio contact with the Arabs in Tora Bora." (Hekmatyar, incidentally, is still a serious player in the region, loosely allied to the Taliban and regarded by many analysts as a critical part of any peace deal in Afghanistan.) And so Plan B came into play. Al-Afghani says Maulawi Nur Muhammad provided about 40 to 50 fighters to escort bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri away from Tora Bora. His help followed a meeting with an al Qaeda commander called Abu Turab al-Urdani, who also happened to be Zawahiri's son-in-law. According to the detainee assessment of al-Afghani, "Maulawi Nur Muhammad informed him of their escape approximately ten months after Tora Bora. Detainee's associate, Haji Abdul Abad, who directed a suicide operation targeting U.S. personnel in Jalalabad between August and September 2005, verified the details of UBL's escape." (UBL is the short-hand used for the al Qaeda leader throughout the detainee documents.) Other Guantanamo assessments seen by CNN suggest that bin Laden abruptly left Tora Bora on December 11. "UBL suddenly departed Tora Bora with a few individuals UBL selected," reads one report. His bodyguards left a day or two later and climbed the passes through the White Mountains into Pakistan, where they were detained by Pakistani paramilitary forces on December 15. Other detainees talk about an exodus of fighters around December 16 after negotiations with local Afghan commanders failed. The CNN team close to Tora Bora at the time was aware of and reported on radio contacts between the two sides, and it was evident that the poorly-equipped local militia sent to flush out al Qaeda militants had little appetite for the job. Hence the escape of senior figures in al Qaeda through the many ravines and valleys of the area. Perhaps bin Laden suspected the frontier with Pakistan would be too dangerous to cross. In any event, al Afghani says he traveled to a safe-house near the city of Jalalabad to rest -- before traveling on horseback towards Kunar. Kunar is rugged, violent and to many observers ungovernable -- a province where even today the Taliban and al Qaeda have a substantial presence and where coalition forces face persistent attacks. Al-Afghani says bin Laden remained in Kunar until late in 2002 before crossing the border into Pakistan. While al-Afghani's account is impossible to confirm, he had serious credentials as a courier and facilitator for al Qaeda until his capture in February 2007 close to Jalalabad. The document says the "detainee has provided unique information on al Qaeda's organizational structure and operations." And it fits with what CNN has learned from other sources. One man well connected with the al Qaeda leadership at the time was Noman Benotman, then a senior figure in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which had ties to al Qaeda. He was in phone contact with another Libyan close to bin Laden -- Abu Leith al Libbi -- after 9/11. Benotman told CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank that when al Libbi asked for reinforcements for the battle around Kabul, bin Laden's response was: "Whoever fights the Americans must follow us to Tora Bora." (Benotman is now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation, a UK counter-terrorism think tank.) He told CNN that when considering his exit bin Laden knew not to trust local people across the border in Pakistan -- a lawless area where criminals and drug traffickers would not have thought twice about trading the al Qaeda leader for the bounty on offer by the United States of $25 million. Benotman says tribes around Jalalabad helped bin Laden hide after his escape and, like al-Afghani suggests, that he probably stayed in Afghanistan for about a year before crossing into Pakistani tribal territory. Bin Laden's escape from Tora Bora was the last stage of a three-month odyssey between the 9/11 attacks and the bombing of Tora Bora. The detainee profiles suggest that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 he was active meeting supporters, traveling between Kandahar and Kabul, and arranging for his wives and family members to escape U.S. bombing of Kandahar. And he was flush with cash. One document suggests he donated $100,000 to local tribal leaders around Jalalabad before heading to his Tora Bora redoubt. But as his hard core of supporters fled in disarray or were caught, he had to borrow $7,000 from Maulawi Mur Mohammed, the man who helped him flee from Tora Bora, according to al Afghani. It's unclear what happened to Mohammed. On a personal note, when I finally left the area just before Christmas 2001, I traveled with a Pakistani "fixer" working with CNN -- a man with encyclopedic knowledge of the region and its many local alliances and rivalries . As we drove from Jalalabad to the border with Pakistan, the mountains loomed on both sides: Tora Bora to the south and the wilds of Kunar in the distance to the north. Our fixer gestured north. "There are places up there where man has never set foot," he said. "I believe that's where bin Laden has gone." He may well have been right. CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.

Disney brings more oomph with New Fantasyland
By Sarah Sekula, Special to CNN
updated 11:22 AM EST, Mon December 10, 2012
Beast's Castle in Walt Disney World's New Fantasyland houses Be Our Guest, the first restaurant within the Magic Kingdom to offer alcoholic beverages. The decor inside the restaurant mirrors scenes from the animated movie "Beauty and the Beast."
The multi-year New Fantasyland expansion is the largest in the Magic Kingdom's 41-year history.
Inside Prince Eric's castle, the story of Ariel is captured with the attraction Under the Sea ~ Journey of The Little Mermaid. Inside, guests board giant clamshells as animation and animatronics retell Ariel's story.
Dumbo, The Flying Elephant rides are a big draw in the Storybook Circus area.
The revamped Dumbo ride has a new indoor lounge where guests receive a pager that virtually holds their place in line.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Walt Disney World's New Fantasyland officially opens December 6
The expansion is the largest in the Magic Kingdom's history
The new restaurant Be Our Guest is inspired by "Beauty and the Beast"
Orlando (CNN) -- When Walt Disney World's New Fantasyland opens Thursday in the Magic Kingdom, guests will be in for a slew of magical moments, and they'll have plenty of room to enjoy them. This portion of the park nearly doubled in size, making it the largest expansion in the park's 41-year history.
"It gives guests another level of immersion," says Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. "We have technology to play with that Walt DIsney didn't have."
For instance, part of the expansion includes Beast's Castle, which sits atop Be Our Guest restaurant. During lunch hours, guests order at touch-screen kiosks and take radio-frequency devices to their tables. Once the pager is placed on the table, servers know exactly where to deliver the food. And voila, meals arrive within minutes via a glass-enclosed cart.
"Everything is fresh, made to order, and for lunch we are hoping for the bustling kind of energy like the movie scene (from 'Beauty and the Beast') in the dining room," says Lenny DeGeorge, Walt Disney World executive chef.
Weatherman dances at Fantasyland
In the evening, the restaurant transforms into fancy table-service dining, inviting guests to feast upon French onion soup, mussels Provençal and charcuterie while sipping on French wines and beers. This is a first, since alcohol has never been served before in the Magic Kingdom.
In true Disney style, the decor inside and out is over the top. From the chandeliers to the walls to the terrazzo floor to the draperies, it's all true to the movie. Even suits of armor that whisper to passersby line the hallway. Guests then make their way into the grand ballroom, which has an entire wall of arched windows, complete with magical snowflakes falling upon the French countryside.
Faith Lee, from Lake Mary, Florida, appreciates the extreme theming. "I felt like a kid again entering (Be Our Guest restaurant)," she says. "It completely recreates the details of Beast's Castle to the most minute aspect."
Other areas of New Fantasyland involve similar attention to detail, completely immersing guests in the beloved Disney stories. The expansion, which has been in the works for more than three years, introduces two new areas ---- the Enchanted Forest, which focuses on Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, and Storybook Circus, an area inspired by the Disney animated feature "Dumbo."

Major focus on character time
Outside, to the far left of Beast's Castle is Maurice's Cottage, a provincial abode that houses an enchanted mirror. It spectacularly transforms into a portal whisking guests into the story of Beauty and the Beast. Once in the Beast's library, Enchanted Tales with Belle goes way beyond a typical meet and greet when Belle and friends invite guests to help act out the "tale as old as time."
Next door at Prince Eric's Castle, kids and adults alike will enjoy Under the Sea - Journey of the Little Mermaid (almost identical to the Disney California Adventure version). After walking through an interactive queue, guests board giant clamshells as animation and animatronics retell Ariel's story. Afterward in Ariel's Grotto, guests score one-on-one time with the redheaded mermaid herself as she poses for photos and signs autographs.
"For us, the Fantasyland expansion was more than we could have imagined," Lee says. "It was like being immersed in the stories of Belle and Ariel, not just visiting attractions."
Lee and her family were also impressed with Storybook Circus, which opened over the summer. This portion of the park includes a water play area, tame roller coaster and gift shop. The revamped Dumbo ride, with its new indoor queue lounge, is a crowd pleaser for parents who want to sit down for a bit and children who want to enjoy an elaborate playground. Guests receive a pager that virtually holds their place in line; it lights up when it's time to board the ride. Another option is to grab a FastPass and wait in a traditional line outdoors.
Overall, the new additions certainly have Disney fans aflutter, but will this translate to an influx of Orlando visitors?
Danielle Courtenay, chief marketing officer for Visit Orlando, thinks so.
"When any major new attraction opens in Orlando, there's always a positive impact in terms of increased awareness and interest in the destination," she says. "With New Fantasyland being the largest expansion in Magic Kingdom history, we are certainly optimistic that it will impact visitation for 2013 and beyond."
Coming soon
Princess Fairytale Hall is scheduled to open in 2013 in the former home of Snow White's Scary Adventures. Located in the Castle Courtyard in the center of Fantasyland, it will be a place for guests to meet Disney princess characters.
Come early 2014, the finishing touch will be a roller coaster, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, in the heart of it all. This family thrill ride will be an experience somewhere in between the tame Barnstormer, a re-themed "beginner's coaster," and the classic Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. With its patented train of vehicles that swing back and forth, the attraction will be the first of its kind.

2 women dead after being swept away in severe San Antonio flooding By Greg Botelho, CNN
updated 10:51 PM EDT, Sat May 25, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A woman swept away as firefighters tried to rescue her is found dead, spokesman says NEW: Her car was in the water when it struck her would-be rescuers' boat
She's the second woman in San Antonio to die due to the flooding Several rivers and creeks in and around the Texas city are well above flood stage
(CNN) -- Two women died Saturday -- one of them after being swept away moments after being inches from her would-be rescuers -- due to raging floodwaters in San Antonio, which braced for yet more drenching rains.
At one point Saturday, a storm and subsequent floods had knocked out power to about 12,000 customers and spurred the closure of dozens of streets in the Texas city and the surrounding county, authorities said.
Scores of people had to be evacuated due to floods and other issues, and Fire Chief Charles Hood noted there had been about 250 water-related calls -- in addition to ones for things like medical emergencies, accidents and more -- in the first 15 hours of Saturday.
The greatest concern had to do with people getting too close to fast-moving, deceptive and unpredictable floodwaters.
"We're asking folks to observe low-water crossing (warnings), to use common sense and to stay off the road if possible," Mayor Julian Castro said.
The first confirmed fatality -- a woman around age 30 -- was reported around 7:30 a.m. (8:30 a.m. ET), and her body was about three hours later, police Chief William McManus said.
Some time later, an older female driver went into water that was 4 feet above flood markers. Firefighters got to her vehicle and broke a window -- with one firefighter cutting his hand -- Hood explained. Then, as the would-be rescuers tried to get her from her vehicle, "the currents changed and washed that vehicle away," the fire chief said.
The woman's car had rolled on top of rescue boat, forcing out the firefighters who'd been in it, fire department spokesman Christian Bove later explained. By the time the firefighters were able to climb back into the boat, her car had become submerged in about 25-foot deep water and was gone.
Hood characterized authorities' subsequent efforts to find this woman as "a body recovery."
Described as being in her late 60s, the victim was found dead inside her vehicle around 6:45 p.m., Bove said.
"You can imagine how emotionally spent you are to try to rescue somebody, you're face-to-face with them, and then they're washed away," Hood said of his distraught firefighters, who'd gotten so close to rescuing the woman only to lose her.
The chief warned more people may be missing and perhaps dead. Firefighters happened to spot this woman going into the water before they rushed to rescue her; there may be others, Hood pointed out, who firefighters or others don't see get trapped in floodwaters.
"Turn around and don't drown," multiple officials repeated at a Saturday news conference.
The problems began with torrential rains late Friday that continued into Saturday, triggering flash-flood warnings across South Texas.
The weather was windy and wet and included a reported tornado on Friday in Bexar, just west of San Antonio, that knocked down trees and power lines and caused "minor building damage," according to the National Weather Service.
San Antonio International Airport received 9.57 inches of rain Saturday morning alone, CNN meteorologists said.
The city's Leon Creek was at 27.1 feet at 2:16 p.m. Saturday -- well above the flood stage of 15 feet.
"Disastrous flooding puts near 7 feet of flow in buildings in the jet engine test facility at Kelly AFB," the National Weather Service said. "Secondary and primary roads and bridges are severely flooded and dangerous to motorists above Highway 90 to below (Interstate 35)"
Flood warnings have also been issued for the San Antonio River, Medina River and Salado Creek, all of which are above flood stage. The weather service forecast that storms "could produce heavy rainfall" sometime after
In an interview with CNN affiliate KENS, San Antonio resident Mary Alice Galicia described how water enveloped her house.
"It was underwater 20 minutes ago," she said earlier Saturday. "I came over here. I own the property, and my daughter said that she couldn't get to her car. Her car's all flooded. The property -- the water's all swarming through the whole house. I just came over to check to see what I could do, but there's nothing that I can do right now."
Galicia doesn't have flood insurance because she "never imagined this would happen," she said.
"But it's not stopping. I thought it was gonna stop," she said about the water damage.
San Antonio's previous record flooding in 1998 was devastating, caused by heavy rains throughout south Texas and by a plume of moist air from Hurricane Madeline off the Mexican west coast. A total of 11 people died in San Antonio that weekend, with property damage estimates at $750 million, a city report said.
In all, the south Texas flooding killed 31 people during that October 1998 weekend: 26 drownings, two tornado deaths, two heart attacks and one electrocution-drowning, a federal report said. At least 17 of the drowning victims were in vehicles driving into the water or swept away by rising water, the U.S. Commerce Department report said.
CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Michael Martinez and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.

Who is Kenneth Bae, and why is he in a North Korean prison? - CNN.com

Who is Kenneth Bae, and why is he in a North Korean prison camp?
By Chelsea J. Carter, CNN
updated 9:13 PM EST, Tue January 7, 2014
This undated image provided by the U.S. Army shows Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who has been held by insurgents in Pakistan since 2009. Extremely sensitive discussions are under way with intermediaries overseas to see if there is any ability to gain his release, a U.S. official told CNN on February 19.
A North Korean court sentenced Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen, to 15 years of hard labor for committing "hostile acts" against the state. Those alleged acts were not detailed by the country's state-run news agency when it announced the sentence in May. Bae, here in a photo from a Facebook page titled Remember Ken Bae, was arrested in November 2012. "This was somebody who was a tour operator, who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North," a senior U.S. official told CNN.
Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson has been missing since 2007. His family says he was working as a private investigator in Iran when he disappeared, and multiple reports suggest Levinson may have been working for the CIA. His family told CNN in January that they have long known that Levinson worked for the CIA, and they said it's time for the government to lay out the facts about Levinson's case. U.S. officials have consistently denied publicly that Levinson was working for the government, but they have repeatedly insisted that finding him and bringing him home is a "top" priority.
Warren Weinstein, a contractor held by al Qaeda militants, is a U.S. citizen who has been held hostage in Pakistan since August 2011.
U.S. tourist and Korean War veteran Merrill Newman arrives at the Beijing airport Saturday, December 7, after being released by North Korea. Newman was detained October 26 by North Korean authorities just minutes before he was to depart the country after visiting through an organized tour. His son Jeff Newman says the Palo Alto, California, man had all the proper paperwork and set up his trip through a North Korean-approved travel agency. An Iranian court threw out a death penalty conviction in 2012 for Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine charged with spying. But he still remains in solitary confinement at Iran's notorious Evin Prison. Hekmati was detained in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother; his family and the Obama administration deny accusations that he was spying for the CIA.
Mexican authorities arrested Yanira Maldonado, a U.S. citizen, right, on May 22, for alleged drug possession. She and her husband, Gary, were traveling from Mexico back to the United States when their bus was stopped and searched. She was released on Friday, May 31, and is back in the United States.
Saeed Abedini, a 33-year-old U.S. citizen of Iranian birth, was sentenced to eight years in prison in January 2013, accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government and endangering national security by establishing home churches.
North Korea has arrested Americans before, only to release them after a visit by a prominent dignitary. Journalists Laura Ling, center, and Euna Lee, to her right, spent 140 days in captivity after being charged with illegal entry to conduct a smear campaign. They were freed in 2009 after a trip by former President Bill Clinton.
Former President Jimmy Carter negotiated the release of Aijalon Gomes, who was detained in 2010 after crossing into North Korea illegally from China. Analysts say high-level visits give Pyongyang a propaganda boost and a way to save face when it releases a prisoner.
Eddie Yong Su Jun was released by North Korea a month after he was detained in April 2011. His alleged crime was not provided to the media. The American delegation that secured his freedom included Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues.
Robert Park was released by North Korea in 2010 without any apparent U.S. intervention. The Christian missionary crossed into North Korea from China, carrying a letter asking Kim Jong Il to free political prisoners and resign. North Korea's state-run news agency said Park was released after an "admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings." Here, Park holds a photo of Kim and a malnourished child during a protest in Seoul.
Josh Fattal, center, Sarah Shourd, left, and Shane Bauer were detained by Iran while hiking near the Iraq-Iran border in July 2009. Iran charged them with illegal entry and espionage. Shourd was released on bail for medical reasons in September 2010; she never returned to face her charges. Bauer and Fattal were convicted in August 2011, but the next month they were released on bail and had their sentences commuted.
Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian-American scholar, was also detained at Evin Prison, spending months in solitary confinement before Iran released her on bail in August 2007. Esfandiari was visiting her ailing mother in Tehran when she was arrested and charged with harming Iran's national security. Alan Gross, at right with Rabbi Arthur Schneier, has been in Cuban custody since December 2009, when he was jailed while working as a subcontractor. Cuban authorities say Gross tried to set up illegal Internet connections on the island. Gross says he was just trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Former President Jimmy Carter and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson have both traveled to Cuba on Gross' behalf, but they were unable to secure his release.
Sixteen Americans were among the dozens arrested in December 2011 when Egypt raided the offices of 10 nongovernmental organizations that it said received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a public license. Many of the employees posted bail and left the country after a travel ban was lifted a few months later. Robert Becker, right, chose to stay and stand trial.
Freelance reporter James Foley went missing in November 2012 after his car was stopped by gunmen in Syria. He is likely being held by the Syrian government, according to the GlobalPost, an online international news outlet to which he contributed, and Foley's brother. Filmmaker Timothy Tracy was arrested in Venezuela in April on allegations of funding opponents of newly elected President Nicolas Maduro, successor to the late Hugo Chavez. Tracy went to Venezuela to make a documentary about the political division gripping the country. He was released in June.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Kenneth Bae's sister says Rodman was in a position to do some good and refused
Bae, 44, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in North Korea in 2012
He was convicted by North Korea of "hostile acts'' in 2013
Bae was sentenced to 15 years' hard labor
(CNN) -- Who is Kenneth Bae? And why is he being held by North Korea?
Those are the questions for many following the combative exchange Tuesday between Dennis Rodman and Chris Cuomo on CNN's "New Day," who asked whether the former NBA player was planning to inquire about Bae, a U.S. citizen sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp.
In response, Rodman, who is in North Korea with a team of fellow former NBA players, suggested the Korean-American had done something wrong, but did not specify what.
"Do you understand what he did in this country?" Rodman asked Cuomo. "No, no, no, you tell me, you tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country, why?"
Sister: Kenneth Bae is too weak to work
What's next for North Korea after Rodman? Rodman fiery on Kenneth Bae question
Here's a look at the case:
Who is Bae?
Born in South Korea, Bae immigrated at age 16 to the United States with his parents, his mother told CNN.
The 44-year-old Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, moved to China in 2005. A year later he established "Nations Tour," a China-based tour company that specialized in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website established by friends to promote his release.
Described by his sister, Terri Chung, as a devout Christian, Bae is married and the father of three children.
"Several years ago, Kenneth saw an opportunity that combined his entrepreneurial spirit with his personal convictions as a Christian," the website said. "He believed in showing compassion to the North Korean people by contributing to their economy in the form of tourism."
Bae had guided at least 15 tour groups, mostly made up of Americans and Canadians, into North Korea at the time of his arrest, his family has said.
What happened?
This much everybody appears to agree on: Bae was on the first day of a five-day tour when he was arrested November 3, 2012, in Rason, an area along the northeastern coast of North Korea that has been established by Pyongyang as a special economic zone to promote trade and investment.

U.S. officials have struggled to establish how exactly Bae ran afoul of North Korean authorities.
Word of Bae's arrest first surfaced in South Korea media reports days after he was detained, with the United States later confirming it.
Nearly two weeks after detaining Bae, North Korea's official news agency confirmed his arrest, saying only he was picked up for a crime against the state.
According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, KCNA, there was evidence uncovered that proved he had committed a crime against the country. Among the allegations: Bae was setting up bases in China to topple the North Korean government; he was encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government; and he was conducting a "malignant smear campaign."
In May, the government also accused Bae of planning a "Jericho operation" to bring down the government through religious activities.
The American confessed to the offenses, the government said.
What did he do? There has been speculation the evidence North Korea cites may in fact have been something Bae was carrying with him, perhaps a Bible or some other religious literature.
His mother, Myunghee Bae, who visited her son in North Korea in October, told CNN that her son was a devout Christian who had not understood the North Korean system. North Korea is officially an atheist state.
Bae's health
Imprisoned American's health failing
Sister: Kenneth Bae is too weak to work
North Korea is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent.
His mother and sister have told CNN that more than 10 months into Bae's sentence, his health is failing.
In a prison interview with Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korean group based in Tokyo, Bae had spoken of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. He looked noticeably thinner and wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt.
"Although my health is not good, I am being patient and coping well," he said at the time. "And I hope that with the help of the North Korean government and the United States, I will be released soon."
Bae was moved to a hospital for serious health problems, his sister told CNN in August.
In previous interviews, Chung has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain, kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. He was already dealing with diabetes.
His family says he has lost more than 50 pounds.
Bargaining chip?
The timing of Bae's conviction has raised questions about whether Pyongyang is using him as a bargaining chip in efforts to jump-start negotiations to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. Washington has previously accused North Korea of doing so to try to gain concessions.
New hope for detained Americans?
Bae's conviction followed North Korea's testing of a long-range rocket and an underground nuclear test, moves that resulted in tougher U.N. sanctions.
Tensions between North Korea and the United States have eased somewhat since the spring, when Pyongyang unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats as U.S. and South Korean troops carried out large-scale military exercises in the region.
U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae. In August, the two countries appeared close, but North Korea rescinded an invitation to a U.S. envoy. Ambassador Robert King, President Barack Obama's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, had been expected to fly to Pyongyang to try to win Bae's freedom.
In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary -- in recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.
But efforts by Bill Richardson, the former ambassador to the United Nations, were unsuccessful in winning Bae's release during a visit to North Korea last year.
Even Rodman, at one point, called on North Korea's Kim Jong Un to release Bae.
"I'm calling on the Supreme Leader of North Korea or as I call him "Kim," to do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose," Rodman said in a May 7 post to his Twitter account.
Rodman's rant
Rodman's rant garnered swift reaction, with Richardson telling CNN the basketball player "crossed a line this morning by implying that Kenneth Bae might be guilty, by suggesting there was a crime."
White House spokesman Jay Carney said he had heard about Rodman's outburst.
"I did not see some of the comments that Mr. Rodman made, but I am not going to dignify that outburst with a response," Carney said.
But the harshest criticism of Rodman came from Bae's sister, Chung.
"We couldn't believe our ears. He was in a position to do some good and help advocate for Kenneth, and refused to do so," Chung said on AC360.
"But then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against Kenneth. He clearly doesn't know anything about Kenneth, about his case. And so we were appalled by that."
