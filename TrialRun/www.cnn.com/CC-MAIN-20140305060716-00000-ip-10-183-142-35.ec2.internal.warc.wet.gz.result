Congress reacts to Gates' Pentagon budget shiftsStory Highlights NEW: Gates tells Jim Lehrer plan more about "rebalancing" than cutting Pentagon budget plan receives mixed reception from congressional Republicans Sen McCain says Gates' budget "is a major step in the right direction" Bipartisan group of senators urges Gates to not cut missile defense programs Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged Monday that proposed 2010 Pentagon budget cuts are likely to run into significant opposition on Capitol Hill, where politicians are concerned about preserving valuable defense contracts for their districts and states. The new Pentagon budget proposal received a mixed reception from Republicans on Monday. Gates said the new budget will reflect major changes in the "scope and significance" of the country's military priorities. The proposed budget cuts several traditional big-ticket items while investing in programs designed to bolster the military's ability to fight terrorists and other extremist elements in multiple regions at the same time. "This is a reform budget, reflecting lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan," Gates said. "There's no question that a lot of these decisions will be controversial." He called on Congress to "rise above parochial interests and consider what is in the best interests of the nation as a whole." Watch more of Gates' comments » Gates on Tuesday spoke to members of defense trade publications, Capitol Hill media and defense analysts from Washington think tanks, according to Pentagon officials. The secretary also recorded an interview for the PBS show "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer," to air Tuesday night. In that interview Gates tries to characterize his budget decisions in a friendlier tone than was portrayed by headlines such as Defense Daily's "Boeing Bloodied as Gates Proposes Slashing Missile Defense." "It's really not as much about cuts; I know that there's a lot of focus on cuts because of four or five major programs. But it's really a rebalancing: How do we sustain the capability not only to fight the wars we are in, but also how we preserve the hedge to fight any future conflict," Gates said in the PBS interview, according to a transcript released by the network. Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, acknowledged that representatives have concerns about job losses in their home districts but said that ultimately, "the national interest overrides anything." "The buck stops with us," he told CNN. "We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us." Some of the budgetary changes include a stronger institutional commitment to the military's all-volunteer force, a decision to "rebalance" defense programs to better fight current and future conflicts, and "fundamental overhauls" of the military's procurement, acquisition and contracting process. In what may be one of the most controversial parts of his proposed budget, Gates announced the cancellation or reduction of key elements of the Pentagon's missile defense system, including the installation of additional ground-based interceptor missiles in Alaska. The proposed overall missile defense system budget was trimmed by $1.4 billion. Don't Miss Gates announces major Pentagon priority shifts

During Gates' announcement, a bipartisan group of senators released a letter urging him "not to allow deep cuts in U.S. missile defense programs that are critically important to protecting our homeland and our allies against the growing threat of ballistic missiles." "The threat from ballistic missiles is significant and on the rise. [It] has been underscored by Iran and North Korea's recent missile tests," they said. Among others, the letter was signed by both senators from Alaska: Republican Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Mark Begich. While Gates was initially appointed Pentagon chief by former President George W. Bush, his overall budget received what appeared to be a mixed reception from congressional Republicans. "Republicans appreciate Secretary Gates' effort to shape the Department of Defense so that we more effectively fight the wars our troops are engaged in today. However, we are concerned about the trade-offs involved in rebalancing the Department," New York Rep. John McHugh, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a written statement. "It remains the Congress' responsibility to provide for the common defense," he warned. However, Sen. John McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate, said Gates' budget "is a major step in the right direction." "It has long been necessary to shift spending away from weapon systems plagued by scheduling and cost overruns to ones that strike the correct balance between the needs of our deployed forces and the requirements for meeting the emerging threats of tomorrow," he said. "I believe Secretary Gates' decision is key to ensuring that the defense establishment closes the gap between the way it supports current operations and the way it prepares for future conventional threats." Georgia Republicans, however, slammed President Obama for Gates' announcement about the phase-out of the F-22 Raptor, which is assembled in Cobb County, Georgia. Rep. Tom Price, whose district includes the Raptor production facility, called the cut "outrageous" and said Obama's "priorities are deeply flawed." Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss said he was "disappointed" in the cuts and accused the administration of being "willing to sacrifice the lives of American military men and women for the sake of domestic programs." Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, was also dismissive of the F-22 phase-out, although he said he generally supported Gates' moves to modernize the military. Some F-22 production takes place in Connecticut as well. The proposed overall fiscal year 2010 Defense Department budget is almost $534 billion, or nearly $664 billion including the costs of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The current Pentagon budget totals slightly more than $513 billion, or almost $655 billion including the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.

Donna Liu: 'They lowered their rifles and started to shoot'Next Article in World » Read PHOTOS By Daniela Deane Special to CNN (CNN) -- Donna Liu, then a CNN producer based in Atlanta, was on a leave of absence on a fellowship, when she ended up in Beijing in early April 1989 -- and called CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Mike Chinoy to see if he needed any help with the summit visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to China. Donna Liu inside the Beijing Hotel in 1989. "You could hear the gunfire before you saw anything."more photos » She had driven through Tiananmen Square and had seen the first banners made by students asking for reform. As a Chinese-American, and a long-time China watcher, Liu was intrigued. "Mike said 'sure, come on in,'" Liu recalls. Neither of them knew then what was coming. "When I signed onto the story, I thought it was a summit." Fast forward to the night of June 3. Liu was in Tiananmen Square with camerawoman Cynde Strand when they first heard the gunfire. "You could hear the gunfire before you saw anything," she said. "The first conflict happened further west of there. "Then people began running some of the wounded back through the square, trying to go east. Others went in other directions. Some kids were coming back with blood on their hands, trying to help other kids. We shot (filmed) some of those. We talked to some of those people, we got their descriptions of what had happened." Don't Miss Tiananmen a watershed story for CNN
Mike Chinoy: TV news was going to change everything
Cynde Strand: We knew it was coming, and we survived
Vito Maggiolo: I challenged the Chinese
Liu grabbed the tapes and tried to make her way back to "Tokyo base," the nickname for the room at the Beijing Hotel where CNN had set up a makeshift bureau as close as they could to the square. See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 » "As I was running from the monument (in the center of Tiananmen Square), the first truck of soldiers with rifles showed up at the northwest corner of the square," she said. "They lowered their rifles and started to shoot. I went out the eastern side. I believe they had deliberately left that open as an escape route. They were shooting to clear people off. They didn't seem to be aiming at anyone in particular." Liu finally made it back the quarter-mile to the Beijing Hotel. "When I walked through the front door, I was grabbed by Chinese security," she recalls. "They threw me against the wall, took my bag, and took the tapes." "Those were the most dramatic pictures of the night," said Strand. "And they were confiscated." Donna Liu is now Director for Strategic Initiatives at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs

Poll: Americans place blame for partisanship Is our Government broken?STORY HIGHLIGHTS Sixty-seven percent of respondents say GOP not doing enough to help President Obama Fifty-two percent say Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with GOP, poll says Fifty-four percent say Democrats should take the first step toward bipartisan solutions Tune in to CNN all this week for a special series, "Broken Government" Washington (CNN) -- Two-thirds of Americans think that the Republicans in Congress are not doing enough to cooperate with President Obama, according to a new national poll. But a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey, released Wednesday, also indicates the public believes the Democrats should be the ones to take the first step toward bipartisan cooperation and they want the Democrats to give up more than the GOP to reach a consensus. Sixty-seven percent of respondents say the GOP is not doing enough to cooperate with the White House, up 6 points from last April. Americans appear split on whether the president is doing enough to reach out to Republicans, with 52 percent saying Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with the GOP, while 47 percent say he is doing enough to reach across the political aisle. The 52 percent who say the president's not doing enough to encourage bipartisanship is up 16 points from last April. Video: Debating voter frustration

"That's a big change from last spring, when Obama was still in the honeymoon phase of his first term," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "Congressional Republicans were familiar to Americans, but Obama was new to them, so his early attempts to reach out to the GOP continued to resonate even after it became clear that bipartisanship was not within easy reach." Even though more people think Republicans are not doing enough to reach bipartisan consensus, 54 percent believe the Democratic party should take the first step toward developing bipartisan solutions to the country's problems, the survey says. Forty-two percent say the GOP should take that first step. Just over half of those questioned say the Democrats should give up more ground to achieve bipartisanship, while 43 percent want to see the GOP make more compromises. "Americans feel the ball is in the Democrats' court," Holland added. "They may not be held responsible for the problem, but since they are in charge of the government, Americans appear to think they are responsible for the solution." According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey.CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

Del Potro rampant in Rotterdam
updated 1:09 PM EST, Sun February 17, 2013
Juan Martin Del Potro defeated France's Julian Benneteau to clinch the title at the Rotterdam Open.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Juan Martin Del Potro wins the Rotterdam Open in Holland
World No.7 defeated France's Julien Benneteau in straight sets
Del Potro becomes second Argentine to win tournament Benneteau has lost in all eight of his ATP tour final appearances
(CNN) -- Juan Martin del Potro banished the pain of last year's final defeat by Roger Federer after winning the Rotterdam Open title Sunday.
The Argentine defeated France's Julien Benneteau 7-6 6-3 to claim his fourth indoor tournament victory, despite having to play the final game with cotton wool stuffed up his nostril following a nosebleed.
And the 2009 U.S. Open champion, who was seeded second, was thrilled with the 14th ATP title triumph of his career, following last year's failure in the final.

Djokovic: 'My dreams came true'
"It feels amazing, it was a big goal for me to win this title after losing the final last year," he told reporters.
"I'm so happy to be the champion. I'm feeling very confident with my serve, hopefully for the rest of the season. Today I did lose serve for the first time this week, but finals are tough to play.
"I played perhaps my worst tennis of the week at the start of the match, I came out very nervous, but I fought back. Later on I started feeling very confident and in control all the time.
"I will try to keep on winning; I'm looking forward to my next event. It's a big challenge for me this season to try and move closer to the number one position."
Williams eyes Azarenka final
Del Potro, who is currently ranked seventh in the world, is the second Argentine to win in Rotterdam after Guillermo Vilas, who triumphed in 1982 and finished runner-up the following year.
Benneteau had hoped to become the fifth Frenchman to win the title after recording a shock victory over Roger Federer in the semifinal.
But the 31-year-old, who has lost all eight ATP title finals, was unable to break his duck on this occasion.
"I can only congratulate Juan Martin," he told reporters.
"I did my best, but he was just too good for me today. He was too strong. I will still fight to finally try and win a trophy."

FIFA chief Blatter's Twitter account hacked
updated 1:43 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2013
FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been the victim of hacking after his Twitter account was hijacked
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
FIFA president Sepp Blatter's Twitter account hacked
Hackers also write bogus messages on official Twitter page for 2016 World Cup
A fake Twitter account recently threatened to disclose confidential FIFA documents
Blatter's 15-year tenure as FIFA president has divided opinion
(CNN) -- The head of world soccer Sepp Blatter has again been caught up in controversy -- but this time it was all the fault of a fake FIFA president.
Blatter's Twitter account was hacked on Monday as was FIFA's official account for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
As well saying he was stepping down as FIFA president, the bogus tweets referred to Blatter and Qatar's winning 2022 World Cup bid.
"Some FIFA accounts, including @SeppBlatter and @fifaworldcup, have been hacked," said FIFA in a statement.
A group calling themselves the Syrian Electronic Army -- said to be supportive of the country's leader Bashar Al-Assad -- claimed responsibility for hacking the accounts.
"This sort of attack is about getting a point across," Sian John, security strategist at software and security firm Symantec, told CNN.
"Hacking comes back to manipulation. Some groups do it to gain money and some of them to do it to get a point across. There are different motivating factors."
Quickfire questions with Sepp Blatter
Last month, the Syrian Electronic Army hacked into several of British broadcaster the BBC's accounts.
FIFA President denies racism in football
Prior to the hacking of Blatter, another Twitter account emerged -- @Fifnonymous -- which threatened to disclose confidential FIFA documents, though it was quickly deleted or suspended.
It is unclear whether the account was genuine or a hoax.
The announcement by FIFA in 2010 that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup finals has brought greater exposure for the tiny emirate.
In particular the plight of the country's migrant workers, who make up 90 per cent of Qatar's population, has been highlighted by the International Trade Union Confederation. The ITUC has called for FIFA to strip Qatar of the 2022 World Cup unless it significantly improves its record on worker rights. The ITUC points to Qatar's system of sponsorship which ties workers to employers and has been abused in the past. They also point to the high number of worker deaths and the conditions that many find themselves in. Temperatures on building sites in the summer months can hit 50 degree Celcius. Qatar's economy has boomed since it started exporting liquefied natural gas in 1997 -- only Luxembourg has a higher gross domestic product per capita. But the 2022 World Cup has sparked a construction boom in a race to ready Qatar's infrastructure for the tournament. Qatar's ambitious plans include building brand new, state of the art stadiums that would rival any in the world. To combat the intense desert heat in the summer, each stadium would be equipped with zero carbon cooling technology that would cool the pitch and the stands. But costs have spiraled and the technology has yet to be successfully deployed in full. Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee recently requested that the number of new stadiums it builds be reduced to eight or nine from the currently planned 12.
The Qataris have also been busy investing in football abroad. The Qatar Investment Authority bought a majority shareholding in French football club Paris Saint-Germain in May 2011, immediately making it one of the richest teams in Europe. Ex-Milan and Inter coach Leonardo, center, was appointed director of football, while Carlo Ancelotti (left) is now coach.
Qatar has its own 12-team top division, with the leading four clubs at the end of the season going into the Qatar Crown Prince Cup. Football is the most popular sport in the kingdom, with nearly 700,000 attending matches in any one season.
Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani (left), a member of the Qatari royal family, bought Spanish club Malaga for €36 million ($48 million) in June 2010. The investment brought with it a place in this season's UEFA Champions League. Malaga went on to reach the quarterfinals. Al Sadd's victory in the 2011 Asian Champions League final vindicated Qatar's decision to plough money into its coaching set-up rather than splash out on top overseas names. Just five of Al Sadd's playing roster were non-Qatari nationals.
Mohammed bin Hammam, Qatar's former high-ranking member of FIFA's executive committee as president of the Asian Football Confederation, was banned from football after being found guilty of trying to bribe delegates ahead of the 2011 presidential election in which he was to be Sepp Blatter's only opponent.
The issue of how migrant workers are treated has long been a hot topic in the Gulf. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain have all been criticized in the past for their poor treatment of guest workers. But the 2022 World Cup has focused attention on Qatar. Here one Indian worker proudly shows his ticket for a match at the 2011 Asian Cup finals, hosted in Doha. Thousands of Indian workers were given the day off by their employers and given free tickets to watch India play at the tournament, even though most were ardent cricket fans. Many spoke of their relief at working in Doha, rather than any of the other Gulf cities near by. Race for the prize

"At no time did an account with this name come up in any discussions with Twitter," a FIFA spokesman told CNN.
Other high-profile victims of hacking include Burger King and Jeep, whose Twitter accounts were both hijacked in February.
Twitter's own systems were hacked earlier this year, with attackers gaining access to usernames as well as encrypted and randomized passwords for about 250,000 users.
"As we are online so much more now, I'd expect to see more high-profile attacks," added John.
"It's not a reason to panic but a reason to take a step back and think how we should protect ourselves online.
"I spend most of my time trying to encourage companies to make information security a priority. People used to see it as an IT problem -- but now they see it as a business problem.
"The challenge for businesses now is how they manage the impact on their brand if they were to have an attack."
Blatter may have been targeted because he divides opinion, regularly attracting controversy over his leadership but also helping promote soccer across the globe.
A series of corruption scandals within FIFA, his botched re-election campaign -- where his only opponent was barred from standing after another corruption scandal -- and the failure of England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup to attract any interest in FIFA's corridors of power (despite having the best technical report) led to an outpouring of criticism of Blatter.
However, his dedication to grassroots football and the game's growth in Africa, the Middle East and Asia are widely regarded as positives of his presidency.
When Blatter joined the federation, 146 countries were members. Now, there are 209 member nations, earning Fifa the nickname the "United Nations of Football".
Despite the embarrassment for FIFA and Blatter, security expert John urged him to continue tweeting.
Password panic
"Open attacks are most often down to the users themselves," John explained. "Strong passwords are crucial to prevent hacking.
"I ask friends five questions and if any of the answers they give me are part of their passwords then they have failed the test.
"The questions are spouse's name, significant birthdays, favorite sporting team, siblings and pet's name. Many a dog has died and lived on in a password.
"The key is not panicking. There's no need to stay off social media or the internet -- it's about thinking about the dangers.
"Secure your password, don't use social media on free public wifi, don't let people see what you're typing -- and don't say something on social media which you wouldn't be prepared to shout out at in a public space."
A Twitter spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the hacking of the Blatter and FIFA's accounts.
FIFA president since 1998 , the 77-year-old Blatter has not yet announced whether he will be standing for a fifth term when his current term ends in 2015.
But if he does, he may want to set a new password first.

House panel says IRS official waived 5th Amendment right
By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 1:50 PM EDT, Sun June 30, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Partisan vitriol flows at a House Oversight Committee hearing A GOP legislator says IRS official Lois Lerner thumbed her nose at Congress
Democrats say a GOP resolution threatens Lerner's constitutional rights
The resolution says Lerner waived her right against self-incrimination
Washington (CNN) -- Republicans on a House committee rejected strenuous Democratic objections in voting Friday that Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner waived her constitutional right against self-incrimination at a prior hearing.
The resolution was the first step in an effort by Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee, to force Lerner to return to answer questions about targeting of conservative groups by the unit she headed.
It passed on a 22-17 vote, with every Republican in favor and every Democrat opposed, following an unusually vitriolic hearing.
Democrats accused Issa of a partisan witch hunt that threatened Lerner's 5th Amendment rights, while Republicans seethed at how Lerner had first declared her innocence before refusing to answer questions on constitutional grounds at the earlier hearing.
Issa's resolution is likely to set off a lengthy legal back-and-forth with Lerner and her attorneys that could include her eventual appearance at another hearing, where committee members agreed she would again assert her 5th Amendment rights.
That could then lead to efforts to cite her for contempt of Congress.
Lerner headed the IRS unit that targeted some conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Disclosure of the targeting in an inspector general's report in early May set off a political firestorm, leading to investigations by the FBI, congressional committees, the inspector general and the IRS itself.
Republicans grill acting IRS chief over targeting probe
Under subpoena to testify before Issa's panel on May 22, Lerner instead made a statement that declared she did nothing wrong, and then invoked her 5th Amendment right. Issa dismissed her, but warned the committee might call her back.
Friday's hearing was the first step toward forcing Lerner to appear again. If approved, Issa's resolution would set the stage for requesting her to come back and testify because she had waived her 5th Amendment right in the view of the committee.
"I believe Lois Lerner waived her 5th Amendment privileges," Issa said. "She did so when she voluntarily chose to deliver an opening statement" that included what he described as "four specific denials ....at the core of the committee's investigation into this matter."
Other Republicans called Lerner's actions an arrogant rejection of congressional authority.
"Lois Lerner is in fact the poster child for thumbing her nose, a federal bureaucrat thumbing her nose at Congress," declared GOP Rep. John Mica of Florida, later calling the matter "a showdown, really, in who's in control of the government and whether we honor the Constitution."
Democrats strenuously objected to the resolution, calling it a political gesture and asking for the committee to first hold a hearing on the legal basis for the finding that Lerner had waived her constitutional right.
Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said Issa's resolution would hinder efforts to compel Lerner to testify if the matter ends up in court over an eventual contempt of Congress citation.
"I think what we're doing today will doom our effort to hold Ms. Lerner accountable," Lynch said, adding some Democrats would have supported Issa "if you did it properly."
Instead, "we have not had the meaningful, deliberate process that would give weight to our decision," he added, calling Friday's hearing "a political process."
Another Democrat, Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, called the "back-and-forth political bickering" at Friday's hearing "an embarrassment." He accused Issa of conducting "witch hunts" instead of seeking solutions to the problems at the IRS cited by the inspector general's report.
"These are the issues that the American people want us to focus on, not more partisan arguing and gridlock," Horsford said, adding that Issa's resolution does nothing to fix the improper targeting.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the elected House delegate from the District of Columbia, said she and other Democrats agreed with Republicans that Lerner's testimony would be vital to the panel's investigation of the targeting scandal.
"I hope we can find a way to get to the real point, perhaps by offering her some kind of immunity," Norton said.
Issa responded that the committee first had to take the procedural step of concluding Lerner's testimony from the May 22 hearing, which remained open. Only then could the panel try to strike an immunity deal, he said.
When Norton persisted in questioning Issa about the matter, he abruptly declared her allotted five minutes to speak had expired and moved on.
In another sharp exchange, Issa argued with Democratic Rep. John Tierney of Massachusetts over a GOP memo that included a request that it not be distributed to all of the committee's Democrats to reduce the risk of it becoming public.
Tierney asked Issa which members he didn't want to see the memo, but Issa avoided the question and cut him off, saying, "The gentleman's time has expired."
IRS targeting scandal reshaped by new details
"Well, the gentleman's excuse is lame," Tierney shot back.
Republicans have tried to maintain public focus on the evolving IRS targeting scandal, inferring it could reach to the top levels of the Obama administration.
No evidence so far shows political motivation or any involvement from outside the IRS, according to the inspector general's report that revealed the targeting and the acting IRS director appointed last month by President Barack Obama to clean up the mess.
Both liberal and conservative groups were flagged by the IRS when assessing their eligibility for a tax break available to social welfare organizations.
However, only conservative groups faced delayed processing and inappropriate questioning about political activity that would make them ineligible, according to IRS Principal Deputy Commissioner Daniel Werfel and a letter by J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.
IRS screeners used conservative-themed criteria such as a group using the words "tea party" on "Be on the Lookout," or BOLO, lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible.
Another category of the BOLO lists also had liberal-themed criteria, including the word "progressives," but that category didn't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity, George's letter said.
Under tough questioning Thursday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Werfel acknowledged that the different BOLO categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation.
Werfel repeatedly cautioned that his internal review was incomplete, and that additional information from continuing investigations will be needed to reach definitive conclusions.
He noted that 80 groups that have waited more than 120 days for a final decision on their applications for a tax break represent a diverse range of political leanings.
All involved in Thursday's meeting agreed Werfel needs more time to figure out exactly what happened, who was responsible and why.
That didn't stop Republicans from criticizing his efforts so far. Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the Ways and Means panel's GOP chairman, said Werfel's report lacked accountability and reached unsubstantiated conclusions of no political motivation.
"If there is anything this report shows, it's just how much more work must be done," Camp said, noting that Werfel had yet to interview principal figures or get other information necessary to determine the origins or scope of the targeting.
Another GOP legislator, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, called Werfel's report "a sham."
Werfel said the FBI and inspector general are handling interviews of IRS officials involved in the targeting, adding that the investigations could involve criminal behavior.
He repeated the assertion in his report that no evidence so far suggests intentional wrongdoing by agency personnel or influence from outside the IRS in the targeting.
His report, released Monday, said five managers had been replaced and other steps were taken in response to George's audit last month that set off a political firestorm in Washington.
Republican leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general's audit indicates political villainy by the Obama administration to try to stifle opponents, such as groups with "tea party" in their names that were flagged for additional IRS scrutiny.
Democrats said Thursday that such allegations are politically motivated instead of based on any evidence. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the panel, asked Werfel if there is any evidence of White House involvement in the targeting, and Werfel answered there is not.
CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Dana Bash contributed to this report.

Supreme Court must protect our privacy from the government
By Marc Rotenberg, Special to CNN
updated 11:30 AM EDT, Wed July 17, 2013
Marc Rotenberg asks: it legal for the government to collect information about people posing no national security threat?
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Marc Rotenberg: Electonic Privacy group wants Supreme Court to step in on privacy
He says secret court order makes Verizon give call record info to National Security Agency
He says: Patriot Act powers can only be used in certain circumstances
Rotenberg: Supreme Court has ultimate authority to say what law allows -- and it is not this
Editor's note: Marc Rotenberg is President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and teaches information privacy law at Georgetown University Law Center. He frequently testifies before Congress on emerging privacy issues.
(CNN) -- Last week the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a petition with the Supreme Court asking it to stop the government's collection of telephone records of Verizon customers. It was not a decision we took lightly. But as an organization dedicated to protecting privacy, we had no choice.
Of all the recent revelations about the government's surveillance activities, the most significant is a secret court order that required Verizon to provide to the National Security Agency -- on an ongoing basis -- the call detail records on all of its customers.
Marc Rotenberg
Not since the congressional hearings of the Church Committee -- the Senate committee that investigated widespread intelligence abuses in the 1970s -- has there been evidence of such extensive spying by the U.S. government on the American public. But unlike then, the digital data of the modern telephone network allows for an extraordinary sorting and sifting of digital information today.
A phone number is easily linked to a person, perhaps a doctor, a minister, a family member, or a close friend. Call detail records can also reveal where people are and who they are with. Such information can be very useful when tracking a particular target in a criminal or intelligence investigation, but collecting such data on all Americans who have a telephone is without precedent.
In our filing with the Supreme Court, the Electronic Privacy Information Center asked a simple question that we hope the Court will answer: Is it legal for the government to collect so much information about so many people suspected of no threat to national security?
According to the law -- section 215 of the Patriot Act -- the government is only allowed to obtain such information if it is "relevant" to an "authorized investigation" and if its use is for very narrow purposes. How could it possibly be that all of the customers of Verizon could be subject to an authorized investigation of the U.S. government?
To us that seems impossible. And that is also the view of some of those who wrote the law and who served on the court that applies the law.
NSA spying on your calls
Secret spying: From critic to supporter Brok: NSA's spying on EU 'out of control'
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, the original author of the Patriot Act, recently said he was "extremely disturbed" about the news of the Verizon order and said it was "not consistent with the Patriot Act."
Retired Judge James Robertson, who served on the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, said he was "stunned" to learn about the court's broad authorities.
The views of Sensenbrenner and Robertson are shared by many legal scholars. It is simply inconceivable that Congress could grant legal authority for the routine surveillance of all of our telephone records.
And the secrecy surrounding these activities -- not only was the court order kept secret, but so too was the legal justification -- should set off alarm bells. If the government has a good justification for the program, it should not be difficult to provide a public explanation, even if some of the details must be withheld.
Some are surprised that our organization went directly to the Supreme Court. They point out that the Supreme Court prefers hearing disputes after the issues have been considered by lower courts. But under the special rules of the secret court that issued the Verizon order, we had no choice. Only the government or Verizon could have objected to the order of the secret court. They didn't, so we turned to the one Court that has the ultimate authority to say what the law allows.
And if there is one case that justifies review under the Supreme Court's "mandamus" standard, our organization's challenge to the NSA's domestic surveillance program is that case.
Over the next month, we look forward to working with legal scholars, technical experts and others who have expressed support for our petition. They will be filing friend of the court briefs to explain to the Supreme Court in more detail the important issues in our case. We anticipate that the Court will consider our arguments when it returns in early October.
Still, there is more to do. We believe that the NSA's decision to undertake domestic surveillance has also triggered a provision of law that requires the agency to take public comments. We believe that the public should have the opportunity to express its views on the program. Whether you oppose or support the NSA's domestic surveillance program, your views should be heard.
