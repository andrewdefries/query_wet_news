(CNN) -- Bobby Darin lived his life as if every minute truly would be his last, literally sucking oxygen after vigorous, all-stops-out performances to keep his weakened heart going. He died in 1973 at age 37.Elliott Smith lived his life, particularly towards the end, as if his psychic pain were a heavy chain strapped to his legs. His death in 2003, at age 34, was an apparent suicide.One would think that Darin's bold life would make the more colorful book, but it's the biography of Smith, Benjamin Nugent's "Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing" (Da Capo), that does justice to its subject.In contrast, David Evanier's "Roman Candle" (Rodale) is rather shallow, and despite Evanier's bona fides -- his book on singer Jimmy Roselli was shortlisted for the prestigious Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award -- "Roman Candle" reads like a record label biography padded out to book form.Versatile to a faultThat's too bad, because Darin's life had the blaze of a supernova. Raised in poor circumstances, a sickly child, Darin knew his days were numbered. He hustled and he slaved, and by 22 he had hit the Top Ten with the novelty rock number "Splish Splash." A year later, his cover of the Kurt Weill song "Mack the Knife" was the No. 1 song of the year.He sold out the top nightclubs. He was a golden boy. He even had a (short-lived) celebrity marriage, to film star Sandra Dee.But Darin was almost too versatile; he wanted to be the consummate entertainer but wasn't quite charismatic enough to be at the top of any form. His swing was not quite Sinatra's and his growl was not quite Elvis'. Darin could act -- he was nominated for an Oscar -- but he didn't devote himself to the craft. After the British Invasion hit in 1964, he struggled to find his place in the musical landscape, with just one Top Ten hit thereafter (1966's gentle "If I Were a Carpenter").Darin's life was one electric jolt after another -- besides his performing talent, his family hid some strange secrets -- but Evanier glides over events, dampening their impact. He's too dependent on Darin boosters, particularly mercurial Darin friend/manager Steve Blauner and publicist Harriet Wasser; and he gets names and dates wrong, calling longtime Warner Bros. Records head Mo Ostin "Moe Austin," actor Melvyn Douglas "Melvin," placing the Watts Riots in 1964 (they were in 1965) and remarking that Darin was rehearsing for a TV show on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, "November 23 [sic], 1963."Most embarrassingly, there are passages like this: "Where the hell did he come from?" Evanier writes, saying Darin "fit right in" with the likes of Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jack Benny and George Burns despite being many years their junior. "Some questions about the nature of genius can never be answered or resolved."A spectral presence"Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing" doesn't get very close to its subject, either. But it's not for lack of trying. One gets the feeling Nugent was trying to heal his own heavy heart by embarking on a search for Elliott Smith, and though we only get glimpses of the rather private musician, that's usually enough.Smith, raised near Dallas, Texas, first gained note with his Portland, Oregon, band Heatmiser, then cut a pair of raw, personal albums -- "Roman Candle" (of all things) and "Either/Or" -- in the mid-'90s. His song "Miss Misery," featured in "Good Will Hunting," was nominated for an Oscar, and he suddenly was a leading alt-music light, hailed for his songwriting. He was a talented multi-instrumentalist, too, playing most of the instruments on his 1998 breakthrough album, "XO."But Smith was also a lonely and grasping soul -- Nugent recounts stories of his wandering through subway tunnels, equipped with a Walkman, or running into the darkness in an alcoholic daze -- and lost himself in drink and drugs. Just when he appeared to be coming out of his tailspin, he was found dead, a kitchen knife in his chest. His death has been ruled a suicide, though some people are convinced he was murdered.Nugent sometimes gets a little too insider-y -- too many details about too many '90s indie bands -- and his insistences on Smith's sense of humor, though no doubt true, ring hollow.Still, if Smith is a spectral figure -- and he seems less to inhabit the book than haunt it -- Nugent manages to gather enough of his spirit to provide a clear picture of his talent and impact without overstating his case.On the other hand, Evanier's presentation of Darin's life is superficial and fawning; one wonders what Wil Haygood, who wrote last year's perceptive Sammy Davis Jr. bio "In Black and White," could have done with the material.Both musicians had their moment of importance, and interesting lives. But only Smith has received the thoughtful treatment he deserves.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Woman accused of using cruise line job for burglariesBy Rich Phillips, CNN Bethsaida Sandoval has been charged with 24 counts of burglary. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFormer Royal Caribbean worker charged in 24 burglariesPolice say she used her position to access vacation informationBurglaries took place on first night of cruises, authorities say

Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A former Royal Caribbean Cruise Line employee has been arrested and charged with burglarizing the homes of 24 vacationers who were spending time at sea. Police in Palm Beach County say the employee accessed personal information about reservations to find out when the vacationers would be away. Bethsaida Sandoval, 38, a Royal Caribbean vacation planner, has been charged with 24 counts of burglary across Palm Beach County, including Boca Raton, Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Sandoval's husband, John Lopez, acted as her accomplice, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. According to the probable cause affidavit, Sandoval admitted that she and her husband were involved in the burglaries. Her position gave her full access to victims' home addresses. "People were on vacation, and when they returned home, they found they were burglarized," said Teri Barbera, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. "One common factor was that they were all on vacation with Royal Caribbean." Sandoval allegedly told police that she printed or wrote down personal information on customers and gave the information to Lopez. The affidavit says Sandoval stated that she and her husband would then go to the houses and burgle them. Lopez is being held on an unrelated charge in nearby Broward County. He's expected to be charged soon in the string of burglaries, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Investigators believe that the burglaries took place on the first night of the cruises, while the homeowners were at sea. The ships departed from the Port of Miami or Port Everglades, in Fort Lauderdale, according to the probable cause affidavit. The sheriff's office says Royal Caribbean has fully cooperated with the investigation. A cruise line spokeswoman, Cynthia Martinez, said Sandoval was fired for her actions. "Royal Caribbean does not tolerate any form of criminal activity in its workforce or operations," it said in a statement. "This is a situation involving a former employee who appears to have taken advantage of their position for personal gain. Royal Caribbean cooperated fully with authorities during this investigation and will continue providing any assistance necessary to prosecute this individual to the fullest extent of the law." The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says the investigation, which took place over several months, revealed that high-dollar amounts of property, money and firearms were stolen. According to the affidavit, Sandoval was seen entering the Royal Caribbean building after hours, about 1 a.m. The time was documented by her door access swipe card and her computer login as she accessed the Royal Caribbean system. "This is not normal business practice and Bethsaida Sandoval should not be in the building, or accessing Royal Caribbean computer systems at that time of night," reads the affidavit. Authorities said Sandoval told them that she would drive and Lopez would get out of the car and use a center punch, a small tool for punching holes, to smash out the glass of a rear sliding-glass door. The affidavit says she gave the center punch to investigators. The cruise line said in its statement, "We regret this incident occurred and hope it does not overshadow the excellent work our more than 40,000 Royal Caribbean employees do every day to provide our guests with memorable and outstanding cruise vacation experiences." The cruise line says it is reaching out to apologize to all guests who were affected.

Defiant Taliban accuse U.S. of crimes as Americans mark 9/11 By the CNN Wire Staff The effect of 9/11 on AfghanistanSTORY HIGHLIGHTSThe Taliban accuse the U.S. of "shedding the blood of tens of thousands" of AfghansThe terror attacks of September 11 are a murky pretext for the violence, they sayThe Afghan people have the stamina to fight on, the Taliban sayU.S. and coalition forces have been battling the Taliban for almost a decade Kabul (CNN) -- The Taliban have accused the United States of killing tens of thousands of Afghans and brutally torturing others in a defiant statement marking the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks against the United States. The statement accuses the United States of using the September 11 attacks as a pretext for violence against Muslims. It says the Afghan people have "an endless stamina for a long war" and could rise up as a nation "to send the Americans to the dustbin of history." "It will remain a permanent stigma on the face of the Western democracy that America and her allies martyred tens of thousands of Muslims under the pretext of this ambiguous and murky event," the statement says, referring to 9/11.

Children, old men, women and babies are among the victims of U.S.-led attacks in Afghanistan, which also destroy homes, villages and orchards "under the unjustified name of war on terror," the Taliban say. The statement comes as the United States remembers the events of 10 years ago and intelligence officials warn of a "credible" threat of another attack on U.S. soil. U.S. and international forces have been battling the Taliban in Afghanistan for almost a decade, with the loss of almost 2,700 lives across the coalition, more than 1,700 of them American. Figures released by the United Nations mission in Afghanistan for the first six months of this year showed 1,462 civilians had died, with anti-government insurgents responsible for 80% of the killings. While air strikes were the leading cause of civilian deaths at the hands of international forces, the majority of those who died as a result of insurgent action were killed by homemade explosive devices and suicide attacks, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan report said. The U.S.-led bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001, within weeks of the attacks on New York and Washington D.C., as American forces sought al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The Taliban were forced from government soon afterward but continue to lead the insurgency against NATO-led forces in Afghanistan. Taliban leaders granted bin Laden sanctuary in Afghanistan for several years, despite U.S. requests for his extradition over previous terror attacks, and declined to hand him over when he became the main suspect in the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban, Islamic fundamentalists who come mainly from Afghanistan's Pashtun ethnic group, rose to power in Afghanistan in the 1990s after the Soviet withdrawal from the country. They gave bin Laden, exiled from his native Saudi Arabia, a safe haven in Afghanistan from 1996 and allowed his al Qaeda followers to live and set up training camps there. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.

Despite protests, Bahrain Grand Prix runs without a hitch
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:12 PM EDT, Sun April 22, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A British TV crew is detained and then released and deported, one of them says
Protests fail to halt the Bahrain Grand Prix, won by Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel
Activists say at least seven demonstrators are arrested inside the circuit
A government spokesman says women "tried to cause a scene (but) did not get very far"
(CNN) -- Days of escalating government protests failed to halt the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday, which took place even as nearby streets were blocked with burning tires and trash.
Opposition calls for large protests had raised fears the Grand Prix would have to be canceled for a second year in a row and pose a threat to Formula One crews, workers, and fans.
There were no major signs of protest at the race itself. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel secured the win, followed by Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean of Lotus-Renault.
Activists said police arrested a group of at least seven female protesters inside the circuit who held up a signs demanding the release of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a member of the opposition who has been on a hunger strike for more than two months. A government spokesman said he could not confirm those reports.
"It has been reported but not confirmed that two women have been detained out of 50,000 attendees," Bahraini government spokesman Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa said. "They tried to cause a scene at the end of the race, but they did not get very far."
Sunday's race was a "huge success," he said.
In addition, television reporter Jonathan Miller and members of his crew from Britain's Channel 4 were taken into custody, though there was no immediate explanation as to why. British Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote on Twitter, at what was then early Monday morning in Bahrain, that he was "very concerned about (the journalists) detention" and that embassy officials were "seeking urgent consular access."
A short time later, Miller sent a message himself on Twitter declaring he'd "been released with my crew. Breakneck drive to Bahrain airport in police van. Being deported now." The foreign affairs correspondent wrote that police "refused to give us back our cameras and computers," and that his driver and an activist accompanying them were still in custody.
"We are assured they will be freed soon," Miller said.
Anti-government protesters had called the race a publicity stunt by the country's rulers to make the nation appear more unified.
The Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled twice last year amid an uprising sparked by the success of popular revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Bahrain's Sunni-ruled government brutally crushed the Shiite uprising, though the opposition has continued to demand political reform in protests and, occasionally, clashes with authorities.
The February 14 Youth Coalition, an opposition group that took its name from the day the Bahrain uprising began last year, had urged protesters to turn out during the race Sunday.
"We ask the rebels in the western villages to escalate the revolutionary mobilization to the highest levels and to continue to target the street leading to the Bahrain circuit," the group said on its Facebook page.
Protests with burning tires and trash blocked most of the secondary roads leading to the race track, though the main highway remained open, said Mohammed al Maskati of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights.
There were also protests in many nearby villages, he said.
The government spokesman said there were "pockets of violence in remote parts of the country, but there has been no activity that has been seen anywhere around the circuit or on the way to the capital."
Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa had said another race cancellation would play into extremists' hands, according to the state-run Bahrain News Agency. And the sport's governing body vowed the event would go on, despite continuing high tensions.
On the eve of the race, security forces in a suburb of Manama clashed with thousands of protesters who were attempting to march to the highway that leads to the Formula One circuit. At least three people were injured during clashes, al Maskati said.
The demonstration was in response to the death of a protester whose body was found early Saturday on a farm outside Manama, a day after he took part in a demonstration that was broken up by security forces, according to opposition groups.
Bahrain's leading opposition party Al-Wefaq and the Bahrain Youth Society identified the man as Salah Abbas Habib Musa. The Bahrain Interior Ministry confirmed the identity of the 36-year-old man, and said the case is under investigation.
Formula One is the world's most popular motor sport, and races have a TV audience of more than 500 million. Canceling the race last year cost Bahrain an estimated $480 to $800 million in potential investments.
The Bahraini government has played down any risk to visitors, saying the Grand Prix will act as a unifying force amid the nation's civil unrest.
Bahrain has declined to extend the visas of non-sports reporting crews from CNN, Reuters and other news outlets and told them they would not be allowed to stay for the race.
Protesters, meanwhile, are using the international spotlight on the Grand Prix to call for the release of al-Khawaja, who was arrested about a year ago.
Al-Khawaja is protesting the life sentence he received for his role in anti-government demonstrations.
Denmark's ambassador met Sunday with al-Khawaja, who once lived in the country and holds Danish citizenship. The Danish government has asked that Bahrain turn him over; Bahraini officials have refused.
He was in stable condition Sunday, the Bahraini government spokesman said.
Al-Khawaja can appeal his life sentence during a hearing Monday, the government has said.
CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Salma Abdelaziz, Becky Anderson and Paul Gittings contributed to this report.

'Gang' shoots, kills international peacekeeper in Sudan's Darfur region
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 5:40 AM EDT, Mon August 13, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
African Union - United Nations peacekeepers are attacked in a Darfur refugee camp
A peacekeeper from Bangladesh dies and another peacekeeper is wounded, UNAMID says
A UNAMID official calls the attack "cowardly deplorable" and a war crime
Widespread violence has plagued the Darfur region, in southern Sudan, since 2003
(CNN) -- One international peacekeeper was shot dead and another was wounded early Sunday after a "gang" attacked their police post inside a refugee camp in Sudan's embattled Darfur region, the African Union - United Nations Mission said.
The incident came amid continued fighting, much of pitting armed militia groups against Sudanese government forces in the region, which is near Sudan's border with the new nation of South Sudan. Late last week, for instance, U.N. officials said all 25,000 people living in another Darfur refugee camp -- this one the Kassab camp, in north Darfur -- fled due to ongoing violence.
As to the latest incident, the joint mission, known as UNAMID, said in a statement Sunday that a "gang surrounded" its community policing center inside the Otash refugee camp in Nyala, South Darfur.

The armed men then began shooting, killing a peacekeeper from Bangladesh around 3:15 a.m. and wounding another, according to UNAMID. The infiltrators fled the scene after the A.U.-U.N. police unit returned fire, the mission said.
"The attack on our peacekeepers is cowardly (and) deplorable and our thoughts go to the families and friends of the fallen and the injured," said Aichatou Mindaoudou, acting joint special representative for the mission.
Mindaoudou urged Sudan's government to make a concerted bid to apprehend those responsible for the shooting, which she called a war crime under international law.
Violence has plagued Darfur for nearly a decade. The United Nations estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since the Darfur conflict broke out in 2003.
In March of this year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudan's defense minister for 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Darfur region. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is also wanted for crimes against humanity by the ICC in connection with the conflict.
Chris Cycmanick, head of media relations for UNAMID, told CNN late last week that there was a drop in civilian casualties between 2010 and 2011 in Darfur, "but recently there has been an uptick in criminal activity."
"The situation is troublesome, it is not supposed to be happening in Darfur, but there is still fighting going on," Cycmanick said.
A UNAMID statement issued last Monday said the latest round of violence began after an incident on August 1, when three armed men carjacked the local district commissioner and his driver and shot them dead.
"Subsequently, on the same day armed men surrounded Kassab, looted the market, burnt down the Sudanese Police post in the camp and reportedly killed four persons (three civilians and one police officer) and injured six others," the statement said.
Security continued to deteriorate over the following days in Kutum town, Kassab camp and another camp, Fataborno, "including fighting between the armed elements and government forces, as well as looting and displacement of civilians," it said.
Nyala, where the early Sunday morning attack occurred, is about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Kutum.
According to a paper published last month by the independent monitoring group Small Arms Survey, violence has picked up of late since new non-Arab "Popular Defense Forces" have been recruited, trained and armed by the Sudanese government since late 2010 to force Zaghawa rebel groups out of a swath of the eastern Darfur region.
As a result, about 70,000 people had been displaced by mid-2011, and retaliatory attacks by both sides continue, the group said in its paper. Meanwhile, aerial bombardment has been used to target rebel forces and civilian villages believed to support them, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
Weapons and ammunition also continue to flow into the hands of proxy forces and government forces in defiance of a "wholly ineffective" embargo on Darfur, the group reported.
CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen: Too often the warning signs of terrorism are missed
He says before an attack, it's difficult to sort out the signals from the noise
Agencies often will fail to widely communicate information in time to prevent attacks, he says
Bergen: Such failures became apparent after 9/11 attacks, Fort Hood shootings
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad" and a director at the New America Foundation.
(CNN) -- In her classic 1962 study, "Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision," Roberta Wohlstetter shows how the Japanese surprise attack on the U.S. naval base on December 7, 1941, should have been less surprising than it appeared at the time because there were warning signs known to the U.S. government that such an attack was possible.
Those warning signals, however, were not easy to understand before the Pearl Harbor attack and, in any case, they were not well communicated inside the U.S. military.
As Wohlstetter explains, "It is much easier after the event to sort the relevant signals from the irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has now occurred. But before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings. It comes to the observer embedded in an atmosphere of 'noise', i.e. in all sorts of information that is useless and irrelevant for predicting the disaster."
Peter Bergen
While the bombings at the Boston Marathon certainly were not anywhere on the scale of the Pearl Harbor attack, they share some of the commonalities that often characterize the run-up to such surprising attacks: Missed warning signals and the bureaucratic "stove piping" of important information that if it was more widely shared and understood might have led to the attacks being averted.
As is now well known, the Russian security agency FSB told the FBI in 2010 that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older alleged Boston bomber, was becoming radicalized. The FBI investigated him but found nothing "derogatory."
Yet, the FBI was unaware that a year after its investigation Tsarnaev returned from a trip to Dagestan and Chechnya in southern Russia--regions that are home to Islamist militants—after a six month trip, one that could have raised red flags, as by now he was on two federal watch lists.
(It's also not clear why the Russians would warn the FBI about Tsarnaev's radical interests and then, apparently, not have done more to keep tabs on him while he was on his lengthy trip to Russia.)
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection official on the FBI's Boston joint terrorism task force was made aware of Tsarnaev's return but because the FBI had closed its investigation into Tsarnaev, the information failed to arouse suspicion.
According to a report on CNN Tuesday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed concern that "the homeland security shop had information about the travel to Russia, the FBI did not, and they're not talking to each other and they're going back to the pre-9/11 problems here."
The CIA, FBI and bombing suspect #1
Keeping major events safe post-Boston
Did mother discuss jihad with son? Suspect's Miranda rights questioned
Indeed, these kind of bureaucratic snafus were supposed to have been resolved after 9/11.
That's because while the CIA provided plenty of strategic warnings in the spring and summer of 2001 that al Qaeda was planning a spectacular attack, the CIA also spectacularly dropped the ball in the run-up to 9/11 when it failed to "watch list" two suspected men that CIA officials suspected were members of al Qaeda, Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar.
The failure to add to the watch list two al Qaeda suspects with the Department of State meant that they entered the United States under their true names with ease.
On January 15, 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar flew into Los Angeles, but it was only in August 2001 as a result of questions raised by a CIA officer on assignment at the FBI that the two were added to the watch list and their names communicated to the FBI.
A month later Hamzi and Mihdhar were two of the "muscle" hijackers on the American Airlines jet that plunged into the Pentagon, killing 189 people.
There have been many fixes since 9/11 to ameliorate the problem of bureaucratic stove piping: far more communication, for instance, between the CIA and the FBI; the formation of dozens of Joint Terrorism Task Forces across the country that help to facilitate the sharing of information among multiple law enforcement agencies, as well as the creation of the National Counterterrorism Center, which coordinates terrorism policy across the intelligence and law enforcement communities.
But even with all of these reforms the counterterrorism system continues to miss the kind of warning signs that take on great significance in the wake of an attack.
Consider the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan, a military psychiatrist who killed 13 people at Ft. Hood, Texas, in 2009. Before this attack, intelligence agencies had intercepted multiple e-mails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric then based in Yemen who was well known for his virulent anti-American preaching and ties to militants. Counterterrorism investigators didn't pursue this worrisome connection believing that the e-mails were consistent with Hasan's work as a military psychiatrist.
Similarly, Carlos Bledsoe, a convert to Islam who shot up a Little Rock, Arkansas, recruiting office in 2009, fatally shooting a soldier, had recently travelled to Yemen and was under investigation by the FBI following his return to the United States.
Despite the fact that the FBI had had him under surveillance, Bledsoe was still able to acquire guns for his attack. When he was arrested, police found a rifle with a laser sight, a revolver, ammunition and material to make Molotov cocktails in his vehicle.
Plenty of warning signs also preceded Nigerian Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab's attempt to blow up Northwest flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 with an underwear bomb made with PETN, a plastic explosive that was not detected by airport security. Luckily the bomb failed to detonate, although it set Abdulmutallab's clothes on fire. Abdulmutallab had been recruited by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) for the Detroit mission.
The Northwest Airlines plot had been presaged a few months earlier. On August 28, 2009, the Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammed bin Nayef survived a bombing attack launched by AQAP. The would-be assassin concealed the bomb in his underwear, which was made of PETN.
Three months before the Christmas Day attempted bombing John Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, had been personally briefed by Prince Nayef about the assassination attempt, so information about the possible use of a hard-to-detect PETN bomb was known within the U.S. national security establishment.
The White House's review of the Christmas Day plot also found that there was sufficient information known to the U.S. government to determine that Abdulmutallab was likely working for al Qaeda and that the group was looking to expand its attacks beyond Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
Yet the intelligence community "did not increase analytic resources working" on the threat that the group might pose to the West.
Additionally, a few weeks before the botched attack on the Northwest flight, Abdulmutallab's father contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria about concerns his son had "become radicalized" and might be planning something, but this information wasn't further investigated.
As the inevitable congressional inquiries get under way that will focus on who knew what and when about the Boston bombers, we will surely deepen our understanding that there were plenty of warning signs about the increasing radicalization of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, some of which were likely known to the U.S. government.
The problem is that, as Roberta Wohlstetter pointed out half a century ago in her study of Pearl Harbor, separating out the really important signals from all the "noise" in the system is only easy to do after the fact, particularly when the U.S. government has now assembled a database of an astonishing number of 700,000 individuals it suspects of ties to terrorism.

Borussia Dortmund thrash second-from-bottom Freiburg to stay top of league
Bayern Munich beat Wolfsburg to stay second on goal difference Bayer Leverkusen consolidate third place with 2-0 win over Hannover (CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund recorded an emphatic 5-0 win over second-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday to improve an already healthy goal difference and stay top of the Bundesliga.
Jurgen Klopp's side lost their 100% record last weekend when they drew 1-1 with Nuremburg, but bounced back brilliantly against 10-man Freiburg at the Signal Iduna Park.
The rout got underway in the 35th minute when Marcus Reus tapped in after Robert Lewandowski's shot had been palmed away by goalkeeper Oliver Baumann.

The lead was doubled ten minutes later after defender Fallou Diagne was shown a straight red card for pulling down Lewandowski inside the penalty area. Reus stepped up to convert the resulting spot kick.
Lewandowski got in on the act in the 58th minute to make it 3-0 before adding a fourth goal 12 minutes later. Jakub Błaszczykowski's goal 11 minutes from time ensured Dortmund boosted their goal difference to plus 16 -- four ahead of their Bavarian rivals.
Bayern, who put four goals past Schalke last weekend, had to settle for a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.
Pep Guardiola's men created chances galore but only one was converted -- Thomas Muller directing Franck Ribery's low cross goalwards in the 62nd minute.
Bayern travel to Manchester City on Wednesday for the second round of Champions League group matches. Dortmund host the French side Marseille -- a team they lost to twice in the group stages two seasons ago -- on Tuesday.
Bayer Leverkusen kept pace with the leaders with a 2-0 win over fourth-place Hannover. First-half goals from Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam earned the home side a sixth win in seven matches to consolidate third place, one point behind both Dortmund and Bayern.
Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin move up to fifth with a 3-1 over mid-table Mainz, while the game between Hoffenheim and Schalke ended in a 3-3 draw.

Michael Schumacher: Family ask media for privacy
updated 7:22 AM EST, Tue January 7, 2014
Michael Schumacher navigates a slalom course at the Italian ski resort of Madonna di Campiglio in 2005. The seven-time Formula One world champion remains in a critical condition following a skiing accident in the French Alps on Sunday. The 44-year-old was reportedly wearing a helmet. Ski safety specialist Dr. Mike Langran says a helmet can never provide complete protection in all accident situations, but its use "will have substantially attenuated the injuries sustained." Schumacher skiing in Madonna di Campiglio in January 2008. "Accidents of this nature are, thankfully, rare events amongst skiers and snowboarders," Langran says. "The absolute risk of an injury whilst skiing or snowboarding recreationally remains very low, in the order of 2-4 injuries per 1,000 days spent on the slopes. The vast majority of people will ski or board all their lives without ever sustaining a significant injury." Schumacher skiing in Madonna di Campiglio in January 2008. "My colleagues and I in the snow sports medicine fraternity continue to recommend that all skiers and snowboarders wear an appropriately sized and designed helmet on the slopes," Langran said in a statement on website www.ski-injury.com on Monday.
The "Dent de Burgin" peak in the French ski resort of Meribel under which the retired German driver reportedly had his skiing accident. Schumacher was airlifted to hospital in Grenoble. "Medical care both on the slopes and in hospital in France is amongst the finest in the world and Michael will no doubt be receiving the very best care in Grenoble," Langran said.
Schumacher skiing at the Madonna di Campiglio resort in 2005. Langran said fatalities in the sport are relatively low: "The rate of fatality converts to 0.78 per million skier/snowboarder visits. Although it's not directly comparable, in the United States in 2009, 2,400 people drowned while swimming in public areas and 800 died while bicycle riding." Schumacher (center) on a ski lift at the Madonna di Campiglio resort in January 2006. Langran says that over the past decade about 41.5 people have died skiing/snowboarding per year in the U.S. on average. "During the 2010/11 season, 47 fatalities occurred out of the 60.5 million skier/snowboarder days reported for the season," he added. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Michael Schumacher's wife asks for privacy as the Formula One racer remains in a critical condition
She also asks for the media to leave the French hospital where he is being treated
Doctors say Schumacher's condition is stable but that he is being constantly monitored
The racing driver hit his head on a rock while skiing at the end of December
(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher's family has asked for privacy as the Formula One star remains in a critical condition in a French hospital following a skiing accident.
The 45-year-old is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury.
Schumacher is a formidable figure in F1, winning a record seven world titles, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans.
However his family wants the media to keep their distance.
"Please support us in our common fight with Michael," Corinna Schumacher, wife of the F1 racer, said in a statement.
"It is important to me that you [media] relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace.
"I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace."

Retracing Schumacher's off-piste route
Manager: Schumacher in stable condition
Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December.
The German hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. He was not moving fast at the time.
He is in a medically induced coma and has undergone two operations.
His condition has attracted intense media scrutiny and last week a journalist disguised as a priest tried to sneak into the French hospital room where the Formula One superstar is being treated.
The doctors at the hospital have also called for the media to provide more respect.
"The privacy of the patient demands that we are not going into details of his treatment, and this is why we do not plan any press conferences, nor give out written press releases, anymore for the time being," they said in a statement on Monday
"We again insistently ask you to respect the medical secrets and to stick to the information given by the medical team in charge of the patient or his management, as this is the only valid information.
"The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is constantly monitored by the medical treatments that are administered to him.
"However, the medical team responsible underlines that they will not stop to consider Michael's condition as critical."
Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm added: "I can confirm Michael's condition can be considered as stable, as written in the official statement. I cannot confirm to have stated that his life is out of danger."
French prosecutors will reportedly brief journalists on their investigation into Schumacher's accident on Wednesday in the Alpine town of Albertville.
Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, driving for the Benetton and Ferrari teams and winning a record seven world titles and 91 grand prix wins.

Saudi man loses more than 700 pounds after King intervenes
By Schams Elwazer, CNN
updated 4:06 PM EST, Mon February 3, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
In August, King Abdullah ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari to be treated in Riyadh, the capital
He then weighed 1,345 pounds and had not left his bed for three years, magazine says
Heart and lungs are better, and he has less inflammation and stronger muscles, doctor says
Shaari still can't move on his own and uses a mechanized pulley to sit on a big wheelchair
(CNN) -- A Saudi man has lost more than 700 pounds (320 kilograms) -- more than half his body weight -- since Saudi Arabia's King ordered him hospitalized in August, according to a Saudi magazine that interviewed him at a hospital.
In August, King Abdullah ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari, who then weighed 1,345 pounds (610 kilograms), to undergo treatment in the capital, Riyadh. Shaari, estimated to be in his late teens, was unable to move by himself and was transferred from Jazan in southern Saudi Arabia.
Dr. Aa'ed al-Qahtani, head of the medical team overseeing Shaari's treatment, told Sayidaty magazine in a recent interview that Shaari's health is continuing to improve at a steady rate. He has improved heart and lung function, reduced inflammation and improved muscle strength, including the ability to move his feet, he said.
A massive custom-made wheelchair was built to help Shaari become more mobile and aid his physical therapy, al-Qahtani said. Shaari still cannot move on his own and needs to use a mechanized pulley to sit on the chair. Before being taken out of his house on a forklift, Shaari had not left his bed for three years, the magazine said.
In photos published in the magazine, which has launched an obesity awareness campaign, Shaari is shown smiling and holding up a victory sign. Doctors say his spirits have constantly remained high. Dr. Abdeljabbar al-Yamani, the managing director of King Fahd Medical City, has dubbed him "the smiling man."
His mother has stayed with him since he was admitted.
