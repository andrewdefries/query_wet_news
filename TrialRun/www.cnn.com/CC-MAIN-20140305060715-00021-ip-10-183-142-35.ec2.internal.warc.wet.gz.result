Living paycheck to paycheck From Brent Rassmussen CareerBuilder.com Editor Adjust font size:
(CareerBuilder.com) -- Counting down the minutes to payday? You're not alone. Four-in-ten workers (41 percent) say they often or always live paycheck to paycheck, according to CareerBuilder.com's latest survey.At the end of 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported the average weekly earnings of a full-time worker was $682. Take out taxes and other deductions like Social Security and Medicare, and that take-home pay is even less. Now subtract money spent on food, clothing, rent or mortgage, utilities, transportation, healthcare, education and other services for day-to-day living and there's often not a lot left over.Scrambling to make ends meet is an exercise all too familiar in many homes. One-third of workers report they don't have enough income to live comfortably. To achieve this, more than half said they would need to earn more than $500 per paycheck. Thirty-seven percent of workers said they have one income for their households while 16 percent say they work more than one job just to make ends meet.Because workers' paychecks are often spent before they even hit the bank, saving is often not an option. One-in-five said they don't set aside any money for savings each month. Twenty-eight percent save $100 or less per month and 16 percent save less than $50. And those golden years might not be so golden: 25 percent don't participate in a 401(k), IRA or other retirement plan.So if you had the extra money, what would you do with it? Turns out many of you'd like be saving for a rainy day... or the future. In a 2006, American Payroll Association asked 33,128 Americans the question what they would do if they received a 100 percent pay raise. A combined 51 percent said they would either deposit it into savings, contribute it to a 401(k) or invest it.While a bigger paycheck may help, planning ahead and maximizing benefits offered by employers can also play a major role in stretching your dollar. Here are some ways to help create a healthy bottom line at home:Use direct deposit.Many employers offer this to employees. By having your paycheck deposited directly into your bank account, you resist the temptation of just cashing it or getting cash back.Pay yourself first.Even if it's only $10 a week, set aside a certain amount of money every payday in a separate savings account. Don't touch it. Over time, you'll see it add up from your regular contributions and earned interest.Don't leave any money on the table.Take advantage of your employer's cost-saving benefits including flex-spending, education reimbursement and wellness benefits. Flexible spending accounts enable workers to designate a certain amount of pre-tax dollars for health-related expenses. Consider your commute, too. Some employers will reimburse transportation expenses or provide flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting.Track your spending.Although 58 percent of workers have a set budget each pay period, 21 percent say they typically spend over their allotted amount. When asked what puts them over budget most often, the most popular response was eating out.Skip the ATM.If you have cash on you, you'll spend it. Minimize your trips to the ATM by giving yourself a weekly cash allowance and using only that for the week. This might mean cutting back on daily lattes and lunches out, but you won't miss it over time.Evaluate your paycheck.Eighty-one percent of employers surveyed plan to increase salaries for existing employees in 2007 and nearly half expect to increase salaries on initial offers to new employees. Negotiations may be in order.Start a job search.Some job search expenses such as agency fees, travel expenses, long-distance calls and copying and mailing r�sum�s are tax deductible for qualifying workers.Brent Rassmussen is COO of CareerBuilder.com.

Secret Service countersnipers hunt for real snipersStory Highlights Countersniper teams to be out in force across Washington for Inauguration Day "They will be familiar with every potential threat," director says The Secret Service formed the elite unit in 1971 Homeland security chief says agency is prepared Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO By Jeanne Meserve and Mike M. Ahlers CNN WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Look up at any presidential event and you're likely to see them: men dressed in black, armed to the teeth, looking back. Countersniper teams "will be familiar with every potential threat," according to the Secret Service. It's no secret; they're with the Secret Service. On Tuesday at the inauguration, members of the U.S. Secret Service's elite countersniper unit will be out in force, taking roof-top positions along Pennsylvania Avenue and elsewhere as the presidential motorcade glides past throngs of people for the swearing in of Barack Obama. The Secret Service doesn't mind you knowing they are up there. In fact, their mere presence at the inauguration has a deterrent effect, they say. But they are mum about many other details, including how many teams will be deployed, how long they work and about their custom firearms. Watch countersniper detail up-close » Unit commander Lt. Bernard Hall jokingly calls the weapon a JAR -- "Just Another Rifle." Since the unit formed in 1971, the unit has never had to fire a JAR to safeguard a person they are assigned to protect. "When you look at that parade on the day of the inauguration, every building that we will pass by ... has been surveyed, and that is done by the Countersniper Team," said Secret Service director Mark Sullivan. "They will be familiar with every building; they will be familiar with every potential threat." But the absence of gunfire -- a welcome absence in this line of work -- doesn't mean they have never identified or mitigated a threat, Sullivan says. The teams typically consist of two people, both armed with high-powered rifles, either of whom can shoot to deter an imminent threat. If one countersniper spots a threat, that person prepares to shoot while the other member takes on the role of "wind caller," telling the shooter how to adjust his aim to counteract the wind. The wind caller takes cues from chimney smoke, flags or undulations from the atmosphere. Don't Miss Chertoff: Inauguration security forces 'ready'

CNN's Jeanne Meserve reports on how the counter snipers of the U.S. Secret Service are gearing up for Inauguration Day.

At a firing range outside of Washington, the team demonstrates its skills in a variety of positions. Both men peer through high-powered binoculars looking for threats. "Watch the threat area," an instructor shouts. Thirty seconds pass before a target pops up down range. One of the countersnipers drops his binoculars and reaches for his weapon, shouting to his colleague. "Left side. Left side," the wind reader responds. The shooter fires one shot. "Center! In the middle," the instructor reports. While the countersnipers can scan the crowds below, their focus is on looking for places where snipers might be concealed, team members say. All countersnipers go through nine weeks of intense training. Half of those who try out for the team fail. Fewer than 200 people have been assigned to the unit in its 30-plus year history, the service says. There are fewer than 100 countersnipers in the unit, a Secret Service spokesman says. This isn't a job for someone who can't handle extreme temperatures. The cold can be biting; the heat, blistering. Hall said officers have tricks for keeping mental focus in inclement weather. "When it's hot, we're probably thinking about the cold days in January. When it's cold, we're probably thinking about August," he said. On Tuesday, in addition to the snipers, an estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty, along with almost 1,000 FBI personnel, Transportation Security Administration screeners and others, including 10,000 National Guard troops. The Department of Homeland Security has said that another 20,000 members of the National Guard are being held in reserve. "I think we are ready," said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. "I don't anticipate anything disruptive. Part of my job is to hope for the best and plan for the worst."

An act of faith, desperation or protest: Self-immolations through time By Jessica Ravitz, CNN Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, burns himself to death at an intersection in Saigon on June 11, 1963. STORY HIGHLIGHTSSelf-immolations are in the news, after Tunisian's act spawns others in AfricaIn the Chinese Buddhist tradition, the practice dates back more than 1,500 yearsWesterners woke up to it in the 1960s, after monk ignited self on Saigon streetPeople across globe have since self-immolated, but not always to the same effect (CNN) -- Night had fallen when the men heard the sounds on the mountain. First it was a chime, then a recitation of verses, followed by the crackle of wood burning. They scrambled to the summit to see what was happening. There, seated with his palms together and facing west, was their friend. Flames leapt around the peaceful man, engulfing him. It was just as he'd intended. The year was 527. This story of Daodu, a Buddhist monk, is told in James Benn's "Burning for the Buddha: Self-Immolation in Chinese Buddhism." Benn, an associate professor of religion at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, writes that the act of setting one's self on fire dates back in Chinese Buddhist tradition to the late fourth century. But no matter how old, self-immolation still leaves people horrified, riveted and moved. The popular uprising that led to the toppling of Tunisia's government began after Mohamed Bouazizi, an unemployed 26-year-old college graduate, ignited himself in protest and died earlier this month. Since then, a wave of self-immolations has rolled through North Africa, with other incidents in Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania. "There's something so primal, so dramatic. ... It's meant to be noticed," said Carolyn Marvin, a professor who's specialized in freedom of expression at the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. It seems to "demand some kind of reparation." Though the history of self-immolation may run more than 1,500 years deep, the Western world woke up to it in the 1960s. The iconic June 1963 image of Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, surrounded by flames in a busy Saigon intersection was seared into Western consciousness. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government, and his actions are often seen as having helped spark the regime's overthrow later that year. Others followed his example, not just in Vietnam but in the United States, too. In March 1965, an 82-year-old woman, Alice Herz, protested the ongoing Vietnam War by setting herself on fire on a Detroit, Michigan, street corner. Norman Morrison, 31, ignited himself eight months later outside the Pentagon, beneath the office window of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. The following week, Roger Allen LaPorte, 22, did the same in front of New York City's United Nations building. In other countries, too, self-immolations have played a part in political and social movements. There was Jan Palach, a 20-year-old student who in 1969 very publicly set himself on fire in Prague, Czechoslovakia, protesting Czech apathy five months after the Soviet occupation. Homa Darabi, a 54-year-old woman, did it in Iran in 1994 to demonstrate for women's rights after the Islamic Revolution. And a group of five burned together in 2001 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, though three survived and the motivations are a matter of debate.

Why Tunisia matters to Americans
People have reportedly self-immolated in response to Communist regimes in Romania and Hungary, taxes in Sweden, the kidnapping of children by Chilean police. It's been done in Italy to protest the Catholic church's condemnation of homosexuality, in India to protest a film screening, and in the United Kingdom after an asylum claim was rejected. The list of locations, and reasons, goes on. But beyond political or social motivations, can faith inspire someone to burn themselves alive -- as it apparently did for Daodu in 527? Of the well-known U.S. cases, which represent a diversity of backgrounds, it's next to impossible to say. Herz, the 82-year-old Vietnam protester, was an immigrant of Jewish descent and had reportedly spent time in an internment camp during World War II. Morrison, who died outside the Pentagon, was a Quaker. LaPorte, who protested in flames in front of the United Nations, was a former seminary student and a member of the Catholic Worker Movement In other cases, self-immolation has been more clearly linked to religious belief. Though outlawed in India for nearly two centuries, some Hindu communities practiced the ritual of sati -- in which a widowed Hindu woman would throw herself, or be thrown, on her husband's funeral pyre. In Buddhism, the subject of self-immolation is controversial, said Robert Sharf, the chair of the Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. "Many (Buddhist) schools strongly condemn suicide," he said, "but at the same time, in East Asia, self-immolation has been practiced on and off for well over a thousand years." Like most religions, he said, the canonical literature is so vast that, if you dig deep enough, you can find teachings to fit your needs. Enter the Lotus Sutra, considered one of the most significant Buddhist scriptures in East Asia. There's a small passage in one chapter that speaks of a Medicine King, one with great spiritual and moral wisdom. "The Sutra tells us that as an offering to the Buddha and to display his insight that the body is not a permanent, unchanging self, he poured fragrant oil on himself and allowed himself to be burned by fire," wrote Buddhist monk, author, teacher and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh is his book, "Peaceful Action, Open Heart." "This is a quite radical demonstration of his freedom and insight, one that was made out of a very deep love," he wrote. And it was this part of the Lotus Sutra that Vietnamese monks and nuns pointed to when it came to self-immolation in the 1960s. But people don't burn themselves to death "simply because the Lotus Sutra says to do it," emphasized UC Berkeley's Sharf. "While it is an extreme and contentious practice, some Buddhists regard it as the ultimate form of self-sacrifice, justified in times of social crisis to bring about political transformation." As for the recent self-immolations in North Africa, As'ad AbuKhalil said they are about sought-after change, not about religion. "Western media still highly exaggerate the role and influence of Islam in political behavior and actions (and even violence by) Arabs and Muslims," said AbuKhalil, a political science professor at California State University, Stanislaus, and a blogger for a site called The Angry Arab News Service. "The Tunisian uprising is clearly a secular event, and the Islamists have no role whatsoever in it. Not all actions by Arabs are derived by Islamic notions and principles." He said there's "no basis in Islam for self-immolations" and that the practice came from "Asian non-Muslim societies." What's happening now "reveals not an attempt to express oneself Islamically, so to speak, but to express oneself in an act that draws attention and sympathy and shows the outrage experienced by the oppressed Arab population." Marvin, the Penn communications professor, echoed his sentiments. "These young men represent a fairly dispossessed class," she said. "It's as if they're offering up all that they have, their bodies, on behalf of the needs of their group." Though the intentions of those who ignite themselves cannot always be known, some trends can be surmised -- especially when those who act don't succeed in dying. A 22-year-old woman, severely burned from self-immolation, sits on her hospital bed in Herat, Afghanistan, in 2004. RELATED TOPICS

CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson wrote in late November about a surge in female self-immolation cases in Herat, Afghanistan. "They had set fire to themselves, so oppressed and desperate were they to escape abusive bad marriages," he wrote. The number of cases "had doubled in the past year," a doctor told him. Some stories of self-immolations have become iconic. They, like the case of Bouazizi, seemed to galvanize others and force change. But not all do. In the United States, decades past Vietnam, at least two additional cases are thought to have been, at least in part, politically motivated, although the mental states of those who acted have been questioned. Malachi Ritscher, 52, lit himself on fire near a downtown Chicago, Illinois, expressway in 2006. The musician and activist was said to be protesting the war in Iraq, but he was also reportedly a recovering alcoholic who battled depression. Ten years before Ritscher set himself ablaze, a middle-aged woman did the same on Penn's campus in front of an outdoor sculpture of the peace symbol, Marvin said. She was Kathy Change. "She was a very tall, willowy woman who would dance," across the campus," Marvin said. "She left a suicide note. And the saddest part of it was she had this idea that if she burned herself it would stop everyone in their tracks, and everyone would be good to each other." Paul Root Wolpe, the director of Emory University's Center of Ethics in Atlanta, Georgia, was a sociology professor at Penn at that time. In a letter he wrote to the student paper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, Wolpe -- who would later be asked to speak at Change's memorial service -- challenged students to not simply write her off as "deranged." "She was the 'Dancing Lady' who often floated through campus waving a banner, spouting some vague references to love and political change. She was one of those characters who bring color to a college campus -- hard to ignore, but easy to dismiss -- and her final protest had the same character," he wrote. "Let us, for a moment, give her the respect of taking her act seriously. What is it you would sacrifice your time and effort -- if not your life -- for?"

Bahrain doctors go on trial, alleging torture to extract confessions From Nic Robertson, CNN A shot from February shows doctors and nurses holding a banner while marching from the Salmaniya Medical Complex, now at the center of court proceedings in Bahrain. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: The doctors appear stressed and anxious in courtNEW: The judge denies a request to free the defendants during the trialDozens of doctors and nurses are accused of taking control of a hospital and holding prisonersThe judge agrees to have civilian doctors examine the defendants Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Dozens of doctors and nurses went on trial Monday in Bahrain, accused of taking control of a hospital during anti-government protests, storing weapons and keeping people prisoner. The doctors, their lawyers and international human rights activists say the defendants were tortured to extract confessions against a background of demonstrations in the kingdom. Eleven male doctors appeared in court Monday, their heads shaven, alongside at least five female doctors. They appeared stressed and anxious. One of the doctors tried to tell the judge that his confession had been extracted under torture, but the judge told him to stop and that he would be able to give evidence later in the trial. About half the courtroom was packed with family members. Human rights observers were in the court. Doctors and nurses on trial in Bahrain
Defense lawyers asked for civilian doctors to examine their clients, who have only been seen by military medical staff to date. The judge agreed, and adjourned until next week after a brief hearing. The judge denied a request from some defense lawyers that the doctors be released while the trial is ongoing. Many of the defendants -- 24 doctors and 23 nurses and paramedics -- worked at Salmaniya Medical Complex, which the government says served as a coordination point for protests against the government earlier this year. Prosecutors alleged Monday that automatic weapons and ammunition were discovered in the hospital, that the defendants "hijacked" the hospital building and controlled it, that they protested and used violence in a government building (the hospital), and that they kidnapped the people in the hospital and kept them prisoner inside. Government official Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak al-Khalifa raised the country's sectarian divide, accusing the doctors of refusing to treat Sunnis and ethnic Indians. Most Bahrains are Shiite, but the ruling elite are Sunni. "We expect doctors to observe their oath and treat all people, regardless of sect, equally," al-Khalifa said in comments to CNN the day before the hearing. Activists and human rights groups allege that the medical workers are being prosecuted for treating protesters. We found doctors were simply providing ethical and life-saving medical care to patients whom Bahraini security forces had shot, detained and tortured--Richard Sollom, Physicians for Human Rights

Protests and Demonstrations
Protests swept the strategically important island kingdom this year as populations across the Arab world rose up against their rulers. The small, predominantly Shiite country, governed by a Sunni royal family, is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. About 30 people have died during protests, according to figures from the government, opposition figures and human rights groups. Opposition and human rights groups say the government has detained more than 1,000 people. During the protests, security forces stormed the Salmaniya Complex, the main hospital in the capital Manama, and beat doctors and demonstrators, according to witnesses. The hospital "was used as a coordination center by protesters and had been overrun by political and sectarian activity, severely interrupting services and endangering lives," said Houda Noono, Bahrain's ambassador to the United States. "During this period, patients were refused treatment on the basis of their sect or ethnicity, and emergency calls were neglected," she said. "The hospital grounds were barricaded and Salmaniya was very clearly no longer a neutral, medical establishment. As a result, the action to secure the hospital was both unavoidable and necessary." Human rights groups have accused the government of widespread attacks on doctors and other medical workers. "We documented a systematic attack on medical staff in Bahrain including the beatings, torture and disappearances of more than 30 physicians," said Richard Sollom, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights. "We found doctors were simply providing ethical and life-saving medical care to patients whom Bahraini security forces had shot, detained and tortured," Sollom said. Physicians for Human Rights, a group that shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to ban landmines, says it sent investigators to the Persian Gulf kingdom and interviewed 45 patients, doctors, nurses and witnesses. The report details attacks on "physicians, medical staff, patients and unarmed civilians with the use of bird shot, physical beatings, rubber bullets, tear gas and unidentified chemical agents," the group said in an April report. Its report echoes those released earlier by Human Rights Watch and Doctors Without Borders. Bahraini officials have denied the allegations. CNN's Jenifer Fenton contributed to this report.

Dubai staging a comeback amid economic gloom
By Arvid Ahlund, CNN
updated 6:57 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Four years ago Dubai was at the height of an unparalleled economic boom that then turned to bust
Most recently, it outlined plans to build a brand new city
Analysts say the Arab Spring has made Dubai a safe haven for those who worry about the turmoil elsewhere
The hope is that projects like Mohammed bin Rashid will lure millions more visitors a year
(CNN) -- Four decades ago it was merely barren desert land. Four years ago it was at the height of an unparalleled economic boom that turned to bust amid the global financial crisis. Today the emirate of Dubai is staging a lively comeback, once again announcing the kind of ambitious plans that made it famous in the first place.
Most recently, it outlined plans to build a brand new city. Named after its ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid, it is intended to house a hundred hotels and a Universal Studios entertainment center. It is the latest in a string of glitzy projects, among them the world's tallest building, the world's largest shopping mall -- even man-made islands and in-door ski resorts.
In 2009, cheap credit had spurred a considerable real estate bubble in the Gulf state, which once it burst, caused property prices to tumble and debt to spiral out of control.
The lifeline came from the neighbor Abu Dhabi, which extended a multi-billion dollar bailout loan. Dubai was forced to get its house in order.
Dubai wrestles with economic recovery
Today, the emirate has gone back to its core strength, Philippe Dauba-Pantanacce, senior economist at Standard Chartered, tells CNN. One of the biggest growth drivers, he says, is the airport activity.
"It's estimated that by the end of this year, 56 million people will have gone through Dubai airports. That makes it one of the three to four biggest airports in the world."
But travelers are no longer just passing through. Analysts say the Arab Spring has made Dubai a safe haven for people in the Middle East who worry about the turmoil elsewhere.
"Tourists from other Gulf states have increased by 45% in 2012. This has pushed up hotel occupancy to nearly 90% -- a world record," Dauba-Pantanacce says.
That has lifted confidence.
"The trajectory is positive at the moment," says Stuart Anderson, managing director at Standard & Poor's, adding that Dubai has benefited from rising oil prices.
Yet, for a state that was once riddled with debt, some say financing remains a concern.
"Though Dubai has been able to make good on all its obligations in 2012, the Dubai story cannot be completely separated from the debt overhang which is still there," Dauba-Pantanacce says.
The hope is that projects like Mohammed bin Rashid will lure millions more visitors a year. And though similar projects were shelved only a few years ago, the citizens of Dubai avow that the hard lessons have been learned.

SXSW may have peaked, and that's not a bad thing
By Omar L. Gallaga, Special to CNN
updated 2:38 PM EST, Thu March 7, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Observers say hype around South by Southwest Interactive is more muted this year
Some SXSW veterans feel the festival may have reached a saturation point
SXSW is seen as a place to preview trends that may become mainstream in a few years Just days before the festival, no big blow-out events have been announced
Editor's note: CNN Tech will be covering all the happenings from SXSW. Follow our updates on Twitter at @cnntech.
Austin, Texas (CNN) -- In South by Southwest Interactive, the tech-geek festival that begins here Friday, some see a five-day spring break of sorts: a chance to discover some buzzy new apps, catch a few panels and party alongside Web celebrities, futurists and many, many bloggers.
But others see the festival as a microcosm of the larger tech-culture community, a place to preview things that may become mainstream in a few years and where trends that play out in downtown Austin are indicators of what's to come.
Which is why we wonder each year: Has the festival peaked? Will the irrationally app-exuberant bubble finally burst?
If SXSW Interactive doesn't keep growing at up to 40% every year, does that mean the tech industry is slowing down or that the festival itself has reached capacity? Or is it only the hype that has plateaued?
This year, some SXSW veterans feel the maturing festival, which began in the late 1990s, may have reached a saturation point, especially when it comes to startups trying to draw attention to new products. SXSW Interactive famously helped Twitter get off the ground in 2007 and gave apps such as Foursquare and Highlight a boost in recent years.
But as SXSW has gotten crowded, it's become much harder to stand out.
The SXSW Interactive festival in Austin, Texas, is a meeting of Web minds, but partying also plays a major role.
"I feel like people are having to put more effort because there's so much noise and so much going on," said Jennifer Sinski, an entrepreneur who runs RSVPster, which will auto-RSVP attendees to unofficial parties and events for a fee.
This year, Sinski said, "There's really no big app expected to launch, nothing huge people are excited for on the tech side."
That thought was echoed by a recent TechCrunch article wondering whether the era of big SXSW app launches may have passed.
Just days before the festival starts, there have also been no big blow-out events announced to rival 2012's American Express concert featuring Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen's powerhouse gig or the party for the app Mobli that drew investors Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire to town.
American Express will still be at the festival, but it will likely keep a lower profile given it announced 5,400 job cuts in January. Microsoft is no longer a sponsor at Interactive this year, and the annual TechKaraoke event will be missing.
That being said, rumors that Justin Timberlake will perform continue to swirl and notables such as former Vice President Al Gore, entrepreneur Elon Musk, broadcaster Rachel Maddow and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal are part of the official programming. And this year's themes of private space travel, 3-D printing, hacker culture and crowdfunding, still feel forward-looking.
Hugh Forrest, the longtime director of SXSW Interactive, says a slowing of growth may actually benefit the festival, which in recent years has put a strain on Austin's infrastructure. Forrest says that based on registration so far, the Interactive part of the festival is expected to grow at a more modest rate of 5% to 8% this year.
"It's definitely not the sharper increases we've had in the last few years," Forrest said. "In many ways, that's a good thing. It gives us the bandwidth to work out some of the rough edges."
Some of the growing pains, especially in the festival's Startup Village and Accelerator (a kind of "American Idol" competition for startups), prompted the festival to expand its reach beyond Austin. In August, it will launch V2V in Las Vegas, a new SXSW Interactive conference focused on tech entrepreneurship.
It's one way SXSW is hoping to alleviate the hotel crunch and downtown congestion that happens here every March.
Stephanie Wonderlin, a senior manager and social strategist with Momentum Factor, will be attending Interactive for her third year. Last year, she hosted videos for Chevy, which was pushing its Volt vehicles to techies at the fest.
Wonderlin believes things have been quieter going into Interactive this year, at least from her perspective. "I keep asking myself, 'What do I feel is missing?' I don't know if it's me being snooty."
For 2013, she says her schedule has shifted from big parties to smaller gatherings and networking, a trend she's seeing among friends, some of whom aren't bothering to pay for a badge.
"I think the size and how big it's gotten were just so overblown that maybe people who have to be there now want to do things on their own. One person told me, 'I would rather grab a bottle of wine and head up to a rooftop with a small group of friends' than go to the big parties," Wonderlin said.
"A lot of people I know who are big company sponsors say they're not even going to any of the sessions. I think the purpose of SXSW has changed."
Sinski, who's been going to SXSW Music for eight years and became more interested in Interactive as she launched her company, says that people who use her service are less interested in hype and big stars than they are in free food, real networking and companies that have something unique to show.
"Spending a lot of money isn't as big a deal as it was two or three years ago," she said. "Now it's about what you can offer people."

Apple splits its pitch: Can it work? By Stuart Miles, Special to CNN updated 8:58 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Apple has launched two new iPhones, one for early adopters and one for budget crowd Tech journalist Stuart Miles says Apple is staying within its remit of keeping things simple
Most importantly, the company is expanding in new markets like China and Japan
Editor's note: Technology journalist Stuart Miles is CEO and founder of gadget review website Pocket-lint. He can be found tweeting at @stuartmiles.
(CNN) -- For the first time, Apple has launched not one, but two iPhones at its now-annual iPhone launch event.
As the rumors predicted, Apple has split its phone line into a premium all singing, all dancing flagship phone for the early tech adopters and one that will play to the so-called "budget" crowd looking for an iPhone with a more colourful, youthful approach.
The expected result? A successful one. The iPhone 5C gives Apple an affordable phone for those that it has yet to lure into buying an iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. At the same time it has helped create a greater gulf between the two devices that was never really there with the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5.
Will people buy new iPhones? Now, early tech adopters who opt for the iPhone 5S -- compared to their parents or kids that will more than likely opt for the iPhone 5C -- can claim a faster, more powerful phone. It has greater connectivity, an abundance of sensors, including the new addition of fingerprint scanner called TouchID, and more premium materials.

Check out Apple's new iPhone 5C
It's a clever move from Apple as it protects its justification for higher prices. It has, at the same time, created a phone for "the people," that in reality is just as powerful as the previous flagship, the iPhone 5, at a knocked-down price.
iPhone 5S to come in gold, gray, silver
Not that the competition will be saying that. SIM-free, the new iPhone 5C is still expensive compared to the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4.
iPhone 5S has fingerprint technology
It might be budget, but Apple believes even this "cheaper" phone is the best on the market. Even though it comes with an "unashamedly plastic shell," in the words of Jony Ive at Apple, you are still going to pay for it.
That shouldn't be a problem. In the hand, it feels great and very much akin to the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS we all raved about over five years ago.
READ MORE: Hands-on impressions New hardware combined with new software is certainly enough for Apple at the moment. The naysayers will say that it's not, that Apple has failed to innovate here and that there isn't much to woo you from Android with its treats and tricks offered by Samsung, Sony, and HTC.
Apple's approach has always been about simplicity, about delivering a device that is easy to use, a device that is the best it can make.
If you look at that remit, Apple's done it again. It hasn't allowed itself to be sidetracked with gimmicks that sound impressive but are never used.
Android users will most likely tell you that they've never used face recognition to unlock their phone, although they've probably tried it.
There is no eye-scrolling tech, movie modes that automatically make films from your footage, or ways to determine what wine you are drinking by snapping the label.
READ MORE: How your finger can become a password
That, from a marketing message, could make the playability of the two devices sound limiting. But Apple prefers the tried and tested solid approach. The phone just works.
These two phones might sway some Android users across and probably sweep up most of the former BlackBerry users.
More importantly, they will open the iPhone to a global audience that is looking for its first smartphone, especially in the new markets like China and Japan.

Ford says he didn't lie about crack use
From Bill Weir, CNN
updated 9:45 AM EST, Mon November 18, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"'Do you smoke crack?' No I don't. Have I? Yeah, OK," Ford tells CNN
Embattled Toronto mayor says "rich and elitist" opponents are attacking him
City Council members have voted to strip him of powers and urged him to take leave
"The people love you," one woman tells Ford
Toronto (CNN) -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford would have admitted to smoking crack cocaine long before his eventual admission, he says. It's just that no one asked him the right question.
After more than five months of denials, Ford admitted that he had indeed smoked crack in a "drunken stupor" about a year ago. The admission came amid a drug investigation that has led to charges against a friend and occasional driver, though not so far against Ford himself.
In a weekend interview with CNN, the leader of Canada's largest city repeated his insistence that he would remain in office and let voters decide his fate next year.
And he defended his earlier denials, saying he never lied to reporters who asked about his drug use.
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford accidentally knocks down Councillor Pam McConnell, in green, as he runs toward hecklers in the audience at City Hall in Toronto, on Monday, November 18. Toronto's City Council voted Friday to strip Ford of his ability to govern in case of an emergency and to appoint and dismiss his senior staff, unprecedented moves aimed at reining him in.
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford reacts to City Council members on Thursday, November 14, after former aides told police they had concerns about his drug use and drunken driving. Ford displays a milk mustache as he takes part in voting with city council members in Toronto on November. 14.
Hundreds gather in Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square on November 13 to call for the Mayor to resign.
Ford responds to Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong's motion for the Mayor to step down and refuses to take a leave on November 13.
Ford addresses the media at City Hall in Toronto on November 5 as he acknowledges that he smoked crack "probably a year ago," when he was in a "drunken stupor," but he refused to resign despite immense pressure to step aside.
Ford denies using crack cocaine during a press conference at City Hall on May 24. On his right is Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday and on his left is his brother Councilor Doug Ford. Allegations that the Mayor had been caught on video smoking crack surfaced in news reports in May. Ford initially insisted the video didn't exist, sidestepped questions about whether he had ever smoked crack and rebuffed growing calls to step down.

"If someone would have said, came up to me and said, 'Have you ever smoked crack? Have you ever smoked weed? I would have said, 'Yeah, I have,' " Ford said. "But when you come and accuse me of being a crack addict and say, 'Do you smoke crack?' No I don't. Have I? Yeah, OK. Have I drank, have I acted like an idiot when I drank? Yeah, I did."
Ford said he's not a drug addict. He said his conduct was "absolutely wrong," but added, "I am moving on."

A man of contrasts, Ford leads his 'nation' in controversy
Speaking at a weekend toy drive in the blue-collar City Council district that his brother Doug now represents, Ford said he was "sick and tired of all the allegations and all this bulls--t."
"Sorry, kids -- I shouldn't have sworn in front of the kids," he said. "But after a while, I know what I'm doing is right. I'm serving people. I'm saving taxpayers money. And you know what, I made mistakes, I drank too much, I smoked some crack sometime. What can I say? I made a mistake, I'm human."
The Toronto Star has reported that Ford was asked "countless times" whether he had used drugs while mayor, without an answer. Ford accused the newspaper of mounting a vendetta against him on behalf of his "rich and elitist" political opponents.
Ford was elected to a four-year term in 2010 and has touted tax cuts and streamlined government under his administration. But while he's often characterized as conservative, Doug Ford said his brother is "a huge, massive social liberal" who loves U.S. President Barack Obama.
Reporter's notebook: In the heart of Ford nation with embattled mayor
Rob Ford added, "My specialty is taking care of people that have been totally ignored their whole life, and I'm not going to stop doing it."
Since his November 5 admission, documents released by a court have outlined more allegations of drug use, drunkenness and alleged verbal and physical abuse of aides. In the course of answering those allegations on Thursday, he denied a female staffer's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own, stunning reporters and leading to another apology.
On Wednesday, Toronto's City Council called for him to take a leave of absence. On Friday, the council voted to strip him of his ability to govern in an emergency and to appoint and dismiss committee chairs. Monday, members are expected to take up a measure that would delegate duties not assigned by statute to the mayor, effectively stripping Ford of most of his responsibilities.
But in the northwestern neigborhood of Rexdale, a diverse community in the heart of the "Ford Nation," the mayor and his brother were met with cheers by the knot of well-wishers who joined him at the toy drive.
"The people love you," one woman told him.

Russian ship stuck in ice near Antarctica
By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 10:08 AM EST, Thu December 26, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Polar expedition ship with 74 aboard sends a Christmas distress signal
Three icebreakers are heading for the trapped vessel
The ship is stuck near Antarctica, 1,500 nautical miles south of Tasmania
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is coordinating the rescue
(CNN) -- Passengers on a Russian polar expedition ship off Antarctica are getting a whiter Christmas than they probably wanted.
The MV Akademik Shokalskiy, with 74 people aboard, got trapped in ice and is waiting for other ships with ice-breaking capabilities to reach it, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Wednesday.
A British rescue coordination center received a satellite distress signal on Christmas morning from the Russian-flagged ship and contacted the Australian authority, which handles the Southern Ocean region where the vessel was stuck, an AMSA statement said.
It pinpointed the trapped ship's location as 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania.
Three icebreakers were headed to help the Russian vessel, the AMSA statement said, adding that none were expected to reach it before Friday.
Expeditions Online, a polar booking agent for the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, said on its website that the ship got stuck "part way through her Australasian Antarctic Expedition towards Mawson's Hut at Cape Denison."
"According to reports, nobody is in present danger and three nearby icebreakers are being sent to assist," the Expeditions Online website said.
It described the ship as "a fully ice-strengthened expedition vessel" for working in polar regions.
"This class of vessel is world-renowned for polar exploration, because of its strength, maneuverability and small passenger numbers," the company's website said.
CNN's Kevin Wang contributed to this report.
