CORAL GABLES, Florida (CNN) -- The following is a transcript of the first section of the debate between President Bush and Sen. John Kerry held Thursday night at the University of Miami. The topic of the debate was foreign affairs and, and the moderator was Jim Lehrer of PBS. The transcript is divided by questions and a link to the next section is at the bottom of the page and in the box on the right.LEHRER: Good evening from the University of Miami Convocation Center in Coral Gables, Florida. I'm Jim Lehrer of "The NewsHour" on PBS.And I welcome you to the first of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee.These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.Tonight's will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce their rules on them.The umbrella topic is foreign policy and homeland security, but the specific subjects were chosen by me, the questions were composed by me, the candidates have not been told what they are, nor has anyone else.For each question there can only be a two-minute response, a 90-second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute.A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means time's up. There is also a backup buzzer system if needed.Candidates may not direct a question to each other. There will be two-minute closing statements, but no opening statements.There is an audience here in the hall, but they will remain absolutely silent for the next 90 minutes, except for now, when they join me in welcoming President Bush and Senator Kerry.Good evening, Mr. President, Senator Kerry.As determined by a coin toss, the first question goes to you, Senator Kerry. You have two minutes.Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11-type terrorist attack on the United States?KERRY: Yes, I do.But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you. And we admire your pluck and perseverance.I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally. But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.I'll never give a veto to any country over our security. But I also know how to lead those alliances.This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.LEHRER: Mr. President, you have a 90-second rebuttal.BUSH: I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.We pursued Al Qaeda wherever Al Qaeda tries to hide. Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaeda leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know we're after them.We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it.We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.Libya has disarmed. The A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice.And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror. Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people. Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.Next question: Would a Kerry win increase risk of terror?Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

(CNN) -- Sue Compton is having a pretty sweet day. She's a newly minted millionaire, courtesy of her Pillsbury Bake-Off win, announced live Wednesday morning on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." Her original recipe for Mini Ice Cream Cookie Cups took top honors in the 44th annual contest. The winning baker said it wasn't a stove-slaving process of trial and error for her. "Just once and done. For real. It just came together and I'm very lucky." She sought inspiration from the list of potential ingredients required by Pillsbury -- eligible recipes must include two, in specified minimum quantities -- and wandered the aisles of her local market. "The ideas came as a result of trying to combine ingredients I thought would taste good together," she said. iReport: Share your bake sale memories and recipes Compton said she doesn't anticipate getting tired of serving up her now-signature dish -- "I like desserts a lot, and you don't see people getting tired of cookies or ice cream" -- or making a foray into the professional baking arena. "I don't see living my life any differently. I'd just like to put the money toward my retirement." The Delanco, New Jersey, woman took the top prize by whisking past stiff competition like Evelyn Henderson's Salmon Pecan-Crusted Tartlets, Kellie White's Zesty Lime Fish Tacos and Niki Plourde's Tomato Basil Eggs Alfredo in Bread Baskets. Contestants, who must be amateurs, have been tossing their toques into the ring since the Bake-Off's inception in 1949. That year, Theodora Smafield of Rockford, Illinois, took home $50,000 for her No-Knead Water-Rising Twists recipe -- a sum doubled from the advertised $25,000 pot by a promotional token that she'd run across two months before. Though her initial win stirred a national obsession with the contest, it still took 44 years for a man -- Kurt Wait -- to rise to the top with a Macadamia Fudge Torte in 1996. The finished dishes are judged on taste, appearance, creativity and consumer appeal. Here is the winning recipe for Mini Ice Cream Cookie Cups: Servings: Makes 24 tartlets Ingredients: • 1 package (16 ounces) Pillsbury Ready to Bake refrigerated sugar cookies (24 cookies) • 4 teaspoons sugar • 1/3 cup finely chopped Fisher Chef's Naturals walnuts • ½ cup Hershey's semisweet chocolate baking chips • ¼ cup Smucker's Seedless Red Raspberry Jam • 1½ cups vanilla bean ice cream, softened • 24 fresh raspberries Prep time: 20 minutes. Start to finish: 45 minutes Directions: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 24 mini muffin cups with Crisco Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Place a cookie dough round in each muffin cup. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Place 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a small bowl. Dip the end of a wooden spoon handle in the sugar and carefully press into the center of each cookie to make a 1-inch-wide indentation. Cool completely in a pan for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix walnuts and remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar, then set aside. In a small microwaveable bowl, microwave chocolate chips uncovered on high for 30 to 60 seconds, stirring after 30 seconds, until smooth. Run a knife around the edges of the cups to loosen, and gently remove them from the pan. Dip the rim of each cup into the melted chocolate, then into the walnut mixture. Place the walnut side up on a cookie sheet with sides. In another small microwaveable bowl, microwave the jam uncovered on high for about 15 seconds until melted. Spoon a half-teaspoon of jam into each cup. Freeze cups for about five minutes or until the chocolate is set. Spoon the ice cream into the cups, using a small cookie scoop or measuring tablespoon. Top each cup with a fresh raspberry. Store in the freezer, then let stand at room temperature for five minutes before serving. Nutritional Information: In one serving, there are: Calories: 150 (calories from fat: 70); total fat: 7 grams (saturated fat 2½ grams, trans fat: 1½ grams); cholesterol: 0 milligrams; sodium: 60 milligrams; total carbohydrates: 19 grams (dietary fiber: 0 grams, sugars: 12 grams); protein: 1 gram.

Is WikiLeaks engaged in 'cyber war'?By John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Innovation Rival hackers have hit WikiLeaks and its enemies with "denial of service" attacks, causing some havoc online. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Media and Twitter feeds declare the website attacks involving WikiLeaks a "cyber war" But security experts say this is nothing like a real cyber war Expert: Cyber attacks start to become war-like when they attack real-world targets (CNN) -- Media outlets and a Twitter feed this week lobbed a controversial term into the public debate about cyber attacks over WikiLeaks: "CYBERWAR," the WikiLeaks' European Twitter feed declared, linking to a blog post of the same title. "WikiLeaks Cyberwar!" read a CBS blog headline. "Cyberwar erupts over WikiLeaks funding cut," wrote RFI, the international public radio network. Despite these bold proclamations, internet security experts said the WikiLeaks-related attacks are anything but cyber war -- not that these same experts are exactly sure what a cyber war would look like, or if one has ever occurred. The WikiLeaks saga reads like a high-tech spy novel -- one packed with government secrets, icy Cold War bunkers, shady networks of anonymous hackers and, most recently, the disruption of American financial institutions. The battle over the site -- which has come under fire from the United States for publishing private diplomatic communications -- escalated this week as apparent WikiLeaks' supporters crashed the websites of PayPal, Visa and MasterCard, which had stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks. What is WikiLeaks? Here's how it works
WikiLeaks supporters strike back
Timeline of the WikiLeaks controversy
"There are some things WikiLeaks can't do. For everything else, there's Operation Payback," wrote a Twitter user claiming responsibility for the attacks -- and giving them a snappy name. That scared plenty of people, even though the credit card companies continued to operate without their Web presence. To many, it also felt unprecedented, like these attacks were a new way to rattle core institutions of the American economy. But is this kind of thing really new? And what does one call this type of digital battle, where attacks result in the unwanted movement of 1s and 0s online rather than bombed-out buildings and wounded soldiers? Maybe anything but a cyber war. Calling the WikiLeaks back-and-forth a cyber war is "completely idiotic," said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer of BT, a communications company. "War. W-A-R. It's a big word," Schneier said. "How could this be a cyber war? It's certainly a cyber attack, right? It's certainly politically motivated. But this stuff has been going on for a couple of decades now. Do you mean there have been thousands of wars that haven't been noticed? It doesn't make any sense at all. If there was a war, you'd know it, and it would probably involve tanks and artillery -- as well as cyber weapons." Only cyber attacks between two warring nation-states count as cyber war, he said. WikiLeaks is, of course, a website -- not a sovereign nation. "War isn't just nameless attacks between parties that are not nation-states to begin with," said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure. "WikiLeaks is not a country. MasterCard is not a country." RELATED TOPICS

But perhaps that definition still isn't quite good enough. In war, it's usually pretty easy to tell who's doing the shooting. In cyber attacks, it's almost always impossible to determine the origins of an attack unless it's "perpetuated by the slip of the tongue" on the part of the attacker, said Don DeBolt, director of threat research at CA Technologies, a computer security company. In the WikiLeaks case, for example, no one knows -- or may ever know -- who is behind the attacks on financial websites. The same goes for hackers standing on the other side of the digital battlefield, who have been trying to take WikiLeaks down so that it can't share any more state secrets. The United States government has denied involvement, but the situation raises a question: If it's almost impossible to know who's behind a cyber attack, how can you say whether one has taken place between two nation-states or not? Another issue with cyber war is the type of attack that's used. Security researchers said the tactics of cyber warfare have been deployed in the WikiLeaks saga, but they're by far not the most drastic measures a hacker would take if he or she really wanted to cause real damage. Schneier compared the pro-WikiLeaks attacks on MasterCard and Visa to a bunch of protesters standing in front of an office building, refusing to let workers in. It's annoying, but it didn't shut down the operation. And it didn't start a war. Cyber attacks start to become war-like when they purposefully attack real-world targets, causing actual damage to property or death, Hypponen said. That had never been shown to be possible until this year, when the Stuxnet worm showed that it could attack factory systems and alter mechanical processes, he said. That kind of virus could, in theory, be used to shut down power grids, halt public transportation or blow up factories, he said. The WikiLeaks attacks are more like political protests, he said. There's an insider term for this: "hacktivist," or hacker plus activist. "I see it mostly as a demonstration of their dissatisfaction with the system and how things are going," he said of the hackers who are defending WikiLeaks by targeting big-name American sites. "There are other points you'd want to hit if you wanted to inflict monetary damage or retribution." The type of attacks pro-WikiLeaks hackers have been carrying out are not at all sophisticated; they actually have been going on for at least 10 years, he said. Called "direct denial of service" attacks -- or DDoS in geek-speak -- these attacks essentially try to overload a website with so much internet traffic that they can't handle the load and temporarily are shut down. DDoS attacks have been used as a form of protest before. What's new with WikiLeaks, Hypponen said, is that DDoS attacks have gotten so easy to carry out that almost anyone can participate. There's evidence that "hundreds" of WikiLeaks supporters have volunteered their computers to be used as weapons in these online assaults, said Jose Nazario, senior manager of security research at Arbor Networks, another security firm. To sign up, you just have to find the right people on Facebook or Twitter and download a simple program with another spy-novel name: a "low-orbit ion cannon." "Ten years ago you had to be pretty skilled and know the right people to gain entry into this sort of event. Now it's easy," he said. Still, that doesn't completely settle the "cyber war" issue either. In real-world war, you can fight with swords -- old tools -- or remotely operated drones -- new tools -- and still be engaging in battle. Perhaps part of the definition of cyber war lies in exactly how those tools are used to inflict damage, said Herbert Lin, a computer science and security expert at the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. "Soldiers use M16s. And they can use them in a prosecution of a war," Lin said. "But policemen also use M16s, and they're not prosecuting a war. So the question here is, does it count to say if you're using cyber warfare techniques against WikiLeaks in various forms, is that cyber warfare?" Lin answered his own question: "I'd say no."

The top 10 tech 'fails' of 2012
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 5:21 PM EST, Fri January 4, 2013 | Filed under: Web
Apple Maps looked beautiful. Unfortunately, many users soon found the app wasn't so good at ... well ... mapping. Landmarks such as the Washington Monument showed up submerged in bodies of water. Oops.
Facebook's initial public offering in May got buzz like few stocks in the history of the market. Not nearly as many investors clicked "like" as they would have hoped, though, and the stock soon slumped. Google's media streaming device, the Nexus Q, looks totally fun. Sadly, it was sort of hard to figure out what it's supposed to do.
Remember the Color photo-sharing app that arrived last year with much fanfare and millions in backing? No? It never caught on with users and will shut down December 31.
Daily-deals services like Groupon and LivingSocial were all the rage a few years ago. Then, inbox fatigue and other factors cut into their appeal. Groupon's stock value has plummeted 75%.
Congress may want to stop trying to regulate the Web for a while. When you make every major player on the Internet unhappy -- which the Stop Online Piracy Act did -- they will use the Internet to defeat you. Just because smartphones and GPS can hook us up with nearby strangers doesn't mean that people won't find the whole deal a little creepy. Great, we like the same band -- now leave me alone.
Airtime, a video-chat service created by tech hotshots Sean Parker, left, and Shawn Fanning, launched with a glitzy party in June. Four months later, it had just 10,000 active users.
Social game "Draw Something" started with a bang this year but fizzled fast. It was another ominous sign for new owner Zynga, the once-hot "FarmVille" maker whose income tumbled in 2012.
If you say dumb things on Twitter, people will notice. And they will mock you. A lot. This gracious tweet from singer Chris Brown was just one of many shining examples from 2012.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN Tech lists the top 10 tech misfires of 2012
Apple dumped Google Maps, then made a mess of its own maps
Facebook's stock offering was massively hyped, then underwhelmed
Slumping games, pricey "Draw Something" purchase stung Zynga
(CNN) -- Well, you can't win 'em all.
In 2012, we saw big tech advances. Smartphones got bigger. Tablets got smaller. Social media played a role in everything from a presidential election to disaster relief.
But with advances come clunkers.
When you're in a field that demands near-constant innovation and unprecedented levels of creativity, sometimes even the most successful players are going to shoot and miss.
So, at the risk of playing Scrooge in this season of good will, here we come to wallow in it. Because, let's face it: The Internet loves a good fail.
Behold the top 10 tech "fails" of 2012, with wishes for happier days ahead to all involved.
Apple Maps
Apple's unofficial slogan, "It Just Works," took a beating on this one.
Along with the rollout of the much anticipated iPhone 5 in September, Apple overhauled iOS, the operating system that runs the phone, its iPad and other mobile devices. A much-hyped feature of the change was Apple's first effort at its own mapping app -- after dumping rival Google's map software.
The result was so bad that a few days later Apple's CEO was essentially telling customers to use Google Maps.
Entire cities appeared in the wrong place. Landmarks such as the Washington Monument showed up submerged in bodies of water, and big chunks of the globe appeared as roadless wastelands.
"At Apple, we strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers," CEO Tim Cook wrote in a rare apology. "With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment. We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better."
It was a little more than a month later when Scott Forstall, vice president in charge of iOS, was ousted from the company, reportedly, in part, for not wanting to apologize for Maps.
The company has been gradually improving Maps, but as recently as this month Australian police complained that an Apple Maps glitch could endanger motorists by mislocating a city of 30,000 people in the middle of the outback.
The top 12 tech stories of 2012
Facebook's IPO
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in New York before his company's initial public offering.
Everybody uses Facebook. And everybody likes to make money. So everybody's going to gobble up Facebook stock, right?
So went the conventional thinking -- at least among those of us who spend more time thinking about mobile phones than mutual funds. But on Wall Street? Not so much.
It's hard to remember a stock opening more hyped than Facebook's when it hit the market in May. The stock began the day worth about $38. Then, after what everyone predicted to be a dynamic day of trading for the social media superstar, it closed at ... well ... about $38.
It wouldn't take long for the pinstripe-suit types to decide it wasn't even worth that. Facebook's stock bottomed out in September, falling below $18. Since then, it's been steadily rebounding and currently sells for about $28.
Facebook says it has solid financial plans for the future. And the stock may well keep climbing, eventually turning a profit for folks who bought early.
But that fateful day in May will be a reminder that Wall Street and Silicon Valley don't always play well together.
Airtime
When the man who created Napster and helped launch Facebook talks, the tech industry listens.
And when Sean Parker and partner Shawn Fanning tease something new called Airtime, techies fall all over themselves to see what the next great innovation will be.
But then, at a fancy launch event featuring celebrities such as Alicia Keys and Snoop Dogg, Parker announces that it's ... basically, a random Web chat tool.
Cue the collective, "Huh?"
It didn't help that, at that fancy event, Airtime crashed over and over again. Or that folks had a hard time seeing how it would be different than Chatroulette (although Parker promised more users would actually be wearing pants).
In October, Parker admitted that Airtme, launched with more than $33 million in backing, had just 10,000 active users. (That's $3,300 spent per user, if you're scoring along at home.)
"Running a startup is like eating glass," he said at the All Things D conference. "You just start to like the taste of your own blood."
Ouch.
Online coupons
"These aren't your grandma's coupons!" the digital generation so brashly declared.
With their mobile apps and irreverent style, daily-deal offerings such as Groupon and Living Social were all the rage as 2012 dawned.
Now? Um, not so much.
Groupon, perhaps the best-known player in the field, watched its value plummet 79% in 2012. Its stock value dropped about three-quarters since opening in November 2011 as high-profile investors washed their hands of it.
And this is the company Google reportedly tried to buy for $6 billion in 2010.
LivingSocial, meanwhile, announced last month it was laying off 400 people. That's after announcing months of revenue losses.
So what happened? Inbox fatigue made some users stop checking the deals. A glut of offers you don't care about (pottery classes?) can make your eyes glaze over. And some businesses quit making offers, saying they never saw the promised returns on their investment.
Nexus Q
When Google gets something right, they get it really, really right.
Redefining Web search? Yep. World's leading mobile system? Check. A car that drives itself? Vroom!
But some of the Big G's outings in the gadget world have hit with a thud. Enter ... the Nexus Q.
The size and shape of a Magic Eight Ball, the Nexus Q is (or was ... it's hard to say) a media streamer that uses Android to play audio and video. It's also made in the United States, no small thing in a world where virtually all gadgets come from China.
Unfortunately, in the grand tradition of Google Wave, nobody really knew what it was when it was released in June. Its release date was pushed back and, eventually, Google just gave everybody who pre-ordered a free one.
The Q has not officially been canned. But on Google's online store, the never-released gadget is listed as "not available at this time."
Stop Online Piracy Act
People protest the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act in January in New York.
The new law was supposed to be about fighting online piracy. Who's going to be against that, right?
Answer: Pretty much the whole Internet.
Members of Congress sponsored the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, and related bills to make it easier to shut down websites that illegally share music, movies and other content.
But opponents argued it went too far and could end up shutting down legitimate sites while stifling free expression in the process.
Unfortunately for backers of SOPA, Web heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Reddit and Wikipedia joined the fight against the bill. Sites went black on January 18 to raise awareness. Members of communities such as Reddit put intense pressure on lawmakers (including soon-to-be GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan) until they dropped their support or went on record opposing the bill.
The unprecedented backlash eventually caused supporters to shelve SOPA, and quite possibly ushered in a new age of Web activism.
'Social discovery' apps
If the first wave of social networking was about hooking up with friends, the next wave would be about meeting strangers -- or so the thinking went.
Tech-world pundits predicted a new wave of "social discovery" apps that would change the way we meet people. The basic idea was that, by using phones' GPS, users could see who else was nearby and then meet up with other users with shared friends or similar interests.
"If we get this right, I cannot think of a bigger thing to be working on right now," Paul Davison, CEO of the app Highlight, told CNN in June. "We can take billions and billions of dollars."
Significantly, he also chose not to tell a reporter how many users the app had at the time.
Banjo and Glancee were apps that did something similar. Others, such as Skout and Grindr, were even more specific -- they let you hunt down willing partners for a quick hookup.
But here's the thing -- some users, particularly women, found the apps a little creepy.
OK, so you know that somebody sitting in the same bar as you likes the Pixies, "Firefly," the fantasy stylings of George R.R. Martin and the Atlanta Braves. Are you really just going to start waving around your smartphone to get their attention?
Sure, they've got good taste. But they still might be jerks.
Color
It was supposed to be a tech-world slam-dunk. Instead, it became a cautionary tale about what some feel could become a tech "bubble."
Color, a photo-sharing mobile app, stoked excitement in the startup community that was virtually unrivaled. Before it had a single user, Color had raised $41 million from investors. So certain were its Silicon Valley creators that, reportedly, they turned down a $200 million buyout offer from Google.
With much fanfare, Color launched in March 2011. But users soon complained that the app, designed to share photos with the people around you, often didn't find anyone for them to share with. Its creators were forced to announce they were working on a major overhaul on the same day it was released.
Color tallied about 1 million users at its peak and, more recently, was reportedly down to about 100,000. Compare that to the roughly 100 million users of photo app Instagram (it had about 27 million when Facebook bought it last year), and you see the problem.
Color will be shutting down on New Year's Eve.
Zynga
Zynga is the maker of such social games as the popular "Words With Friends."
It reads like an old VH1 "Behind the Music" episode.
"Zynga was riding high. Love them or hate them, its games like "Mafia Wars" and "FarmVille" were everywhere, clogging up Facebook pages and spurring millions of bored casual gamers to pay real cash for virtual cows. Then, it all came crumbling down."
OK, maybe "crumbling down" is an overstatement. But things in The 'Ville definitely didn't go Zynga's way in 2012.
In October, Zynga announced it was laying off 5% of its employees, shutting down its studio in Boston and proposing the closure of others in Japan and England.
(It would be entirely cynical to suggest Zynga hoped to bury that news by making the announcement during Apple's much-hyped iPad Mini event. So we won't suggest that here.)
Facebook, which gets a cut when people spend money on games such as "FarmVille," said that income from Zynga was down 20% over last year.
And, like unskilled mafia warriors, Zynga shot itself in the foot again in March when it bought the company that makes mobile game "Draw Something" for an eye-popping $180 million. But fascination with "Draw Something" dropped off fast. When's the last time you played?
Twitter twits
OK, so you can post something stupid anywhere. But there's something about Twitter's rapid-fire, 140-character bursts that brings out the stupid in people.
From companies embarrassing themselves to celebrities behaving badly, it's hard to name just one Twitter doofus. But here are a few nominees:
• Chris Brown, the hip-hop star, consistently used Twitter to make himself look like a foul-mouthed rage monster. Instead of thanking fans after winning a Grammy, he launched a profanity-laced bromide at his "haters." Then there were the misogynistic, scatological insults he hurled at comedian-critic Jenny Johnson before "quitting" Twitter. (He's back.)
• McDonald's thought it would get a little of that social media love it had been hearing about in January when it created the #McDstories hashtag -- asking customers to share their favorite McDonald's memories. Then it found out what happens when you give the Internet open access to your advertising effort. McDonald's yanked the campaign after just two hours and countless food-horror stories about fingernails, insects and bouts of food poisoning.
• Spike Lee was, like many Twitter users, angered by the killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin. Tweeting the home address of shooter George Zimmerman would have been questionable enough. But Lee mistakenly tweeted out the address of a couple who have a son by that name. They had to leave their home after being besieged by reporters and threats. Lee would later apologize and "reach an agreement" with the aggrieved family.
• Greek triple jumper Paraskevi Papachristou was on her way to the Olympics when she tried a little ill-advised Twitter humor. With so many African Olympians in London, "the West Nile mosquitoes will at least eat homemade food!" she wrote. Her tweet was quickly criticized as racially insensitive, and Greece's Olympic Committee barred her from participating in the Games.
• Oprah Winfrey had been gushing for weeks about how much she loved the new Microsoft Surface tablet, culminating in this tweet: "Gotta say love that SURFACE! Have bought 12 already for Christmas gifts." Unfortunately for her, those words were followed by ... "via Twitter for iPad."

Actress Valerie Harper lives in the moment after cancer diagnosis By Dana Ford, CNN
updated 7:35 AM EDT, Wed March 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: She talks to "Piers Morgan Live" on Tuesday night Harper, 73, is best known for her work on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Rhoda"
She was recently diagnosed with a rare and terminal type of brain cancer
"I have had a magnificent run ... I really look at my life as blessed," she says
(CNN) -- Sitcom star Valerie Harper might not have much time left on Earth, but she is determined to live life to the fullest.
"I just want folks to see me, that I'm OK, that I'm not suffering so far," said Harper, who was recently diagnosed with a rare and terminal type of brain cancer. "There may be pain. There may be a lot of things ahead, but whatever they are, they're ahead. They're not now."
Harper, 73, is best known for playing Rhoda Morgenstern on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," and its spinoff, "Rhoda." Like Harper in real life, Rhoda was outgoing and had a smile that lit up the screen.
The actress told CNN's "Piers Morgan Live" on Tuesday night that she feels good and hasn't had any side effects from treatment.
Opinion: My open source cure for brain cancer
She said she is trying to live in the moment and had this advice: "Keep your chin up and don't go to the funeral, mine or yours or your loved ones, until the day of the funeral because then you miss the life that you have left."
Valerie Harper stopped by "Piers Morgan Live" on Tuesday in a prime-time exclusive. The actress, who played Mary Richards' best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern, on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," recently revealed to People magazine that she has terminal brain cancer. The following is a celebration of some of TV's other most beloved sidekicks:
Vivian Vance's Ethel Mertz was always there to help her best friend out of a jam on "I Love Lucy." Unless, of course, she and Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) were in a jam together -- in which case hilarity was certain to ensue. Before becoming the breakout star of "Family Matters," Jaleel White's Steve Urkel was just the Winslow family's nerdy neighbor. Madly in love with Laura, Urkel routinely offered to help out her brother Eddie.
Andrew Koenig played "Boner" on a mere 25 episodes of "Growing Pains," but he left a lasting impression as the best friend of Mike Seaver (Kirk Cameron).
Jay Silverheels played faithful companion Tonto to Clayton Moore's Lone Ranger on "The Lone Ranger," which ran from 1949 to 1957 on ABC.
Steven Van Zandt portrayed Silvio, consigliere of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), on HBO's "The Sopranos." The Bada Bing strip club owner was known for always keeping his cool.
Gilligan (Bob Denver) was always there for his captain, the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.), on "Gilligan's Island." Despite occasionally conking his "Little Buddy" on the head, the Skipper remained friends with Gilligan to the end. Don Knotts played Barney Fife on "The Andy Griffith Show." Despite the occasional gaffe, the deputy sheriff was always there for Andy and Opie.
Burt Ward played Dick Grayson, also known as Batman's loyal sidekick Robin, on the 1966 series created by Bob Kane. Robin helped Bruce Wayne defend Gotham City on "Batman" until the show went off the air in 1968.
Jason Alexander's George Costanza plays Jerry's best friend on the hugely successful "Seinfeld," which ran for nine seasons on NBC.
On "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," Bob Denver played beatnik Maynard G. Krebs opposite Dwayne Hickman's Dobie Gillis. Our favorite TV sidekicks

Harper: Remember me 'off the couch'
Harper's moments: Marriage, motherhood
News of Harper's illness was first reported by People magazine. It says she was told in January that she has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a condition in which cancer cells spread into the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.
Harpers' doctors say she could have as little as three months to live, People reported.
"The disease I have is quite a rare cancer and it is located in a limited area -- a very widespread area, but narrow. So a lot can happen if the cancer starts getting really aggressive, pressing on parts of the brain and causing me to lose either my speech or my ability to think, etc," Harper told Morgan.
But for now, she said, she is focused on putting one foot in front of the other, doing book tours, exercising, "just living my life."
An uncertain journey with brain cancer
"Death is out there for all of us," she said. "There's other ways to handle it than just sit on the couch and accept."
Harper previously battled lung cancer.
Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which is also known as neoplastic meningitis, affects approximately 5% of cancer patients, according to the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.
It is a difficult disease to treat because chemotherapy drugs often do not reach powerful enough concentrations in the membranes to be effective, the center said. Treatment can include radiation therapy and chemotherapy delivered straight to the spinal fluid.
"I have had a magnificent run -- the most wonderful husband in the world for 34 years, a great career," Harper said. "I really look at my life as blessed."

Anti-drone bill advances in Florida
By Chuck Johnston and Matt Smith, CNN
updated 4:02 PM EDT, Wed April 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The bill would require a judge's permission to use drones in most cases
Gov. Rick Scott and the ACLU both support the measure
It still has to pass the state House of Representatives
(CNN) -- Florida state senators voted Wednesday to restrict the use of unmanned aircraft by police, approving a bill backed by both the state's conservative Republican governor and the ACLU.
The Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act would require a judge to sign off on the use of surveillance drones in nearly all cases. The legislation makes exceptions in cases involving "imminent danger to life or serious damage to property" and when "credible intelligence" from the federal Department of Homeland Security points to "a high risk of a terrorist attack."
The bill is headed for the state House of Representatives after Wednesday's 39-0 vote in the Senate. If it makes it through the House, Gov. Rick Scott says he'll have his pen ready.
"I believe that privacy should be protected," Scott said in a paper statement, adding, "This law will ensure that the rights of Florida families are protected from the unwarranted use of drones and other unmanned aircraft."
The use of drones has become controversial in recent years as unmanned aerial vehicles have become cheaper and more advanced. The concerns range from moral questions over their use in warfare overseas to worries about their impact on air traffic in the United States.
"We are pleased that SB 92 was passed with such enthusiasm by the Florida Senate. Because of the Senate's action, our state is on pace to be the one of the first to protect privacy by putting limits on the use of unmanned surveillance drones, " Ron Bilbao of the ACLU of Florida said in a written statement.
In Florida, the Miami-Dade Police Department and the Orange County Sheriff Department each have two drones. Miami-Dade's roughly backpack-sized Honeywell T-Hawks have been used only in training exercises so far, Detective Roy Rutland said.
