Students interrupt Iran president
Story Highlights• NEW: Group of students interrupt speech by Iran president, agency says • They chant "death to dictator" before attacking TV crew, report says • Spokesman for Ahmadinejad's office downplays incident Adjust font size:
TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian students have staged a rare demonstration against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, setting off firecrackers and burning pictures of him as he delivered a speech at Tehran university, reports said. Iran's semi-official FARS news agency and a student news Web site reported that a group of students Monday briefly interrupted Ahmadinejad's speech at Amir Kabir University by booing and chanting "Death to the dictator." A student who attended the speech but did not want to be named confirmed those reports to CNN.But Iran's official state-run news agency, IRNA, said the students "expressed their views in a cordial atmosphere," and chanted "Down with dictators," which was met with agreement by Ahmadinejad, who denounced the "dictatorships" in the United States and Britain.A spokesman for Ahmadinejad's office downplayed the incident, saying that the students burned some papers but it was not clear if they were pictures of the president, as others reported.The spokesman confirmed some firecrackers were set off during the speech, and that students shouted "Death to the dictator" or "dictatorship" but said they could have been referring to London or Washington.And while there was some pushing and verbal arguments among students in the crowd, the spokesman, said he was present at the speech and saw no scuffles or fisticuffs.He said some students approached Ahmadinejad after the speech and the president listened to their criticisms and requests, and assured them they would not be harassed or arrested for the incident.However, an Amir Kabir University student, who witnessed the incident and did not want to be identified, told CNN that the protesting students interrupted Ahmadinejad's speech with slogans, including "Death to the dictator," "Get lost Basijis" -- a reference to right-wing students who support the government -- "Get lost liars" -- referring to the state-run press -- and "Political prisoners must be freed."The student also said he witnessed the protesters burning pictures of Ahmadinejad, tossing firecrackers, and fighting with the pro-Tehran students.The student told CNN the protesters were lined up in the back of the auditorium where the speech was held, holding posters of students that they believe are in Iranian prisons, and the pro-Tehran students were grabbing the posters out of their hands.The pro-Tehran students held posters of Ayatollah Khomenei, the founder of the Islamic Republic, and tried to drown out the protesters with "Death to America" chants and loud clapping -- especially when the TV cameras panned toward the audience -- the student told CNN.Cameras brokenMany right-wing students from other universities more supportive of the Tehran regime were brought to the speech beforehand, the student said. Several security guards tried to prevent the Amir Kabir students from entering the auditorium, allowing only female students, the student said. But the guards were eventually overcome by a swarm of students, the student said.According to the student news Web site, ADWAR, the protesters were members of Amir Kabir University's Islamic Students Association, a reformist group that has lost its influence since Ahmadinejad took power last year.The president's speech was interrupted several times by students, ADWAR reported.Ahmadinejad responded by accusing the protesting students of having no shame and being on the payroll of the United States, according to ADWAR. But he added that he loved each one of them and said, "You insult me but I will respond to you calmly."The protesters also broke the cameras of Iranian state TV, according to FARS news agency."A small number of who claim there is suppression here are themselves creating a suppressive atmosphere and will not allow the majority to listen," FARS quoted Ahmadinejad as saying.ADWAR said that after Ahmadinejad's Student Day speech, the pro-Ahmadinejad students were waiting for buses to take them back to their universities of Emam Sadeq and Emam Hossein.Iranian state TV reported on the president's speech, but made no mention of the protest.On its English-language Web site, IRNA said Ahmadinejad held "sincere talks" with the students and "during the three-hour meeting, representatives of various student groups expressed their views in a cordial atmosphere."IRNA also reported on the protesting students, but gave the impression the students were not referring to Ahmadinejad as a dictator:"In response to the students slogans of 'Down with Dictators', the president said, 'We have been standing up to dictatorship so that no one will dare to establish dictatorship in a millennium even in the name of freedom.'"'Given the scars inflicted on the Iranian nation by agents of the U.S. and British dictatorship, no one will ever dare to initiate the rise of a dictator,' the president said."Journalist Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.

In GOP presidential field, only three are for real By John P. Avlon, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSJohn Avlon: There are 3 serious GOP presidential candidates: Huntsman, Romney, Pawlenty He says the 6 others are either self-promoters or idea-promoters, not president materialHe says it's not new, but still debases democracy when candidates are not really seriousAvlon: Reality TV driven culture makes it worse; people run who aren't qualified, voters loseEditor's note: John P. Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for The Daily Beast. He is the author of "Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America." (CNN) -- There are three ways to run for president these days. The first is to run to promote yourself. The second is to run to promote ideas. The third is to actually run for president of the United States. The Republican presidential hopefuls running on this old-fashioned third notion are a distinct minority. And that says a lot about the state of our politics: bread and circuses meets reality TV. Mitt Romney and the newly declared Jon Huntsman are definitely running for president. So is Tim Pawlenty (although his whiffed pitch at CNN's New Hampshire debate gave many the sense that he is really angling for a VP-slot). These three folks have done the hard work of actually putting together a presidential campaign team, raising money and defining their positions. Running for president -- and preparing for the responsibilities of the office -- is serious business. They are taking it seriously. Running for president to advance ideas is itself a time-honored approach. Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and congressman Shirley Chisholm ran for president to help advance women's rights and civil rights. Socialist Eugene Debs ran for president in the early 1900s (once from prison). Conservative Barry Goldwater defeated New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for the GOP nomination in 1964, championing the libertarian-conservative cause before being defeated by President Lyndon Johnson. Likewise, Ross Perot's independent campaign in 1992 helped elevate the issue of the deficit to national prominence, paving the way for the balanced budgets of the late 1990s.

Elections and Voting
Election Campaigns
Ron Paul, Gary Johnson and Newt Gingrich are running in this tradition -- none are likely to actually win the nomination, but their presence helps shape the debate. Paul and Johnson advance the libertarian cause that is (thankfully) on the rise in the GOP, especially among the youthful grassroots. Paul gets points for philosophic consistency when it comes to the now-fashionable criticisms of the Bush Doctrine, deficits and the debt. Gary Johnson's libertarian bona fides extend to social issues as well as fiscal and he has the added distinction of serving as a successful two-term governor of a swing state -- New Mexico -- giving him executive experience as well. Newt Gingrich soldiers on despite being fired by his entire senior staff, because he wants to be part of the national debate. This forceful professorial approach is something the former Speaker of the House is good at -- and his honesty about the need for (and obstacles to) immigration reform was a substantive highlight of the New Hampshire debate. There's no doubt that Newt would be pleased to wake up and find himself president, but doing the hard work of campaigning for the office doesn't seem to hold the same appeal. He is running as a candidate of ideas -- and that doesn't require a body man or baggage -- handler. And then there's the self-promotional approach to running for president. In our recent past, this slot has been occupied most boastfully by Al Sharpton, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2004. He'd never previously been elected to any office, and his campaign expenditures -- the Four Seasons, not the local Holiday Inn -- led me to believe that he was really running to qualify for federal matching funds. Nonetheless, established candidates like Sen. John Kerry and former Gov. Howard Dean tip-toed around him, as he stood on the same stage and was taken somewhat seriously. We've seen other self-promotional candidates, like Harold Stassen, run for president multiple times. We've seen "what the hell?" campaigns like that of former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel, as well as businessmen aiming for the ultimate executive office. In the 2012 campaign, Herman Cain occupies the self-promotional businessman slot quite capably. The former CEO of Godfather's Pizza and current conservative radio show host is the most able orator in the field and has fired up the enthusiasm of his supporters. But it's a long way from the boardroom to nuclear-code access, as Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan found out. Herman Cain will increase his fame, but he's not going to win the White House. Former Sen. Rick Santorum is running as the stalwart defender of social conservatives, but because of the near-ubiquity of those positions among his fellow candidates, he has not only failed to stand out from the pack, he has failed to make it clear what unique contribution his campaign makes to the debate. As a result, it seems as though Santorum is running primarily to keep his name alive, and finds the national spotlight more satisfying than risking another failed run in his native Pennsylvania. But the clearest example of the self-promotional approach to the presidency this campaign is Michele Bachmann. She absorbed a lot of media attention after the New Hampshire debate after exceeding expectations by side-stepping her steady stream of unhinged statements. These have included, for example, talking about how President Obama is "un-American" and bringing "tyranny" and "slavery" to the United States. Bachmann is using the $13.5 million she raised in donations last year from a national activist base to purchase a first-rate campaign team, helmed by longtime Republican strategist (and former CNN.com columnist) Ed Rollins. They can polish this quick study into serious-seeming candidate, but her record shows that she is fundamentally unserious and makes serially irresponsible statements. Bachmann practices the politics of incitement with heavy dose of the paranoid style. This can make an effectively inflammatory factional leader, but it is the opposite of the kind of unifying leader we look for in a president. For this reason, and many others, Bachmann won't be elected president. That she is being taken seriously by a segment of the conservative electorate -- and could possibly win a caucus like Iowa -- should concern responsible Republicans who want to win the White House. When six of the nine competitors for the GOP nomination are running to promote themselves or their ideas rather than to actually win the White House, the democratic process is degraded. It becomes infused with our reality TV driven culture, where people aim to be famous for being famous. No actual previous accomplishment is necessary. Only it's voters, rather than viewers, who are the ultimate losers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.

Colorado recall a proxy in national gun control debate
By Ashley Killough, CNN
updated 10:02 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two Colorado state senators face recall elections over state's new tougher gun laws
Gun rights activists nationwide see the election as a pivotal moment in the gun debate
Colorado has rich history of guns and is site of two of the worst mass shootings in the U.S.
(CNN) -- Sandy Phillips was a few days away from visiting her daughter, Jessie, an aspiring sports journalist, in Colorado. They exchanged text messages shortly after midnight on a Thursday, looking forward to the visit and talking about the new Batman movie Jessie was about to see.
They said goodnight, and Phillips tried going to sleep at her home in San Antonio.
Twenty minutes later she got a frantic phone call from Jessie's close friend, Brent, who was with her at the theater. He said there was a shooting, that he was shot twice.
"I said, 'Where's Jessie?'" Phillips recalls, before taking a short pause. "He said, 'I tried'."
Jessica Ghawi, 24, was one of 12 people shot to death in July 2012 at a theater in Aurora, Colorado. Fifty-eight people were wounded. For Phillips, sharing her painful but final memory of Jessie is an emotional endeavor. Her voice thins and grows shaky as she talks about that night.
But it's a challenge she has taken on dozens of times a day for the past week, going door to door in Colorado Springs as she asks voters to support a state lawmaker she never knew until this year: State Sen. John Morse.
As Senate president, Morse helped usher the passage of Colorado's restrictive new firearm laws. The state's deeply rooted gun rights establishment was not happy, and Morse is now one of two state senators on the ballot Tuesday in Colorado's first recall at the state level.
Gun rights activists nationwide see the election as a pivotal moment in the gun debate. If Morse and his Democratic colleague, state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo, are both ousted, some say it will send a cautionary message to other lawmakers: Mess with guns and this could happen to you.
The other side also views the recall as a potential turning point. If the senators win, it could signal a significant show of public support at the polls for regulations meant to curb gun violence. Gun control advocates also argue a victory would deal a major blow to what they consider the powerful voices that control the debate.
National groups on both ends of the spectrum, including the National Rifle Association and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the contests in what amounts to a proxy war over firearm regulations. At stake is a victory belt that can be used as leverage in future showdowns over the issue, either at the state level or in Washington.
Phillips and her husband, Lonnie, have been calling on 60 to 80 homes each day in Colorado for more than a week. While a number of conversations are short-lived, she shares her story with anyone willing to listen, hoping it will change minds.
"It's exhausting. You can only tell it so many times before you go to a very sad and dark place," she said. "But you take a break and have a good cry, pull your boot straps back up and head out again. We can't just sit quietly by."
A once-unlikely place for new gun laws
In March, Colorado became the second state after New York to put new gun laws on the books after the Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school shooting, which left 20 children and six adults dead.
Effective July 1, Colorado's new laws limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks on all gun purchases. Gun buyers, rather than sellers, must pay for their own background checks, a $10 fee.
The U.S. Senate tried passing similar laws earlier this year amid a highly charged national debate that rattled both sides of the issue. While most of the measures had little chance of survival, the Senate even fell short of the votes needed to proceed with what seemed to be the most viable piece of legislation: a bipartisan measure that would require background checks on firearms bought online and at gun shows.
Historically a conservative state, Colorado's political makeup has started to shift. It is one of three states in the West with a Democratic trifecta: The party holds both chambers of the legislature and the governor's office. While Colorado has trended blue in recent years, its blood runs red with a history rich in gun culture and tradition.
"Firearms are intertwined with the fabric of Colorado," said Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute, a Colorado conservative think tank. With the backing of 55 of the state's 62 elected sheriffs, Caldera's organization filed a lawsuit challenging the new laws.
As the home of two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history — Aurora and Columbine — Colorado has been a hot zone for the gun control debate. When state Senate committees held hearings one day over the gun measures in March, gun rights activists flooded the capitol in protest and drove around the building, honking horns for hours to cause a distraction. According to the Denver Post, a small plane flew overhead, carrying a floating message to the governor: Don't take our guns.
At the same time, lawmakers inside were also hearing from survivors and victims of gun violence, including former students at Columbine. Mark Kelly, husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, also testified about the shooting that seriously wounded his wife in the nearby state of Arizona.
By the end of the night, the two committees passed multiple gun control proposals. By the end of the month, Gov. John Hickenlooper signed the measures into law.
'We can't continue to bury our children'
Morse, the Senate president who helped lead the way in the gun control push, now finds himself campaigning against a recall effort mounted against him a little more than a year before the end of his second term in office. Term-limited, he can't run for re-election.
But he said he doesn't have any regrets in fighting for tighter gun laws. Asked why he advocated for new regulations in the face of fierce opposition, Morse pointed to the real catalyst of the renewed firearm debate.
"The vision of 6- and 7-year-olds in Newtown being carted out on stretchers, with their Power Rangers T-shirts now covered by a white sheet," he said. "We can't continue to bury our children."
It didn't take long for gun rights supporters to organize after the governor signed the gun package. With the help of the NRA, groups across the state attempted to gather signatures to recall a four state senators.
Activists, however, collected the required amount of signatures in only two districts, those represented by Morse and Giron. Morse's district is largely a swing district, with nearly four in 10 active voters being unaffiliated with a political party. Thirty-four percent are registered Democrats and 26% are registered Republicans. Giron's district has a larger Democratic presence.
Since the recall tactic was first used in Los Angeles in 1903, the effort has mostly been used at the municipal or local level, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Recalls are rarely successful for state lawmakers; attempts have led to elections only 38 times in more than a century, with 17 of those officials actually being booted out of office.
In Colorado, opponents of the recall argue the tactic is a troubling sign for democracy. If recalls evolve into successful political maneuvers, Morse said, then both sides will start to use it and "we'll end up with general election in even-numbered years and recalls in odd-numbered years."
"It will make governing even more difficult than it is," he said.
But supporters of the Colorado recall say the effort is a prime example of democracy at work.
"Democracy doesn't really live by a calendar," said Jennifer Kerns, a spokesperson for the group behind the recall effort against Morse. "It's up to the people when they want to rise up and do something like this."
Victory already declared
Giron didn't know much about guns when she was elected to office; she went to Denver to tackle other social and economic issues. When the debate exploded earlier this year, she decided to learn more about firearms. She held town halls, attended her first gun show and went to a shooting range with some friends.
She ultimately decided her district — and state — would be better off with laws that seek to keep guns out of "the hands of felons," she said, referring to the universal background check measure.
"This is not the wrong business to be fearful about doing the right thing," she added.
But a majority of Colorado voters disagree with Giron. According to a Quinnipiac University poll, 54% of voters oppose the new gun laws, compared to 40% who support them. At the same time, the poll indicates a majority don't believe Giron and Morse should be recalled for their votes. By a margin of 60%-31%, Colorado voters say people should wait for re-election rather than attempt a recall when they disagree with their representative.
Kevin Healey, a 34-year-old voter in Pueblo, illustrates how the gun control debate in Colorado transcends traditional political divides. A staunch Second Amendment defender, Healey describes himself as an independent who "leans very far to the left," except when it comes to gun rights issues.
Healey argued the effort to regulate guns to stop gun violence is a useless battle and lawmakers should be tackling mental health issues instead. "It's almost like fighting to the south when the problem is up north. It doesn't make any sense."
Healey signed a recall petition a few months ago to put Giron on the ballot—a decision, he said, that did not come easily.
"Pueblo is such a small town, it felt as if I was betraying someone behind her back," he said. Though he's never really met her, he sent her an e-mail explaining why he had to sign the petition.
But after "struggling for months," Healey has decided he's not going to vote against Giron on Tuesday after all. While he disagrees with her on gun rights, he disagrees with her Republican opponent in the recall on just about everything. Essentially, he sees it as picking the lesser of two bad options.
Still, Healey doesn't regret signing the original petition. No matter what the outcome, he thinks the recall sends a message to elected Democrats across the country that they can't "just take the Second Amendment lightly."
"It will make people think twice and be creative in legislating instead of doing something symbolic but completely useless," he said. "I'm sure her intention was genuine, but there has got to be more creative modes to stopping the violence."
Republican state Sen. Greg Brophy, who's running for governor and has been part of the campaign to oust his Democratic colleagues, believes supporters of the recall have already won, because they got the warning out. "The future of the Second Amendment will be decided in Colorado," he said.
He pointed to Giron's district, where Democrats make up nearly half the active electorate, while unaffiliated voters make up 29% and Republicans make up 23%.
"The fact that a Democratic state senator in a reliably Democratic seat, Pueblo, is either going to lose a recall or barely retain her office -- that's a victory either way," he said. "People in seats that aren't as reliably Democratic might want to be careful about advancing the gun control agenda. I see Tuesday as a win-win, or quite possibly, a win-no lose."
Not surprisingly, the two lawmakers whose names are on the ballot feel differently.
"The numbers are going to prove that in a state that had two of the largest tragedies in this country, it would have been a travesty not to address this issue," Giron said.
Morse brushed off the notion that the recall has already done its work for gun rights activists.
"They haven't won anything," he said. "And hopefully won't win anything."
