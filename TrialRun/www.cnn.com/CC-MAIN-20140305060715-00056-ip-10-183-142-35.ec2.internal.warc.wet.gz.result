Gustav changes but doesn't crash Republicans' partyStory Highlights Republican National Convention started Monday in scaled-back form Monday's emphasis was on providing relief for Gulf Coast states Hurricane Gustav is pushing convention coverage to the side Republicans could benefit from volunteer efforts Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO PHOTOS By Kristi Keck CNN	St. Paul, MINNESOTA (CNN) -- Convention-goers pushed politics aside Monday as Hurricane Gustav altered their plans from 1,000 miles away. The Republican National Convention scaled back its program after the uninvited guest forced them to shift focus to providing relief for areas affected by the storm. Instead of hard-hitting attacks from political heavyweights, Monday afternoon's program included a call to action from first lady Laura Bush and Cindy McCain, her potential successor. Bush introduced a video featuring a message from governors from the Gulf Coast states, and McCain pushed delegates to donate online. The night was a far cry from the hoopla of the Democrats' opening extravaganza. The gavel-to-gavel coverage of their first night included dancing delegates, a moving appearance by Sen. Edward Kennedy and a closing speech from Michelle Obama. "I know the delegates are disappointed. They come from all over the country to have this big celebration, but on the other hand, I know they understand," Laura Bush said. Watch the first lady's take on the convention » Although the Democrats' party included plenty of made-for-television moments, the Republicans' low-drama event hardly lends to bad press. Watch the low-key opening events » In less than an hour on Monday afternoon, the McCain camp's telethon efforts for hurricane relief brought in more than $1.1 million, including a hefty million-dollar donation from a private individual. The McCains have donated $25,000 dollars to Hurricane Gustav relief: $5,000 to each of the Gulf Coast states. Don't Miss Cindy McCain, Laura Bush express support
Republican Convention headquarters
The downtown phonebank included about 90 delegates, volunteers, campaign staff and others in the Twin Cities for the convention. "If Republicans gain some political leverage out of this, and they probably will, so be it: The test for each candidate is in part to show how well they adapt to changing circumstances," said David Gergen, a former presidential adviser and senior CNN political analyst. "The Obama-Biden team adapted extremely well to the challenges of their convention, and now it is the Republicans' turn at bat," he said. The theme of the first day, "Country First," was one of the few things that remained the same Monday. McCain's campaign displayed the theme on cards passed out to delegates. The flip side included information on relief agencies in Gulf Coast states. As far as the rest of the week's agenda, McCain's campaign said it would have to play it by ear. It was unclear whether politics would be back on the agenda, but volunteer efforts were on tap for the rest of the week. Organizers were planning to set up a volunteer center Tuesday inside the arena so convention-goers could assembly relief packs for send the hardest hit areas. Convention sponsors, who originally signed up for an event with an expected global audience, were also transforming their receptions into charitable events. "We've had companies call us today and say, what more can we do to help?" said Jeff Larson, CEO of the RNC host committee. Although the Grand Old Party might be a little subdued, Republicans are hopeful it will still be a grand affair.

Are people dying younger�from heart disease?Asked by P.J. Wallace, Los Angeles, California It seems more and more young people are dying of heart attacks/disease. When I was growing up (1960-70) a heart attack was an older person's disease. Today I'm hearing of people in their 30s and 40s dying. Is this my imagination? If not, why is this happening? Is it diet or stress? Conditions Expert
Dr. Otis Brawley
Chief Medical Officer,
American Cancer Society	Expert answer Dear P.J., You are not alone in your observation that it seems that so many people are having heart attacks. I went to the American Heart Association and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual statistics. It was incredibly enlightening: It turns out death rates actually are going down. The death category called cardiovascular disease includes mostly coronary artery disease, which causes heart attacks, and some blood vessel disease that causes stroke. This disease is due to atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of cholesterol plaque and blockage of the blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood to tissues. In the case of a heart attack, there is obstruction of coronary blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. Cardiovascular disease is the single leading cause of death in the U.S. and Western world. accounting for about one of every three deaths. In the U.S., more than 831,200 people died of cardiovascular disease in 2006. It is estimated that more than 17.6 million Americans have diagnosed cardiovascular heart disease. It is slightly more prevalent in men than women. Prevalence also increases with age. Despite these very significant numbers, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. declined by 29.2 percent from 1996 to 2006. In a slightly different, perhaps easier-to-understand statistic, the overall number of cardiovascular deaths in the U.S. went down by 12.9 percent from 1996 to 2006. The risk of death and number of people aged 40 to 60 dying of cardiovascular disease has been declining. The risk of death and number of deaths among people in their 30s has remained relatively stable. While overall deaths are declining, our ability to diagnose this disease early has increased and our ability to treat it has improved. Compared with 40 years ago, there are more people walking around with the diagnosis and getting treatment. Medications to treat high blood pressure, lower cholesterol and even treat diabetes are used to prevent cardiovascular disease from worsening. Increased awareness of the disease and the large number of people being treated for it may be the reason it seems more common. I must note that there is tremendous concern that the downward trend in death rate from cardiovascular disease is going to reverse in the near future. Major risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes are increasing in the U.S. and western Europe. The other significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease is cigarette smoking. Smoking rates are declining in some countries but increasing in others. There are significant increases in the number of young female smokers. The growing obesity epidemic is especially bad in the U.S. In the early 1970s, 15 percent of Americans were obese. By the year 2006, the obesity figure was 35 percent, and more than half of all American adults are obese or overweight. Among American teenagers, the proportion who are obese rose from 6 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 2006. Prevention of heart disease is far better than treating it. Most organizations recommend a healthy diet of five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day with limited amounts of lean meat. The CDC recommends adults get at least 2.5 hours of moderate physical activity per week (such as brisk walking) or at least 1.25 hours of vigorous activity per week combined with some muscle strengthening exercise.

A visit to Osama bin Laden's lair
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst
updated 7:37 AM EDT, Thu May 3, 2012
A local man walks through a field near Osama Bin Laden's compound, where he was killed during a raid by U.S. special forces a year ago.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen was only journalist to visit place where bin Laden lived -- and died
Bergen says the squalid compound seemed like a camping site
Bin Laden's room still contained medicines and hair dye he used
From this site, bin Laden composed memos in effort to control al Qaeda, Bergen says
Editor's note: Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst, is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden, From 9/11 to Abbottabad," from which this article is adapted.
(CNN) -- We climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Osama bin Laden died early in the morning of May 2, 2011. I stepped into the bedroom where he was killed and looked up at the ceiling, where you could still see the patterns of blood that had spurted from bin Laden's head when the bullet fired by a U.S. Navy SEAL tore through the terrorist leader's face.
The height of the room was low for someone as tall as bin Laden, who was 6 foot 4.
Outside the bedroom was a small terrace surrounded by a high wall. Overlooking the enclosed terrace were large and now broken plate glass windows that would have provided a lot of light for bin Laden during the day.
Peter Bergen
In the bedroom in which al-Qaeda's leader finally was killed, I had expected a frisson of something; perhaps a sensation like exploring Hitler's bunker complex beneath the streets of Berlin at the end of World War II.
Instead, I felt only a mild curiosity. On a shelf in bin Laden's bedroom was a box of Just For Men hair dye; in the final years of his life bin Laden dyed his hair and beard jet black to maintain a youthful appearance. I also noticed some medicines like ampicillin, ibuprofen, Nestle energy glucose strips, Amplicox (a penicillin) and Spasler P syrup, which has an antispasmodic effect on the muscles of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.
I examined bin Laden's tiny bathroom, about the size of a closet, and noticed that he used a toilet that was really only a hole in the floor over which he had to squat to do his business. It's not the image that one usually associates with the world's most wanted man.
Exclusive access to bin Laden's compound
Bin Laden documents revealed
How Amanpour knew where bin Laden was
Obama tells the troops 'thank you' Next door to the bedroom, which he shared with his much younger Yemeni wife, was bin Laden's study. Crude bookshelves lined the walls and another large window overlooked the enclosed terrace. It was here that bin Laden composed often mammoth memos to his key lieutenants as he sought to maintain some measure of control over his organization, which was now under intense assault by the United States and its allies. Some of these memos are being released on Thursday by West Point.
* * *
In February I secured permission to enter Osama bin Laden's compound in the northern Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where he was killed and where he had lived for the last half-decade of his life; the first, and only, journalist to do so.
I was escorted by officers of Pakistan's military intelligence agency, ISI, past checkpoints manned by armed soldiers who were there to dissuade the merely curious from approaching the compound.
Arriving at the front gate of the bin Laden residence, we were joined by a Pakistani Army captain wearing a sidearm. He would be our escort. I had been instructed "no photographs." Clearly, this rule would be enforced were it to become necessary.
We entered through the main metal gate of the compound, which opened onto an internal narrow street with high walls on both sides. We then turned right into a small field, around a third of an acre in size, where the residents of the compound grew crops. This field was enclosed by the compound's walls on three sides, and on one of the sides there was a small storage shack for the harvested crops.
I could see burn marks on one of the outer walls of the compound where the tail rotor of a helicopter had clipped the wall and broken off. It was the stealth Black Hawk helicopter that had developed mechanical problems during the U.S. Navy SEAL raid that killed bin Laden. There were also burn marks in the field where the downed chopper was subsequently blown up by the SEALs as the raid was ending.
On the other side of the compound were concrete feeding pens where the residents kept cows. Beyond that was a large garden where they grew vegetables such as cucumbers. In the vegetable garden there was a small "hujra" structure that functioned as a sitting room and that was littered with cardboard boxes for computer equipment.
The bin Ladens also kept honeybees and rabbits. On the ground there were scattered cartons of Quaker Oats and large empty cans of Sasso olive oil.
On one side of the compound was a self-contained, walled-off annex area. This is where bin Laden's trusted courier, Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, lived with his wife and four children. In this annex area was a simple garage where bin Laden's courier parked his white jeep and red van.
Inside the courier's one-story house, all the rooms were small and simple. They consisted of a washroom with a shower, a kitchen, a bedroom and a storage room. Children's toys were scattered around the floors of this building and children's bikes were parked in the storage area. There were medicine bottles and cough syrup on shelves in the bathroom and a calendar in the kitchen that marked Ramadan eating and prayer times.

On the night of the raid, Pakistani officials found the courier's body lying just outside his bedroom and behind a locked grey door with windows that had been shot out. The courier was killed with two bullets to the chin and his wife, Mariam, was shot and wounded.
The Pakistani intelligence official guiding me through the compound said there were no AK-47 bullets found at the scene and he therefore surmised that the courier had been taken by surprise and was shot before he could reach for his AK-47, which was recovered leaning against the wall of the Kuwaitis' bedroom.
Leaving this annex area we passed through a metal door in an internal compound wall and came into a pleasant lawn area, in the middle of which was a small structure that was used by the residents as a sun room. Next to this was a water tank and a bread oven. Dominating the lawn was the three-story house in which bin Laden lived with his three wives and a dozen of his children and grandchildren.
We entered the front door of the house. On the right was a study and on the left a bedroom. On the door of this room I saw graffiti, which turned out to be verses of the Quran.
It was in this room where, after the raid, Pakistani officials found the courier's brother and his wife, both shot dead. Officials also found about a dozen children with their hands tied together in this ground floor bedroom.
Deeper into the house was a kitchen and two sizable storage rooms. At the back end of the ground floor was a room where the bin Laden family would watch the sole TV in the compound. In this room was a gas heater that had an improvised exhaust system attached to it made from bits of sheet metal hammered together.
At the back of the house was the stairwell. Blocking the way up the stairs was a massive yellow iron metal door that sealed off access to the upper two floors of the house. This gate had large blast marks on it where the SEALs forced their way through as they closed in on bin Laden.
Halfway between the ground floor and the second floor, Pakistani officials found the body of Khalid bin Laden, bin Laden's 23-year-old son, who was shot and killed by the SEALs on the staircase.
The SEALs shot to kill or wound most of the adults they encountered in the compound, killing four men, one woman and wounding two other women. Of the 11 adults on the compound (which included three of bin Laden's adult children: Khalid, 23, Mariam, 20, and Summiya,18) they shot seven of them. They did not shoot at bin Laden's two older wives.
On the second floor of the compound were rooms for the older wives and for his various children and grandchildren. Their beds were made from plywood boards hammered together. As on the previous floor, there was an improvised system of metal pipes to remove the exhaust from a gas heater. In the kitchen of each wife's area there was a similar improvised exhaust system made from sheet metal to expel kitchen smells. The overall effect of all this was of a long-term but makeshift camping site and the overwhelming impression I had was one of squalor.
Medicines for indigestion and other ailments littered the floor and there was a large amount of broken glass everywhere, testament to the intensity of the SEAL assault on the compound.
This second floor had a terrace from which there was a lovely view of snow-capped mountains. From this terrace one could look down to an area where a guard dog was once tied and there was a coop for chickens. In the area where the chickens were kept I noticed several computer keyboards strewn about, presumably left there as the SEALs hurriedly carted off much of bin Laden's computer equipment.
The image we have of bin Laden in his final years in Abbottabad is of an aging man with a graying beard watching old footage of himself; just another suburban dad flipping though the channels with his remote. And in the end, bin Laden died in a squalid suburban compound surrounded by his wives and children and far from the front lines of his holy war.

Why we should look to the Arctic
By Bob Reiss, Special to CNN
updated 1:17 PM EDT, Mon July 16, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Shell is planning to drill 70 miles north of Alaska to see whether 27 billion barrels of oil are there
Bob Reiss: For America, the stakes are huge in the Arctic He says opening of the region could cheapen price of gas and products from Asia
Reiss: If you want the U.S. to remain strong and dominant in the world, look to the north
Editor's note: Bob Reiss, a former reporter at the Chicago Tribune, is the author of 18 books, including the just published, "The Eskimo and the Oil Man." He can be seen this week on CNN as part of the "Erin Burnett OutFront" series on the Arctic at 7 pm ET. (CNN) -- Most Americans think of the Arctic as an icy, distant place; beautiful, remote and teeming with wildlife, but unrelated to their daily lives. Nothing could be further from the truth.
This summer, big doings on America's northern doorstep will have enormous consequences to the economic, strategic and environmental future of the nation. Yet we are unprepared for the challenges and opportunities.
What happens in the Arctic as ice melts there could soon cheapen the cost of the gas you buy and products you purchase from Asia. It could help make the nation more energy independent. It could draw our leaders into a conflict over undersea territory. It is already challenging Washington to protect millions of square miles filled with some of the most magnificent wildlife on Earth, and native people whose culture and way of life is at risk as a squall line of development sweeps across the once inaccessible top of the planet.
Opinion: It's time to develop our Arctic resources
Bob Reiss
For America, the stakes are huge: A chance to gain wealth and global influence in the newest geopolitical playing field, but there is also potential environmental and security disaster if looming challenges are mishandled or ignored.
If that sounds farfetched, consider the following:
-- Shell is poised to sink exploratory wells -- temporary ones drilled from ships -- 70 miles north of Alaska in a few weeks. The operation will assess whether an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil is there. This is roughly three times the amount that has been extracted from the Gulf of Mexico over the past 20 years.
Cold Wars: Battle for Arctic oil
Shell Oil ship slips anchor; incident raises questions about Arctic drilling plan
Proponents believe a discovery would cut America's dependence on foreign oil and provide jobs and needed revenue to the Treasury Department. They say the oil could be extracted safely. Opponents fear a spill would be a disaster, being difficult to clean up in icy seas. More oil companies wait in the wings and also own offshore leases.
-- In Washington, politicians are jockeying over whether to ratify "The Law of the Sea Treaty," under which countries abutting oceans will be able to claim up to 200 extra miles of undersea territory if they can prove it an extension of their continental shelves. For the U.S., that could mean extra territory the size of California off Alaska.
President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush support the treaty, as does an oddly aligned group including the Pentagon, Sierra Club, oil companies, shipping companies and environmentalists, who favor the part of the treaty designed to help protect the world's oceans. Although every other Arctic country has ratified the treaty, in the U.S. it has been blocked for years by conservative senators who fear that it gives too much influence to multinational bodies.
-- An undersea land rush has started under the treaty, with Russia claiming an area the size of France and Spain combined. Norway's claim has been granted, and other Arctic nations preparing to file claims. One U.S. Coast Guard admiral, speaking of the treaty, told me, "If this was a ball game, the U.S. wouldn't be on the field, in the stadium or even in the parking lot. We're last in this race."
-- The Russian military has identified the Arctic as one of the likely places for conflict to erupt in the 21st century over resources. Even if actual combat never occurs, whoever controls the high north will wield enormous influence in the coming decades.
Russia has 18 working icebreakers. The U.S. has one. Russia is opening their Arctic sea lanes to commercial shipping. The U.S. has no permanent Coast Guard or Naval presence yet in the high north, although both branches of the service are preparing to move north.
Naval war games last fall anticipated security challenges in the near future: how to deal with terrorists in the Arctic, how to deal with a rogue ship carrying nuclear weapons in the Arctic, how to move a U.S. fleet around the top of the planet, how to help clean up an oil spill. Gamers concluded the Navy needs to prepare and needs more resources.
-- The Northwest Passage is the long-dreamed-of, formerly iced-over sea route between Europe and Asia. This route around the top of Canada and Alaska has killed hundreds of sailors and explorers for centuries, locking their ships in ice, starving them, freezing them, driving them insane and causing survivors to eat each other.
Yet in summers, that passage is now so clear that tourist ships routinely sail through it. Even private yachts make the trip. It is expected that commercial shipping will follow. That's because a single Chinese container ship sailing the Northwest Passage between Shanghai and New York instead of using the Panama Canal would save an estimated $2 million each way on gas and tolls.
In short, the region is opening.
For the past three years, I've spent much time in northern Alaska researching for my book, "The Eskimo and the Oil Man." It's about the grand challenges facing the world there, as seen through the eyes of an Inupiat Eskimo leader who is a grandfather and whale hunter, and the Shell executive sent to drill for oil off Alaska's North Slope.
I sailed on the only U.S. icebreaker for six weeks, sat in on meetings at the Senate over the Arctic, attended a naval war game and met regularly with other oil executives and Inupiat leaders, whale hunters and families on the North Slope. That 4,000-year-old culture sits at the border between wise development and environmental anarchy, and the people of America's polar county will soon watch with hope and fear as the oil ships move north.
Their concerns are not just local ones but should engage every American. If you care about the environment, if you care about gas prices, if you care about where our soldiers and navy may serve next, if you want the U.S. to remain strong and dominant in the world, look to the north this summer.
Look to the Arctic. That's where much of our common future is about to play out.

Obama poster artist gets probation for evidence tampering
By Leigh Remizowski, CNN
updated 5:31 PM EDT, Fri September 7, 2012
Artist Shepard Fairey stands in front of his image of U.S. President Barack Obama on January 17, 2009. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Shepard Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court in February
He also was ordered on Friday to pay $25,000 in fines in a dispute that dates to 2009 In his civil complaint, Fairey claimed to have used a photo of Obama and George Clooney
New York (CNN) -- The street artist who created the iconic red, white and blue Obama "Hope" posters in the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election was sentenced Friday to two years' probation after tampering with evidence, prosecutors said.
Shepard Fairey pleaded guilty in February to criminal contempt of court for falsifying and destroying documents and coaching a witness while embroiled in a copyright infringement battle over his use of a now-famous image by The Associated Press that featured then-Sen. Barack Obama.
Fairey was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines in a dispute that dates back to 2009, when he brought a federal lawsuit against AP, claiming that he was entitled to use the image under the fair use doctrine, according to a statement by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
The guidelines are a copyright exception allowing reproductions in specific instances of news reporting, commentary, teaching and other situations.
"I accept full responsibility for violating the court's trust by tampering with evidence during my civil case with (The) Associated Press, which, after my admitting to engaging in this conduct, led to this criminal case by the Southern District of New York," Fairey said in a written statement. "I accept the judge's sentence and look forward to finally putting this episode behind me."
Federal prosecutors said Fairey, 42, lied about which AP image of Obama he used as inspiration for the posters, which were stamped with the words "Hope" and "Progress."
"After spending a great amount of time, energy and legal effort, all of us at The Associated Press are glad this matter is finally behind us," said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. "We hope this case will serve as a clear reminder to all of the importance of fair compensation for those who gather and produce original news content."
In his civil complaint, Fairey claimed to have used a photo taken of Obama and actor George Clooney by an AP photographer in 2006, though he actually used a different AP image -- a close-up of the current president, prosecutors said.
The federal court found Fairey had both destroyed documents that would prove that he had not used the photo of Obama and Clooney, and created false ones in an attempt to back the claims he made in his complaint.
"My wrong-headed actions, born out of a moment of fear and embarrassment, have not only been financially and psychologically costly to myself and my family, but also helped to obscure what I was fighting for in the first place -- the ability of artists everywhere to be inspired and freely create art without reprisal," Fairey said.
According to court documents, Fairey and AP settled the civil suit in January 2011 for $1.6 million.

Howser grew up in Tennessee, graduated from the University of Tennessee, worked on a U.S. senator's staff and served in the U.S. Marine Corps, according to a biography posted on his company website. He then launched his television career at WSM in Nashville.
He moved on to a job hosting a magazine-style TV series at WCBS in New York before landing in Los Angeles in 1981 as a reporter for KCBS.
Six years later, Howser joined forces with KCET, a public television station, to produce a program known as "Videolog" showcasing the stories of all types of people.
That led to "California's Gold" and six other series about life in the Golden State, including "Visiting with Huell Howser," "Road Trip with Huell Howser," "California's Golden Parks," "California's Green," "California's Water" and "Downtown." In addition to California, his shows could be seen in Oregon, Nevada and Tennessee.
Less than 20 minutes after KCET posted news of Howser's death on its Facebook page, more than 150 fans had posted responses mourning his loss and remembering his impact on California and their lives.
They remembered him as "amazing," a "favorite" and "one-of-a-kind talent" who also possessed a "kind curiosity."
One man said that news of Howser's death "brought tears to my eyes like I lost a friend," and another remarked that "Sunday evenings will not be the same."
"So I guess God needed a host for 'Heaven's Gold,'" wrote another Facebook commenter. "We will miss you, but you will live on ... and on."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fauja Singh was the first 100-year-old to ever run a marathon
Now 102, he has quit competitive racing but still runs every day
He took up athletics after overcoming the loss of his wife and son
Born in India, he has made Britain his home since the 1990s
CNN's Human to Hero series celebrates inspiration and achievement in sport. Click here for videos and features.
(CNN) -- At an age when most pensioners are winding down their lives, Fauja Singh began a new one.
In his late 80s, and feeling "more dead than alive" following the loss of his wife and one of his sons, he took up marathon running.
Now 102, he has become an unlikely celebrity despite a birth defect that prevented him being able to walk until the age of five.
"Running showed me kindness and brought me back to life by making me forget all my traumas and sorrows," he told CNN's Human to Hero series.
"When I took up running, it was like meeting God himself. I have been running ever since."
With his distinctive flowing grey beard and the traditional Sikh headgear that has earned him the nickname "the Turbaned Tornado," Singh has been a star entrant at marathons all over the world.
It is a far cry from his humble upbringing in India, which despite its village tranquillity was also a test for the young Singh -- who was unable to walk until he was five due to weakness in his legs.
"It took me another five years to gain strength and become strong. By age 10 I was living a normal life," he recalls.

While many older people suffer bodily deterioration, Singh said tests done when he was 94 showed his left leg had the bone density of a 35-year-old and his right leg that of a 25-year-old.
"My response was, I knew my left leg was weak," he smiles. As he says later: "Life is a waste without humor -- living is all about happiness and laughter."
More medical tests done when he was 99 "showed that I was a man of 40 years of age."
Singh grew up in a village in the Jalandhar district of the north-western Punjab state along with his four brothers and sisters and their parents.
"One doesn't know about life's complexities at that age. Whatever means one has always seems to be enough," he said. "Life was good because we had land and animals ... there was no stress."
Singh now lives in London, the UK's bustling capital city, having finally made it his home in the 1990s after several trips to Britain.

"After my wife died and when I suffered another tragedy -- the loss of my son -- I came here for two years but I didn't like it as my mind was still in India. Eventually I had to come to terms with it," he said.
"Then I took up running -- eventually I was able to overcome my sadness."
Singh started out competing over shorter distances -- from 100 meters up -- but was convinced to try for the 26 miles and 385 yards that makes up a marathon.

"I had run a 20K but I couldn't tell the difference between a kilometer and a mile -- I thought I had done 20 miles so I thought I could do the other six quite easily," he said.
"Then I met Harmander (Singh, his longtime coach and mentor), he trained me in a couple of months to run the full distance -- and then I was 89 years old."
Singh's fastest time is the five hours and 40 minutes he took to run the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon at the age of 92. Eight years later he returned to the Canadian event to become the first marathon centenarian, this time clocking more than eight hours.

It was not accepted by Guinness World Records' rule-keepers due to his lack of a birth certificate, although he did produce a letter from Britain's Queen Elizabeth congratulating him on his 100th birthday.
Just days earlier he had set five world records for his age group in the space of a few hours in events from 100m to 5,000m at a Masters meeting in Toronto.
As well as soothing his soul, running has also brought Singh unexpected fame -- he appeared in an Adidas advertising campaign along with soccer superstar David Beckham and boxing legend Muhammad Ali in 2004.
"I was really, really happy as I didn't even know who these people were before that," he said.
Most of Singh's marathons were charity fundraisers, in line with his Sikh beliefs.
"There are two noble things in life: one to do charity and other to look after your body," he said.
"This includes the high principles outlined by my religion, to earn an honest living and to share your means with those less fortunate.

"I am inspired by honest people who don't cheat others. To me the famous are those who are kind to fellow human beings and dedicate their life to charity."

And it is religion that helps him keep going when he hits the dreaded "wall" during a race -- he experiences the transcendental effect of such exercise that was so eloquently documented by Japanese author Haruki Murakami in his book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running."
"The first part of the run is when I am quite cheerful; my heart is singing a song and dancing seeing the different colors of life," Singh said.
"When I get really tired, I start chanting God's name: 'Waheguru, Waheguru.'
"Running also makes people more spiritually aware and in-tune with their inner self. A retired marathon runner will still retain all these qualities."
And having become the world's oldest marathon runner, Singh is indeed now retired.
His final race was the 10-kilometer event ahead of February's Hong Kong marathon, after which he took the advice of his family and Harmander Singh.
"I have retired because given my age, my body has deteriorated a bit, but retirement hasn't slowed me down," he said.
"I lead a very active and healthy life. I walk for three to four hours a day, play with kids and do all my day-to-day chores myself. I might have continued to run for another year but I realized I had to eventually retire one day."

A strict vegetarian (he appeared in a campaign by animal rights group PETA) Singh describes himself as "an illiterate person" -- this interview was translated from Punjabi with the help of his coach.
While he lives a simple life -- in bed by 10 p.m. after relaxing listening to Punjabi radio, and up again by 6 a.m. -- he does admit to one guilty pleasure: shopping.
"Though I am an old man now, I am still very particular about my personal style. I love shopping for suits and shoes -- I keep looking for the latest and best available," Singh said.
"I don't have many expenses but I do spend often on new suits and shoes even though I have a lot of them."
Running shoes, in particular, remind him of the happiness he has discovered.
"I am very fond of my running shoes, I absolutely love them. I wear them for pleasure. I can't imagine my life without them."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Walker's charity will get part of proceeds from "Fast & Furious 6's" home entertainment sales
The actor died while supporting his organization, Reach Out Worldwide
The family has asked that others donate to the charity in lieu of flowers
(CNN) -- "Fast & Furious 6" studio Universal is doing its part to honor Paul Walker's memory.
After the actor's death in a fiery car wreck Saturday, the studio has pledged to give a percentage of the proceeds from the home entertainment sales of "Fast & Furious 6" to Walker's charity, Reach Out WorldWide.
The 40-year-old founded the organization, which works with local experts to provide disaster relief, in January 2010, after Haiti was devastated by an earthquake.
On the day of his death, Walker was attending a holiday toy drive for the organization.
"With the passing of Paul, the world has lost a man who spent a great deal of his life in service to others," the chairman of Universal Pictures, Donna Langley, said in a statement Tuesday. "We share in the deep grief of his family, friends and the countless fans who love him. We keep Paul's memory alive and honor his legacy through continued support of Reach Out WorldWide, the non-profit he founded to give hope to those who must rebuild after they have experienced natural disasters."
"Fast & Furious 6" was a juggernaut at the box office when it was released in May, and went on to earn $238 million domestically and $788 million worldwide. The DVD and Blu-ray will be released on December 10.
Walker's family has requested that grieving fans and friends donate to Reach Out WorldWide in lieu of sending flowers. "It's comforting for them to know that the son, brother, and father they love so much is equally adored, respected, and appreciated by so many," the actor's family said in a statement. "Paul founded the organization with the genuine desire to help others, and it's important to his family to keep his memory alive through ROWW."
The seventh installment of Universal's blockbuster "Fast" franchise was in the works at the time of Walker's death, and it's still unclear what will become of the project, which is scheduled to bow in July 2014.
In the meantime, Walker's "Fast & Furious" co-stars are trying to cope with a stunning loss.
Jordana Brewster, who worked closely with Walker in a number of the "Fast" films, said in a statement that Walker "was an enormous presence in my life for the past fourteen years."
As others have, Brewster made it a point to note Walker's generous spirit. "While many would be satisfied with material success it made Paul more convinced of the need to help others," the 33-year-old star said. "He never spoke of his immense generosity or philanthropic endeavors unless I prodded, however. This is what made Paul, Paul. He lived with integrity, humanity and humility and seemed most happy when talking about his daughter, Meadow. I don't know anyone who lived each moment more fully and loved life more than Paul; making his loss all the more heartbreaking."
Brewster's comment is part of an incredible outpouring of messages from people in the entertainment industry. After news of his death spread, even those who said they didn't know Walker well acknowledged that they'd heard about his kindness.
Michelle Rodriguez, another actress who's worked with Walker, tweeted on December 2 that she's "gonna carry this torch for you brother, with a forced smile on my face and Im gonna open my heart just cause your telling me to."
Other "Fast" stars, like Tyrese Gibson and Vin Diesel, have joined fans in mourning at the crash site. Gibson has shared what he calls words of healing with fans, and Diesel posted a farewell message to Walker on his Facebook page.
"Pablo, I wish you could see the world right now... and the profound impact, your full life has had on it, on Us... on me," he wrote. "I will always love you Brian, as the brother you were... on and off screen."
