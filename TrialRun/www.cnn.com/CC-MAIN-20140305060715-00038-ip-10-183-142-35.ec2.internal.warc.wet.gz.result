The coming-out stories of anonymous bloggersStory Highlights Formerly anonymous bloggers share their coming-out stories with CNN The writers can be forced to give up their identities by courts or technology Earlier this week, a judge ordered Google to give over the identity of a blogger Another outed blogger says she was fired for her online opinionsNext Article in Technology » By John D. Sutter CNN	(CNN) -- Blog fans in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, saw PittGirl as their masked superhero -- a comedian and local commentator who jibed the mayor without reserve and ranted freely about her hatred of pigeons. Virginia Montanez says she was fired because she revealed her identity as a local blogger. But despite her effort to keep her real name secret, people started to figure out who PittGirl was. Feeling pressure to take control of her identity before someone else outed her, PittGirl on Wednesday posted pictures of herself on her blog and introduced readers to her real-world self: Virginia Montanez, a 35-year-old married mother of two who worked in the nonprofit sector. "My friends and family call me Ginny," she wrote on her blog. "But you can continue to call me Your Majesty, because I've grown accustomed." On Thursday morning, Montanez was fired from her job because of her online persona, she said. Montanez's and other online coming-out stories highlight the complicated way people view anonymity on the Internet and the high stakes that come with trying to keep up an online persona. The reasons people want to be anonymous online vary. Political whistle blowers fear retribution; employees want to separate the personal from the professional; artists want their work to stand up without an attached biography; and some writers like Montanez take on a sort of Everyman quality by keeping their real names off their posts. Don't Miss Ruling could let model find, sue online heckler
But there also are reasons why a person with an online persona might want to come out of the closet. Some anonymous bloggers, like PittGirl, worry their veils of anonymity will be pulled back against their will, and plenty of news events validate their fears. Earlier this week, for example, a New York Supreme Court judge forced Google to reveal the identity of a blogger who had been posting rants about onetime cover girl Liskula Cohen on Blogger.com, which Google owns. No true anonymity That case, and similar ones before it, send the message that the cloak of online anonymity easily can be lifted, said Judith Donath, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. But it's difficult to say whether the Web is becoming more or less anonymous, she said. "What's increasing is the range of forums and the types of anonymous environments people have to choose among," she said. Some sites, like Facebook, encourage people to give lots of information about their real-world selves. Blogs are more of a mixed bag, she said, where many people write under assumed names or put their words in the mouths of invented characters. But such split identities can easily be merged -- either through the judicial process or by using technology. Courts have set general guidelines that a plaintiff must meet before forcing a person out of online anonymity. But the rules are still in the making and are up for interpretation, said Daniel Solove, a law professor at the George Washington University Law School and author of "The Future of Reputation." On one end of the spectrum, a court could out a blogger simply because a legal action is filed against the person. That's troublesome because any good attorney could leverage the courts simply to expose a person's identity, he said. At the other extreme, a judge could say a plaintiff must prove the blogger defamed someone before forcing a company like Google to reveal the person's identity. Technology also can be used to unmask someone. Matt Zimmerman, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for the rights of anonymous speech, said there are tools people can use to try to hide their footprints online. But none is 100 percent effective, he said. That leaves some online writers who use pseudonyms in the stressful situation of not knowing if or when their real names will be revealed. Blogging waiter wants publicity For Steve Dublanica, a New York City waiter who ragged on his customers for years through a blog called Waiter Rant, the tension of being outed gnawed at his stomach like a bad cheeseburger. Dublanica said his boss and co-workers knew of his blog. But as his site got more and more popular, people started having contests to figure out who he was. He valued his secrecy because he says it afforded him creative freedom and access to good material. "If [the customers] know you're going to write down what they're saying or what they're doing they tend to act differently," he said. Dublanica didn't out himself because of the stress of keeping the secret, though. He got a book deal. And he wanted the publicity and recognition that came with it. "The nice thing about not being anonymous is I can take credit for all the work I do," he said. "The bad stuff ... was that it was terrifying in the beginning. You just didn't know how people were going to treat you." Alaska blogger outed by politician Jeanne Devon, a 43-year-old political blogger in Alaska, had her identity revealed after a state legislator published her name in a newsletter. Devon, who blogs on a site called The Mudflats, says she has mixed feeling about being forced out of the closet. In one sense, she says, she was able to be more herself while writing under an assumed name. "There are things that you know, or that you feel sort of in your heart of hearts, that you might not want to put out there in a public way" with your name attached, she said. "If people always spoke without filters, we'd learn a lot more." She also says she has felt more support from her readers and her community since her real name was published. Some bloggers who post under their real names say that those who write under pseudonyms have something to hide or don't want to be held accountable to their audiences. Getting 'dooced' Heather B. Armstrong, who was fired from her job after her employer discovered her blog, Dooce, where she posted under her real name, said there are few valid reasons a blogger should veil his or her identity. "I think if you're doing something anonymously you've got some issues going on," she said. "There's a reason that you're hiding." People now use the term "dooced" to refer to being fired because of a personal blog. Armstrong, who writes about her family, says she's received all kinds of hate mail -- from people who call her kids ugly to those who tell her she's an unfit mother and should have her children taken away from her. Being honest about her identity has helped Armstrong get through those criticisms and through other hard times. "I credit my audience with saving my life back when I had postpartum depression because of all of the encouraging e-mails they sent me," she said. "The good far, far, far outweighs the bad, and my life has been incredibly enriched through the Internet." Hero unmasked Montanez, the fired blogger in Pittsburgh, said she's trying to find an upside in what's happened to her. Her former employer, the Negro Educational Emergency Drive, did not respond to CNN requests for comment. She doesn't like the idea of being in the public eye. She describes herself as shy and said part of the reason she wanted to remain anonymous was so she wouldn't draw attention to herself. She also feels like her larger-than-life persona has been somewhat deflated now that readers know who she is. But now that she's out, she figures she might as well try to capitalize on her newfound openness. "I just want to write and get paid for it," she said.

Rapture, Indiana, not sweating predicted Day of Judgment By Phil Gast, CNN Musician, former lawyer and atheist David Tanner is the only resident of the community once called Rapture, Indiana. STORY HIGHLIGHTSRapture, Indiana, is in farm country a half-hour northwest of EvansvilleIt's not clear how it got its nameA radio network has predicted that Judgment Day will begin Saturday (CNN) -- If the Day of Judgment begins Saturday, as an apocalyptic Christian radio network has predicted, the community of Rapture, Indiana, will likely take it in stride. Perhaps that's because the souls who lived in 15 to 20 homes in the southwest corner of the state are long gone -- leaving only one family and the name Rapture on online maps. Curious about its history, CNN called area post offices, the town hall in nearby Poseyville and the local library. Nobody had heard of Rapture, much less knew how it got its name. But they did know of Bugtown, as the tiny community on Highway 68 is now known. Heather Gallagher, director of Poseyville Carnegie Public Library, did a little digging and suggested a call to Bugtown's sole resident, who splits his time between Indiana and Nashville. David Tanner gave up his law practice and moved to Nashville, where he plays upright bass and sings in groups Spaghetti Westerneers and Brazilbilly. Doomsday prophecy: What if he's right?
Ready for end of the world?

He owns a home, rental property and an airplane hangar in Bugtown. "The rest is grass," said Tanner. An atheist, Tanner is not fretting about Family Radio founder Harold Camping's prediction that Jesus Christ will return during the world's destruction and ascend into heaven with true believers. I'm not concerned if the world doesn't end and it's all a hoax," Tanner said from Nashville Friday. "If it does (end), I've had a great time living to 46." In nearby Griffin, Guy Carner, 77, said he is familiar with Bugtown. "It's a dot in the road." He, too, was philosophical about Saturday's predicted Rapture. "I think the Bible says you never know when it will happen." Tanner, whose Indiana home is 150 years old, said old-timers at some point began referring to Rapture as Bugtown. "We'll never know exactly where the name came from," he said of Rapture. He does have a idea on why the area is called Bugtown. "She said there was a lot of bugs," the musician said, quoting his grandmother. For several years, Tanner has held the Bugtown Jamboree the Sunday before Labor Day. Bluegrass and other musicians play. The event has included a square dance, two parachutists and a helicopter. All for a $10 donation. Tanner's not sure if he'll pull it together this year. "It's a lot of beer bottles to pick up." Saturday, meanwhile, should be pretty quiet in the Indiana farm country, with highs in the low 80s, but scattered thunderstorms in Poseyville are possible. The Poseyville library is planning to open at 9 a.m. Come rain or Rapture, postal carriers will deliver mail, said Postmaster Cecilia Luebke in nearby New Harmony. "Absolutely," she said.

Katt Williams: 'I'm kinda done' with stand-up comedy career
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 9:37 AM EST, Wed December 5, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Williams tells Seattle TV station KOMO he's retiring from stand-up comedy
Seattle police charge Williams with assault, harassment and obstruction Sunday
Williams first gained attention as a stand-up comic in 1999
(CNN) -- Katt Williams announced the end of his stand-up comedy career Monday, a day after a bizarre incident in Seattle that landed him in jail.
"I'm just going to go ahead and announce my retirement from stand-up," he told a photographer for Seattle TV station KOMO Monday night. "I'm kinda done."
Williams was in Seattle to perform over the weekend, but his allegedly aggressive behavior at a Seattle bar and an odd exchange with police ended with him in the King County, Washington, jail Sunday on charges of assault, harassment and obstruction. He was released on bond Monday morning, a jail official said.
He was also involved in incidents in Sacramento and Oakland during comedy tour stops in California in the past month.
KOMO aired an interview with Williams that is said was recorded on a street after he was ejected from a south Lake Union hotel Monday evening.

Williams: I'm not anti-Mexican
"I've already discussed it with my kids," Williams said. "I wasn't really going to do it on a Seattle street. I was going to Los Angeles and do it in the offices of ICM or LiveNation." ICM is a talent agency, and LiveNation is a concert promotion company.
Williams told the station he would remain in Seattle until a Thursday court date on the criminal charges and while he files a lawsuit against the city "for this $50 million that I want for crippling my reputation as a father and a black man and as a taxpaying citizen and as a person who is not a convicted felon."
Williams "exchanged words with patrons in the bar, brandished a pool cue at a bar manager and refused to leave the business," and later refused to show identification to a police officer who had been called to the scene, a Seattle police news release said.
Officer Michael Virgilio wrote in the arrest report that the World Sports Bar manager told him Williams had returned to the bar Sunday after being involved in a dispute with a customer the night before.
"I suppose you're going to ask me to take my hands out of my pockets, huh?" Williams said to Virgilio, according to the report.
Williams refused to give his name or show an ID, but "yelled out a (California) driver's license number," the officer wrote.
When Virgilio warned he would arrest him for obstruction unless he produced an ID, Williams said "no." The comedian then turned around and placed his hands behind his back "on his own accord," the arrest report said.
"Two of Williams' associates were standing nearby and were pleading for Williams to calm down," the officer wrote.
While being handcuffed and searched, Williams "made several comments about how he was going to sue the department," the report said.
"He stated he had been arrested over 30 times in the last few months and every time he was released prior to being booked into jail," Virgilio wrote. "He made comments regarding my employment with the city of Seattle and how it would end as a result of his arrest. Williams stated he had millions of dollars, and this arrest would not affect him."
After the search turned up Williams' passport in his pocket, the officer asked why he hadn't just handed it over.
"You asked for my driver's license," he quoted Williams saying. "I didn't have it!"
Then, it got worse, the arrest report said.
"Williams became aggressive and resistant and his actions forced me to take him to the ground for a short period of time. He was subsequently placed in the back of my patrol car."
Williams was playing pool in the bar when Sunday's trouble started, the report said. "An argument began and quickly escalated."
When the manager tried to separate Williams from the couple with whom he was arguing, Williams yelled at him for "protecting the customers from the famous guy," Virgilio wrote.
"Williams picked up a pool stick, raised it up and pointed it at (the manager's) face," the report said. "(The manager) continued to state if he hadn't stepped back the stick would have hit in the the face."
When the manager asked him to put the stick down, Williams said "What if I don't?" and jabbed the stick toward him again, the report said.
"At one point during the altercation, Williams followed a family outside of the bar where, as the family got into their car, Williams flicked a cigarette through a car window at a woman, striking her just below her eye," the police news release said. "Williams also threw a rock at the family's car."
Virgilio said he would request additional charges against Williams, including reckless endangerment, because the rock hit a window in the family's car, "directly next to an 8-year-old girl."
"Had the glass shattered or the rock had penetrated the window, it could have struck and harmed the 8-year-old victim," he said.
Williams began his career as a stand-up comic, gaining attention in 1999 for comedy club appearances. Television appearances on the BET network led to more success.
His 2006 HBO special "Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1" raised his profile even higher.
He has acted in several movies, including Eddie Murphy's "Norbit," and his voice is featured in several popular cartoons, including "The Boondocks."
His often raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor.
CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.

Is secondhand smoke really that risky?�Asked by David, Tampa, Florida Really, how much secondhand smoke does a nonsmoker get anyway? If a person who smokes a pack a day for 30 years is only 1/3 more likely to die younger than a nonsmoker, then how likely is it that a nonsmoker is even more likely to die younger merely because other people smoke? Conditions Expert
Dr. Otis Brawley
Chief Medical Officer,
American Cancer Society	Expert answer Dear David, I have to say I disagree with some of your risk assumptions. Smoking is always to be discouraged. I can think of no epidemic as devastating and preventable as that caused by tobacco consumption. Tobacco is the only product that I can think of that, when used as intended, causes premature death to at least half of its users. Smoking causes lung cancer, at least a dozen other cancers, as well as cardiovascular disease and lung disease. Secondhand smoke, which is also called environmental tobacco smoke, is smoke inhaled involuntarily. Secondhand smoke also causes lung cancer, heart and lung disease in non-smokers. There is no safe level of exposure, but long-term exposure increases risk of lung cancer by 10% to 15% and heart disease by 30%. This translates into 5,000 to 10,000 lung cancer deaths and 40,000 heart disease deaths each year in the United States. Worldwide, it is estimated that exposure to secondhand smoke caused 50,000 lung cancer deaths and 379,000 heart disease deaths in 2004. Components of tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, benzene and small particles can easily be measured in the air of a smoker's home or workplace. It is truly a form of indoor air pollution. These smoke byproducts can be measured in the blood and urine of nonsmokers exposed to them. This means they inhaled the byproducts and the byproducts got into their body. Someone who is around a smoker inhales more benzene, a cause of leukemia, than he or she would inhale spending the same amount of time filling a car with gasoline. We worry about exposure of children and especially young children who cannot get away from adult parents who smoke. Children are also destined to long-term secondhand smoke exposure. Secondhand smoke exposure causes eye irritation, asthma and other acute respiratory diseases and is thought to be a cause of infant crib death. The initial studies showing that secondhand smoke is dangerous compared nonsmoking spouses of smokers with age-matched nonsmoking controls who were married to nonsmokers. The spouses of the smokers had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer. Also, a study of nonsmoking flight attendants who worked when smoking was allowed on aircraft had higher lung cancer rates than nonsmoking airline employees who did not work onboard. The tight confines of the airplane gave them especially heavy doses of secondhand smoke. Numerous studies of secondhand smoke have been completed over the past 40 years. A meta-analysis of 52 studies prepared for the 2006 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health showed that nonsmokers who had long-term (more than 20 years) exposure to secondhand smoke were 1.21 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with nonsmokers who were never exposed to secondhand smoke. A second meta-analysis of 25 studies showed that nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke were 20% more likely to develop lung cancer compared with nonsmokers working in a smoke-free environment. Interestingly, the biggest benefit from limiting secondhand smoke is from reduction in cardiac disease. It has been demonstrated several times that towns initiating laws limiting public and workplace smoking see in a decrease in heart attack rates within one year of enacting the laws. « Back to Conditions

Teeny-tiny Portland park has an itsy-bitsy theft
By Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 2:33 AM EST, Sat March 9, 2013
The Portland Parks and Recreation department took over care and maintenance of Mill Ends park in 1976. The park was dubbed "World's Smallest Park" by Dick Fagan, a writer for the Oregon Journal who first planted flowers there. This is how the park appeared in 2001.
A stolen tree, here returned, lies on the ground next to the one the Parks department planted to replace it at Mill Ends Park in Portland, Oregon, on Friday, March 9. The department says they will replant the returned one in another location if it is still viable.
Events at the park have included concerts by the Clan Macleay Pipe Band, picnics, and rose plantings by the Junior Rose Festival Court. Here the park is seen in 2004.
The park had to be moved temporarily in 2006 due to construction on Naito Parkway. This photo shows the parks vegetation being moved from its temporary home.
The park was reopened on March 16, 2007, in true St. Patrick's Day style with the Royal Rosarians, bagpipers, and members of the Fagan family, including Dick Fagen's wife Katherine, in attendance.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A tiny Portland, Oregon, park loses its only tree to theft
At just 2 feet across, Mill Ends Park is billed as the world's smallest
A newspaper columnist started the park in an abandoned street light hole in 1948
The city took it over in 1976
(CNN) -- The last time Mill Ends Park was in the news, it was full of teeny-tiny plastic police officers, a whole lot of teeny-tiny protest signs, and one scrawny evergreen tree.
That's the kind of place it is, all 452 square inches of it.
What's billed as the world's smallest park, tucked inside a concrete circle just 2 feet across, is a quirky Portland kind of place.
It's the site of itty-bitty protests -- including that 2011 Occupy Portland protest covered by CNN affiliate KATU -- teensy-weensy swimming pools and way small diving boards -- for the diminutive butterflies, of course.
And then, for a short time it seems, someone stole its lone tree. The diminutive evergreen disappeared sometime last week from the downtown street-corner park, KATU reported, citing the Portland Parks and Recreation Department.
It was more of a crisis than you might think: The place is also reputedly the home of leprechaun Patrick O'Toole, whom the late Oregon Journal columnist Dick Fagan claimed granted him a wish of having his own park.
World's smallest park loses lone tree
According to the parks department, Fagan planted flowers in an unused hole in the median outside his newsroom office way back in 1948.
He frequently wrote about it in the years before his death in 1969, frequently weaving in fanciful tales involving O'Toole and other leprechauns, according to numerous accounts of the celebrated little park.
The city took it over on St. Patrick's Day in 1976, and good-natured park workers have tended to the tiny plot ever since.
So, on discovering the tree was gone, of course they quickly scraped up $3.25 for a new one, hurried downtown and planted the replacement before the notoriously fickle-tempered leprechaun could make any trouble, KATU reported.
The new tree is a Douglas fir sapling, CNN affiliate KPTV reported.
"It was important to replace it so the leprechaun there had some shade from the sun," a suitably deferential park official, Mark Ross, told KATU.
But just after the tiny replacement tree was planted, the old tree returned.
A driver noticed the diminutive tree Friday "roots and all, lying on its side just outside the park," Portland Parks & Recreation said.
Some wondered if tree bandit had felt remorse.
"Whatever the motivation, we are relieved," says Portland Parks & Recreation Director Mike Abbate.
But police were still on the case.
"Remorse does not mean case closed'," says Portland Police Bureau Sergeant Pete Simpson. "We will pursue ... our investigation and hope that justice is served, and served swiftly".

E-cigarettes: Healthy tool or gateway device?
By Jen Christensen, CNN
updated 12:46 PM EST, Thu February 6, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Smoking is still the leading cause of avoidable death in the United States
E-cigarettes are being used by more people as a nicotine alternative Opponents worry e-cigarettes are being marketed to kids, who may be hooked for life
(CNN) -- If the tiny sample of smokers in a new study in the British journal Lancet are any indication, electronic cigarettes might be slightly more effective than nicotine patches in helping people quit smoking.
Great, right? Except another new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests more children and teens are trying them.
The implications of both these studies means electronic cigarettes have been getting a lot of attention lately. Just what e-cigarettes are and what role they should play in helping people quit smoking depends very much on who you speak with about this topic.
Smoking is still the leading cause of avoidable death in the United States. The devices are not one of the FDA-approved methods to help people quit, but many people are using them this way. A growing number of scientists are studying them to see whether they may be a way to end an epidemic.
New cigarette trend 'smokeless'
E-cigarette sales on the rise
The topic, though, remains as polarizing a health issue as sex education or diet sodas.
An e-what?
The e-cigarette was actually developed by a pharmacist in China.
The pharmacist, Hon Lik, was a three-pack-a-day smoker. That was nothing unusual -- more than 300 million people in China are regular smokers. But when Lik's father, who was also a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer, Lik decided he had to come up with an alternative that wouldn't kill him.
Most scientists believe nicotine itself, while highly addictive, is not what causes cancer for smokers or for the people around them who breathe their second-hand smoke. Instead, it's the toxic chemicals that are created when tobacco and filler products burn that are dangerous.
If there was a way to get nicotine addicts their fix without the burn, you just might avoid the health problems. Nicotine then becomes as harmless as any other addictive substance, such as caffeine, some experts say.
So Lik developed an e-cigarette -- a device that uses a small battery to atomize a pure liquid solution of nicotine. Nothing is burned. There is no ash. There is no smoke. There is nicotine, and then there is flavoring added for taste.
Essentially the person using these inhales a kind of vapor that looks like fog from a fog machine. A recent review of all the scientific research done on e-cigarettes by Drexel University professor Igor Burstyn concludes "current data do not indicate that exposures to vapors from contaminants in electronic cigarettes warrant a concern."
In plain language, Burstyn concludes: "It's about as harmless as you can get."
"I wouldn't worry at all if someone was smoking one of these by my kids," Burstyn said. "From a pure health perspective, these are not as bad as a cigarette."
E-cigarettes came to the U.S. market around 2009. The CDC now estimates about one in five American smokers have tried an e-cigarette -- that's about 6% of all adults. There are e-cigarette stores, but now you can also buy them online or in convenience stores. Some look like regular cigarettes; some look like pens or thumb drives.
First you buy a starter kit, which costs between $40 and $130. In the kit is the e-cigarette, a charger and a few cartridges. The cartridges typically last as long as a 20-pack of cigarettes and sell for around $10. You can also buy a bottle of e-liquid to refile the cartridge yourself.
The anti-e-cigarette camp
Critics point out e-cigarettes come in kid-friendly flavors such as gummy bear, atomic fireball candy and cookies and cream. It makes them worry that e-cigarettes will become a gateway to encourage kids to develop a lifelong nicotine addiction -- or worse, try the real thing.
Only about 20 states specifically forbid the sale of e-cigarettes to children.
Tobacco use has been on the decline with kids; it's about half what it was in the mid-1990s. But the latest CDC study shows a growing number of middle and high school students have tried e-cigarettes.
One in 10 high school students surveyed said they had tried e-cigarettes last year. That's double the number from 2011. One high school in Connecticut banned them after the principal said administrators dealt with at least one incident involving e-cigarettes every day.
CDC director Tom Frieden characterized this trend as "deeply troubling." But as far as risky behavior goes, it's still a tiny fraction of students. The survey showed about 3% of these kids said they had used one in the last 30 days. By contrast, 39% of students said they drank some amount of alcohol in the past 30 days, 22% binge drank and 24% rode with a driver who had been drinking.
The real problem is that 88% of adult smokers who smoke daily said they started when they were kids, according to the CDC. Kids who start down the path to using e-cigarettes may stick with them for life.
"So much is unknown about them and what the long-term complications could be with their use," said the American Lung Association's Erika Sward. "Bottom line, we don't know what the consequences of using them are, and we are very troubled that kids would find them attractive."
E-cigarettes are unregulated in the United States; no laws make manufacturers tell you what you are actually inhaling. The unknown is one of the many qualities of e-cigarettes that the American Lung Association doesn't like.
It's "a complete unregulated Wild West," Sward said. She wants the FDA to move quickly with regulatory oversight, which she says would make manufacturers disclose what the actual ingredients are in each of the 250 or so brands available.
In 2009, a FDA test on a small number of e-cigarette samples found "detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals to which users could potentially be exposed." They found diethylene glycol in one cartridge at a 1% level; this is an ingredient used in antifreeze and can be toxic to humans in large quantities. Diethylene glycol is also found in some dental products and in some pharmaceuticals.
After that study, the FDA banned the sale of e-cigarettes. They warned e-cigarette smokers that they were inhaling "toxic" and "harmful" chemicals. However, in 2010, a court ruled that "the FDA had cited no evidence to show that electronic cigarettes harmed anyone," and stores could go on selling them.
The early e-adopters
On the other side of the debate are the passionate supporters of e-cigarettes. Many who use them say it is the first thing that has helped them stop using cigarettes -- something more than 90% of smokers fail to do with any of the existing FDA-approved methods. There are blogs and message boards dedicated to them. And there are countless impassioned testimonials from the people who use them.
Florida resident Craig Lashley says they've changed his life.
"I got tired of being like that little kid in 'Peanuts' who had the cloud of smoke following him all the time," Lashley said. "I didn't like the way I smelled when I smoked, and I didn't like what smoking said about me, especially to kids."
He discovered the e-cigarette about a year ago and hasn't smoked a regular cigarette since.
He says he smells better, feels better and spends a lot less -- about $10 a week on e-cigarettes. He used to spend about $45 a week on regular cigarettes.
"I like the feel of blowing smoke," Lashley said. "It seems to me like (e-cigarettes are) a healthier alternative."
A growing number of respected physicians and scientists agree, and they say these products could end a major health problem.
"Electronic cigarettes and other nicotine-containing devices offer massive potential to improve public health, by providing smokers with a much safer alternative to tobacco," the Royal College of Physicians says. "They need to be widely available and affordable to smokers."
The latest study, published in the British journal the Lancet, examined whether people who used them as an alternative to smoking would abstain from using regular cigarettes.
The New Zealand authors studied the behavior of 657 people who were trying to quit. One group got nicotine patches, another got nicotine e-cigarettes and others got placebo e-cigarettes without the nicotine.
Over a period of six months, only a tiny fraction of the people in the study actually quit smoking.
People using the nicotine e-cigarettes quit at a slightly better rate compared with those using the patch, though. Some 7.3% using the e-cigarettes abstained from smoking traditional cigarettes compared with the 5.8% who stopped with the patch. About 4.1% stopped with just the placebo e-cigarettes.
It was such a small number of people who quit that the authors concluded "more research is urgently needed to clearly establish their overall benefits and harms at both individual and population levels."
Dr. Michael Siegel, a physician who has spent the past couple decades working on tobacco control initiatives, has been surprised by the negative reaction to e-cigarettes from so many people in the public health sector. Siegel says the studies he's done have shown e-cigarettes are a help.
"True we don't know the long-term health effect of e-cigarettes, but there's a very good likelihood that smokers are going to get lung cancer if they don't quit smoking," he said. "If they can switch to these and quit smoking traditional cigarettes, why condemn them?"
Siegel theorizes the e-cigarettes might look too much like smoking.
"It's ironic the very thing that makes them so effective ... drives the anti-smoking groups crazy. But what makes them so effective is it mimics the physical behaviors smokers have, which is something the patch can't do."
Siegel does believe there is an urgent need for more regulations.
Ray Story, founder of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, agrees. He says his association has also pushed for age verification legislation.
"When you have these companies trying to promote these as something they are not, and you have stores that sell them in the candy aisle, you are going to have a problem," Story said. "If they are officially categorized as a tobacco product, you get an automatic age verification put in place.
"Nicotine is addictive, and we want the federal government to create guidelines and a structure that will confine these to being sold as adult products."
Lashley says no matter what the debate, he will continue to spread the e-cigarette gospel to his fellow adults.
So far, his co-workers have been receptive to the idea. He used to be the only one with an e-cigarette on smoke breaks. Now he says he's got more than a dozen colleagues doing the same.
One colleague, though, complained about it.
"He said 'I'm sick of all these people smoking electronic cigarettes," Lashley said. "When I asked him why he said. 'Simple, now I can't bum any off of them.' "

Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market
By Katie Hunt, CNN
updated 8:57 PM EST, Sun November 3, 2013
Liu Jianle is a veteran of the Shanghai marriage market. He has already found a wife for his son. Now, he's looking for a match for his niece.
The marriage market takes place in a shaded park in the center of Shanghai.
Professional matchmaker Fan Dongfang holds up wedding invitations from couples he successfully paired.
Posters list a man or woman's height, age, income, education and their hukou - registered hometown.
With young Chinese told from a young age to put education and work before finding love, many struggle to find boyfriends or girlfriends.
The market has a special place for parents whose children are working overseas.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Each weekend, parents gather in Shanghai park to find partners for their children
Posters list their offspring's vital statistics -- height, age, weight, occupation and income
Odds for a successful match, at least for parents with daughters, do not look good
Shanghai (CNN) -- Liu Jianle smiles as he spots a potential suitor for his recently divorced niece among a sea of white personal ads pegged to a board.
Pencil in hand, he jots down the man's details -- 33 years old, 1.7 meters tall (5 feet 7 inches), 140 pounds, a property owner, divorced but no kids.
The only wrinkle is that his salary is $800 a month, not high by Shanghai standards. No matter, says Liu, his niece has a good job.
Welcome to Shanghai's marriage market.
Matchmaking: Chinese style
Each weekend, mothers, fathers and, in Liu's case, concerned uncles, come to a sun-dappled corner of Shanghai's People's Park to find Mister or Miss Right for their children.
Some write posters by hand listing their offsprings' vital statistics -- height, age, income, education and their hukou or registered hometown -- and pin them to umbrellas or shopping bags. Others come with a notebook to see what is available.
Liu is a veteran. He found his son a wife here and they've been married for more than a year.
"She's 1.69 meters tall (5 feet 6 inches) and beautiful like a movie star," he says. "He was happy to get the introduction."
With young Chinese told to put education and work before finding love, many struggle to find boyfriends or girlfriends, a source of deep concern for their parents in a society which emphasizes the survival of the family line.
Worried family members are joined by professional matchmakers, who try to make a living from the unusual gathering.
The city even organizes an "annual love and marriage expo" to help young people find love that attracts 18,000.
"A lot of kids who were born after 1980, they don't have siblings. So they grow up in an environment where you don't have the experience to meet with people of the opposite sex," Song Li, the founder of an online dating service, told CNN at the event in May.
READ: China plays the dating game
The market has been around since 2004, says Li, who runs a professional matchmaking service from the park. With almost three times as many women looking for partners than men, it can be difficult to make a successful match.
Men can register for free, while she charges a fee of $500 for her female clients.
She also has an age limit; men born after 1970 can sign up, but women must be under 33.
"There's a shortage of superior men," she says by way of explanation.
READ: China's 'leftover women' choose to stay single
It's a similar story at Fan Dongfang's booth. He says he matches 20 to 30 people a year and brandishes a clutch of wedding invitations as if to prove it. He also has a glut of women on his books.
"There are too many leftover women in Shanghai," he says, using a popular term to describe an educated, single, urban women over the age of 27.
"Their standards are too high."
While the numbers stack up in favor of Chinese women -- according to the China Statistics Bureau, there are now 34 million more men than women in China -- this doesn't mean they will pair up easily.
READ: China's biggest problem? Too many men
Chinese men tend to "marry down" both in terms of age and educational level, observers say. Plus, many of China's unmarried men live in the countryside.
Distance is no obstacle to the parents' matchmaking ambitions, nor is their children's consent.
One mother displays a handwritten A4-sized poster in a clear plastic wallet seeking a match for her 36-year-old daughter, who works as an accountant in Toronto. The market has an "overseas corner" for parents who have children living abroad.
"I can't give you my name because my daughter doesn't know I'm doing this and I don't want her to find out," she says.
"I just want her to find someone with a stable job, who is tolerant and open-minded."
