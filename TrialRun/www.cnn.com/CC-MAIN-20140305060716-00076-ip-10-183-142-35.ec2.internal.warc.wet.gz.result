New York (CNN) -- A man long considered a person of interest in the disappearance of an exotic dancer was charged during the weekend with killing her, authorities said. Daniel Moore, 40, a local businessman, was taken into custody Friday evening in Arlington, Texas, said Sgt. Gary Landers of the Euless Police Department. Moore, a car salesman, was released after posting $35,000 bond. Moore is accused in the death of Kristen Charbonneau, 25, who vanished during the summer of 2005. Her body has not been found. Moore's attorney did not return CNN's phone call requesting comment. But he told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram last summer that his client was innocent of wrongdoing. The young woman's parents, who were certain from almost the beginning that Moore was responsible, said they were still stunned when detectives told them of the arrest. They had publicly named Moore as the suspect in flyers distributed in his neighborhood. "I just tore the house all up; I lost it," David Charbonneau said, describing his reaction to the arrest. "The family had to crawl on top of me to hold me down. I cried out, 'My baby girl, my poor baby girl.'" "When we found this out, it just hit me like a freight train, and I wasn't expecting that," Monica Charbonneau told CNN. "I've waited a long time to say his name out in public." Police would not disclose details about the evidence. "We'll present the case to the grand jury, and they'll make their decision," said Sgt. Landers. But key facts surrounding the investigation have been known for some time. Charbonneau was last seen on the afternoon of August 11, 2005, as she was leaving the Baby Dolls strip club in Fort Worth, Texas, where she worked. A customer followed her out the door, investigators said. She had called for a taxi to take her home but when the cab arrived to pick her up, she was gone. Monica Charbonneau said Moore was familiar with her daughter. "He knew her very well," she said. "They sat at the table together several times. When I started piecing all that together, I thought this is it, this is him." Family members conducted their own searches. They also created a Web site to generate leads, find witnesses and keep her memory alive. In addition, the Charbonneaus wrote to Texas officials, urging them to help in the investigation. Monica Charbonneau believes the Web site and the letters were instrumental in Moore's arrest, although she would not elaborate. The slain dancer's father said he often thought about taking the law into his own hands. "I would wake up every morning and every night looking at my shotgun; it would be the first thing there, and there were many times it would be loaded," he said. He also said he had a "hit kit" to nail the suspect to a tree, to "get this man to tell me where my daughter's body was." "I know that sounds as sick as could be, and as a father and human being I never thought I could even think that way, but when something like this is taken from you, and you as a father ... you find out what you are really made of. I guess I was made of more than I thought I was." The Charbonneaus call this the "first step" in what they understand will be a lengthy process through the criminal justice system. They want people to know about the young woman whose life was cut short by a killer. "What can I say? I was her father," David Charbonneau said. "She was very loving, and she was a sweetheart." "She liked to stay home, watch TV, watch a movie," said Monica Charbonneau. "And she wanted to spend time with her family." The couple said their daughter did not want them to know she was dancing at a strip club. "I thought she was waiting tables," David Charbonneau said. "I didn't know until the last part, the last two weeks, she was dancing ... She was ashamed of what she was doing. It just ate her up." Just days before she vanished, Charbonneau visited her parents at their home. A photograph taken during the visit is featured on the Web site. "She had come over here, and she had said she wanted to settle down," her mother said. "She was tired of what she had done. And you can see it in her face." The Charbonneaus say they want the suspect to tell them where their daughter's body is. "I would want him to tell us where she's at so that we can bring her home and have that closure," Monica Charbonneau said. "I'm not sure if I want to know what happened that day," she added. "I don't know if that would help me. But I do want to know where she's at, that I need to know."

Spyware assails Russian opposition members
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 12:34 PM EST, Fri March 9, 2012 | Filed under: Web
The e-mail contains a document that reveals an announcement for a supposed anti-Putin rally with a map.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Spam e-mails promoting a rally against President-elect Putin contain spyware
E-mails began circulating around March 5, Symantec says
Virus overwrites many of the user's files then deletes them thoroughly
(CNN) -- A computer virus campaign is targeting opponents of Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin, according to anti-virus software maker Symantec.
"A wave of spam e-mails promoting a rally" against the newly elected president is delivering the spyware as an attachment that appears to be a Word document. In reality, the file is a software program known as "Trojan.Dropper."
The spam e-mails began circulating sometime around March 5, according to an entry Wednesday on Symantec's official blog.
The subject lines in the e-mails call demonstrators to action with phrases like: "all to demonstration," "instructions what to do," or "meeting for the equal elections." The body of the e-mail pushes the recipient to open an attachment, purporting that it contains need-to-know information.
When the user opens the file, a document does actually open revealing an announcement for a supposed anti-Putin rally with a map indicating its apparent location. But at the same time, the file drops a Trojan horse virus onto the unwitting user's computer.
Once on the computer, the virus overwrites many of the user's files then deletes them thoroughly.
"The Trojan also attempts to connect to IP address 193.104.153.31 (down at the time of analysis)," Symantec says.
This server address is located in Switzerland, but it is associated with another "notorious" virus that once operated off of a Web address with a Russian domain name.
At the end of its virulent rampage, the malware crashes the victim's computer, causing it to blue-screen.
Symantec characterizes the spam attack as "unusual -- mainly because of its size." These messages average 500 KB in size -- 50 times the usual size of junk e-mails. "Most spam messages do not exceed 10 KB," the IT security company points out.
Antivirus software has been adjusted to recognize the malware, but Symantec warns on its blog: "As always, be aware of any unsolicited e-mails containing attachments, which might take advantage of current events like the recent election result in Russia."

The 10 best video games of 2012
By Larry Frum, Special to CNN
updated 9:22 AM EST, Thu December 27, 2012 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
"Dishonored," a stealth adventure game set in a grimy industrial city, offers a first-person perspective and an emphasis on player choice.
"XCOM: Enemy Unknown" presents gamers with a big challenge: Build and lead a worldwide military force to defend Earth from alien invaders with superior technology.
"Borderlands 2" adds a great new storyline and characters to the original's "shoot everything" style of gameplay.
"Halo 4" is a wonderful new addition to the beloved sci-fi action franchise and the best "Halo" campaign so far.
In "Mass Effect 3," the final chapter in a planned trilogy, players must unite the galaxy to recapture Earth from alien invaders.
"Far Cry 3" is a character-centered story of adventure set in an open-sandbox world where exploration is key to survival.
In this game for the handheld PlayStation Vita, players must guide two characters through a series of puzzle rooms to safety. Without a word of dialogue, "Journey" transports players to a magical land where discovery is the object of the game.
"Spec Ops: The Line" helps players delve into the psyche of a soldier without making it feel like a fantasy trip. Zombies overrun a supermarket in this scene from "ZombiU," a dark tale of survival during a zombie outbreak in London.

(CNN) -- With new installments of popular franchises such as "Halo" and "Call of Duty," expectations ran high for video games in 2012.
While the year's most anticipated title, "BioShock Infinite," got pushed to 2013, there were still plenty of games that pushed new boundaries with innovative story lines, fantastic graphics and creative storytelling.
Two new consoles, the handheld PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo Wii U, introduced new gameplay options with touch screen controls and cross-platform titles. Meanwhile, the shaky economy continued to plague the video game industry, as some big developers filed for bankruptcy while upstarts turned to Kickstarter to finance their game projects.
Of course, any Top 10 list is subjective, depending on individual tastes. For me, the games on this list were the most well-made, the most fun to play and, thanks to some intriguing elements, the hardest to put down. (There were some fine games that came out this year that I never got the chance to play, so feel free to make suggestions or disagree with my choices in the comments.)
Here's my list, counted down from No. 10 to my favorite game of the year:
Halo 4 demo makes E3 appearance
10. "ZombiU"
This dark tale of survival during a zombie outbreak in London captured my attention for its unique style of gameplay and gritty scenarios. Players must figure out how to survive using their wits, not a plethora of weapons. And when you do die (and you will), your former character becomes a zombie for your next human character to face. So you get to kill your former self and get all your loot back. It's very twisted -- and a nice change of pace for a Nintendo console.
9. 'Spec Ops: The Line'
While it may look like a typical war shooter game, "Spec Ops: The Line" raised the storytelling bar by examining what war feels like on an individual level. This realistic desert-setting game hooks your emotions early on, and its action keeps you on edge until the story's dramatic finish. It was a bold move by the writers to delve into the psyche of a soldier without making it feel like a fantasy trip.
8. 'Journey'
I'll be the first to admit I didn't grasp what "Journey" was about at first. But the more I played, the more I began to understand that a game with artistic value can be just as exciting as a racing game. Without a word of dialogue, the game transports players to a magical desert where they journey toward a mysterious mountain and discovery is the object of the game. By encouraging you to assist other players on the same path, "Journey" tugs at your emotions and maintains a connection that makes it hard to put down. The game is over too quickly, but every replay allows for more exposure to its fantastic world.
7. 'Escape Plan'
It won't be on many year-end lists, but this game was funny and exciting while demonstrating the strengths of the PlayStation Vita. Lil and Laarg, two unique characters with divergent abilities, must be guided through a series of dangerous puzzle rooms to get to safety. Players move them via various inputs on the Vita (dual touchscreens, microphone, analog joysticks), but failure is often accompanied by a gruesome (and sometimes humorous) death. "Escape Plan" still gets played in my house months after its release -- plus, seeing Lil on his coffee buzz is just laugh-out-loud funny.
6. 'Far Cry 3'
The first of the year's many sequels to make my list, "Far Cry 3" takes a character-centric story of growth and danger and drops it into an open-sandbox world where you must adapt to survive. Described by others as " 'Skyrim' with guns," it goes beyond that into an exploration of personal change against overwhelming odds. Your character starts out as a timid party boy, stranded on an lawless tropical island, and evolves by necessity into something more deadly. The immersive first-person story and complex characters -- you will really hate the bad guys -- will keep you hooked throughout.
5. 'Mass Effect 3'
Aside from its ending, which has been criticized for its lack of closure, "Mass Effect 3" is a fantastic dive back into the galactic world of protagonist Commander Shepard. Players must chart their own course through this space-war adventure, choosing their morality along the way, to resolve a storyline that began two games ago. Are all plotline questions answered? No. But that doesn't diminish the game's vast universe of aliens and enemies. I'll be sad Shepard won't be back (BioWare has said he's not part of "Mass Effect 4"), but this game will be remembered for how invested players became in his ultimate fate.
4. 'Halo 4'
Speaking of endings, "Halo 4" brought a close to one of the popular characters in this sci-fi action franchise. No, not Master Chief, the super-soldier who will live on to kick more alien tail, but his artificial-intelligence companion, Cortana. The game's graphics are almost film-level quality, and the range of environments keeps the pacing fresh. I wish there weren't so many tangents into the non-gaming lore of the franchise. But the game's emotional ending, when we realize how much Master Chief cared about his sidekick, put "Halo 4" on the top shelf for me.
3. 'Borderlands 2'
First-person shooter "Borderlands 2" takes players back to the ravaged planet Pandora while improving on what was already a good game. The guns (lots of guns) and the violence (oh, the violence) are still there. But the introduction of villain Handsome Jack and his twisted sense of right and wrong give the player a welcome target to aim for. The loathing you'll feel for Jack by the end will be palpable. I wanted to do the next mission just to find out what was going to happen. "Borderlands 2" offers the perfect mix of intrigue, explosions and humor.
2. 'XCOM: Enemy Unknown'
This turn-based combination strategy/squad combat game brings thoughtful gaming to a new level. One part is resource management: Can you build and lead a worldwide military force tasked with defending Earth from alien invaders? The other part is squad-level combat: Can you direct your troops to victory on various fields of battle against foes who are bent on your death? This blend of styles kept me playing for hours on end.
1. 'Dishonored"
Set in a rotting, alternate-universe world where steampunk visuals blend with advanced technology, "Dishonored" forces you to seek revenge for being framed for a murder you didn't commit. As you set out to assassinate your enemies, there are two extreme modes of play -- stealth or combat -- and you can choose between the divergent styles as you see fit. The pacing is your own. The decisions, for better or worse, are yours to make. But they will have consequences along the way, so choose wisely. With a fantastic setting, an excellent storyline and the ability to make the adventures your own, "Dishonored" is my choice for the best game of 2012.

Oprah Winfrey speaks with Lance Armstrong during an interview on the controversy surrounding his cycling career on Monday, January 14, in Austin, Texas. Oprah Winfrey's exclusive no-holds-barred interview with Lance Armstrong, "Oprah and Lance Armstrong: The Worldwide Exclusive," has expanded to air as a two-night event on OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network. The interview airs Thursday, January 17, and Friday, January 18.
Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France wins and banned from the tournament for life, the International Cycling Union announced Monday, October 22.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lance Armstrong admits to using EPO, blood transfusions and testosterone
EPO and blood transfusions increase red blood cell count to raise oxygen levels
Armstrong is also accused of using cortiocosteroids to decrease inflammation
(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Thursday night.
Did he use EPO? Testosterone? Cortisone? Human growth hormone? Illegal blood transfusions and other blood doping? Armstrong answered "yes" on all counts.
In October, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency released more than 1,000 pages of evidence in doping allegations against Armstrong and his teammates. He was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in the scandal. On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee demanded that he give back the bronze medal he won in 2000.
The charges against Armstrong are all too common in the cycling world. Cyclist Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test. Eighty percent of the Tour de France medalists between 1996 and 2010 have been "similarly tainted by doping," according to the USADA report on Armstrong.
A look at the drugs Armstrong used:

Blood doping
EPO, or erythropoietin, is a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency. Cyclists and other athletes use EPO to raise their red blood cell counts, which increases the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to muscles, improving recovery and endurance.
Although EPO has been banned since the 1990s, the first screening test was used at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney.
Blood transfusions have a similar effect on the body's red blood cell count. Usually an athlete will store some of his blood when his hemoglobin levels are high, then reinfuse it right before an event. This type of transfusion cannot be detected by current tests, according to the USADA.
Both methods can have dangerous side effects. Increased levels of hemoglobin, which literally thickens the blood, can lead to complications with circulation, putting athletes at risk for cardiovascular problems.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids are man-made drugs that resemble the natural hormone cortisol, according to the Cleveland Clinic. These are different from anabolic steroids, which athletes take to increase strength. The most common types are cortisone, prednisone and methylprednisolone.
Cortisol is most commonly known as a stress hormone. Corticosteroids work to decrease inflammation that can cause swelling and pain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They can be administered locally -- to the specific area that hurts -- or systemically through a pill or intravenously.
The list of possible side effects for corticosteroids is long, including weight gain, sudden mood swings, blurred vision, osteoporosis and high blood pressure.
"If steroid use involves high doses and is prolonged (for a few months to several years), an increase in the number of side effects might occur," the clinic's site states.
Testosterone
Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate bone density, fat distribution, muscle strength, red blood cell production and sex drive, according to the Mayo Clinic. It is found in both men and women; in men, it also helps to regulate sperm production.
Athletes generally abuse testosterone to "bulk up," according to the USADA. The side effects are similar to both blood doping and anabolic steroid use. Testosterone increases the body's red blood cell count, increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease. Mood swings, muscle weakness and liver dysfunction are also common for both sexes with overuse.
Using testosterone also shuts down the body's natural production of the hormone. This can cause the testicles to shrink in men, reducing sperm production.
Moving forward
Cyclists say Armstrong's confession and calls to clean up the sport may lead to a new era.
"From day one, we always hoped this investigation would bring to a close this troubling chapter in cycling's history and we hope the sport will use this tragedy to prevent it from ever happening again," USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement in October.
"Our mission is to protect clean athletes by preserving the integrity of competition not only for today's athletes but also the athletes of tomorrow. We have heard from many athletes who have faced an unfair dilemma -- dope, or don't compete at the highest levels of the sport. Many of them abandoned their dreams and left sport because they refused to endanger their health and participate in doping. That is a tragic choice no athlete should have to make."

U.S. offers $5 million for information leading to Joseph Kony, top associates
By CNN Staff
updated 5:23 AM EDT, Thu April 4, 2013
Ceasar Acellam, a senior member of the Lord's Resistance Army, at the Ugandan army base in Djema on May 13, 2012.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
U.S. State Department offers $5 million for Lord's Resistance Army leaders
One of them is Joseph Kony, who gained notoriety through a 2012 social media campaign
Money was made possible through an act signed by President Obama in January (CNN) -- The U.S. State Department is offering $5 million for information leading to the "arrest, transfer or conviction" of three top leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army, the department announced Wednesday.
One of those leaders, Joseph Kony, was the focus of a massive social media campaign called "Kony 2012."

Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming in part from allegations that he conscripted children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army, which operates in parts of Uganda and other parts of central Africa.
A small number of U.S. special forces are advising and assisting regional military efforts authorized by the African Union, the State Department said. Some of those U.S. advisers have been operating in southeastern Central African Republic, according to the department.
The reward money is available through the Department of State Rewards Program Update and Technical Corrections Act, which U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law in January.

2-year-old gets weight-loss surgery: How young is too young?
By Kelly Wallace, CNN updated 9:26 AM EDT, Sat September 21, 2013
The two-year-old Saudi patient is seen here before bariatric surgery to reduce his weight.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
2-year-old obese boy believed to be youngest ever to have weight-loss surgery The boy suffered from sleep apnea which restricted his breathing when he slept
Doctors say typically girls under 13 and boys under 15 don't have weight-loss surgery Women around the country reacted with sadness and concerns about the message it might send Editor's note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. She's a mom of two girls and lives in Manhattan. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- When you hear the story of a 2-year-old boy believed to be the youngest person in the world ever to have bariatric surgery, it's very easy to "point a judgmental finger," as one mom said to me.
"Wasn't there anything else the parents could do besides such a serious surgery at such a young age?" parents will ask.
But then you hear the story of now 18-year-old Maria Caprigno, who weighed 443 pounds when she was just 14.
"I was gaining 40 pounds a year," said Caprigno, in between classes at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts. "They told me unless something drastic happened, I would not see my 18th birthday."
The child after surgery
Listening to Caprigno, it becomes clear that the decision by the boy's parents -- and what they did or did not do before the surgery -- is not so black and white. And as parents grapple with the option of early surgical intervention for childhood obesity, they also must examine whether it's only their child's health on the line or if appearance and social standards are influencing these decisions too.
The boy, from Saudi Arabia, weighed 79 pounds by the age of 2, and suffered from severe sleep apnea which caused him to stop breathing while asleep.

Mom defends putting 7-year-old on diet
After two different attempts to control the boy's weight through dieting reportedly failed, doctors decided to perform what's called a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which involves permanently removing 60 to 85% of the stomach and restricting food intake.
Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in Atlanta, said such a procedure should be a last resort, and only after close monitoring and dieting have been attempted and proven to be unsuccessful.
Without knowing the details of this particular case, she said that if doctors had not performed the surgery, the boy could have faced physical problems such as pain, injuries and bowed legs, heart disease and diabetes down the road and even death, from the lack of oxygen caused by the sleep apnea.
"I think what (the doctors) are trying to say is this kid may not live without the surgery or without reversing that weight gain," said Shu, CNNHealth's Living Well expert doctor who is also a mother of two.
Shu says the current recommendation is to wait until the child is done growing or close to it, which is around 13 for girls and 15 for boys before considering bariatric surgery.
Caprigno had such surgery three years ago, when she was just 14. To her knowledge, at the time, she was one of the youngest people ever to have it.
It was an immensely difficult decision for her parents, who were both "morbidly obese," she said. Her dad, who also had bariatric surgery, still weighs over 400 pounds.
"My mom always said she was so nervous about putting me under this knife," said Caprigno, who said her mom had the lap-band procedure, which involves placing a device around the top of the stomach to control food intake, before she had hers.
"She told me she wasn't putting me under a knife that she hadn't been under herself," she said. "And I can't even imagine how difficult that decision was for her to allow me to do this and it must be so much harder for the parents of a 2-year-old to do that."
Signs of progress in childhood obesity fight
In my conversations with women across the country, a universal feeling about this case was sorrow for this little boy.
"I'm very saddened to learn of the extreme measures that were taken for the health of this toddler," said Lori Garcia, a mom of two boys, ages 5 and 10, and host of the blog, Mommyfriend. "Were there no other or better alternatives than two failed attempts at dieting?"
Renae Wortz, who is a mom and nurse practitioner, also wondered whether there might have been a less invasive treatment to help the boy lose the weight, but she also thought about what she would do if she were in the same situation.
"I think parents will do anything, even if it's extreme, to help a sick child," said Wortz, who is one of the co-founders of the blog, Mom Colored Glasses. "Maybe they weren't able to stick to the diet, but maybe they were. Maybe they did everything they could to help him lose weight, but weren't successful in the end."
Why is it so hard for kids to lose weight?
Another pressing concern is the unknown long-term impact such a surgery could have on the child's development, including intellectual problems down the road. "The brain just grows so rapidly between birth to 3 years old, he's still in that very phase of development," said Shu. "So we don't know what kind of effects the surgery may have."
"Medicine is not a perfect science and without prior data (exploring similar cases), such impacts would be uncertain and that uncertainty would have to be factored in to the risk/benefit decision for the child's health," said Alpita Shah, an international finance and community development lawyer in Chicago.
iReport: Before weight loss, 'Every beat of my heart hurt'
Beyond the medical uncertainties and possible complications (which could include leakage, infection and blood clots), weight-loss surgery on a 2-year-old raises the question: What does this story say about us? What impact might it have on other kids and families struggling with weight?
"Skinny is not an equation for health," said blogger and author Liz Henry, whose work will be featured in the upcoming book "The Good Mother Myth." "This is unchartered territory and a dangerous precedent for still growing and maturing bodies."
Henry, who is passionate about body image issues, worries about the message this case might send.

"While this may be an extreme case, it can lead to other parents looking at the rubber-band wrists and pudgy thighs of their toddler and immediately seeking medical intervention that leads to irreversible harm," she said.
"I truly hope that pediatric gastric bypass surgery doesn't become just another 'norm' in our culture of instant gratification and 'easy fixes,' " said Wortz.
Physicians group labels obesity a disease
For her part, Caprigno, who has lost over 130 pounds following her surgery, and has completely changed the way she thinks about food, the takeaway from this story is for all of us to talk more openly about obesity and to understand what it is in the first place. The American Medical Association just recognized it as a disease back in June.
"We definitely need to recognize that there's no one to blame for this and that there are genetic components that play a part, lifestyle plays a part, and we just need to change how we view obesity because there's such a stigma," said Caprigno, who currently works with the nonprofit the Obesity Action Coalition.
"We try to get everyone to understand that this is a disease. It's not something we choose," she said.
