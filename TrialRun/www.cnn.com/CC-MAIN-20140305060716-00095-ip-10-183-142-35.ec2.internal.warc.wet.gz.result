Picky and proud of it: Paris' top baguettes
By Ellise Pierce Budget Travel Adjust font size:
(Budget Travel Online) -- Believe it or not, the humble baguette was headed for extinction not long ago. In the 1960s, boulangeries scrapped old-style methods in favor of industrialized baking, and the bread lost its flavor. But the French came to their senses by 1998. It's now against the law for a boulangerie to make bread by machine (it must be mixed and baked on-site) and good loaves are once again on the rise. In Paris, there's even a Grand Prix de la Baguette to name the best of the year. (Budget Travel's Paris Snap Guide)At most boulangeries, the least expensive baguette (often referred to as "ordinaire" and costing less than a euro) will not reflect the full talents of the baker. Spring for a baguette "traditionelle" or any of the house's other special loaves. Here are five places to get the very best.A block west of the Jardins du Luxembourg, Bread & Roses is well-known for its celeb clientele. (Among the frequent customers are actress Catherine Deneuve and designer In�s de la Fressange.) But the nearly two-year-old organic boulangerie is also making a name for itself with its Puissance Dix baguette ($2). Literally translated, the name means "the power of 10," a reference to the 10 flours -- including chestnut, buckwheat, corn and rye --incorporated into the dough. 7 rue de Fleurus, 6th arr., 011-33/1-42-22-06-06. M�tro: Notre-Dame-des-Champs.In the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, Le Quartier du Pain turns out eight different kinds of baguettes -- some flavored with olives, herbs or bacon -- six days a week (closed Sundays). In 1997, master baker Fr�d�ric Lalos ---just 26 at the time -- was named one of the best bakers in France. Before Lalos mixes sunflower, flax and sesame seeds into the dough for his Baguette C�r�ale ($2), he toasts them, to bring out maximum flavor. 74 rue Saint-Charles, 15th arr., 011-33/1-45-78-87-23. M�tro: Charles-Michels.At Le Moulin de la Vierge, a boulangerie housed in a mill built in 1356, Basile Kamir bakes his baguettes in an antique wood-burning oven out back. In 1975, when he bought the place, Kamir introduced his clients to sourdough, a leavening agent now used in an organic wheat baguette called the Flute Bio ($1.75). It's the perfect foil for the artisanal fig, raspberry and clementine jams from Burgundy ($6.25) that are also sold on the premises. 105 rue Vercing�torix, 14th arr., 011-33/1-45-43-09-84. M�tro: Pernety.Anis Bouabsa took over Au Duc de la Chapelle in 2005, and at 27, he's already placed in the Grand Prix de la Baguette. One taste of his Baguette Tzara ($1.25) is an indication why. He doesn't use a levain (sourdough starter), so there's a sweet rather than sour taste, and his dough is kneaded entirely by hand. The result: bread that's light, airy and moist, with a crust that tastes faintly of caramel. 32-34 rue Tristan Tzara, 18th arr., 011-33/1-40-38-18-98. M�tro: Marx Dormoy.The whole-wheat La Monge baguette ($1.25) is the most popular loaf at Eric Kayser, a chain of boulangeries with eight locations in Paris, including the original on rue Monge. The baguette takes 12 hours to produce and uses a secret blend of flours. The La Monge can be found on some of Paris's top tables, including upscale bistro Dominique Bouchet. 8 rue Monge, 5th arr., 011-33/1-44-07-01-42. M�tro: Maubert-Mutualit�.© 2006.

Homeless man breaks into abandoned bar, begins selling alcoholBy Lateef Mungin, CNN Police: Man breaks into bar, sells drinksSTORY HIGHLIGHTSSuspect sells alcohol for a weekend before detectives arriveSuspect allegedly broke into bar that was out of businessAuthorities learn about it from a newspaper article
RELATED TOPICS
California
(CNN) -- A homeless man allegedly broke into a California bar and served drinks to unsuspecting patrons all weekend -- before police came calling. The bar, called the Valencia Club, had gone out of business for some time and its liquor license had expired, police said this week. But the suspect, Travis Lloyd Kevie, 29, somehow got into the California establishment in the Penryn area of Sacramento Valley last week. He reopened the bar using beer he bought from a nearby store. Kevie allegedly started with a six-pack of beer and used money he received to buy more alcohol. He kept the bar open for a weekend serving about 30 customers a day, authorities said. He was so successful that a local newspaper did a story about the bar reopening. "A local newspaper report alerted a Placer County Sheriff's Office Detective of a possible ongoing crime being committed in the Penryn area," the Placer County Sheriff's Office said. "As Detective Jim Hudson read the morning newspaper he recognized an individual pictured on the front page as a local transient who has had numerous contact with the Placer County Sheriff's Office." A detective went to the bar to determine if Kevie had obtained a liquor license. "When Detective Hudson arrived at the Valencia Club it was open for business with customers bellied up to the bar. Upon questioning Kevie Detective Hudson determined that he had no connection to the property and he did not have a liquor license," the department said. Kevie was arrested Tuesday and charged with burglary and selling liquor without a license. A large amount of alcohol and cash was also confiscated from the bar. The newspaper, the Auburn Journal, that ran the story about the new "bar owner", reported that Kevie was arraigned on a single misdemeanor charge Thursday and ordered released from jail.CNN's Heather Murphy contributed to this report.

Judge declares mistrial in 'Desperate Housewives' lawsuit
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 5:28 AM EDT, Tue March 20, 2012
Actress Nicollette Sheridan sued the "Desperate Housewives" creator and ABC for wrongful termination.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Juror says she questioned credibility of ABC's witnesses
Actress Nicollette Sheridan sued the show's creator and ABC for wrongful termination
She claims her firing was in retaliation for complaining she was struck by show's creator
The jury was deadlocked at 8-4, in favor of the actress
Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial Monday in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against "Desperate Housewives" creator Marc Cherry and ABC.
The jury told the judge they were deadlocked at 8-4, in favor of the actress, after three days of deliberations. They needed nine jurors to agree on a verdict.
Sheridan sued, claiming her character was killed -- and her acting job eliminated -- in retaliation for her complaining that Cherry hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy.
Lawyers for Cherry and ABC's Touchstone Television argued the demise of her character was a creative decision unrelated to the workplace complaint.
ABC executives testified that Cherry gained their permission to have Edie Britt -- the sassy blonde played by Sheridan -- die in May 2008, four months before an incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan.
Feuding on 'Desperate Housewives' set
The hit during a rehearsal was just "a light tap on the head" intended to demonstrate "a piece of physical humor" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements.
Sheridan testified that Cherry hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene. "It was a nice wallop to my head" she said.
One juror who voted for Sheridan's case said afterward that the defense story "just didn't hold water for me."
Beverly Crosby, a retired elementary school principal, said her decision to find the studio liable was based on her doubts about the credibility of several defense witnesses, which included high-level ABC executives.
"There were a lot of people that some of the jurors found not too credible," Crosby said.
Juror Johnny Huynh, who also voted for Sheridan's side, said it seemed to him that ABC executives scripted their stories "just a little bit."
"I don't say they was scripted," Huyhn said. "It's more like the story don't match for me."
Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute said while there was no victory, the jury's 8-4 vote did send a message to ABC and parent company Disney.
"They had 10 witnesses tell their little scripted story, with no documents, and eight jurors looked at their best, their presidents, and said, 'No, I'm not buying it, I'm not buying what you're selling, Mr. President,' " Baute said.
Lawyers will now prepare for a retrial, because an out-of-court settlement is not expected, he said.
"My view is that Disney is the unhappiest place on Earth, so why would there ever be a settlement offer?" Baute said.
ABC lawyer Adam Levin said the retrial will be "far more narrow than the previous case" since the judge tossed out Sheridan's battery complaint, leaving only the wrongful termination issue against the studio. In fact, Cherry is no longer a defendant, he said.
The jury of nine women and three men began deliberating on Wednesday but told the judge on Monday morning they were hopelessly deadlocked.
Although the show's line producer reported the hitting incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Enquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, according to testimony.
What followed was a "fake" investigation designed "to protect the money machine known as 'Desperate Housewives,'" Baute said. "Nobody wants the 'Desperate Housewives' applecart turned upside down."
The human resources investigator did not interview Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
Five months and 11 episodes after the rehearsal incident, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on "Desperate Housewives."
"To my estimation, it wasn't handled correctly," juror Crosby said. "It wasn't handled the way it should have been handled."
Sheridan was asking for $5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry, although the actress was paid $4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series.

Why don't some boys see it as rape?
By Peggy R. Sanday, Special to CNN
updated 1:40 PM EST, Fri January 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A video shows boys talking about the alleged rape in Steubenville, Ohio
Peggy Sanday: Incident demonstrates a split in the boy rape-prone sexual culture
She says some boys stage a sexual spectacle for their mates as part of a night's fun
Sanday: Other boys are able to name rape when they see it, as some do in the video Editor's note: Peggy R. Sanday, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, is author of "Fraternity Gang Rape: Sex, Brotherhood, and Privilege on Campus" and "A Woman Scorned: Acquaintance Rape on Trial." (CNN) -- In the 1950s, I was almost gang-molested by a group of male fellow high school students. The incident took place one afternoon in the basement basketball court of the nearby Catholic church, of which I was a member. I had recently invited one member of the group to what I thought was an innocent get-together at a local square dance. I supposed later that they thought "I wanted it."
As I remember the incident, after some friendly play in the gym, the guys (four of them) turned on me, holding the ball as if I were the basket. The look on their faces terrified me. I ducked under their outstretched arms and ran, all the way home without looking back. I never mentioned the incident until 1983, when I spoke at a rally supporting a student of mine who was gang-raped at a fraternity party.
The rape case unraveling in Steubenville, Ohio, brought back memories of my own frightening experience. I didn't know what was happening that day when the four young men began looking at me differently. I only knew that I had to get away as soon as possible.
Peggy R. Sanday
In the Steubenville case, a girl purportedly passed out and was allegedly sexually assaulted by two young men on the high school football team while others watched.
What strikes me about the incident is that it demonstrates a split in the boy rape-prone sexual culture. Some young men continue to believe that when a girl gets drunk, staging a sexual spectacle for their mates is part of a night's fun. They don't think of it as rape. Some of their buddies, however, disagree. In their transition to manhood, they are able to name rape when they see it.
This split opinion is illustrated in the video posted a few days ago by Anonymous showing a young man -- presumably an eyewitness -- egged on by others, telling his version of what happened. The video footage is disturbing, to say the least.
Rape case shocks Ohio town
Murphy: Rape is grossly under prosecuted
He repeats in a litany format that the girl is dead. However, he doesn't mean lifeless, except in the sense that she isn't moving. "How do you feel on a dead girl?" he asks someone in the room. He describes her as "deader than a doornail." When asked "How do you know she's dead?" he answers that she is dead because she isn't moving.
He then goes on to describe how dead: "Deader than Andy Reid's son ... deader than Chris Henry ... deader than OJ's wife ... deader than f***ing JFK ... deader than Trayvon Martin." In other words, made only for use by men.
In the cacophony of voices spurring him on, one hears the word "rape" from one or two other voices. One says, "This is not funny," only to be drowned out by the laughter of the main speaker and those supporting him. When asked "What if that was your daughter?" he answers, "If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I'd just let her be dead." Besides, he says, "Is it really rape because you don't know if she wanted to or not," the teenager says on the video. "She might have wanted to."
In response, the onlooker says, "You are sick."
What happened in Steubenville that night in August seems to suggest that some sort of sexual assault took place, at least from this eyewitness account if the video is verified to be authentic. Most rape laws in the U.S. state that sexual activity on a person who is incapacitated or unable to consent constitutes rape.
One of the clauses of the Ohio law states that sexual activity is not permissible when "the other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age."
The girl's incapacity comes not just from the multiple mentions of her being dead in the video. There is also possibly a photo of her being dragged along held by her wrists and ankles by two boys.
In the United States, surveys administered from the early 1980s to the present indicate that 20% to 25% of female students say they have experienced nonconsensual sex by the age of 21. Every year, a high-profile case of gang rape appears in the news. With each new report, many Americans react with shock.
Confronted with such cases, many explain it away, thinking or actually saying "she wanted it." Why do we think this way? Doing so is behind the strange idea of "legitimate rape." When will our sexual culture change so that an inebriated girl (or boy) is protected rather than abused?

40 years after epic Arizona hotel fire, convicted man set free
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 7:20 PM EDT, Tue April 2, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "It feels good to feel Mother Earth beneath my feet," Louis Taylor says
The Pioneer Hotel in Tucson, Arizona, caught fire in 1970, killing 29
Taylor, then 16, was quickly arrested and convicted of arson Modern experts have called the evidence into question
(CNN) -- What is it like to be thrown behind bars when you're 16 and told you'll languish there for the rest of your life, all for a crime you adamantly maintain you didn't commit?
Louis Taylor knows.
He was convicted of arson in a fire that killed 29 people.
But forensic experts now say they can no longer determine whether someone set the hotel fire on that cool winter day in 1970. And on Tuesday, in a Tucson, Arizona, courtroom, he pleaded no contest to the charges in a new hearing and was sentenced to time served -- almost 43 years.
Taylor, now 59 with a shaved head, stood quietly during Tuesday's proceedings. But the son of one of the victims of the disastrous blaze at the Pioneer Hotel left him with a warning.
"I harbor no feelings of ill will or vengeance against you, for my father is now gone and nothing can ever be done to change that fact," Paul D'hedouville II said. "Do as you choose, Mr. Taylor, but choose wisely and do not waste your new beginning at life. The eyes of this courtroom and those beyond these walls, in mind and spirit, will be watching you."
Taylor spoke briefly to reporters after he traded his orange prison garb for a T-shirt and slacks and walked out of prison, saying, "It feels good to feel Mother Earth beneath my feet -- free Mother Earth."
"It's a tale of two tragedies -- the Pioneer Hotel fire, and me getting convicted for it," he said.
A vintage landmark burns
The Pioneer Hotel, built in 1929, was renowned for its gracious ballroom. At 11 floors, it was a protruding gem in downtown Tucson's skyline at the time.
On December 20, 1970, the vintage hotel was filled with guests, and hundreds more were reveling in holiday cheer at a corporate Christmas party.
Just after midnight, a blaze broke out. The landmark building's firefighting measures were badly out of date, and the Pioneer quickly transformed into an inferno.
A morbid spectacle of human tragedy unfolded.
Twenty-eight people died from smoke inhalation, burns, or, in some cases, when they jumped out of windows to escape. The fire wiped out whole families.
Jake Crellin was the first journalist on the scene.
"I still have flashbacks from time to time from some of the stuff I saw, flashbacks of people jumping out of windows to their death," said the former news director of CNN affiliate KVOA.
He avoided looking at the scene with the naked eye, gazing instead through the viewfinder of a camera.
"It helped make it a little easier to watch," he told the affiliate. A crowd of bystanders gathered and looked on in horror.
Some hotel guests were able to knot bed sheets together to make ropes and rappel to safety.
It was one of the deadliest tragedies in Tucson's history.
A quick arrest
Within hours, police arrested a teenage boy, court documents said.
It was Louis Taylor, who had been inside the hotel.
He wasn't a guest and did not work there. And he had books of matches in his pocket.
During police interrogations, the juvenile claimed to have seen someone set the fire. This was before anyone had suspected arson.
But the young man changed his story multiple times.
It made officers suspicious: Maybe it was arson; maybe it was Taylor who started the fire.
Criminal witnesses
Journalist Crellin and KVOA kept up with the case.
Taylor told him that "he had some very tough interviews with the police." He was innocent, he said, a stance he has always maintained.
In an interview on the 25th anniversary of the fire, he told the broadcaster that the fire never goes out of his head.
"I think about it all the time, because I know in my heart and God knows that they got the wrong person. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time."
Prosecutors called two witnesses who were in juvenile detention with Taylor. They told the court that Taylor confessed to the crime to them behind bars.
Later, one of the boys said he had been coerced into his testimony and that it was false, according to court documents.
Experts for the prosecution and the defense testified that the fire, in their opinion, was caused by arson, though the details of their explanations differed.
In the end, Taylor was convicted of 28 counts of felony murder.
Judge Charles Hardy, who presided over the case, told Taylor that he didn't believe he meant to hurt anyone. But the punishment was stiff: "the rest of his natural life in prison," a sentence that at the time did not officially exist in the state of Arizona, a court document said.
In hindsight
Decades later, people involved in the conviction and sentencing began to feel bad about the case.
The CBS investigative magazine "60 Minutes" took up the case.
The judge told the program that, looking back, he would not have voted to convict.
The evidence, he said, was not strong enough. And if the then-teenager did set the fire, it was not Taylor's fault that the hotel was poorly suited to deal with any kind of fire.
Lawyers from the Arizona Justice Project got involved.
The non-profit reviews cases it feels don't live up to just legal standards.
"It is our mission to help assure that Arizona's prisons are not housing those actually innocent of crime or otherwise victims of manifest injustice," reads the mission statement on its website.
The lawyers encouraged the state to review the arson testimony in the original trial based on modern methods.
Two review committees determined that there is no longer enough evidence available to tell whether arson was in play.
They said that the experts in the original trial "used methods no longer valid in the science of today."
One of the original trial experts, Cy Holmes, still a fire investigator four decades later, still stands by his testimony today, a court memorandum filed Monday said. But his testimony can't pin it on Taylor.
CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A man carrying the South Carolina flag mows the lawn at Lincoln Memorial
A food bank feeds hungry furloughed workers at Grand Canyon National Park
An East Coast grocery chain distributes 100,000 gift cards worth $5 each
It takes a billionaire couple to keep Head Start open for low-income toddlers in six states
(CNN) -- Ours is a government of the people, by the people, for the people.
It may be time to add turned over to the people, too -- if the volunteerism of a few kind people, companies and philanthropies is any indication.
As conflict between Congress and the White House has wrought a partial government shutdown, several big-hearted individuals and organizations have stepped forward with time and cash to provide services that Uncle Sam now can't.
Death benefits
It is called the ultimate sacrifice, but a soldier giving his or her life for the United States wasn't prompting the Pentagon to deliver benefits to surviving family members.
Preschoolers shut out by the shutdown No towels at Congress gym amid shutdown
National parks to reopen in Utah
Shutdown threatens veteran benefits
So, stepping in is an organization that few Americans outside the military had heard of until now: the Fisher House Foundation.
The charity operates 62 residences for injured service members and has served 180,000 military families since 1990. It is now guaranteeing surviving relatives "the full set of benefits they have been promised, including a $100,000 death gratuity payment," Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said.
In the meantime, Congress is finalizing an agreement to resume paying survivor benefits, including the $100,000 payment.
$5 gift cards
An East Coast grocery chain on Thursday began distributing $500,000 worth of $5 gift cards to food banks in three cities in North Carolina because the pantries expect long lines in the wake of a suspended federal program serving low-income pregnant women and new mothers with children under age 5.
The suspended federal aid is part of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, called WIC.
The food banks can give the $5 gift cards -- redeemable at Food Lion stores -- to any family in need, said company spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown. Food Lion has 1,100 stores in 10 Eastern states.
"I'm heading right now to the Charlotte food banks," Phillips-Brown said on Thursday afternoon. The other cities to receive the gift cards will be Raleigh and Winston-Salem, she said.
"This is important to us because we don't want families having to choose between paying rent or buying baby formula," she said.
Impoverished preschoolers
It took a billionaire couple to keep Head Start classrooms open for 7,000 low-income children in six states.
Laura and John Arnold are giving $10 million to ensure the early childhood education program remains open in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi.
Head Start provides schooling to 1 million low-income U.S. children under age 5 in an effort to prepare them for kindergarten and subsequent grades. When Head Start programs close, parents often miss work or must find alternative care for their children.
The nonprofit Head Start Association said it will repay the Arnolds if the government, after the shutdown, provides funding to keep programs operational for a year.
Feeding the furloughed
A food bank is coming to the rescue of more than 2,200 workers at one of the shuttered U.S. parks -- the Grand Canyon National Park -- as well as 1,200 employees in the private hospitality sector who depend on an open park for business.
Non-mandated federal employees don't have a paycheck. And workers in nearby hotels and restaurants are also hurt by the loss of tourism.
So, the St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix has begun weekly distribution of emergency food boxes to workers strained by the Grand Canyon's shutdown.
Beverly Damore, president and CEO of the alliance, recalled how one boy found a can of pork and beans in one box. He held it aloft "like a prize," she said in a videotaped statement.
"He was holding it with joy on his face. He so clearly needed that food," Damore said.
She has nevertheless been losing sleep because she didn't note the boy's name, or that of a couple who accepted food and promised to help the food bank when "times are better," she said.
"I do not know how to make those folks in D.C. thousands of miles away stay sleepless with me because they also do not know these fine people," Damore said.
Volunteer lawn mower
The Lincoln Memorial in Washington needed a landscaper, so Chris Cox of Charleston, South Carolina, brought a gas mower and trimmed the grass while holding his home state's flag. The other hand pushed the mower.
The moment was captured on a CNN iReport video by passerby Darrel Stroman, who said: "I get caught at the light and see a man cutting the grass at the Lincoln Memorial. I didn't know what was stranger at the moment -- the fact that he was cutting the lawn or that he was holding the South Carolina state flag while cutting.
"It was a very unusual moment," Stroman said.
Police, however, halted the volunteer landscaper's activities.
"He was asked to leave and he did," said Sgt. Paul Brooks, spokesman for the U.S. Park Police.
Cox was grateful that police didn't ticket or arrest him.
Said Cox: "'At the end of the day, the citizens are stewards of the memorials."

CDC: More states reporting widespread flu By Ashley Hayes, CNN
updated 12:13 PM EST, Fri December 27, 2013
This is an influenza virus particle, also known as a virion, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Virions are made up of an outer protein shell and an inner core of nucleic acid: in this case, eight single-stranded RNA segments. This illustration from the CDC is a 3-D graphical representation of an influenza virion's structure. Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, meaning their virions measure between 80 and 120 nanometers in diameter. Each virion contains hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens, substances that cause our bodies to produce antibodies. The amount of each antigen determines the strain of the virus, which is where the H#N# naming structure comes from. This image depicts a number of influenza A virions. There are three basic types of influenza viruses -- A, B and C -- but only influenza A can infect animals, such as pigs or birds. When a virus strain enters an animal, it may change, causing a more serious epidemic when it returns to humans. In 1997, scientists took lung tissue from five 1918 Spanish flu victims and extracted the nucleic acid to sequence the flu strain's genome. This image shows the re-created influenza virions that caused the outbreak, infecting close to a fifth of the world's population and killing an estimated 30 million to 50 million people in less than a year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
These virions belong to the H3N2 flu virus that started in Hong Kong in 1968, according to the CDC. H3N2 infected an estimated 50 million Americans and killed 33,000 people in the United States, "making it the mildest flu pandemic in the 20th century," according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Mexico and the United States first reported human cases of the H1N1, or swine flu, virus in April 2009, according to the World Health Organization. "Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern," WHO said at the time. The disease spread to more than 200 countries and has caused more than 18,000 deaths since 2009. H1N1 was called "swine flu" because it was similar to the virus seen in pigs, as this photo illustrates. The WHO officially called an end to the H1N1 pandemic in August 2010, but cases with the strain still appear each year. "It is likely that the 2009 H1N1 virus will continue to spread for years to come, like a regular seasonal influenza virus," the CDC says.
The latest flu outbreak started in China in April. H7N9, or Avian Influenza A, was seen in poultry and in people who worked closely with poultry. A few cases of human-to-human transmission were reported, but the virus didn't spread beyond China. The CDC suspects that the virus will return again in the fall as temperatures drop. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Widespread seasonal activity is increasing, the CDC says
The cases appear to be those of a typical season
H1N1 is the primary strain seen; it's no longer called "swine flu"
(CNN) -- The number of states reporting widespread seasonal flu activity jumped from four to 10 last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
Widespread activity was reported in Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming, according to the CDC's weekly flu advisory report, covering the week ending December 21.
The previous week, only Alabama, Louisiana, New York and Texas reported widespread flu.
"Widespread" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. It addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity.
Flu kills five in Texas
However, six states -- Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas -- reported a high proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for flu-like illnesses.
So far, "it's a typical influenza season, if I can use that word," said Dr. Michael Jhung, a medical officer in the CDC's flu division.
The season usually begins in the winter months and peaks in January or February.
The only atypical thing seen this year is that the most common strain has been H1N1, which became known as swine flu during a 2009 outbreak.
"It's the same virus that we saw in 2009 that caused the pandemic," Jhung said. At the time, it was called swine flu since it was seen for the first time in humans.
But since then, "it's established itself very nicely in the human population," Jhung said. "We've seen it every season since 2009 in people." The virus is no longer referred to as swine flu but instead as a human seasonal virus.
The strain is so common that it's included in the flu vaccine, including this year's vaccination, he said.
5 ways to combat flu in your home
Four pediatric flu deaths have been reported since September 29, according to the CDC. The agency does not track adult deaths related to the flu, although some states do, and deaths have been reported.
The exact number of flu-related adult deaths is hard to track and varies from year to year. The CDC has estimated that from 1976 through 2007, between 3,000 and 49,000 people died of flu-related causes.
"It depends on the season; it depends on the virus," Jhung said.
Last year, 381,000 people were hospitalized and 169 children died in what's being called a relatively severe season.
However, the CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 6.6 million illnesses last year, 3.2 million doctor visits and at least 79,000 hospitalizations.
Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older, especially pregnant women and those at high risk of complications, including the elderly, children younger than 5 years and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes.
Antiviral medications are a good treatment if you do get sick, Jhung said, particularly those at high risk for complications. Ideally, antivirals should be started within two days of when symptoms appear.

Typhoid fever
Filed under: Infectious Diseases
Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in industrialized countries. However, it remains a serious health threat in the developing world, especially for children. Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or through close contact with someone who's infected. Signs and symptoms usually include high fever, headache, abdominal pain, and either constipation or diarrhea. When treated with antibiotics, most people with typhoid fever feel better within a few days, although a small percentage of them may die of complications. Vaccines against typhoid fever are available, but they're only partially effective. Vaccines usually are reserved for those who may be exposed to the disease or are traveling to areas where typhoid fever is common. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Symptoms
Although children with typhoid fever sometimes become sick suddenly, signs and symptoms are more likely to develop gradually — often appearing one to three weeks after exposure to the disease. 1st week of illness Once signs and symptoms do appear, you're likely to experience: Fever, that starts low and increases daily, often to as high as 103 or 104 F (39.4 or 40 C)
Headache
Weakness and fatigue
Dry cough
Loss of appetite
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea or constipation
Rash
2nd week of illness If you don't receive treatment for typhoid fever, you may enter a second stage during which you become very ill and experience: Continuing high fever
Either diarrhea or severe constipation
Considerable weight loss
Extremely distended abdomen
3rd week of illness By the third week, you may: Become delirious
Lie motionless and exhausted with your eyes half-closed in what's known as the typhoid state
Life-threatening complications often develop at this time. 4th week of illness Improvement may come slowly during the fourth week. Your fever is likely to decrease gradually until your temperature returns to normal in another week to 10 days. But signs and symptoms can return up to two weeks after your fever has subsided. When to see a doctor See a doctor immediately if you suspect you have typhoid fever. If you become ill while traveling in a foreign country, call the U.S. Consulate for a list of doctors. Better yet, find out in advance about medical care in the areas you'll visit, and carry a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of recommended doctors. If you develop signs and symptoms after you return home, consider consulting a doctor who focuses on international travel medicine or infectious diseases. A specialist may be able to recognize and treat your illness more quickly than can a doctor who isn't trained in these areas. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Causes
Typhoid fever is caused by a virulent bacterium called Salmonella typhi. Although they're related, S. typhi and the bacterium responsible for salmonellosis, another serious intestinal infection, aren't the same. Fecal-oral transmission route The bacteria that cause typhoid fever spread through contaminated food or water and occasionally through direct contact with someone who is infected. In developing nations, where typhoid is endemic, most cases result from contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation. The majority of people in industrialized countries pick up the typhoid bacteria while traveling and spread it to others through the fecal-oral route. This means that S. typhi is passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. You can contract the infection if you eat food handled by someone with typhoid fever who hasn't washed carefully after using the toilet. You can also become infected by drinking water contaminated with the bacteria. Typhoid carriers Even after treatment with antibiotics, a small number of people who recover from typhoid fever continue to harbor the bacteria in their intestinal tracts or gallbladders, often for years. These people, called chronic carriers, shed the bacteria in their feces and are capable of infecting others, although they no longer have signs or symptoms of the disease themselves. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Risk factors
Typhoid fever remains a serious worldwide threat — especially in the developing world — affecting an estimated 22 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is endemic in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and many other areas. Worldwide, children are at greatest risk of getting the disease, although they generally have milder symptoms than adults do. If you live in a country where typhoid fever is rare, you're at increased risk if you: Work in or travel to areas where typhoid fever is endemic
Work as a clinical microbiologist handling Salmonella typhi bacteria
Have close contact with someone who is infected or has recently been infected with typhoid fever
Have an immune system weakened by medications such as corticosteroids or diseases such as HIV/AIDS
Drink water contaminated by sewage that contains S. typhi

Complications
Intestinal bleeding or holes The most serious complication of typhoid fever — intestinal bleeding or holes (perforations) — may develop in the third week of illness. About 5 percent of people with typhoid fever experience this complication. Intestinal bleeding is often marked by a sudden drop in blood pressure and shock, followed by the appearance of blood in your stool. A perforated intestine occurs when your small intestine or large bowel develops a hole, causing intestinal contents to leak into your abdominal cavity and triggering signs and symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and bloodstream infection (sepsis). This life-threatening emergency requires immediate medical care. Other, less common complications Other possible complications include: Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)
Inflammation of the lining of the heart and valves (endocarditis)
Pneumonia
Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis)
Kidney or bladder infections
Infection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meningitis)
Psychiatric problems such as delirium, hallucinations and paranoid psychosis
With prompt treatment, nearly all people in industrialized nations recover from typhoid. Without treatment, some people may not survive complications of the disease. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Preparing for your appointment
Call your doctor if you've recently returned from travel abroad and develop mild symptoms similar to those that occur with typhoid fever. If your symptoms are severe, go to an emergency room or call 911 or your local emergency number. Here's some information to help you get ready and know what to expect from your doctor. Information to gather in advance Pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make your appointment, ask if there are restrictions you need to follow in the time leading up to your visit. Your doctor will not be able to confirm typhoid fever without a blood test, and may recommend taking steps to reduce the risk of passing a possible contagious illness to others.
Symptom history. Write down any symptoms you''re experiencing and for how long.
Recent exposure to possible sources of infection. Be prepared to describe international trips in detail, including the countries you visited and the dates you traveled.
Medical history. Make a list of your key medical information, including other conditions for which you're being treated and any medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking. Your doctor will also need to know your vaccination history.
Questions to ask your doctor. Write down your questions in advance so that you can make the most of your time with your doctor.
For typhoid fever, possible questions to ask your doctor include: What are the possible causes for my symptoms?
What kinds of tests do I need?
Are treatments available to help me recover?
How long do you expect a full recovery will take?
When can I return to work or school?
Am I at risk of any long-term complications from typhoid fever?
Don't hesitate to ask any other related questions you have. What to expect from your doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to talk about in-depth. Your doctor may ask: What are your symptoms?
When did you begin experiencing symptoms?
Have your symptoms gotten better or worse?
Did your symptoms briefly get better and then come back?
Have you recently traveled abroad? Where?
Did you update your vaccinations before traveling?
Are you being treated for any other medical conditions?
Are you currently taking any medications?

Tests and diagnosis
Medical and travel history Your doctor is likely to suspect typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history. But the diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying S. typhi in a culture of your blood or other body fluid or tissue. Body fluid or tissue culture For the culture, a small sample of your blood, stool, urine or bone marrow is placed on a special medium that encourages the growth of bacteria. In 48 to 72 hours, the culture is checked under a microscope for the presence of typhoid bacteria. A bone marrow culture often is the most sensitive test for S. typhi. Although performing a culture test is the mainstay for diagnosis, in some instances other testing may be used to confirm a suspected typhoid infection, such as a test to detect antibodies to typhoid bacteria in your blood or a test that checks for typhoid DNA in your blood. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Treatments and drugs
Antibiotic therapy is the only effective treatment for typhoid fever. Commonly prescribed antibiotics Ciprofloxacin (Cipro). In the United States, doctors often prescribe this for nonpregnant adults.
Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). This injectable antibiotic is an alternative for women who are pregnant and for children who may not be candidates for ciprofloxacin. These drugs can cause side effects, and long-term use can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Problems with antibiotic resistance In the past, the drug of choice was chloramphenicol. Doctors no longer commonly use it, however, because of side effects, a high rate of health deterioration after a period of improvement (relapse), and widespread bacterial resistance. In fact, the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in the treatment of typhoid, especially in the developing world. In recent years, S. typhi also has proved resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. Supportive therapy
Other treatment steps aimed at managing symptoms include: Drinking fluids. This helps prevent the dehydration that results from a prolonged fever and diarrhea. If you're severely dehydrated, you may need to receive fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously).
Eating a healthy diet. Nonbulky, high-calorie meals can help replace the nutrients you lose when you're sick.

Prevention
In many developing nations, the public health goals that can help prevent and control typhoid — safe drinking water, improved sanitation and adequate medical care — may be difficult to achieve. For that reason, some experts believe that vaccinating high-risk populations is the best way to control typhoid fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends being vaccinated if you''re traveling to areas where the risk of getting typhoid fever is high. Vaccines Two vaccines are available. One is injected in a single dose about two weeks before exposure.
One is given orally in four capsules, with one capsule to be taken every other day.
Neither vaccine is 100 percent effective, and both require repeat immunizations as vaccine effectiveness diminishes over time. Because the vaccine won't provide complete protection, follow these guidelines when traveling to high-risk areas as well: Wash your hands. Frequent hand-washing is the best way to control infection. Wash your hands thoroughly with hot, soapy water, especially before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for times when water isn't available.
Avoid drinking untreated water. Contaminated drinking water is a particular problem in areas where typhoid is endemic. For that reason, drink only bottled water or canned or bottled carbonated beverages, wine and beer. Carbonated bottled water is safer than uncarbonated bottled water is. Wipe the outside of all bottles and cans before you open them. Ask for drinks without ice. Use bottled water to brush your teeth, and try not to swallow water in the shower.
Avoid raw fruits and vegetables. Because raw produce may have been washed in unsafe water, avoid fruits and vegetables that you can't peel, especially lettuce. To be absolutely safe, you may want to avoid raw foods entirely.
Choose hot foods. Avoid food that's stored or served at room temperature. Steaming hot foods are best. And although there's no guarantee that meals served at the finest restaurants are safe, it's best to avoid food from street vendors — it's more likely to be contaminated.
Prevent infecting others If you're recovering from typhoid, these measures can help keep others safe: Wash your hands often. This is the single most important thing you can do to keep from spreading the infection to others. Use plenty of hot, soapy water and scrub thoroughly for at least 30 seconds, especially before eating and after using the toilet.
Clean household items daily. Clean toilets, door handles, telephone receivers and water taps at least once a day with a household cleaner and paper towels or disposable cloths.
Avoid handling food. Avoid preparing food for others until your doctor says you're no longer contagious. If you work in the food service industry or a health care facility, you won't be allowed to return to work until tests show that you're no longer shedding typhoid bacteria.
Keep personal items separate. Set aside towels, bed linen and utensils for your own use and wash them frequently in hot, soapy water. Heavily soiled items can be soaked first in disinfectant.
