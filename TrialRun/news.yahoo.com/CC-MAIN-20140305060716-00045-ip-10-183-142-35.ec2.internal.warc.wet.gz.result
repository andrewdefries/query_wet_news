A new species of marine fish, illustrated here, was discovered in Teruel, Spain and lived more than 400 …
The fossilized remains of a 408-million-year-old fish species have been found in Spain, a study reports.	Researchers found scales, spines and shoulder bones of the new species (Machaeracanthus goujeti) in the town of Teruel and to the south of the city of Zaragoza. The fish lived during the Devonian period, and is a spiny shark (Acanthodii), an extinct type of fish that resembles both sharks and bony fish.	The discovery "expands our knowledge of the biodiversity that existed on the peninsula 408 million years ago, when the modern-day region of Teruel was covered by the sea," study researcher Héctor Botella, a paleontologist at the University of Valencia, Spain, said in a statement.	Little is known about the spiny sharks, other than that they only lived during the Palaeozoic Era (540 million to 250 million years ago) and really blossomed during the Devonian period (420 million to 360 million years ago).	But bones in the spiny shark group usually grow differently than the ones found here, suggesting the new species might be even more like sharks and arose during the diversification of jawed vertebrates.	Most of the fossil samples were from juveniles. The researchers estimate the biggest of these fish would have been less than a meter (3.3 feet) long.	The fossils were found in sediment layers in the Iberian mountains. They were probably from fish that lived in a large but shallow saltwater body of water known as an epicontinental sea, the researchers say, which might have served as a breeding ground. Larger fossils were found in lower sediment layers.	The researchers also analyzed fossils from the Lower Devonian period in northern Spain and western France, which were first thought to come from the Machaeracanthus species.	The new fossils are now kept in the Paleontology Museum of Zaragoza, Spain. The findings were reported in the December 2012 issue of the journal Geodiversitas.

AP Source: Sen. Chambliss won't seek re-election

WASHINGTON (AP) — Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss will not run for a third term next year, avoiding a likely fight with the tea party for the Republican nomination, a congressional aide said Friday.Chambliss, 69, has been a GOP loyalist for much of his House and Senate career, but he earned the wrath of some in his party for participating in a bipartisan Senate "Gang of Six" intent on finding a way to reduce the deficit. The group advocated a mix of tax increases, anathema for many in the GOP, and spending cuts. The group failed to reach agreement and produce a bargain.Although no major Republican candidate had announced a challenge to Chambliss, he was facing the distinct possibility of a tough race.Chambliss was expected to make a formal announcement. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak in advance of an official statement.Chambliss's decision is certain to set off a GOP scramble for the seat.Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., an 11-term House veteran, said he was considering seeking the seat. Kingston, 57, said his knowledge of defense and agriculture, important issues in Georgia, would help him in a race."Regardless of what happens, it's going to be a 10-person race," Kingston said in a telephone interview from Israel, where he was traveling with other lawmakers. "And I think you'll probably have a self-funder in there, and you can have a mad scramble."Among other potential Republican candidates are four-term Rep. Tom Price from a district north of Atlanta. Pizza mogul Herman Cain, the failed presidential candidate in 2012 and a tea party favorite, may again set his sights on the Senate seat after running in 2004.Chambliss was first elected to the House in the 1994 Republican wave. He moved up to the Senate after a bruising 2002 campaign in which he defeated Democratic incumbent Max Cleland, a triple amputee from his Vietnam war service.He was criticized for a slashing campaign against Cleland that included an ad, featuring terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, that criticized the Democrat — a decorated Vietnam War veteran — for his record on defense and homeland security issues. Even some of Chambliss' fellow Republicans said it went too far.Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Democrats will try to win back the seat."Georgia will now offer Democrats one of our best pick-up opportunities of the cycle. There are already several reports of the potential for a divisive primary that will push Republicans to the extreme right. Regardless, there's no question that the demographics of the state have changed, and Democrats are gaining strength. This will be a top priority."Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate but will be defending more seats next year — 20 to the GOP's 13. Democrats will be scrambling to hold onto the seat in GOP-leaning West Virginia, where five-term Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller recently announced he would not seek re-election. Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito is running for the Senate seat.Democratic incumbents also face tough re-election races in Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina and Alaska — all states that went Republican in the last presidential election.An open seat in Georgia, which has trended Republican, presents a legitimate opportunity for Democrats, especially if the GOP faces a divisive primary. Potential Democratic candidates are conservative Rep. John Barrow, who has survived redistricting in his House races, and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.Other possible Republican candidates are two other House members — Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, both physicians. Broun gained national attention last year when he described evolution as a lie "from the pit of Hell." Gingrey claimed the spotlight earlier this month when he defended controversial statements about abortion made last year by failed Missouri Senate hopeful Todd Akin.___Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Alan Fram in Washington and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.Politics & GovernmentElectionsSaxby ChamblissGOPGOPRepublican

"They were bred to look for trouble so they're always on their toes out there," Westminster Kennel Club Director of Communications and longtime WKC Dog Show TV co-host David Frei said of the terrier breed. "It's their world and we're just living in it and I think that gives them a little extra edge in the show ring."Frei appeared on " Good Morning America" today along with Sky, who proved to be frisky and friendly during her morning show appearance."She's got this little extra something, as you can see," Frei said.Sky has won 129 best in show awards and was ranked as the country's No. 1 show dog last year."This is just another day at the office for her," said Frei.Sky topped the 2,845 dogs entered in the show. They were eligible in 190 breeds and varieties. The standard poodle named Ally was chosen as the runner-up."They couldn't have this kind of success if they didn't love it," Frei said of the dogs who competed.Sky's owners are Victor Malzoni Jr. and Torie Steele, and her handlers are Gabriel and Ivonne Rangel. An overjoyed Gabriel Rangel stood with Sky following Tuesday's title."I'm so proud of her. … There's no words to describe this," he told a reporter with USA Network, which broadcast the show.Beyond the dog show circuit, Sky knows how to have fun, too. In July, she was photographed wearing a shaggy wig and tinted glasses.She even has a Twitter account - @Skywirefox.According to the Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., Sky's owners plan to retire her following Tuesday's title.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Braxton's autistic son stars with her in new movie

NEW YORK (AP) — Toni Braxton's autistic son makes his acting debut in her new Lifetime movie, "Twist of Faith," and could have had a bigger role, but the singer didn't want to put too much pressure on him."He was supposed to play my son initially but by the time we worked out the shooting schedule, school had started," Braxton said of 9-year-old Diezel. (She also has an 11-year-old named Denim.)"Even though he's considered high functioning right now, he wasn't in the past, and that's why I thought him carrying the movie and trying to do the movie and tutoring would have been too much for him," the 45-year-old singer said.Braxton decided he should take a smaller role."He was a little disappointed at first, but I think in the end, he's happy about the turnout," she said.Braxton understands the pressure. Although she has had small acting roles and stars in the WE reality TV series, "Braxton Family Values," which has its season premiere March 14, she is the main star of "Twist of Faith" — and that makes her nervous.

"I never had to carry anything before. It's a lot of work," she said of her role in the film, which debuts Saturday on Lifetime (8 p.m. EST)."Singing is indigenous for me, but acting is not. I've had to work to prepare for it," said Braxton, adding later: "Be nice to me, guys! This is my first real acting debut! There are a few boo-boos. ... It's a lot more technical than I thought."Braxton is better known for her Grammy-winning, multiplatinum singing career, which has netted classics like "Un-break My Heart" and "Breathe Again." She said she's working on an album with longtime collaborator Babyface called "Love, Marriage, Divorce." She's also doing a few shows here and there, but she suffers from lupus, an autoimmune disease, which prevents her from doing more. Recently, she was hospitalized for blood clots, but Braxton considers herself one of the "lucky ones" and is grateful she can still have a career."My doctors told me I would never be able to perform again," she said. "I'm very lucky that I'm still able to dabble in it a little bit."___Online:http://www.Tonibraxton.comhttp://www.mylifetime.comhttp://www.wetv.com/shows/braxton-family-values___Follow Nekesa Mumbi Moody at http://www.twitter.com/nekesamumbiArts & EntertainmentMediaToni BraxtonBraxton Family Values

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Whole Foods Market Inc. said Tuesday that net income rose 20 percent in its fiscal second quarter, and it raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year. Whole Foods also said it will conduct a two-for-one stock split at the end of May. Net income for the three months ended April 14 was $142 million, or 76 cents per share. A year ago Whole Foods made $118 million, or 64 cents per share. Revenue grew 13 percent, to $3.03 billion. Analysts expected 73 cents per share on $3.04 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. Whole Foods said revenue from stores open at least a year grew 6.9 percent. Results from stores open at least a year are an important measure of retailer performance because they exclude results from locations that opened or closed recently. Whole Foods has 349 stores in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. It expects to open 32 stores in the current fiscal year and 33 to 38 more in fiscal 2014. The company is now forecasting net income of $2.86 to $2.89 per share for the fiscal year, up from $2.83 to $2.87 per share. Analysts expect net income of $2.87 per share, on average. Whole Foods' board approved a two-for-one stock split that will double the company's share count to about 370 million. The company said shareholders of record on May 17 will get a stock dividend on May 29, receiving one new share for every share they own. The shares will start trading at post-split price on May 30. Whole Foods' current annual guidance does not reflect the stock split. Shares of Whole Foods Market jumped by $7.40, or 8 percent, to $100.20 in after-hours trading. The stock picked up $1 to close at $92.80 in the regular session. Consumer DiscretionaryInvestment & Company Information
