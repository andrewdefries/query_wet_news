Analysis: NKorea threat may be more bark than bite

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Across North Korea, soldiers are gearing up for battle and shrouding their jeeps and vans with camouflage netting. Newly painted signboards and posters call for "death to the U.S. imperialists" and urge the people to fight with "arms, not words."But even as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is issuing midnight battle cries to his generals to ready their rockets, he and his million-man army know full well that a successful missile strike on U.S. targets would be suicide for the outnumbered, out-powered North Korean regime.Despite the hastening drumbeat of warfare — seemingly bringing the region to the very brink of conflict with threats and provocations — Pyongyang aims to force Washington to the negotiating table, pressure the new president in Seoul to change policy on North Korea, and build unity inside the country without triggering a full-blown war.North Korea wants to draw attention to the tenuousness of the armistice designed to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula, a truce Pyongyang recently announced it would no longer honor as it warned that war could break out at any time.In July, it will be 60 years since North Korea and China signed an armistice with the U.S. and the United Nations to bring an end to three years of fighting that cost millions of lives. The designated Demilitarized Zone has evolved into the most heavily guarded border in the world.It was never intended to be a permanent border. But six decades later, North and South remain divided, with Pyongyang feeling abandoned by the South Koreans in the quest for reunification and threatened by the Americans.In that time, South Korea has blossomed from a poor, agrarian nation of peasants into the world's 15th largest economy while North Korea is struggling to find a way out of a Cold War chasm that has left it with a per capita income on par with sub-Saharan Africa.The Chinese troops who fought alongside the North Koreans have long since left. But 28,500 American troops are still stationed in South Korea and 50,000 more are in nearby Japan. For weeks, the U.S. and South Korea have been showing off their military might with a series of joint exercises that Pyongyang sees a rehearsal for invasion.On Thursday, the U.S. military confirmed that those drills included two nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers that can unload the U.S. Air Force's largest conventional bomb — a 30,000-pound super bunker buster — powerful enough to destroy North Korea's web of underground military tunnels.It was a flexing of military muscle by Washington, perhaps aimed not only at Pyongyang but at Beijing as well.In Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un reacted swiftly, calling an emergency meeting of army generals and ordering them to be prepared to strike if the U.S. actions continue. A photo distributed by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency showed Kim in a military operations room with maps detailing a "strike plan" behind him in a very public show of supposedly sensitive military strategy.The head of Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the Federal Intelligence Service, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that North Korea's aggressive rhetoric is "not completely new," citing past provocations."To sum up: we assume that North Korea does not want a war," Gerhard Schindler was quoted as saying.North Korea cites the U.S. military threat as a key reason behind its need to build nuclear weapons, and has poured a huge chunk of its small national budget into defense, science and technology. In December, scientists launched a satellite into space on the back of a long-range rocket using technology that could easily be converted for missiles; in February, they tested an underground nuclear device as part of a mission to build a bomb they can load on a missile capable of reaching the U.S.However, what North Korea really wants is legitimacy in the eyes of the U.S. — and a peace treaty. Pyongyang wants U.S. troops off Korean soil, and the bombs and rockets are more of an expensive, dangerous safety blanket than real firepower. They are the only real playing card North Korea has left, and the bait they hope will bring the Americans to the negotiating table.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said North Korea's "bellicose rhetoric" would only deepen its international isolation, and that the U.S. has both the capability and willingness to defend its interests in the region.Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, isn't convinced North Korea is capable of attacking Guam, Hawaii or the U.S. mainland. He says Pyongyang hasn't successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.But its medium-range Rodong missiles, with a range of about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers), are "operational and credible" and could reach U.S. bases in Japan, he says.More likely than such a strike, however, is a smaller-scale incident, perhaps off the Koreas' western coast, that would not provoke the Americans to unleash their considerable firepower. For years, the waters off the west coast have been a battleground for naval skirmishes between the two Koreas because the North has never recognized the maritime border drawn unilaterally by the U.N.As threatening as Kim's call to arms may sound, its main target audience may be the masses at home in North Korea.For months, the masterminds of North Korean propaganda have pinpointed this year's milestone Korean War anniversary as a prime time to play up Kim's military credibility as well as to push for a peace treaty. By creating the impression that a U.S. attack is imminent, the regime can foster a sense of national unity and encourage the people to rally around their new leader.Inside Pyongyang, much of the military rhetoric feels like theatrics. It's not unusual to see people toting rifles in North Korea, where soldiers and checkpoints are a fixture in the heavily militarized society. But more often than not in downtown Pyongyang, the rifle stashed in a rucksack is a prop and the "soldier" is a dancer, one of the many performers rehearsing for a Korean War-themed extravaganza set to debut later this year.More than 100,000 soldiers, students and ordinary workers were summoned Friday to Kim Il Sung Square in downtown Pyongyang to pump their fists in support of North Korea's commander in chief. But elsewhere, it was business as usual at restaurants and shops, and farms and factories, where the workers have heard it all before."Tensions rise almost every year around the time the U.S.-South Korean drills take place, but as soon as those drills end, things go back to normal and people put those tensions behind them quite quickly," said Sung Hyun-sang, the South Korean president of a clothing maker operating in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. "I think and hope that this time won't be different."And in a telling sign that even the North Koreans don't expect war, the national airline, Air Koryo, is adding flights to its spring lineup and preparing to host the scores of tourists they hope will flock to Pyongyang despite the threats issuing forth from the Supreme Command.War or no war, it seems Pyongyang remains open for business.___Lee is chief of AP's bureaus in Pyongyang, North Korea, and Seoul, South Korea.

Who will be the next Sarah Palin at the GOP convention?

Sarah Palin, the star of the 2008 Republican convention, will be in Arizona this week. So who will take her place in Tampa as the breakout star of the GOP’s big show?
View photo.800px-SarahPalinElonRight now, it looks like the big attention-getter in Tampa could be Hurricane Isaac. But there are at least five young Republican stars who could grab the spotlight.
Palin confirmed on Saturday she’ll be in Arizona and some other locations campaigning for congressional candidates.
Just four years ago, Palin was the breakout star in Minneapolis with her surprise nomination by John McCain followed by a powerful speech.
Today, Palin isn’t in Tampa after she wasn’t selected as a speaker by nominee Mitt Romney’s team. But the former Alaska governor remains a force, talking more about the potential need for a third party in an interview on Fox News over the weekend.
Palin is also talking up her hand-picked Senate candidate in Missouri, Sarah Steelman, to take on Todd Akin for a second time, after Akin’s comments on rape created a national firestorm.
During the vice presidential selection process, at least four names kept popping up as new national faces of the Republican party. A Tea Party-backed senate candidate also emerged as a potential star.
Historically, national political conventions can make or break the long-term political hopes of potential candidates.
The term “dark horse” got its name in political lore at the 1844 Democratic convention when James Knox Polk, who had just lost two gubernatorial races in Tennessee, walked away with the presidential nomination, after he benefitted from a deadlocked convention. (Polk had shown up to try for a spot as vice president.)
At the 1956 Democratic party, the star was a young senator who lost a battle for the vice presidential nomination.
John F. Kennedy lost in an open ballot on the floor to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, but the convention appearance was Kennedy’s springboard to the 1960 presidential nomination.
Ronald Reagan spoke at seven GOP conventions, and made a strong national impression in 1968 when he asked delegates to approve Richard Nixon’s nomination. Also, his 1976 speech was seen as a springboard to a 1980 election victory.
In 2004 Barack Obama, then a little-known Illinois state senator, stole the show at the Democratic convention as the keynote speaker.
Five convention speakers to watch
Because the GOP convention is now a three-day affair due to weather in Tampa, expect a lot of speakers to be jammed into the proceedings.
Paul Ryan, 42, the presumptive GOP vice presidential nominee, will get the most attention. Critics and supporters have started with comparisons of Ryan and Palin. Ryan is an experienced public speaker who has been on the campaign trail honing his skills.
Chris Christie, 49, the colorful New Jersey governor, is the keynote speaker, and he’s said he won’t be holding anything back on the podium. Christie is also a close Romney associate widely talked about as a 2016 presidential contender if Romney loses.
Marco Rubio, 41, is also another high-profile speaker with ties to Romney. The senator from Florida will likely get a primetime spot in his home state. Rubio is also another name already tossed into the 2016 presidential race.
Two lesser-known names could steal the show, depending on when—or if–they speak.
Ted Cruz, 41, a charismatic Tea Party favorite who is also the favorite in the senate race in Texas, was to speak on Monday night.
And Kelly Ayotte, 44, the fast-rising senator from New Hampshire, was set to speak early Tuesday night, but that is now up in the air.
Among the people from Monday night who were rescheduled are Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, John Boehner, and Jeb Bush.
Cruz and Ayotte were moved to slots on Wednesday night.
And Condoleezza Rice keeps her primetime spot on Wednesday night in the last hour of the convention that night.
A wild card at the convention is Wednesday, the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The National Weather Service now has New Orleans under a Hurricane Watch. The storm could barrel into the same region devastated by Katrina.
In 2012, the GOP cancelled the day of its convention when Hurricane Gustav was in the Gulf.
For now, Paul Ryan is the featured speaker on Wednesday night.
Isaac certainly has the potential to rain on the parade of the next young GOP star who wants to grab Sarah Palin’s spotlight from 2008.
