Obama Inauguration's Big Donor Packages Previewed

The biggest donors to President Barack Obama's second inauguration have been notified on what benefits will be available to them during that day's festivities.Corporations and other organizations that donate in the highest bracket - $1 million - will have access to a children's concert, "benefactors reception," and four tickets to the official inaugural ball, among other perks. The bonuses were outlined in a solicitation from the Presidential Inaugural Committee to potential donors, and provided to the New York Times by an Obama fundraiser.Private individuals who contribute the legal maximum of $250,000 will be given the same offerings as the million dollar donation from an "institution." Institutions can include corporations, unions, charities, and other organizations.The benefits are separated into four individual "packages," each corresponding to the level of donation. Each is named after a former president: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison; a copy of the solicitation can be found here. As reported by ABC News on Friday, the inaugural committee has reversed a voluntary ban on the donor money, imposed by Obama on the inauguration four years ago and during the 2012 Democratic National Convention.The decision on inauguration funding appears to be influenced by financial challenges left over from this election season's historic campaign spending. According to the Federal Election Commission, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney each raised more than $1 billion. To contrast, Obama's 2009 inaugural cost $47 million.Taxpayers pay for the "official" events of any presidential inauguration: the actual swearing-in on Capitol Hill and inaugural luncheon. But all other events, including balls and the parade itself, must be funded by the president-elect and private donations.This kind of financing is not new in Washington. President George W. Bush's 2005 inaugural, for example, had similar arrangements for donors including Time Warner, Wachovia, Home Depot, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. and Pfizer Inc., at $250,000 each. But this year's reversal is another departure from the pledges then-candidate Obama made during the 2008 election to keep certain kinds of political fundraising away from the Oval Office.During his reelection Obama dropped long-standing opposition to Super PAC's in the face of the most expensive election in U.S. history. And previously in the 2008 campaign he broke a pledge to use public financing for the general election, again citing costs.Committee officials say they will thoroughly vet any contributions and deny those from lobbyists, but some government watchdog groups are assailing the decision regardless."The administration asks to be judged in comparison to Bush, saying their record speaks for itself," the Sunlight Foundation's John Wonderlich said of Obama's record on transparency. "At some point, though, it's time to judge Obama in his own words. Obama said unlimited donations sully our democracy, threaten public service, and weaken representation - and has now chosen to embrace them."Politics & GovernmentElectionsPresident Barack Obama

View photo.A fly lands on President Barack Obama while he speaks in the White House (Larry Downing/Reuters)Three days into President Barack Obama's second term and it's clear he's not the man he was in his first term. Just ask the fly.
A pesky Musca domestica (per pooler Brian Beutler of Talking Points Memo) landed on the president's face during a press conference Thursday to announce his picks to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Obama swatted at the fly a couple of times, and the official White House transcript records, "This guy is bothering me here—(swatting at a fly.)"
The insect eventually left the commander in chief alone.
But the Obama of just a few years ago—of June 2009, to be precise—might not be impressed. That's because that Obama successfully killed a fly during an interview with CNBC, boasting, "I got the sucker."

Building a Better Lobster Trap

Lifting a lobster casita is easier than it looks. The device is little more than an underwater cement table on stumpy legs that most people in the Caribbean use in place of lobster traps. To collect the spiny lobsters native to the area, you simply plant your feet in the sand, take a breath, duck into the four-foot-deep water, and flip up the trap. “You have to keep it from falling backwards!” says Mexican fisheries expert Kim Ley Cooper in exasperation. “Ah, there’s too much sand to see anything.” A small ripple had grabbed the platform like a sail, pushed it vertical and lifted my furiously kicking feet out of the sand like I was a rag doll. In the moment before my feet lifted, I saw the casita’s inhabitant scuttle past to freedom. Casitas (or “little houses”) are found in lobster fisheries throughout Latin America and parts of Australia. The idea is simple: because spiny lobsters crave shelter, covered structures attract them just as well as baited traps. They require little maintenance, are easy to monitor and yield as many if not more lobsters as conventional traps. Their effectiveness, however, has led them to become a flash point among Florida fishing communities. Illegal versions—historically made simply of metallic or appliance garbage dumped in the shallows—have given the device a bad reputation in the U.S. A dedicated cadre of dive fishermen, however, are calling for cleaner versions (like those typically used in Mexico) to be legalized, arguing they are friendlier to the environment than conventional traps. But fishers are not convinced and worry that the devices are so effective (pdf) that they may forever change a marine way of life. All this leaves scientists to wrestle with the question: What’s the best way to catch a lobster? Spiny lobsters, which live in the Caribbean and along the Pacific coast, are very different from iconic Maine lobsters. The latter American species—with massive claws that diners struggle to crack in restaurants—live in cold, dark water and are aggressive toward one another. Spiny lobsters have no claws, forage at night and happily congregate during the day under whatever they can find—be it rocks, coral or debris. In fact, spiny lobsters are so friendly that any piece of cover quickly becomes a magnet for them; they will pack themselves carapace-to-carapace into a crawl space in a matter of weeks, even though they could come and go as they please. Fishermen then simply dive to the shelter and reach in with a sort of metal lasso to snatch them out. Lobsters today are unquestionably the biggest fishery in the Caribbean. Thanks to a hungry Chinese market, the crustacean fetched as much as $18.50 per pound at one point last year for live spiny lobsters. (The U.S. only eats spiny lobsters that have been frozen.) Florida fishermen alone catch more than five million pounds per year, mostly around the Keys. In U.S. waters lobsters are caught in conventional traps, cages with one-way entrances and a long rope for hauling up the catch. With so many traps in the sea, some get loose from their buoys and become tangled in coral or bump around aimlessly. As much as 1,600 kilometers of rope is thought to be lost from traps every year. “Lobsters are the highest value species in the entire Caribbean,” says Tom Matthews of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. But “there are far too many traps used in Florida than what would be needed to harvest all the lobster.” Matthews has been looking at casitas as a potential companion to traps in the U.S. In a recent (unpublished) study he showed that in one lobster-rich area in the Florida Keys, casitas enabled fishermen to collect the same volume in one month that trappers could catch in three. But trap fishermen say that many of these casitas are little more than junk piles. “Car hoods, PVC pipe, corrugated metal sheets, appliances, bathtubs. God, I’ve even seen boat trailers out there,” says Bill Kelly, executive director of the Florida Keys Commercial Fishermen’s Association. “On the Gulf side, roughly five to six miles off in some areas, we have continuous walls of casitas that extend for miles.” Casita fishing has been illegal in the U.S. since the 1980s when illegal fishermen made junk-pile casitas, which during storms can cut coral reefs to ribbons. That’s the image that most people have of casitas but in the past decade improved designs have emerged, and with them a devout group of U.S. fans of the little houses. “It’s the 21st century, why are we still using an archaic 1940s box?” says Jim Sharpe, director of pro-casita Environmentally Concerned Commercial Divers, based in Big Pine Key, Fla. “We’ve got a better mousetrap.” Sharpe says the days of junked refrigerator casitas are long gone and that modern versions are attached to the ocean floor and thus can’t be blown onto the reef during a storm. Many even have a place to clip a boat line so that fishermen do not need an anchor, which also could otherwise damage reefs. Traps require bait (often other lobster), but casitas do not, which means smaller lobsters that might have been bait can go on to breed or be harvested later. And lastly, lobsters left in a trap that has separated from its mooring will eventually die, doing no good for either fisherman or the environment. For retrieval, however, free divers must swim to depths as far as nine meters to retrieve lobsters by hand. That free-diving component, irrelevant with trap lobstering, is key to why conventional lobstermen see casitas as a threat to their livelihoods. “We have no interest in a casita fishery,” Kelly says. “We have a traditional trap fishery that serves the industry well.” The conflict has become remarkably heated. The legal standing of casitas in the U.S. may depend on whether they cause less environmental harm than traps do. Both do some damage: Scientists have known for awhile that casitas form a halo of unvegetated sand around them. But careful examination reveals that traps do as well, and might even be worse because they can swing 15 meters in a circle, damaging ocean life. In addition to operational traps, Matthews (who doesn’t promote one fishing method over another) says that based on surveys of professional lobstermen as many as 100,000 traps are lost every year—a fifth of all traps, posing a threat to reefs and wasting any lobsters caught in them. Kelley says that number is about five times too high but was not able to provide data. If Matthews is right (he plans to publish two papers on the matter soon), it could mean that traps are causing far more damage to the corals than previously thought. Ley Cooper, with NGO Razonatura, which works to empower coastal communities throughout the Yucatan Peninsula, sees casitas as an easy solution to the problem. As long as fishing grounds are divvied up fairly and fishermen are forbidden from using scuba, casitas are the most sustainable way (pdf), he says, to catch lobster. (Mexican divers must free dive and thus do not harvest breeding lobsters from deeper water, unlike other countries such as Honduras, where the lobster population has plummeted because scuba divers take everything.) Either way, we in the U.S. won’t see a casita-based fishery soon. Last summer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ended an investigation into their potential, effectively shutting the door on legal casitas for now “Managing lobsters is easy,” Matthews says. “It’s managing people that’s difficult. Culturally, I would say that casitas are not compatible with south Florida. However, culture can change.” Follow Scientific American on Twitter @SciAm and @SciamBlogs.

May Day rally turns violent in Seattle

.Raw: May Day Turns Violent in Seattle
SEATTLE (AP) — Police used "flash bangs" and pepper spray against some protesters who pelted them with rocks and bottles late Wednesday, as violence erupted during May Day in Seattle.Several dozen protesters, many using bandanas to cover their faces, began clashing with police in downtown Seattle hours after a peaceful immigrant-rights march ended.Protesters threw rocks and bottles at police officers and news crews. As they moved through downtown Seattle to another nearby neighborhood, they flung construction street barriers, trash cans and newspaper bins on the streets in an attempt to block advancing police officers. Windows of local businesses were broken and vehicles with people in them were banged around."We're a bigger and better city than this. I look at this and I am disappointed that this is the picture the world sees of us," Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn said late Wednesday.Police used their bikes to shield businesses and eventually began to use pepper spray and "flash bang' grenades — releasing a flash of light, smoke and a loud noise — to disperse the crowd. But that pushed the group to the Capitol Hill neighborhood, and they left a wake of overturned trash cans and debris on the street, as well as smashed windows on local businesses.In the aftermath, 18 people were arrested, the Seattle Police Capt. Chris Fowler said.Fowler said that eight officer were injured, mostly scrapes and bruises. One officer was hit by a rock on her knee. The violence stemmed from a march that billed itself as an "anti-capitalism" protest. Initially, the protesters concentrated on a business sector of downtown Seattle.Despite lacking a permit to march, Seattle police escorted them as through downtown."That first march came downtown. It was absolutely peaceful...it was almost a festive affair and they had some serious messages, too, that they wanted to express. No incidents whatsoever," McGinn said. "The second march was very different, and it wasn't just merely because it was unpermitted. I think it also had to do with the nature of the individuals in it and what they wanted to do."There were no immediate cost estimates of the damage left.This is the second year in a row violence has broken out during May Day in Seattle. Last year, anarchists broke windows of store fronts, including Niketown, and vehicles and used smoke bombs. Protesters also targeted a federal building, breaking windows and doors.Olivia One Feather of Covington joined the crowd Wednesday night because she wanted to see how police handled the protest. She said she wasn't impressed, adding that she was pepper sprayed in the face while trying to video record officers.Of the protesters, she said, "They're doing what we need to do to stand up to ourselves. These are our streets and we have the right to take them."Many of the protesters are self-described anarchists. A local anarchist website said protesters would attempt to disrupt May Day.After the clashes died down, local residents were seen cleaning up trash left by the protesters.The violence marred a May Day that immigrant-rights activists hoped would put a focus back on immigration reform. Thousands of people marched about 2 1/2 miles from the Central District toward Seattle's downtown Jackson Federal Building after a May Day rally supporting immigrant rights and labor.Many carried signs, with messages such as "We are America," and "There are no illegal humans." One sign suggested forgetting about marijuana and instead asking the United States to "Legalize my mom," a reference to Washington's recent legalization of marijuana.Other demonstrations and rallies in Olympia, Mount Vernon, Spokane, Vancouver, Walla Walla, Wenatchee and Yakima went along peacefully.____Associated Press writers Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Wash., Shannon Dininny in Yakima, Wash. and Manuel Valdes in Seattle contributed to this story.Unrest, Conflicts & WarPolitics & GovernmentSeattle Police

The Simple Thing Pope Francis Did to a Severely Disfigured Man That Has Captivated the World

Pope Francis took the time Wednesday to do one simple thing that has now captivated the globe: He embraced and prayed with a man covered in tumors in St. Peter's Square.
The encounter between the pontiff and the unnamed individual reportedly took place after Francis addressed his general audience, when the man approached the Catholic leader and asked to be blessed.

The man reportedly suffers from neurofibromatosis, which according to the Mayo Clinic is a "genetic disorder that disturbs cell growth in your nervous system, causing tumors to form on nerve tissue." It is not contagious.
While individuals with neurofibromatosis are sometimes shunned because of their appearance, Francis wasted no time kissing the man's face, embracing him and offering up a blessing.

The response to the pontiff's action was strong, with The Washington Post noting that it reminded some of Matthew 8, a Bible chapter in which Jesus heals a leper. And there's also his namesake St. Francis Assisi, the 13th century Catholic friar who was said to have once kissed a leper.

Among those commending the pope was the star of "The Middle" and "Everybody Loves Raymond," actress Patricia Heaton. Heaton, a Christian, tweeted, "How much do I love (Pope Francis)? SO much."
