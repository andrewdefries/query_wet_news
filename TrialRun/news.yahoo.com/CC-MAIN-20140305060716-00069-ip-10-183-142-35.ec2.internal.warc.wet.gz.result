Before the Beatles played six songs in two sets before 73 million Americans on the Feb. 9, 1964, "Ed Sullivan Show," the secret was already out. The group’s biggest hit at that moment — “I Want to Hold Your Hand” — was leaked, played relentlessly on local radio and spread virally (before that was a thing) across the United States.The song surged to No. 1 on the Billboard charts on Jan. 18. Shortly after, John, Paul, George and Ringo braved thousands of screaming and crying fans at New York's Kennedy Airport on Feb. 7.But it’s their appearance on Sullivan’s show that’s recognized as a musical milestone, an event so entrenched in U.S. cultural history because of the sheer number of Americans who tuned in — 73 million viewers, translating to a 45 percent rating and 60 percent share of televisions.Numbers tell a story. Individual recollections tell it differently. Yahoo News asked readers to share not just what they remember about that collective experience, but also how the Beatles altered their lives, families and communities. Here are some lightly edited excerpts from what they wrote this week. ‘I started bopping around in my seat like a maniac’ In February 1964, Anthony Ventre attended high school in East Stroudsburg, Pa., where a “mixed rat pack of greasers and preppies” vied for rungs on the social ladder. He was a greaser, he says, sporting a leather jacket, a ducktail and the original Brylcreem in his hair. Ventre remembers Elvis Presley’s splash on the musical scene presaging the Beatles’ arrival and sparking that first cultural change. He writes: Everything seemed locked in, tidy, foreordained. It seems strange now, when I look back, to think that music changed all that. Two of the more significant musical events of that era were Elvis Presley and the arrival in the United States of the Beatles.Presley had already made a big impression on the nuns at the Catholic school I attended. One of my pals, George Pabst, had made a gyrating, crotch-bumping spectacle of himself in the center of the school cafeteria and got his knuckles rapped by Sister Donald. The rest of us sniggered and were delighted, of course.Then came the Beatles!I was sitting outside Jack's Market in East Stroudsburg in a lime-green 1953 Ford waiting for my father to return with groceries when "I Want to Hold Your Hand" came on the radio.I started bopping around in my seat like a maniac. My father returned, saw me, and questioned my sanity. Later on, when he saw and heard the music and pure excitement of the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show, I could tell that even he was amused.Suddenly, the ‘50s were laid to rest. Gone were the leather jackets, the ducktails and spit curls, replaced by mop tops, and a new type of hipness. Preppies were suddenly pushed to the back of the social bus as a new type of culture came on board.Dear diary: The Beatles were on TV tonightJacqueline Horsfall in 1964Fifteen-year-old Jacqueline Horsfall recalls Feb. 9 distinctly. Her dad called from the sofa: "The Beatles are on TV. Don't you want to watch?" She replied: "The what? Beetles?" She joined her parents to watch Ed Sullivan and while her mother was awestruck with the Beatles’ performance, Horsfall says she was not impressed. She writes:That night I wrote in my diary:Sunday, February 9 The Beatles were on the Ed Sullivan Show tonight. They're really different. Their haircuts are out of this world. I don't think they'll last long though. Boy, was I wrong! The next day at Minerva DeLand High School in Fairport, N.Y.:Monday, February 10 All the kids and teachers were talking about the Beatles. Ten of their songs are in the Top Twenty.Almost immediately we started imitating them:Tuesday, February 11 After church meeting tonight, everyone was acting like the Beatles. The boys wore their hair in a fringe, and we played two Beatle albums.An enterprising classmate sold Beatles photos at school, snapped off the Ed Sullivan Show:Tuesday, February 18 We talked about the Beatles in English. I bought two photos from E., one of Paul, one of John.The Beatles invaded America at the perfect moment. We were still in shock from JFK's assassination a few months before. Then Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK's accused assassin, as America watched. The Beatles, with their sweet love songs and silly banter, gave us a reprieve from the violence:Tuesday, February 25 Today was George Harrison's birthday. We sang "Happy Birthday" to him at lunch. The Beatles prompted tolerance of change, differences Fred Thomas III with his sister and mother in 1964Living in south Los Angeles, 12-year-old Fred Thomas III was told the Beatles’ debut on Ed Sullivan’s show was “special,” but he didn’t fully appreciate how culturally transformational their appearance would be. He writes:Month after month, year after year, you could feel change in the air. Music became the soundtrack of the cultural change we heard, and shows like Ed Sullivan allowed us to see what we were hearing.It seemed like only yesterday when the Beatles were introduced. The Ed Sullivan Show was very popular in our household because in addition to mainstream groups, we knew the show was fair in also presenting African-American entertainers.As an African-American family, we had been raised to respect and embrace all people. Events were happening very fast and it was amazing how music seemed to help people tolerate each other. The Beatles were synonymous in showcasing the benefit of embracing new cultures.At the time, the Motown sound was the dominant music heard in my community. There was pride in how the sound helped to influence our country's attitude. However, in 1964 when the Beatles hit the scene, they, too, fit right in.‘Only the very grumpiest of parents objected’ Sunday nights were special in Laurie Jo Miller Farr’s family in the ‘60s because of Ed Sullivan’s show. Her parents Farr, then 10, and her 15-year-old brother and 8-year-old twin sisters stay up late and eat Swanson’s TV dinners in front of their black-and-white RCA set. She writes: Despite the shockingly long, floppy hair and sideburns, the Beatles were well-groomed. They wore matching suits with skinny trousers and skinny ties as they harmonized on electric guitars over shared mikes. We were glued to the set. We memorized their names superimposed on the screen along with the words, "Sorry girls he's married," under John's name.I was thoroughly jealous of the teenage girls in the live audience. After all, one of those lucky girls could catch the eye of an unmarried Beatle. Ed Sullivan had booked the foursome for three Sundays in a row. He praised the “conduct” of these “fine youngsters from Liverpool, England." And why not? He'd achieved the largest TV audience ever assembled.At home the generation gap melted. This group was something new; they didn't even have choreographed moves. And all the way from England!My siblings and I pooled our piggy bank reserves for 47 cents to buy a 45 rpm record of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" with "I Saw Her Standing There" on the flipside. We were allowed to use the turntable of my parents' stereo HiFi because they instantly liked the Beatles, too. Beatlemania took America by storm and only the very grumpiest of parents objected. The Beatles unfortunately helped usher in unsavory elements Kathryn E. Darden with her parents in 1965Kathryn E. Darden, then 9 and living in Falls Church, Va., remembers how her quiet middle-class neighborhood in 1964 mirrored ‘50s and early ‘60s sitcoms: Moms wore dresses and reared children. Dads worked. Families ate together and went to church. Divorce and crime were rare. School shootings were nonexistent. She writes:The Beatles brought something new to our shores that changed American music. At first it was just a catchy pop sound that influenced an entire industry, including future Christian performers like Wynonna and Phil Keaggy.As their music took on more New Age and psychedelic overtones, the changing message of the Beatles helped usher in drastic and ultimately devastating changes to American culture. Beatles music became synonymous with drugs, sex, rock ‘n’ roll, rebellion and the breakdown of traditional values.While I loved Beatles' music as a child and teen, I stopped listening after their music and message changed. Some high school and college friends who continued to be heavily influenced by the Beatles and the counter-cultural movement slipped into drug abuse and other problems. Some left home to live on the streets. And the quiet community I grew up in is a high-crime area today.In hindsight, I wish the Beatles had kept their counter-culture message on their side of the pond.Food, music, accents — anything British became cool Tom Sanders, 10 in 1964, was in sixth grade in Mt. Morris, Mich., when the Beatles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand” supplanted Bobby Vinton’s cover of “There! I’ve Said It Again” — which his mother liked — as Billboard’s No. 1 song just days before their Ed Sullivan performance. Sanders calls Feb. 9, 1964, a watershed moment between his mother’s musical era and his. He writes: We had noon dances in the gym of the old brown brick junior high on Walter Street. Older kids played their 45s. A seventh grader brought in a "Meet The Beatles" album. (He became king of the whole school.) It was the first album I'd seen that wasn't a children's record or movie soundtrack. Every song was great. We had something new to ask for, if we could wait until our birthdays. Albums would eventually replace singles as our format of choice for recorded music.Anything British became cool. Kids acquired Scouse accents, or a taste for fish and chips. I had a short wave radio and could hear the BBC World Service, and I gained status of a sort. Sixth-grade girls still ran the other way.Radio also gave status to school bus window seats. Girls with radios grabbed them, seeking a few minutes of Beatles nourishment. Kids with only a casual interest in radio now waited through commercials for the Wee-tac (WTAC in Flint) Good Guys and Trix (WTRX) Jones Boys to spin another Fab Four hit. That December, transistor radios joined LPs as new items on Christmas wish lists.Mom got her music back when "Hello, Dolly" broke the string of Beatles No. 1s. More and more hit songs, however, would be written for teenagers. Without a band to grow with, I may have lost interest in radio, and music. Now, with each Beatles song I hear, I'm glad I didn't. Magical night suspended political, ideological acrimony Gail Cohen, then 21, hosted a Beatles-watching party on Feb. 9 in Miami, Fla., a city already inundated with anti-war protests, demonstrations and hippies. But, she says, the Beatles’ appearance on Sullivan’s show seemed to freeze all political and ideological disagreements — at least for one night. She writes: I cooked huge amounts of food and spent too much time choosing a hostess outfit consisting of a shirt, mini-skirt and go-go boots. Friends arrived giggling and excited. Like Stepford Wives, the girls' matching sky-high bouffant hairdos complemented cuts worn by guys who unashamedly emulated John, Paul, George and Ringo. Only a few guys wore close-cropped hair — those who had just returned from Vietnam. The night was magical.Since then, enthusiasm for the group hasn't diminished one iota. Paul's staying power, John's murder at his NYC apartment, George's painful death and Ringo's tenacity remained with the music behind our lives as we had children and grandchildren. With each successive generation, appreciation for the Beatles and their remarkable music and lyrics never diminished.Even today, I recall myself — giddy with anticipation — as I heard Ed Sullivan's theme music being played, knowing we were but minutes away from Ringo's first cymbal tap. We watched every move they made. We sang along since we knew all of the lyrics.How could we have known that we witnessed history that night?Arts & EntertainmentMediathe BeatlesEd Sullivan

Ocean Worm Wriggles Back Into View after 140 Years

A species of acorn worm, dubbed Glandiceps abyssicola, that has been rediscovered after not being seen …
In 1873, an unknown species of deep-sea worm was dredged up from the bottom of the ocean. Further analysis showed that the animal, collected from almost 3.5 miles (5.5 kilometers) beneath the surface, turned out to be a new type of acorn worm. It was dubbed Glandiceps abyssicola.	For nearly 140 years, that was the last that humans would see of this type of acorn worm. Acorn worms are a group of animals that live on the seafloor eating pieces of sediment and detritus that float down from above. And the single specimen that was collected in 1873 by the HMS Challenger found its way to Germany, where it was destroyed by bombs in World War II. [Deep-Sea Creepy Crawlies: Images of Acorn Worms]	Then, in 2009, a small chunk of yellow flesh turned up in a sample of sediment collected near the same spot as the original, in the equatorial Atlantic near South America. An anatomical and genetic study of the material, published last month in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, found that it was part of a Glandiceps abyssicola worm's body.	The main reason that the animal hadn't been spotted since 1873 is that it is very fragile, and tends to fall apart when dredged, said Karen Osborn, a study co-author and worm specialist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The dredging sled runs along the seafloor and knocks items into a net with a chain, which isn't exactly a gentle collecting technique, Osborn told LiveScience. Ideally, the animals are collected with submersibles, where they can be delicately plucked from the ocean bottom, she added.	The deep-sea acorn worms are quite different from their shallow-water relatives, which are more muscular, sturdier and easier to sample, Osborn said. The shallow-water variety also tend to dig burrows and siphon particles from the seafloor. This rediscovered species, however, crawls along the ocean bottom, eating particles of detritus.	"They are like little factories for digesting organic matter," Osborn said.	Acorn worms get their name from their proboscis, which resembles the cap of an acorn, Osborn said. Recent studies of which Osborn has been a part have identified more than a dozen new species of acorn worms. The present study was led by Nicholas Holland, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.	Email Douglas Main or follow him on Twitter or Google+.

Senators blast military response to sex assaults

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. senators dressed down senior military leaders Tuesday, led by female lawmakers, combat veterans and former prosecutors who insisted that sexual assault in the ranks has cost the services the trust and respect of the American people as well as the nation's men and women in uniform.Summoned to Capitol Hill, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the beribboned four-star chiefs of the service branches conceded in an extraordinary hearing that they had faltered in dealing with sexual assault. One said assaults were "like a cancer" in the military.But they strongly opposed congressional efforts to strip commanders of their traditional authority to decide whether to level charges in their units.Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, especially the panel's seven female senators, grilled the chiefs about whether the military's mostly male leadership understands differences between relatively minor sexual offenses and serious crimes that deserve swift and decisive justice."Not every single commander necessarily wants women in the force. Not every single commander believes what a sexual assault is. Not every single commander can distinguish between a slap on the ass and a rape because they merge all of these crimes together," said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.Frustration among the senators seemed to boil over as they discussed recent high-profile cases and statistics on sexual assault that underscored the challenges the Defense Department and Congress face.

Senate Armed Services Committee member Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., top right, questions militar …
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Navy veteran of Vietnam, said a woman came to him the previous night and said her daughter wanted to join the military. She asked McCain if he could give his unqualified support to her."I could not," McCain said. "I cannot overstate my disgust and disappointment over the continued reports of sexual misconduct in our military. We've been talking about the issue for years, and talk is insufficient."The committee is considering seven legislative proposals, including one introduced by Gillibrand that would deny commanders the authority to decide when criminal charges are filed and remove the ability of senior officers to convene courts-martial.More than 40 senators are sponsors or co-sponsors of the proposals, several of which have overlapping provisions. A bill by Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., would provide any victims with a special military lawyer who would assist them throughout the process. Another, sponsored by Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, would require any service member found guilty of rape or sexual assault receive a minimum punishment of a dismissal or a dishonorable discharge. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., introduced a bill with provisions that require commanders to submit reports of sex-related offenses to more senior officers within 24 hours.Dempsey and the service chiefs warned against making the dramatic changes called for in Gillibrand's legislation. Removing commanders from the military justice process, Dempsey said, would undercut their ability to preserve good order and discipline in their units.

"We cannot simply legislate our way out of this problem," said Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army's chief of staff. "Without equivocation, I believe maintaining the central role of commander in our military justice system is absolutely critical to any solution."But Gillibrand defended her proposal, which has garnered 18 co-sponsors in two weeks. She said victims of sexual assault are reluctant to report the crimes to their commanders because they fear their allegations will be dismissed and they might face retaliation. Aggressive reforms in the military's legal code are needed to force cultural changes, she said."You have lost the trust of the men and women who rely on you," Gillibrand said. "They're afraid to report. They think their careers will be over. They fear retaliation. They fear being blamed. That is our biggest challenge right there."Dempsey and the service chiefs told the committee they back Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's April recommendation to change the Uniform Code of Military Justice and largely strip commanding officers of the power to toss out a military verdict. That change is included in several of the Senate proposals including Gillibrand's and is likely to be adopted by the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday in its version of the annual defense policy bill.But Gillibrand and several other senators said that wasn't nearly enough.

Several members of the committee noted that American allies including Great Britain, Israel and Australia have already have taken serious cases outside the chain of command. The U.S. military leaders said they had just begun to study the changes to see how they might apply to this country.The committee's Democratic chairman, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, opened the hearing by saying the problem of sexual assault "is of such a scope and magnitude that it has become a stain on our military." Levin has not endorsed any of the bills.The military leaders didn't dispute Levin's assessment."Sexual assault and harassment are like a cancer within the force, a cancer that left untreated will destroy the fabric of our force," Odierno said. "It's imperative that we take a comprehensive approach to prevent attacks, to protect our people, and where appropriate, to prosecute wrongdoing and hold people accountable."While acknowledging the problem and accepting that legislation is inevitable, the military leaders insisted that commanders keep their authority to handle serious offenses including sexual assault cases that occur in their units.

The Air Force's top officer, Gen. Mark Welsh, said, "Commanders having the authority to hold airmen criminally accountable for misconduct ... is crucial to building combat-ready, disciplined units."But, their voices rising, female members of the committee complained that the military's reporting process fails to recognize the seriousness of rape."This isn't about sex," said McCaskill, a former county prosecutor in Missouri. "This is about assaultive domination and violence. And as long as those two get mushed together, you all are not going to be as successful as you need to be at getting after the most insidious part of this, which is the predators in your ranks that are sullying the great name of our American military."The Pentagon estimated in a recent report that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2011, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel. While the number of sexual assaults that members of the military actually reported rose 6 percent to 3,374 in 2012, thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, the report said.Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., suggested that youth is partly to blame for the problem. "The young folks that are coming into each of your services are anywhere from 17 to 22 or 23," he said. "The hormone level created by nature sets in place the possibility for these types of things to occur." But Chambliss also said the military and Congress need to do far more to stop sexual assaults from occurring.

Commanders and senior enlisted troops are ultimately responsible for ensuring that their units don't develop climates conducive to sexual assaults and harassment. But Dempsey said that he and other military leaders haven't kept their fingers on the pulse of their units as closely as they should over the past decade due to the heavy pace of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan."I think I took my eye off the ball a bit in the commands that I had," said Dempsey, who spent more than three years as a commander in Iraq.Dempsey also said in response to a question from McCain that there are gaps in the way the services screen prospective recruits that could allow an individual with a history of sex-related crimes to join."There are currently, in my judgment, inadequate protections for precluding that from happening," Dempsey told McCain. "So a sex offender could, in fact, find their way into the armed forces of the United States."The committee's hearing, which lasted nearly eight hours with testimony from three different panels of witnesses, came as a string of incidents has raised doubts about how aggressively the services are acting to change their cultures and eradicate sexual assaults.Last week, the Pentagon said the U.S. Naval Academy is investigating allegations that three football team members sexually assaulted a female midshipman at an off-campus house more than a year ago. A lawyer for the woman says she was "ostracized" on campus after she reported it.In recent weeks, a soldier at the U.S. Military Academy was charged with secretly photographing women, including in a bathroom. The Air Force officer who led the service's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit was arrested on charges of groping a woman. And the manager of the Army's sexual assault response program at Fort Campbell, Ky., was relieved of his post after his arrest in a domestic dispute with his ex-wife.Military & DefenseArmed ForcesKirsten GillibrandMartin Dempseysexual assault

Witnesses: Church torched in eastern Libya

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — Witnesses say that unidentified assailants torched a church used by Egyptian Christians in Libya's eastern city of Benghazi on Thursday, a week after scores of Christians were detained and reportedly abused by militias there for alleged proselytization.Flames were seen rising from the church, witnesses said. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning what it described as "assault," and that the church's priest was not inside and is unhurt.Abdel-Salam al-Barghathi, a security official in Benghazi, said his forces stopped angry men from doing more damage to the church. He says they were angry about a protest by Christians in front of the Libyan embassy in Cairo, where they set fire to the Libyan flag.The protests came after death of one Egyptian Christian detainee in Libya, whose family says he died of torture. They say Ezzat Atallah, who died in detention in Tripoli after being transferred from his prison in Benghazi, was one of around 100 Christians, mostly Egyptians, who were detained by militias on suspicion of trying to covert Muslims to Christianity.Al-Barghathi appeared to blame the Christian protesters for the violence. He said Atallah died of natural causes and that he confessed before his death. "I got everything taped. He confessed and we videotaped his confessions. Why do the Christians burn the flag and replace it with a cross?" he said."These incidents will take place once and twice if the reactions on the other side continue like this," he warned.Libya has seen multiple outbreaks of disorder since the 2011 civil war that led to the killing and ouster of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The security and political vacuum has allowed hardline Islamist militias to act with impunity, especially since the government has relied on ex-rebel groups to keep order in absence of a functioning police force or a unified military.On Sept. 11, four Americans including the U.S. Ambassador in Libya Chris Stevens were killed in an assault on the U.S. mission in Benghazi. An Islamist extremist militia that had been handling some security duties in the city, Ansar al-Shariah, was blamed for the attack. Months later, several Western countries withdrew their nationals from Benghazi citing imminent threats.Churches, shrines used by traditionalist Muslims, and a Commonwealth war cemetery have also been vandalized in Benghazi and other cities in attacks blamed on hard-line Islamist puritans.Last week, Egypt's Foreign Ministry intervened to win the release of 55 Egyptians who were in the group suspected of proselytizing. Thirty-five of them were deported for illegally entering the country, while 20 were cleared to stay in Libya.Four foreigners under investigation for alleged espionage and proselytizing remain in a Libyan prison. They are a Swedish-American, a South Korean, a South African and an Egyptian.Politics & GovernmentReligion & BeliefsEgyptian Foreign MinistryBenghaziEgyptian Christians
