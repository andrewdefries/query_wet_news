Apple refreshed its lineup of Mac computers on Tuesday. It unveiled a 13-inch MacBook Pro with a sharper screen and introduced an iMac storage drive that combines the speed of flash memory and the capacity of traditional hard drives. Here are prices and other details on the new products.MODELS AND PRICES:Apple Inc. introduced a new MacBook Pro with a 13-inch screen measured diagonally. It sports a sharper, Retina display, which has a resolution of 2560 by 1600 pixels. That is slightly lower than the 2880 by 1800 pixels of its 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, but is far better the 1280 by 800 resolution of the existing, 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Retina display.Prices vary depending on how much flash memory the computer comes with and the speed of the Intel processor. The base model comes with a 2.5 gigahertz dual-core Intel i5 processor.— 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, i5 processor with 128 gigabytes of flash storage, $1,699— 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, i5 processor with 256 GB flash storage, $1,999These were the models unveiled in June and still available:— 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, 2.3 GHz quad-core i7 processor with 256 GB flash storage, $2,199— 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, 2.6 GHz quad-core i7 processor with 512 GB flash storage, $2,799— Non-Retina 13-inch MacBook Pro, 2.5 GHz dual-core i5 processor with 500 GB hard drive, $1,199— Non-Retina 13-inch MacBook Pro, 2.9 GHz dual-core i7 processor with 750 GB hard drive, $1,499— Non-Retina 15-inch MacBook Pro, 2.3 GHz quad-core i7 processor with 500 GB hard drive, $1,799— Non-Retina 15-inch MacBook Pro, 2.6 GHz quad-core i7 processor with 750 GB hard drive, $2,199Apple also introduced a new line of iMacs. The computers have a super-thin edge that is 5 millimeters (0.2 inch) thick, although the unit is more bulbous at the point where it connects with the stand. The new model achieves its severe thinness in part by eliminating the optical disc drive. Apple has been leaving those drives out of its most recent laptop models as well.Prices vary by screen size, the amount of storage and the processor speed. The base model comes with a 1 terabyte hard drive and a 2.7 gigahertz quad-core Intel i5 processor. Apple also introduced its Fusion Drive, which combines flash and hard drive storage in one interface. Apple says it's nearly as fast as flash memory on its own and is available as an option instead of the regular hard drive.— 21.5-inch iMac, 2.7 GHz quad-core i5 processor, 1 terabyte hard drive, $1,299— 21.5-inch iMac, 2.9 GHz quad-core i5 processor, 1 TB hard drive, $1,499— 27-inch iMac, 2.9 GHz quad-core i5 processor, 1 TB hard drive, $1,799— 27-inch iMac, 3.2 GHz quad-core i5 processor, 1 TB hard drive, $1,999Apple updated its Mac Mini computer as well with the following specifications:— 2.5 GHz dual-core i5 processor, 500GB hard drive, $599— 2.3 GHz quad-core i7 processor, 1 TB hard drive, $799— 2.3 GHz quad-core i7 processor, two 1 TB hard drives, $999AVAILABILITY:The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display is available immediately online, at Apple stores and other retailers. The 21.5-inch iMac will be available in November and the 27-inch iMac will be available in December. The Mac mini is available immediately.ComputingTechnology & ElectronicsMacBook Pro
