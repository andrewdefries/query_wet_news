N.J. Woman Gives Birth on Front Lawn

View photo.N.J. Woman Gives Birth on Front Lawn Two New Jersey police officers helped revive a newborn moments after he was born on a front lawn in Barnegat to a woman who said she didn't realize she was pregnant.
According to the Barnegat Police Department, two officers arrived just after 21-year-old Elizabeth Whitehead gave birth to her son in the yard. The officers found the baby boy unresponsive and without a pulse and immediately began CPR before the ambulance had arrived. In the ambulance the medical staff were able to stabilize the baby's heart rhythm and normalize his breathing.
The infant was stabilized and then admitted to the Jersey Shore Medical Center for further treatment Tuesday. Whitehead was treated and released from the Southern Ocean Medical Center.
According to the Lacey Patch, Whitehead also has a 9-month-old son and had no clue she was pregnant. Instead she thought early labor pains were menstrual cramps. When the pain became worse she headed to the hospital, but only made it to her front lawn.
According to Dr. Lori Gawron, obstetrician and gynecologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, some women mistakenly believe they cannot become pregnant within weeks of giving birth.
"Moms don't think how quickly after they deliver they can resume ovulation," said Gawron, who did not treat Whitehead. "They can start ovulation 25 days after having a baby."
Another complication for new moms is breastfeeding. Although breastfeeding can severely decrease the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, some women can spontaneously ovulate, especially if they are not exclusively breastfeeding.
Dr. Karen Ashby, associate professor of reproductive medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, said she has had patients arrive at her office pregnant only six weeks after giving birth.
"If they're not getting their period they think they can't get pregnant, which isn't true," said Ashby, who did not treat Whitehead.

The iPhone as paintbrush
Check out these mesmerizing artworks created on the iPhone (before they hit the galleries)

by Rob Walker I’ve been a devoted fan of PhoneArts.net, which collects art made with iPhones, for a while now, and all along I thought this was an eccentric interest of mine. It turns out, however, that this Tumblr has about 200,000 followers; and moreover, as I discovered when I reached out to my favorite contributor to the site, and then to one of its co-founders, the enthusiasm for the iPhone-made visual works showcased there seems poised to cross over: from the comparatively tiny screens of smartphones into the realm of gallery shows and physical works.
This was not exactly on the agenda when interaction designer and Phone Arts co-founder Daniel Littlewood started messing around with various visual-creation iPhone apps a couple of years ago. He was simply interested in exploiting his phone to creative ends — instead of merely using it to check status updates or play games. “It’s a tool that can be used in many different ways,” Littlewood told me, and he wanted to explore what he could make with his iPhone, as opposed to what he could take in through it. He posted some results to Flickr and as a result heard from the creator of one of the apps he’d been playing with: Doodle Buddy inventor Guillaume Hugon. They decided to launch Phone Arts, in November 2011, essentially to ask the question: “What can we do with our phones? How far can we take it?” Hugon is in France, Littlewood in New York. Both reached out to fellow artists and designers, and rounded up about a dozen regular contributors to their Tumblr. Among the New York contacts Littlewood approached as a “guest” contributor is the guy whose contributions to the site largely hooked me on Phone Arts: Thomas Pregiato. "Vase" and "Shear," two phone arts by Tom Pregiato.
“I was kind of turned off by it at first,” Pregiato admits. But the more he played with apps like Art Studio, manipulating images of, say, a snapshot he’d taken of an interesting pattern on someone’s jacket, the more he got into it. The results are visually beguiling: this textured abstraction started out as a cropped snap of an ad on the subway; this vivid composition was once a picture of a goldfish tank; and this jagged visual began as a picture found online of Picasso’s “Guernica.” While other touchscreen-made art, by David Hockney among others, has been celebrated before, much of it has struck me as looking pretty much like traditional painting. That’s fine, but the pieces on Phone Arts, by Pregiato and others, often have a different quality — some tighter (and less gimmicky) connection between medium and message. “I’d prefer not to give away my techniques,” Pregiato told me, but because his process largely involves using his fingers on the touch screen, it’s a form of art-making that actually feels “very analog.” I’m not the only one who’s impressed: Fans have inquired about acquiring physical versions of Pregiato’s pieces, which creates an interesting challenge. If printed at a size much larger than a business card, the images don’t really hold together. But he’s working on a surprising solution for de-digitizing online work into objects: 18-by-24-inch needlepoint versions of works like this one, now in progress. Littlewood says the audience for Phone Arts started to spike about six months after it was launched and has continued to grow. Contributors to the site have gotten more ambitious, often tweaking images in four, five, or six different apps — Littlewood mentions SlitScan, SculptMatster, AutoDesk 123D, Brushes and others — before arriving at a final piece. Along the way, many traditional art galleries have shown an increasing interest in tapping into the digital-art scene — not least, one assumes, because some online creators have racked up impressive Web followings. It did not surprise me to hear that someone from Tumblr itself, which is fairly proactive about cultivating and promoting anything remotely creative that plays out over the platform, got in touch with a curator that Littlewood works with. Strictly speaking, though, I’d argue that it won’t take a gallery show to make a point about how to use free time and digital tools creatively: PhoneArts.net has already done that. * You can follow Rob Walker on Twitter.

Pope’s Dope Advice: Church Needs To Stop Fixating on Gays, Abortion

Pope Francis is sounding off on the Catholic Church's apparent fixation on gays and abortions, saying the church needs to be more welcoming and stop getting locked up in "small-minded rules."In an in-depth interview with Jesuit journals, including America Magazine, the 76-year-old Argentinian leader of the Vatican Church says there is too much dogma and is surprising some with his semi-tolerant tone on gays and women who have had abortion.	"We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. This is not possible," he said. ‘Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?’ We must always consider the person. To be clear: The Pope isn't changing church doctrine, but he is calling for a less judgmental church. The rules, Francis says, are clear and he agrees with them, "but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time. The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent."	Calling himself a sinner who believes in the holy sacrament of confession, Francis says it's the church's work to help everyone move forward in their Christian lives. "The confessional is not a torture chamber, but the place in which the Lord's mercy motivates us to do better," said Francis. Francis describes the situation of a woman who has had a failed marriage and an abortion who "remarries, and she is now happy and has five children. That abortion in her past weighs heavily on her conscience and she sincerely regrets it. She would like to move forward in her Christian life." Francis said the woman should see the church as a partner in her salvation, not as someone who would judge her. Maybe it would be even more tolerant to accept that woman even if she doesn't get married and have a bunch of babies later in life...but we'll take it and call it "baby steps."

NEW YORK (AP) — Who would Mitt Romney like to see play him in a movie? (Gene Hackman)What's Romney's guilty pleasure (peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate milk).And what exactly, does the Republican presidential hopeful wear to bed?"Really? Really?" Romney said during an interview taped Friday on ABC's "Live! With Kelly and Michael." ''I think the best answer is as little as possible."Romney held hands with his wife, Ann, during a lighthearted interview that delved into topics rarely found on the Sunday talkshow circuit and gave the Republican nominee a chance to show his knowledge of pop culture. Like whether he knew much about MTV's "Jersey Shore" star Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi."I'm kind of a Snooki fan," Romney confessed. "Look how tiny's she's gotten. She's lost weight. She's energetic. Just her spark-plug personality is kind of fun."

Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney puts on his jacket before b …
The Romneys sat down with hosts Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan in an interview scheduled to air Tuesday that covered more typical topics — Romney's plans for reducing unemployment and jumpstarting the economy along with his positions on gun control and health care.Asked to name something the nation doesn't know about the presidential candidate, Ann Romney said, "He's got a good heart, and I don't think people know that about him."But the chat took a fun-loving turn when Ripa and Strahan decided the Romneys should participate in a special "Romney Rapid Fire Round." ''If you think a political debate is tough, just buckle up," Ripa warned.The questions got pretty personal. Asked about a "guilty pleasure," Romney admitted to peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate milk, while Ann Romney confessed to enjoying donuts.
