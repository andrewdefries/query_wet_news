Bands such as the Arctic Monkeys have helped vinyl sales to reach their highest level since 2001

Sales of vinyl albums in Britain have doubled year on year in the first nine months of 2013, marking a significant milestone in the format’s comeback.
The BPI, the record industry’s trade body, estimates that sales will pass 700,000 by the end of the year, reaching their highest level since 2001. More than 500,000 had been sold by the end of last month, according to their survey, with 15,000 bought each week.
Rock is overwhelmingly popular, with the Arctic Monkeys’ AM the second bestselling vinyl album of the year, and five other rock LPs in the Top Ten. Daft Punk’s

It seems to be mandatory these days that every domestic news story must include the comment “This could lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England”. I have yet to spot it in any piece of journalism relating to Tom Daley’s new diving show on ITV, but perhaps in the interest of consistency, Archbishop-elect Welby could volunteer to step up to the diving board in place of Tina Malone and the tally will be complete.
There it was, blaring out of the Daily Mail that the Prince of Wales was worried by the Government’s moves to change the Act

Hollande has derailed the Franco-German locomotive and taxed the electorate’s patience
At the Elysée Palace, François Hollande is known for his witty repartee and his nonconfrontational style. To questions asked by his ministers the President is said to answer “oui” or “oui oui”. As Le Canard Enchaîné, the Gallic Private Eye, revealed: the presidential “oui oui” actually means “non”.
In May last year, the French chose Mr Hollande as their next president, the first Socialist to lead the country in a generation, for precisely this reason: his talent for inclusiveness and compromise, his genial manners and gentle charisma. For his competence too. Mr Hollande had managed to hold the fractious, explosive

Wilshere out for six weeks as injury jinx strikes again
Oliver Kay, Gary Jacob
Last updated at 5:57PM, March 6 2014
Jack Wilshere fears that he could miss the World Cup finals after breaking his left foot in the friendly against Denmark, with Roy Hodgson vowing to take only fully fit players to Brazil.
The Arsenal midfielder has been ruled out for six weeks after being the victim of a robust tackle by Daniel Agger on Wednesday. He will have no more than four Barclays Premier League matches to prove his fitness before Hodgson names his provisional 30-man England squad on May 13.
A scan conducted by Arsenal yesterday showed that Wilshere suffered a hairline fracture to the navicular bone in his left foot, which was at odds with an examination carried out about 12 hours earlier by England that showed only bruising.
Wilshere played on for 38 minutes having looked as though he would be taken off on a stretcher after the challenge by Agger in the twelfth minute. The Liverpool defender has apologised but said that it was a fair tackle.
Before he learnt of Wilshere’s injury, Hodgson had said that it would not be right to pick players who represent a risk, based on the evidence of past tournaments. David Beckham did not regain full fitness after a metatarsal injury before the 2002 World Cup finals, Wayne Rooney suffered a similar injury but recovered to play in the tournament four years later and Gareth Barry had an ankle injury in 2010.

Blossoming Brown puts Halfpenny in shade
Leigh Halfpenny finished last year with a list of awards almost as long as one of his booming penalty goals: RBS Six Nations Championship Player of the Tournament, Lions Player of the Series, Welsh Sports Personality of the Year, IRB Player of the Year nominee and runner-up to Andy Murray in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year to boot. A lucrative contract to join Toulon was in the process of being agreed and his crown as the northern hemisphere’s premier full back was safe. Until now. Without the slightest drop in his own remarkably high standards, Wales’s icon has found his place in the hypothetical team of the tournament usurped by a player, Mike Brown, who was not even playing at full back in last year’s Six Nations. There is time for Halfpenny to reassert his authority, not least with a commanding performance at Twickenham on Sunday, but in the statistics he has been left trai

Robshaw proud of team in adversity
Root faces break as Bell stands by The thumb injury suffered by Joe Root while making his first one-day international century will rule him out of the three Twenty20 matches against West Indies and possibly the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.
Root flew home from Barbados yesterday after X-rays revealed a fracture in his right thumb. He will see a specialist early next week before a decision is
taken about his involvement in the World Twenty20, but Ian Bell is now likely to travel to Bangladesh as cover and will be promoted to the 15-man squad if Root is ruled out.
Bell was not included in England’s original 30-man squad for the global tournament, but had been summoned to Barbados as cover for Alex Hales, who is recovering from a thigh strain.
