Forex trader suspended as scandal widens
James Dean, Philip Aldrick and Juliet Samuel
Last updated at 10:22PM, March 6 2014
A senior currency trader who served on the Bank of England’s foreign exchange committee has been suspended by his bank, dealing a further blow to London’s position as the world’s leading centre for forex trading.
BNP Paribas, the French investment bank, has suspended Robert de Groot, its global head of foreign exchange spot trading, who joined the Bank of England’s chief dealers’ group in 2007, it emerged yesterday.
The chief dealers’ group — a committee of senior forex traders and Bank officials — was thrust into the spotlight this week after the Bank responded to allegations that it had turned a blind eye to warnings that currency markets were being manipulated. The Bank released a cache of minutes from meetings of the group, which revealed that potential manipulation of the forex markets had first been discussed nearly eight years ago — long before the Bank decided to investigate.
Mr de Groot is the fourth member of the chief dealers’ group to have been suspended by their employer since allegations of currency fixing surfaced last year. In all, 29 traders have served on the chief dealers’ group since it was created in 2005, according to minutes of the group’s meetings.
Joseph Landes, a senior currency trader at Bank of America, has also been suspended, it emerged yesterday. Mr Landes did not serve on the chief dealers’ group.
Politicians and former central bankers warned that the forex scandal had put the Bank’s credibility at stake. A second regulatory failure after Libo

Mystery Bitcoin creator ‘discovered’
His true identy has been shrouded in mystery for years, but now, possibly, he may have been uncovered.
Known as “the father of Bitcoin”, the digital currency worth billions, Satoshi Nakamoto appeared to vanish in 2010 when he stopped responding to all messages from Bitcoin’s early adherents.
Since then, wild theories have spread in the digital world about his existence. Some believed his name was the pseudonym for a whizkid hacker based in Tokyo. Others believed it was the name of a collective of computer programmers. Nobody has claimed to have met him in person.
But according to a report, he is a 64-year-old Japanese immigrant living in a small town in California. He has been described as a “amazing physicist” who worked on secret US government projects, and who spends his days tending to his passion for model train sets.
And his name really is Satoshi

Police investigate death of Bitcoin chief	Barclays to break link with PwC
Barclays is to part company with PwC, its auditor for the past 120 years. The bank is pre-empting British and European regulations designed to shake up the audit market. PwC’s auditing of Barclays has come under the spotlight, with the Financial Reporting Council in December dropping a two-year inquiry into its compliance reports.
PwC has been Barclays’ auditor since 1896, when Price Waterhouse first signed off on the bank’s accounts, and the last tender was ten years ago. While Barclays’ audit committee was satisfied with the PwC’s performance, the bank’s annual report discloses that it will start a tender next year or in 2016 and that PwC will not be invited to take part.
Barclays is anticipating a European Union regulation that will place a 20-year cap on auditors, while the Competition Commission is expected to implement its decision that companies should tender their auditing ever

Corporate dealmaking had its strongest July since before Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, new figures have revealed.
Global M&A deals last month totalled $237.3 billion, the highest level for July since the $352.7 billion recorded in July 2008, according to Thomson Reuters. Deal activity in the first six months of the year was lower than expected because of lingering fears over the eurozone crisis, the impact of the so-called spending cuts “sequester” on the American economy and uncertainty over whether central bank money-printing programmes would be extended.
However, last week the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England committed

The Chancellor must resist the siren voices of the Right. A boring Budget is the best bet
It is difficult not sympathise with the Chancellor who is under a lot of pressure from Conservative backbenchers. One normally level-headed MP has even demanded a “psychologically inspiring” Budget. Perhaps he needs to discover opera. More generally, the calls are for a “strategy for growth”. If only the Chancellor would act “boldly”, growth would follow and the deficit be reduced. And the Conservatives would win the election.
The Budget I am sure will have some measures labelled “supply side” to support growth. But the problem with supply-side measures is that they take time. Better education, more infrastructure, even less regulation

Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and gourmand famed for his diet of worms, used to speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men and German to his horse. Sergio Parisse, the Italy No 8, is just as talented, tweeting in four different languages last week, but he may need to find a fifth for chuntering at referees. It turns out that the abuse Parisse dealt Laurent Cardona during a Top 14 match on Saturday, which earned him a red card, was in English. It may lead to him missing Saturday’s match with Wales and possibly the rest

Apple won’t unlock dead woman’s iPad Apple has been criticised for refusing to unlock a dead woman’s iPad.
Josh Grant, 26, said his mother Anthea bequeathed the tablet to her family after buying the computer during her treatment for cancer.
After her death, they have been unable to unlock it despite supplying Apple with copies of her will, death certificate and a solicitor’s letter.
Apple has said that its security measures help its customers protect lost or stolen devices. Mrs Grant used it for games and video calls with her sons. In her will, she said her estate should be split between her five boys, with
GCHQ ‘watched millions on their webcams’
Yahoo! has angrily reacted to reports that British spies intercepted and stored webcam images from millions of its customers around the world, describing the practice as “a whole new level of violation of our users’ privacy”.
It is believed that GCHQ, with assistance from the US National Security agency, ran a surveillance programme that collected still images from webcam conversations held by Yahoo! users. It is understood that many sexually explicit pictures were also collected, though not intentionally.
The operation, called Optic Nerve, took place between 2008 and 2010, according to a
BlackBerry goes back to the future
The new chief executive of BlackBerry has returned the struggling company to its roots with the launch of a new smartphone in the style of its popular keyboard-centric models of yesteryear.
John Chen, chief executive of BlackBerry, dubbed the phone ‘the BlackBerry Classic’ although it will officially be called the Q20. The new handset will launch before the end of the year and will restore not only the famous keyboard but also the trackpad used to scroll through emails.
Mr Chen took over the company after a disastrous 2013 when it attempted to compete with Apple and Sams
First look: Samsung Galaxy S5
Samsung had something to prove with its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S5, which was unveiled this week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The Korean company has publicly stated its dissatisfaction with the sales performance of the S4, launched last year, despite the phone maintaining Samsung’s status as the world’s largest phone maker.
The new version of the Galaxy is certainly an improvement that had the retailers at the conference licking their lips in anticipation. A bigger brighter screen and a tag line claiming the phone to be the fastest on the market
