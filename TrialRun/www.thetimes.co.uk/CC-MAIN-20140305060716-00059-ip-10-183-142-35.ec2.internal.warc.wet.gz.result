Market report Published at 12:01AM, October 16 2012
The stock market’s steady start to the week could have looked far brighter had miners not lost their lustre.
They had Goldman Sachs partly to blame for that. The broker, one of the biggest names in commodities on Wall Street, became the latest to voice concern about demand for raw materials by China, the largest consumer of metal.
Eugene King, the head of Goldman’s metals and mining team in Europe, declared commodity markets to be adjusting to a new phase of slower growth of demand from China, after a prolonged period of fast growth.
As Goldman’s commodity gurus separately tinkered

Anger was mounting among small businesses on the Isle of Arran last night at uncertainty about power for one of their most profitable times of year.
Over the Easter weekend, hotels, cottages and campsites traditionally welcome thousands of visitors, but a week-long white-out has come close to crippling services on the island.
Yesterday, consumers in the Whiting Bay area lost power after an emergency generator failed, and by late afternoon Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) said 100 customers remained without electricity.
After conflicting advice about the power supply one hotelier said he could not risk opening.
“We are caught between

If music leaves you cold, blame the brain
Jimi Hendrix described it as his religion, while Shakespeare thought it might be the “food of love”. For many people, music is a universal language.
However, it appears that not everyone feels the same way about a soaring melody or a hypnotic rhythm. Scientists have found that certain people who get pleasure from other aspects of life, such as food, sex or humour, are left strangely cold by music.
Josep Marco-Pallarés, who led the study at the University of Barcelona, said: “They are somehow indifferent to music. They say five out of ten for everything and don’t feel any
GM cells to be tested as new HIV therapy HIV patients could be treated with genetically modified cells that are resistant to the virus, scientists say, following the first trial into the therapy.
The treatment, which has not been tested on humans before, raised patients’ defences against HIV by replacing some of their natural immune cells with disease-resistant versions.
Half of the patients in the the trial were taken off their usual drugs and several of these showed reduced levels of the virus in their system.
Scientists said that the small trial, on which 12 patients were enrolled, was designed to assess t
Toddlers have an eye for those to be trusted The observational skills of toddlers may seem fairly crude when they pose questions such as: “Mummy, why has that man got black teeth?”
Yet psychologists say that children as young as three are able to make sophisticated judgments about character traits, such as trustworthiness and competence, simply by looking at a person’s face.
Research suggests that the ability to draw conclusions based on physical appearance does not require years of social experience, but starts early in a child’s life.
Emily Cogsdill, a psychologist at Harvard University in the United States, who led the study, said: “
New prostate cancer test offers more accuracy
A test for prostate cancer that promises to detect the disease more accurately could soon be available in clinics.
Preliminary trials suggest that the urine test is more accurate than the current PSA blood test and could help doctors to tell how far the disease has spread. However, more extensive research will be needed before the test is widely available on the NHS. The test looks for the EN2 protein, which is produced by tumours in the prostate and bladder, and several studies have suggested it picks up more than two thirds of cancers. Under a deal announced yesterday, Randox Laboratories,
