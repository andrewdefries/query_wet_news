The Queen Elizabeth Hall wasn’t full, and it should have been. But Jean-Efflam Bavouzet is not a pianist who draws the celeb hunters, nor the piano-circuit groupies, still less the media-obedient. Instead, he has an ever-growing concentrated following of those who relish a sophisticated, canny musician who plays with an infectious sense of childlike delight.
And the sound of the Bavouzet fingers is distinctive. It is searching, penetrating, imaginatively fired, and endlessly curious in its exploration of any composer’s unique sound palette and language. For Haydn, for example, Bavouzet played the Sonata in C minor (Hob XVI/20) on a bright-toned

It looks as if it was Jack wot won it. Ministers have moved to announce a ban on referral fees - pre-empting Jack Straw’s own ten-minute rule bill and no doubt spurred into action by his highlighting of what he called a “racket” and the insurance industry’s “grubby little secret.”
The decision slots in well with ministers’ plans to curb lawyers’ no-win no-fee deals - which along with the ban was also recommended by Lord Justice Jackson in his civil costs review - and more widely to crack down on the so-called compensation culture.

My father arrived on these shores in 1966 as a Muslim, Pakistani, and harbouring deep suspicions about British cultural assumptions. Almost half a century later, he is a monarchist, Radio 4 aficionado and just about the most patriotic Brit I know. With the exception of his Christianity, to which he converted, Britishness is perhaps the most important and cherished affiliation of his life.
My maternal grandfather, who died last week at 98, lived a very different life to my father. Born in the Rhondda Valley at the outset of the Great War, he worked down the pits from 14 then

A British tourist died from choking on his vomit while in custody in Dubai, its attorney-general said yesterday, dismissing claims he was beaten to death by police.
Lee Brown, 39, was arrested last week after allegedly attacking a Nepalese housemaid and trying to throw her from the sixth-floor of the luxury Burj Al Arab hotel. His death on Tuesday was followed by reports that officers punched, kicked and struck him with batons while he was in custody at Bur Dubai police station.
Issam Al Humaidan, Dubai’s attorney-general, said that a post-mortem examination had found Mr Brown had choked on vomit,

From the smugglers of the Star Inn to the white horse on High and Over, history is carved into the chalk of the Downs
A brisk and cloudy morning over East Sussex, with the sun running its fingers capriciously along the spine of the South Downs where they made their final eastward roll before smoothing out into the coastal plains beyond Eastbourne. Here Alfriston sits in a gap carved by the snaking Cuckmere River in the chalk wall of the Downs, a natural gathering place for travellers going east-west along the ridge, or north-south between the fertile lowlands of the Sussex Weald and the pebbly coastline with its mighty white cliffs.
We gathered on the outskirts of Alfriston, a mixed bag of siblings, cousins
