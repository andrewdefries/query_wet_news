Torture is a theme experienced all too literal in this grim revival of the Michael Blakemore production
Torture in Tosca is supposed to happen offstage, with the unfortunate Cavaradossi groaning out loud as minions of Rome’s police chief Scarpia try to extract information in ways we can only imagine. But the curse of Welsh National Opera’s latest revival of Michael Blakemore’s 18-year-old production is that torture threatens the audience as well.Heavy and lumbering, anchored in architecturally grandiose “authentic” sets that need every minute of the two intervals to shift, Blakemore’s staging does not make the spirits soar. Yet its sins at least never penetrate the eardrums, unlike the sounds that tumbled from Tosca’s mouth on press

Nick Clegg set out the grounds for divorce from David Cameron yesterday, lifting the lid on the “tooth and nail” fights within the coalition.
The Liberal Democrat leader used his speech at the close of his party’s conference to start detaching himself from the Conservatives in the run-up to the next election.
He made an impassioned

Scotch lovers should raise a glass to the land of the rising sun who were taught how to make scotch nearly 100 years ago
Mexico has just announced the launch of its first whisky, Williamson 18. That it’s available by the can makes me think that Johnnie Walker needn’t worry just yet, but it’s a sign of how global the whisky market is becoming. At the last count there were 27 countries making cereal-based whisky, although you can guarantee that some tiny whisky distillery in Cambodia will have announced itself to the world just after I filed this column. Scotland, Ireland and America may still rule the roost, but there are now world-class whiskies coming out of India, Taiwan, Sweden and even Tasmania. If you were to go on awards alone Japan is the nation to watch — its meticulously made single malts and blends now feature regularly among the trophies at top competitions. Technically speaking, Japanese whisky is very similar to Scotch, because it was the Scots who taught the Japanese how to make it nearly 100 years ago. Even though Japan has fewer than a dozen distilleries (Scotland has more than 100), it manages to produce a huge range of styles, from sweet, aromatic and fruity to big and smoky. The Japanese love drinking whisky with lots of iced water or soda water and many of their whiskies are designed for this – a good example is Yamazaki 12, a malt with succulent pineapple and jasmine incense.
