Why Well, by “everyone” we mean President Obama, who recommended it to his friend Oprah Winfrey, who waxed long and lyrical about it on her show. The last film to merit such attention from Oprah was Precious, about an African-American teenager, and it ended up with two Oscars.

Travelodge has unveiled a new weapon in its battle to regain the ground lost to Premier Inn during its recent fight for survival — the “Rolls-Royce of beds”.
The chain, which completed a painful financial restructuring in October, said yesterday that it would be replacing more than 30,000 beds as part of a £57 million refurbishment of its 500-plus hotels.
Grant Hearn, chief executive, said that the chain currently had the same beds as Premier Inn, featuring an open-sprung mattress. However, the new king-size beds would have an 800-pocket sprung mattress that provided “a much more comfortable sleep”.

Siegfried and Roy, the Las Vegas illusionists, once made an elephant disappear. The Chinese authorities have gone one better. They have made half the country’s rivers vanish.
Some 28,000 rivers have disappeared from China’s maps compared with the more than 50,000 recorded in the 1990s. Blame the apparent loss on errors made by earlier cartographers, say Chinese officials fumbling for an explanation, and on climate change that has caused waterways to dry up. Environmentalists see things differently. They trace the disappearance of thousands of rivers to a helter-skelter rush for economic development that has ignored environmental concerns.

Money spent wisely before emergencies on disaster preparedness pays huge benefits in mitigating the effects of natural calamities
Sir, The argument put forward by Ross Clark (Opinion, Nov 12) that aid spending should be recalibrated away from long-term projects in favour of emergency relief will resonate strongly in the light of the terrible images of destruction in the Philippines. However, it is important to be clear about exactly when and how the money should be spent.
All the evidence shows that money spent wisely before emergencies on disaster preparedness, risk reduction and resilience pays huge benefits in mitigating the effects of natural calamities and building the capacity of local people to respond.
