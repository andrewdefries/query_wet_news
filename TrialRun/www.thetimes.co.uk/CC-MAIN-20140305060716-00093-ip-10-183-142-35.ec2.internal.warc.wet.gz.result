Great Mosque under threat from Church
For hundreds of years, the Great Mosque of Córdoba has been a symbol of religious tolerance and coexistance. Built by the Caliph of Damascus in the 8th century, the inside was transformed into a cathedral in medieval times but its original features remain, making it a monument of magnificence to both the Christian and Muslim faiths. However, its religious unity has been put in danger by moves from the Roman Catholic Church to wrest the Unesco World Heritage Site from public control, provoking fears that its Islamic architecture could be at risk.

Twenty-five people who attend a steak dinner at the Lone Oak Baptist Church in Paducah today will walk away with a free handgun, shotgun, or long gun.
The service is the latest in a series of so-called Second Amendment Celebrations held in Kentucky over the past year that try to “point people to Christ” and offer the promise of salvation and the pow
