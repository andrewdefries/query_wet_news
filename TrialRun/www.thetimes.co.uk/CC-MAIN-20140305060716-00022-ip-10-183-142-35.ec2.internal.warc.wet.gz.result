Few artists inspire such adulation as Pina Bausch, the hugely influential choreographer of Tanztheater Wuppertal. Vollmond, which premiered in 2006, three years before she died, is uneven, but so rich are the best of its images and the performances of its dozen-strong cast that you can understand what the fuss is all about.
