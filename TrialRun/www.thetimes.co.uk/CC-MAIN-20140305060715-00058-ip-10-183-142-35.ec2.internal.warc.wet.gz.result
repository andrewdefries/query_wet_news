A test that identifies whether prostate cancer is aggressive or benign has been developed by scientists, who say it could help patients decide whether to undergo surgery. Patients have until now faced a difficult decision of whether to undergo invasive surgery with serious side-effects or risk a “watchful waiting” approach. Most tumours are harmless, so-called “pussycats”, but 10-15 per cent are “tigers”, aggressive cancers that could spread to other parts of the body. The blood test currently used to diagnose prostate cancer is not accurate in distinguishing between the two. Identifying patients who have the most dangerous types of cancer

Philip Hammond, in the midst of a public battle against further reductions to the defence budget, will today announce a £1.8 billion plan to bring 20,000 British troops home from Germany.
The Defence Secretary will say that the majority of the soldiers and their families will be back in Britain by the end of 2016, with the remaining 4,500 returning by 2019 — a slightly faster exit rate than initially envisaged.
Some 4,000 troops have already been taken out of Germany since 2010, ending one of the last enduring legacies of the Second World War.
The soldiers will be distributed around

The US Navy has successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time — showing a computer programme can perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do. The landing of the X-47B experimental aircraft means the Navy can move forward with its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around-the-clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability.
