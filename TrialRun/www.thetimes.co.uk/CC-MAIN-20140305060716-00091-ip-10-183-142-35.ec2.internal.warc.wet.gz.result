Sainsbury’s customers were unable to buy Pepsi-Cola for two weeks after a price dispute with Britvic. The drinks group, which has sold Pepsi in Britain since 1987, had asked the supermarket for a rise of as much as 10 per cent, according to The Grocer. The supermarket refused. As the dispute intensified, Sainsbury’s also put up a sign in some stores saying: “We apologise if you are unable to find any Pepsi varieties. Currently the supplier is failing to supply.” Both Britvic and Sainsbury’s declined to comment on the specifics of the dispute but did confirm that there had been

The city may be steeped in history but because it is not on relocation hit lists a home does not cost a king’s ransom
The city of Worcester was once so renowned, according to one of its cathedral canons, that King John said he wanted to be buried here. His remains were duly delivered and have for centuries since lain at the heart of the building, alongside those of Henry VIII’s older brother, Arthur, and the proud family tombs of drapers and clothiers. The cathedral, which sits grandly above a bend in the River Severn, is still a spectacular sight, but George Pickard, an associate partner at Halls estate agency, says that Worcester today is far less celebrated than it was in King John’s

Hungarian aristocrat who became the daughter-in-law of her country’s ruler, Hitler’s ally Admiral Horthy
Ilona Bowden, née Countess Ilona Edelsheim Gyulai, was the daughter-in-law of Admiral Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya, Regent of Hungary from 1920 to 1944. She witnessed at first hand the falling out between Hitler and his Hungarian ally. When the Nazis toppled the Horthy regime in 1944, Ilona was taken into custody by the SS. In later life she married an English colonel, settled in Sussex and converted to the mystical Islamic practice of Subud.
Ilona Edelsheim Gyulai de Marosnémethi et Nádaska was born in 1918 in Budapest, the third and youngest daughter of Grof Lipót EdelsheimGyulai and h

Chemicals found everywhere from plastic bottles and cleaning products to make-up and pesticides appear to interfere with women’s reproductive systems, causing complications in pregnancy and early menopause, researchers say.
Women exposed to the highest amounts of endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as phthalates or PCBs underwent the menopause about two and a half years earlier than other women, a study found.
Debate is raging over whether to restrict the use of phthalates, which have been implicated in other health problems. PCBs were banned, yet linger in the environment. Experts said that, although there were ways to limit one’s exposure, endocrine-disrupting chemicals were

It felt as though we were in the Mediterranean, not in North Yorkshire in March. Lying on sun loungers next to a heated pool in the courtyard at the centre of the Feversham Arms, we soaked up the rays on a surprisingly warm day. Other guests were doing the same, reading newspapers in swimming costumes and white robes. A wooden hot tub gurgled near the entrance to the spa.
