Nick Candy is to licence his name to developers and hoteliers as part of a global expansion plan for the luxury design company.
The property entrepreneur, best known for managing the development of One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, said he was following in the footsteps of Donald Trump “who was doing this [franchising his name and brand] years ago.”
Mr Candy said that Candy & Candy would go into property markets in big cities through brand licensing agreements with developer and hotelier partners. He is targeting New York, Mumbai, Dubai, Singapore, Jakarta, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Moscow, St Petersburg,

Doreen Lawrence: ‘You can’t trust the police’
Sean O’Neill
Crime and Security Editor
Published at 12:01AM, March 7 2014
Hundreds of political activists could have their convictions quashed after the publication of a report into the conduct of a secret undercover police unit in the Stephen Lawrence case.
The prosecutions of protesters from the far Left and Right, as well as animal rights campaigners, black ­justice groups and Irish republicans, will be checked against the records of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) amid concerns that some were unsafe.
The review will pave the way for a public inquiry into the SDS, which was set up by the Home Office in 1968, learnt its tactics from the intelligence services and evolved into an ­out-of-control wing of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch.
A report by Mark Ellison, QC, into the actions of the SDS in the Lawrence case revealed yesterday that it had placed a “spy in the camp” of the murdered black teenager’s family. Information gathered by that spy was fed back to the upper echelons of Scotland Yard.
Twenty-one years after Stephen’s death, and weeks before new inquests open into the Hillsborough disaster and with the Plebgate affair still rumbling, the latest disclosures are immensely damaging for confidence and trust in the Police Service and the international reputation of British policing.
Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said that Mr Ellison’s findings were profoundly disturbing and a judge-led public inquiry was necessary to get to the full truth.

Ukraine on the brink of breaking up School ‘excluded anorexic girl to prevent copycats’
An anorexic girl who was treated in hospital for her illness was barred from returning to school because it was feared that she would inspire copycat cases, her mother has claimed. Lottie Twiselton developed severe anorexia at the age of 14 when she was a pupil at Northampton High School. She spent a year receiving treatment in an outpatient clinic in London. Despite constant assurance that a place at the school would be kept open for her, when Lottie was discharged from hospital she was told by the head teacher that her presence “would be too disruptive to the rest of the year group”, her mother has said. Lottie, now 16 and studying for her GCSEs at another independent girls’ school, believes that the school “abandoned” her because they feared that other girls would “follow in her footsteps”. “When I was very sick and still at school I felt like I Published at 12:01AM, March 7 2014

SNP Ministers’ attempts to introduce a minimum price for alcohol could be delayed after questions over their legality were raised in Europe.
The European Commission has issued a detailed response to the Scottish government’s proposal for a unit price of 50 pence and the consultation has been extended until after Christmas as a result.
The development casts doubt on whether the measure, which the Scottish government hopes will go some way to addressing the country’s alcohol misuse problem, is legally sound.
Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister, notified the EU about the plans when she was Health Secretary amid fears
