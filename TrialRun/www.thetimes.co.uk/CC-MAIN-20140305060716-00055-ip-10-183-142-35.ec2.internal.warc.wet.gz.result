Yesterday, St Valentine’s Day, was the day on which birds are traditionally supposed to pair for the breeding season
Yesterday, St Valentine’s Day, was the day on which birds are traditionally supposed to pair for the breeding season. Some birds, such as chaffinches and yellowhammers, do indeed choose their mates around this time, but many others have done so already during the winter. Ducks especially get to work early, and seek a partner among the winter flocks on lakes or on the sea. From December, off northern coasts, the soft cooing calls of the black-and-white eider drakes can be heard coming from the water as a group of them swim around a brown female, all of them throwing their

Imagine you began a study into what happened when you flipped a coin. Imagine you conducted 50 tests and in 25 of them it came up heads. Then imagine these were the only tests you published. Something would be clearly amiss.
Something is. In 2009, the previous Government spent £500 million stockpiling an antiviral called Tamiflu as a pandemic of swine-flu spread across the globe. Subsequently there have been claims that Tamiflu is no better than paracetamol. Meanwhile, there are also claims that Roche, the drug’s maker, published fewer than half of the clinical trials conducted on it.
Staggeringly, this

The man the kids call Mofarah is one of the locals now. When his training group runs through Iten, children run out on to the road to chase him shouting “Mofarah, Mofarah”.
“They think it’s one word,” Mo Farah, the Olympic and world 5,000 and 10,000 metres champion, says. “When I run through the village they shout it at me. Then they run along the road with us.”
Farah has been coming to this elevated spot in the Lower Rift Valley of Kenya since 2008. This time he will be here for nearly three months as he converts himself from

Weather Eye: betting on the forecasts
The Met Office has come in for much criticism for their seasonal forecasts. The biggest outcry was the barbecue summer forecast of 2009, when a heatwave was expected, but the summer was a washout. Since then, the Met Office no longer publicises its three-month outlooks, and instead has a forecast designed purely for contingency planners in government, local authorities and so on.
But despite this limited audience, critics have still jumped on the forecast for this winter. As one critic asked, what made the Met Office “forecast in November that a dry winter was almost twice as likely as a wet
Moose can’t take the heat, or cold
North America’s moose population is being decimated, with a huge decline reported in recent years.
In the 1980s, the northwest part of the state was home to about 4,000 of the beasts. Now there are only about 100. In Northeast Minnesota, the population has dropped to 4,300, from nearly 9,000 as recently as 2006. Similar dramatic falls have been recorded in other regions across the US and Canada.
Experts believe climate change may be a factor, with recent milder winters allowing deadly parasites to thrive. Others believe that “heat stress” might have played a part: once the tempe
Weather Eye: the pull of the moon
John Lane, of London, wrote: “Once again this year it may be noted that the advent of the New Moon (Mar 1) is provoking a favourable change in our weather patterns” (letters, March 5).
Ther has been a belief back to ancient times that the Moon plays a role in the weather, and folklore is full of forecasting the weather from the Moon; as one saying goes, “If the moon on a Saturday be new or full, There always was rain, and there always will.”
The Moon helps to pull the tides across the world’s oceans, so why shouldn’t it have a hold on our weather as well? A New Zealander and long-range weathe
Socks still wet? It’s time for a change (in the weather)
If your socks have not had time to dry out after the wettest winter since records began, your luck is changing. Weather weary Britons can put away the wellies and hang up the coats as temperatures of up to 17C (62.6F) are expected this weekend. An incoming wave of high pressure from the South Atlantic will lift temperatures to the mid-teens in southern England on Saturday and Sunday. “The warm weather will be favouring the southern half of the country, which is good news for where the worst of the floods have been in recent weeks,” says Paul Simons, writer of The Times Weather Eye column
Weather Eye: where is mild March?
When is the rain going to stop? After the wettest winter in 248 years of records in England and Wales, there were hopes that March would usher in something drier and calmer. But the rains have carried on falling and cold winds blowing, all of which is putting springtime on hold — as the poet Edward Thomas summed up in The South Country: “It is not spring yet. Spring is being dreamed.”
The blame is, once again, the jet stream, which is passing over the UK and steering depressions off the Atlantic. Usually the path of the jet stream wanders around, but this winter was extremely unusual because
Weather Eye: trick of the light
Galileo was born 450 years ago in Pisa, and among his many achievements was the invention of a temperature-measuring device called a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer. This was a tube filled with glass bulbs of varying mass, and as the temperature changed so the buoyancy of water changed and the bulbs floated or sank, indicating the temperature. Not only did temperature measurements lay the foundations of meteorology, but Galileo’s work also paved the way for the invention of the barometer, by Evangelista Torricelli, his assistant.
Galileo also discovered a strange phenomenon when
Weather Eye: a resident hum
There is a strange noise in Surbiton, a suburb on the southwest outskirts of London. Residents living near the train station have been disturbed by a constant hum that can be heard throughout their homes, day and night, and has driven them to distraction, but no one can pinpoint where it comes from or what is causing it. One resident reported on the Surbiton Forum, “I can only describe it as a white noise and quite low frequency,” whilst another wrote, “I have been putting up with a low resonant hum in my flat for some time now. It’s not coming from my flat though, I’ve turned off all electri
Weather Eye: In like a lion
Today’s weather is largely calm but the next few days are likely to bring a blast of cool, wet and windy weather. As the old saying goes, “March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb”. The outlook is for more wind and rain but also sunny intervals and average temperatures.
Despite the storms, this winter was very mild and is likely to be in the top ten warmest winters in the Central England records dating back to 1659. On Monday there was a high of 14.9C (58.8F) in St James’s Park, London, and spring is bursting out. There have been reports of butterflies such as peacock, small tor
Weather Eye: late cold snaps
During one of the mildest winters on record, much of the country largely escaped snow. Although spring officially begins tomorrow there is a chance of snow today over parts of Wales, the Midlands and southern England.
Sudden bursts of cold at the end of February after a mild winter have happened before — as an old saying warns: “As the days grow longer, the cold grows stronger.” At this time of year the seas around Britain are now at their coldest and bitter winds can sweep in.
Only 10 years ago, the weather flipped from warm to cold in dramatic style. The first half of February 2004 was th
