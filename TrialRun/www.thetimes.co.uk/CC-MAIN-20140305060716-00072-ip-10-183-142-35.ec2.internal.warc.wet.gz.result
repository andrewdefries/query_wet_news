India’s Government is to go ahead with the sale of a stake in the country’s biggest steelmaker, despite a slide in the Steel Authority of India Ltd’s shares to a four-year low.
The sale of an 11 per cent stake in SAIL, which is due to take place on March 20, is expected to fetch up to 35 billion rupees (£425 million) for the Government, which has promised to trim India’s budget deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP next year, from 5.3 per cent this year.
The rating agencies S&P and Fitch have India on BBB-negative watch, the lowest

I flew from Manchester to Brussels with Brussels Airlines and just before I boarded the plane I was asked to hand over my hand luggage rather than take it on the plane with me as I had been intending. It was explained to me that I could collect it on my arrival in Brussels on alighting from my flight.
As I was planning on having my luggage with me it was not locked. On arrival in Brussels and before passengers left the aircraft the baggage handler came in with my wallet and announced that it had fallen out of my

We’re stuck with Abu Qatada because the Government let Strasbourg’s whims trump our law
Yesterday the Court of Appeal upheld Abu Qatada’s appeal against deportation. A cacophony of blame will be directed at judges and at Europe. The truth is that since 2005 successive governments have lacked the will to get rid of this odious man.
The extremist Islamist preacher is wanted in Jordan, where he was convicted in absentia on terrorism charges in 1998. I don’t like trial in absentia, but many democratic countries — such as France — conduct them and we deport suspects there without blinking. Abu Qatada was branded “a truly dangerous individual” by the UK courts, which found he “was at

The ‘Jewish conspiracy’ isn’t the only one Lord Ahmed’s worried about. What about those lizards on the Moon?
While world attention has been focused on the part of Lord Ahmed’s television interview in which he explains that a Jewish conspiracy led to his conviction for dangerous driving in 2008, nobody seems to have taken the trouble to listen on, past the sensational stuff, to the rest of the interview, in which the noble Lord goes on to explain many of his other fascinating and rational beliefs about how the world works. Luckily, I have a transcript:
Interviewer . . . fascinating, Lord Ahmed, and can you tell us the individuals you have in mind when you say “Jewish media tycoons”? Apart

Heart of Midlothian are facing an anxious wait to discover the outcome of the apparent financial collapse of their majority shareholder, UBIG, amid fears it could lead to the club’s relegation from the Clydesdale Bank Premier League.
Reports in Lithuania yesterday said that the investment company had, at its own request, been placed on a list of companies “unable or unwilling to meet their obligations”. The list is published on a Lithuanian government website.
