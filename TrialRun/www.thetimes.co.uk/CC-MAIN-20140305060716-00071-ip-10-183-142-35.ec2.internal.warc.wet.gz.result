Many of the patients are ineligible for free treatment but refuse to settle medical bills, he writes in The Spectator. Mr Thomas, a specialist in surgical oncology at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, says that he has been inundated with tales from whistleblowers after writing another article on the same topic three weeks ago.
