Chris McCorry was knocked down by a motorist in a hit-and-run last April

Hammersmith In the seven years that I’ve been cycling in London I’ve been run over twice. My first accident was in 2007, at a T-junction. A young mother drove out of a side road and knocked me flying into the air. I was lucky — I was only bruised. My last accident was in July, when I was run over from behind by a pair on a stolen moped at a busy gyratory in Hammersmith. I’d been scraped across the road on my right-hand side. I was rather lucky. Mark Poole, 49
Barton Stacey I was run over by an articulated lorry as a boy and was fortunate to suffer only minor injuries. At the time, cycle training did not highlight the hazards associated with long vehicles. Also, cyclists need to ride responsibly: I have often seen cyclists jumping red lights. Thomas Skelton, 30
Manchester I used to use my bike for exercise — training 100 to 200 miles a week — but now I stay off the road as much as I can. I’ve been knocked off my bike twice in the past four years and seriously injured both times. In the most recent accident, the driver of the car left me for dead in the middle of the road on a country lane. Chris McCorry, 26
Belfast I was knocked down by a motorist in a hit-and-run last April. The motorist drove off immediately, leaving me to deal with a broken collarbone. It took me a considerable amount of time to recover, and I’m left with a permanent (and prominent) lump where the break was. Robert Johnstone, 35
Streatham
Last year I was assaulted with a lethal weapon. Three witnesses gave me their details and I told the police. The weapon was a car — the driver drove it into the back of my bike while I was in a bus lane. He honked his horn before doing so, indicating that he knew what he was doing. No action has been taken. Steve Lee, 37
Hackney
I was knocked off my bike by an uninsured driver in Dalston, East London. I had right of way on a traffic light and he hit me at speed, side-on. I suffered a head injury, bilateral fractures to both feet and multiple lacerations across my body. Chris Hendrie, 45
London, E17
Having lived in London for 15 years, I’ve used most forms of transport. The only time I’ve felt in danger is while cycling, and my only injury came as a result of colliding with a pedestrian who’d decided to cross six lanes of traffic without looking before stepping into the road, nor using the crossing near by. Result: a smashed collarbone for me, time in hospital and many further visits. The pedestrian, a teenager, suffered facial injuries. He didn’t even speak to me as I lay in the road in pain, trying to get to my phone to call an ambulance. Almost a year has passed and I’ve yet to fully recover. The non-looking pedestrian is the cyclist’s worst enemy, with motorists a close second. Paul Cundy, 41
Hackney
I am a born and bred Londoner, and have cycled all my life. Aged 11, I took the RoSPA cycling proficiency test. In 2003 I was knocked off my bicycle on the City Road by a van. I suffered a fractured skull and a brain haemorrhage. Despite being left to die by a hit-and-run driver, and CCTV evidence being available, the police took no action. I received no compensation. It took me a long time to return to cycling. Now I ride a bike to commute, to shop, for pleasure and fitness. Cycling forms part of my social life, and I now undertake rides of over 100 miles in Britain and the French Alps. London, and the rest of Britain, desperately needs dedicated cycle lanes, away from other road users. This model is successful in numerous European countries. SIGN UP TO OUR CAMPAIGN NOW
