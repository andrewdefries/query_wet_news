Around the World (1946)
Orson Welles’s youthful hubris took a knock when his Broadway musical extravaganza, based on Phileas Fogg’s exploits, crashed and burnt – despite the presence of four mechanical elephants – leaving the Kane wunderkind in financial ruin. Twang!! (1965)
Lionel Bart, writer of Oliver!, didn’t always get it right. His self-financed Robin Hood spoof Twang!! was then the most expensive flop in West End history, leaving Bart bankrupt. His earlier Second World War musial Blitz! (1962), hadn’t fared much better - when Bart asked Noel Coward what he thought of it, the master had said: “I thought it was a

‘We can’t protect everyone from flooding’
It would be unfair to keep spending large sums of taxpayers’ money protecting the Somerset Levels from flooding, according to the Government’s climate change advisory body.
Defending the Levels will become “ever more difficult” because of more frequent storms and rising seas, and diverting scarce public funds for new defences could be poor value for money in a “largely artificial, engineered wetland landscape”.
The intervention by the Committee on Climate Change came as Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, published a £100 million 20-year plan to protect the Leve
Give cows pills to cut methane
Belching cows and sheep could be given supplements to reduce the methane they emit, scientists say.
Targeting the farm animals could lower Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions and increase the efficiency of livestock operations.
Farm animals are thought to be responsible for a quarter of “man-made” methane emissions. Methane is 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas because it traps more infra-red radiation.
Scientists have identified white clover and birdsfoot trefoil, a leafy legume, as beneficial supplements to give cows and other grazing animals. Professor Mark Eisl
Shut up and listen, minister tells Tories
The Energy Secretary has warned senior Conservative politicians to “shut it” and stop questioning the scientific evidence that man-made emissions are causing global warming.
Ed Davey said that Lord Lawson of Blaby, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher’s government, and Peter Lilley, a Conservative MP and a former Cabinet minister, tried to undermine efforts to cut emissions “every day, if they can”.
He told EurActiv, a Brussels-based news website on EU news and policy: “My recommendation to most politicians who want to talk about the climate is to
Climate change offers hope for Greenland
Climate change is presenting Greenland with a unique opportunity to achieve prosperity and full independence by switching its economy from fishing to mining and oil drilling, the country’s Prime Minister claimed yesterday.
Aleqa Hammond said the retreat of the Greenland ice cap was making it easier to exploit the country’s “nonliving resources”, including the largest deposits of rare earth minerals outside China. She has urged Greenpeace and other environmental groups campaigning to block mineral extraction in the Arctic to recognise Greenland’s right to transform its fragile economy by welc

David Cameron has ruled out enshrining his controversial increase in aid spending in law this year, fuelling fears that he is preparing to ditch the pledge.
The Queen’s Speech next month will omit the promised legislation to fix international development spending at 0.7 per cent of national output, The Times understands.
The decision follows warnings that the Prime Minister would face a mass Tory revolt if he tried to push through an issue that was totemic to his modernising of the party but which is a lightning rod for backbench dissent.
Ministers, led by George Osborne, the Chancellor, are arguing
