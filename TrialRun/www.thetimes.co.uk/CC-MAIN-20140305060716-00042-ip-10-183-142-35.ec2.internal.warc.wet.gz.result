Ministers have appointed a string of “expert advisers” from outside Whitehall in a first step to politicise the Civil Service. The individuals have been put on temporary civil service contracts and will work closely with Cabinet ministers to drive through reforms.

Polaroid, the public’s favourite camera a bygone era, is attempting to reinvent itself for the digital age with a new device that can print photographs as they are being posted on social networks.
