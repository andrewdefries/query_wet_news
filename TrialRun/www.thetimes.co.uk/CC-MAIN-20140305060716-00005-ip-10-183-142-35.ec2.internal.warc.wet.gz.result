GlaxoSmithKline admitted yesterday that its profits for the final three months of last year will be wiped out by legal costs relating to its Avandia diabetes drug, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes in users. The company will record a £2.2 billion legal charge as it settles further claims linked to the drug that was once its second-best-selling product — and hundreds more American lawsuits are still in the pipeline. The £2.2 billion includes the estimated costs of an investigation by the US Attorney’s Office in Colorado into sales and promotional practices for a range of products between

A senior High Court is launching a campaign to promote marriage and reverse the “appalling and costly impact of family breakdown” on children and society at large. Sir Paul Coleridge wants to halt what he calls a “re-cycling” attitude to relationships in which people ditch partners rather than try to make things work — with damaging consequences for millions of children caught up in the family justice system. In a controversial move for a serving judge, he is setting up a foundation to promote marriage as figures show that divorce is on the rise.
The intervention comes on the day solicitors

Notebook: Sometimes this newspaper’s judgments fade with hindsight
One of my holiday books was an excellent history of the London Underground, The Subterranean Railway by Christian Wolmar. I’m just finishing it now. It was pleasing to note that Wolmar used The Times as a newspaper of record, plundering the archives for commentary as the network was built. More disconcerting was how often our judgments were, with hindsight, wrong. Before the first line opened, the paper was sure the Underground wouldn’t work. To believe that people would prefer it to the buses “seemed an insult to common sense” as people wouldn’t wish to “be driven amid palpable darkness through

As Mae West — wise in this, as in so many things in life — remarked: “You may admire a girl’s curves on the first introduction, but the second meeting shows up new angles.” We hope that the return today of Times2 as a pullout section will give you a chance to appreciate its new angles.
It returns as a standalone section by popular demand — only bigger, smarter, funnier, punchier. Like all great revivals, its return will, we hope, enchant readers who have always enjoyed the columns, the features, the wit, the pictures, the passion, the fashion, the arts and the critics,

There will be plenty of doom and gloom around England this morning, plenty of criticism bemoaning their inability to overcome European football’s newest nation, to see off a country of 625,000 people. The clear superiority Roy Hodgson’s side enjoyed in the first half against Montenegro will be forgotten, and the uncertainty of the second period will be picked apart.
Despite Dejan Damjanovic’s equaliser, this felt like an important milestone in the evolution of Hodgson’s England. It was not the triumph for which he would have hoped, but it was the night that, at long last, the national side proved they

A new “snoop-resistant” mobile phone that can encrypt all calls and messages to protect them from spies, hackers and jealous partners will soon go on sale.
The Blackphone is described by its makers as “the world’s first smartphone to put privacy and control ahead of everything else”.
It is part of a growing effort among technology companies to protect personal information and follows revelations from the whistleblower Edward Snowden that American and British intelligence agencies have snooped on millions of people via the internet and their devices.
The Blackphone is the brainchild of Silent Circle, a private communications company founded
