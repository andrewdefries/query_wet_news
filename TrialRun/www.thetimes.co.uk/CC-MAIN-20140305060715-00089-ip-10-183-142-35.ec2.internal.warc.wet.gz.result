THE celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay insists that his four children — Megan, 6, twins Jack and Holly, 4, and Matilda, 2 — eat fish every Friday, for Sunday brunch and at other times in the week. He said: “We always have a fish pie on Fridays and sometimes disguise the fish with peas or spinach and it is very popular. ‘Don’t like’ from the children doesn’t go in our house, they know it is the only thing left to eat.” Ramsay suggests the following recipes for parents to hook their children on fish.A simple fish pieA mixture of

A private surgeon who performed botched spinal operations was reported to his superiors eight years before being struck off, it has emerged.
Colin Campbell Mainds was found guilty of misconduct this month.
