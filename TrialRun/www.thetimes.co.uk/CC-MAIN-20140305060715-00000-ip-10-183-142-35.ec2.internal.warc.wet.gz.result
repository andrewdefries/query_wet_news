Britain has overtaken much of Europe in the race for the fastest broadband speeds and is closing in on the pacesetters from the United States and Japan. The digital divide — the gap between broadband quality in rural and urban areas — has dominated discussion about Britain’s fibre-optic cable networks. With some consumers still logging on at dial-up speeds, it has been tempting to see Britain as a broadband laggard.

It was not the biggest royal wedding of the year, but the happy couple certainly seem happy enough.
In this official photograph released after the wedding of Earl Spencer, the brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, to the charity worker Karen Gordon, the couple look happy and relaxed.
They wed this afternoon in an intimate ceremony at the Spencer family home, Althorp in Northamptonshire, where Diana is buried.
Ms Gordon, who now has the official title of Countess Spencer, wore a white fitted lace wedding dress with a v-neck and carried a streaming bouquet of cream and white

Given that crime writers have a morbid fascination with dead bodies, it should be no surprise that a group of them are helping to raise funds for a mortuary. It will be no ordinary repository of human remains, however.
A “million for a morgue” campaign supported by the likes of Val McDermid, Ian Rankin and Stuart MacBride is aimed at creating state-of-the-art forensic research and teaching laboratories at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (Cahid) at the University of Dundee.
The centre is already renowned for groundbreaking techniques in identifying victims of disasters and mass murders, an

Police had scoured the region for days, deploying bloodhounds and helicopters in the largest manhunt Americans can remember. The grizzly denouement could have been plucked from a Hollywood thriller.
Christopher Dorner, 33, a former police officer who had declared war on his past colleagues, was making a final desperate stand in a mountain cabin. He had been on the run for days, taking hostages to stop those he encountered revealing his whereabouts.

England Under-17, the first international team to be based out of St George’s Park, had their parade rained upon by Portugal at Burton upon Trent yesterday as the perennial youth champions won the St George’s Park international tournament.
