Manchester United will face Chelsea in a mouthwatering FA Cup quarter-final if both clubs progress through their respective fifth-round ties. Chelsea, the defending champions who are looking to win the competition for a fourth time in five years, secured their place in round five with a 4-0 fourth-round replay defeat of Brentford and will face npower Championship side Middlesbrough next.
