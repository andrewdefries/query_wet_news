At first blush, the case for letting Universal Music take over EMI’s recorded music arm is clear. Global music sales collapsed by 43 per cent between 2001 and 2010, while digital sales have not grown fast enough to replace physical sales, which fell by 14.2 per cent in 2010.

Theo Paphitis, of Dragons’ Den, and Karren Brady, the vice-chairman of West Ham United, are “in”, but the big question is should you join them and allow yourself to be automatically signed up to a workplace pension? The celebrities are the stars of a £3.5 million advertising campaign to raise awareness of a savings revolution through which more than 11 million people will be enrolled into a pension over the next four years. There will be the chance to opt out but the ad campaign is there to convince people to stick the course. But if you or a family

Jimmy Savile was “a prolific, predatory sex offender” who “spent every minute of every waking day” thinking about abuse, it was revealed yesterday. The disgraced TV presenter could have been prosecuted for offences against at least three victims while he was alive, had victims been taken more seriously. “This whole sordid affair has demonstrated the true consequences of what happens when vulnerability collides with power. He groomed a nation,” said Commander Peter Spindler, of Scotland Yard’s Specialist Crime Investigations. Savile used his celebrity status to “hide in plain sight”, with 214 criminal offences now recorded against him across 28 police

Is the Champions League final a revolutionary moment in European football, or just one of those things? More the former than the latter.
Barcelona might have been the favourites to win the tournament, but they had only a 36 per cent chance, and a 52 per cent chance of being in the final.

There will be a fight for the presidency of the FIA, Formula One’s governing body, after Jean Todt declared that he will stand for a second term.
There had been widespread speculation that Todt would back away from an election contest with David Ward, the former right-hand man of Max Mosley, the Frenchman’s controversial predecessor. Todt appeared in the paddock at Monza during preparations for the Italian Grand Prix with the message that he has not finished with his mission at the FIA. He said he had waited before declaring he would run until the formal nominations process got under
