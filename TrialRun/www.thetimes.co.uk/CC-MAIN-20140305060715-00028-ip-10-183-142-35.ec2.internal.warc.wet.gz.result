Every three years, the world’s greatest illusionists gather to compete at the ‘Magic Olympics’. Here they face the toughest challenge of their lives . . . fooling an audience comprised of other magicians

John Maynard Keynes said in 1931: “We are today in the middle of the greatest catastrophe — the greatest catastrophe due almost entirely to economic causes — of the modern world.” His words retain terrifying topicality. The greatest economic catastrophe of the postwar world began five years ago today. Its consequences are still with us.
On this day in 2007 BNP Paribas, the French bank, halted withdrawals from three investment funds linked to the US subprime mortgage market. Risky financial products had spread a contagion of bad debts through the banking system. The interbank lending market froze because banks feared that they

Once again, it is time to turn the spotlight on the Barclays Premier League’s goalkeepers after some more fantastic displays between the posts at the weekend. David Marshall, the Cardiff City goalkeeper, pulled off a remarkable stop from Everton’s Nikica Jelavić in the pick of the weekend’s saves, changing direction at the last minute to palm away the Croatian’s deflected header.
