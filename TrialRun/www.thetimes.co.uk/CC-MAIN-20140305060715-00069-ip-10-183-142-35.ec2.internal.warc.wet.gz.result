Small and medium sized-businesses are more confident about their growth prospects than they have been for three years but their risk-averse attitude to investment could scupper the economic revival, according to the company that has its finger on the pulse of the nation’s smallest companies. Sage Group supplies accountancy software to thousands of small and medium-sized businesses and tracks the health of the economy as a result.
