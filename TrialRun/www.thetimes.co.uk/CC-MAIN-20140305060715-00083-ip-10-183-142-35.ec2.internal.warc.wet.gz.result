Two outstanding sitcoms show how parents across the Pond don’t have to behave like defeatist doormats to be lovable
Human beings live by storytelling. We tell and hear political, religious and emotional stories, violent and terrifying, teaching and reassuring. Some tales drive home their truth by making us laugh or cry. Some are long, others miniature (“curiosity killed the cat, the early bird catches the worm”). But we take them in, whether as folk tales, novels, theatre, film, personal reminiscence or party conference speeches (“I met a woman the other day who told me how her life had changed . . .”).

One of the players from Shahid Khan’s NFL team believes that the new Fulham owner will do everything he can to improve the Barclays Premier League club.
