Perry’s third LP is about doing things her way — which, luckily, is perky bubblegum pop.“You’re gonna hear me roar!” she warns sexist industry types on Roar, and her ex-husband Russell Brand can get lost too. “I had to grow up. I wish you would too,” she sings on divorce epic It Takes Two, while on By the Grace of God she expresses her sadness, albeit on a theatrical ballad that’s crying out for a dance routine.

Alex Neil, the Scottish Health Secretary, tried to brush off fears about the state of the NHS yesterday, as new statistics showed that bed-blocking was on the increase.
Mr Neil accepted that patients were waiting too long to be discharged and said he would be the “last person to deny there are pressures in the National Health Service”. He added, however, that it was not all “doom and gloom”.

Barry Tutt waves his arm towards an empty lot. “And this is my place.” He gazes over the mess of gravel and weeds where his house once stood. A chasm runs through his overgrown lawn. “Only the letter box is left now.” Mr Tutt is taking The Times through the earthquake-stricken streets of Bexley, a suburb of Christchurch.

Didier Drogba dedicated the goal which could help Chelsea to a surprise Champions League final at the expense of Barcelona to the critics who said he was too old.
Drogba, 34, netted in the 45th minute to give Chelsea a precious advantage going into the second leg and the striker was quick to turn on the detractors in a post-match interview.
“For those who said that I was too old, they saw that I could run maybe one, two or three more years,” he said.
