US politics live – Rick Santorum ends his presidential bid | World news | theguardian.com 10.30am: Barack Obama travels to Florida today to push his "Buffett rule" in a call for millionaires to pay higher taxes, as US politics awakens from its Easter slumber.Here's a summary of the latest news:• Rick Santorum is resuming his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination after his young daughter was hospitalised last week. Santorum's daughter, Bella, was discharged from the hospital and returned home early Monday evening. The 3 year-old suffers from a rare genetic condition. Responding to the Santorum family's difficult moment, the Romney campaign opted to pull an attack ad it had planned to launch against the former senator in Pennsylvania.• President Obama has overtaken Mitt Romney in a new poll from Washington Post/ABC News. Last month Romney was two points ahead of the president in the same poll, now Obama is up by seven percentage points, 51% to 44% among registered voters.• A campaign leaflet from Santorum's failed 2006 Senate race in Pennsylvania republished by the Associated Press has called the candidate's conservative credentials into question. Titled "50 Things You May Not Know About Rick Santorum," the document highlights how Santorum directed federal money to Pennsylvania and worked with Bono to combat Aids and global poverty. The positions of Santorum 2006 don't quite square with Santorum 2012, who has cast himself as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney.10.40am: A sign that Fidel Castro remains as potent as ever in US politics: the manager of the Miami Marlins, the famously loose-tongued Ozzie Guillén, has just been suspended by his team for five games after he praised Castro in public comments.The Marlins, which has just changed its name to adopt Miami and opened a brand-new ballpark in the city's Little Havana area, have been pummelled for Guillén's remarks, as the Miami Herald reports:Dozens gathered outside Marlins Park to voice their protest to Guillén's comments, some carrying signs expressing their disgust. One turned his body into a two-sided billboard, writing "No excuses – Fire him now" on one placard and on the other, "Mr [David] Samson, Do you still keep Guillén if he had said, 'I love Hitler'?" Samson is the Marlins' team president. Neither Samson nor owner Jeffrey Loria sat next to Guillén during Tuesday's grilling by English and Spanish-language media members. More than a dozen video cameras perched atop tripods lined the back of the room, and the 60-some-odd seats Marlins staff set up for reporters were not enough.In his nine years as a big-league manager, Guillén has spat out insult after insult in his blunt style, offending, among others, gays, opponents of illegal immigration and even fellow Venezuelans.10.45am: What did Ozzie Guillén actually say that was so bad? It was in an interview with Time magazine, which has hidden the interview behind its paywall, and the Miami Herald's 2,000 word article can't bring itself to repeat the remarks – but USA Today gives us the quotes:Usually defiant in the face of criticism, Guillén has instead sounded remorseful and said he's had difficulty sleeping since a Time magazine online story that ran Friday quoted him as saying, "I love Fidel Castro."Later in the story he added, "I respect Fidel Castro. You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro for the last 60 years, but that [expletive] is still here."11am: So Ozzie Guillén, the manager of the Miami Marlins, has made his appearance at a press conference just now to apologise for his praise of Fidel Castro.

Guillén said the reaction left him "sad and embarrassed" – but he also said his comments were misinterpreted by the journalist who interviewed him, and that he neither loves nor admires Castro.It's hard to know exactly how one misinterprets "I love Castro" as comments go. But who can say?
Guillén begins his comments in Spanish, but CNN cuts away because they don't have simultaneous translation. #fail— Jordan Fabian (@Jordanfabian) April 10, 2012 Another great moment in US television, thanks to CNN.11.15am: Newt Gingrich Delusions of Grandeur Watch, part eleventy-twillion.Via the always-excellent GOP12 blog, here's Newt on Fox News drawing parallels between himself and the winner of the Master golf tournament:Yesterday afternoon, I joined millions of Americans in watching the Master's, and the two guys who ended up in the sudden death were, neither one, in first place when the last round began.Now neither of them dropped out.Newt's trouble is that, in reality, the parallel is not between Gingrich and Bubba Watson. The correct parallel is between Newt Gingrich and ... let's see ... Jose Maria Olazabal. Who missed the cut. Just like Newt.11.35am: Barack Obama's "evolving" views on gay marriage continue to be a source of disquiet among some of the president's supporters – with the LA Times reporting on a push to include support for gay marriage in the Democratic party's official platform at the national convention later this year:But some political advisors argue that an election-year epiphany on the issue would be seen as simple political opportunism at a time Obama's campaign is eager to highlight principled decisiveness. And gay marriage remains controversial among at least one major constituency the president needs: African American voters. Pastors of black churches, for example, have led the effort for a referendum in Maryland to overturn the state's new law allowing same-sex marriage.11.52am: The combined effects of the economic downturn and tougher immigration laws has led to what the Christian Science Monitor calls "net zero" migration between Mexico and the US:One million Mexicans said they returned from the US between 2005 and 2010, according to a new demographic study of Mexican census data. That's three times the number who said they'd returned in the previous five-year period.And they aren't just home for a visit: One prominent sociologist in the US has counted "net zero" migration for the first time since the 1960s.It's a complex issue, of course, but this CSM article is an excellent piece of reporting.12.14pm: Memo to Rick Santorum – even Republicans are tired of the Republican presidential non-contest,
