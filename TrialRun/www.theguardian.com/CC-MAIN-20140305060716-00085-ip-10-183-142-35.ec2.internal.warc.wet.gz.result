England v South Africa – second ODI as it happened | Rob Smyth | Sport | theguardian.com Preamble Hello. There were times during Friday's Cardiff rainwatch that it was tempting to wonder whether this would become the first five-match ODI series to end 0-0. But the sun is shining, the weather is sweet at the Ageas Bowl today, and even Mystic Maisie, our fragrant Palms and Tea Leaves Editor, is predicting 100 overs. Woop woop! Come on, woop with me now.The match – or an unexpected thunderstorm or such ferocity as to threaten the space/time continuum and the world's most immovable toupées, never mind our chances of getting 100 overs – will begin at 1pm.South Africa have won the toss and will bat first. That was a fairly straightforward decision on a surface that usually takes turn as the match progresses. The pitch is the reason England have broken the golden rule that you should never change a no-resulting team: Samit Patel comes in for Chris Woakes. That was a very late decision apparently. Poor Woakes. He waits a year for a recall and then gets dropped without facing, bowling or fielding a ball. Maybe his banter stinks or his armpits are unfunny or something. South Africa are unchanged.England Cook (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Bresnan, Swann, Anderson, Finn.South Africa Amla, Smith, Elgar, de Villiers (c/wk), Duminy, du Plessis, McLaren, Parnell, Peterson, M Morkel, Tsotsobe.Lucky ground department Everybody's favourite Irish genius averages 137 in ODIs on this ground. That's not all. Alastair Cook averages 91 here, Ian Bell 87 and Craig Kieswetter 61. So when they all get first-ballers and England lose by 347 runs, you know whose house you should burn down: Statsguru's.In a hilarious development, it's raining. Dear me. I'll never speak to Mystic Maisie again. It's pretty light, however, so we should still start on time.12.53pm Steve Pye has sent in his latest blog, which is about great commentary moments of the 1980s. In the spirit of which, why not nominate your favourite piece of cricket commentary? (With a link if possible.) The less obvious the better, although the instant serotonin of Johnners and Aggers is inevitably our first port of call. This also does unspeakable things to the spine.Here comes the players. South Africa's opening pair in ODIs is Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla. If you think Amla is good in Tests, you should see his ODI record – his extraordinary average of 56.49 is the greatest in history among those from a Test-playing nation who has played a minimum of five ODIs. (Ryan ten Doeschate is above Amla but, brilliant player though he is, most of his games are against Associate sides.) That said, I can confidently assert Amla won't score 311 not out today.1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Smith 1, Amla 0) Jimmy Anderson starts with an excellent over that costs just one run. There is plenty of movement in the air, and Graeme Smith is beaten by a lovely awayswinger fourth ball. As Mike Atherton says on Sky, in a Test match Smith can leave those deliveries all day, but here he has to force the pace and go after the ball even if England hang it wide of off stump. The fifth ball is a fine inswinger that Smith drags for a single.2nd over: South Africa 3-0 (Smith 2, Amla 1) Steven Finn often starts with a very full length in ODIs, happy to invite the drive, but here he goes much shorter, jagging the ball back in to Hashim Amla. Two from the over."This has always been one of my favourites," says William Hardy. "Maybe it's because, as a flighty, mentally weak opening bowler myself, I always felt for him, and less to do with Mark Nicholas." Mark Nicholas had a sensational Ashes series in 2005. It's sacrilege I know, given that Richie Benaud was commentating at the time, but part of me wishes Nicholas had been on for the final ball of the Edgbaston Test. I wonder what he'd have come up with.3rd over: South Africa 7-0 (Smith 5, Amla 2) Amla takes a tight single to mid off but gets away with it because of a slip from Frank Spencer's Samit Patel. Smith is beaten again on the drive. He is walking miles across his stumps to Anderson, so far that you can sometimes see leg and a bit of middle before the ball is bowled. Anderson and Smith have had so many fascinating duels since they first met in the Natwest Series in 2003, a hot young thing with a dubious haircut and an eerily mature 11-year-old who had just been made captain of South Africa.In other news, William Hardy is the only person bothering to email me at the moment – harumph – but it's no problem when he delivers gems like this.4th over: South Africa 8-0 (Smith 6, Amla 2) The sun has reappeared in Southampton. England's fine start continues with Finn angling one past Smith's outside edge and then having a shout for LBW turned down by Simon Taufel. There were doubts over height, line and where it pitched. That aside, as the old joke goes, it was close.5th over: South Africa 11-0 (Smith 9, Amla 2) Anderson beats Smith again – does that thing have an outside edge – before being worked to leg, first for two and then for a quick single to Samit Patel. This has been a fine start from England. "Why isn't Smith captain of SA?" says Elliot Jacobs. I'm not certain, but presumably just to keep him fresh for Test cricket, and also to ease the eventual succession at Test level. It's a miracle that he has done the Test job for almost a decade – look at the average tenure of England Test captains – even before you consider he was one-day captain for eight years. His resilience and longevity are awe-inspiring really.6th over: South Africa 15-0 (Smith 13, Amla 2) There's the first boundary of the innings from Smith, muscled to the left of mid off. Finn knocks the stumps down during his bowling action later in the over, although it's not called dead ball by Simon Taufel. Four from the over. Amla has only faced seven of the 36 balls thus far."I've a special fondness for Athers commentating on Ricky Ponting's early dismissal at Adelaide," says David Hopkins. "I think it's to do with his uncharacteristic bark of excitement, and the way it softly echoed my waking up the neighbours at gone midnight."7th over: South Africa 23-0 (Smith 13, Amla 10) Hardly any emails so far today. Was it something I said? I didn't mean to hurt you, baby. Amla hits the field with a couple of drives off Anderson and then inside edges a filthy slap just past the stumps and away for four. He ends the over with a more deliberate boundary, pinged decisively over midwicket."Here is Richie Benaud explaining what to do when landing on the ball," says Chris Bourne. "No commentator gives better value with fewer words."8th over: South Africa 33-0 (Smith 23, Amla 10) Smith was starting to look frustrated after three more dot balls but gets some oxygen by crunching a rare poor delivery from Finn off the pads and through midwicket for four. He gets four more off the last ball, whapping a low full toss to the trusty midwicket boundary. Ten from the over and 18 from the last two."Richie's world-weary 'That's got to be rock bottom for Rick McCosker' (Old Trafford 77? Couldn't find it on YouTube/Robelinda) summed it up," says Jon Salisbury. Richie's disgust here is a thing of beauty.9th over: South Africa 47-0 (Smith 32, Amla 15) Bresnan replaces Anderson and is edged right through second slip for four by Graeme Smith. There are 14 from the over in total, with Smith savaging a cut into the ground and up over Morgan at point for four more. Another snick through the slips, this time from Amla, brings another boundary. Sir Ian Botham isn't entirely impressed. After making 15 from the first six overs, South Africa have blootered 31 from the last three. "What is amazing about this clip is how David Gower completely regains his composure," says Jon Dean. "We all know how painful this is, but he instantly sounds calm and reasoned. But then at least we do see him slapping Nasser, so it's nice to know he's not always in pure control."10th over: South Africa 49-0 (Smith 33, Amla 16) Finn restores a bit of order with a quiet over that costs just a couple. "A quick question: what is the point of Craig Kieswetter?" says Ed Wilson. "This weekend Matt Prior proved yet again that he can play exciting aggressive cricket, so why not let him ply his trade in all forms? Or do we have a reciprocal agreement whereby we must include a lapsed South African in every team fielded…"Prior has had loads of chances in ODIs and never really done it. That said, I was at Canterbury yesterday and he looked what he is, a class act who is getting better and better. He'll get another go at some stage I'm sure, but for now England think that Kieswetter is a developing young talent (his keeping has improved a lot) who has the rare and vital ability to hit sixes. He has hit 27 in 39 ODIs; Prior has hit six in 68. I don't know that it would be fair to drop Kieswetter at this stage.11th over: South Africa 54-0 (Smith 35, Amla 19) If David Lynch made a film about an English cricket fan driven doolally in the summer of 2012 by his twisted dreams*, that dream would involve Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla scoring run after run after run. They milk five more from Bresnan's se
