Gordon Brown's speech - live | Politics | theguardian.com 12.55pm: Journalists have to create narratives. To make sense of events, and to make them interesting, they have to turn them into stories. (We don't use the word by accident.) And that's why today's speech by Gordon Brown has been widely billed as the most important of his life, a make-or-break event that will determine whether or not he survives as prime minister.In fact, the truth is a bit more complicated. Even if Brown were to deliver a speech worthy of comparison with Martin Luther King, it's hard to imagine Charles Clarke coming out saying: "Sorry, chaps, I got it all wrong. Never mind about the polls. I'm backing Gordon 100%."And, equally, there's no way Brown is going to deliver a speech of such awfulness that it results in David Miliband, or any of the other cabinet ministers who have been backing him in public, popping up on the PM programme at 5pm to say: "It's all over, he's useless, I'm resigning."This speech, on its own, won't make or break Brown. But, alongside the budget (which is as important, but a lot more tedious), the prime minister's speech to party conference is the key defining moment in the British political calender and what we hear this afternoon will have a significant impact on Brown's fortunes over the coming weeks and months.In particular, I think there are five things to look out for.Personality: Brown has been prime minister for just over a year and the evidence seems to be that the voters don't like him. Is there anything he will say or do this afternoon that could change that?Policy: A leader's speech is often the moment when a party unveils big new policies. Labour has already briefed the media about Brown's plans to provide free computers and internet access to children from low-income families. It's commendable, but not a game-changer (and some of the broadcasters today were reporting a negative reaction from viewers). Has Brown got anything else up his sleeve?The Tories: Labour has had trouble finding a plausible way of attacking David Cameron's Tories. Delegates will want to hear Brown condemn the Tories in language that will actually work when employed in election campaigns.Strategy: Brown needs to persuade his party that it can win the election. We know what his strategy is: Sit tight, focus on the economy and hope that the voters reward you for your diligence. But Brown needs to convince his party this will work.Authority: This is the key one, a combination of the other four. At the moment Brown's authority looks diminished. He needs to reassert it.I'll be blogging from the moment the speech starts after lunch, at 2.15pm. Brown's speech should be available soon after he starts speaking from the Labour party website.But you can follow it live with me and I'll give an assessment of how he's performed as soon as he sits down. There will be lots of other instant reaction elsewhere on the website too.2.10pm: You can tell it's starting soon because they're playing, loud, upbeat music in the conference hall. We've just had James's Sit Down, and U2's Beautiful Day.2.15pm: The audience are being told to take their seats. In the press centre there's a huge crowd of journalists at the press desk waiting for the party to release texts of the speech.2.20pm: It's Sarah Brown. What's she doing here? Thought Gordon didn't do the family stuff.2.25pm: We were expecting a video of Barack Obama. But Sarah's a welcome alternative.She's not leader, is she?2.25pm: No, she wants to talk to us. It's a Michelle Obama moment, I think. She's thanking them for the warm welcome the conference gave her and Gordon after their wedding. And she's proud of the motivation Labour has given him. She says they don't spend enough time celebrating what they've done.2.25pm: A video is being shown. It starts with Brown going to the palace, I think. Patrick Wintour tells me it's the same video they showed last year, with references to the minimum wage, the ban on landmines, the ban on foxhunting, extra staff in the NHS, the abolition of section 28, more teachers, free entry to museums - you get the general idea.And London winning the Olympics - wasn't that Tony?2.25pm: Here's Obama: a clip from the Democratic candidate saying Brown has a clear vision of where to take the country.And then a clip of Alan Sugar praising Brown. (You're fired, jokes a colleague.)2.25pm: Sarah welcomes Brown to the stage. A colleague wonders whether anyone is going to write a story about Obama interfering in the British electoral system.2.30pm: Brown's on stage now. He says he's very proud of Sarah. It must be nice to have a job where your wife joins you at work.Purplish tie, for anyone interested in these things.Purple backdrop, too.2.30pm: "Thank goodness Sarah and I are a team. I'm very proud to be her husband."He is going to tell us about who he is, and what he wants to achieve.2.30pm: Leaders often start with a joke. Brown is being serious from the word go.He didn't come into politics to be a celebrity, or thinking he would always be popular. "Perhaps that's just as well."2.30pm: He became an MP 25 years ago because he wanted to serve the country he loves. And he came to London not to join the establishment, but to change it. Sounds like Sarah Palin.2.30pm: He was brought up seeing his parents having to juggle bills. And he wants every child to be able to go to a great school, because he went to a great school.2.35pm: He says he hasn't served his children up in the papers because "my children aren't props, they're people". Quite a sharp attack on David Cameron.2.35pm: Now he's on to an apology. He says it "really hurt" when the 10p tax band "mistake" suggested he wasn't on the side of ordinary families. Because being on the side of "hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be".2.35pm: On to party loyalty now. He does not refer to the rebels directly, but says the British people would not forgive Labour if "at this time we looked inwards".2.35pm: So Brown has now got the personal stuff, an apology and the party loyalty out of the way - all the tricky stuff. Now he's on to his vision for the future.2.35pm: Labour must be the "rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand".Insuring people against risks, and empowering people with new opportunities, is "the mission of the hour".2.35pm: "Those who don't believe in the potential of government should not be trusted to form one." A good soundbite - best so far, I think. The role of the government is perhaps the key dividing line with the Tories these days.2.40pm: The current economic turmoil shows the need for "a new settlement for these times".2.40pm: "A settlement where the rewards are for what really matters - hard work, effort and enterprise."Just as those who believed in the dogma of big government were wrong, so those who believe in the "dogma of unbridled free market forces" have been proved wrong again.2.40pm: Brown's on to his reform proposals for international finance now. I'm not sure the Labour delegates are that interested in the intricacies of the regulation of the international money markets.2.45pm: If Britain makes its changes, London will remain "the financial centre of the world". So the City vote should be sewn up then.The "new settlement" also involves action against climate change, and an end to "the dictatorship of oil". This is certainly a heavyweight menu he's feeding them.2.45pm: It's not just a duty, but Labour's "basic philosophy" to do everything to help people. He mentions the help for people with their fuel bills.2.45pm: But "not even with Harry Potter" can the government conjure up money to pay for everything. That's only the second joke, I think, and it's another weak one. No one's going to be asking who wrote the jokes at the post-speech briefing. But I suppose Brown wants to appear serious. At that, he's certainly succeeding.2.45pm: He's onto empowering again.He says Labour will be the party of law and order. But then he quickly moves on to pensioners, and families.2.45pm: He says he understands concerns about advertising aimed at children. Interesting. But he doesn't flesh it out.2.50pm: He says he understands concerns about advertising aimed at children. Interesting. But he doesn't flesh it out.2.50pm: On to employment. He talks about the three million jobs created.There's a good passage on what this actually means. An extra job is "a dad doing security shifts who can now afford a birthday party for his child".2.50pm: He sounds almost tearful at this point, or sentimental rather, as he describes how policy can change lives.2.50pm: Labour does it not because it makes good photo opportunities - another swipe at the Tories - but because "fairness is in our DNA". Bit of a cliche, that "in our DNA" line now, but it still works well.2.55pm: "It's who we are - and what we're for."He's on to empowering people now. this is not just "the new economic necessity". It's the "modern test of social justice and the radical centre ground we occupy." That's interesting - Labour is not on the left, but on the radical centre ground.2.55pm: He praises Harriet Harman. Ed Miliband, John Denham, Ruth Kelly and John Hutton also get a name check.He's on to personalised personal services now. Children's centres are opening all over the country.2.55pm: He reaffirms his commitment to extending free nursery education to two-year-olds, a policy he first unveiled at the weekend.2.55pm: Labour is still committed to the complete elimination of child poverty by 2020. He says the government will make this a statutory commitment. That's new, I think. It sounds good, but I'm not sure what it will mean in practice.3pm: On to education, and he promises a guaranteed right to personal catch-up tuition for children who leave primary school unable to read, write and count. A colleague says the government has already made this commitment.3pm: And he makes the free internet access announcement briefed yesterday. He praises NHS workers. And he applauds. I suppose he's applauding them, but it looks a bit as if he's applauding himself.3pm: This is a personal mission, he says. He says he told Labour the story in Bournemouth (he pronounces it wrong) last year about how he lost the sight in one eye when he was young. Now he wants to make the point that he almost lost the sight in his second eye then. "At that point my future was books on tape."3.05pm: He sounds genuinely impassioned at this point. Because of the "miraculous difference" a surgeon made to him he's passionate about the values of the NHS.3.05pm: Labour will be the first country in the world to offer universal check-ups for everyone over 40.3.05pm: Moving on to science, he says one third of Britain's Nobel prizes have gone to science research.3.05pm: The £15bn being invested into medical research "will be directed to turning the major advances of the last few years into actual treatments and cures for NHS patients". Eh? Don't they do this anyway?3.05pm: On to cancer. From next year cancer patients will not pay prescription charges at all.This is getting sustained applause.Eventually the government will abolish charges for all long-term conditions. This goes down well to, although Brown says it's dependent on savings in the drugs budget.3.10pm: On to pensioners. The government will bring forward plans to help people stay longer in their own homes, instead of having to go into care. And it will provide "greater protection against the costs of care".3.10pm: These are causes worth fighting for, he says.3.15pm: Back on to crime. The government will create an independent commissioner for victims. That was a proposal in the Louise Casey review of the criminal justice system.On migration, he defends the new points-based system. it's fair to the people who play by the rules.Labour has traditionally been the home of big ideas, ideas that become accepted as the norm: votes for working men, and then for women, anti-discrimination legislation, and more.But "every single blow we have struck for fairness and the future has been opposed by the Conservatives".Under the Tories there would have been no New Deal, no Sure Start etc. "So let's hear no more from the Conservatives. We did fix the roof while the sun was shining."This gets a big cheer. It's a clever inversion of one of David Cameron's lines.He goes on to attack the Conservatives' record over Northern Rock. Some of his claims are suspect. He says that under Conservative policy, there would be no regulation to protect homeowners. He's talking about a John Redwood commission report that Cameron hasn't accepted.3.20pm: But he's got some better anti-Tory lines now, which go down well. "This is no time for a novice," he says of George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, although it could also apply to David Miliband.And their plan is to "to change their appearance to give the appearance of change".3.20pm: He says the Tories would cut services. Brown fought the last two general elections by attacking the Conservatives for proposing drastic public spending cuts and, on the basis of this speech, he's going to do exactly the same next time.3.20pm: And he has a go at the Cameron idea that Britain is "broken". "This country has never been broken by anyone or anything," he says. He made
