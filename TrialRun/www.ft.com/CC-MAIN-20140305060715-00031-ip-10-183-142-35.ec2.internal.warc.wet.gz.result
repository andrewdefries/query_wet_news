Impossible encounters
By Jackie Wullschlager
A seminal 1969 show is brought back to life this year at the Prada Foundation in Venice
©Siegfried KuhnInstallation view of the Kunsthalle, Bern, in 1969“It was a moment without the museum being a bank. No guards, no ropes, no limits, no pedestals – a free moment of improvisation. Today all that energy and participation has been cancelled. Only things that can go into an auction house become art.” Germano Celant, the eminent 73-year-old Italian curator, is talking to me about When Attitudes Become Form, Harald Szeeman’s seminal show at the Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland, which introduced post-minimalist strategies of process art, conceptualism, land art and performance into a museum setting. MoreIN Visual ArtsPawel Althamer The Neighbours, New Museum, New York – reviewArt and Life 1920-1931, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, UK – reviewVikings Life and Legend, British Museum, London – reviewConstable ‘Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows’, National Museum, CardiffIt was 1969 and Richard Serra splashed 210kg of lead in the foyer, Alighiero Boetti placed concrete pieces on the floor to depict “Me Sunbathing in Turin”, Joseph Beuys installed a “Fat Corner”, Lawrence Weiner took a chunk out of the wall, Bruce Nauman laid out “Collection of Various Flexible Materials Separated by Layers of Grease with Holes the Size of my Waist and Wrists”, Alain Jacquet exposed the Kunsthalle’s electrical wires and left them hanging, and “Art by Telephone” consisted of a telephone and a sign reading “When the phone rings, pick up the receiver. Walter de Maria will be on the phone wanting to talk to you”. The show cost Szeeman his job in Bern, but brought international renown. Celant, who gave the opening speech in 1969, is now engaged in one of the most obsessive, ambitious projects of his career: to reconstruct the historic exhibition, grafting it in its entirety – modernist white walls, floors, installations and art objects – on to the splendid baroque frescoed decor of the Prada Foundation’s Ca’ Corner della Regina in Venice. “The ‘impossible’ encounter of the 1918 Swiss building with the 18th-century Venetian palazzo is an attempt to introduce the relationship between things into art history. I think this approach got lost in the recent past due to the shattering caused by the commerce that built up related to collecting,” Celant says. The exhibition launches during the Venice Biennale and its audience will come from precisely that commercial milieu – the collectors, dealers, curators and advisers currently on their annual spring pilgrimage, moving en bloc from Frieze New York to art fairs in Hong Kong and Basel via Venice. There are rich paradoxes here. The structured chaos of When Attitudes Become Form stands as a giant reproach to the smooth packaging of today’s art market – the very market that has tamed the post-minimalist positions of Nauman, Serra et al to make them star turns at fairs and museums.
“The material was from the street, everyone was working in the same room, there were no separate territories. You are in a situation, you play with it, instead of bringing in this product from the studio. Today that would not be possible because of the economic value of the work,” Celant reminisces. “All the concentration was about breaking the role of the museum. Now, in Venice, the modern is the past and the baroque is the present.” The works’ fragile character, plus the contradiction that many of Bern’s subversions became museum trophies – Nauman’s “Various Flexible Materials” is among several pieces now in the collection of New York’s Museum of Modern Art – have made loans difficult, though Celant has replacements where necessary, and artists are collaborating on reconstructions. “The biggest doubt was how to make this a contemporary rather than a nostalgic event,” says Celant. Yet to me the show’s 21st-century resonance shrieks. It is not only that it marks the dawn of a sort of creativity – the breakdown between art media, the emphasis on process-based work – which continues to be enormously influential, and to need curatorial explanations. It is also that Venice – especially this year as it comes hot on the heels of Frieze New York and Art Basel Hong Kong – dramatises an extreme tension in current art: between the commodified and spectacular (François Pinault’s Palazzo Grassi, for example), and the downbeat ideological biennale-speak about migration, displacement, anti-commodity, which is something like its mirror image. The coexistence of these two approaches takes us back to 1960s idealism, when art and politics were not separated like this, and to Szeeman’s radical concept of an exhibition as “not just a group show but a temporary world”. At the start of Celant’s project, Rem Koolhaas, its architect, reckoned it “an irony that an exhibition that was so much about improvisation and artistic freedom would be framed in such classical art-historical terms. In the end, the enforced marriage of the two architectures in the Venetian building was a relief – that there would be an experimental dimension ... I have always been very interested in archaeology, [where] you love to untangle very complex architectural aggregates and layers that all occupy the same space. This project felt like an archaeological project to be untangled by the viewer.”

Apple founder Steve Jobs dies
By Joseph Menn in San Francisco
Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder and former chief executive regarded as one of the most important American business leaders of his generation, died on Wednesday at the age of 56, after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer.
His death was announced late on Wednesday by Apple’s board, which said: “Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve.”

As the news of his death spread thousands of Apple customers and fans of Jobs posted heartfelt appreciations on social networking sites, and tributes poured in from former colleagues and former foes alike.
US president Barack Obama led the tributes. “By building one of the planet’s most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity,” Mr Obama said.
“Steve was among the greatest of American innovators – brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it,” the president said in a statement.
“Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world.”
FT Tech Hub: Remembering Steve
A look at the tributes flooding in from around the world After returning to lead the Silicon Valley group in 1997 Jobs built Apple into the world’s leading consumer technology company before resigning as chief executive in August of this year and handing over to current chief executive Tim Cook, his longtime deputy. Jobs had been battling a recurrence of cancer since being diagnosed in 2004. During the second of three medical leaves, he received a donor’s liver in a transplant operation two years ago. He is survived by his wife Laurene and four children, as well as his sister, the novelist Mona Simpson, with whom he was reunited as an adult.
Jobs co-founded Apple Computer in 1976 with his longtime friend Steve Wozniak and also founded Pixar, the computer animation company later sold to Walt Disney.
In a letter to investors at the time of his resignation as Apple chief executive, Jobs said: “I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.”
Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, where Jobs was a director and the largest individual investor, said: “Steve was such an original, with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era.”
Though his name was on many Apple patents, he borrowed, bought or popularised other ideas closely associated with the company’s rollercoaster fortunes. He eschewed market research and served as a one-man focus group, colleagues said.
He insisted on total control over Apple hardware and software – not as a designer himself but as a fan, ordering products he wanted to use.
“He’s someone who had amazing taste and could get great work out of other people”, said biographer Leander Kahney, who edits Cultofmac.com, a daily Apple news website.
Interactive Timeline
Steve Jobs at Apple
Key moments over the last 40 years
“The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,” Bill Gates, Microsoft founder, said in a blog post. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honour. I will miss Steve immensely.” Jobs learnt business tactics only because he had to. After he lost a power struggle and left Apple in the 1980s, the company floundered until it reached the brink of bankruptcy. His return in 1997 began a historic corporate comeback that accelerated with the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad, which was introduced last year but already brings in more revenue than the company’s Mac computers.
After permanently upsetting the balance of power in the music and phone industries, Apple’s tablets are now dramatically shaking up the computer industry, where Mr Jobs began. The performance has made millionaires out of many Apple employees and even large ordinary shareholders, who briefly saw the company become the world’s most valuable earlier this year. In stock capitalisation, it is now behind only Exxon-Mobil.
