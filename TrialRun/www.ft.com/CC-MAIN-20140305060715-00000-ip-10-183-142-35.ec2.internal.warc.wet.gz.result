Melbourne Business School wins in merger battle with university
By Della Bradshaw
Melbourne Business School has completed its merger with the faculty of business and economics at the University of Melbourne, to create one graduate business school. The announcement follows years of wrangling between the university-based faculty of business and economics and the business school, which is a strong provider of executive education through its Mt Eliza brand, and which was set up by Australian business. The business community will retain 55 per cent of the shares of the enlarged MBS, with the university holding just 45 per cent.

MoreIN Business School News Mooc matters EFMD looks to the strength of the alumni network IMD professors top Oscars of the business school world The Academic Week AheadOne of the undoubted winners of the re-organisation is Zeger Degraeve, who will both continue as dean of Melbourne Business School and become one of two deans of the faculty of business and economics, alongside Paul Kofman, who will continue in the job.
University Vice-Chancellor Professor Glyn Davis, vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, said the agreement was a return to MBS’s origins. “Melbourne Business School was once the sole provider of graduate education in business and economics at the University, and now it is once more....MBS has gone from a very small, influential and powerful school to a much larger school.” As sole graduate school for business at the university, MBS will teach more than 30 graduate programmes, including the flagship MBA, as well as executive short courses.
