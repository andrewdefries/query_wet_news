Dr. Deak has spent more than 20 years as an educator and psychologist. The latter half of that period has focused on working with parents and teachers in their roles as guides for children. On her Web site is a quote that best describes her perspective: "Every interaction a child has, during the course of a day, influences the adult that child will become."
Dr. Deak began her career as a teacher. She soon learned the complexity of dealing with the many brain and motivational patterns represented by the diverse students in her classes. This led to her work at Kent State University, one of only three universities in the United States to have a specialty in Preventive Psychology. Her doctoral work focused on how to assess those environmental, school, and family patterns that lead to the healthy development of children and, conversely, those patterns causing issues, problems, and disabilities.

Three Iron Truths of the (Not-Fine) Recovery By Jim Tankersley, National Journal The U.S. economy is not doing fine. Not in the private sector, and especially not in the public sector. President Obama was wrong to say otherwise – that the private sector is fine – last week. Mitt Romney was wrong to suggest laying off teachers and firefighters hasn’t hurt. And congressional Republicans are wrong to say the whole situation would improve if we just had more “certainty” around taxes and regulations.

Obama Campaign’s Rough Patch Concerns Some Democrats By Karen Tumulty, Washington Post Is it time for Democrats to panic? That’s what a growing number of party loyalists are wondering, amid a rough couple of weeks in which President Obama and his political operation have been buffeted by bad economic news, their own gaffes and signs that the presumed Republican nominee is gaining strength.

Dems, GOP Warily Eye News of Falling Family Wealth By Charles Babington, Associated Press Democrats and Republicans are wary of trying to exploit a new report about the sharp drop in household wealth over the past 20 years. The economic report, released just as the presidential race is heating up, was stunning: The Great Recession shrank Americans’ wealth so much that, in 2010, median family net worth was no more than it had been in 1992 after adjusting for inflation.

Does Leaking Secrets Damage National Security? By Tom Gjelten, NPR Last week's assignment of two federal prosecutors to investigate disclosures of national security information might have been the first shot in a new war on leaks. The director of national intelligence is expected soon to announce new measures to fight unauthorized disclosures, and some members of Congress say it could be time for new anti-leaking laws.

Commerce Secretary Takes Medical Leave After Hit-and-Run Crash By Adam Nagourney and Helene Cooper, New York Times It began Saturday afternoon at a railroad crossing in a run-down commercial neighborhood in suburban San Gabriel, on a street bustling with signs in Chinese characters. A man in a Lexus rolled into the back of a Buick waiting for a train to pass. Two miles and five minutes later, the Lexus smacked into the rear of yet another car, in neighboring Rosemead.

Not Jeb Bush’s GOP By John Dickerson, Slate Jeb Bush does not want to be vice president. That’s what he says when he's asked directly, but he really proves it when he’s talking about everything else. On issues from budget policy to leadership style to immigration, Bush, one of the most popular national Republicans, is a man out of step with his party. This does not mean he likes President Obama. He wants him out of office.

Obama's Re-Election Woes With John Harwood, CNBC Depending on what degree the European crisis hits U.S. exports, and depending on the severity of the so-called fiscal cliff, the U.S. GDP could face a huge decrease.

Ohio's Job Growth Doesn't Guarantee an Obama Win By Charles Babington, Associated Press The nation's unemployment rate of 8.2 percent may sink President Barack Obama's re-election bid, but one detail brightens his hopes. About 10 battleground states will decide the election, and seven of them have employment levels that beat the U.S. average.

Scott Walker, the Motorcycle Daredevil of the GOP By Beth Reinhard, National Journal Scott Walker was proven right. In sporting terms, the man who will remain Wisconsin's governor literally bet his house on the premise that his sweeping antiunion measures would survive--and he along with them. He was willing to sunder his state, subject its residents to almost ceaseless turmoil, and force opposing sides to spend millions of dollars in combat to see his gamble through.

A Bad Week for Obama and the Democrats By Dan Balz, Washington Post All you need to know about the week the Democrats just had can be summed up by noting that both President Obama and former president Bill Clinton, the two best campaigners their party has seen in decades, had to clean up verbal messes they’d made earlier. And, oh yes, Mitt Romney’s campaign raised more money last month than Obama’s — by more than 25 percent.

A 'Fine' Mess. Even Obama Loyalist Winces at Obama's Take on Private Sector By Major Garrett, National Journal When Jared Bernstein, Vice President Biden's former top economist, began reviewing notes of President Obama's press conference on Friday, he stopped cold when he read "the private sector is doing fine." "It caught my eye," Bernstein told National Journal. Bernstein immediately fired off an email to the intern who took the notes to make sure it was accurate and not a rough or garbled translation. "I thought, 'Did he really say that?'" To his dismay, the intern wrote back that those were Obama's words. Verbatim.

Great Performances . That's Dancin': Fosse on Broadway . "Chicago" | PBS
page: 1 2 3 4 June 3, 1975
46th Street Theatre
Bob Fosse
Bob Fosse
John Kander and Fred Ebb
Bob Fosse's near-heart attack one week into rehearsals for "Chicago"
put a morbid spin on an already morbid production. Based on a play by
Maurine Dallas Watkins, the story is set in Chicago in the 1930s,
when vaudeville theaters were filled with freakish sideshow acts. The
main characters, Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, stand accused of murder
and attempt to parlay their criminal notoriety into show business
careers.
Fosse made an almost complete recovery from his bypass surgery, but many of his colleagues noticed serious changes in his creative persona. "Chicago" poster.
