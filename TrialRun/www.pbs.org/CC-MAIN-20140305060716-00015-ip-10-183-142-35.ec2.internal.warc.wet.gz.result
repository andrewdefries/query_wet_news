Bush's arrives at the Summit of the Americas in Mexico, experts discuss U.S.-Mexican relations. Sept. 15, 2003: The World Trade Organization conference in Cancun collapsed when delegates from developing nations walked out. Jan. 4, 2002: Assessing the United States' relationship with Latin American nations. RAY SUAREZ: Thirty-four leaders, from Canada to Chile, with diverse and often conflicting priorities, concluded a two-day summit today in Monterrey, Mexico. For his part, President Bush promoted democracy and anti- corruption efforts, and he urged a hemisphere-wide free trade zone by 2005.PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Trade is the most certain path to lasting prosperity. The openness of our market is the key driver of growth in the region, and a testament to the United States’ belief in the mutual benefits of trade.RAY SUAREZ: But not far away, hundreds gathered to protest the U.S. free-market vision. In fact, across Latin America, there’s been growing resistance to U.S. economic and foreign policy. Mexico and Chile opposed the Iraq invasion at the U.N. Brazil ushered in a left-leaning president critical of the global economy. And protesters in Bolivia and Argentina ousted leaders perceived to be aligned with corporate interests and the International Monetary Fund. But the most vehement U.S. foe is the Venezuelan president. Hugo Chavez has resisted U.S. criticism of his close ties with Cuba’s Fidel Castro. And Sunday, Chavez blasted national security advisor Condoleezza Rice, after she endorsed a Venezuela recall vote against Chavez.PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ (Translated): Let’s prepare President Bush’s security adviser a reading and writing comprehension course for adults to see if she can learn how to read.RAY SUAREZ: Brazil, South America’s dominant economy, has led the opposition to the Bush trade plan, which was endorsed by the summit. But Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, known as Lula, helped delete any language setting a firm deadline. Lula’s government is also fingerprinting American visitors to Brazil, a retaliation against a similar U.S. measure for foreign nationals.Argentina’s president, Nestor Kirchner has opposed any automatic alignment with U.S. policy. He’s also under fire from Washington for warm ties to Castro. There have been economic crises across South America; Argentina’s has been the worst. Deadly riots broke out three years ago, when the indebted government limited citizens’ bank withdrawals. One country that’s aligned itself with the U.S. is Colombia, the region’s largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.The hundreds of millions of dollars a year have helped President Alvaro Uribe’s government aggressively fight rebels, rebels allied with cocaine growers. But the U.S.-backed anti-coca campaign has been very unpopular in Bolivia. Last fall, coca growers led a broad opposition that toppled pro-U.S. President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.By day’s end, President Bush was to meet one-on-one with many Latin American leaders. A key exception: Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez.RAY SUAREZ: For more on the America’s summit, we get three views. Mark Falcoff is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and has written widely on Latin America. Moises Naim is the editor of Foreign Policy Magazine and the former minister of trade and industry of Venezuela. And Robert Pastor is a professor of international relations at American University, and author of numerous books on trade and Latin America. He served on President Carter’s National Security Council staff.Well, Gentlemen, the meeting broke up just a few hours ago with both blasts for Bush and the United States over free trade and an acceptance that the free trade of the Americas negotiations remain on track working toward a 2005 deadline. What do you make of that, Mark Falcoff?MARK FALCOFF: Well, I suppose diplomatic protocol because I don’t think anyone that observes the hemispheric scene thinks that we’re going get to the 2005 deadline. That’s only a little over a year from now. I think we’re very far behind schedule in this process; we may be behind it for another ten or fifteen years.RAY SUAREZ: The date as a goal, as a barrier, was sort of removed by common agreement. Does this mean that the FTAA remains just a polite fiction amongst these negotiators or is this a real thing that still has a real shot?ROBERT PASTOR: Well, they still have agreement on the date based on the previous summits but I think Mark is quite right that the differences now are so huge and the political will seems so miniscule that they’re unlikely to achieve that within a short period of time. I think the one great dissatisfaction that was evidenced by the Latin Americans was that perhaps trade is not enough, that trade is not the path to development, that something more than trade is needed.And unless the leaders can find a way to define that alternative as the European Union did, then I think the prospects of completing the free trade area of the Americas will not be good.RAY SUAREZ: Moises Niam, why that split vision, both blistering criticism of the American ambitions to reach a free trade area of the Americas and an agreement to keep working on it?MOISES NIAM: Latin Americans are not alone in having increasing doubts about the benefits of free trade. If you look at the debate in the United States, there is increasing, even though the United States is the main beneficiary of free and open trade and investment, there is an increasing doubt about the benefits.All of the Democratic candidates, the individuals aspiring to be candidates, are questioning and criticizing free trade. So free trade has acquired, unfortunately, a bad name. And It’s becoming a political lightning rod for a lot of negative reactions. But at the same time there is the sense that that’s one way to follow and that countries that are open to trade do better. So that’s the contradiction.RAY SUAREZ: President Bush has just left, is on his way out of Monterey. Is it the case, Mark Falcoff, that the only bright spot is the meeting with President Fox of Mexico –MARK FALCOFF: Well, that was certainly a bright spot because, to put it mildly, President Fox has not been high on President Bush’s list and vice versa for the last year-and-a-half. So the initiative that the president announced in immigration may not meet all of the — I know it doesn’t meet all of the desires of President Fox or the Mexican political class but it is a move forward that had to please Fox because he’s been rapping on our door on this subject ever since he took office — in fact even before he took office.RAY SUAREZ: Do you agree, Robert Pastor?ROBERT PASTOR: Yes, I think immigration has been a centerpiece in Fox’s agenda to the United States, and I think the decision on the president’s part to suggest a proposal, although a very weak one, and not really satisfactory and indeed doesn’t really address the central issue of U.S.-Mexican relations, which is the development gap.Unless that development gap is reduced, illegal migration will not be reduced. This proposal won’t do it. But at least putting the proposal out before gave President Fox and President Bush a chance to say nice things about each other after two years in which there was a real strain in the relationship.RAY SUAREZ: Moises Niam, the last time these leaders met was before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City. How has the world changed for Latin America and for the United States since then which may have changed the way this meeting went along?MOISES NIAM: Yes. Latin America was always thought to be the backyard of the United States. After Sept. 11, it became Atlantis, the lost continent. And the maps that are usually thought about in Washington, Latin America does not figure prominently. Latin America does not have Islamic terrorists. It does not have nuclear weapons. It is not part of the big security concerns that are now driving everything. And it has been displaced by other emergencies and distractions that Washington has as its main priority.Latin America did not only disappear from Washington, it also disappeared from Wall Street. And attention and investments to the region also dwindled significantly. Where Latin America has not disappeared but increased significantly is in the streets of the United States. It may not be in the maps that Washington policy makers look at and investment destinations for Wall Streeters, but it is in the streets and corners and supermarkets everywhere.Last year, as you know, Hispanics became the largest minority in the United States. And they will continue to grow significantly. Their purchasing power of Hispanics is increasing by $1 billion a week. And very soon that will also become a political — will have some political significance. There is no doubt, for example, that President Bush’s recent reforms, recent proposed reforms for migration policies are not completely independent of electoral calculations.RAY SUAREZ: So, Robert Pastor, Moises suggests that Latin America has disappeared from the maps used in government, disappeared from Wall Street but appeared on the streets of the United States. How does that change the way, the calculus that’s being done in America about these places and in these various countries about how to deal with America?ROBERT PASTOR: Well, U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America in the last week seems to focus on Mexican workers in the United States and Cuba, two very political issues. We’re seeing through a political lens, but I think historically the United States has always stepped back and understood the importance of the region as a whole. That’s what the free trade area of the Americas is about.That’s what democratization in the hemisphere is all about. That’s what the importance of North American community is all about. I think we have been focused on the Middle East for the last two-and-a-half years but we will need to return to the Americas before too long if for no other reason because as Moises points out there is now a growing presence that says we need to take our hemisphere more seriously.RAY SUAREZ: Well, Latin American leaders are sometimes heard to complain, Mark Falcoff that they find it difficult to get a hearing in Washington. Are they right in 2003 and what difference does it make?MARK FALCOFF: Well, look, it would be unrealistic to assume after 9/11 that all of a sudden the United States was going to completely forget about the war on terror and Afghanistan and Iraq and simply focus on Latin America. That’s just not realistic. I mean no president of either party is going to do that in that kind of context. That’s something that the Latin American political class will simply have to come to terms with.That much said, all of the Latin American presidents that have met with President Bush, and that includes very specifically the Brazilian president, have said that they had a very much better impression of him face to face. Lula said he’s a lot better in person than on television is the way he put it. I’ve talked to people that have traveled with various presidential delegations that have come up here. I think when the president does focus on this subject, he impresses these leaders very favorably.RAY SUAREZ: Is there a risk for the United States in taking a crisis, an avoidance attitude, just responding when Argentina blows up, just responding when Venezuela is shutting off the oil taps rather than –MARK FALCOFF: I don’t know how to answer that, Ray. I think that –I will try to answer it anyway. I think that there are two ways of looking at U.S. policy. One is the spectacular events that we see on television where presidents meet other presidents, people come to Washington, the president goes to Latin America.The other is the day-to-day business of policy. And I think the day-to-day business of policy does continue. What we haven’t had is the kind of high-level visible priority that we’re seeing now in the summit, which by the way wouldn’t have taken place at all probably if it weren’t for the fact that it already wasn’t on a schedule determined a long time ago.RAY SUAREZ: Dr. Naim, you heard Professor Pastor talk about the development gap being the real hidden issue — perhaps less talked about but still there. What do these states in Central, South America, Mexico need to close that development gap?MOISES NIAM: There is no silver bullet. And we have learned that there is a lot of dangers in experimenting in the — Latin America has been subjected to all sorts of experiments in the last 40 years. And now it finds itself with a very uneasy insertion into the international system. Its labor is too expensive to compete with China. Its technology is too backward to compete with the technology industries.It is subject to constant shocks: Financial shocks, changes in the prices of the raw materials it exports. Poverty is increasing. And inequality is legendary. It’s the worst in the world. There’s no other region in the world where inequality is as deep as in Latin America. And there is a need for a deeper thinking. I think there is a need to break the peaceful co-existence with normalcy. People have grown accustomed to just accept the situation. And I think we are seeing and we are beginning to witness how in country after country there is a breakdown of the peaceful co-existence with normalcy.People are rebelling, and the politics of rage, of race, of revenge are emerging everywhere from Bolivia to Venezuela to even places in Central America and the Caribbean. The problem there is that the politics of normalcy can be and have been replaced in some places by the politics of lunacy.So instead of you denounce the policies of the past that have not functioned but you replace them with some very strange views that we know are dead ends to development that will not solve the problems and will not decrease poverty and inequality but rather will increase them even though they sound very appealing and very sensitive to the cause of the poor at the end of the day they increase the number of poor.RAY SUAREZ: Moises Niam, Robert Pastor, Mark Falcoff thank you all.

Courtesy: Tom Bearden.Every few years massive fires sweep through America’s western forests, turning green mountainsides black. Over the past three decades, those of us who work in the PBS NewsHour’s Denver office have watched timber burn in California, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah.We’ve seen several small towns and thousands of homes destroyed, uncounted families rendered homeless in a matter of hours. A common thread running through all of those stories is the hardship faced by the people who are displaced. Imagine getting an automated phone call telling you that you have an hour to evacuate, and being able to take only what you can cram into your car. Imagine not knowing for days whether you’ll have a home to go back to. Imagine returning to the ruins of your home and raking foot-deep ashes in the hopes of finding something to salvage. That’s what it was like for the Jalbert family in Los Alamos, N.M., in May 2000, and for many others we’ve interviewed.Fire chased Bud Yearsley out of his home in Montana in August 2000. At that time, he had no idea when he might be able to go back.Nicole Flannery faced the same agonizing uncertainty when we interviewed her in Fort Collins, Colo., last Tuesday. Her family is one of hundreds who were forced out of their homes last week when the High Park fire roared to life. Smoke turns red in the afternoon sun from the Rodeo-Chediski fire in Show Low, Ariz., 2002. Courtesy: Tom BeardenIn 2002, the enormous smoke plume from Rodeo-Chediski fire turned mid-day sunshine into red gloom in the town of Show Low. Not far away, hundreds of people crowded into a shelter set up in a high school football stadium. Evacuees in Colorado and elsewhere will be facing similar loss of privacy in shelters in several states tonight. Hundreds more will bunk with relatives, or stay in motel rooms that many can’t afford anymore. For communities affected by fire, it can take years for businesses to recover. Patti McMillan’s trading post in Red Feather Lakes, Colo., is already losing business, and she’s worried that tourists won’t come back for a long time.Despite decades of debate over the many issues and policies at play in forest management, a national consensus about how to prevent more stories of hardship, loss, and death still seems very far away.How has wildfire affected you and your community?

Synopsis
This is democracy — Japanese style. Campaign provides a startling insider's view of Japanese electoral politics in this portrait of a man plucked from obscurity by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to run for a critical seat on a suburban city council. Kazuhiko "Yama-san" Yamauchi's LDP handlers are unconcerned that he has zero political experience, no charisma, no supporters and no time to prepare. What he does have is the institutional power of Japan's modern version of Tammany Hall pushing him forward. Yama-san allows his life to be turned upside down as he pursues the rituals of Japanese electioneering — with both tragic and comic results. A co-presentation with the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM). (53 minutes)

First feature docu by Gotham-based filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda is a wry, fly-on-the-wall look at local politics, Japanese style — and in particular, the mighty machine of the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The result is an insightful, ironic portrait of campaigning at street level.” — Derek ElleyVariety Read full review » Related Films

Verdict is in: Obama levels more personal attacks By John F. Harris and Alexander Burns, Politico A crabby, negative campaign that has been more about misleading and marginal controversies than the major challenges facing the country? Barack Obama and Mitt Romney can both claim parenthood of this ugly child.
Read more
Platforms reveal deep divide on hot-button issues By Major Garrett, National Journal While the economy dominates this presidential election, issues such as abortion, immigration, regulation, and—in a sudden and startling reversal of Democratic platform language—God and Israel, have added a dose of intrigue to the conventions.
Read more from National Journal
Biden’s speech likely to spotlight strengths, or foibles By Peter Baker, The New York Times Folksy and loose, passionate and sometimes off script, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrives onstage Thursday night as the president’s most important political partner, policy enforcer, conscience, scold and occasional albatross.
Read more
4 years later, scarred but still confident By Peter Baker, The New York Times He warned them in 2008, and when he formally opened his re-election campaign in May, he put it in his speech again. He will “never be a perfect president,” he said, a line he now repeats at stop after stop. The unspoken subtext: It’s not my fault if you didn’t listen or expected too much.

Clinton delivers impassioned plea for Obama second term By Jeff Zeleny and Mark Landler, The New York Times Former President Bill Clinton and President Obama hugged onstage Wednesday night after Mr. Clinton delivered an impassioned plea on behalf of Mr. Obama’s re-election, the 42nd president nominating the 44th to a second term with a forceful and spirited argument that Democratic values would restore the promise of the middle class.
Read more
Bill Clinton offers forceful defense of Obama’s record By Dan Balz and Philip Rucker, The Washington Post Former president Bill Clinton delivered a spirited defense of President Obama’s handling of the nation’s struggling economy here Wednesday night, criticizing the agenda and philosophy of Mitt Romney and accusing the Republican Party of ideological rigidity and an unwillingness to compromise.

Obama didn't stop the middle-class free-fall By Jim Tankersley, National Journal The middle class in America today is not better off than it was four years ago, not better off than it was at the end of the Great Recession in 2009, not even better off than when President Clinton left office in 2001.
Read more from National Journal
‘Are you better off?’ The answer is less clear than it was in 1980 By John Harwood and Mark Landler, The New York Times When Ronald Reagan asked voters a week before the 1980 election whether they were better off than four years earlier, he turned a race that had been nip-and-tuck for months into a landslide victory — and showed how a pointed question can be a lethal political weapon.
Read more Can Obama break D.C. gridlock if re-elected? By Alexis Simendinger, Real Clear Politics Polarized, gridlocked, uncooperative, partisan, impossible. That's how Democrats -- including some of President Obama's past and current White House advisers -- described the nation's capital during several moderated discussion sessions Tuesday at the party's convention here.
Read more Dispatches from the Democratic National Convention By John Dickerson, Slate Magazine Barack Obama has said that his biggest mistake in office is that he hasn't told the right story to the American public. Maybe he should have let his wife tell it. First lady Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and deft defense of her husband, wrapping him in biography and the American story. She also started the process of rebutting the previous week's attacks.
Read more First lady Michelle Obama lauds husband’s values, vision By Karen Tumulty, The Washington Post First lady Michelle Obama declared Tuesday that her husband’s record in office has proved his values, his vision and his courage, as the Democrats opened their convention here with a wide-ranging appeal to the diverse constituencies and interests they must bring out in force to reelect the president.

Dems' time to shine at DNC convention By John Harwood, CNBC Read more
Obama team sees convention as paving way to victory By Alexis Simendinger, Real Clear Politics President Obama and his campaign team believe a successful Democratic National Convention can help plow a path to victory in November. Having experienced the same phenomenon in Denver four years ago, they hope to bottle convention magic one more time.
Read more
For Michelle Obama, a new image but an old role By Beth Reinhard, National Journal When Michelle Obama spoke at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, she was warily viewed as a woman proud of her country “for the first time” and caricatured by The New Yorker as an Afroed and armed rebel soldier.
Read more from National Journal
Republicans try to counter Democrats' convention By Sam Youngman, Reuters Republicans prepared a counterpunch to the Democratic National Convention this week by introducing their new line of attack with a not-so-new question: "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"

Obama makes detour to visit hurricane site By Jackie Calmes, The New York Times President Obama took a short detour from campaigning on Monday to inspect the damage wrought by Hurricane Isaac last week and the government response, a stop that took on outsized political overtones in this campaign season.

Aug 31, 2012
Democrats outline convention schedule By Helene Cooper, The New York Times Just when it seemed as if there could not possibly be any more red, white and blue speeches ringing across the airways from the convention floor, the Democrats are unveiling their counterpunch to the Republican show that has been under way all week in Tampa.
Read more
Obama team sharpens attacks on rivals’ character By Jackie Calmes, The New York Times As the Obama campaign heads into its convention next week, Democrats see openings both to fill in unpopular details of Mitt Romney’s agenda left unsaid by Republicans in Tampa this week and to raise new questions about Mr. Romney’s character after widespread criticism of misstatements by him and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan.

The risks of Romneynomics By Jim Tankersley, National Journal It’s not 1981 in America. Three decades after the Reagan Revolution, the country’s economic problems have evolved. Economic data show this clearly — and so do polling data.
Read more from National Journal
Dispatches From the Republican National Convention By John Dickerson, Slate Magazine For those who didn’t think that Mitt Romney has had to overcome obstacles: Clint Eastwood. The actor’s 12-minute turn onstage at the Republican Convention was rambling and distracting. He spoke to an empty chair in which he pretended the president sat. A few times he pretended the president had suggested he and Romney have intercourse with themselves. Obama spokesperson Ben Labolt suggested that, as counter-programming, the Democrats next week would have Salvador Dali. President Obama got in on the fun by tweeting a picture of himself sitting in the Roosevelt Room chair. (This seat’s taken.) The convention that had seemed snakebit at the start, with Hurricane Isaac and tropical storm Todd Akin, appeared to be ending on the same cursed note.
