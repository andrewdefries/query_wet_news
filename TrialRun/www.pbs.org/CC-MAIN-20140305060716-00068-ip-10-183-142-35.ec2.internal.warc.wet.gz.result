Barcamps in Bolivia and Madagascar
by David Sasaki
Tellingly, when you search for “barcamps“ on Google, the first location-specific reference is not San Francisco, Boston, or Seattle. No, it’s Bangalore, once known for its large British military station, and today the so-called Silicon Valley of India. BarCamp Bangalore has already held six events over the past couple years, starting in April of 2006. [...] more »

Trailer The Boys of Baraka
African-American boys have a very high chance of being incarcerated or killed before they reach adulthood. In Baltimore, one of the country's most poverty-stricken cities for inner-city residents, the Baraka School project was founded to break the cycle of violence through an innovative education program that literally removed young boys from low-performing public schools and unstable home environments. The Boys of Baraka follows four boys as they travel with their classmates to rural Kenya in East Africa, where a teacher-student ratio of one to five, a strict disciplinary program and a comprehensive curriculum form the core of an extraordinary new journey in their transformation to men.

PBS Airdate: February 6, 2007
Go to the companion Web site
NARRATOR: 1939: A chemist at a midwestern paint company makes
a startling discovery, one that could improve the health of millions of people.
The company wants him to stick to making paint, but this man has always gone
his own way. He was the grandson of Alabama slaves, yet he went on to become
one of America's great scientists.
HELEN PRINTY (Julian Laboratories Chemist): He had to fight to
overcome the odds of being a black man in America.
JOHN KENLY SMITH (Historian): The chemical world was a club, and
outsiders were not really all that welcome.
PETER WALTON (Julian Laboratories Employee): We lived, for the
most part, in a highly stressed, very competitive environment.
NARRATOR: Outside the laboratory, he faced challenges of a
different kind.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Once the violence began, Anna and I
felt we had no choice but to stay.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: My dad was angry when he came home, and clearly ready
to fight.
PERCY JULIAN(Dramatization): For more than a century we have
watched the denial of elemental liberty to millions of black people in our
southland. NARRATOR:	He found freedom in the laboratory. His science helped
unlock the secret chemistry of plants, a discovery that would help relieve one
of the most crippling human diseases and plunge him into one of the fiercest
battles in the history of science.
GREGORY PETSKO (Chemist): This is one of the towering figures of
chemistry in 20th century and one of the great African American scientists of
all time.
NARRATOR: A brilliant chemist, a volatile personality, a man
whose devotion to science would not be denied.
WILLIE PEARSON (Sociologist): This man was "Exhibit A" of
determination and never giving up.
V/O (Dramatization of Senate Hearings): Please state your full
name for the record.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): My name is Percy Julian. NARRATOR: Every spring, in Oak Park, Illinois, people from all
over the village would go out of their way to see the explosion of color at the
home on the corner of East and Chicago Avenues. PERCY JULIAN, JR.: The tulips just went on forever. My dad, he'd be out
there in his black beret, and my sense was that he had this love affair with
growing things.
NARRATOR: What many passersby didn't realize was that the
tulip grower was also one of America's great scientists.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Well, ladies and gentleman,
essentially, I'm going to talk to you about three plants, three marvelous
plants, three marvelous plants that make the words of the Psalmist come true
and ring true again, "Consider the lilies of the field: they toil not, neither
do they spin, and yet Solomon in all his glory was never arrayed like one of
these."
NARRATOR: It was not simply the beauty of plants that
captivated Percy Julian, but their ability to produce an endless variety of
powerful chemicals. In the 1930s, Julian set out to tap what he called the
"natural laboratories" of plants, to make a new class of drugs that would help
millions of people.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Spoiled? What do you mean
spoiled?
NARRATOR: Julian fought through extraordinary obstacles to
make a place for himself in a profession and a country divided by race.
JAMES ANDERSON (Historian): The message from white society is
very clear: it is not your achievement or your merit or your accomplishments
that matter, it's the color of your skin, and because of that you're
rejected.
GREGORY PETSKO: Yet over and over again, he doesn't let this stop him.
He presses on, sure that his vision of where he wants to go and how he wants to
get there is right.
JAMES SHOFFNER (Chemist): After Percy Julian, nobody could say
anymore that blacks couldn't do science, because he was at the very top of his
profession.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): The story I will tell you tonight
is a story of wonder and amazement, almost a story of miracles. It is a story
of laughter and tears. It is a story of human beings, therefore, a story of
meanness, of stupidity, of kindness and nobility.
One beautiful morning, when I was 12 years old, I went berry-picking on my
grandfather's farm in Alabama. I shall never forget how beautiful life seemed
to me that morning, under the spell of an Alabama forest. But in the midst of
that beauty, I came across a Negro body hanging from a tree. He had been
lynched a few hours earlier. He didn't look like a criminal; he just looked
like a scared boy.
On the way back, I encountered and killed a rattlesnake. For years afterward,
every time I saw a white man, I involuntarily saw the contours of a rattlesnake
head on his face. Many years later, a reporter asked me what were my greatest
nightmares from my childhood in the South. I told him, "White folks and
rattlesnakes."
NARRATOR: Percy Lavon Julian was born in Montgomery, Alabama,
in 1899, at a time when southerners lived under a system of forced segregation
called Jim Crow. JAMES ANDERSON: I think the greatest consequence of Jim Crow is fear.
You knew if you said the wrong thing or went in the wrong door or drank out of
the wrong water fountain...that any of those things could lead to your
death.
NARRATOR: To shelter his children from this oppressive
atmosphere, Julian's father turned to the world of ideas.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Every penny my father could scrape
together went into building a wonderful library for his children, for the
public library was closed to us. My father created, in my imagination, brave
new worlds to conquer.
NARRATOR: As a young man, James Julian had been a
schoolteacher. His wife Elizabeth was a teacher, too. They believed education
offered the path to a better life for black people.
Denied his own chance to go to college, James made it his mission to send
his children instead, but it would not be easy. In Montgomery, and across most
of the South, public schools for black children simply stopped after the eighth
grade.
JAMES ANDERSON: The message from white society, to black students, was
that you should have just enough education to be good field hands and good
laborers, cooks and maids and so forth.
NARRATOR: With no high school to attend, Percy Julian
completed two years at the local teacher training school for Negroes. In 1916,
with barely a 10th grade education, Percy Julian became the first member of his
family to live out his father's dream.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): During the hectic week of
preparations, my father had taken me aside for a long talk. "This is the
greatest moment of your life," he told me. "But it is also a great
responsibility, for you are now beginning to create a family, a family of
educated people."
There they were, three generations of hope and prayer, waving to a fourth
generation that was going off to college! And why? Because they had the simple
faith that the last great hope of the Earth is education for all the people.
NARRATOR: Julian's destination was DePauw University, a small
liberal arts college in Greencastle, Indiana. DePauw had accepted a few black
students since the Civil War, but expected them to know their place.
JAMES ANDERSON: A black student entering a white university, if they
didn't know before they arrived, they found out, pretty quickly, that they were
not welcome in the university or in the community.
NARRATOR: Instead of being assigned to a dorm like his white
classmates, Julian was shown to an off-campus room with a slop jar for a
toilet.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I soon got up enough courage to ask
Mrs. Townsend what time we would have dinner, but she tersely informed me that
she was not expected to give me my meals.
NARRATOR: Julian wandered the streets of Greencastle for a day
and a half before finding a diner that would serve a Negro.
He would continue to take his meals off-campus until he learned of an
opening at the Sigma Chi fraternity. In exchange for waiting on his housemates
and firing their furnace, Julian could have a room in the basement. He soon
felt at ease in the fraternity; the classroom was a different matter. JAMES ANDERSON: You sit in a classroom with kids who have read things
that you never heard of, they've taken math courses that you haven't taken, and
so one of the academic challenges is trying to hold on until you can catch
up.
NARRATOR: For two years Julian would take remedial classes at
a local high school in addition to his normal course load.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I remember writing to my father, "I
know you and Mother have always known what was best for me, but I think you
made a mistake by sending me to compete with these white students. They are so
brilliant that I am always hopelessly behind."
NARRATOR: But by his sophomore year, Julian was gaining fast
on his white classmates, thanks, in part, to the encouragement of chemistry
professor William Blanchard. Blanchard had what one student called "a
contagious enthusiasm for discovering the unknown." Under his tutelage, Julian
began to dream of a career as a research chemist.
Only one African American had ever earned a doctorate in chemistry. His
name was St. Elmo Brady. Julian decided that if Brady could do it, so could he.
After four years, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and first in his class.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): At commencement time, my
great-grandmother bared her shoulders, and she showed me, for the first time,
the deep scars that had remained from a beating she had received when, one day,
during the waning days of the Civil War, she went through the Negro quarters
and cried out, "Get yourselves ready, children. The Yankees are coming. The
Lord has heard our prayers!" And then, proudly, she took my Phi Beta Kappa key in her hand and said, "This
is worth all the scars."
NARRATOR: Encouraged by Percy's success, his father moved the
whole family north to Greencastle to send the rest of the children to DePauw.
Eventually, Julian's two brothers would become doctors, and his three sisters
would earn master's degrees.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I shall never forget an anxious
week of waiting, in 1920, to see if I would get into graduate school. I stood
by as, day by day, my fellow students in chemistry said, "I am going to
Illinois," "I'm going to Ohio State," or "I'm going to Michigan." "Where are
you going?" they asked. And they answered for me: "You must be waiting for the
Harvard plum!"
I could stand the suspense no longer. I went to Professor Blanchard. And there
he showed me numerous letters from men who had really meant "god" to me, great
American chemists of their day. "Discourage your bright colored lad," they
wrote. "We couldn't get him a job when he's done, and it'll only mean
frustration. Why don't you find him a teaching job in a Negro college in the
South? He doesn't need a Ph.D. for that."
JAMES ANDERSON: What happened to Julian was something that would have
been common throughout the land. To have a good college education was way
beyond anything that one would expect for an African American. And so there's
the sense that he'd had enough. "Stop here. Be content with this. Go back and
teach your people."
NARRATOR: In 1920, Julian reluctantly returned to the south to
teach, but he clung to the dream of earning his Ph.D. At 21, he was embarking
on a quest that would last more than 10 years. His first stop was Fisk University in Nashville, one of the best Negro
colleges in the country. His idol, St. Elmo Brady, had studied at Fisk. But
Julian chafed at the limitations of the black college system: overcrowded
classrooms, inadequate libraries and poorly equipped laboratories.
After two years, he was on the move again. Julian had won a scholarship to
study chemistry at one of America's most famous universities.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): No Negro has yet obtained his
master's degree in chemistry at Harvard, and so I'm up against a hard situation
again.
JAMES ANDERSON: When Julian arrived at Harvard, in 1922, the racial
climate was probably worse than it had been at any point in the 20th
century.
NARRATOR: President Abbott Lawrence Lowell had set the tone by
banning black students from the dorms in Harvard Yard.
Julian sailed through his first year and earned his master's degree in the
spring of 1923. He continued his studies for three more years but left Harvard without his
doctorate. Years later, he would bitterly tell friends he had been denied the
teaching assistantship he needed to stay in school.
JAMES ANDERSON: If you were going to be a teaching assistant and teach
white students, that was a no-no. That's just hardly acceptable at that time
and that place. If you were denied that, you were also denied the opportunity
to finance your education. NARRATOR: Julian spent an unhappy year teaching at a small
black college near Charleston, West Virginia. Then his fortunes turned. He was
invited to join the faculty at the nation's most distinguished black
university: Howard University, in Washington, D.C.
He was replacing St. Elmo Brady, who was returning to Fisk. Julian went
straight to work, designing a new chemistry building and honing a distinctive
lecture style.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I should warn you that scientists
are traditionally poor speakers, because they have a hard time letting go of
their gobbledy-gook. "Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home," becomes impossible
when you must call the ladybird "coccinella bipunctata." NARRATOR: Despite his growing stature at Howard, Julian was
still determined to earn his Ph.D. In 1929, he finally got his chance. He won a
fellowship that allowed him to take a leave from Howard to study at the
University of Vienna, in Austria. He was about to begin a lifelong inquiry into
the chemistry of plants.
GREGORY PETSKO: For thousands of years, long before there was such a
thing as a science of chemistry, people were fascinated by plants, because they
knew that plants contained substances that could affect people. Coffee will
keep you awake. Tobacco contains something that will calm your nerves. Foxglove
contains an extract that'll affect your heart. And the whole goal of chemistry
in the early part of the 20th century was to understand what these natural
products were, to characterize their chemical structures, and figure out how to
make them. This was called "natural products chemistry." It was the main branch
of chemistry. And in 1929, Vienna, in Austria, was the seat of natural products
chemistry. And that's why Percy Julian went there. NARRATOR: Julian arrived at Vienna's Chemische Institut with
huge crates of ground glassware, items the Viennese students had heard about
but never seen. BERNHARD WITKOP (National Academy of Sciences Member): The
unpacking became a big ceremony surrounded by fellow students, who "oohed" and
"aahed" about the wonders that came out of these crates.
NARRATOR: Among the onlookers was Josef Pikl, a chemist who
would become one of Julian's closest friends and collaborators. They had come
to Vienna to study under the renowned scientist Ernst Späth. Späth
was a giant in the field of natural products chemistry. He had a particular
interest in a family of compounds called alkaloids.
GREGORY PETSKO: Of all the natural products, the ones that fascinated
people the most were the alkaloids, because they seemed the most powerful. A
thimbleful of some alkaloids would bring down an elephant. NARRATOR: It's believed that many alkaloids evolved to protect
plants from organisms that might eat or harm them, but these same compounds can
have unexpected effects on people.
GREGORY PETSKO: We now know, for example, that it's an alkaloid,
caffeine, that's responsible for the stimulant effect of coffee beans. We also
know that it's an alkaloid called nicotine that's the calming influence in
tobacco plants. Other alkaloids are things like morphine, strychnine, cocaine.
A whole host of things that we now know are drugs turn out to be plant
alkaloids.
NARRATOR: By 1929, it was known that an alkaloid from the root
of a common Austrian shrub called Corydalis cava was effective in treating pain
and heart palpitations. Späth asked Julian to find out why.
DAGMAR RINGE (Chemist): And so the question was which compound,
which precise compound in this tuber, is responsible for the biological effect
that one is seeing?
NARRATOR: Isolate the active ingredient in Corydalis cava, and
then identify its chemical structure: this was the challenge Julian would have
to meet to earn his Ph.D. Free, at last, of teaching and administrative duties, he threw himself into
his research as never before.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): For the first time in my life, I
represent a creating, alive and wide-awake chemist. I recognize that
publications and research will be, for me, as natural a thing as going to bed
and eating a meal. Truly, I was the luckiest guy in all the world to land here.
NARRATOR: Just outside the laboratory was a vibrant world that
Julian was eager to explore. A fellow student, Edwin Mosettig, took the
American under his wing. Soon Julian was joining the Mosettig family for ski
trips, swims in the Danube and the opera. BERNHARD WITKOP: The mother of Edwin Mosettig was a famous musician, and
the Mosettig house was a center for social activity. So, in that way, Percy got
access to layers of the society that were inaccessible in America. Black
persons in Europe were very rare, and Percy, for the first time in his life,
fully unfolded, because he was admired there. NARRATOR: For Julian, the sense of freedom was exhilarating.
In letter after letter, he described his busy social life to colleagues back at
Howard.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And now a little news: I have the
prettiest girl in Vienna. You have never gazed on such beauty. Monday night, we
were in the opera and heard Beethoven's Fidelio.
Nature makes its demands, so I've made a date with my little German
sweetheart. They didn't lie when they talked of beautiful Viennese women.
Afterwards, we went to the sweetest wine cellar you ever saw and drank 'til 3
a.m.
NARRATOR: But at 7:55 each morning, Julian was back in the
laboratory, working under the watchful eye of a man so severe he would
immediately fail a student he considered lazy or untalented.
The pressure was mounting on Julian to isolate the elusive alkaloids on
which his dissertation depended.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): The last two months, I have passed
through a hellish siege of work. Reaction upon reaction, and yet I stand at the
door and knock, as it were. I don't know a damned thing. NARRATOR: The alkaloids that puzzled Julian, like most of the
molecules of life, are made, primarily, of carbon. GREGORY ROBINSON (Chemist): Carbon is really the Super Glue of
the chemical world, in the sense that carbon can bond to itself in almost an
infinite number of ways.
DAGMAR RINGE:	In this model, for instance, I can make a chain of carbons
that continues, practically, infinitely. However, it can also come together
into a ring structure, in this case a six-carbon ring structure. NARRATOR: The carbon ring is one of nature's fundamental
building blocks, found in an endless variety of compounds. Members of the
alkaloid family all have one or more nitrogen atoms. But otherwise their
structures vary widely, which presented Julian with a formidable
challenge.
NED HEINDEL (Chemist): He was working in some very difficult
chemistry. When you don't know anything about what the structure is of the
material you're isolating, you have to tear your molecule apart, atom by atom,
and try to deduce the structure. DAGMAR RINGE:	It's like finding a needle in a haystack. It requires
stubbornness. It requires focus. It requires repeating, over and over, the same
kinds of processes, until the answers come out.
NARRATOR: Slowly the answers did come. In his second year,
Julian finally identified the active alkaloid in Corydalis cava, his first
chemical triumph. This work with Späth would be the foundation of his
future career.
BERNHARD WITKOP: When Ernst Späth was asked about his student,
Percy Julian, he characterized him and said, "Ein ausserordentlicher Student
wie ich in meiner Laufbahn noch nie gehabt habe," "an extraordinary student,
the likes of which I have never had before in my career as a teacher."
NARRATOR: Julian returned to America, in the fall of 1931,
with the doctorate he had pursued for more than a decade. The years in Vienna
had dramatically increased his self-confidence. But they had also sown the
seeds of a personal catastrophe that awaited him at Howard.
Back in Washington, Julian set out to turn Howard into a center for true
chemical research, something his predecessor had been unable to do. Burdened
with teaching responsibilities, St. Elmo Brady had not published a single
research paper in the 15 years since earning his Ph.D. Julian was determined
this would not happen to him.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I am going to give every damned
ounce of my energy towards plans to flood the chemical market with as much
research as the day's hours and my strength will allow.
NARRATOR: He brought Josef Pikl over from Vienna, and the two
went straight to work on a series of papers.
When their first was accepted for publication, Julian proudly noted it was
the first with a black chemist as senior author. Percy Julian was now America's
preeminent black chemist and, at Howard, one of President Mordecai Johnson's
rising stars.
But Johnson had made many enemies in his five years at Howard. Soon Julian
would be caught up in university politics, with disastrous results. The trouble
began when Julian, at the president's request, goaded a white chemist named
Jacob Shohan into resigning. Shohan retaliated by releasing to the local black
press the letters Julian had written to him from Vienna.
Julian's accounts of his romances, his criticism of faculty members,
suddenly it was all public, ammunition to be used against Julian and Johnson by
the president's enemies.
Just as Julian's letters began to appear in the press, there was another
bombshell. His laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson, charged he had found his
wife and Julian together. Lawsuits flew between Julian and Thompson. When
Thompson was fired for going public with his charges, he released the letters
that Julian had written to him from Vienna.
Through the summer of 1932, the Baltimore Afro-American published
letter after letter from the man the newspaper dubbed "Howard's Prize
Letter-Writer." Finally, under pressure from Johnson and the Board of Trustees, Julian
resigned. It was the middle of the Great Depression. Julian was a chemist
without a laboratory, a black man without a job. Only a year after his
triumphant return from Vienna, the career he'd worked so hard to build was in
ruins.
When all seemed lost, Julian's mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a
lifeline, bringing him back to DePauw as a research fellow to supervise lab
sections. It was a big step down from full professor and department chairman,
but he had a lab again, and his research partner, Josef Pikl, would join him at
DePauw.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): In much of my life I've had to pick
up the broken fragments of chance and turn them into opportunity. NARRATOR: Over the next three years, 11 of the student
projects Julian supervised would lead to papers in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society.
NED HEINDEL:	Eleven undergraduate papers published in JACS, out
of a student body of that size, was not only unusual for the 1930s, it would be
unusual now. Julian took the talent in those students and put that institution
on the map for undergraduate research. NARRATOR: DePauw's newest instructor left a powerful
impression on undergraduate Ray Dawson.
RAY DAWSON (DePauw Alumnus): He put on a grand show. He would
come into his lectures, in his white lab jacket, with a flourish. He was
oratorical in a way some great scientist from London or Berlin might be. It was
just a show, but a very good one. NARRATOR: Julian had finally found fulfillment, a place where
he could teach and research. But when the local American Legion assailed the
school for hiring a Negro who had been dismissed from Howard University, Julian
was forced to stop teaching. He could stay on as long as his research grant
lasted, but his days at DePauw were numbered. Everything he'd work for was
about to collapse again. PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I decided I had to do things that
would make people take more notice of me. NARRATOR: What he did was take on a high-stakes research
project, one that would either make him or break him.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): It all began with a simple little
bean, the Calabar bean. It was a beautiful, purple bean when I first got it.
But it is not only beautiful in its appearance, but also in the laboratory it
has within it.
NARRATOR: Chemists had been fascinated by the Calabar bean
ever since British missionaries brought it back from Africa in the mid-1800s.
From the bean, they had isolated an alkaloid called physostigmine—used to
treat glaucoma—but no one had been able to synthesize the complex
molecule. GREGORY PETSKO: Synthesis is the process of making a natural product, or
some other substance, artificially, in the lab, one step at a time, from
extremely simple building blocks.
NARRATOR: Synthesis was the highest calling for a chemist in
the 1930s. A successful synthesis could bring great medical benefits, by making
a scarce natural product more widely available. Just as important, it proved
beyond a doubt that the chemist understood how the molecule was put
together.
NED HEINDEL:	There were very few alkaloids that had been made from
scratch in Julian's time. The synthesis of physostigmine would bring
recognition to whoever achieved it. And that's what Percy Julian set out to
do.
NARRATOR: But Julian was not alone. At Oxford University,
another chemist was at work on his own synthesis. His name was Robert
Robinson.
NED HEINDEL:	Sir Robert Robinson was sort of the dean of organic
chemists in England. He was a much-respected creator of molecules, a trainer of
many Ph.D. students. He was the premier organic chemist of his time. NARRATOR: Moving step-by-step toward a final synthesis,
Robinson had already published nine papers on physostigmine in Britain's
leading chemical journal.
NED HEINDEL:	It's a little bit of intimidation. The world is supposed to
know, "I've got this domain; you stay out of it."
NARRATOR: But to Julian, Robinson's approach seemed clumsy.
Convinced there was a simpler way, he set out to beat the Englishman to the
synthesis. A high-profile scientific victory would be just the thing to get his
career back on track, but it wouldn't be easy. Physostigmine was unlike any
molecule that had been synthesized before.
NED HEINDEL:	It bristled with spots around the molecule where methyl
groups were hanging, that's a carbon with three hydrogens. There are actually
four of these, and getting them in the right place is essential to making
nature's molecule. It was a formidable chemical challenge for anybody to tackle
in the early 1930s.
NARRATOR: Julian tackled it the way all chemists do: one step
at a time.
GREGORY PETSKO: When you synthesize a molecule, you start with very
small substances, substances you can buy or that you know how to make already.
You then start assembling those into fragments of the thing that you're hoping
to make in the end; they're called "intermediates." And what you're doing is
you're following a particular path. This path takes you from the simple
starting substances all the way to the final product, the natural product.
NARRATOR: To build his molecule, Julian drew on a battery of
techniques for manipulating atoms.
NED HEINDEL:	One can heat something to a very high temperature; that
usually gets the atoms vibrating and makes new bonds possible. You can oxidize
something—you can add oxygen to it. You can take oxygen out of a
molecule; that's a reduction. We can expose it to pressure. Sometimes, we can
expose it to light, to cajole the atoms to do what we want.
NARRATOR: At each step, Julian had to verify that he'd
actually made the compounds he intended to. For this, he relied on a device
called a combustion train.
NED HEINDEL:	This technique takes an organic molecule which contains
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and burns it.
NARRATOR: By weighing the resulting gases, Julian could tell
what atoms were present and in what ratio.
GREGORY PETSKO: How much carbon does it have? How much hydrogen does it
have? How much nitrogen does it have? If your compound has the right ratio,
you're a long way towards being sure you've made what you thought you made.
NED HEINDEL:	And then you repeat this process of purification and of
analysis for each intermediate, until you finally get to the natural
product.
NARRATOR: Julian was under tremendous pressure to complete the
research, pressure compounded by events in his personal life. He was engaged.
His fiancée was the woman who'd been at the center of the Howard
scandal, the former wife of his laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson. Born Anna Roselle Johnson, she was a member of a prominent African American
family from Baltimore. She had graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was now working
toward a Ph.D. in sociology.
RAY DAWSON:	They'd already set, I believe, two wedding dates, which he
had canceled, and she told him that this was the last time. Unless he kept the
new latest date, she would break off their engagement. And he was quite upset
by this, but he had no choice but to proceed, because we were only a few weeks
away from the end. NARRATOR: In 1934, Julian and Pikl sent off their first paper
on physostigmine, outlining a new approach to the synthesis. Julian attacked
Robinson in the beginning lines of the paper.
NED HEINDEL:	To have a young upstart taking on the pope of organic
chemistry in England, naming him, and coupling the words "failure" and
"embarrassing" and "low yield" is almost unbelievably aggressive.
GREGORY ROBINSON: In many regards, that was a pivotal point in Julian's
career. If he were wrong, he could effectively, almost, write off any research
career at that point.
NARRATOR: Working around the clock, Julian and Pikl
synthesized a compound that was one step removed from physostigmine. Since that
last step was already known, this would count as a complete synthesis. But
before they could publish, Robinson struck again with his own synthesis of the
same compound. The race was over.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): The shock was almost unbearable. We
were not the first, just the "me toos." Why did he, of so much fame, who didn't
at all need the glory, have to snatch the prize from us?
Suddenly, my eye caught something. "Look, Josef, he's made a big blunder." Our
crystals melted at about 39° Celsius, body temperature. Indeed, we were
able to melt them by closing them in our armpits. His compound melted not at
body temperature, but almost 50 degrees higher. "He hasn't got it!" I cried.
NED HEINDEL:	The melting point of a molecule is a fingerprint. If
Julian's melting point is correct then Robinson's can't be, and these can't be
the same substance. And Julian quickly grasps on that and says, "You've got the
wrong compound."
NARRATOR: Julian hurriedly wrote an addendum to their next
paper.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): "We believe that the English
authors are in error." Josef was a very unhappy man. "If we are wrong, we are
irretrievably ruined," he said.
It hit like a bombshell. Telegrams came in from all over the world. My old
professor, Kohler of Harvard, he wrote: "I pray that you are right. If not, the
future may be dark for you."
NED HEINDEL:	Part of what he's just done here is a go-for-broke plan.
He's working as an underpaid assistant in a liberal arts college. He
desperately needs a break.
NARRATOR: Now the pressure was on Julian and Pikl to prove
they were right.
RAY DAWSON:	Percy was a bundle of nerves, but, yet, he had this
underlying drive that didn't permit him to stop, to run away, to give up.
NARRATOR: To confirm his synthesis, Julian needed to take one
final melting point.
DAGMAR RINGE:	When chemists took a melting point, they would put some
crystals into a capillary tube, strap that capillary tube to a thermometer, and
then place the complete assembly into an oil bath. They're looking to determine
the exact moment when the crystals begin to melt.
NARRATOR: To claim victory over Robinson, Julian had to show
that another set of crystals from his synthesis melted at the same temperature
as their natural counterpart, 135 degrees.
NED HEINDEL:	This has got to be the ultimate high. "I've taken on the
master, and I've beaten him."
NARRATOR: The physostigmine papers were immediately recognized
as a milestone in American chemical history, an early example of what chemists
call "total synthesis," the complete assembly of a complex molecule from basic
chemical building blocks. NED HEINDEL:	Julian's pathway to physostigmine is so simple that it can
be summarized in essentially two publications. Chemists look at them and marvel
at..."How did he do that in so elegant of a sequence?"
JAMES SHOFFNER: To call a process "elegant" means that the synthesis is
achieved in the minimal amount of steps necessary in order to bring about a
product. And so that's really to give it the highest accolade that you can
give, that it is elegant.
NARRATOR: In 1935, Percy finally married Anna in a private
ceremony on Christmas Eve. As his bride went back east to finish her doctorate,
Julian looked forward to new career opportunities his triumph would
bring.
On the strength of the physostigmine work, William Blanchard had
recommended his protégé for a permanent faculty position at
DePauw.
DONALD "JACK" COOK (Former DePauw Chemistry Chairman): If DePauw
had recognized Percy's capabilities and put him on the staff at that time, it
would have been a historical event. It didn't happen.
NARRATOR: Julian applied to other universities, with the same
result.
JAMES ANDERSON: Most institutions would not even tolerate, for a second,
having an African American in the role of a teacher or a faculty.
WILLIE PEARSON: This was during a time of rampant scientific racism.
There were a number of scholars at Harvard and other institutions that were
doing scientific studies and reporting that African Americans did not have the
capacity to do science, because they were actually an inferior race. NARRATOR: In early 1936, Julian's research grant ran out. Now,
with no hope of an academic career, he turned his attention to industry. America's leading chemical corporation, DuPont, had invited Julian and Pikl
for an interview. DuPont executives offered Pikl a job. To Julian, he later
recalled, they offered an apology: "We didn't know you were a Negro."
JOHN KENLY SMITH: The world of chemical research and development in
industry, in this period, was overwhelmingly white Anglo-Saxon Protestant men,
and outsiders were not really all that welcome.
NARRATOR: At Julian's insistence, Pikl took the job at DuPont
and spent the rest of his career there. Julian returned to the job hunt.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Day by day, as I entered these
firms, presented my credentials and asked for a job, the answer almost seemed
like it had been transmitted by wire from one firm to the other. It ran like
this: "We've never hired a Negro research chemist before. We don't know how it
would work out."
NARRATOR: Finally, Julian caught a break. The Institute of
Paper Chemistry, in Appleton, Wisconsin, was prepared to make him an
offer.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And then they were informed by city
attorneys that an old Appleton statute forbade Negroes from being housed in
Appleton overnight. This, in the Year of our Lord, 1936! But in that meeting, sat a board member, an Irishman named William J.
O'Brien.
NARRATOR: O'Brien was vice president of the Glidden Company.
He'd been looking for a sharp chemist to run the company's new Chicago
laboratory. He offered Julian the job of Director of Research.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I had already wired Anna, several
times, that I had landed jobs, so this time I was a little more cautious: "Am
considering offer Glidden Company in research at $5,000." Her reply came back:
"What do you mean `considering?'"
JOHN KENLY SMITH: The fact that Percy Julian was hired to be the
director of a laboratory, not just a member of a laboratory, is truly
remarkable and unprecedented.
JAMES SHOFFNER: That was 10 years before Jackie Robinson. You know? And
we look toward the Jackie Robinson example as being pivotal in opening up not
just baseball, but a whole lot of other opportunities for black people.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And so I came to Chicago and
started in on another fascinating plant, the soybean.
NARRATOR: Neither Julian, nor anyone else in 1936, had any
idea what a powerhouse the soybean would become.
Today the soybean is one of the pillars of American agriculture, second
only to corn among the major crops. Seventy million acres of farmland are
planted in soy, with an annual harvest worth more than $20 billion. Soy is used
in a wide range of products, from food and medicine to paper and
plastics.
TODD ALLEN (Soybean Farmer): It's a very widely used commodity.
If you go down to the grocery store and look at the label, you'll find soybean
oil in there somewhere.
Soybeans originally came into this country from China, as a hay crop for
grazing, for beef cattle. But, also, it manufactures its own nitrogen, and back
in the 1920s, well, then everybody needed that, because we didn't have a lot of
commercial fertilizer back then.
But then, as our machinery developed, we learned that we could cut and process
these soy beans and break them down into feed for our animals and soy oil for
human consumption.
NARRATOR: But soybeans really took off in the 1930s, when
industry discovered the plant, thanks, in part, to the efforts of an unlikely
champion: automaker Henry Ford. Ford planted thousands of acres of soybeans,
and alongside his Dearborn auto plant, he built a soybean laboratory and
processing factory.
JOHN KENLY SMITH: Ford sets up a laboratory in the early 1930s, hires a
young, self-trained chemist to run the laboratory, and they begin doing lots of
experiments trying to figure how you could use soybeans in making cars.
NARRATOR: Out of his lab came new soybean-based auto paints,
lubricating oils and soybean-based plastics that Ford turned into steering
wheels, gearshift knobs and dent-proof fenders.
V/O (Film Clip): Industrial chemists are working to find new uses
for soybean oil and soybean meal.
NARRATOR:	Soon other industrialists were following Ford's lead,
building soybean processing plants across the Midwest.
One of the first to embrace the "miracle bean" was Percy Julian's new boss,
Adrian Joyce of the Glidden Company. Under Joyce, Glidden had grown from a
single paint store in Cleveland into one of the nation's leading paint
manufacturers.
JOHN KENLY SMITH: But Joyce didn't stop there. He diversified into a
wide range of products. Durkee Famous Foods was a Glidden brand. He also moved
into soybean processing.
NARRATOR: Convinced the soybean would be critical to Glidden's
future, Joyce set up a new Soya Products Division in Chicago. The first
assignment for his new research director: isolate the protein of the soybean,
something that had never been done on an industrial scale.
Julian plunged into his new job, keenly aware that people were watching to
see how this black chemist would measure up. PETER WALTON: The people in the plant were always mindful of a white
laboratory coat, a blur that might swoop down at any moment.
HELEN PRINTY:	He would pester you at many times. He would keep, you
know, wanting to know what was new, every half an hour, almost.
RISHER WATTS (Julian Laboratories Chemist): And he expected you
to tell him something different every time he came in there, something that was
favorable.
NARRATOR: But for more than a year, the news was not
favorable.
RISHER WATTS:	In chemistry, things don't ever go the way you plan it,
because you've got reactions that are very critical; even a little variation in
temperature, in concentration and time, and everything will give you a bad
outcome.
NARRATOR: Eventually, Julian's chemists found just the right
combination of time, temperature and acidity to pull the protein out of the
soybean. Julian's "Alpha protein" was the first vegetable protein produced in
bulk anywhere in America. It made millions for Glidden as a new industrial
paper coating.
Later it would be a key ingredient in one of the first water-based, or
"latex" house paints, Glidden's Spred Satin. V/O (Paint Commercial): Get new Spred house paint.
NARRATOR: After Alpha protein, Adrian Joyce urged Julian to
turn his attention to other parts of the soybean.
JOHN KENLY SMITH: Joyce was always trying to figure out every possible
use for everything you have. Find out, "is there some chemical in here that we
otherwise might be throwing down the drain, that we might be able to make money
out of?"
NARRATOR: Julian drove his staff to turn the soybean inside
out.
ARNOLD HIRSCH (Julian Laboratories Chemist): Julian wanted
everyone to perform to the best of their ability, and he did everything in his
power to motivate people to do that.
JAMES LETTON (Julian Laboratories Production Manager): I always
thought he was a master psychologist. I think he was very much aware of what he
was doing and who he was doing it to.
RISHER WATTS:	His purpose was to get the best out of you. I think that's
what it was all about.
NARRATOR: The chemistry invented by Julian and his team led to
scores of new products. From soybean oil came lecithin, to make chocolate
smoother, new salad oils and shortenings for Durkee, and a new non-spattering
margarine.
HELEN PRINTY:	Always when you were working on one thing, there was
another thing coming up. You were always thinking ahead of time, what was the
next big thing?
NARRATOR: From soybean meal came plastics, linoleum, plywood
glue, high-protein livestock feed and dog food.
HELEN PRINTY:	He was brilliant. He would set out a research project, and
he would write the introduction and the description of the work, and a
conclusion. He did everything except do the experiment.
GENE WOROCH (Glidden Chemist): And there would be a statement,
something to the effect that, "The problem is solved; all that remains to be
done is..." And many of us used to cringe at this, because it would be our
responsibility to get this to work, and sometimes it didn't work.
RISHER WATTS:	He was very demanding. And that was on a daily basis, I
mean, because he had his hands on everything that went on.
V/O (Film Clip): Yes, there's magic in this Cinderella crop, and
we've hardly scratched the surface.
NARRATOR: The stream of products coming out of Julian's lab
joined the flood of household and industrial goods from Dow, DuPont and other
companies whose chemistry was changing the way Americans lived.
V/O (Film Clip): ...nylon stockings, introduced in 1938. There's
barely a minute of your time on Earth that is not in some way made secure and
comfortable through chemistry.
JOHN KENLY SMITH: There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for
chemicals in the 1930s.
V/O (Film Clip): Here are the headquarters of a group of
super-sleuths, engaged in solving some of the major mysteries of the universe.
They take molecules apart and put them together again, in a different form, to
make new and incredible things.
NARRATOR: People saw the industry as sort of the leading edge
of high technology, of providing goods and services that were going to make
people's lives better and to keep the economy growing.
V/O (Film Clip): The nation's industrial skyline parted in the
middle, to make room for the growing chemical industry.
NARRATOR: Glidden's new soybean division was a success.
Julian's reward was a raise that allowed him to be reunited with Anna. For the
first three years of their marriage, she had been back east, earning her Ph.D.
and working in the Washington public schools. Now she joined Percy in Chicago,
at last.
As the couple settled into their new home, in the Westside community of
Maywood, Anna learned just how driven her husband could be when it came to
chemistry.
"Science can be a hard taskmaster," she would remember. "Dinner can be at
seven or 11, as far as the true disciple of chemistry is concerned."
Glidden was delighted with Julian's chemistry, but Julian was becoming
restless.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I was itching to get away from dog
foods, paint and oleomargarine, and to tackle nature again with more exacting
methods.
HELEN PRINTY:	Doctor Julian loved chemistry. He used to take the people
that were working on the products for the Glidden Company and sneak us off and
do other things that he was interested in, on the side.
NARRATOR: Julian was especially interested in a compound
called progesterone.
V/O (Medical Film Clip): New ways of controlling fertility have
begun to suggest...
NARRATOR:	Discovered in 1934, progesterone was called the
"pregnancy hormone," because it plays a central role in preparing a woman's
uterus for childbirth.
HELEN PRINTY:	Apparently, Mrs. Julian had had a couple of miscarriages.
And doctors at that time had found that progesterone was essential to carrying
a child to term.
WOMAN IN LABOR (Medical Film Clip): The pains are getting
harder.
NARRATOR: In the 1930s, nearly one out every six pregnancies
in America ended in miscarriage or premature birth. DOCTOR (Medial Film Clip): Relax, your baby is almost here
now.
NARRATOR: Hundreds of thousands of babies were lost each year.
Julian realized that progesterone offered new hope. He and other chemists began
looking for ways to make the hormone for pregnant women at risk. Progesterone is one of a class of compounds called steroids, which
scientists were just beginning to realize played many key roles in the
body.
GREGORY PETSKO: They were involved in reproduction. They were involved
in sexual development. They were involved in the response to injury and growth.
And yet despite this enormous range of different physiological effects, these
compounds all seemed to have similar chemical structures.
DAGMAR RINGE:	The group of molecules that we call steroids all share a
common framework, composed of these four-ring systems right here: a
six-membered ring, fused to a second six-membered ring, fused to a third
six-membered ring, fused to a five-membered ring.
NARRATOR: Dozens of steroid molecules are made by the body,
ranging from cholesterol to digestive fluids to sex hormones, such as
progesterone and testosterone. The anabolic steroids used by some athletes
today are simply modified forms of the natural male hormone.
NED HEINDEL:	Once it was recognized that the family of materials we call
steroids had such an impact on human health, there became a global push: "Can
we get these materials? Can we make them available?" And, "What sources do they
come from?
NARRATOR: Chemists first tried isolating steroids from animal
extracts like horse urine, but the process required vast amounts of raw
material and yielded only tiny amounts of steroids.
GREGORY PETSKO: The breakthrough, in making steroids available, was the
realization that you could take substances from plants that could form the
starting point for the synthesis of steroids. That would give you a leg up on
the process. NARRATOR: In the mid-1930s, scientists had discovered that
plants have steroids too, with the same four carbon rings found in animal
steroids.
DAGMAR RINGE:	It was only a very small leap to realize that one could
convert a plant steroid into an animal steroid.
NARRATOR: The idea that plants made chemicals similar to human
steroids was something Julian already knew. Back at DePauw, while researching
physostigmine, Julian had set aside a dish of Calabar bean oil. A few days
later, he found white crystals in the oil.
Searching the literature, he found that these crystals were a plant steroid
called stigmasterol. Small amounts of stigmasterol were also found in soybean
oil, and Julian now had plenty of that at Glidden. He was confident that he
could convert it into progesterone, if he could find a way to extract this
stigmasterol from the oil.
But Julian was not the only one who saw the potential of making steroids
from plants. In 1938, a chemist named Russell Marker found a way to convert
steroids from sarsaparilla root into progesterone, by chemically snipping off
the "side chain" of extra atoms from the plant steroid. It was breakthrough
chemistry, but progesterone made from sarsaparilla root was too expensive to be
practical. The race was on for a cheaper source.
GREGORY PETSKO: I think that both Percy Julian and Russell Marker
understood the medical implications of what they were trying to do, that they
knew if those natural products could be provided in quantity, that the face of
medicine would be changed.
NARRATOR: Marker published paper after paper, documenting his
search for a plant that would yield cheap progesterone. Julian saw his chance
slipping away. There wasn't much time for this kind of research amid the daily
demands of his job.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): One day the phone rang, and the
fellow said, "Doc, something's happened. Some water's leaked into Soybean Oil
Tank No. 1, and it's spoiled. "Spoiled?" I said. "Spoiled? What do you mean
spoiled?" Now, you understand, this tank contained 100,000 gallons of refined
soybean oil bound for the Durkee Famous Foods plant. If it were ruined, Glidden
would be out $200,000. And such a blunder might cost me my job, so I was over
there in a jiffy. NARRATOR: Julian found the giant tank fouled with white
sludge. But his despair vanished in a flash of recognition: there were crystals
in the sludge at the bottom of the tank. They were stigmasterol, the same
crystals he'd found in the dish of Calabar oil. Now he realized what had forced
the stigmasterol out of both oils, water. JACK COOK:	You couldn't destroy a 100,000-gallon tank of soybean oil to
get this steroid out, but when you add a little water to it, it falls out. It
precipitates. It separates on its own.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And it was this little accidental
discovery—the kind that characterize the development of science so
often—that led to a practical method for the isolation of steroids from
soybean oil.
NARRATOR: Now a step ahead of Marker, Julian developed an
industrial process for converting stigmasterol into progesterone in
bulk.
NED HEINDEL:	Julian did not discover the primary chemistry that took
stigmasterol over to progesterone—that came out of a German group five
years earlier—but he was the first person to realize that it could be
scaled up. A company that's in the paint business suddenly becomes a player in
the human sex hormone game.
NARRATOR: In 1940, Julian sent a one-pound package of
progesterone to the Upjohn pharmaceutical company. Shipped under armed guard
and valued at nearly $70,000, it was the first commercial shipment of an
artificial sex hormone produced anywhere in America.
Testosterone and other artificial sex hormones soon followed, bringing
millions of dollars in unexpected revenue to Glidden.
Despite his growing stature, Julian was barred from a major hormone
conference held at an exclusive resort in Maryland. Only after three days of
protest by his white colleagues was he finally admitted.
Within a year, Julian would face a new challenge: his rival, Russell
Marker, had discovered a giant yam in Mexico. It was even richer in steroids
than soybeans. In 1944, Marker and two partners formed a company called Syntex
to make hormones from the yam. For the rest of the decade, Syntex and Glidden
would produce most of the world's supply of artificial sex hormones.
GREGORY PETSKO: I think the decision to make substances like steroids
from plants, rather than from animal tissues, was a landmark in the history of
medicine as well as the history of chemistry. It meant that you could take
steroids that before were so rare that you barely knew what they were, and you
could inject them into animals or people and see their effects on a variety of
conditions. The possibilities that that opened up almost were limitless.
NARRATOR: The work of Julian and Marker would lay the
foundation for a whole new class of medicines, including the birth control pill
and a wonder drug that would soon take the world by storm.
By the mid-1940s, Julian's work at Glidden had won him national acclaim.
With the outbreak of World War II, his Alpha protein became the chief
ingredient in "bean soup," a fire-fighting foam credited with saving thousands
of servicemen's lives. He was even featured in Reader's Digest, one of
America's most popular magazines.
HELEN PRINTY:	It was the beginning of white America's exposure to Dr.
Percy Julian, and how he had to fight to overcome the odds of being a black man
in America. And, in the context of the times, it made him a symbol.
JAMES SHOFFNER: Here was a person who looked like me, who was not only
in the field, but succeeding magnificently at the top of his profession. That
was profound.
NARRATOR: Julian was named to the boards of half a dozen
colleges and universities. He was showered with awards and honorary degrees and
sought after as a public speaker. The NAACP awarded him its prestigious
Spingarn Medal, previously given to W.E.B. Du Bois, George Washington Carver,
Paul Robeson and Thurgood Marshall. And the Chicago Sun-Times named him
"Chicagoan of the Year."
As Julian's stature grew, so did his personal responsibilities. Anna had
given birth to a son, Percy Jr., in 1940, and a daughter, Faith, four years
later. With so many demands on Percy's time, Anna shouldered the parenting
duties. "For the children," she later wrote, "an after-dinner visit with their
father was a rare treat."
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: I hardly remember a weekend when he didn't work, but
the time you had was quality time.
NARRATOR: By the end of the 1940s, the family had outgrown
their Maywood home. The Julians began looking for a bigger one in a
neighborhood that suited their new social status. They set their sights on Oak
Park, one of Chicago's most affluent and exclusive suburbs.
The village was home to doctors, lawyers and wealthy
businessmen. It had a reputation as a town for the educated and
enlightened.
VIRGINIA CASSIN (Oak Park, Illinois Resident): It's always been a
community that was...had a little sense of its importance as far as being,
perhaps, a cut above others.
V/O MAN (Radio): Thanks to our good friends, the makers of
Broadcast Brand corned beef hash.
NARRATOR: Oak Park even had its own radio show, familiar to
listeners all over America as Breakfast with the Johnsons.
V/O CHILD (Radio): Daddy, I have to give a report in school, so
I'm going to give it to you.
CLIFF JOHNSON (CBS radio host): These days, they'd call it
reality radio, and that's what it was; 7:30 in the morning, Monday through
Friday. The microphones were all over the house. The children would wander in,
and the milkman would come in. We talked about us and the world around us.
NARRATOR: The world around the Johnsons was cultured,
privileged and white. The few African Americans who lived in Oak Park worked as
servants and laborers.
ROBERTA L. RAYMOND (Sociologist): When the Julians came along,
I'm sure that this was a shock to many people who lived in Oak Park. Here they
are, two very well educated people, both with Ph.D.s, he, a very successful
chemist and businessman, and they purchased a house, a large house, on a large
lot.
CLIFF JOHNSON:	There was some nasty tongue-wagging going on: "Who do
these people think they are that they can move in here and take over our
neighborhood?"
NARRATOR: Trouble began even before the Julians could move
in.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: My dad was out of town, and my mom got a call from
the Oak Park Fire Department. "Something has occurred at the house," this is
the fire department, "could you please come." Even as a 10-year-old I knew that
this was arson. There was no attempt to hide this, to make it look like an
accident. I see these bottles, these huge bottles, and I could smell gasoline.
The stairs were soaked all the way up to the second floor.
I think my mother was scared. But if she was, she didn't show it.
They lit the fuse on the outside. The door caught on, but it was sealed so
well that the flames couldn't get under the door. But had the bottles caught,
the flames would have gone right up the stairwell—a natural
chimney—and the house could've been a total loss.
And I looked at my mom, and I said, "Why would anybody do this?" And she
explained it: they didn't want us to live there and didn't want us to live
there because of the color of our skin.
NARRATOR: Now Percy Julian, accomplished, affluent, ambitious,
was face to face with the same violence African Americans all over Chicago were
encountering as they tried to move into white neighborhoods.
VERNON JARRETT (Newspaper Reporter): After the war, when the
ghetto was bursting at the seams and people trying to move out, every first
Negro, they said, to move in a block was going to catch hell. A mob would be
out there to greet you. I've seen it, covered it.
NARRATOR: There were no mobs in Oak Park, but the arson was a
clear warning that some in the community would stop at nothing to keep the
Julians out.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: The arson attempt did not succeed in intimidating my
mom and dad. Nor could it have. They were simply not intimidatable.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Once the violence began, Anna and I
felt we had no choice but to stay. To leave would have been cowardly and wrong.
The right of a people to live where they want to, without fear, is more
important than my science. I was ready to give up my science and my life to
bring a halt to this senseless terrorism.
NARRATOR: The Julians moved in. And when a few months passed
with no further trouble, Percy and Anna felt confident enough to go out of
town, leaving the children with a babysitter.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: The first my parents saw of it was when they saw it
in the paper the next day, with me pointing to the hole in the ground. CLIFF JOHNSON:	I'll never forget the morning my daughter Sandra said,
"Daddy, they bombed my friend Percy Julian's house last night." And then she
said, "Daddy, why did they do that? Why would they bomb their house?" I put on
a record, because I didn't have the answer.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: My dad was angry when he came home, I mean really
angry, and clearly ready to fight. He looked at this as an attempt to murder
his kids. For him, there was nothing redeemable about them at all. I'm taking
this in like there's no tomorrow.
And actually, you know how everything has a good side? The good side was, as a
kid I got to spend more time with my dad, and got to stay up late,'cause we'd
sit in the tree outside. He'd sit there with a shotgun. And we'd talk about why
someone would want to do this and how wrong it was and how stupid it was. NARRATOR: The Julians would continue to receive threatening
letters for years after. No one was ever arrested. Many Oak Park residents were
horrified at the violence against the family.
VIRGINIA CASSIN: I think people were shocked that anyone should be
treated that way. And there were people who came forward to say, there are a
lot of us that don't feel that way.
CLIFF JOHNSON:	There was at least 200 or more people that marched right
up in front of the Julian house on East Avenue and said "He stays, he
stays."
NARRATOR: Even as events in Oak Park threatened to upend his
personal life, a new scientific challenge was drawing Percy Julian into one of
the great medical dramas of the 20th century.
At the center was one of the oldest and most painful of human diseases,
rheumatoid arthritis.
CHARLES PLOTZ (Rheumatologist): Arthritis is a generic word for
inflammation of the joints, and encompasses a lot of different diseases. But
the disease that truly inflames the joint and causes destruction of the
cartilage and the bone within the joint is rheumatoid arthritis. NARRATOR: Scientists had been seeking a cure for rheumatoid
arthritis for hundreds of years. But by the middle of the 20th century those
efforts had yielded only a bizarre assortment of mostly ineffective treatments:
chin slings, gold injections, mineral baths, cobra venom, bee stings, even
electricity.
CHARLES PLOTZ:	People would swear by them, but nothing, over the long
run, worked.
NARRATOR: The situation changed dramatically at the 1949
annual meeting of American rheumatologists. Philip Hench, of the Mayo Clinic,
presented a film showing how arthritis patients responded to a new drug, called
Compound E, and later named "cortisone."
CHARLES PLOTZ:	They were severely crippled, having to drink by holding a
cup in both hands. And Philip Hench gave them an injection, and within 12 to 24
hours, the same patients were having no difficulty at all. It was one of the
most astonishing things that has ever happened in medicine. You didn't need a
double-blind study. You just saw it happen. And the audience stood up and
cheered.
Well, every patient with rheumatoid arthritis immediately wanted to be put on
this magic drug.
NARRATOR: The problem was there was none to be had. Hench had
performed his tests with a few precious grams of cortisone sent to him by Lewis
Sarett, a young chemist at Merck.
Sarett had worked for years to synthesize cortisone from the bile of
slaughtered oxen. But his chemical pathway was the most complex ever attempted
in industry, requiring more than 30 steps. And thousands of cattle carcasses
would be needed to make enough cortisone to treat a single patient for a
year.
To treat the millions suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, scientists would
need to find more a plentiful starting material and simplify the process of
producing cortisone. Chemists from all over the world sprang to the challenge,
launching one of the most intensive research efforts in the history of
medicine.
Julian threw himself into the effort.
JOHN KENLY SMITH: The only reason that Glidden is in the great cortisone
race is because of Percy Julian. He knows this chemistry, and so he can
establish a position for them. The American pharmaceutical industry, after
World War II, is not the giant that we know of today. This business is really
just getting going, so there is room for entrepreneurs in this period.
NARRATOR: One of those entrepreneurs was Carl Djerassi, then a
young chemist at Syntex, the small Mexican company that made hormones from
yams.
CARL DJERASSI (Syntex Chemist): Julian and I were competitors,
and we were in this race with people at Harvard, and at Oxford, and in Zurich,
and at Merck, and, I mean, all the major companies. It was one time when basic
research in industry competed on equal terms with that in universities.
NARRATOR: The prize these chemists were after was not actually
a drug but a natural hormone. Cortisone is one of the many hormones made by the
adrenal glands, two small organs that lie atop the kidneys. Small amounts of
cortisone are always circulating in the bloodstream, controlling the body's
responses to stress and inflammation, but much larger doses of cortisone were
needed to relieve the symptoms of arthritis.
Julian hoped to make cortisone from soybeans, just as he had the sex
hormones. Like progesterone, cortisone had the same four interlocking rings of
carbon known as the steroid nucleus, but cortisone has an unusual feature: one
of its oxygen atoms is in what chemists call position 11. Julian set out to
make cortisone by first synthesizing an almost identical compound called
Reichstein's Substance S, or Compound S. PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Look at the two formulae. Compound
S differs from cortisone by one lone little oxygen atom. And it couldn't
possibly be so strikingly different in properties, I thought. And if it is, why
in the devil, did nature have to put so much in the adrenal glands?
Well, if you really think nature is smart, your guess would be that it's there
as a reservoir from which the adrenals can make cortisone as the body needs it,
by simply sticking in this one oxygen atom.
NARRATOR: Julian hoped to convert Compound S into cortisone,
as the body does, but he knew that inserting that one oxygen atom in exactly
the right place would not be a simple matter.
GREGORY PETSKO: In the body, there's a special enzyme that knows how to
do this, and does it, very elegantly, in a simple reaction. But to do this
chemically, in the lab, in large quantities, was fiendishly difficult.
DAGMAR RINGE:	In the laboratory, in order to add any atom to this carbon
atom requires severe conditions, high heat, high pressure, very reactive
reagents that will attack this atom. The difficulty with those conditions is
that they will attack every other carbon atom on this skeleton as well.
GREGORY PETSKO: You want to put the oxygen only in that position. It
doesn't do you any good to put it there if, simultaneously, you put it
somewhere else where it's not supposed to be.
NARRATOR: Chemists across the world faced the same challenge.
Whatever material they started with, plant or animal, they had to find a way to
insert that one oxygen atom into just the right position. This was the single
biggest obstacle to making cortisone.
As Julian struggled to find a solution, Glidden executives were losing
patience with his Compound S approach.
GREGORY PETSKO: It's hard to read another chemist's mind, but I think
that Julian probably knew that this was so close to the final structure of
cortisone, that if he could make Substance S in large quantities,
inexpensively, he would, eventually, or someone would, eventually, find a way
to insert that troublesome oxygen into the 11 position, because that was the
only remaining step needed to convert that substance into the full-blown
hormone, cortisone.
NARRATOR: But the problem of inserting that one oxygen atom
continued to frustrate chemists for more than two years. The cortisone shortage
became a crisis, as the price topped $4,000 an ounce, one hundred times the
price of gold.
CHARLES PLOTZ:	I would get requests from all over the country, "Can't
you get me some cortisone? Can't you get me a little cortisone for me? For my
aunt? For my patient?" And I couldn't get it, for me or for anybody.
NARRATOR: Finally, in the summer of 1951, four teams of
chemists announced they had found new ways to make cortisone. The winners
included teams from Harvard, Merck and Syntex.
CARL DJERASSI:	We got an enormous amount of publicity, including
LIFE magazine and places like this, and that put Syntex on the
scientific map.
NARRATOR: But the chemists' glory was short-lived. Six months
later, they were upstaged by a surprising discovery from scientists at Upjohn,
in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
V/O (Film Clip): From laboratories in Michigan comes the new
process for making unlimited quantities of cortisone.
CARL DJERASSI:	That bubble of conceit and pride and pleasure was
completely punctured, when we discovered there were these yokels in Kalamazoo
who, in one step, did something that took us 15 steps—very clever
steps—to do.
NARRATOR: These so-called "yokels" had discovered a common
mold that could effortlessly insert an oxygen atom into the 11 position.
GREGORY PETSKO: Upjohn figured out that they could do it by a
fermentation process. In other words, it wasn't done in a chemistry lab at all.
It was done by a microorganism that possessed an enzyme that was capable, just
like the human body is capable, of attaching an oxygen in exactly the right
place.
NARRATOR: Upjohn's discovery was the breakthrough that would
end the cortisone shortage. Its mold could work its oxygen-inserting magic on a
range of steroid materials, including Julian's Compound S.
GREGORY PETSKO: All of a sudden, Substance S was very important. This
compound, that didn't have any particular important biological activities of
its own, became ideal as a starting material to produce cortisone. And Julian
was sitting on the process to make that.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Many well-meaning people have
exaggerated my contribution to the chemistry of the cortisone family of drugs.
I've even read somewhere that I was "the discoverer of cortisone." Not so. But
we made a good choice, indeed, in choosing to synthesize Compound S as our
first endeavor. Cortisone could now be made from Compound S simply by dumping
it into a tank, throwing in a microorganism and fishing out cortisone after the
organism has done its work.
NARRATOR: But Julian's Compound S was not the only material
Upjohn's mold could transform into cortisone.
CARL DJERASSI:	Suddenly, Upjohn came to Syntex—I still remember,
because I was there—and said, "Would you quote us the cost of
progesterone at a ton level." Well, we were completely flabbergasted. At that
time, still, the world demand was a few hundred kilos.
NARRATOR: The request could mean only one thing: Upjohn had
decided to produce cortisone from progesterone made by Syntex, not from
Julian's Compound S.
Syntex had a big advantage: its starting material, the Mexican yam, was a
richer source of steroids than the soybean, so cortisone made this way was
cheaper.
But other companies were also gearing up to produce cortisone. Julian could
still win their business, if he abandoned soybeans and made Compound S from the
Mexican yam. But when Julian appealed to Glidden's chairman to make the switch,
the answer was, "No."
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I begged him to hold on; we could
set up a simple yam processing plant in Mexico, and with Glidden's influence we
could soon be masters of the field. But he had other plans for me in paint and
varnish chemistry, new paint to prevent icing on airplane propellers, new
shortenings that didn't spatter. JOHN KENLY SMITH: I think the steroid work that Julian was doing was
just one of those little businesses that no longer were seen as important to
the company and its future direction.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): They sent me to Europe, for a
vacation, to forget about it. And, on my return, the chairman announced that
Glidden was going out of the steroid business altogether.
HELEN PRINTY:	This was a blow to the heart of Doc. And he said he didn't
know whether he'd be able to stand that, because if there was no steroid
research, there was nothing that he could really interest himself in.
NARRATOR: Joyce licensed Compound S to Pfizer and Syntex and
ordered Julian to teach their chemists how to use the process he'd
invented.
HELEN PRINTY:	And things just kept getting worse and worse and worse,
until finally it just became untenable for him.
NARRATOR: In late 1953, Percy Julian walked away from the job
into which he'd put the most productive years of his life.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And when I left Glidden, I left
behind 109 patents, for which I received $109 and other valuable
considerations.
NARRATOR: One of those patents was for Compound S. Just as
Julian predicted, it went on to become a key ingredient in the production of
cortisone, helping to make the drug available to millions at a reasonable
price.
GREGORY PETSKO: The fact that Julian could do what he did, while working
in a paint company, strikes me as just remarkable. He didn't just do these
things because glory would be his, if he succeeded. There always is, in
Julian's work, this sense of aiming for something big, because it's going to be
useful for people.
NARRATOR: But to fulfill his ambition Julian would now have to
reinvent himself as a businessman in one of the most cutthroat industries in
America.
Within a few months Julian was back on his feet as president of his own
chemical company in Franklin Park, outside Chicago.
HELEN PRINTY:	We had left the Glidden Company and moved out to this
place that was loaded with rats and mice and everything else. You couldn't eat
your lunch without a mouse coming out.
PETER WALTON: Working conditions, I guess, would be considered
primitive.
NARRATOR: But for Julian it was the chance of a lifetime.
After 18 years at Glidden, he was his own boss, free to focus on work that
excited him.
His plan for success was simple: Julian Laboratories would make steroid
intermediates, compounds that were often just one step short of a finished
product. The big pharmaceutical companies would buy them, because Julian could
make them faster and cheaper than they could.
From his old friends at Upjohn, Julian quickly landed a contract for $2
million worth of progesterone. More business followed from Ciba, Pfizer, Merck
and others. There was just one obstacle: Syntex, the Mexican company that now
dominated the hormone business.
Syntex controlled the supply of the Mexican yam, or barbasco, root. Julian
needed an extract from the root to make his intermediates cheaply, but Syntex
refused to sell him any. It was a setback that threatened the company.
PETER WALTON:	Having put it all on the line with these major
pharmaceutical companies, he had to deliver the goods, had to.
NARRATOR: To get around Syntex, Julian would have to build his
own $300,000 barbasco processing plant in Mexico.
PETER WALTON:	Dr. Julian didn't have the necessary capital himself. The
conventional...normal banking sources were off limits to people of color,
period.
NARRATOR: Using personal savings and money from friends and
private investors, Julian was able to build the plant. But then, another
roadblock: the Mexican government, closely tied to Syntex, refused him a permit
to harvest the barbasco root. His expensive Mexican factory was useless.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And there we stood, with our
beautiful plant, our beautifully lighted water tower with Laboratorios de
Julian de Mexico emblazoned on it, a mausoleum. I sat in a hotel in Mexico City
wondering whether I should shoot my brains out.
PETER WALTON:	There was enormous pressure on Dr. Julian, because the
financial stakes were huge, were huge. He had everything invested, between
Franklin Park and Mexico, and so this was a pressure, pressure time.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): And then a strange thing happened.
There was a knock on the door, and in came a man named Abraham Zlotnik, a man
that I had helped out of Hitler's Germany. Abe said he was sure the yam grew in
Guatemala, and he volunteered to make an expedition for me. I told him I was
broke, ruined. I didn't know when I could pay him back. But he said, "You've
already paid me back."
NARRATOR: Zlotnik was as good as his word. His expedition
found the barbasco root in Guatemala. Julian now had the raw material he needed
to achieve his goal: making steroid drugs available to all who needed
them.
JAMES LETTON:	He always talked about being able to lower the cost of
some of these anti-inflammatory agents, these steroids, so that the common man
could buy them.
NARRATOR: Even if it meant lower profits for Julian
Laboratories. One year his chemists found a way to quadruple the yield on a
product on which they were barely breaking even.
JAMES LETTON:	I thought, personally, that that was a good opportunity to
recover some profits from the low yields of the previous year. Instead, he
dropped the price of this stuff from $4,000 a kilo down to about $400 a kilo.
And I couldn't understand why he would do that.
HELEN PRINTY:	He wanted to make money, but he also wanted things to be
available for people.
NARRATOR: Much of Julian's own money was still tied up in his
idle Mexican plant. To make good on that investment he would have to resolve
some unfinished business with an old rival.
V/O MAN (Senate Hearing Dramatization): Would Dr. Percy Julian
come forward?
NARRATOR: Julian believed Syntex had used its influence with
the Mexican government to keep his factory from opening. After other American
companies made similar charges, the Senate held public hearings in 1956. Julian
was the star witness.
HOLLABAUGH (Senate Hearing Dramatization): Was there any company
in Mexico objecting to your getting a permit?
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): It became very evident that the
Syntex Company was objecting to the permit. In fact, Dr. Somlo told me he would
fight to the last to keep me and anyone else out of Mexico.
NARRATOR: As a result of the "wonder drug" hearings, the
Justice Department took action against Syntex. Julian was finally able to open
his Mexican plant, but the mounting pressures of running a business left him
little time to savor the hard-won victory.
Every month there were shipments to make and severe financial penalties for
missed deadlines.
PETER WALTON:	We lived, for the most part, in a highly stressed, very
competitive environment—a small company, limited resources, and dealing
with a huge industry.
EARL DAILEY (Julian Laboratories Chemist): There were many
occasions where 2, 3:00 in the morning would come, and you'd still be in the
laboratory, working.
PETER WALTON:	When I complained about the lack of sleep, Dr. Julian
advised me that sleep could be dangerous for my health. I could die in my
sleep, and "while you're contemplating that, go back out to the plant and
continue to work. We have a shipment to get out."
JAMES LETTON:	But there was an unusual sense of loyalty that made people
work and want to see him and the company successful. How else could you get a
crew to work 24 hours a day? This sort of thing.
NARRATOR: And successful it was. Julian Laboratories would
eventually make its founder a millionaire, one of the wealthiest black
businessmen in America. For his chemists, the reward was an opportunity hard to
find anywhere else: a chance to work in their chosen field.
JAMES LETTON:	When I was looking for a job, some people made excuses,
and then there were some that just said, "We don't hire you people."
TOM WEST (Julian Laboratories Chemist): They told me that I was
too well qualified to take a job. I felt that they were saying, "Come back
maybe another time. Come back when you're white."
NARRATOR: Scores of chemists, unwelcome elsewhere, would use
their years with Julian as a springboard to careers in industry and
academia.
PETER WALTON:	I'm proud to say that our laboratories in Franklin Park
employed more black chemists than any other facility in America. On the other
hand, for such a small organization to have such a significant role in true
integration is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in America.
NARRATOR: Outside Julian's lab, America was still a nation
divided by race, and Julian was constantly reminded of it, even at meetings of
the American Chemical Society.
EDWARD MEYER (Glidden Chemist): When we went to the meeting he
said, "Ed, grab me by the arm, when we go in, so people will know that we're
together." Because he was afraid they'd...being a black man, they'd throw him
out.
NARRATOR: Neither wealth nor fame could insulate Julian from
bigotry. But with success came the chance to do something about it.
Increasingly, he set aside his science to fight for racial equality.
He joined the NAACP and the Urban League in their battle against
discrimination in jobs and housing. He led a national fundraising campaign to
support civil rights lawyers. And in speech after speech, he preached that
education and the pursuit of excellence, the hallmarks of his own life, were
the keys to black advancement.
But many younger African Americans were impatient with traditional tactics
and rejected the sermons of Julian's generation.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Our children and our grandchildren
saw all of this and suffered for their oft-times "Uncle Tom" parents who seemed
to be doing nothing about it. Finally, their pent up agony exploded on us.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: I would say, "Explain this to me: how is it that this
is all going to change?" He would say, "Well, it will. There are lawyers, and
they are going to fight for change. And if you set an example, things will
change." Well, I don't have forever.
NARRATOR: In the1960s, Julian's son drove to Nashville to join
the effort to desegregate the city's lunch counters.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: On the one hand, he was very proud, but on the other,
he was very scared. One time he said to me, "You know, this is not a game.
These people are playing for real." And my response was, "So are we."
NARRATOR: The '60s were an awakening for Julian. He came to
see that the nation could not afford to wait for the old ways to work.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): For more than a century, since the
end of slavery, we have watched the denial of elemental liberty to millions of
black people in our southland.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: I think he saw that things were moving so fast, that
if the country didn't change, there was going to be serious, serious
trouble.
NARRATOR: By the late 1960s, Julian had come to support the
more confrontational tactics of his son's generation.
PERCY JULIAN, JR.: My father wrote, later, it wasn't going to be enough
just to be a model citizen, to be educated, to do all the things that anybody
could possibly expect of you, because none of that would ever change the fact
that you still couldn't go and eat in a restaurant that didn't want to serve
you.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): Branded, first, unfit to spend
their money for food or drink in public places along with other Americans;
denied the ballot and confined to ghettoes that stifled hope and ambition,
victims of murder of the mind, heart and spirit: this is the story of the
American Negro.
NARRATOR: Percy Julian's own story now entered its final
chapter. Born in 1899, he was now in his 70s and a proud grandfather.
KATHERINE JULIAN, M.D. (Percy Julian's Granddaughter): I
definitely was aware that my grandfather was special. I remember playing with a
doll that had been sent to him by a woman, and the story was told me why it had
been sent. She had such bad arthritis that she couldn't use her hands. And
after using cortisone, she was able to knit this doll and sent it to him. And I
remember holding the doll and playing with the doll, and realizing that he had
helped her, and that that was something that was really special.
NARRATOR: For his contributions to humanity, Julian received
18 honorary degrees and more than a dozen civic and scientific awards.
BERNHARD WITKOP: There was hardly any college that didn't try to honor
itself by naming Percy Julian as an honorary Ph.D., because that was the time
when people tried to make up for past injustice.
NARRATOR: Julian's longtime friend Bernhard Witkop envisioned
a higher honor. He secretly began a campaign to elect Julian to the prestigious
National Academy of Sciences. It was an uphill battle.
BERNHARD WITKOP: We had, sometimes, prejudicial talk in the Academy, by
old timers. Some were very famous people and Nobel laureates who couldn't get
used to the new situation.
NARRATOR: Witkop persisted, and in 1973, Julian received an
unexpected phone call from the Academy's home secretary.
BERNHARD WITKOP: He said, "Sir, may I inform you that you have just been
elected a member of the National Academy. Congratulations."
NARRATOR: Julian was only the second African American to be
elected. It was the crowning recognition of 40 years of chemical
research.
NED HEINDEL:	If you look at Percy Julian's career, you can say, if this
man had not been black, he could have been a chaired professor at any Ivy or
Big Ten institution. The breadth of his understanding of chemistry, and his
fire in the belly to produce so many results in such a short period of time,
this is Nobel Laureate stuff. NARRATOR: Looking back in the autobiography he would never
finish, Julian offered his own assessment of his life in science.
PERCY JULIAN (Dramatization): I feel that my own good country
robbed me of the chance for some of the great experiences that I would have
liked to live through. Instead, I took a job where I could get one and tried to
make the best of it. I have been, perhaps, a good chemist, but not the chemist
that I dreamed of being.
NARRATOR: In April 1975, a week after his 76th birthday, Percy
Julian died of cancer. His pallbearers included the chemists who had been his
friends and colleagues.
Every year, the U.S. Postal Service issues a commemorative stamp to honor
an African American leader. In 1993, the choice was Percy Julian.
HELEN PRINTY:	As a human being, I think that he was a source of
inspiration to many, many, many people.
NARRATOR: In 1999, the American Chemical Society recognized
Julian's synthesis of the glaucoma drug physostigmine as one of the top 25
achievements in the history of American chemistry.
The plaque is housed in the new Percy Julian Science Center at
DePauw.
GREGORY ROBINSON: For him to have accomplished what he did, with the
resources that he had, is still amazing.
NARRATOR: Across the world today, millions of people benefit
from steroid medications based on the chemistry of plants. Some of these drugs
are still made from soybeans, using chemical steps much like those Percy Julian
pioneered.
GREGORY PETSKO: Here was a man who not only had to overcome the
disadvantages of his race, but who, throughout his entire life, was in a
situation that was never ideal for doing the big things he was trying to do.
Looking over his life, one has a sense that here is a man of great
determination. And it's a determination not just to succeed, but a
determination to make a difference, to make a contribution.
JAMES ANDERSON: His story is really a contradictory one; it's two
stories. It is a story of great accomplishments, of heroic efforts and
overcoming tremendous odds. But it's also a story of talent squandered, of
potential stifled. It's a story about this country. It's a story about who we
are and what we stand for, and the challenges that have been there, and the
challenges that are still with us.
