"berwici pici pa," 2004
Cedar and graphite, 8 x 86 2/3 x 5 1/2 feet.
Public commission for the Bloomberg Building, New York.
© Ursula von Rydingsvard, courtesy the artist and Galerie Lelong, New York.
"‘Berwici pici pa’ is loaded with lips. (I call it a lip because, of all the parts, it’s the only one that sort of hangs loose toward the front. I could almost call it a kind of apron, but that wouldn’t be quite right. I think lip is closer to it.) The piece has a very flat back, but it’s got these voluptuous lips that come in and scoot out in a way that’s very different from the way my flat pieces function. This is very primitive voluptuous wandering. That’s what I wanted, a procession that you go through, when you enter the building. It’s a kind of procession that the sculpture makes with the people as they walk in."

This week, as Washington Week hosts our first-ever Electronic Town Hall, with audiences in Ohio and Oregon, we ask if the issues that were important to voters in 2008 different than those in 2012? Take a look back at our Road Show from Cleveland, Ohio in 2008. A Presidential Hangout: Inside the World's Most Exclusive ClubhouseOn The RadarYou would never take a second glance at 716 Jackson Place if you were strolling through the neighborhood around the White House and Lafayette Park in Washington, D.C. But the unmarked, four-story, white-painted townhouse with brown sandstone steps is easily the most exclusive club on the planet. You have to call the White House for reservations — and at the moment, only four men are eligible to use it.Read More Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy Discuss 'The Presidents Club'On The RadarNancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy discuss the surprising ways that current and former presidents depend on each other.
How the World's Most Exclusive Club Was BornOn The RadarIt was one of those moments that, in a mere second or two, changed American history: On January 20, 1953, at the inauguration of President Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman greeted Herbert Hoover on the platform. "I think we ought to organize a former presidents club," Hoover suggested. "Fine," Truman replied. "You be the President of the club. And I will be the Secretary." Up to that moment, the Presidents Club was more an idea than an institution.Read More February 24, 2012: Rick Santorum; Super Tuesday; Republican Primary; Unrest in Afghanistan post Quran burningsWeekly ShowRick Santorum is the main target in the GOP race as 13 states prepare to vote between now and Super Tuesday.

About the Film
Robert E. Lee
He is celebrated by handsome equestrian statues in countless cities and towns across the American South, and by two postage stamps issued by the government he fought against during the four bloodiest years in American history. Nearly a century and a half after his death, Robert E. Lee, the leading Confederate general of the American Civil War, remains a source of fascination and, for some, veneration. This two-hour film examines the life and reputation of the Confederacy's pre-eminent general, whose military successes made him the scourge of the Union and the hero of the Confederacy during the Civil War, and who was elevated to almost god-like status by his admirers after his death.

Photo Gallery: Lee the Man
Although we know Robert E. Lee as a central character in America's defining national trauma, the Civil War, many do not know the full character that was Lee. Through these images, we see a very human Lee, from the young boy coping with the abandonment of an admired but disgraced father, to the infirm and short-tempered general who carried the weight of Confederate hopes on his shoulders.

9:30 a.m., 25 Farvardin/April 14 Our columnist Muhammad Sahimi compiled the following news items and commentary:
A large number of political prisoners who are being held in Rajaei Shahr Prison have been on hunger strike for the past four days. They are protesting the terrible conditions at the facility, as well as the denial of their fundamental rights, including the right to furlough and to telephone and meet with their families face to face. They are on a wet strike, meaning that they only drink water. Such prominent political prisoners as Mansour Osanloo, Isa Saharkhiz, Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, Majid Tavakoli, Mehdi Mahmoudian, Kayvan Samimi, and others are among those who are participating in the hunger strike.
After Hossein Shariatmadari, the hardline managing editor of Kayhan, mouthpiece of a faction of the security forces, criticized the producers of the documentary movie about the return of Imam Mahdi, The Appearance Is Imminent, supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, his chief of staff and confidant, began to harshly attack him. The film claims that the return of Imam Mahdi, who disappeared over 1,000 years ago, is nearly at hand and that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ahmadinejad, and Hassan Nasrallah of Lebanese Hezbollah will be the Imam's close aides. Shariatmadari had accused the producers of being linked to Mashaei, and asked rhetorically, "Is it the return of the Imam that is imminent or the elections for the Majles?" The elections are to be held in late February 2012.
In a blog posted by Omid Hosseini on Alef, the website run by conservative Majles deputy Ahmad Tavakoli, the attacks and counterattacks were discussed. Hosseini goes beyond even Shariatmadari's accusations and says that the film is meant to scare people off of criticizing Ahmadinejad and force them to keep him at the heart of the political scene: "If he is linked to Imam Mahdi, why would you criticize him and get rid of him?" At the same time, Mojtaba Zolnour, deputy to Ali Saeedi, Khamenei's representative to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that some clerics believe that Khamenei may indeed be the mythical figure who will help Imam Mahdi on his return. In its Thursday issue, Kayhan persisted in its criticism of The Appearance Is Imminent and the claim that the return of Imam Mahdi is nigh.
The European Union has announced that it will freeze the assets of 32 officials of the Islamic Republic accused of violating Iranians' human rights and ban them from traveling to the E.U. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that the 27-nation union intended a strong response to the "appalling human rights record of Iran." He condemned the detention of Green Movement leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, the imprisonment of more journalists "than any other country in the world," and the Islamic Republic's "excessive use of the death penalty, often on vague charges." Consideration is being given to expanding the list to 80 Iranian officials. The White House issued a statement supporting the sanctions.
The German airline Lufthansa announced that as of Thursday, its aircraft will not be able to refuel in Tehran. Lufthansa operates a daily flight to the Iranian capital. On Tuesday, Mohammad Reza Rahimi, Ahmadinejad's first vice president (Iran has eight vice presidents), announced that because some European countries refuse to provide fuel to Iranian civilian airliners, the Islamic Republic would retaliate by denying their airlines fuel when their planes fly to Tehran. IranAir flights from Tehran to London must stop in a third country to refuel, so Iran responded by denying fuel to the aircraft of the British airline BMI. Flights from Amsterdam to Tehran by the Dutch airline KLM must also refuel in a third country.
Announcing imprisoned Iranian journalist and attorney Nasrin Sotoudeh as the recipient of the annual PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award, Kwame Anthony Appiah, president of PEN American Center, said, "As a writer, as an activist, and as a lawyer she has dedicated herself to a simple and powerful idea: the principle that the rights guaranteed by law are absolute and shared equally by all. At a moment when women and men around the world are standing together peacefully to reclaim this most basic truth, she is in one of the world's most infamous prisons, to the great shame of the Iranian government. In honoring her with this award, we stand with the millions of Iranians she has stood up for and inspired, and we urge individuals and governments around the world to join us in pressing for her immediate release." The award will be presented on April 26 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, the reactionary cleric and Ahamdinejad's avowed spiritual guide, has warned that the Freemasons are reestablishing their network in Iran. Criticizing Ahmadinejad and Mashaei without naming them, Mesbah said, "If we act lazily, when we wake up that darkness has spread everywhere and realize that we actually trained those who created the sedition [the Green Movement]. What is the reason for all the nationalistic talk of an Iranian school of thought, especially when an Islamic movement is taken shape in the Islamic world? What is the motivation...? Today in our society the organization of the Freemasons is forming. Just as during the Constitutional Revolution [1906-11], the Freemasons used Qur'anic and Islamic slogans, today they have also come forward with revolutionary and Islamic slogans." It is widely believed that many officials of the regime of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, as well as many Iranian intellectuals of the past 100 years were secretly members of Freemason Lodges, which were first established in Great Britain.
In a speech in the province of Sistan and Baluchistan, Ahmadinejad declared that Iran is the most powerful nation on earth and no country can hurt it. He said, "George W. Bush began his presidency by frowning and Obama began his with smiles, but the goals of the two are the same.... For years, the U.S. and its allies used stupid and uninformed people to achieve their goals, and hid their true face behind religion, but their goal was to devour the Middle East. Any plot that they have had in the Middle East has benefited Iran. Iran is the most powerful nation in the world."
Kayhan claimed that the person who purchased Ahmadinejad's old car at a charitable auction three and half months ago is under investigation for financial corruption.

It was reported that the man bought Ahmadinejad's car for $2.5 million.
Ahmad al-Qattan, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Egypt said in an interview that his country is hopeful that Iran will not test the military power of his nation. He said that Saudi Arabia has always sought friendship with Iran, but "unfortunately the conspiracies of Iran against the Arab nations of the [Persian] Gulf never ends. They are still dreaming about the Persian empire." He said Iran's claims about Saudi Arabia's intervention in Bahrain are false and absurd, and that he "can prove it." Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majles National Security and Foreign Policy Commission reacted angrily to the report. What al-Qattan said, according to Boroujerdi, is "the policy of Israel and the United States.... Our policy in the Persian Gulf is not entering a military phase, and every country of the region knows this. If Saudi Arabia had not committed its historical mistake in Bahrain, the present strains in the relations between the two nations would not have developed."
On Monday, members of the Basij militia staged a protest in front of the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Tehran and then attacked it with Molotov cocktails. Six or seven such missiles were thrown at the embassy. The militia members were led by Alireza Panahian, a reactionary cleric. The crowd did not have a permit for its gathering, but the police did not stop the militia members from protesting. They tried to pull down the Saudi Arabian flag and replace it with that of the Lebanese Hezbollah, but the police prevented them from doing so. Some of the militia members who carryied Molotov cocktails were arrested, but soon released.
The British Embassy in Tehran has asked its staff not to show up for work until further notice, effectively closing the embassy. Relations between Iran and Britain have been strained for several years. In the latest incident, an Iranian staff member at the embassy was arrested on March 8 and has not yet been released.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast rejected the allegations about the two Iranians on trial in Bahrain charged with spying for Iran. Mehmanparast said that the goal of such a trial is to distract public opinion from what is going on in Bahrain. Along with a Bahraini citizen, the two Iranians have been accused of providing Iran information on Bahraini military and economic matters between 2002 and 2010.
Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaei, has arrived in Egypt to meet with Egyptian officials. This is the first trip by an Iranian official to Egypt since former President Hosni Mubarak was removed from power. Khazaei is also a member of the board of directors of the Iran-Egypt Joint Bank.
Siamak Sohrabi, a graduate student in civil engineering at Sharif University and head of the general council of the school's Muslim Student Association, was released from prison. He was arrested on February 28, after he criticized Reza Sharif, the university's interim chancellor.
Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdieh Golroo, two well-known university activists, have been transferred to solitary confinement in Ward 209 of Evin Prison. Reports indicate that they have not undergone new interrogation and the reason for the move is not clear. The two have been denied the right to see their families for the past three months. Milad Asadi, another well-known university activist, has also been transferred to solitary confinement. At the same time, two other political prisoners -- Ayoub Ghanbarpourian and Hadi Hosseini -- have suddenly been sent to Rajaei Shahr Prison. The former was arrested on June 15, 2009, and is serving a five-year jail sentence, while the latter has been accused of working with al-Qaeda. The reasons for these transfers are also unclear.
Hossein Ebrahimi, deputy chairman of the Majles Commission on National Security and Foreign Policy, claimed that every political prisoner in the country was granted a furlough for Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

Fouad Sajoudi Fariman, a Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering at Amir University of Technology in Tehran, was released from detention after posting $500,000 bail. He had been held for three months, of which he spent 45 days in solitary confinement. He has been given an eight-year jail sentence.
Blogger and political activist Homan Mousavi, age 28, was arrested on April 1, 2009, but after more than two years he is still in "temporary detention." His parents were both executed in the summer of 1988, among over 4,500 political prisoners ordered killed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that year. Mousavi spent 211 days in solitary confinement in Evin's Ward 240, and was then transferred to Ward 209, both of which are run by the Ministry of Intelligence.
