Letter From Maine: New in Town
Somali refugees began arriving in Lewiston, Maine (pop. 36,000) six years ago. Word spread that Lewiston had good schools, a low crime rate and cheap housing — and the Somalis began arriving in droves.

Most newly resettled refugees find work doing entry-level jobs in housekeeping, manufacturing, agriculture and the like and live humbly by American standards.Unemployment in the Somali community is estimated at fifty percent. Alex Nicolaou, an employment counsellor for Catholic Charities in Maine, who works mainly with Somalis, told me that in the Lewiston area a number of refugees are employed by the Dunkin' Donuts plant, a printer and a tampon manufacturer. In Freeport, twenty miles away, L. L. Bean has a giant packing facility that hires many Somalis, particularly during the Christmas season. L. L. Bean's call center, however, like the many telemarketing companies in the area, has few jobs for people with less than standard English. In some cases, Nicolaou believes, employers use his clients' lack of English as an excuse not to hire them. "If language is a problem, we provide interpreters, free of charge," he said. Many jobs, for that matter, don't require more than a small English vocabulary. But some managers don't bother with excuses. "I have actually had employers say, 'I won't hire black people,' " Nicolaou told me. "Or 'I won't hire Muslims.' I had an H.R. person — this was at a big firm — tell me, 'People need to have been in the country at least one year.' I said, 'That's illegal. Why?' She said, 'Because they might be terrorists. They might plant a bomb or something.' "A lot of companies have uniform requirements," Nicolaou went on. "No hijab, or it has to be modified. People want to pray five times a day, and employers ask about that. We explain, 'Just give people a place and a few minutes a day.' That is easily handled. Really, my clients just want to work." In July, a local man threw a frozen pig's head into the Lewiston mosque while people were praying. He claimed that it was a harmless prank, but almost no one believed him, and there were calls for a federal hate-crime prosecution. Top state officials, including the governor, came to Lewiston, just as they had during the duelling rallies of 2003. But among the Somalis, Omar Ahmed told me, the current imam "counselled people not to overreact, to show we are good people by being cool." The man was barred from approaching the mosque and faces a variety of criminal charges, but by fall the incident seemed largely forgotten. The mosque sits behind a scruffy unmarked storefront on Lisbon Street, next to Caveman and Associates Tattoo Studio. Nuh Iman, the imam, is slight, dark-skinned, and full-bearded, and, on the day I met him, he wore a black-and-white-checked shawl and tinted glasses. With a show of reluctance, he took me to a large upstairs room. Persian rugs covered the floor and windows. The room was a mess, and the building seemed to be falling down around us. "The financial condition of this mosque is very low," he said. Iman came to the United States in the nineteen-eighties, he said, as part of a military training program. He was then in the Somali Air Force. But things were deteriorating in Somalia, so he stayed. He had come to Lewiston only in 2005, and he planned to return to his home, in northern Virginia, soon. He found life in Lewiston "a bit slow." I asked him about the Bantus in Lewiston. "These people are not Bantus," he said. "They just say that so they can get distinction as refugees." He told me (contrary to all historical scholarship) that the people known as Somali Bantus are actually members of minor southern Somali clans, and that the real Bantu "were indigenous people all over Somalia—hunters, like the Indians here, who don't want to settle in cities." I asked if the Bantus were not, then, the descendants of slaves. "No, they were not slaves," he said. "Nobody slaved nobody in Somalia." The imam began to talk about religious doctrine, explaining which local jobs were haram. "If you're a drinks waiter, you're poisoning people — that's haram. But if you're just clearing dishes it's O.K." He went on, "People in Somalia like plays and concerts. But every concert is no good, especially when they talk about love and sex. You are waking up the population. Big band is not allowed in Islam. The big drum, saxophone, trombone, xylophone — Satan created those things." Somali women in hijab. Other Somalis in Lewiston take a less puritanical view. The young social worker told me that when Somalis asked him whether it was haram, for example, to deliver a pizza with a bacon topping, he told them to worry about keeping their jobs. Still, there has been a distinct shift, in the past few years, among the Lewiston Somalis, toward stricter religious observance. Women who never wore hijab in Somalia — where miniskirts were once popular in the cities — told me that they always do in Maine. Prayers and fasting have, by all accounts, become more common. In part, this revival predates their migration. Fatuma Hussein, a young mother of five, who fled Mogadishu as a teenager, recalled that during the civil war "people were saying, 'Why did this happen to us? It must be loose women, and drinking alcohol, and going to cinemas.' Even my mother, who is still in Nairobi, she wears the hijab today." (In contrast, the traditional practice of female-genital mutilation, which is almost universal in Somalia, seems to have been abandoned in Maine.) For some, religiosity is a reaction to cultural dislocation. One Somali college student I met who wears the hijab—in her case, an ankle-length black tunic, worn over pants, and a scarf, covering everything but her face and hands—told me that she had begun to do so only six years ago. She spoke immaculate Gen Y English and could knowledgeably discuss hip-hop videos one moment and, in the next, citing the Prophet Muhammad, argue that music is haram. ("It deadens the heart," she said.) For her, living in a non-Muslim country, she said, "My ethnicity is my anchor." Next »

Masterpiece Theatre | The Way We Live Now | Essays + Interviews | An Interview with David Suchet
An Interview with David Suchet
When Anthony Trollope started writing what would become his longest novel, he never dreamed a con artist in a supporting role would take over the plot, swindling not only the characters in the book but the author himself! Such was the force of personality of his creation, Augustus Melmotte. David Suchet's rendition of Melmotte in The Way We Live Now makes it clear what Trollope was up against. No fastidious, obsessive, mincing Hercule Poirot he -- at least, not in this performance.
In addition to his signature roles as Poirot on Mystery! and in the 1992 Masterpiece Theatre production The Secret Agent, Suchet has appeared in the feature films A Perfect Murder, Sunday, Wing Commander, Executive Decision, and RKO 281 on HBO. Among his many stage roles, he has appeared as George (opposite Diana Rigg) in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and as the professor in David Mamet's Oleanna. He made his Broadway stage debut in Peter Hall's Amadeus playing Salieri.
Suchet recently told Masterpiece Theatre: "The joy of my career is I've been very blessed to be able to be an actor in major films, television, theater, and also British radio. In fact, my dream as an actor when I started out was to be able to work in all the media. Thankfully, that's what I'm being given to do."
He went on to describe his most challenging role to date: Melmotte.
Were you a fan of Trollope before you got the role of Melmotte?
No. In fact, my introduction to Trollope was really through this wonderful novel. I based my performance completely on the book, and I'm very pleased to say that the Trollope Society here in London was so thrilled that Melmotte was accurately portrayed -- in their opinion -- that they've made me an honorary member of the society.
PBS viewers know you best as Poirot on Mystery! Do you see any resemblance between Poirot and Melmotte?
None whatsoever. They are as dissimilar as any character you could read on a page or see on the screen or meet in the street or say hello to in a restaurant. If you saw Melmotte sitting next to Poirot, their appearance, clothing, family background, attitudes, morals, tastes, everything about them would be completely different. I must say that playing Melmotte was nothing at all similar to anything I've tried before.
So how do you do it?
You go to the book. With Poirot I had over 60 or 70 stories to draw on, so it was a far greater chance for me -- or for Agatha Christie -- to develop the character. With Melmotte I just had Trollope's one novel, which made it all the more important to be as accurate to the original as possible. When you're doing characters from famous novels, you have a responsibility as an actor to make it what the writer intended. And then you add and expand from there to create a three-dimensional performance.
Did you draw on real-life examples? Melmotte does have his share of contemporary equivalents.
When I read the script, the man who immediately came to mind was Robert Maxwell, the British businessman and media tycoon who drowned in 1991. After his death it came out that he was involved in all sorts of dishonest financial manipulation. Extraordinarily enough, Maxwell's life almost exactly mirrors Melmotte's, and it has been said that he was a 20th-century Augustus Melmotte. So I was able to draw on his example, and in doing so I didn't deny myself fattening things to eat. I put on a lot of weight and really got into the role.
Did you ever meet Robert Maxwell?
No. I met a relative of his while researching the role. I'm not at liberty to divulge who, but that person was a great help to me.
How did you go about developing Melmotte's accent?
It was interesting. Trollope originally thought Melmotte should be an Irishman, but then in his first description of Melmotte in the novel, he has him coming from the continent and talking with an undefined accent. I tried to place him from middle Europe, sounding vaguely Hungarian without being too specific. The most important thing is that he's from Central Europe and he is an outsider in English society. That was exactly the case with Robert Maxwell, who was originally from Czechoslovakia. The only difference between Maxwell and Melmotte is that Maxwell learned how to speak English without any accent from listening to the BBC. But they both called themselves Englishmen.
Those bushy eyebrows -- are those yours?
Yes, they're mine. For Poirot, I keep them trim. This time I just let them out. It's not my hair, though.
Do you think that someone who is a great swindler has to be a great actor?
Yes. The thing about Melmotte and Maxwell is that both had enormous charm, with totally convincing, wonderfully winning ways. In addition to being good actors, both knew how to manipulate people. They were great salesmen. I suppose that's the key. A successful swindler has to be a great salesman even more than a great actor.
Take us through the mechanics of Melmotte's swindle.
Melmotte's modus operandi was this: He would take a brilliant idea, form a company, sell stock, and use that money to set up another company, sell shares in that company, get more money, and so on. He might have five or six companies going all at the same time. He wouldn't bother with running the companies. He would just take all that money, for as long as he could keep it coming in, and have a wonderful life.
His partner, Croll, is nervous that Melmotte is getting to enjoy his wonderful life too much.
Yes. In the past, Melmotte has always been found out but got away. What's ironic is that he has a chance to make a fortune honestly, if only he builds the railway from Salt Lake City to Vera Cruz. He has the money; he has the people. All he has to do is pay the workers, and in all probability he'll make a tremendous profit for the company, but he wouldn't have so much for himself. Part of Trollope's satire is to make this outsider wealthier than anyone else, so that the society of London, irrespective of their dislike of him, stick to him like leeches to get a piece of what he has.
When Melmotte first hears the proposal to build the railway from Paul Montague, he says, "Who on earth would want to take a train journey from Salt Lake City to Vera Cruz?" And then he looks at him and says, "I wouldn't!" In fact, the railways were the great speculative investment of the era, with lines opening up everywhere and many of them making a great deal of money. Melmotte eventually seizes the opportunity, but not in the way his investors think.
With Mrs. Hurtle, the American who shot a man in Oregon and threatens to shoot Paul if he doesn't marry her, do you think Trollope was poking fun at Americans?
No, not in any way at all. He was taking the cliché femme fatale and satirizing that. She was quite a woman, with her whips and pistols, but I don't think she was meant to be a parody of Americans.
At the end, when everything starts to unravel for Melmotte, there's a scene when he barks like a dog. Was it difficult for you as an actor to show this supremely confident man falling apart?
It was the biggest challenge of my career on the screen. It was incredibly difficult. Those barks, by the way, were my invention. He was very inebriated at that point and slightly insane through his desperate situation. One thing you have to do when you have ideas like that is try them out and not care what people think. It seemed to be the right thing for him to do. It certainly wasn't easy, though.
Did it take a number of takes to get it right?
In actual fact, that particular scene only had two takes. No, what it takes is a lot of courage, because you're surrounded by people on a film set, and you've just got to let go. That's the thing about film acting and television acting. You just release yourself and do what is true for the moment, and ignore everybody and everything and all the technical razzmatazz that goes on.
When you're in the middle of a challenging role like this, do you find yourself taking the character home, unable to escape it at the end of the day?
I think what every actor takes home when playing such a huge character as this is the anxiety that you may have not done the part justice on that particular day. You don't take the character home; you take the worries of anybody who is doing a very difficult job. People in business or medicine face these worries. It's important not to make too much of them. It was a terrific responsibility that I had insofar as English literature is concerned. Melmotte is one of the greatest villains of all time. But he is generally forgotten now, and I wanted to elevate him to people's consciousness. He is a huge rogue and should be up there with the best of them.

Why are you in the music business?
Why? Because I grew up in a very musical, entertainment family. There's really nothing else that I could do. I mean my parents would be probably shocked if I said I was going to be lawyer or something. So it's just, it's in my blood. Tell us about your ambitions as a performer. What do you want to be? What do you do?
I want everything. I want it all. I want to have a career in music, and film, and I want a restaurant. You know, I want everything, everything.
How will you get it?
I know it's difficult. I know it's a tough business and everybody is a singer, and everybody is trying to make it and whatever, but it's just perseverance I think. You just have to keep going.
My dad, Mark Hudson, he's a record producer/songwriter. He was in a group in the '70s, the Hudson Brothers, and I've just seen his evolvement, his ups and downs. There was months or years where he didn't have a job. He kept at it, he kept going, and then all of a sudden he had like a number one single. So he was strong and he had so much perseverance and he kept going.
What is it about you that makes you think you have it?
I mean, I'm good [laughs]. You know, like, it's just something that I think people are born with. It's kind of unexplainable. But it's talent and it's ambition and it's just like this kind of cosmic gift. Sarah Hudson is a singer/songwriter who will release her first record, Naked Truth, in July 2004. In this interview, she talks about the making of her album and how she is trying to distinguish herself from other female singer/songwriters. She also recounts the lessons she learned from watching her father, record producer and songwriter Mark Hudson, navigate the business. "My gut, since I've been like three years old, has always said I'm going to be successful in something that I do," she tells FRONTLINE. "Hopefully it's going to be this." This transcript is drawn from two interviews, conducted on Feb. 9 and March 14, 2004
Have you always been good? Like when you were a little kid were you good?
I definitely was like, you know, out there, and unique, but I think definitely over time, and with experience, you get better and better. And I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm pretty impressive. How does the audience, from your point of view, judge whether you're worth spending $19 on, $14 on?
If they feel a connection. It's all about connecting with the audience through your songs, through your lyrics, and through your performance. You have to feel that spark with somebody onstage. I definitely felt that with performers that I've gone and seen. That's what's most important, because it's the fans and it's the world and your audience that's going to support you and make you who you are as an artist. Who do you like?
So many people. Madonna is a huge one for me, I love her. Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon, Janet Jackson, like so many people, Tori Amos. Lots of different variety. But they're all people that when I go and see live, they bring something to me and to my life, and I feel an emotional connection with them as well as watching them and being entertained by them.
How much have you wanted to be paid to be a performer? I'm not talking about millions of dollars, just to make a living and do it for a lifestyle.
It's all that I want. It's like the only thing that I want. Because, you know, everybody needs to make a living. Everybody needs to support themselves. And usually people do what they're best at. So this is what I think I'm best at, and it would be a dream to be able to support myself and make a living off of my art and my talent. And getting rich?
It would nice. The success, or fame really, isn't a priority. It's not the first priority for me, because the music is what I love. And the writing of the songs, and performing, and connecting, that's what I love. But definitely if I can get rich from it, who wouldn't want that? [laughs] It's not a bad thing. I'd like to buy my mom a house one day. Tell me about [making a record]. How did the idea of making a record get started? Who paid for it? How did you get a label? …
I went to music school for a year, after high school, and then after that I started really writing songs, and I met a publisher … and she signed me to an artist publishing deal. She connected me with amazing songwriters everywhere, in L.A., New York, London, everywhere. I just wrote and wrote and wrote and kind of found my own voice and, you know, what I wanted to say as an artist and discovered who I am, or who I was at that time. And then I met -- my manager is David Simoné and Winston Simoné. They really loved the songs and they wanted to get behind it and try to get me a record deal. And so we did some showcases with me and a guitar player with tracks. It was very like, you know, slapped together, but I guess it worked. And we had meetings and Joanna Ifrah, she signed me about, maybe two and a half years ago, to London Sire Records. And as soon as things started to kind of get moving, London Sire folded. So I was without a label and, you know, what was I going to do?
But Joanna was really supportive and she really loved the project, and me, and the songs, and so she took me with her over to EMI, to S-Curve/EMI and signed me over there. So that was about maybe a year and a half ago. And I continued to write, and she pushed me to dig deep and really write heartfelt meaningful songs to me. And we just made a record. We found really great producers that I connected with, and it kind of all came together in about six months. I would say we finished it maybe four or five months ago. Mixing it and the whole deal. What has to happen in order for it to be a successful release?
You release a single to radio, and the radio people have to be really into it in order to play it, and it just has to connect with the kids, or with the audience, or people that hear it. When they hear it on the radio they would request or they'd say, "Who's that?" You know, so once the connection is made with the world, or with the kids, is when things start to get moving. But it's hard, because there's so many great songs -- and bad songs -- on the radio. So it's difficult. But you have to just believe in the single that goes to radio. And then press, you would want to do lots of interviews and this kind of stuff just to kind of get your face out there and your beliefs, and what you want for this record.
So you'll go to on a tour? Many cities, many states, many radio stations. Yeah, a radio tour. It's about a three-week radio tour and you go and meet with the stations, and kind of, you know, be memorable to them so they'll remember you and they want to play your song. What is being memorable?
I don't know, like making an impression. I would go and perform with a guitar player, so hopefully it would be a good performance, and they'd get behind me as an artist, and the song, and want to put it on the radio.
Do you have a persona? Is there Sarah Hudson persona? Or is it who I'm talking to right now?
It's who you're talking to. I'm a little quirky. I definitely say what's on my mind. I don't know, that's not always a good thing, but-- [laughs].
What are the songs about? What's the music inside you that's coming out on this?
The songs are about growing up and all of the kind of baggage and emotions that come along with coming into adulthood, and finding your own voice and opinions. A few are about my relationship with my parents, and one with my dad, and the ups and downs of your relationship with your parents and realizing that your parents are people and they make mistakes, and how it affects you as a kid. That kind of stuff. It's very diary entry, self-revealing lyrics. And relationships with boyfriends, and that kind of stuff. Just growing up basically. In a world of Liz Phair and Alanis Morisette and everybody else, what distinguishes you?
I think what distinguishes me is that I don't take myself too seriously. You know? I can make fun of myself, and I'm kind of carefree and like quirky. But at the same time, you know, on the record, I deal with real issues, with a relationship with your parents, or just things that you go through as like a young woman or whatever. It's just very self-revealing. I think that a lot of those girls have those kind of records as well, but I think I deal with issues like your parents, which I haven't really heard anything that deals with kind of growing up. It's more like boyfriend trouble, or like relationship drama, or whatever. …
Let's just talk a little bit about the money. Are you surprised at how little or how much it is? … Were you surprised by the deal?
I mean we definitely got enough money to make a good record. Because the people that we worked with were very behind it and into it and, you know, I don't think money was as much of an issue for them. So it worked. But it's definitely hard to support yourself, while you're in this kind of position. I mean you do get an advance from the record company and publishing money, but it's hard. I think with the state of the record industry right now, there's not a lot of money floating around like there used to be. I think people used to throw out like millions of dollars to make a record or to make a video, but unfortunately I don't think it's like that anymore. Money's a lot more sparse.
Did you feel the pressure to create a single that would move and get a jolt, and get the thing going?
Definitely. We definitely had a handful of really good songs, but I felt like there wasn't that one that, you know, you could hear on the radio, or could get people interested right away. So I kept writing, and I wrote with Desmond Child who's just, you know, an amazing songwriter who's written everything from "Living La Vida Loca" to like the new Clay Aiken single. He knows what he's doing.
We wrote a song called "Girl on the Verge," which is the single. And I felt it. I felt it then. I was like, "This is it. This is the single. This is the song." The first song at least, to kind of get out there and get people interested. Hopefully.
People always decry the death of the album. That is, if there's a single everybody goes for it, but there's no deep cuts. Are there deep cuts on this record?
Definitely, yeah. I mean the single that we're going with is kind of the most, kind of light and fun and kind of fluffy song, you know? But the rest of the record is way more intricate and way more kind of heartfelt, and, you know, it's very edgy, the rest of the record. So what we're hoping is to put out this single and get people interested, and then to kind of hit them with the deeper stuff. To show them like, I am a real artist, I'm not just manufactured or put together. That I do actually have something to say. How important is it to you Sarah, to make it? It's really important. It's what I want more than anything. Mostly to get the music out there, and to get, you know, what I have to say, and my beliefs and that kind of stuff, just out there, and out to the kids. Because I think that it's encouraging, you know, what I have to say. It's not like self-deprecating or anything like that. It's something that will hopefully motivate. But that's the most important thing for me. More than fame or any of that stuff. But if you don't get it, if the record fails?
You know, I just have to keep going. I just would have to take it as it comes and whatever happens happens, and, you know, I'd have to keep moving. Because I believe everything happens for a reason. I would just keep doing what I know how to do, which is just write songs, and perform, and you know. Back when your father was coming up, the business was great at artist development. Do you think there's development of you? It sounds like you've had a kind of good story so far.
Yeah, yeah.
But a lot of people got to make a record that sells 15,000, and then 50,000, and then 100,000, and then bam there's a blowup. And nowadays it doesn't seem like anybody gets a chance to do that.
No.
Talk to me a little bit about that.
I don't know if I should say this, but I think with like American Idol and all the kind of TV shows, like the auditioning, like Star Search kind of shows, it's like making it less important. It's making it harder for someone to kind of do it the old-school way. Like I'm a singer. I want to get a record deal and develop as an artist, and actually have like a record label behind you in developing you. Because it's like, it's been made so easy. You know what I'm saying?
Kids can just go and audition and then all of a sudden they're like, the next big thing. You know what I mean? So it seems like it's harder to do it how it used to be done. So I don't know. I definitely [feel] that the stress of trying to get people behind you and support you. And say your record comes out and it does only sell like 20,000 records. There's the fear now that that's it, they're done, you're going to get dropped, you're finished, let's move on. You know what I mean?
Whereas I think maybe like 20 years ago, or however, 10 years ago even I think, they stayed with it, and they kept pushing the artist and the record. And supported the record, which I don't know if they do that so much anymore. I think know it's kind of like, "Okay, we'll put it out, and see how it does, and if it doesn't do well then f---- it." You know? …
You have no idea yet what is going to happen, but there is all this buildup, and it's all sort of setting up for the day when [your record] comes out. What's it like? Is it tense? What's the feeling of the people around you, and how do you feel about it?
It's exciting. It's scary because it's my career and of course I want people to like my music. But it's exciting, you know, because everyone around me is so supportive and amazing. So I think whichever way it goes, if it takes awhile, if it blows up, whichever way it goes I feel like I have a really great, strong team behind me. So I'm excited.
What do you think the odds are that it's going to hit? I mean it sounds like from what everybody says that it's all going according to schedule. What's your gut say?
I mean my gut, since I've been like three years old, has always said I'm going to be successful in something that I do. Hopefully it's going to be this. So, I don't know, my gut is telling me it's going to go well for me, whatever that means, you know. I don't know if being a huge, famous person is what necessarily is success. But I just have a feeling it's going to go how it's supposed to go. And it'll be right.
