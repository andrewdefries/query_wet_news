Art Beat talked with al-Bassam in Kuwait in 2007 when his company was presenting the play, “Richard III: An Arab Tragedy.”Al-Bassam’s latest work is the final part in his Arab Shakespeare Trilogy, a new play called “The Speaker’s Progress”. The play premieres in the United States this weekend at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Al-Bassam wrote the play in 2010, but as he prepared to bring it to the stage for rehearsals in early 2011, he could not deny the historical events happening around him which greatly shifted the shape of the play’s narrative.Al-Bassam joined me on the phone from Brooklyn to talk about the effect of the Arab Spring on his play and on art across the Arab world. (A full transcript is after the jump.)Photos from The Speaker’s Progress at BAM/Courtesy of Richard Termine JEFFREY BROWN: Welcome again to Art Beat. I’m Jeffrey Brown. Several years ago I had the opportunity to visit writer and director Sulayman al-Bassam in Kuwait to talk about his theater work often adapting Shakespeare plays into a contemporary Arab setting. His new work is called The Speaker’s Progress. It’s now opening at the BAM, the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and he’s in New York and joins us on the phone. Nice to talk to you again.SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: Thank you Jeff. Nice to speak to you.JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me about this new work, The Speakers Progress, What is it about?SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: The Speaker’s Progress is the third and final part of a trilogy of Shakespearean pieces that are performed in Arabic that are about the events and changes in the Arab world. And this is a piece that uses Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night as the inset play from which some major strains and themes and lines are taken and the The Speaker’s Progress is a play about change. It’s a play about the process of change and transformation from one state of affairs to another. It is a play that for me is very much concerned with this period that we are moving through in the Arab world at this time.JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, I should say so. So change is the context and change is actually what’s right in front of you these days, just as this was unfolding.SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: Absolutely. The period that we are in at this point in time across the Arab region as I am sure you and your listeners are aware is a period of great historical moments I think. What has been happening since January across different parts of the region and what’s referred to as the Arab awakening or the Arab Spring is really a turning point in our history. The play that began before these events began was a play about the search for a space for freedom. The play was about a retired director who is a former radical theater maker who has become a regime apologist. And it’s the last roll of the dice for him so he brings together his thoughts and presents this play in order to try to reclaim the space for theater to actually affect change and be part of a political process. It ended, in the first version of the play, in a very dark and bitter way. That was a kind of reflection upon my feeling around the state of paralysis and stasis that we were in and that we have been in for so many years and for so many decades.JEFFREY BROWN: When we met of course, that was when you were presenting Richard III and the darkness of using that to explore repressive regimes basically.SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: Tyranny. Absolutely. Richard III was about tyranny and The Speakers Progress was intended to be if you like an epitaph for political theater. It was a piece that was saying that theater and art is no longer able to affect the kind of change that one would hope for and when we took that version into rehearsals, the events around us were moving so fast and with such enormous power that our ending seemed somehow irrelevant, and happily irrelevant I should say. So it became incumbent upon us to rework this piece to look for ways in which the piece could become more about the process of change and the process of transformation that has engulfed the region.JEFFREY BROWN: So that’s how the events of the Arab Spring affected your play. More broadly, I think Americans don’t know that much about the flowering of arts, theater, etc. in the Arab world, so more generally, what kind of impact do you see this having on arts and culture?SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: I think arts, culture and the role of intellectuals and artists in this process has been quite curious. Artists and the process of culture, I think, has stood as a witness to these events, which have been taken forth and played out by very different forces that art and culture had been removed from by a strategy of power over a series of decades. And the positions that are now, the spaces that are now open to free voices in those countries where change has led to political developments because also we have to distinguish between them, it’s a very complicated picture that we have before is you know. One would like to say that all change is for the better but that’s not always true. So we have a very difficult and tumultuous time but the process of movement forward and the emergence from that period of stasis and that period of no voice, that period of no freedom, that period of no space through a peaceful movement as has been the case in Tunis and in Egypt, moving into a space for new voices, new freedoms, and the ability to determine one’s own destiny is enormous for the space it that proposes to artists, the space that it proposes to the way in which we think about what we can make with our art, with theater, with poetry, with literature, but also what we need to say. I think that there needs to be a restructuring of the way we think about our work and that’s really also what The Speaker’s Progress is about. The speaker in his journey through this play comes to the conclusion that the strategies that he had been using for many years to be an opposition figure, to be a political theater maker are no longer valid in this phase. That he himself needs to transform his whole way of thinking and on a personal level for me that means that I feel it’s no longer appropriate to address a critique through the prism of Shakespeare.JEFFREY BROWN: Oh really? Well that’s what I was going to ask finally because you describe this The Speaker’s Progress as the end of a trilogy and of course that trilogy now impacted as you say by world events so what is next for you then?SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: The prism of Shakespeare and the mask of Shakespeare that we’ve discussed when we were together in Kuwait with Richard III is a mask that has taken up to protect and deflect from the dangers of making political theater in a restrictive environment. But when that environment alters and when the sensor is no longer there then we need remove that mask and find a new voice and speak through our own language and perhaps that’s where the need for Shakespeare ends.JEFFREY BROWN: Well that’s very interesting. I wish you good luck with all of that and it’s nice to talk to you again. So The Speaker’s Progress is opening at Brooklyn Academy of Music and then moving on to Boston I guess?SULAYMAN AL-BASSAM: We play at Emerson Arts: The World on Stage from the 12th to the 16th of October.JEFFREY BROWN: Alright Sulayman al-Bassam, the Kuwaiti theater director and writer, thanks so much for talking to us and thank you for joining us again on Art Beat.

Mystery! American Mystery! Specials . Navajoland . About Hillerman-Books | PBS
Like Holmes and Watson or Starsky and Hutch before them, Joe Leaphorn
and Jim Chee have become a classic crime-fighting duo.
See also: Interview
Leaphorn and Chee didn't start out as a classic crime-fighting duo. In fact, they almost didn't exist at all. Leaphorn
was originally a minor character in Tony Hillerman's first novel, while
Chee emerged only when Hillerman found the need for a less savvy
protagonist. Long after their first appearance on the fictional
reservation landscape, they came together finally in Skinwalkers and
have had trouble getting rid of each other ever since.
The Blessing Way, 1970 Leaphorn The first appearance of Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal
Police, who discovers a corpse with a mouth full of sand. Without tracks
or clues, he is ready to suspect a supernatural killer, but unwilling to
jump to that conclusion. He begins the first of many investigations
along the trail of mysticism and murder.
Dance Hall of the Dead, 1973 Leaphorn Detailing seldom-witnessed Zuni religious rites, this Edgar
Award-winning tale follows Leaphorn on his search for two young boys who
have disappeared. An archeological dig, a hypodermic needle, and the
strange laws of the Zuni commingle along the mystifying trail to their
discovery.
Listening Woman, 1978 Leaphorn When an old man and a teenage girl are murdered, the only witness is a
blind Navajo listening woman who speaks of ghosts and witches. While the
state police and FBI spin their wheels, the ever-skeptical Leaphorn
embarks on an investigation that carries him into a 100-year-old
conspiracy. People of Darkness, 1980 Chee
Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police makes his entrance into
the world of crime as he journeys into the Bad Country, where a lone
assassin waits, nursing resentments fed by murder and greed.
The Dark Wind, 1982 Chee
A corpse whose palms and soles have been "scalped" is only the first
strange clue in a deadly web spun by Navajo sorcery and white men's
greed.
Chee must piece together an airplane crash, an attack on a windmill, and
a vanished cocaine shipment in order to solve the crime. The Ghostway, 1984 Chee
Two strangers fight at the Shiprock Wash-O-Mat. One dies. The other
drives off into the Big Reservation, but not before showing Old Joseph a
photo of the man he seeks. That's enough to convince Chee to give chase,
moving from haunted hogan to seedy Los Angeles streets and back to the
reservation for a healing ceremony that turns deadly. Skinwalkers, 1986 Leaphorn & Chee
Leaphorn and Chee join forces for the first time to investigate a trio
of unsolved medicine-man homicides. Is there a connection? Leaphorn and
Chee follow the clues into the spine-tingling world of Navajo
witchcraft. A Thief of Time, 1988 Leaphorn & Chee
Dr. Eleanor Friedman-Bernal arrives at an Anasazi Indian ruin only to
discover that the ancient burial site has been looted. Weeks later,
Leaphorn is investigating a report that she has been stealing precious
artifacts when he discovers the anthropologist has also been reported
missing. On a routine search for missing excavating equipment, Chee
finds strange goings-on at another dig. The two join forces to unravel
the mysteries of an ancient Indian civilization and a series of murders
that revolve around its most beautiful -- and valuable -- legacy:
Anasazi pots.
Talking God, 1989 Leaphorn & Chee
Tracking different cases, Leaphorn and Chee end up in Washington, D.C.,
for multiple crimes at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural
History. While Leaphorn seeks the identity of a murder victim, Chee
arrests Smithsonian conservator Henry Highhawk for ransacking the sacred
bones of his ancestors. As the story unfolds, the cases converge, and
Leaphorn and Chee enter into the dangerous arena of superstition and
political assassination. Coyote Waits, 1990 Leaphorn & Chee Chee's good friend Delbert Nez lies dead, and whiskey-soaked Ashie
Pinto, a Navajo shaman, has the murder weapon. He's quickly arrested for
homicide but won't utter a word of confession or denial, so Leaphorn
begins an investigation. The duo need to solve not just Nez's murder, but those of a University
of New Mexico history professor in search of the graves of Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid and a former South Vietnamese colonel. Soon
Leaphorn and Chee are unraveling a complex plot involving artifacts,
money, and the mythical Coyote.
Sacred Clowns, 1993 Leaphorn & Chee The maverick Chee relies on intuition. Leaphorn plays by the rules.
Overwhelmed by two murder cases, a hit-and-run accident, a tribal
corruption, and a counterfeit racket in sacred artifacts, the two once
again find a way to work together and solve the seemingly unconnected
murders of a mission schoolteacher on the Navajo Reservation and a
Pueblo tribal official amid a troupe of sacred Hopi kachinas. The Fallen Man, 1997 Leaphorn On Halloween a human skeleton is discovered near Ship Rock, the
1,700-foot-high peak that rises like a prow in the desert. Could it be
the body of Harold Breedlove, a ranching heir who went missing 11 years
before, days after the 30th birthday that earned him the family trust
fund? Though retired, Leaphorn returns to the case he once investigated,
assisting the newly promoted Chee. Before they discover the clue
Leaphorn missed years before, the Breedloves' guide is wounded by a
sniper. The Breedlove family's interest in the old case -- their
attorney John McDermott (former mentor and lover of Chee's fiancée,
Janet Pete) hires Leaphorn to investigate Breedlove's death --
confirming the duo's suspicion that the case is not dead yet. The First Eagle, 1998 Chee
Anderson Nez has died of the Black Death, but no one knows why or how.
Catherine Pollard, one of the scientists studying this newest outbreak,
finds herself the subject of Officer Benny Kinsman's unwanted advances.
When confronted, Kinsman takes off to nab a Hopi man who's poaching
eagles. Chee arrives as backup only to find a young Hopi standing over
Benny's mortally wounded body. Meanwhile, Leaphorn, now a consulting
detective to the wealthy, is investigating Catherine Pollard's
disappearance. Leaphorn and Chee come together again as they uncover the
secret of Yells Back Butte, plague fleas, and skinwalkers. Hunting Badger, 2000 Leaphorn & Chee In 1998 three heavily armed "survivalists" rob a Ute casino, killing the
head of security, wounding an off-duty Navajo police officer, and then
vanishing into canyon country. Inspired by actual events on the
Utah-Arizona border, the crime and bungled FBI manhunt recall Chee from
his vacation. When a rancher gives him the criminals' names, Leaphorn is
back in the saddle as well, and the two begin their own hunt for the
wanted men. While the FBI relies on helicopters and high-tech equipment
to name the wounded deputy sheriff a suspect, Chee and Leaphorn connect
the crime with the legendary exploits of a Ute hero-bandit.
The Wailing Wind, 2002 Leaphorn & Chee Rookie officer Bernadette Manuelito should have known the dead man
wasn't just another drunk. Leaphorn knows better. He comes out of
retirement to examine the shooting of Thomas Doherty, a murder which has
links to the old Golden Calf homicide. Two years before, Marvin McKay
tried to swindle Wiley Denton over a lost goldmine and was repaid with a
lethal bullet. Denton's wife, Linda, disappeared that same day. While
Denton was killing McKay, a group of teens lurking in an abandoned depot
nearby heard La Llorana, the mythical wailing woman, crying out in the
wind. Before Chee can cover Manuelito's tracks, she's begun an
investigation linking both murders and the disappearance to the spectral
wailing woman at Fort Wingate the Halloween night that Denton shot
McKay.

Date the Dish
by Rick Groleau
Blue-and-white Chinese porcelain, the type pulled from the South China Seas in the NOVA program "Sultan's Lost Treasure," has a long and fascinating history, going back at least to A.D. 1319, to the Yuan dynasty. With over 680 years' worth of artifacts produced by Chinese kilns, experts have a formidable task in dating these beautiful objects.
There are many clues that can help an expert—clues such as an artifact's motifs (images painted on its surface), its marks (writings on the piece), and the quality of its blue pigment.
The following feature puts you in the role of a porcelain expert. Can you correctly assess the age of a fine blue-and-white porcelain artifact?

Episodes White Smoke Timeline: The Papacy	April 26th, 2005
White Smoke
Timeline: The Papacy
1242
The first conclave is held.
1420
The papacy returns to Rome, after residing in Avignon, France since 1305.
1447 – 1513
During the Renaissance various popes (Nicholas V, Pius II, Sixtus IV, Innocent VIII, Julius II and Alexander VI to name a few) show great interest in the arts. The Vatican art collection grows immensely. 1475 – 1483
Giovanni de Dolci builds the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.
1508
Pope Julius II asks Michelangelo Buonarroti to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. He began in May and finished in October of 1512. 1860
The army of Victor Emmanuel II, King of Sardinia, seizes control of the approximately 17,000 square miles that constituted the Papal States. 1871
In May, by order of Italian law, the territory of the papacy is confined to the Vatican and Lateran palaces, as well as the villa of Castel Gandolfo. The popes unilaterally refuse to recognize this decree.
1929
In February the Lateran Treaty between the Vatican and the kingdom of Italy establishes the autonomy of the Vatican City.
1962
In October the first session of Ecumenical Council Vatican II is brought into being by John XXIII. The expressed purpose of this council is to discuss and address problems surrounding the modernization of the Roman Catholic Church. The eventual result is a significant decentralization of the church.
1978
On August 26, Cardinal Albino Luciani is selected to succeed Paul VI as Pope. Cardinal Luciani takes the name John Paul I, but 34 short days after his election, he dies of a heart attack. The reign of John Paul I is the shortest in 373 years. On October 16, 1978 Cardinal Karol Wojtyla is chosen to succeed John Paul I. He takes the name John Paul II and becomes the first Polish pope and the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century.
1981
On May 13, a Turkish terrorist shoots Pope John Paul II in St. Peter’s Square. This marks the first assassination attempt made against the pontiff in contemporary times.
1985
On June 3, the Vatican and Italy ratify a new version of the concordat (church/state treaty). The new agreement reaffirms the autonomy of Vatican City but puts an end to many privileges the Catholic Church had until then enjoyed in Italy, including its status as the official state religion.
2005
On April 2 Pope John Paul II died. His 26-year-long reign was the third longest in history. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected by the College of Cardinals on Tuesday, April 19th.
