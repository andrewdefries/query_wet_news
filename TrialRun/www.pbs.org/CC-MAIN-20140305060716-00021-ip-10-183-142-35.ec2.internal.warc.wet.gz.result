Whole Wheat Brioche Buns
Recipe courtesy of Fresh Tastes
Try this whole wheat brioche bun recipe for a versatile bread that makes a delicious burger bun, sandwich bread, or just a dinner bun. Food blogger Marc Matsumoto explains how to avoid a bitter taste to the wheat dough in a full post on the Fresh Tastes blog.
Yield: 4 giant buns, 6 medium buns, or 12 slider buns
Course: Appetizer, Side DishCuisine: FrenchOccasion: Christmas, Cookout, Easter, Picnic, ThanksgivingTheme: Cooking with Kids
Ingredients1/2 cup whole milk, warmed3 tablespoons honey2 1/2 teaspoons (7 grams / .25 ounces) dry active yeast1 cup (150 grams / 5.3 ounces) whole-wheat flour2 eggs room temperature, separated6 tablespoons (85 grams / 3 ounces) butter, melted but not hot1 ¼ cups (190 grams / 6.7 ounces) bread flourDirectionsAdd the warmed milk, and honey into the bowl of a stand mixer and stir to combine. Sprinkle the yeast onto the mixture and let the yeast rehydrate for a few minutes. Mix in the whole-wheat flour and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. This gets the yeast going and allows the bran in the whole wheat to rehydrate. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and butter together until smooth, and then add the whites and continue whisking until incorporated. Yolks are an emulsifier and mixing them in first helps the butter incorporate more evenly with the whites. Add the butter mixture and bread flour to the mixer bowl and stir everything together with a wooden spoon.Fit your mixer with the dough hook and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes). You may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise until it's doubled in size. Punch down the dough and then split the dough into 4, 6, or 12 evenly sized pieces. Dividing into 4 will get you 4 extra-large buns, dividing into 6 will get you 6 regular sized buns, 12 pieces will get you slider buns. If the dough was kneaded long enough you should not need to use any flour when handling the dough.Hold a piece of dough in both hands with your thumbs resting on top and your eight other fingers coming together at the bottom. Use your thumbs to stretch the dough over your fingers and tuck the stretched dough under and inside the bun. Repeat this a few times until you have a nice smooth dome on top. Gently place each bun on a parchment lined baking sheet leaving enough space between each one for them to double in size. Loosely cover the buns with an oiled sheet of plastic wrap and put the pan in a warm place, allowing the buns to rise until doubled in size. Set the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F (170 C).Sprinkle each bun with black sesame seeds and bake in the oven until the buns are golden brown (about 30 minutes).Remove from the oven and place the buns on a cooling rack to cool. Once cooled you can store them in a paper bag for up to a day, or a plastic bag if you need to keep them for longer. Tags: Bread Recipes

Conquistadors - Forum
Cortes and Mexico Would you have wanted to be a conquistador or an Aztec warrior? Reality Check. Author: ilegal Date: 11-27-00 10:32 Gary: History is always distorted. I am not sure what sources you draw information from. As primitive as the Aztecs were their cities were more spectacular at its time than any city in Europe. Look what Bernal Diaz del Castillo an actual Spanish explorer said when he witneesed the magnificent Tenochtitlan: All about us we saw cities and villages built in the water, their great towers and buildings of masonry rising out of it� When I beheld the scenes around me I thought within myself, this was the garden of the world. And of all the wonders I beheld that day, nothing now remains. All is overthrown and lost." � Bernal Diaz del Castillo, one of Cortes' men in The Conquest of New Spain. History can only be fair and just and based on factual information. There is no place for personal opinions or wrongly arbitrary opinions from scholars not based on facts. -Slavey is not something any culture can be proud of, Interestingly enough it was a greek phylosopher " Aristotle," who validated this idea for Europeans. So much for "individuality and human rights" and the basis of democracy the Greek have given us. We should all be ashamed for who our teachers have been. -Individuality is such an abused term in the United States, everything ends up in court. Look at the Election's for presidency chair for 2000. Such a joke, this democracy term is in America. African Amricans were not given the right to vote 'til the 60's when Martin Luther King fought for that right. Can I ask when women were given the rigt to vote in the USA. Let's be real. - The monarchy of Spain, England, an Japan. It still as primitive in the 21st Century as it was for the Aztecs. Look who implements in our lifetime. Advanced, fist world nations. LONG LIVE THE KING!! The Mesoamerican cultures, can be compare to the most advanced cultures in History like the Greeks: because they were very advanced astronomers, engineers, architects, mathematicians, and writers. I believe the Aztec calendar is writing. I don't know where you go the idea that the Aztecs did not have a form of writing. In addition, if you were to go to Palenque, Tikal, Copan, tenochtitlan. There are buildings that have all the history engraved in stone. We have number of archeologist deciphering the history directly from the building's writing. In addition, the concept of zero was introduced by the mesoamerican cultures. All the advanced algebra and mathemathics broke in principle and not longer practical with the introduction of zero. This was the "Eurpoean and Greek" math. I guess the Europeans were not as advanced as you think they were. In engineering, mathematics, and physics we use special math to deal with the concept of zero. A mathematician can develop a whole infrastructure of math working with the actual principle of zero. Let's remember that as our physical world shrinks to micro levels, physiscs has to develop and use all the samre framewrok of zero "in terms of approaching a limit to zero (-infinity, +Infinity) to be able to make sense of the "micro physical atomic forces and energy." After all, what would our modern culture be withouth binary math. Computers operate on this principle which is "0" and "1". On and off switching. I guess we do owe Mesoamerican cultures a great deal. Let's recognize that, honor it, and respect it. Back to Forum | Previous Message | Next Message

BRIEFING AND OPINION
PAUL GIGOT: Over the past two weeks, extraordinary events and extraordinary pictures in Ukraine -- hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, taking to the streets of Kiev and seen on television throughout the world. They were protesting what was clearly a crooked election, rigged to support the candidate backed by Russia. It was even said to include the poisoning of the opposition candidate, seen here before and after the alleged poisoning. Dan, these pictures really are amazing. They reminded me of the People Power revolution in the Philippines in 1986, what scenes we saw in Prague in 1989. What's at stake here in this show-down?
DAN HENNINGER: Well, I think this is the biggest democratic event since the fall of the Berlin Wall, quite frankly. It helps that, in this case, the whole world is watching. The whole world is watching in a way that it wasn't watching in Venezuela when Chavez stole that election.
PAUL GIGOT: Which was a shame.
DAN HENNINGER: Now, the question is, is it going to be carried through? Is the world going to support the Ukrainians out there in Independence Square through to the end of this? Because what's at stake is the rule of law in these emerging nations, the right of self-determination. And I think it has a direct connection to what's going to happen January 30th in Iraq. Are the people of Iraq going to get the same sort of global support that the Ukrainians are getting right now? And is George Bush going to make a choice between his friend Vladimir Putin at some point in a crunch time, and go with the Ukrainian people?
PAUL GIGOT: Let's talk about the world of Russia here, Claudia. Putin did endorse the party that stole the election, and then he embraced the results even before the existing president --
CLAUDIA ROSETT: He couldn't wait, exactly. PAUL GIGOT: -- endorsed it. What is he up to?
CLAUDIA ROSETT: He's busy reconstituting a more efficient version of the Soviet Union, unfortunately. He's rebuilding the Russian empire. That's what's going on here.
PAUL GIGOT: I mean, is he really going to risk it, however? I assume that's not going to be very popular in eastern Europe, or western Europe for that matter. Is he really going to risk his business relationships with the West and the rest to do that?
CLAUDIA ROSETT: This speaks exactly to Dan's point, that this is a crucial moment. He probably won't if we really stand up to this effort and say no. You have enough to do tending your own garden. Go back and build a nicer Russia, but don't -- that's why it's crucial.
BRET STEPHENS: And I'm very sorry to say that the lesson that Putin has taken from his first four years in office is that he really has nothing to fear from the West. I mean, President Bush -- we might look back and say President Bush's biggest mistake in office was to look into Vladimir Putin's eyes and see a trusting soul there. Well, it didn't turn out that way. Putin has been abusing America's trust in terms of our foreign policy. He's been oppositional over Iraq, over Iran, over North Korea. He's run an increasingly autocratic and repressive domestic policy in Russia. Now he's returning to this policy of the near abroad. And I think it's time the administration gets a lesson that this guy isn't a friend.
PAUL GIGOT: Wait a minute. If you talk to the administration they will tell you that we got missile defense out of them, and we're getting cooperation on terrorism, which is no small thing. Aren't those important issues right now?
BRET STEPHENS: Sure, they're important issues. And I think Putin has chosen areas where he feels he can cooperate because it's in his interests. But if you look at the broad record, it's not an encouraging record. And I think that this president, this American president, needs to send a very clear signal to Putin that this relationship is conditional and that he's watching very closely at Moscow and not at Kiev.
DAN HENNINGER: I want to connect it to Bret's last point about the United Nations, which is there's a moral issue of being able to recognize the good guys and the bad guys. And Ukrainians are a country that's trying to develop. This week the parliament withdrew support from the government. Then, at the end of the week, the Supreme Court -- which is apparently a serious institution -- decided that the election was fraudulent and they have to re-run the election. Not have an entirely new one, but re-run it, which is precisely the point here.
If you cannot support a country that is achieving these sorts of benchmarks and standards, then what is the point of trying to make a distinction between good and bad countries?
PAUL GIGOT: Historians and strategists, prominent people like Zbigniew Brzezinski, or Henry Kissinger, would argue that Russia cannot be an empire without the Ukraine. I think we have maps showing the extent to which Ukraine brings Russia closer to Europe. And you can see how important that is. Is this the reason that the Europeans in the West, and the Poles and others, have been speaking up fairly aggressively, and in a way they're not in Iraq or in Venezuela, against the attempt to steal this election in the Ukraine?
CLAUDIA ROSETT: Yes. And so much is in the balance here. There is a movement -- we saw it not long ago in another former Soviet Republic, Georgia, now an independent country. The Rose Revolution. The same people power in the streets. They threw out Shevardnadze, the old Soviet hanger-on, and brought in a young, forward-looking democrat. Ukraine is trying this, too.
You remember, when you mentioned the Philippines earlier, the movement that swept East Asia in the eighties where they began going democratic. We have a chance here. It's so important to stand up for it.
PAUL GIGOT: The possibility has been raised of partition, that the ethnic east in the Ukraine, which tends to be more Russian, would break off -- perhaps even by force -- from the West, which tends to be ethnic Ukrainian, about 80 percent of the country is ethnic Ukrainian. Is that a possibility here? Could we really see a civil war?
BRET STEPHENS: Well, it is a possibility, but I think it's easily overstated. And someone like Putin has to remember that what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Ukraine isn't the only country with secessionist possibilities within it. Russia has plenty of it, and we've been seeing it for the past decade in Chechnya. So I think it would be a very dangerous game. And I suspect Vladimir Putin is a smart enough operator to know this, to start pushing for secession of the Russian areas of Ukraine, because he will find that biting right back at him in other areas of Russia.
PAUL GIGOT: It seems the White House is trying very hard not to make this an east/west classic showdown. They're trying to give Putin some way of backing down without losing face. And shouldn't you give him that opportunity, and therefore maybe speak a little more softly than I hear the rest of you advocating? DAN HENNINGER: Well, that's what's sometimes known as a Chinese exit. Yeah, I think up to a point he should do that. The president is doing that for Putin right now. But there's going to be a point beyond which he's going to have to make a decision. If Putin doesn't take the opportunity, George Bush is going to have to step in on the side of the Ukrainian people, I think.
PAUL GIGOT: All right. I want to go around the table and get each of you to answer. Is the next president of the Ukraine going to be Putin's man or not? Claudia?
CLAUDIA ROSETT: Oh boy. I'm going to be on Yuschenko. That's good Viktor.
PAUL GIGOT: Dan?
DAN HENNINGER: With all the TV cameras on this day and night, yeah, I think the good guys are going to win this one.
BRET STEPHENS: Well, so long as the TV cameras remain, they're going to win.
PAUL GIGOT: Yeah, I think it's inevitable now that with the Supreme Court decision, that he's going to win what looks to be a new election. All right, thank you all very much.
