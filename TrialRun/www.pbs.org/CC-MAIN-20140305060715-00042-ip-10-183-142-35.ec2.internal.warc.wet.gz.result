Stim Wilcox Q&A
Stim Wilcox as seen on Spiders!: Song and Dance
Click on Stim's photo to read a brief bio.
Is it generally believed that this complex behavior of Portia spiders is completely programmed in their DNA? Charles
Portia's ability to do all its complex types of behavior, including the ability to solve problems and think on a limited basis, is genetically based, of course. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to do it. Since some of what they do is learn, flexibly, in some circumstances, it's clear that learning is genetically-based too. Most biologists would agree with that. Another way to put it is that they have the instinct to learn. It's rather amazing to see tiny Portia only a few days old doing the complex things adults do. So they have it all built in.
Do Portia spiders use any other techniques, or parts of their body besides their legs and mouth pieces to pluck the fibers of the web (besides what we saw on SAF)? Students at WAS
Portia uses its palps (in front of the mouth) -- and not the mouth parts, per se -- for plucking, drumming, etc., as well as its legs; but it also will shake the whole body in various ways. The complexity of Portia's signals comes not only using various parts of the body, but especially in how different parts are used in combinations. We've seen over 100 ways/combinations in which Portia can make signals.
How can you tell the difference between a male spider vs. a female spider? Adam
In spiders, all ADULT males have the tips of their palps expanded and/or elaborated, into organs which transfer sperm to the females. The palps of females don't have those expansions. Also, in many spiders the males are different in size, differently colored, differently shaped, etc. The palp expansions are the only sure way to tell in a species with which you're not familiar, if the sexes look mostly the same.
Why don't spiders get stuck or trapped in their own web? Katy
Spiders have evolved surface chemistry that enables them not to get stuck in their own webs. But most spiders do tend to get stuck in the webs of other species, especially if they're very different groups of spiders. One of the neat things about Portia is that Portia can move on the web of essentially any spider without getting stuck. When Portia jumps on her prey does she kill it with venom? If not what method does she use? Jen
Yes, Portia kills prey with venom, injected through its fangs. Portia's venom is a very broad-spectrum venom that kills essentially any spider or insect. Portia is also very resistant to being killed by the venom of other spiders. Both are obviously evolved features of Portia's biology.
Do Portia spiders ever get caught in webs? Greg
Portia can walk on any web we have ever put it upon. This is a very unusual ability, since most other spider groups tend to stick to webs made by different groups of spiders. Thus the surface chemistry of Portia is pretty special.
Is the silk we wear and use the same as spider silk? (asked by many viewers)
The silk we wear is made from the coccoons of a variety ofdomesticated moth species. The silk is spun by the caterpillars in circular fashion, so that the silk is literally unrolled off the coccoon, then woven into fabric. The silk is basically similar to the silk of spiders, however. To learn more about the silk fabric we wear, look up silk or silkworm in an encyclopedia.
Why are most spider webs formed in a circular shape instead of like a square or oval shape? Students at WAS
Actually, spiders make webs that are shaped anywhere from circular (orb) webs, to oval, to dome-shaped, to more or less flat sheets, to amorphous, multidirectional "space" webs, to little nets that are "cast" by the spider, to webs with towers or special things like that in them, to simple single strands. There are many sorts of webs/web shapes. A good source of web types and their evolution is a book written by William G. Eberhard.
I am wondering if you can buy Portia spiders, and if so where? (asked by several viewers)
There are no suppliers from whom you could buy Portia. Portia is an amazingly hard spider to find in the field if you don't have direct help from an experienced field person, though once you know they aren't very hard to locate. But there aren't very many Portia in any one area in the field, either.
The few researchers working on Portia in the laboratory treasure them highly, as they are difficult to raise and keep, for one main reason: they need a high proportion of other spiders as food. It's very time-intensive work to raise spiders as prey for Portia, as well as to hunt for prey spiders in the field. And in the winter, there aren't any spiders available in the field if you're in northern areas. So the researchers don't have Portia to sell. If we could buy Portia, we'd undoubtedly do that ourselves!
I thought the spiders program was very unique. I found it very interesting to see how smart a spider really is and to see the different prey-hunting techniques that Portia used. I wondered if there are any other spiders that use Portia's techniques? Albert
There are a number of other spider species which use Portia's techniques. Almost all the techniques Portia uses are used by at least one other species of spider. These include other jumping spiders besides Portia, as well as spiders in groups that are quite unrelated to Portia. The thing about Portia is that it does all the techniques any of the other species do, and it's fair to say it does the techniques as well as or better than the others.
In the United States, the common long-legged spiders found in most people's basements, Pholcus phalangiodes, is an aggressive mimic like Portia. It will leave its web and go hunting other spiders in their webs, and lure them closely with web-borne signals like Portia does. Also in our country there are other jumping spiders that will use the detour behavior Portia does - see a prey spider, then take a roundabout route to get to it. This takes planning ahead. I suspect most jumping spider species will do this.
Why do you think the Portia fimbriata developed its cunning techniques? (asked by several viewers)
We don't really know why Portia developed such cunning techniques. Our best guess is that Portia's excellent vision is involved, in that seeing prey at a distance means Portia can develop, through evolution, the ability to "think" about strategy and tactics before stalking the prey. This would put a premium on problem-solving ability and the ability to plan ahead, which Portia does very well.
What is the native habitat for the Portia? How long does it live? How many times a day does it eat? McCormick Middle School
Portia species live naturally from the northeastern part of Australia, in the rainforest, clear through the Malaysian etc island system to Sri Lanka. Other species are found in various parts of Africa. There are no Portia found in the Americas or Europe.
Portia will live about a year in the wild or in the laboratory, starting from the egg.
Portia can eat a spider of its own size about once every 2-3 days. If you give it lots of prey spiders, it will continue to eat them until it looks like it has a balloon for an abdomen. But then it won't be hungry for maybe up to a week. By and large, Portia and other jumping spiders eat much more food than many other spiders, probably because their hunting techniques (locating prey visually, then actively stalking them) use more energy than spiders that primarily sit on their webs.

Stock market news moved from the financial pages to the front pages as the number of first-time investors grew in the 1920s. Throughout 1929 daily papers reported that the future looked bright for investors — even after the devastating market crash in October.
Read newspaper excerpts from three New York papers: The World, The New York Herald Tribune, and The New York Times.
Wave of Buying Sweeps Over Market as Stocks Swing UpwardRadio Flashes High; General Motors and Steels SoarBy Laurence Stern
The atmosphere of doubt and caution which Wall Street in recent weeks has come to regard almost as habitual on Thursdays was swept away yesterday in a rush of buying…
Perhaps the market’s own strength weighed as heavily with speculative minds as the logic of the situation, since the tape is the one institution Wall Street does not argue with. At any rate, the market appeared entirely confident from the opening gong. It was a firm, almost buoyant, opening, many initial transactions involving large blocks at sizable price advances…
The advance was one of the most vigorous of the year, amounting to a net gain of 6.97 points in the Dow Jones “average” of thirty representative industrial issues…
— The World, March 15, 1929
Stocks Soar As Bank Aid Ends Fear of Money PanicBy W. A. Lyon
The stock market strode out from under the shadow of a panic in call money that so lately threatened, revived in all its old strength yesterday. Assured that the New York banks were ready with their boundless resources to prevent a money crisis, the public and the professional trader set out to repair the damage done to prices on Monday and the major part of Tuesday.
Stocks in the aggregate, though bucking a 15 per cent rate for loans, enjoyed the greatest advance they have known in a single day in the last two years. Not even the surging bull markets of the memorable year 1928 saw such a day of heavy buying.
— New York Herald Tribune, March 28, 1929
Banker Says Boom Will Run Into 1930
That at least a part of the great amount of money in the securities market may represent temporary employment of funds eventually finding their way into business uses, and that the prosperity of the present business cycle will probably not end in 1929, is the belief expressed by the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation in the quarterly review of the London house of Schroder.
— The World, March 30, 1929
Brokers to Open Offices on Ships
The New York Stock Exchange decided yesterday to put to sea. It gave two brokerage houses permission to establish offices with continuous stock quotations by radio, on trans-Atlantic ships. Within a few weeks business will be following the flags of three nations across the bounding main.
The American business man will be able to take a vacation in Europe without stopping for a single day his transactions at the centre of speculation…
What the psychological effect may be remains to be seen. Lady Luck always has been a favorite companion for diversions seekers at sea, a fact that has provided good incomes to many generations of traveling card players. Ships’ pools and the “horse races” on deck always have been popular. They may retain their popularity, but now they will be outclassed.
— The World, October 4, 1929
Public Liquidation Spurred by Bears, Hits Low MarketScare Orders From All Over Country Halt Ticker an Hour in Feverish DayBy Laurence Stern
With speculative nerves rubbed raw under the persistent hammering of bearish traders, a renewed wave of public liquidation swept over the stock market yesterday, depressing prices severely and hopelessly clogging the quotation ticker…
...To the majority of the market’s followers, who now must be counted in millions, the most significant aspect of the decline is that it has carried the average level of the list to a lower point than was reached on Oct. 4 in the sharp break that climaxed a month of gradual recession.
This raises a pertinent question, whether the bull movement of the last five years has definitely given way to a liquidating market…
— The World, October 20, 1929
Brokerage Houses Are Optimistic on the Recovery of StocksBrokers in Meeting Predict Recovery
A reassuring message to the stock market community went out last night over the country-wide network of private wires operated by brokerage houses. This was the result of a tacit agreement reached yesterday afternoon at a special meeting of the partners of about thirty-five of the largest wire houses of the New York Stock Exchange, at which the stock market situation was canvassed thoroughly…
...Much of the selling of the last few days, the brokers felt, was induced by hysteria. The views of all of the brokers present were heard, and none knew of anything disturbing to the general market situation…
— The New York Times, October 25, 1929
Brokers Believe Worst Is Over and Recommend Buying of Real Bargains
Wall Street in looking over the wreckage of the week, has come generally to the opinion that high grade investment issues can be bought now, without fear of a drastic decline. There is some difference of opinion as to whether not the correction must go further, but everyone realizes that the worst is over, and that there are bargains for those who are willing to buy conservatively and live through the immediate irregularity.
— New York Herald Tribune, October 27, 1929
Gigantic Bank Pool Pledged To Avert Disaster as Second Big Crash Stuns Wall StreetLargest Financial Powers in the City Meet After Day of Hysterical Liquidation Sinking Prices Below Thursday’sBy Laurence Stern
After the stock market had come crashing down again in a veritable deluge of forced and hysterical liquidation, word sped through the financial district last evening that the largest banks in the city were prepared to exert their organized power this morning to prevent further disaster.
Arrangements described as “fully adequate” were completed at a conference at the offices of J. P. Morgan & Co. at Broad and Wall Streets…
Although no formal statement was issued, it was the consensus of those at the meeting that the worst of the liquidation is over and that a natural demand for investment stocks now available on the bargain counter should go far toward an immediate restoration of trading stability.
— The World, October 29, 1929
Stocks Up in S
trong Rally; Rockefellers Big Buyers; Exchanges Close 2-1/2 DaysBy Ferdinand Lundberg
Revived by spontaneous investment buying and declarations of large extra cash dividends by leading companies, and free of the delirium that has recently gripped share owners, the stock market yesterday received a fresh start and scored a record comeback. Volume on the Stock Exchange totaled 10,727,320 shares, the third largest day on record.
The high spot of the day from a stock market viewpoint was the statement by John D. Rockefeller that there was no need to destroy values and that he and his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., had been heavy buyers of stocks for investment in the last few days, and would continue to buy at present prices…
— New York Herald Tribune, October 31, 1929
Very Prosperous Year Is ForecastGuenther Analyzes the Report of Mellon Covering 1929
That 1930 may be a very prosperous year, industrially and otherwise, without the peak conditions that made 1929 an exceptional year for business prosperity, is an observation made by Louis Guenther, publisher of the Financial World, in a statement based upon Secretary Mellon’s fiscal report…
“To grow too fast is often unhealthy because of the suddenness with which a readjustment must be met. By far and large the country would be better off were further progress made along more normal lines…
Fortunately, we have returned to a more normal mind in appraising prospects. We are not looking for the Midas touch on everything to which we turn. That makes us more satisfied with normal incomes and normal profit returns.”

Analysis - Can Fisa Keep Up With The Terrorism Threat? | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE | PBS
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), passed in 1978 after revelations of domestic surveillance abuses during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations, designated a secret court to approve warrants for domestic surveillance. Since 9/11, however, there's been criticism that FISA is not flexible enough to keep up with the terrorism threat. Some experts from FRONTLINE's report weigh in on the debate.
Related LinkThe Bush Administration's Proposed Revisions to FISA
This April 2007 Justice Department fact sheet outlines what the Bush administration considers "long overdue" changes to FISA.
James Baker
Counsel for intelligence policy, Justice Department (2001-present)
Read his full interview »
Has the FISA law, has the FISA court kept up with the times? Can it work in the 21st century?
In my opinion FISA works. It worked in the 20th century; it works today. Congress said when it enacted FISA in the legislative history, it said that no means of collection are barred by the statute. In other words, they wrote the statute to have the flexibility to allow us to collect any type of communications or information that meets the requirements of the statute. There's no type of collection that's prohibited by the statute. That's point number one.
I also think that FISA works in the 21st century because, as you know, the government recently filed applications with the FISA court regarding the terrorist surveillance program.
The president's [warrantless wiretapping] program.
Yes. So the FISA court approved those, and we think that the approval gives us the necessary speed and agility that we need today to fight the war on terror. ...
The third thing is FISA works because the information that you collect from FISA can be disseminated widely within the intelligence community, assuming that it meets the requirements of the statute and it can be used as evidence in a criminal case. So there is a certainty with respect to the legitimacy of the information that's collected with respect to FISA. ...
I think it's important to remember, for example, that the Fourth Amendment, one of the cornerstones of our liberty and of our Constitution, was written by people who had never seen a light bulb. So obviously lots of things have changed since the 18th century, and I don't believe the people are seriously debating whether the Fourth Amendment needs to be changed today. ...
Let me just break that down for a moment. We've talked to a lot of people in the intelligence community, and some of them will say, "FISA moves too slow; it's too cumbersome." You deal with it day in and day out. Does it move too slow? ... We respond to the needs and the requirements of the intelligence community on a day-to-day basis, and part of the challenge is to make sure that we have a robust interaction with the intelligence community so that we can prioritize our work effectively and efficiently according to what they need. Urgent cases, emergency cases, cases that meet the requirements of the statute go through the system extremely quickly.
Sometimes when folks are concerned about what's happening with the statute that's moving too slowly, that may be because they're viewing it from the perspective of their particular case, and their particular case may not be the higher-priority case for the intelligence community. We adjust our resources accordingly.
You say emergency cases can be handled rapidly. How fast is fast? There's a provision under FISA that allows the attorney general to approve an emergency surveillance or search without a court order for periods of up to 72 hours. The agencies know about this. We work with them on this all the time, and when they assess that they need to resort to that provision, they contact us right away. …
You've described a process that is agile, flexible, fast and capable of dealing with the modern communications challenge. Gen. [Michael] Hayden, former head of the NSA, said they had to do the [warrantless wiretapping] program independently because he needed speed and agility. How do you reconcile that?
Well, as the attorney general [Alberto Gonzalez] has said, we now have taken the terrorist surveillance program under FISA, so there's a FISA order now that has replaced the president's authorization. The assessment of the executive branch, the intelligence agencies, the Justice Department is that the new system provides us with the speed and agility that we need just as Gen. Hayden was describing.
However, the attorney general has also said that it took us some time to get there and that we'd been working on this now for a couple of years, even before there was the disclosure in the press about the program. The applications that we filed are innovative. They're also complex. It took us a while to figure out how we were going to do this type of collection under the existing FISA statute without having it amended, and so it was a challenge; it took us time. We had five years of experience with dealing with Al Qaeda. We had five years of building up the law before the FISA court, building up precedents, getting to where we needed to be to be able to file this application, have the court consider it and then have them approve it.
John Yoo
Deputy assistant attorney general, Office of Legal Counsel, Justice Department (2001-2003)
Read his full interview »
I think the biggest problem with FISA is that it's rooted in the mind-set of the law enforcement system: primarily, you need reasonable suspicion that someone is a terrorist; you really need to have information; you really need to have something that person did already that point[s] him out as a terrorist. That prevents the government from certain kinds of data mining or trying to search communications for key words, from trying to correlate key patterns of activity that may have a high probability of being linked to terrorist activity. But when you don't already have somebody's name, you already don't have it attached to somebody you think is a terrorist, then you need to be able to do that, to be able to predict and stop future terrorist attacks by people who may not already have committed a crime, may not already be known terrorists.
John Ashcroft
Attorney general (2001-2005)
Read his full interview »
The FISA court was never intended to be exclusive or all that could be done to defend the country in time of peril. It was, at its enactment, an effort to try and bring a way of handling circumstances that was safeguarded and that had the supervision of federal judges in the process. I think it succeeded at that.
Now, there were obvious deficits in the capacity of the FISA court to operate, and that related to technology, and the idea of the roving wiretap, again, is the best example of that. It needed to be updated; it was updated in the Patriot Act. There were other things that came as a result of the FISA court and its rulings, and other courts and their rulings, which divided the intelligence community from the law enforcement community, and they needed revision and renovation. ...
Gen. Hayden has said that the FISA court or the FISA process wasn't adaptable, wasn't flexible enough. [Do you agree?]
If people think the FISA court provided all of the authority that a president would ever have to defend the country, I think it's pretty clear that it's not adaptable enough; it's not flexible enough.
The FISA court [was] intended to be a court that would deal with foreign powers and agents of foreign powers. Now there are a variety of other potential threats to our nation's existence that from time to time may require other kinds of activity. That other kind of activity has been undertaken by presidents from the very beginning of the republic and certainly during my lifetime.
Peter Swire
Chief counsel for privacy, Executive Office of the President at the Office of Management and Budget (1999-2001)
Read his full interview »
There are people who argue that in today's communications world, you can't live under the old rules. FISA's broken; the old Anglo-Saxon principles don't work anymore. What's your response?
My response is in every generation the government wants to know everything about its citizens, and if you set up a secret police to listen to all the ordinary people, it's a bad way to go. ...
New world; mass communications; terrorists among us; homeland is the battleground; the president is commander in chief. None of that persuades you?
Let's look individually. Are there specific tailored problems? [Then] you fix it. But the president during the Civil War, during World War I, during World War -- in all the periods in history, presidents want more power. It's normal. It makes their life easier. They can achieve their goals better. But our American job back is to say, "Checks and balances." And that's what been lost in the last several years.
Michael Woods
Attorney, national security division, FBI (1999-2002)
Read his full interview »
FISA can't keep up with the technology of the modern era and can't keep up with the threat of the modern era. ... I'm just wondering from the standpoint of the FBI, is that true? ... I don't believe so, and here's why: There are really a very, very small group of people in the government who have significant practical experience using FISA. What I often tell people I'm teaching is there are a lot more people in the government that talk about FISA than ever come close enough to see how it actually operates. ...
The technology doesn't necessarily defeat FISA. It is certainly harder to work with it, but our criminal statutes were written in the same era. They are no closer to being up to date. If you are going to have a system of laws, you have to deal with a situation in which the law doesn't keep pace. The law is never going to keep pace with the technology. I think the only hope is to write the law in a way that is adaptable enough. And to me that was one of the strengths of FISA. You had the law, but you also had a court who could work with the individual case and try to accommodate it. …
FISA is a tool largely for targeted surveillance. It doesn't necessarily require that I have to know precisely the individual that I am targeting, but I have to be able to describe my target with some particularity. It is not a tool that is written for broad collection of information, because when it was written, and I think to some extent now, the general belief is that's not something we want to be doing inside the United States. ...
