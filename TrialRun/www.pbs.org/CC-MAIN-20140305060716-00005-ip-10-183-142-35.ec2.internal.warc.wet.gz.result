The committee’s temporary chairman Patrick Leahy cited some of the memorable Senate events that occurred in this room.SEN. PATRICK LEAHY: The hearings into the sinking of the Titanic were held here. The Army/McCarthy hearings, a number of hearings of Supreme Court nominations.SEN. ARLEN SPECTER: We haven’t been here since Justice Thomas and Judge Bork. This is a very famous room for major matters.KWAME HOLMAN: And Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter went on to surmise the selection of the room was a commentary on the importance of this hearing. Indeed, John Ashcroft’s nomination to be Attorney General has proven to be the most contentious cabinet pick since Senator John Tower’s bid to become Defense Secretary ultimately was rejected 12 years ago. Expecting a long day filled with tough questions, Ashcroft was offered a predictable one as the day began.SEN. ARLEN SPECTER: To the extent that you have any role in the selection of Supreme Court nominees, would you make a commitment not to employ a litmus test on the pro- choice/pro-life distinction?JOHN ASHCROFT: I have not had a substantial discussion with the President-elect of the United States about my role in terms of judicial selection. I know the Constitution allocates clearly the appointment authority to the President. I know that he has indicated that he would not have a litmus test. And I believe that, in my service to him, it would be important that I reflect that clear indication of his that no litmus test would exist.KWAME HOLMAN: The tougher questions came from committee Democrats.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Senator Ashcroft, I must tell you I am deeply puzzled by what I heard yesterday and what I hear today. I am one that believes that in political life, of which you have been part for 25 years, it’s very hard to change your stripes or change your spots. And I see a kind of metamorphosis going on, a mutation if you will, that somebody that has been really on the far right of many of the issues about which Senators have spoken today, or yesterday– civil rights, a woman’s right to choice, certainly guns– is now making a change. And, quite frankly, I don’t know what to believe.KWAME HOLMAN: California’s Dianne Feinstein tried to pin down Ashcroft on two of the issues most often raised by Ashcroft’s critics: Guns and abortion.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Each year more than 32,000 women become pregnant as a result of rape, and approximately 50% of these end in abortion. Given the circumstances surrounding any rape, and certainly a resulting pregnancy, can you tell us why you feel there is no need for a rape exception to a ban on abortion?JOHN ASHCROFT: Thank you for your question. I understand these are deeply held views of yours, and my opposition to the aborting of unborn children has been a deeply held position of mine. I think it is also fair to say that I know the difference between an enactment role and an enforcement role. My involvement in legislation has, very frankly, in recognition of the law, centered in… in real terms on trying to do things like get parental consent and other things like that. Those are the kinds of things, which I have focused on, the ban on partial-birth abortion. But I will enforce the law, fairly and aggressively, firmly. I know the difference between the debate over enacting the law and the responsibility of enforcing the law, and that’s been clear in my record as a public servant.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Will you maintain the Department of Justice’s task force on violence against health care providers, and give it the resources it needs to continue?JOHN ASHCROFT: I will… The task… There have been, I think, three different task forces in this respect. I will maintain such task forces and provide them with the kind of resources that they need in order to make sure that we don’t impair the constitutional right of women to access reproductive health services.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Will you, 100%, investigate and prosecute activities that block the entrances to facilities where abortions are performed, even if the conduct is nonviolent?JOHN ASHCROFT: If the conduct of anyone violates the law regarding the access of women to reproductive health services, I will enforce the law vigorously. I will investigate the alleged violations thoroughly. I will direct U.S. Attorneys to devote resources to that on a priority basis.KWAME HOLMAN: Feinstein then turned to the gun issue.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: If you become Attorney General, will you maintain the Justice Department position in support of the assault weapons ban?JOHN ASHCROFT: Yes.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Will you support its reauthorization when it’s sunsets in 2004?JOHN ASHCROFT: It is my understanding that the President-elect of the United States has indicated his clear support for extending the assault weapon ban, and I would be pleased to move forward with that position, and to support that as a policy of this President, and as a policy of the Justice Department.KWAME HOLMAN: It was Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin who raised the issue of Ronnie White. He is the Missouri Supreme Court Justice, an African-American, whose nomination to a federal court was rejected by Senate Republicans in 1999. John Ashcroft led the fight against Ronnie White.SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: I’m troubled. I’m troubled by what I think is a mischaracterization of Ronnie White’s background, his temperament, his judicial training, his experience on the bench. When you spoke against Ronnie White on the floor of the United States Senate, you suggested that had he was pro-criminal. Well, I might suggest to you that the facts tell us otherwise. In 59 death penalty appeals, which Judge White reviewed while on the Missouri Supreme Court, he voted to uphold the death sentence in 41 cases, 70% of the time. The record also reflects that Judge White voted with the majority 53 times, 90% on the death cases before the Missouri Supreme Court. His decisions were affirmed 70% of the time, significantly better record than his predecessor who was affirmed 55% of the time, a gentleman whom you appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court. I find it interesting that this man, who was so important in the history of Missouri, had such an extraordinary background as an attorney, legislator, and a jurist, somehow became the focus of your attention and your decision to defeat him. Senator Ashcroft, did you treat Ronnie White fairly?JOHN ASHCROFT: Senator Durbin, I believe that I acted properly in carrying out my duties as a member of the committee and as a member of the Senate in relation to Judge Ronnie White. Not a single Republican voted for Judge White because of a substantial number of law enforcement organizations that opposed his nomination.SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: How many?JOHN ASHCROFT: Well, I know that the National Sheriff’s Association did.SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: The Missouri Federation is one group. And they represent, I think, 70 municipalities. The larger group, Missouri Chiefs of Police, including the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City, refused to accept your invitation to oppose him.JOHN ASHCROFT: As it relates to my own objections, I had a particular concern with his dissents in death penalty cases. Judge White has voted to give clearly guilty murderers a new trial by repeatedly ordering lower standards for proving various legal errors.SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: In which specific cases?JOHN ASHCROFT: Well, let me begin to address a case.KWAME HOLMAN: Ashcroft detailed the case of James Johnson, who was convicted of killing the wife of a sheriff and three law enforcement officers.JOHN ASHCROFT: And the defendant in the case had pleaded– not had pled, but had confessed completely to the crime in a statement that alleged no difficulties or no problems. So that when the case finally was litigated, it was clear that there was no question about whether or not he conducted himself in a way which was somehow excusable.SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: Senator, didn’t the dissent from Judge White come down to the question of the competency of his counsel? And didn’t Judge White say expressly in the decision that if he is guilty, than frankly he should face the death penalty? There was no question about it. The man was clearly lacking in skill in preparing the defense, and that is the only point made by Judge White?JOHN ASHCROFT: Well, I think that being the only point, it’s an inadequate point to overturn a guilty murder.SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: So the competency of counsel in a death penalty case you don’t believe is grounds for overturning?JOHN ASHCROFT: It’s part of the necessary grounds, Senator, but I believe mere incompetence of counsel without showing any evidence against the defendant does not mean that case should be overturned.KWAME HOLMAN: But Delaware Democrat Joseph Biden then drew a comparison between Ronnie White’s decision and a decision by now-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN: I mean, Scalia said the same things your old buddy did — to illustrate the point, he voted on a case to overturn the death penalty that had been imposed on a disgruntled ex-employee of a married couple; the defendant entered the couple’s home, shot the wife twice with a shotgun, and then shot and killed the husband, then when he realized the wife was still alive, he slit her throat and stabbed her twice with a hunting knife. In the second case, he wrote an opinion reversing the death penalty that he had imposed on a defendant who had raped and strangled a 13-year-old girl. Should Scalia not be on that court? What people are looking for is balance. So I would have less trouble with Ronnie White if you had gone to the floor when this decision was made and say, you know, I’m really disappointed in Scalia; he was one of my heroes. I just want you to understand why people are suspect. People are suspect not because they believe, at least to the best of my knowledge, because they believe you are a racist; they don’t believe that. I don’t believe that.JOHN ASHCROFT: I will enforce the law. I reject racism. I will reach out to people, all people, and enforce all of the law, and I respect this panel’s and this committee’s dedication. And I don’t have an argument.KWAME HOLMAN: As the Ashcroft hearings continue, Ronnie White is scheduled to appear tomorrow.

The most famous athlete of his time, his stunning triumph at the 1936 Olympic Games captivated the world even as it infuriated the Nazis. Despite the racial slurs he endured, Jesse Owens' grace and athleticism rallied crowds across the globe. But when the four-time Olympic gold medalist returned home, he could not even ride in the front of a bus. The story of the 22-year-old son of a sharecropper who triumphed over adversity to become a hero and world champion, Jesse Owens is also about the elusive, fleeting quality of fame and the way Americans idolize athletes when they suit our purpose, and forget them once they don't.

Evolution: Library: Double Immunity
Double Immunity
Dr. Stephen O'Brien's work with HIV led to a discovery that could one day help scientists treat or prevent HIV infection: People from some European populations carry a genetic mutation that prevents HIV from entering their white blood cells. O'Brien hypothesizes that this mutation, dating back 700 years, may have been a selective advantage during the bubonic plague, as it is today, with the onslaught of HIV. From Evolution: "Evolutionary Arms Race."

Backgrounder
Double Immunity:
The genetic scripts written in DNA code constantly undergo changes, or mutations. At times, these mistakes in a gene's message can be harmful; often, they have no significant effect. Occasionally, though, a mutation confers a survival advantage in the face of an environmental change. Most of the non-carriers of the mutation die, and those with the mutation are able to reproduce. With that powerful evolutionary selection force, the gene can become common in a population.
Recently, scientists were astonished to find that some individuals did not become infected with HIV, even after repeated exposure to the deadly virus. For some reason, they were immune. A long and difficult scientific search, using blood samples from hundreds of HIV-resistant patients, finally teased out the genetic explanation. Resistant individuals had in their cells two copies of a mutation that disrupted the entryway through which HIV viruses entered white blood cells. People who inherited just one copy of the change could become infected, but their disease progressed more slowly.
With this being such a recent epidemic, where did peoples' immunity come from? Another puzzle was the way this resistance is distributed throughout the world. In some Northern European populations it is relatively common. In Southern Europeans it is more rare, and it is almost entirely absent in Africans, Asians, and Native Americans. Logically, the mutation must have occurred in the past, acting as a defense against a different, previous epidemic caused -- like the AIDS epidemic -- by a pathogen that also targeted white blood cells.
Reading a chronological history, biologists traced the HIV-resistance gene mutation back about 700 years. That was the time at which the Black Death -- bubonic plague -- swept like a deadly scythe through Europe, killing one-third of the population. Then, as now, there were individuals who survived the lethal organism, perhaps because it could not enter their white blood cells. The areas that were hardest hit by the Black Plague match those where the gene for HIV resistance is the most common today.
At present, scientists are trying to infect such resistant cells with bubonic plague bacteria to test the hypothesis that the mutation in the CCR-5 receptor gene could have thwarted the plague in the Middle Ages, as it does HIV today. If it turns out that this mutation does protect against the plague, this coincidence will be yet another illustration of what scientists are finding over and over in the human genome: Nature's past successes often remain part of our genetic toolbox.

Young and Restless in China
FEATURED LESSON PLAN: Pushing And Pulling Migrant Workers In China
Lesson Objectives:
Students will:
Understand the "push" and "pull" factors behind China's internal migration
Evaluate the impact of 150-200 million migrant workers on modern China
Examine a migrant worker's dilemma and role play on her behalf
Materials Needed:
Internet access http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/youngchina/
Internet access or class copies of Migrants Are China's "Factories Without Smoke" http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/01/china.migrants/index.html (Note: The print option is 1.5 pages.)
Class copies of Student Handout Clearing The Smoke: Understanding China's Internal Migrations (Note: Two pages.)
Time Needed: Approx. 10-15 minutes - Images Without Sound
Approx. 20-30 minutes - "Factories Without Smoke"
Approx. 40-60 minutes - Should I Stay Or Should I Go?
Procedure: Step 1: Opening the Lesson - Images Without Sound
This activity can be conducted as a pre-viewing activity/discussion or in lieu of or in addition to watching the entire documentary.
Ask the students how they would visualize young people (people in their 20s and 30s) in China. Jot down their comments on the chalkboard.
Play the opening scene of Young & Restless in China with NO VOLUME (up until 4:02, Lu Dong jogging).
Have students jot down elements from this short clip that could be familiar to them. If time permits, play the clip a second time to allow students to complete this exercise. Pose the following questions:
What images can be just as easily viewed in students' home communities as they are depicted in this documentary set in China? Have students defend their observations.
What are distinctly "Chinese" elements in this short clip? Again, have students defend their observations.
Have students decide whether this clip is more foreign or familiar to them.
Have students propose what they think this documentary will be about.
Assessment
Review students' responses for clarity.
Step 2: "Factories Without Smoke"
Distribute copies of the CNN article Migrants Are China's "Factories Without Smoke" or have students access the article online. (This article can also be assigned for homework reading the previous night.)
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/01/china.migrants/index.html
Distribute copies of the Student Handout: Clearing The Smoke: Understanding China's Internal Migrations. In groups of three, students will discuss the significant details of the article as they collaborate on completing the handout.
After the students have finished their discussions and worked on the handout, reconvene as a large group. Invite students to share their responses to the final question below. Encourage students to support or challenge their classmates' views.
In the final analysis, are the 150-200 million internal migrants a positive or negative phenomenon for:
China? the workers themselves? Defend your position.
Invite students to draw connections between China's current experience and other moments in global or United States history where societies have experienced similar waves of internal migration. Challenge students to reevaluate their critique based on historical precedents.
Methods for assessment
Quality of student participation during class and group discussions
Completion of Clearing The Smoke: Understanding China's Internal Migrations Step 3: Should I Stay Or Should I Go?
Students will watch a clip from Young & Restless in China. The relevant segment is Chapter 2, from 1:21 to 5:57, beginning with scenes of present-day Tiananmen Square and finishing with Wei Zhanyan bringing clothes in from drying outside.
After the clip finishes, lead the class through a discussion as the students reflect on what they watched. This can either be conducted in a large group or the following questions can be distributed for small group discussions.
What do you think are important parts of Wei Zhanyan's biography to help understand her character? Why are these factors relevant?
What does Wei Zhanyan like about her new life?
What do you think bothers Wei Zhanyan about her new life?
Students will watch one more clip from Young & Restless in China. The relevant segment runs from the beginning of Chaper 5 to 6:04.
Again, conduct a discussion, using the following questions.
What are some notable differences between Wei Zhanyan's life in Beijing and her life in her father's home?
Consider each person's concerns about getting married or breaking off the engagement:
Wei Zhanyan
Wei Zhanyan's father and brother
Wei Zhanyan's fiance
What was it like watching the scene between Wei Zhanyan and her fiance? How did it make you, the viewer, feel?
In groups of two or three, students will develop a dialogue between Wei Zhanyan and her father and brother where they discuss and debate whether she should remain engaged and get married or break off the engagement. Students can write a series of letters (a minimum of four representing two exchanges) Students can write a scene (a minimum of three pages)
Students must try to represent the characters of Wei Zhanyan, her father and her brother as they were depicted in the documentary. Students can also pursue an additional option of developing a dialogue between Wei Zhanyan and her fiance. Encourage students to consider the economic and social implications of Wei Zhanyan both returning to her hometown and getting married and breaking off the engagement and staying in Beijing.
If time permits, invite a few groups to perform their scenes or read their letters. Hold a brief discussion about what were the compelling issues they considered when depicting Wei Zhanyan and her family's views on the issue of marriage and duty.
DO NOT REVEAL THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION UNTIL THE END OF THE LESSON: At the conclusion of the activity share with the students that with her father's eventual blessing, Wei Zhan broke off her engagement. She also met another migrant worker in Beijing and at the time of the documentary's taping, they were pursuing a romantic relationship. Hold an informal debate about whether breaking off the engagement was the right decision for her to make. Teacher Center Home

about shop Hamlet with David Tennant
To be, or not to be: that is the question. David Tennant meets fellow actors who’ve taken on Hamlet and compares notes on how to play a character that’s been played, probably, a million different ways. An acclaimed Hamlet in a recent Royal Shakespeare Company production, Tennant looks into the text about the doomed Danish Prince alongside the actors Jude Law, Simon Russell Beale and Ben Whishaw. This is a play made of historical sources and religious wars, existential questions, the meaning of life and death, and the idea that ghosts are real and speak. Tennant also finds that many actors who’ve played Hamlet share a common experience: deeply and profoundly personal, life changing. Follow link for Teacher Viewing Guide

Hamlet isn’t one of my favorite plays. Sure I love certain passages, but I just don’t get why everyone loves Hamlet. I appreciated the perspectives presented. I’m hoping there will be more of these episodes…King Lear and Richard III as well as looking at some of the comedies individually would be terrific. Thanks for an amazing program that I’m sad to see come to an end.
