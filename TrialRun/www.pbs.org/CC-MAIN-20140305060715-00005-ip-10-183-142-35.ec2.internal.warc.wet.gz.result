Condition Black
Introduction
NATURE’s Condition Black reveals how giant-wave surfers from around the world couldn’t walk away from the largest waves ever recorded.
On January 28, 1998, a monster weather system slammed into Oahu’s north shore. The Coast Guard called a Condition Black — all access to the water denied. It was every surfer’s dream and nightmare combined, playing and replaying on a seemingly endless loop, as colossal waves up to 40 feet high surged over the beaches of Oahu in a monstrous, unstoppable procession. The stunning footage, some recorded on IMAX film, the stories of the surfers, and the storm itself form the breathtaking core of Condition Black.
The surfers had a few days’ notice because a fierce storm forming off the coast of Japan was forecast to move eastward and toss huge waves ahead of it toward the Hawaiian Islands. Quickly, a buzz electrified the worldwide surfing network. It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the Eddie Aikau Memorial big-wave surfing competition, an event held on an ad hoc basis, when conditions warrant it, in honor of a local lifeguard who lost his life trying to rescue an endangered canoeing team in rough waters. But instead of the ideal, the surfers were confronted with the extreme. A combination of natural forces had intensified the effects of the storm, producing conditions that even the most experienced surfers had never seen before.

Come on, folks, break out with the full video…it’s not like I wouldn’t consider buying it anyway so I can see it in high resolution…I’m jonesing for the big wave video because I missed the show when it aired, but I caught the preview…so break out with the full video so I can watch it online and recommend it to my friends. When I get a little extra cash I promise to buy it from the Nature store, OK? Thanks for having a nicely organized database that responds well to obscure searches, though, because I couldn’t remember the title for the life of me…so I entered IMAX+filmed because I remembered that from the preview, and voila! So kudos for your search engine, and, uh….break out with the video!

i got to agree with everybody. when condition black first aired it was great then i came to the website to order the video there was nothing but a couple of clips… now there is absolutely nothing to see on the website, and i still want to buy the episode…it is an intense episode and very well documented. i just think you guys should be very well informative on the website like you were on the show. keep up the good work.

Nice article, Kyle. I’d be interested to see a follow-up at some point outlining some of the “tweaks” that might be considered in a bodybuilding program, maybe in sample training days actual or hypothetical…as well as looking at variables like stance, depth, how close to failure, how long to cycle them… I love box squats and have been curious to see an article on this specific subject for some time.
