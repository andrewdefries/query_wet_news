College Media Year in Review: 9/11 Anniversary, Paterno, RGIII, Sex & Satire
By Dan Reimold
Tweet
As student journalists across the country gear up for another academic year, it’s worth looking at the most impressive feats of the last year in college media.
Over the past academic year, student news teams put together a number of editions — in advance and spur-of-the-moment on deadline — geared toward remembering or highlighting major anniversaries, athletic achievements, campus icons, big events, and even s-e-x.
They appeared as full-blown print issues, pullout sections, digital-only PDFs, digital-print hybrids, and temporary special websites.
Below is a sampling of the most high-profile, controversial, editorially impressive, and aesthetically innovative 2011-2012 student press special editions. They are listed in order of their publication or posting, beginning last fall and stretching to late June.
9/11 10th Anniversary Issues
Near the start of fall semester, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, many student newspapers published special editions or sections. The papers used the milestone as motivation for a look at how the country and their campuses have changed. They also provided glimpses into the lives of current students, who comprise what is being called the 9/11 Generation.
As Indiana Daily Student editor-in-chief MaryJane Slaby wrote to readers on the front page of the first of two related IDS special issues, “We are Generation 9/11. For the last 10 years, 9/11 has shaped our lives and the world around us. Most students on campus have lived half or more of their lives since that day in 2001 and barely remember life and world events before it.”
Iowa State Daily Football Edition
Last November, the Iowa State University Cyclones staged a double-overtime, come-from-behind win against the then-undefeated, second-ranked Oklahoma State Cowboys. The historic victory included a narrowly missed field goal, a batted-intercepted OT pass, a calm-cool-collected redshirt freshman QB, fans storming the field and singing “Sweet Caroline” — and a special digital edition of The Iowa State Daily, ISU’s student newspaper.
As the paper’s editorial adviser, Mark Witherspoon, recounted in a post-game message on a popular college media advisers’ list-serv, roughly 20 staffers gathered to create the seven-page PDF “football edition.” As he wrote, “The game was over about 11:30, they filled the newsroom by midnight, and worked until at least 5 or 6 a.m. … to get the special edition out. It’s filled with wonderful photos, wonderful stories, an editorial eating crow on the sports guys’ wrong predictions, photo blogs, and digital highlights of the game.”
Daily O’Collegian Honor the Four Issue
Late last November, The Daily O’Collegian at Oklahoma State University responded to a sudden campus calamity with a touching 10-page special issue. Articles, a poem, and a photo tribute focused on various details and reactions to a plane crash that killed the head and assistant coach of the women’s basketball team — along with an OSU alumnus and his wife.
In the issue, the O’Colly also reported on the tragedy through the prism of a similar one that affected OSU a bit more than a decade ago: a plane crash that killed 10 members of the Cowboys community. The memorial rallying cry for that event: Remember the Ten. The commemorative declaration this time around: Honor the Four.
Daily Orange Fine Mess Edition
Over this past Thanksgiving break, Daily Orange staff at Syracuse University quickly pulled together a special edition focused on a sex abuse scandal involving its men’s basketball second-in-command, Bernie Fine. The eight-page issue detailed the allegations, the circumstances surrounding Fine’s sudden firing, student, player, and alumni reactions, and the inevitable comparisons to the Jerry Sandusky scandal at Penn State University.
A front-page editor’s note shared, “The Daily Orange publication calendar did not include a paper for the Monday after Fall Break, but because of the developing story about Bernie Fine … the editors at the D.O. felt it was important to have one. No advertisements appear in the paper to focus on content.”
Collegiate Times At a Loss Issue
In early December 2011, a midday shooting and campus lockdown at Virginia Tech University brought back memories of the horrific 2007 shootings that killed 33 people. During that episode, The Collegiate Times, VT’s student newspaper, provided tireless, innovative coverage unmatched by the outside media hordes that descended upon Blacksburg, Va.
Nearly five years later, on a late-semester Thursday, the CT again stepped up. As rumors and reports circulated about a fatal shooting and a gunman on the loose, staff turned to Twitter to tell the world what they were seeing and hearing and the trusted information they were receiving. They also interacted in real-time with students and other observers.
The next day, the paper published a much-lauded special print edition. As the edition’s lead story confirmed, “Yet again, Tech is shaken. Two lives are lost. And although life will go on for Tech students all too soon, it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the heartache this campus has endured. It is worth taking a moment to think about how we move forward.”
Baylor Lariat Heisman Issue
Also in December, The Baylor Lariat, the student newspaper at Baylor University, produced a special “Heisman Issue” to commemorate the selection of Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III as the recipient of college football’s highest honor.
The four-page edition included highlights from RGIII’s historic season, reactions from Baylor students and alumni, and a glimpse at the Heisman voting results broken down by geographic region. As one of the three standout quotes featured prominently on the front page related, “This is a forever kind of moment.”
Crimson White Championship Issue
In January, The Crimson White published a special 20-page edition to commemorate the University of Alabama’s historic 14th national college football championship. The standout write-up in the issue: “Zero Hesitation,” a rundown of how little outsiders had believed in the Tide a few months before the title run and how big the team played when the moment mattered.
As the piece began, “Zero. This word now has a special meaning for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Many believed the Tide had zero chance to make the BCS National Championship game after its loss to LSU on Nov. 5. Those same people pointed to the number of touchdowns scored between the two teams in their last meeting. However, when the clock struck zero, the only zero that mattered for the Tide was the one beside LSU on the scoreboard as the Tide shut out the Tigers 21-0.”
Daily Collegian Paterno Edition
Near the start of spring semester, in the wake of Joe Paterno’s death, The Daily Collegian published a special commemorative edition honoring the longtime Penn State head football coach. Related pieces touched on Paterno’s upbringing and early coaching career, his devotion to family and charities, the reactions of his former players, and the scandal that overwhelmed his final days.
A number of the pieces were topped by quotes from Paterno. Among them: “If you don’t want to be the best, then obviously you shouldn’t be associated with Penn State football … To live the good life, we have to make sure that others have at least a decent life … With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.”
Pitt News Sex Issue
Timed for release on Valentine’s Day, the fourth-annual sex issue by The Pitt News dove with gusto into body issues, birth control, pornography, celibacy, first dates, and, as one staffer excitedly proclaimed, “lady boobs!” The overall perspective, embodied by a line in a featured column: “Human sexuality is as diverse as human beings.”
In a letter to readers, editor-in-chief Michael Macagnone wrote, “The horizontal tango, making love, doing the deed: There’s no doubt our society has many means of talking about — and around — intercourse. And for most of the year, that is what society focuses on: the act itself, leaving the vast majority of its effects and implications unstated. Today though, with the naked intent of Valentine’s Day in promoting Hallmark sales, last-minute flower purchases, and romantic gestures all around, we’re going to talk about sex.”
North by Northwestern Dance Marathon Site
The lone digital outlet on the list: North by Northwestern. In early March, in honor of Northwestern University’s uber-popular Dance Marathon, a 30-hour philanthropy party, the online news magazine created a special site. Updated in real-time throughout the event, it featured photos, videos, blog posts, tweets, crowdsourced responses from the student dancers, haiku poetry, and a tracking of one student’s heart rate while dancing and another student’s calorie intake.
As outgoing NBN top editor Nolan Feeny said, “DM provides us with an opportunity to do what we do best. We are able to be there the whole weekend and find ways to tell stories that we couldn’t necessarily do with a traditional news format. It also allows us to show off our personality and our voice. The Daily Northwestern is a great paper, but I don’t think they would be asking Dance Marathon students whether they would rather have sex or a shower four times that day.”
Daily Free Press April Fools’ Issue
In early April, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Free Press at Boston University was forced to resign following the publication of a print-only April Fools’ issue that received immense reader criticism.
Spoof stories in the issue, dubbed The Disney Free Press, discussed Cinderella’s alleged involvement in a prostitution ring, BU frat brothers slipping Alice in Wonderland LSD, and the dwarfs from Snow White participating in a group rape of a female BU student.
Critics condemned the content for perpetuating a campus rape culture and mocking victims of sexual assault. BU has been especially attuned to such issues due to recent campus events, including a high-profile scandal involving sexual assault charges brought against a pair of university hockey players.
In a letter posted to the Free Press website soon after the issue premiered, the newspaper’s board of directors wrote, “We cannot apologize sincerely enough to all those who were offended by the inexcusable editorial judgment exercised in Monday’s annual print-only April Fools’ Day issue of the Daily Free Press … Considering the events of this semester and the increasingly vocal, constructive climate of conversation about sexual assault and many other important issues on campus, much of the content of Monday’s issue was incredibly harmful, tasteless, and out of line.”
Daily Cardinal Anniversary Issue
In April, The Daily Cardinal at the University of Wisconsin-Madison celebrated its 120th birthday with a resplendent special issue reflecting on its past and predicting its future. As the paper confirmed, “Since the 1890s, the Daily Cardinal has been a lens through which Wisconsin students have seen their world … For the past 120 years, students have produced the Daily Cardinal through wars, protests, and tragedies.”
Among the issue’s highlights: a Q&A with an alum who edited the paper in the early 1940s (following an all-staff strike in the late 1930s over the firing of the executive editor for being Jewish); a full-page, two-story tribute to former staffer Anthony Shadid, who died earlier this year in Syria while reporting for The New York Times; and a piece from current executive editor Kayla Johnson headlined “The Next 120 Years.”
Crimson White Tornado Reflection
In late April, a year after “one of the deadliest, costliest, and most widespread tornado outbreaks ever to hit the United States” struck Tuscaloosa, The Crimson White at the University of Alabama put together a comprehensive multi-platform news package reflecting on the storm’s impact and the challenges CW staffers faced covering it.
The three-pronged effort: a temporary special homepage featuring content from a year before and the present, including 10 new web-only articles and a few multimedia projects; an ads-free commemorative print edition with more than 20 storm-focused features; and a 15-minute documentary video outlining the staffers’ natural disaster reporting experience. The doc’s title: “Harder Than We Thought.”
The print edition included individual spotlights on how different communities are coping with the long-term aftermath; reports on how other areas hit by tornadoes in recent years are coping with their recoveries; and a story mentioning that pieces of an art professor’s sculpture caught within the swirl of the tornado have been found as far away as Georgia.
University Press BOT Special Investigation
In May, The University Press at Florida Atlantic University unleashed a special issue that oozed investigative awesomeness and revealed some unsavory, ironic truths about those in power at the Palm Beach County public school.
The issue’s aim: providing the down-low on the FAU Board of Trustees, the 13-member body that holds ultimate sway over the university’s infrastructure, finances, and future. UP staffer Karla Bowsher unraveled “so many bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, liens, and lawsuits in our trustees’ pasts that I needed another researcher [James Shackelford] to get through it all — and an entire issue of the newspaper to cover it all.”
Ubyssey Return Yearbook
Also in May, The Ubyssey at the University of British Columbia published a commemorative yearbook for 76 Japanese-Canadian students who were forced off campus and held as “enemy aliens” during World War II. It provides a fascinating history about both the school and the affected students.
Page after page after page features people whose lives were forever altered by a decision made during a moment of “frantic military mobilization.” Timed to appear at a UBC ceremony presenting the former students — living and deceased — with honorary degrees, it was titled simply, “Return.”
Daily Emerald Revolution Site
The web address: future.dailyemerald.com. The one-word header atop the homepage: Revolution. And the tagline just beneath it: “The Oregon Daily Emerald, reinvented for the digital age.”
The student newspaper at the University of Oregon — best known for its five-day-a-week print edition — is morphing into a more wide-ranging, digital-first “modern college media company.” On a special site that went live in late May, publisher Ryan Frank and top editors outlined a number of major new initiatives that will be rolled out in full force this fall.
Among them: a print issue that will appear twice per week, with new size, design, and content specs; the creation of an in-house tech startup and a separate marketing and event services team; and a ramp-up in “real-time news, community engagement, photo galleries, and videos on the web and social media.”
As Frank shared in a MediaShift post soon after the site premiered, “We’re about to close the book on the Oregon Daily Emerald. After 92 years, the University of Oregon’s newspaper will end its run as a Monday-to-Friday operation in June. Yes, it’s the end of an era, and we’re sad about that. But it’s also the start of a new era, the digital one.”
Daily Collegian Sandusky Issues
In mid-June, a special issue of The Daily Collegian appeared on newsstands across PSU and State College, Pa., focused on the criminal trial of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. Due to the reduced summer publishing schedule, Collegian staffers were not planning to put out a print edition until month’s end.
In a note to readers, the paper’s editor-in-chief, Casey McDermott, wrote, “Call me old-fashioned, sure — but I stand by the idea that there are certain moments that deserve to be documented beyond narratives told in 140-character bursts or minute-by-minute updates alone. This is one of those moments … Until now, our coverage of the Jerry Sandusky trial since the end of the spring semester has been online-only. This has its advantages … [b]ut we also wanted to note the start of this trial — an event that’s been preceded by seven of the most pivotal months in university history — in a way that could serve as an all-in-one reference as the trial unfolds.”
Along with recounting various aspects of Sandusky’s first day in court, the issue featured a rundown of the main prosecution and defense arguments, individual glimpses at all the trial participants, a timeline of events, and pieces on the courtroom’s social media ban and the withholding of the identities of some of the alleged Sandusky victims who testified.
Soon after, at the trial’s conclusion, the paper published a separate special issue documenting the story behind — and the implications surrounding — the guilty verdict. In its front-page summation, the paper rightly hinted that the story is still undoubtedly far from over. As the piece stated, “Seven months since the first arrest, eight days of testimony, 10 stories of abuse, 21 hours of deliberation, and one verdict. What’s next?”

Obama; Getty ImagesThe legislation would create a government-sponsored health insurance plan to compete with private insurers.The committee was the first congressional panel to approve health reform legislation. The vote came a day after Democratic leaders in the House put forward a draft plan of their own, which would also create a government-sponsored public plan, and would be paid for partly by tax increases on the wealthy.“This progress should make us hopeful but it can’t make us complacent,” Obama said Wednesday of the action in the House and Senate, in a White House Rose Garden speech. “It should instead provide the urgency for both the House and the Senate to finish their critical work on health reform before the August recess.”Listen to the full speech here:The Senate Health Committee legislation passed 13-10, in a party-line vote.Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee, decried what he called the “partisan” bill, saying that it would increase the deficit and cut wages and jobs.But acting chair Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., told reporters that the bill reflected bipartisan contributions.“Every member of this committee has had a contribution,” Dodd said, according to Politico. He pointed out that nearly 170 of the 200 GOP amendments were included in the final bill.“Even though this wasn’t a bipartisan vote, it was a bipartisan effort [...]There are numerous contributions – not just technical ones – in the bill,” said Dodd, who is filling in for Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., the Health Committee chair who is battling brain cancer.The bill would require every American to obtain health insurance, and would provide subsidies for families making up to four times the poverty level — nearly $90,000 for a family of four.It would also require employers to provide insurance for their employees or pay an annual fee of $750, although companies with fewer than 25 employees would be exempt.The bill also includes some required changes to the insurance industry — mandating, for example, that insurance companies could not refuse to cover individuals based on pre-existing conditions.The bill’s next challenge will come when it must be merged with a bill from the Senate Finance Committee, which is charged with figuring out how changes to the health care system would be funded. That committee, chaired by Sen. Max Baucus, D.-Mont., has fallen behind schedule as it searches for solutions to perhaps the most thorny issue in health care reform — how to pay for it.But Dodd told reporters he remains confident that the Finance Committee will find a workable solution:“I’m confident Max Baucus will get a bill,” he said, according to Politico. “I have every confidence Max Baucus will get the job done.” SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERchristopher dodd HEALTH CARE REFORM help committee Obama public plan Rx for Reform senate ted kennedy Are you aware of our comment policy?Beginning October 24, 2012, PBS NewsHour will allow open commenting for all registered users.

Photo by Mike Fritz.RELATED LINKSSlide Show: Battle for the Black Hills RAPID CITY, S.D. | Pine Ridge Reservation stretches across some of the poorest counties in the United States. Plagued by an unemployment rate above 80 percent, arid land, few prospects for industry, abysmal health statistics and life-expectancy rates rivaling those of Haiti, it’s no wonder outsiders ask: Why do the nine tribes constituting the Great Sioux Nation, including those on Pine Ridge, staunchly refuse to accept $1.3 billion from the federal government?564522421124211Why the Sioux Are Refusing $1.3 BillionMembers of the Great Sioux Nation could pocket a large sum set aside by the government for taking the resource-rich Black Hills away from the tribes in 1877. But leaders say the sacred land was never, and still isn't, for sale.2011-08-24 19:48:00disabled2105026679ObabZdcEXh4trueThe refusal of the money pivots on a feud that dates back to the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed by Sioux tribes and Gen. William T. Sherman, that guaranteed the tribes “undisturbed use and occupation” of a swath of land that included the Black Hills, a resource-rich region of western South Dakota. But in 1877, one year after Gen. George Armstrong Custer’s infamous defeat at the hands of Crazy Horse at Little Bighorn and without the consent of “three-fourths of all adult male Indians” stipulated by the treaty, the government seized the Black Hills, along with their gold, and began profiting from the protected land.Driving from nearby Rapid City to the reservation on Pine Ridge, it’s easy to see why the tribes want to reclaim some of that unused land — and why it was parceled as it was. Unlike the barren stretch of land that encompasses the reservation, the Black Hills are green, resource-rich, and thick with the smell of Ponderosa trees. Stretching across western South Dakota to neighboring Wyoming, they’ve been a draw for tourists and investors alike. In addition to gold, timber and minerals have been extracted, reaping profits for people other than the Sioux.Fast forward to 1980. The Supreme Court agreed with the Sioux: The land, long since settled, had been taken from them wrongfully, and $102 million was set aside as compensation. The trust’s value continues to grow well beyond $1 billion, but the Sioux have never collected.One key problem: The tribes say the payment is invalid because the land was never for sale and accepting the funds would be tantamount to a sales transaction. Ross Swimmer, former special trustee for American Indians, said the trust fund remains untouched for one reason: “They didn’t want the money. They wanted the Black Hills.”“The Sioux tribes have always maintained that that confiscation was illegal and the tribes must have some of their ancestral lands returned to them, and they’ve maintained that position since 1877,” said Mario Gonzalez, general counsel for the Oglala Sioux Tribe, who has devoted much of his career to the issue.Battle for Black Hills - View Slide Show“It’s a tough, tough group up there. I’m amazed that they have been willing to sit on the money this long without taking the money,” Swimmer said.But it’s not the resources alone that have fueled their determination all these years — a key reason for their lingering stand is that “the Black Hills has always been a spiritual place for tribal nations,” said Lionel Bordeaux, president of Sinte Gleska University on the nearby Rosebud Reservation.“The Sioux Indians are very attached to their lands and particularly the Black Hills because that’s the spiritual center of the Sioux nation,” said Gonzalez. To this day, sacred sites and religious narratives often center around the Black Hills.“It really saddens me that we’ve got some tribal members that want to accept the money and they don’t realize the harm they’re going to do; they don’t really understand why we say the Black Hills are sacred,” said former Oglala Sioux Tribe President Theresa Two Bulls.Nonetheless, leaders say the effort to reclaim portions of the Black Hills is now both principled and pragmatic: they “understand that times have changed, that they cannot remove non-members of the tribe from these lands,” said Gonzalez, and are asking instead for some combination of federally owned, unused land and joint management or rental agreements. Excluded from the debate are landmarks like Mount Rushmore, Ellsworth Air Force Base and privately owned or residential land.“We know that people are utilizing the Black Hills for their daily living, and it’s never been our intention to remove anybody,” Bordeaux said. “We have to coexist. But we would like to have some type of a co-management plan for certain parts of the Black Hills.”Tribal leaders are quick to point out that not only does the $1.3 billion represent a fraction compared to the monetary value of gold, minerals and timber extracted from it, it is based on value at the time of the treaty, not the present. And further, if distributed on a per capita basis across nine tribes, the money would soon be gone with little permanent benefit to the recipients.“If you took the money, it would be [a] pittance. Our numbers are too big in terms of population, and the dollars would be expended in a hurry…in a week, two weeks’ time, you’re broke, and you don’t have anything,” said Bordeaux.Two Bulls agreed. “If we accept the money, then we have no more of the treaty obligations that the federal government has with us for taking our land, for taking our gold, all our resources out of the Black Hills … we’re poor now, we’ll be poorer then when that happens,” she said.Leaders must continue to convince younger generations to adopt their long view. Tim Giago, who was born on Pine Ridge Reservation and has spent three decades as a journalist covering the issue, worries about that trend. “I think younger people aren’t as attuned to it. There are many that are, but then again we’re losing a lot of people.”The issue has been revived in recent years by an offer by President Obama to meet with the tribes if they could come up with a unified proposal to settle the issue in Congress. The most prominent attempt to do so in recent decades was a failed bill introduced by former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, which would have returned some of the land. But in the years since, the issue has been largely dormant, and the money in Washington untouched. The administration’s offer has raised a glimmer of hope that the issue could finally be resolved, 130 years later.Toward that end, tribal council leaders have been holding a series of meetings to try to come up with an agreement to take to Washington. The Hasapa (or Black Hills) Reparations Alliance was formed to bring the Sioux tribes together to formulate a plan that could be presented to the Obama administration. A series of meetings are underway this summer and fall in an attempt to reach a unified position.Edward Charging Elk, a member of the Rosebud Tribe, has put together one such proposal for a bill that he says is “realistic and doable” that focuses on three elements: the return of 1.3 million acres of the Black Hills, relabeling the trust money as back rent and then agreeing on the terms of future rent for the resources from the land to the tune of roughly $7 million a year. He hopes that plan will provide a vehicle for a mutually acceptable solution.“I think the work of disunity is over now. It’s a matter of rolling your sleeves up, following a very simple plan that everybody understands, and getting it into Congress,” Charging Elk said.Two Bulls sees the clock ticking as tribes scattered across the Dakotas and Nebraska try to unify. “There’s jealousy, there’s misunderstanding — instead of compromising, instead of discussing it and coming up with a solution, they all want their own way and we’ve tried to explain to them that this is very important because we’re running out of time.”Giago has seen the “ebb and flow” of the conflict but says it is now at a critical juncture with President Obama nearing the end of his first term. “We have a very, very small window of opportunity to try to at least get a bill introduced, and I think we’re still too far away from that. I’m hoping they can pull it together and get a bill in, but it’s going to be a tight race.”And what if the latest round of negotiations doesn’t yield the long-awaited redress to the Black Hills land claim that the Sioux seek? Bordeaux takes the long view of the seemingly intractable fight over the Black Hills: “If it doesn’t happen, we’ve been here before, and we’ll just back up and regroup and go forward again.”“We won the battle against Custer,” he said. “But the war continues.”Tom LeGro contributed to this report.Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story misspelled Mario Gonzalez’s name.

PBS - Scientific American Frontiers:Wild Places:Science Hotline:Peter Raven
Peter Raven has served as Professor of Botany at Washington University and Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden since 1971. A champion of conservation and biodiversity, Raven has cultivated research and educational programs in Latin America, Africa and Asia, as well as North America.
The recipient of numerous prizes and awards, Raven is a member of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology and is the Chairman of the National Geographic Society's Committee for Research and Exploration. In February 2001, Raven will become President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is also a member of academies of science in other countries, including Argentina, China, India, Italy and Russia.
A co-editor of the Flora of China a joint Chinese-American effort to census all the plants of China Raven is a prolific author of both popular and peer-reviewed scientific literature. His works include Biology of Plants, the internationally best selling botany textbook, and Environment, a leading environmental science textbook.

2.22.01 Steve Swoveland asked:
I am an environmental regulator in Richmond Indiana, pop. 45,000, and have a BS in Biology. I live in a small community, pop. 2000. I see urban sprawl destroying more land and resources in our community every day.
A small wetland in a floodplain behind my house will be destroyed this spring for a golf driving range. I personally fought last summer to stop the driving range development by harassing the State and Army Corp of Engineers into looking into the matter. The town leaders are fighting me, the developers are continuing forward, and I can gather NO community support. I am at wits end, to the point that I am losing interest in my own regulatory job. Why beat myself up everyday trying to regulate industrial compliance when local, State, and Federal policies allow continuous destruction of our habitat? Any words of wisdom? Any suggestions? Care to buy a golf driving range? It would be a nice place for a wetland. Raven's response:
Everything you accomplish, every single victory, will make the town better for those who live there in the future. Keep the faith, and work on tangible projects, ones that you think you can win -- then those will serve as models for others, and draw together a set of like-minded volunteers who, like you, care. Some issues will not work out as you wish, but if you find specific ones and enlist help, you will find some success. Have you a local chapter of the sierra club? That might be a good place to begin -- or find another group that will help. State Sierra Club can probably help too. Good luck!
2.22.01 Robin Pendleton asked:
As an Interior Designer and volunteer at the Bronx Zoo, I am particularly concerned about the continued use of wood veneers from the rain forest. Do you believe that there is a method to responsibly use and replenish these species or should we use alternative materials. Thank you for your response.
Raven's response:
Yes, insist on sustainably-grown forest products; ask your suppliers, and ask them to prove their sources. There are many people interested in this issue, and you probably have a local store that emphasizes it. Home Depot, largest purchaser of wood in the world, attempts to use only sustainably-produced wood. But asking questions and buying preferentially are the methods of choice.
2.22.01 Gwyn Wahlmann asked:
I was shocked to see Peter Raven chosen to speak for environmentalists, for his philosophy hardly represents concern for biodiversity. Missouri Botanical Gardens rainforest research is conducted according to an "ark" mentality of collecting and cataloguing plant specimen before they are extinct and to heck with saving the rest of the ecosystem, its too late anyway. This fatalism hurts the efforts (and funding) of those who continue to work towards saving the biodiversity of ecosystems----not just the plants. You may note that Raven cited prospective economic value of unknown and newly-discovered plants twice in this interview, the integral importance of insects, reptiles, mammals, etc. not once. This corporate-friendly position is hardly surprising when one knows that Monsanto has sunk a great deal of funding into the Missouri Botanical Gardens and Raven is, in fact, married to a Monsanto employee. I'm sorry but raiding the rainforests for samples that may prove to have future economic value is hardly representative of a concern for biodiversity, or representative of a true environmentalist.
Raven's response:
Actually, that's not what we do at all. Many of our scientists work in countries around the world, where their primary goal is building local capacity so that people can deal with their own sustainability issues on their own terms. These efforts are especially strong in Madagascar, Tanzania, Vietnam, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, as well as Central America. Doesn't really have a thing to do with corporations, here or there... Just with people and conservation. We've just initiated a new Center for Conservation and Sustainable Development. Of course Monsanto supports the garden, as they do all other cultural institutions in St. Louis, as well as (for example) the American Museum in New York, the Field Museum, the Smithsonian, and so forth. Would you think better of them if they didn't support us? I was once married to a Monsanto employee, but now divorced; guilt by association (assuming Monsanto is proved guilty) is a peculiar concept for the 21st century! Send us your address and we'll be able to send you some more material on our programs, if you're interested. Sorry you got such an impression -- just not what we do at all. 2.22.01 Isabella Christensen asked:
I understand that there is research currently underway at the University of Louisville aimed at eventually being able to synthesize/duplicate the enzyme RuBisCo (Ribulose Bisphosphate) that is specific to green plants. I worry that, if they are successful, humans will give even less consideration and care to the conservation of the planet's plant-life. I am curious to know your thoughts about this...thanks!
Raven's response:
Plants are important in many ways other than photosynthesis. They are the backbone of all communities and ecosystems, protect soil and water, provide shelter for other organisms, food of diverse kinds (directly and indirectly), have a wide metabolic diversity that can be used for products of interest such as drugs, and are just plain beautiful, -- we like to have them in our lives. So even if in the very long term we can find substitutes for photosynthesis, we'll never find substitutes for plants!
2.22.01 Judith Smith asked:
Dear Mr. Raven, I was very interested to hear your comments to Alan Alda in the interview. As a 6th grade science teacher I try to teach students to appreciate the natural world. Is there one thing, simply put, that you think we should be teaching our students about what they can do to improve what we, as adults, have failed to do? Raven's response:
Getting involved in understanding the local environment seems clearly to be the best stimulus for primary-school students, so learning about the local woodlot, prairie, or park, and the organisms that make it up tends to involve them for a lifetime of concern. Then most of the things that they can do concern waste, being conservative about energy, water, and the other things that we use to support our lives. Lots of interest there, and lots that everyone can learn about and do. By using less -- less energy, water, all substances -- and by doing so wisely, we'll leave more room for everything else in the world, and for the natural beauty that surrounds and inspires us. Many books are available on saving during our everyday activities, and the involvement in nature around us is easy to achieve and endlessly satisfying.
2.22.01 David Di Gennaro asked:
Wouldn't a vegetarian diet be a simple and very effective way to reduce and, even, eliminate global destruction by humans? Thank you, Dr. Raven. Raven's response:
Yes, and for many people it is highly satisfactory. Stored energy in plants is reduced to about a tenth in the animals that consume the plants, so clearly ten times as much food is available for a vegetarian. But anyone who becomes a vegetarian or vegan should be even more careful that the rest of us about achieving a balanced diet.
2.22.01 Rose Ann Hambacker asked:
In your opinion what are the top environmental organizations to join? I am writing for my two sons currently in the Air Force. Also, for an older person like me. Thank you. Raven's response:
Investigate them and see which appeal to you personally, in terms of their activities and their political philosophy. There are organizations that will appeal to anyone interested in nature and the world. Among the major national ones are the Audubon society, the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, The Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, the National Resources Defense Council, Defenders of Wildlife, as well as many local organizations such as zoos and botanical gardens that pursue conservation objectives. But find one that satisfies you, and support it: that's the important thing! 2.22.01 Sue asked:
What can an ordinary citizen do to assist in preserving this planet?
Raven's response:
Be conservative in using energy and water; use less while maintaining a standard of life that you appreciate. Work to preserve the natural beauty and the wildlands, even modified, around your own community. And promote Internationalism and an understanding of the needs of people all around the world in your own family, and throughout the range of people and groups with whom you come into contact. Americans need to understand the world, and especially the poorer, tropical nations of the world in order to help build a sustainable planet for us all. 2.22.01 Jerome McDermott asked:
I am constantly reminded of my helplessness to assist in making this a better world every time I place my garbage canister at my curb. What can I do to minimize the harm we are causing to our world. I don't ask for all the junk mail! I don't demand three, sometimes four times the necessary packaging I end up with when I buy products! I feel ultimately helpless. Is there a web site your institution operates or a society that I might join? I am only "one", but I am very concerned at the destruction even I likely am causing. Thank you for your efforts in making all of us aware of the interactive nature of our world. I am beginning to believe that a butterfly flapping its wings in my backyard really does affect someone else's world thousands of miles away. Raven's response:
You are not helpless at all; Americans consume about a quarter of what the world produces, although we have only about one twentieth of the world's people. By limiting consumption here, we are making a real contribution to stability in the U.S. and throughout the world. Keep after it, and find new ways to live conservatively. Another important area will be promoting an understanding of peoples all over the world, by visiting them, and using this understanding as a basis for positive engagement with them. They need and deserve our support as we work together for a sustainable planet. 2.22.01 Steve Ziemak asked:
I recently read The Ecology of Commerce by Paul Hawken, and I was very moved by some of the ideas he presented. In particular, the idea of green fees, or taxes on natural resource use, seems to be a good way to encourage a national economy (especially that of the U.S.) to promote environmental sustainability through already established free-market mechanisms. How do you view green fees, and do you see them as being able to help preserve the environment?
Raven's response:
I agree entirely with the views expressed by Paul Hawken with his co-authors, and believe that these would be objectives towards which we can all logically work. Selling ourselves gasoline at about two-thirds of what we paid in 1945 (in constant dollars) and expecting it never to increase in price is a recipe for disaster.
