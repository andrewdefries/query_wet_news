PBS : Empires : Queen Victoria : History of a Realm : Engines of Change
George the Fourth eating.Dover PublishingAs a teenager, Princess Victoria -- aware, as was the English public, that she was heir to the throne of her childless uncle, William IV -- was taken by her mother, the Duchess of Kent, on a royal progress -- by carriage -- through the rain-drenched Midlands into North Wales. For Victoria, it was a horrifying introduction to the Britain that kept the elegant society of the great houses at which they would stay comfortable and prosperous. "The men, women, children, country and houses are all black...," she wrote in her diary. "The grass is quite blasted and black." A blast furnace the entourage passed in their carriages was "an extraordinary building flaming with fire," after which everything continued to be "black, engines flaming, coals, in abundance; everywhere, smoking and burning coal heaps, intermingled with wretched huts and carts and little ragged children." Yet despite the grim conditions, at every stopping place, enthusiastic crowds shouted greetings, lengthy addresses by local officials promised future devotion, choirs sang patriotic anthems, and salutes were fired by happy celebrants, unaware that such anticipations of his death made old King William more than unhappy. At the great country houses, the princess dined from gold plates and drank from gilt cups, unaware that the industrial progress she had witnessed had left her future subjects behind in an abject misery concealed by their loyalty.In February 1837, the year of her accession, she again saw the future. At Hersham in Surrey, on a visit to Claremont, the country home of her uncle, King Leopold of the Belgians, she encountered her first railway train, and "saw the steam carriage pass with surprising quickness, striking sparks as it flew along the railroad, enveloped in clouds of smoke & making a loud noise. It was a curious thing indeed!" The invention would transform Victoria's world and way of life.Before the industrial revolution. When Queen only a few months later, she remained protected by her advisers from traveling on such dangerous conveyances, but her husband, Prince Albert, whom she married in February 1840, was fascinated by technology and eager to set an example that the Crown had to change with the world. At his request, the Great Western Railway constructed a state carriage for the Queen, short (by modern standards) and ornate, with a symbolic crown on the roof, the interior suggesting a small but opulent parlor. On June 14, 1841, the Queen and Prince made their first journey in it, on the line from Slough, near Windsor, to Paddington Station in London. Victoria announced herself "quite charmed," but Albert worried that the locomotive's speed was dangerously excessive -- an amazing fifty miles an hour.For their planned trip to Scotland, the Court proceeded by carriages to Slough, then boarded a special train of engine, luggage tender, royal saloon, and two carriages for attendants and railway officials. Victoria had been concerned about the crumbling of embankments on which trackage had been laid, a not-uncommon experience during the growing pains of railways, but her prime minister, Lord Melbourne, dismissed such worries as the price of progress in a rainy climate.At Paddington they disembarked into carriages again, crossing London to the Thames at Woolwich, where they boarded the antiquated yacht Royal George. The long voyage to Scotland was unpleasant. The cumbersome sailing ship had to be towed by two steamers, the Queen's introduction to the age of waterborne steam. The uneven strain on the two ropes, combined with the North Sea swells, left the royal party severely seasick. Victoria and Albert refused to return from Scotland, which they had grown to love, on the heaving Royal George, embarking for London on the less-than-royal steamship Trident. A royal steam yacht would be ordered for future progresses by sea, and when rail lines were extended into Scotland, the couple altered their lifestyle by purchasing Balmoral, on the Tweed. The steam engine changed England forever. The new age of technology suggested to Albert in the later 1840s a grand world's fair to display the arts and manufactures of all nations, and he tirelessly promoted funds for its fulfilment. On May 1, 1851 the Great Exhibition opened at the Crystal Palace, an engineering marvel itself, on the southeastern edge of Hyde Park. A wonder of iron and glass, it was the first substantial prefabricated building, and housed a staggering sampling of the new developments in engineering, manufactures and the arts. Its impetus in fostering change would be enormous, and the setting, with light streaming through its 293,655 panes of glass, awesome. Six million visitors were recorded, equal to a third of the kingdom. Charlotte Bront� wrote to her father, "Whatever human industry has created, you will find there." It would be another thrust by the Crown into a modernity not necessarily greeted with enthusiasm by an upper class uninterested in forceful change, or almost any change. In 1847, Prince Albert had campaigned to be chancellor of Cambridge, and as he was opposed by traditionalists, it became a hard-fought struggle. When he succeeded, he dragged a university reluctant to reform the hidebound Oxbridge system on the German model, with science and engineering, into the dynamic nineteenth century.Two wars had already emphasized to Britain the importance of long-distance telegraphic communication-the Crimean War in 1853-54, and the Indian Mutiny in 1856-57. (The telegraph had become practical by 1845.) No royal impetus was needed. But at Albert's death in 1861, his influence on the Queen, when it came to the engines of progress, ceased. Her attitude toward five later inventions which transformed Britain made that apparent, as she was briefly and grudgingly hospitable to only three of them. In the later 1870s the typewriter began to revolutionize how people communicated on paper. The Queen would have nothing to do with it, and discouraged its use for Court functions. In January 1878 she did permit Alexander Graham Bell to demonstrate his telephone, which left her unimpressed: "It was faint." When commercial service began in London the next year, she was uninterested, and would never suffer a telephone in the living quarters in any of her residences. When Thomas Edison's phonograph was demonstrated, she had no use for it, but when it was explained to her that a border dispute with Ethiopia might be best handled with the backward King Menelik by sending him a queenly phonographic message, she spoke briefly but imperiously into a large horn device to express her hope for "friendship between our two Empires." The cylinder recording, the Queen commanded, "will be sealed up; and destroyed after he has received the message." It was duly played by her representative in Abyssinia, accepted with ceremony-the king stood when he heard Victoria's voice-and replayed several times, accomplishing its task. Then, Colonel Harrington reported, "The cylinder was returned to me and immediately broken into pieces as promised." But the precious relic-or at least a copy of it-survives secretly, the Queen's voice raspily preserved for history. It was her only proven contact with recorded sound.Both the telephone and the phonograph were dependent upon electricity, as was the incandescent light and the new device of the motion picture. Electric lighting everywhere at Balmoral created more glare for her than visibility in her last years, as her fading eyes were afflicted by cataracts. She would have none of it in her private quarters at other residences. At her Diamond Jubilee in 1897 she found the electric light "very inefficient." Only once, too, did she participate momentarily, in being filmed--photographed with her family by the flickering new "cinematograph." She and Albert had been great devotees of that new invention called the camera in the 1840s and 1850s, but newness had now passed her by largely as it had in fashion. Much of her life was fixed by how it had been when Albert died in 1861. Yet the public knew little of that, and when she opened a new dock or sent off a celebratory public telegraph message or fired a salute by touching a button she remained a presiding symbol of a force called electricity, familiar in 1819 largely as a mysterious and unstable phenomenon in the stormy sky. Much that had transformed her world had been unknown when the Queen was born.

Tabletop Bow and Arrows and History
Art & Culture, History
Just a few more days and we can enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving meal.
You know, deer, eel, mussels, maybe some lobster and clams. And by traditional, I obviously mean traditional — foods likely served at the first Thanksgiving get-together.
Of course, nowadays, it’s all turkey and potatoes and that can of cranberry sauce you just know someone is going to serve.
I like this fun, easy craft not just to give school-free kids something to do with their time, but to also explain the significance and difficulty of old-school food gathering.
Culinary historians say there may have been some wild turkeys at the first Thanksgiving, but it could also have been other wild fowl, such as pigeon or swans. They were very likely killed with bows and arrows or spears, the weapons of choice for Wampanoag hunters.
In about five minutes, you can make your very own miniature bow and arrow set using stuff you already have in an art bin and medicine cabinet. And who knows, you just might start a discussion about food gathering and gratefulness.
Here’s What You Need
Craft sticks
Dental floss
A knife or scissors
Q-tips
Here’s What You Do
For starters, cut notches in the ends of the craft sticks. These will be use to secure the string to the wood.
Once you have your notches, bend the sticks into bow shapes. Be careful, as they sometimes snap, but a few minutes of gentle bending should do the trick. (You can also soak sticks in water for about 10 minutes to make them easier to bend.)
Once you’re good with the shape, cut off a long string of floss and tie one end to the notches. Be generous with the floss. It’s easier to cut off excess than it is to tie tiny ends of floss …
Now, stretch the floss across the bow tightly and tie the other end. Pretty easy to do. Let’s move on to the arrows.
Simply cut one end off a Q-tip and voila, you have a soft arrow.
Best of luck, turkeys. Or swans. Or eels.

Video Transcript I've talked to venture capitalists about this stuff
for 15 years and up until a year and a half ago—this story may or may not be
interesting—but up until a year and a half ago, the response from venture
capitalists was, "All right, professor. Let's see. This
hypothetical venture depends on the weather, right, because you got to grow
stuff." Yeah. "And it depends on the price of oil." Yeah.
"And you said government regulation got in there somewhere." Mm-hm.
And it's like, well, too many variables they can't control, and so
there was just active disinterest. And, you know, it— I mean a lot of
people are using the expression "tipping point" as well as
"perfect storm." And as to why that's true, I think
essentially, because now this is regarded as one of the, you know— Green
energy is regarded as a hot area by venture capitalists.

Preview of Harlem in Montmartre
Beloved American jazz singer and bandleader Cab Calloway once said, “You hear about the Duke Ellingtons, the Jimmy Luncefords, the Fletcher Hendersons, but people sometimes forget that jazz was not only built in the minds of the great ones, but on the backs of the ordinary ones.” While far from ordinary, Harlem in Montmartre tells the story of the long-forgotten “extraordinary ones,” who left America to create the jazz age in Paris between the First and Second World Wars. After peace was signed at Versailles, many black Americans remained in Europe rather than return to the brutal segregation and racism of America. Over the next two decades, they formed an expatriate community of musicians, entertainers and entrepreneurs, primarily congregating in Paris’ hilly Montmartre neighborhood. Some achieved enduring fame, while others faded into history.
Harlem in Montmartre airs as part of PBS’ Great Performances series on THIRTEEN Wednesday, August 26th at 8 p.m. EST (check local listings). The documentary is a co-production of THIRTEEN for WNET.ORG, Vanguard Documentaries, Inc., Ideale Audience SAS, ARTE France and Independent Television Service (ITVS).
Watch a preview of Harlem in Montmartre:
Inspired by the book Harlem in Montmartre: a Paris Jazz Story (University of California Press) by historian William A. Shack and utilizing rare archival material from both France and America, this remarkable performance- driven documentary features the stories and music of such key figures as James Reese Europe, Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet, Bricktop, Eugene Bullard, Django Reinhardt and more. “The film explores a fascinating, yet often neglected, era in African-American cultural history” says producer Margaret Smilow. “It is a colorful, musical, poignant look at the contributions of a select group of black Americans, without whom the collective voice of jazz music around the world would sound entirely different.” Vanguard Documentaries Executive Producer Charles Hobson reveals, “The French were the first people in the world to respect jazz as serious art form, and it all began in Paris with the arrival of the Harlem Hellfighters, a military band.” Directed by Dante J. James, with performance sequences directed by Olivier Simmonet, and written by James and Simmonet with Allan Miller, the production was co-produced by Smilow with Hobson and Helene Le Coeur; S. Epatha Merkerson narrates.
GREAT PERFORMANCES is funded by the Irene Diamond Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts, Vivian Milstein, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, public television viewers and PBS. Harlem in Montmartre has been made possible, in part, by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities: Because democracy demands wisdom. Major funding was also provided by the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust, Hugh M. Hefner, Rolf and Elizabeth Rosenthal, the Vital Projects Fund, the Grand Marnier Foundation, The Paula Vial Fund, the Price Family Foundation and Ann Phillips.

The book was vivid, and an obvious basis
for a film. Shack was a remarkable anthropologist. The film must be very much worth seeing by lovers of France, of jazz, of history.

I can’t wait to see this too. I am very interested in expatriate African American artists (writers mostly) who made Paris their home.

Jacqueline Butterfield
I am extremely disappointed that Harlem In Montmartre seems to have been pre-empted by the documentary about the Kennedys. While I understand why this may have been done (the death of Sen. Edward Kennedy), I feel a specific audience has been disrespected by this action. I had set my TV timer a week in advance! In addition upcoming episodes are shown at the most inconvenient times. When might I expect to see this pre-empted episode at a more convenient viewing time?
Michael Bareau
Just watched your fabulous program – Harlem in Monmartre. The credits rolled by at such speed that I was unable to find out the names of the current musicians who played so well. I hope these will be posted.
Sorry it stopped at Diz and didn’t include Bird, Dexter and others who worked in Paris.

Excellent – except we couldn’t read the credits they went by so fast – where are the musicians listed?????
MG
Michael and Neil, the music director was Victor Goines, director of jazz studies at Northwestern University (and a heck of a reed player!)
Not sure who the rest of the musicians were – phone rang when Victor was discussing putting the band together at the beginning of the broadcast.
I agree. I would like to have seen more coverage of Diz as well as some Bird, Dexter, etc. but I guess if you’re making the documentary you have to decide when to stop. Bebop starts a different era in Paris (and around the world, for that matter).
Ron Ray
Excellent, how can I get a DVD of the preformance?

To Jacquelyn Goudeau, and others in the SF Bay Area, as you probably already know it was supposed to air on KQED Channel 9. As per the KQED website, it will air this evening/tonight on KQED Life (a KQED cable station), see http://www.kqed.org/tv/schedules/schedule-changes.jsp. I’m sorry that I can’t tell you if or when it will air on the regular KQED Ch 9. While I am disappointed that KQED preempted it; I am glad to know that it was aired as scheduled in a number of other media markets across the country. Many thanks to all of you who have expressed interest in the documentary, the book, and the the subject of jazz history.

i enjoyed the broadcast tremendously Paris has always fascinated me…and this was like a walk

Dorothy Lee
Outstanding program. The music was exquisite. Not to mention that my cousin from Law and Order narrated.
Patrick
I would like to purchase the DVD of this program. I would also be interested in buying a CD of the current musicians that were performing in the film.
Judy J
A very interesting documentary and great music. I had read the book “Making Jazz French” by Jeffrey H Jackson and this provided a visual for his informative history of this period.
Mamie~Louise Anderson
When will this air aain. I’m so sorry to have missed it.
Ron Erickson
I’m glad I was able to have my DVD Recorder catch an early AM airing of this – I really want to get more, like a broadcast quality DVD and a full listing of the Musicians. Amazing, inspiring, and such an important document in the history of Jazz. Please provide more access.

im sorry but who is “Dante J.James? my grandfather James Reese Europe was the director/conductor of the hellfighters.
nancyc203RN
I also eagerly awaited the program, only to have it preempted in BOTH states’ PBS stations available to me. I haven’t seen anything further about it, even on the websites. Very frustrating as it’s a combination of many different loves of mine, history, jazz, and Paris! When the heck will it be available online?

This was an excellent historical & musical program. I hope everyone can see it at least once. I had told family & friends to watch at the original airing, but many were unable to find it. Please advertise it’s future timings for the entire country. I would like to see it again, & again.

I was so looking forward to the program. It was pre-empted in my area. Please reschedule it.

The book “Making Jazz French” published by Duke University Press and written by Jeffrey Jackson is a well researched history of the influence of this great music on the Parisians during the two world wars. It relates how this new form of music was perceived by the music lovers and critcs alike. Prof. Jackson appeared as a consultant in “Harlem in Montmartre” It would be great to see this program again.

Missed this program. Will it be repeated or become available on DVD ??
Tom Newhouse
Is the series available on DVD or to download.It was marvelous.
Wolf Duvernoy,M.D,
I sax the repeat broadcast on Michigan Television and was fascinated by this excellent history with inclusion of excerpts of Django and Grapelli. Of course there are more names like Dexter Gordon, Bird and Diz, but given the time this is a phantastic introduction. Jazz is still alive in Euorpe and Paris. When will this be available on DVD???
Steve Angelone
How can I purchase this DVD?
Connie Carnicom
How can I purchase this DVD? My French teacher can’t wait to use it with her students.
Christophe Prnès
Bravo tres interessant, belle réalisation bravo Arte et S lumley for this job
Magggy Farina
Jeffrey H. Jackson’s narration of
Django Reinhardt’s music was absolutely wonderful. I have a record of Django recorded in 1947, still treasure it now as then. Thank you for a WONDERFUL show.
Herman Lee
The show was great! A great lesson in history. The musicians that played and interpreted the music for the show were great! The DVD should be in all music school libraries for teacher and student use.
Jimbo clark
I am a guitarist of 45 years and I have never heard anyone like Django Reinhardt. Thank you for the program.
Charles Bland
Please e-mail me as to how I may purchase this DVD?
Mick Shaw
Would love a dvd. Any chance
Jen D
I NEED THIS FOR MY HISTORY OF JAZZ AND FILM CLASS! Any time this will be shows again? Can I buy a dvd?
Daniel
They announced the sale of the DVD at the end of the program and I’ve been looking for it and cannot find it anywhere. I wrote to PBS shop and Thriteen and all they are saying is ask the other. INCREDIBLE INCOMPETENCE.
Besides, when will PBS treat the audience as adults? Who’s going to get corrupted by naked torsos? Stop the hypocrisy and bigotry.

Any chance that WEDU will repeat “Harlem in Montmarte”
this year? It was preempted on our local public television (WNIT) this summer because of Ted Kennedy’s
death.

Thanks, Greg. That was an awesome group and I’m glad to have their names. The whole program was terrific.
john bernat
It was the very best jazz musical documentary ever. Even with my bad knees, I was bebopin around the living room. If there will be a CD available, please e-mail me if possible.
Claire Garcia
Why does this seem to be the only Great Performances documentary that is not available on DVD? I teach a class on Black Paris, and though this was first broadcast last year, it seems the only PBS documentary that my library can’t get and that isn’t offered for sale during fundraising drives. Why?
John Walker
This really was an interesting and informative program. I’d happily purchase several copies of a DVD for gifts.
ian walcott
From Ian Walcott
I am avid follower and collector of jazz and this programme was very informative as well as enjoyable. Please inform me when the DVD will be available for purchase. I look forward to your response
Eve Frebergé
Would also like to purchase copies of the DVD. (The book is available on Amazon.)
Carol Carl
Excellent program, fabulous musicians doing the re-enactment. Thanks for posting their names.

IS HARLEM IN MONTMARTRE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE ON DVD???
b g long
There are to many adjectives to describe the remarkable documentary “Harlem in Montmartre”. I set my cable box for the next showing. Better yet, produce a DVD/CD for jazz lovers libraries. BGL

Strangely the browser I have doesn’t seem to be able to show this article rightly… It seems that a large part of it is not correctly displayed and the template of your article looks very strange. Are you sure this article has been tested under Google Chrome?
Dave
I would also like to purchase the DVD if it becomes available.
lmf
what is the name of the song about sharecroppers not returning after seeing Paris? who wrote it/sings it?
http://www.watch-dexter.com/ Almeda Schaberg
Bad news people,I’ve just heard that Dexter (Michel C.Hall) has been dignosed with cancer but is nothing big the doctors think it’s treateble.

Thanks to you for this essential info. Where I can get more article about this writting? I have a panel discussion incoming this week and your writting is related with it.
Adrien Girault
Hi Harriett
My name is Adrien i’m doing an animation/documentary retracing Eugene Bullard’s steps and the lack of recognition that he got after all his outstanding accomplishments. I was wandering if you had a bit of time to talk to me thanks.
Adrien
Can anyone from PBS or thirteen reply to all our bloody questions? Where can we get a DVD its not that hard. Or at least upload it so that we can download it.
david ernst
Dear Adrien,
Unfortunately, we were not able to make a DVD of Harlem in Montmartre. If you are really interested in the subject matter, you may purchase the book which the film was based on here.
Craig Lloyd
Dear Mr. Ernst,
As a participant in program and author or Eugene Bullard, Black Expatriate, I am disappointed that the DVD can’t be sold. Is the same reason for that why it won’t be broadcast on ARTE as previously advertised? Craig Lloyd
Adrien
ok, thanks for the straight answer
Jim Warner
Will this documentary be available for purchase?
Charlie
Saw this today (late to the party) and I have to ask PBS: this excellent documentary is STILL not available on DVD???
Really???
I’m ready to buy NOW, and can’t!
MarioAPNJ
The DVD. What is the holdup? I’m ready to buy a few copies.
holly bullard
Hi Adrien,
I’m also a related through marriage to descendants of Bullard’s–his story is a vital piece of history that I feel is missing. I have often thought how much a documentary of his life would be very important. how is your documentary going? Craig Lloyd’s biography was wonderful (see him on this thread–wonderful work Craig!)
Holly
Cookie
Thank you SO much for ‘hearing’ the pleas for help for info about this brilliant group of musicians. It’s May 2011 & I only just saw this magnificent program on our Knowlwedge Network, here in BC. I was enthralled & will now set about finding work done by these men.
Thank you again….
Tom Cunningham
Great show. Where to find credits for the program? I’m interested in who the musicians are? There’s supposed to be more info here.
E. Roberson
When will this show air again?
Caught part of it about two years or so ago as I was getting ready for work–had to leave out and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since
david ernst
Dear Erick,
As we stated earlier, unfortunately there is no DVD of the program and repeats of the program are up to your local affiliate. However, we believe repeats of this program will likely be minimal by now as the show is three years old.
Moises
As a resident of soetwhust Harlem, I appreciate that the circle opens to the neighborhood.As for the direction of the statue, there are arguments to be made on both sides, and it would probably be a matter of greater controversy if the reverse approach had been taken.On balance, I think the circle looks great even if it’s taken an incredibly long time to finish.Anyone know what is up with the fountain? It seemed that the last several months were spent working on it, but as of the past week it appears not to have been turned on at all
Chris Coffman
I enjoyed this episode when it aired on my local PBS station and would love to see a DVD available for use in the classroom!
