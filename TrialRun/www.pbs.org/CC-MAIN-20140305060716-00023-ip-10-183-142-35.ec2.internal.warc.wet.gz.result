Johnson lays out plans for his War on Poverty and the conflict in Vietnam.
I share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body, the distinguished Representative from Rhode Island, Mr. Fogarty.
I have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing for our Nation.
At home, the question is whether we will continue working for better opportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living better than any people in history.
Abroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly remote.
So our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the dangers to us are obvious and close at hand, but, rather, whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distant -- and some think that it is safe to lay down our burdens.
I have come tonight to ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that issue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad -- to continue to build a better America -- and to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.
As President Abraham Lincoln said, "We must ask where we are, and whither we are tending."
The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better country.
We have struck down legal barriers to equality.
We have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year alone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.
We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it. Three and one-half million Americans have already received treatment under Medicare since July.
We have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more Americans on the payrolls in the last year alone.
We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum wage.
We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1 million Americans.
We have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in the neighborhoods of the poor.
We have set out to rebuild our cities on a scale that has never been attempted before.
We have begun to rescue our waters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside, our cities and our towns.
We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the Neighborhood Youth Corps -- or through Head Start, a chance to learn.
So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people. And, we have succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few. Now we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress, or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been -- abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.
I believe that our people do not want to quit -- though the task is great, the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or months, but of years -- and sometimes it may be even decades.
I have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward the progress of these last 3 years. These five ways concern programs, partnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace.
First, programs. We must see to it, I think, that these new programs that we have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible way.
Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social progress. This required trial and error -- and it has produced both. But as we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we are trying to improve our tactics. In the long run, these starts -- some rewarding, others inadequate and disappointing -- are crucial to success.
One example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate among us.
On a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American President, Harry S. Truman, declare this: "The American people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease."
Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few understood what was required and did anything about it. The executive branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President presented. And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, "It will not be a short or easy struggle -- no single weapon... will suffice -- but we shall not rest until that war is won."
And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.
I recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.
I shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the Congress -- as well as some that we have learned from our own trial and error.
I shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of thousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big cities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young, little children. The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must command our full determination. For learning brings skills; and skills bring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, as well as taxes.
This war -- like the war in Vietnam -- is not a simple one. There is no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart. The enemy is not easy to perceive, or to isolate, or to destroy. There are mistakes and there are setbacks. But we are moving, and our direction is forward.
This is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground. Some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into them. Administrative skills and trained manpower are just as vital to their success as dollars. And I believe those skills will come. But it will take time and patience and hard work. Success cannot be forced at a single stroke. So we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success is to come -- as we know it must.
We have done much in the space of 2 short years, working together.
I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.
I have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department -- a Department of Business and Labor.
By combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and other related agencies, I think we can create a more economical, efficient, and streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation.
This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government. Every program will be thoroughly evaluated. Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our Governors.
Where there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them.
Where there has been progress, we will try to build upon it.
Our second objective is partnership -- to create an effective partnership at all levels of government. And I should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.
The 88th and the 89th between the executive social and economic legislation than any two single Congresses in American history. Most of you who were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those measures. But your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people.
Federal energy is essential. But it is not enough. Only a total working partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed. The test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization, each private institution, and each responsible citizen.
Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and as I see you are examining yours. Some will need to reorganize and reshape their methods of administration -- as we are doing. Others will need to revise their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date -- as we are doing. Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more efficiently.
During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments about $40 billion in grants-in-aid. This year alone, 70 percent of our Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the State and local governments. With Federal assistance, State and local governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually. These enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively.
We intend to work closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.
Our third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that we have established within the resources that are available.
I wish, of course, that we could do all that should be done -- and that we could do it now. But the Nation has many commitments and responsibilities which make heavy demands upon our total resources. No administration would more eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than the administration that started them.
So let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we have -- knowing that it is far, far more than we have ever done before, and far, far less than our problems will ultimately require.
Let us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans who need special help.
We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the early years.
We should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest years, before it is too late to correct.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their Nation's progress.
We should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20 percent. That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security payments in the first year. I will recommend that each of the 23 million Americans now receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.
I will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percent -- from $44 to $70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for those with a total of 25 years of coverage. We must raise the limits that retired workers can earn without losing social security income.
We must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age.
We should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to the forgotten in our midst -- the American Indians and the migratory farm workers. And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
So let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning of justice for all of our fellow Americans.
We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the landmark Model Cities program. I intend to seek for this effort, this year, the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.
We should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great cities.
We should vastly expand the fight for clean air with a total attack on pollution at its sources, and -- because air, like water, does not respect manmade boundaries -- we should set up "regional airsheds" throughout this great land.
We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for a beautiful America -- to clean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our cities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that come after us to enjoy.
We should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen -- before a jury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights. We should find a solution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color, has a decent home of his choice.
We should modernize our Selective Service System. The National Commission on Selective Service will shortly submit its report. I will send you new recommendations to meet our military manpower needs. But let us resolve that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as effective as possible.
We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the "right most valued by civilized men" -- the right to privacy. We should outlaw all wiretapping -- public and private -- wherever and whenever it occurs, except when the security of this Nation itself is at stake -- and only then with the strictest governmental safeguards. And we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic "bugging" and "snooping."
I hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer. We should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed where average citizens can understand it. We should immediately take steps to prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against hazardous household products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry natural gas across our Nation.
We should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000 permanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age.
We should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform and financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating lobbying, and by restoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move their residences.
We should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our classrooms. We should insist that the public interest be fully served through the public's airwaves.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
Now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our minds -- on yours and mine. This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.
The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended. We appointed the National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the best ways to carry that attack forward.
And while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its preliminary recommendations we are ready to move.
This is not a war that Washington alone can win. The idea of a national police force is repugnant to the American people. Crime must be rooted out in local communities by local authorities. Our policemen must be better trained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the local citizens that they try to serve and to protect.
The National Government can and expects to help.
And so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967. It will enable us to assist those States and cities that try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces better, their corrections systems more effective, and their courts more efficient.
When the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost:
- 90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master plans, to combat crime in their area;
- 60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on crime;
- 50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police academy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best trained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere.
We will also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from becoming adult delinquents. We will seek new partnerships with States and cities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem. And we will recommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.
At the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free America -- as Abraham Lincoln once said -- must "let reverence for the laws... become the political religion of the Nation."
Our country's laws must be respected. Order must be maintained. And I will support -- with all the constitutional powers the President possesses -- our Nation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our communities.
Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have already been laid. Some will necessarily be small at first, but "every beginning is a consequence." If we postpone this urgent work now, it will simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.
Our fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead, moving ahead steadily and safely.
We have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity.
Last year, in 1966:
- Wages were the highest in history -- and the unemployment rate, announced yesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years;
- Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent;
- Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;
- Our gross national product advanced 5.5 percent, to about $740 billion;
- Income per farm went up 6 percent.
Now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.5 percent over the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam. This was more than we had expected -- and the Government tried to do everything that we knew how to do to hold it down. Yet we were not as successful as we wished to be. In the 18 months after we entered World War II, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 13.5 percent. In the first 18 months after Korea, after the conflict broke out there, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 11 percent. During those two periods we had OPA price control that the Congress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.
Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to avoid imposing them. We believe that we have done better, but we make no pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.
Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit. They imposed very severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our homebuilders, and all those associated with the home industry.
Last January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and moderate tax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion. Legislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the economy. With these measures, in both instances, the Congress approved most of the recommendations rather promptly.
As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored. Wholesale prices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food prices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have retreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be available.
Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly seek, I am confident that this movement can continue. I pledge the American people that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest rates and to ease money in this country. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to savings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.
We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals; that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the progress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and toward lower interest rates.
I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxes -- to last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue. I will promptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these expenditures permits it. This surcharge will raise revenues by some $4.5 billion in the first year. For example, a person whose tax payment, the tax he owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an extra $60 over the 12-month period, or $5 a month. The overwhelming majority of Americans who pay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $5 a month. Married couples with two children, with incomes up to $5,000 per year, will be exempt from this tax -- as will single people with an income of up to $1,900 a year.
Now if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect when I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual taxes would have been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates. So this proposal is that while we have this problem and this emergency in Vietnam, while we are trying to meet the needs of our people at home, your Government asks for slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give our country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of trial.
For fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.7 billion and revenues of $117 billion. That will leave us a deficit this year of $9.7 billion.
For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion. And with the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate revenues will be $126.9 billion. The deficit then will be $8.1 billion.
I will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress. Yours is the responsibility to discuss and to debate them -- to approve or modify or reject them.
I welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a colleague and as Vice President and President.
I should like to say to the Members of the opposition -- whose numbers, if I am not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhat -- that the genius of the American political system has always been best expressed through creative debate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives. Throughout our history, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to understand this. So let there be light and reason in our relations. That is the way to a responsible session and a responsive government.
Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the quality of life for every American -- not just the rich, not just the poor, but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.
We all go to school -- to good schools or bad schools. We all take air into our lungs -- clean air or polluted air. We all drink water -- pure water or polluted water. We all face sickness someday, and some more often than we wish, and old age as well. We all have a stake in this Great Society -- in its economic growth, in reduction of civil strife -- a great stake in good government.
We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this country in these years. Our children's children will pay the price if we are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.
Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change. But abroad, as at home, there is a greater risk in standing still. No part of our foreign policy is so sacred that it ever remains beyond review. We shall be flexible where conditions in the world change -- and where man's efforts can change them for the better.
We are in the midst of a great transition -- a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet.
In Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly to give our hemispheric policies new direction.
We have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American effort in economic and social development was launched by the conference at Bogota in 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower. The Alliance for Progress moved dramatically forward under President Kennedy. There is new confidence that the voice of the people is being heard; that the dignity of the individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere, and we are facing up to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together. In this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happen -- because it has happened. So together, I think, we must now move to strike down the barriers to full cooperation among the American nations, and to free the energies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our citizens.
Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America. It has yet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above all, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible. There, too, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa cooperate on a regional basis. More and more our programs for Africa are going to be directed toward self-help.
The future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts. Our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those who are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races, and to help those who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence.
In the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately, has not yet taken hold. An already tortured peace seems to be constantly threatened. We shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities of improved relations among the nations of that region. We are working hard at that task.
In the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the earth's population. Over the years we -- and others -- have invested very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and Pakistan.
We are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict. It must strengthen their capacity to help themselves. It must help these two nations -- both our friends -- to overcome poverty, to emerge as self-reliant leaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation.
In Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common defense. But we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved through measures of arms control and disarmament, and through other forms of practical agreement.
We are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs, in economic and technical cooperation, in trade negotiations, in political consultation, and in working together with the governments and peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve when we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild Europe. We faced new challenges and opportunities then and there -- and we faced also some dangers. But I believe that the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both sides of this Chamber, wanted to face them together.
Our relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in transition. We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war. When we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for that matter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and without venom.
Our objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it.
We have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses of outer space.
We have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.
We have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.
We are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial credits to Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to Romania and Yugoslavia.
We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another 2 years.
We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to embassies.
We have started discussions with international agencies on ways of increasing contacts with Eastern European countries.
This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world that were entered into before I became President.
So tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by approving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile capabilities. It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile defense. My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our allies.
I would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and the United States is in our common interest, in arms control and in disarmament. We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us, if that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons and defenses. I thought we were making some progress in that direction the first few months I was in office. I realize that any additional race would impose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an additional waste of resources with no gain in security to either side.
I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the Congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing directly upon this problem.
Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human family is the race between food supply and population increase. That race tonight is being lost.
The time for rhetoric has clearly passed. The time for concerted action is here and we must get on with the job.
We believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed:
First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food production, including the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise.
Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into voluntary family planning programs.
And third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves.
Every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance.
I come now finally to Southeast Asia -- and to Vietnam in particular. Soon I will submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation. Tonight I want to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.
We are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies are committed by the SEATO Treaty to "act to meet the common danger" of aggression in Southeast Asia.
We are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the United States, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically violated by the Communists. That violation threatens the independence of all the small nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world.
We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to remain non-Communist -- if that is what they choose -- as North Vietnam has to remain Communist.
We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression.
No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by the great Thomas Jefferson:
"It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater."
We have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to prevent a larger war -- a war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the Communists succeed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by aggression and by force. I believe, and I am supported by some authority, that if they are not checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them later.
That is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that is why it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago.
You will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago. Is there anyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was not changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?
Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression -- this time it was in Korea. Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had failed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south. The Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as we said 16 years ago in Korea: "This far and no further."
I think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a stubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to settle political questions.
I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over. This I cannot do. We face more cost, more loss, and more agony. For the end is not yet. I cannot promise you that it will come this year -- or come next year. Our adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting longer than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to stand up and resist.
Our men in that area -- there are nearly 500,000 now -- have borne well "the burden and the heat of the day." Their efforts have deprived the Communist enemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago. We have steadily frustrated his main forces. General Westmoreland reports that the enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield.
So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustained -- and will be sustained -- until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more than he can ever gain.
I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of "accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resource" -- of "laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade." That, and patience -- and I mean a great deal of patience.
Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight. Because they must provide real security to the people living in the countryside. And this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces. It means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they can respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in, and that they can have a personal stake in. We hope that government is now beginning to emerge.
While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the very distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that South Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency. We can help, but only they can win this part of the war. Their task is to build and protect a new life in each rural province.
One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.
It is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence is not going to be slammed shut. They know that it is possible for them to choose their own national destinies -- without coercion.
The performance of our men in Vietnam -- backed by the American people -- has created a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of Asia and the Pacific. I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent in their homes and in their countries. Fear of external Communist conquest in many Asian nations is already subsiding -- and with this, the spirit of hope is rising. For the first time in history, a common outlook and common institutions are already emerging.
This forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of Asian nations themselves. It was precisely this movement that we hoped to accelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965, and I pledged "a much more massive effort to improve the life of man" in that part of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we were spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production.
Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of the billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the Congress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are already open. Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new directions. Their hopes are high. Their faith is strong. Their confidence is deep.
And even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying forward this constructive historic development. As recommended by the Eugene Black mission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a special authorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian regional programs.
We are eager to turn our resources to peace. Our efforts in behalf of humanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary line. The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask the Congress for funds to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam -- and their deserving neighbors who wish our help.
We shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of Mainland China and the world community -- including working together in all the tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate of the Chinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends.
We would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her neighbors' rights. We would be the first to applaud her were she to apply her great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people. And we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for security and friendly relations with her neighboring countries.
Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that we, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam through to an honorable peace.
We will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and others, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional discussions of peace -- anywhere, any time. And we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.
Until such efforts succeed, or until the infiltration ceases, or until the conflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is that we just must firmly pursue our present course. We will stand firm in Vietnam.
I think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest burden of all. With their lives they serve their Nation. We must give them nothing less than our full support -- and we have given them that -- nothing less than the determination that Americans have always given their fighting men. Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is small compared to their own.
How long it will take I cannot prophesy. I only know that the will of the American people, I think, is tonight being tested.
Whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time, and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to "get it over with" is inviting but dangerous; whether we can accept the necessity of choosing "a great evil in order to ward off a greater"; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the passions that are ordinarily loosed in time of war -- on all these questions so much turns.
The answers will determine not only where we are, but "whither we are tending."
A time of testing -- yes. And a time of transition. The transition is sometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and often quite dangerous.
But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come. We know that "man is born unto trouble." We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many men.
For all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations that concern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve, for all the issues we must face with the agony that attends them, let us remember that "those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it."
But let us also count not only our burdens but our blessings -- for they are many.
And let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.
Let us draw encouragement from the signs of hope -- for they, too, are many.
Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been found wanting.
So with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your support, we are going to persist -- and we are going to succeed.

Flute Therapy
Get the Flash Player to see the wordTube Media Player.
Ronit Azoulay, flautist: The flute is to work with her breathing. I’m breathing as I play the flute. I’m noticing her breathing rate and matching it with maybe one or two note phrases, maybe longer. She is on a respirator. One of the things that can be a struggle on a respirator is that it can be uncomfortable. So we’re both looking to influence the rhythms but also the relaxation in the body.
Research has demonstrated that we entrained to sounds outside of us and rhythms. The word entrainment is from physics originally, and in this context it means is that we synchronize with external rhythms in music.
Doctor at Beth Israel: We wanted to study whether or not music therapy would impact on quality of life, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation. The challenge of having chronic lung disease very much has to do with breathing and breathing correctly and training people to breathe as well as possible. When engaged in that effort one can see better oxygen levels, less shortness of breath.
Ronit Azoulay: During the relaxation the heart rate when down back to around 84-85 is what I had noticed when I was playing. And now after the session it’s back at around 90.
Doctor at Beth Israel: We’ve engaged with 20 patients as a pilot study. And the first observations are that [inaudible] rates do go down. Oxygen levels we have to look more closely at. It’s data accruing. Hopefully it will have some positive outcome.
Ronit Azoulay: Music therapy is a field that is continuing to grow. The research in the feld is getting more and more sophisticated and understanding how music—does it influence quality of life? Does it influence breathing? Does it influence heart and breathing rhythms as well? So it’s continuing to grow.

I truely believe that it would be safe to assume that if it is relaxing enough to slow the heart rate…the oxygen saturation would improve as well. The relaxation effects of the “therapy’ must prove positive for that as well! I would be very curious to see the effects of that particular measurement during the course of the relaxation atmosphere of music therapy! PLEASE DO keep in touch! Thanks so much for sharing!

As a current intern in the Music For Healing and Transition Program I am using both harp and flute with patients to decrease anxiety and muscle tension, hopefully raising pain thresholds. Your demo was most helpful to see work with breathing and heart rate, using the monitors present to have objective evidence of the effect of the music. Thank you, this is very helpful to me. Janie Woods Alexander in Atlanta, GA (doing internship at Emory University)
Erika Preudhomme
This I truly believe music is the key for good breathing a relaxing your mine and body. My daughter was on a resperator and was only 1 pound. Next to her she had amusic box that help stimulate her little bran I’m a true believer now hopefully,it can do the same for everyone . Such as Dorthy Hudson a 73 old cancer servivur.

Reva Dowgiallo
Everyday, I reveiw the Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, to keep my mind free of “negative energy”, and to continue “living in the moment” in peace and harmony. Right now, I just re-read the Law of Karma. I am having a challenge right now with my Landlord/Manager, and the Universe directed me to that Law to make me realize how important it is to carefully weigh my decisions in life. If I were to decide to “pursue” the conflict, then in some way, it will come back to me as “negative energy”. And since I have made the commitment now to “let it go”, then I will still be able to keep my living in the moment peace and tranquilty, and enjoy positive energy which keeps my mind, body and Spirit in sync, and assures me that Universe/God/Spirit will direct my path, and that of my Landlord. Negative conflict will only cause me to lose friends, peace, and love for others even in the midst of strife. So I have chosen to lay it all down and surrender to the Universe who will guide the outcome according to the best interests of ALL parties involved. I thank God EVERYDAY for Deepak Chopra, and his words of inspiration and wisdom. God Bless You, Deepak. And many, may, thanks for your words which keep me focused 24/7. I know I can always come to this website for solace and resolution!
Medicines
I take 4 medicines a day for Bipolar Disorder, OCD, ADHD & Depression. I have heard MANY people tell me how bad these medications are for me. But, the problem is, I am 17 & I don’t think that I can refuse medication yet. I live in Missouri & I don’t know what the law is here on refusing medication. I know that I can handle myself without the medication. But, I have also heard that you can refuse medication at any age. Since it is your body, I see how that could be true. But I am just really confused. Can I refuse medication? I am only 17 & I’m not sure if you have to be 18 in Missouri
|wat are some general medicines for infants????
|My father is 79 and takes blood pressure medicine so he can’t take any of the regular over the counter cold medicines. Because of glaucoma he can’t take Coricidin which is the usual alternative for people in his situation. Is there any medication, over the counter or by prescription, that he could take for coughing and congestion? I worry that on about the third night of not being able to sleep he’ll just not care and take one of the regular cold medicines and suffer a stroke or whatever adverse effects there are.
|Actually we do not have any vet in our area, even far away. So I want to know what human medicines can be use in birds treatment. Also what things can be added in my First Aid Kit, I want to make one. I have so many Finches, 1 Pheasant, 1 Duck and now buying Parrots, Canaries and other birds.
Also appreciate if any I can make home remedies / home made medicines.
|My doctor never gave me a list of safe medicines and I’m about to die due to my nose. Sometimes it’s runny othertimes its so stuffed up it hurts. I know that I can’t take anything like dayquil. Is there anything out there that I can take?
|I am 26 and I am low on sexual performance. I am not able to get a hard-on that would last the intercourse. I want to know some herbs or medicines that would give me permanent results. Does homeopathy have a solution? The medicine should not have any side effects. Please help.
|For example I take Benedryl or sleeping aid medicine and I want to to kick in fastest. Should have an empty stomach? Should I drink a lot or a little water? What are the perfect conditions for the medicines to work quickest?
|I mean, even herbal medicines are approved to cure sickness, what is best between herbal medicines & medicines we can buy at pharmacies?
|I am taking 3 types of hypertension medicines and because of my contract I sometimes stays in the desert for more than a year and because of this I am planning to bring along with me at least a year supply of medicines. Will it cause problem with the immigration/custom (point of origin and destination)? Do I need to bring along with me some documents (I have a medical certificate from the doctor indicating the medicines that I am taking)? Thanks and best regards.
|After how much time do the hypothroidism medicines start showing effect? How do you know if they are working?

Thank you, Virginia, for always adding knowledge to my coconut (pun intended). BHA is bad stuff: I have yet another reason to use more gentle ingredients in our magnificent vaginas. That is why I am so passionate about my organic coconut oil for vaginal lubrication: it is anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-bacteria. It smells and TASTES good, added plus for hot sex. xo

Oxygen Concentrators
My dr just put me on oxygen therapy at night because my oxygen saturation levels were dropping to about 82% at night (according to a sleep study). They brought the concentrator out Monday and I’m supposed to sleep with it on…..but, I can’t sleep with it on. The last 2 nights I have lain there awake for 2 hours and finally had to turn it off so I could get any sleep at all. It kind of makes me feel funny….maybe it’s just anxiety but it feels like my heart is doing flip flops/palpitations in my chest. I can doze off for a second and then awake in a panic with my heart racing. Plus, it’s loud but I can’t put it in the hall because we have dogs and cats in & out & I’m afraid one of them would chew up the tubing. And, I don’t like anything on my face. Does anyone have any suggestions? Are there any possible negative side effects to using oxygen? I think I’m only on 2 lpm, that’s not much is it? I think I’m just nervous about it…..can anyone put my mind at ease? Thanks.
Is high flow oxygen therapy dangerous for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension?
I just wanted to find out if high flow oxygen therapy can release blood clots or cause a stroke if administered suddenly to patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

I am 49 years old. Another tip I have found is doing my walking where there is a cart or stroller to hold on to. This way, I am able to walk a lot farther, and it is not as obvious as using a walker would be. Also, when I first get signs of congestion, I am proactive with treatment. I keep prescription cough medicine on hand and use it at the first sign of a bronchitis flare-up. This has kept me from taking antibiotics as often. I hope this helps a little. Be as active as possible, and make each day count. Embrace the good days. Lots of prayer has kept me going.

The acclaimed South African singer-songwriter-guitarist talks about his time away from the spotlight and performs songs from his holiday CD.
Jonathan Butler's story centers on overcoming incredible odds. Born in Cape Town, the youngest of 12 children, he was singing and playing guitar by age 7. By age 10, he was performing in villages to help support his family. As a teen, he landed a deal with a London-based label, and his music was played on white South African stations. He left apartheid behind in the early 1980s and moved to the U.K. Now living in Southern California, the multiple Grammy nominee has had success in several genres. He's recorded his first holiday CD and also recently launched a foundation in South Africa, focusing on music and art education as an intervention for substance abuse.	Entertainment, Music
Read the transcriptTRANSCRIPTTavis: Grammy nominee Jonathan Butler has always used music to bring people together, performing first in his native South Africa during the height of apartheid, a move to the UK began his international career.
His latest CD is called “Merry Christmas to You.” I am pleased to say that in just a few minutes, when I stop talking, he’s going to perform not one, but two songs from the new project – “O, Holy Night” and “Little Drummer Boy.” Jonathan Butler, always, sir, an honor to have you on this set.
Jonathan Butler: Man, it’s always good to see you. It’s always good to talk to you.
Tavis: You doing well?
Butler: Very well, man.
Tavis: Yeah. You been to South Africa lately?
Butler: Tavis, I’ve been home so much.
Tavis: Right.
Butler: It’s been an incredible – I’ve been to Maputo, hosted safaris. I take Americans to see my country, enlighten them about South Africa. I launched my foundation, the Jonathan Butler Foundation, while I was out there. It’s been a crazy time of traveling, but it’s been awesome.
Tavis: The work of the foundation is focused on what, specifically?
Butler: It’s focused on music education, music therapy, and also drug abuse prevention. In our townships in our areas, there’s a new drug called tik that are killing the young people in South Africa.
We have the government, local government from Johannesburg, the lottery, partnered with us. So we have about almost 100 children now, and teachers in the classrooms in schools and stuff like that.
So I’ll be spending more time at home, going into the townships, talking about my drug experience, and talking about music, which is – and all of that stuff. So it’s an awesome project that we’ve been able to finally launch after, like, 20 years of trying.
Tavis: Two things before I move on. I thought I heard you use the phrase, when I asked about the work of the foundation, one of the missions was music therapy?
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: What do you mean when you say “music therapy?”
Butler: The school, Tshwane School of Music, is in Pretoria, and it’s one of the most, like, it’s one of the oldest townships. It’s a township that would never have been recognized, even noticed.
A lot of the kids are from broken homes, are from really devastating areas, and we have found that music therapy is another way of helping the children cope and work through some of the issues.
I’ve had music that helped me through my issues just living alone without my parents on the road with adults. So we have really professionals that are in that capacity to help with the music therapy.
Believe me when I tell you Cape Town and Johannesburg and Eldorado Park, Soweto, Langa, (unintelligible), there’s a lot going on that we don’t hear on the news. But kids are being killed, kids are losing their lives.
Kids are murdering their parents because of these drug situations. We have issues with drug lords taking over communities. So I’ve partnered with a wonderful couple, Freddy and Beth Arendse, and they’ve been working in the townships for years and years with the local government. So we are doing – it’s actually moving forward right now.
Tavis: I’ve been reading about this, and I’m so glad that you’re doing the work that you’re doing there. But every time I read stories like this it breaks my heart, because you think of all that your countrymen and women went through to break the spine of apartheid.
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: Now, not unlike our inner cities, to be battling another war, another demon -
Butler: Absolutely.
Tavis: – called drugs, it’s just, it’s just you can’t catch a break.
Butler: No, I stood in Langa with the guests from my safari. We’ve done it for three years now. I took the guests into Langa Township and into where the miners, the immigrants, used to come and work in South Africa.
There’s about – we had 20 people in one room. That was the size of the room that at least 20, at least four families were living. So if you see four beds in the room, that’s four families. That represents four families.
Tavis: Yeah, not four people, four families.
Butler: Four families represented in there. It’s become – there’s economical – not apartheid, but there’s a whole nother struggle. That is there’s so much wealth in South Africa, and yet there’s so much poverty.
Tavis: Well, that’s economic apartheid.
Butler: It’s economic apartheid.
Tavis: I saw you caught yourself and I understand why -
Butler: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Tavis: But that’s exactly what it is, though.
Butler: Yeah, yeah.
Tavis: Even in South Africa, the rich have gotten richer, and poor people are still struggling.
Butler: Absolutely.
Tavis: It’s a young democracy now. We don’t have an excuse here in the United States.
Butler: But we still deal with colored, Black, and whites in South Africa, and that is, the colored community is a culture. It is a way of life, it is a – it’s a term that America doesn’t use, yeah.
But for me, having lived here and raising my children in America, when I come to America, I’m Black. When I go to South Africa, I’m colored. So it’s a whole weird way, and yet I found music, and my relationship in Christ has made me a new creation.
So therefore, I kind of look beyond that and try to speak for everything and for everyone, as opposed to just hey, I’m doing this for the colored community, I’m just representing this.
Tavis: I’m laughing on the inside, because I’m afraid to ask what they call you in London, like, the midway point. (Laughter) You’re Black here, you’re colored there – what are you in London? (Laughter)
Butler: I don’t even know when I’m in London. I say this, I say – I have a British passport, so I say I’m British, but not English. That’s what I call – I say, “Well, I’m British, not English.”
Tavis: Fair enough.
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: The other thing I wanted to ask about was about your – I know you’re going to perform a little bit later. We’ll talk about the record in a second. But pick that – would you mind picking your guitar up?
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: When you walked in – I want just Jonathan to see this – my Jonathan. I have another Jonathan.
Butler: Oh, yeah.
Tavis: I’ve got a friend named Jonathan Butler and a director named Jonathan X. But I want – when you walked in and I saw this guitar – I’m glad Jonathan’s shooting it – that thing is beautiful. I’ve never seen – the design of it, I’ve never seen -
Butler: This guy (unintelligible) -
Tavis: This is wood.
Butler: This is African teak. It’s a rare guitar because it’s all allen keys. I can take each part apart and put it back together, and it looks like a banjo. It’s African teak wood and it’s spruce, Canadian spruce.
He’s a South African builder and I really think this guy is one of the premier builders in South Africa. He came to my hotel room and he said, “Listen, I built you a left-hand guitar. You want to try it?
So he put the amp up there and I plugged it in, and I was like – (playing guitar). I just fell in love with it. He built me two, and so I’m kind of like promoting my buddy’s guitars from South Africa. There’s some great builders there.
Tavis: It sounds good.
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: It looks great and it sounds good.
Butler: I feel like if I dress bad, at least the people can talk about my guitar. (Laughter) If I sound bad, the guitar’s the one they talk about all the time.
Tavis: Yeah, see, his outfit wasn’t hitting, but the guitar was gorgeous.
Butler: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the guitar’s killing, man. (Laughter) That’s what my father used to say. “Son, polish your shoes, because if you sound terrible, at least your shoes shine.”
Tavis: Your shoes shine, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Butler: Your shoes shine, yeah.
Tavis: All right, so let me switch to the new project, “Merry Christmas to You.” Again, I’m always fascinated by artists who at various points in their careers decide they want to do a Christmas CD. What motivated you doing this at this point in your life?
Butler: Well, our friend, Dave Koz -
Tavis: Dave Koz.
Butler: – I’ve been on the road with him for 10 years doing his Christmas shows.
Tavis: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Butler: I was always the only artist after the show was over sitting at the CD signing table with no Christmas record. (Laughter) Everybody would ask me, “Where’s your -” I’ll sing “O Holy Night,” I’ll sing “Drummer Boy.”
So this, to me, this is kind of like a record-breaking CD, because it’s the first record in my whole career that I did in one week. I got off the cruise ship and I started the record on Saturday and I finished it on a Saturday.
I was like, “I’ve never made a record so quickly.” Because the songs were – I wanted to make the songs simple and I wanted to keep it personal and make it about the voice and the guitar.
You’ll hear it when I play it for you, or when you check out the CD. It’s mostly me and my guitar. The voice and the guitar. It’s not like strings or – there’s a couple of songs that have production on it, like Dave Koz plays on it and Rick Braun and my friends play on it, but it’s mostly intimate.
Tavis: I’m glad you said that. When I got the project I heard that, and I’m anxious to hear these two tracks tonight live; I’ve already heard the CD. But it’s what I love most about you, and I think what your hardcore fans like me love most about you, is that you can make it work with a lot of production, but you can also make it work with just your voice.
Just this acoustic sound. That’s what makes it so beautiful – that you are just as good stripped down as you are with all the production. That’s a wonderful gift.
Butler: I think 51 years old and 20, 30 records later, I figured, I think I also like when I’m sitting at home and I’m playing. I like the simple – just the stripped-down stuff as opposed to – my band is real small.
I don’t have horns; I don’t have two keyboard players. I don’t use tracks. A lot of artists use tracks with their shows so they can sound full. I think people kind of – when I go to James Taylor, I’d like to just hear him just go – “Fine Rain.”
Tavis: I (unintelligible).
Butler: Just on the guitar, that’s it. (Laughter)
Tavis: Everybody watches this show knows I’m the biggest James Taylor fan in the world.
Butler: Likewise, likewise. “Fine Rain” is like -
Tavis: I love JT.
Butler: I play it all the time (unintelligible).
Tavis: Can I put you on the spot?
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: Just – well, I’m putting you on the spot, but it’s also – you could perceive this as a warm-up for the two songs you’re about to do.
Butler: Okay. (Laughter)
Tavis: Just to make this point about how beautiful you are stripped down, would you play just a little bit of “Falling in Love with Jesus?”
Butler: Sure, sure, sure.
[Live musical performance]
Tavis: (Laughter) This is why I love you, man. This is why. Just hit it right on the spot, and make it sound so sweet. At our church, Stevie Wonder, a friend of both of ours, Stevie was at our church not long ago, and people saw him come in, of course, and the pastor asked Stevie if he wouldn’t mind coming up and sing a little some-some.
Butler: Yeah.
Tavis: Stevie came up and said in front of the whole church, “I wish I had written this song.” (Laughter) He said, “I love this song. It’s been in my spirit.”
Butler: Oh my God.
Tavis: He – you can go to YouTube and see it.
Butler: I do.
Tavis: You’ve seen it on YouTube?
Butler: You know -
Tavis: He killed that thing, man.
Butler: I had to tell my church -
Tavis: But he loves your song.
Butler: I had to tell my church, I go to the Dream Center downtown, and I had to tell the pastors – Stevie sang it there. So I had to get up and say, “I know you’ve heard Stevie Wonder sing the song, but I wrote it.” (Laughter)
I said, “I’ve been singing his songs for the rest of my life.” “My Cherie Amour,” and “For Once, My Life -”
Tavis: But you owed Stevie something there.
Butler: Yeah. I said come on -
Tavis: You’ve been singing his stuff. You owed him at least one track.
Butler: I know, I said – it’s such an honor, man. I sing like this and I feel like this because Stevie has really inspired me. Earl Klugh and Benson and Stevie and Donny Hathaway, those are the people that just really inspired me. Great (unintelligible).
Tavis: What inspired you, how did you get inspired to choose the tracks on the new Christmas CD?
Butler: Well “Drummer Boy,” I always do that live, and I do it very stripped down with the Cajon. I sit on a drum and I beat the drum, like I used to do as a kid. I wanted to make it more South African, chant-type, and give it a different flavor.
It’s been done in so many ways. Then I felt like all the songs needed to have a little touch of home. That’s my identity. I feel like I need to always bring that through the music.
It’s like this is a – even the Donny Hathaway song, “This Christmas,” I kind of did a different twist. The other thing is I didn’t really think about how I sounded. I thought, listen, people got to hear you roar, people got to hear you when you’re hoarse.
Just let it come out instead of trying to – there’s so many records, it’s like perfect. The artists always try to sing perfect, every line, every syllable. I just wanted to bring a little bit of home flavor to this album, and -
Tavis: Well, unless you’re having a spectacular week, you’re not going to be pitch-perfect every day in seven days.
Butler: No.
Tavis: Not when you do it in seven days. That’s a lot of (laughter) pitch-perfect in seven days.
Butler: Yeah, because what I did, I just plugged this guitar in the one channel and I plugged the vocal in the other channel, and I panned it left and right so I don’t bleed into each other, and I just rolled the tape.
I sang from start to finish, and when I was done I was, okay, take one. Next song, “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” next song. I just kind of did that as a page, page, page, page.
Then by Saturday I was done, and I told my record company president, I said, “Listen, I want to send you something to listen to. Tell me what you think.” He called me a couple of days later and said, “Man, ‘First Noel,’ man, that’s like – man, okay, I’ll pay for it.”
I said, “Thank God, thank God,” because I was like, “I’ll put it out on YouTube if you’re not going to pay for it.” But the label really supported it, and I’m really blessed, man.
There’s a couple of pictures on there from, you see a picture of my wife when we were engaged, and 30 years later.
Tavis: You’ve got a beautiful family and a beautiful story.
Butler: Thank you, man.
Tavis: I’m so glad that you are doing well and that your countrymen are going to be all right as well.
Butler: Yeah. I’m telling you, it’s – I’m so proud, man. I think eventually I need to have a little room in Cape Town so I can go home and just – it’s because out there. It really inspires me out there.
Tavis: One of my favorite cities in the whole world.
Butler: You visit a lot?
Tavis: Oh, I could live in Cape Town.
Butler: I know.
Tavis: If they ever kick me out of here, which is possible. (Laughter) If I keep starting trouble.
Butler: I don’t think so.
Tavis: It’s possible. Yeah, you don’t know.
Butler: Oh, if you start trouble.
Tavis: Yeah, yeah, I might be in Cape Town. (Laughter) The new project from my friend Jonathan Butler is called “Merry Christmas to You,” and we are fortunate tonight – blessed, in fact – to have – well, we’ve already had one song. We got a little bit of “Falling in Love with Jesus.”
Butler: A little.
Tavis: But now he’s really going to set it off with two songs from the new project. Jonathan, congratulations.
Butler: Man, thank you, man.
Tavis: We look forward to hearing you in just a moment.
Butler: Thank you. You got it.
Tavis: Jonathan Butler live in just a second – stay with us.
We conclude our holiday show tonight with Jonathan Butler singing “O Holy Night” and “Little Drummer Boy” from his new project, “Merry Christmas to You.”
Thanks for watching, enjoy, and as always, keep the faith.
