Jeff Schoenberg is co-chairing a hearing that could start the prison on its path from state to federal ownership and operation. He spoke with The Rundown Tuesday afternoon. “The state has spent millions of dollars on things like paying to have toilets flushed to make sure the pipes don’t freeze, repairing a portion of the roof, but it’s never been fully in operation,” he said. The reaction locally has been overwhelmingly favorable, he added, saying that it’s expected to have a $1 billion impact in the region. “This area is thirsting for jobs, and it’s a chance for other businesses to serve that facility and its employee population. This would be a welcome development for communities in that region who are seeking to finally have this prison operational.” In a background briefing today, a senior Obama administration official said the Thomson facility will be “[beyond even maximum security](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121454635).” After the Defense Department adds additional security around the perimeter, it will be the “most secure facility in the nation,” he said. Of the roughly 3,000 jobs created, about half would go to local residents, he said. Another administration official noted that federal prisons currently hold 340 people connected with cases of international or domestic terrorism. He said that President Obama has no intention of releasing any of the detainees into the United States. If they are moved to Illinois, the detainees would not get visits from friends or family. Rather, they would only be allowed to see their attorneys, law enforcement officials and inspectors from the International Committee of the Red Cross. *Update 5:20 p.m. ET* Russ Simpson, interim executive director for the [Tri-County Economic Development Alliance](http://tcedaonline.com/tcedateam.html), shed a little more light on the anticipated economic impact the beefed-up prison would have on the region. “Unemployment is on the order of 11 percent [in the area],” he said. “It’s been high for many years. They’re saying 3,000 jobs. If it’s half that, we’ll be excited.” The economy around Thomson has suffered since the closure of the [Savanna Army Depot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna_Army_Depot), which once employed 10,000 people, he said. “Median incomes have continues to decrease. It’s been a snowball effect for many, many years. This is an opportunity to turn this around and once again have some hope,” he said. The [prison sits](http://ow.ly/Mu6V) about a mile north of the Thomson town limits and east of the Mississippi River out of the 100-year flood plain, he said. The region is ready for the first wave of military guards and detainees and a later wave of support staff, workers and businesses. “Because we have seen population decrease and businesses move out, we have some ‘flex’ in our system,” Simpson said. “Our infrastructure is not overloaded: our schools are not full. We have plenty of housing to offer. In a sense, we’re just sitting here waiting and hoping all the ‘flex’ gets used.” As for security concerns, Simpson said: “This is going to be the safest supermax in America. Our fears are minimal.” “Wholly, throughout the geography that we think counts – a 1 Â½- to 2-hour driving radius – it’s been largely if not totally bipartisan for federal acquisition (of the prison),” hesaid.

400 Years of the Telescope | A Journey of Science, Technology and Thought
ENGLISH ESPAÑOL
Click here for a larger preview.
Panoramic visuals and engaging interviews make 400 Years of the Telescope the must-see documentary of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009.
Beautifully photographed in 4K digital cinematography, the film is a visually stunning chronicle of the history of the telescope from the time of Galileo, its profound impact upon the science of astronomy, and how both shape the way we view ourselves in the midst of an infinite universe.
The film features interviews with leading astrophysicists and cosmologists from the world's renowned universities and observatories, who explain concepts ranging from Galileo's act of revealing the cosmos with a simple telescope, to the latest discoveries in space, including startling new ideas about life on other planets and dark energy — a mysterious vacuum energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
Join us on this companion website to explore this fascinating subject as you meet the film's producers and their worldwide search for the world's greatest telescopes, enjoy captivating interviews with brilliant personalities, learn about planetarium programs in your area and discover local and faraway opportunities to experience our incredible universe firsthand.
