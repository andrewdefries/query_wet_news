The Kerner Commission and the Media
March 28, 2008 In addition to tracing the 1967 civil disorders to root causes of poverty, inequality in income and education, crime and racial injustice, The Kerner Commission singled out the media for criticism. In the section, "The Communications Media, Ironically, Have Failed to Communicate" the report stated: "We have found a significant imbalance between what actually happened in our cities and what the newspaper, radio and television coverage of the riots told us happened," The Commission criticized the media's use of "scare" headlines, and exaggeration of the scope of the riots. (For example: At the height of the Detroit riot, some news reports of property damage put the figure in excess of $500 million. Subsequent investigation shows it to be $40 to $45 million.) But the Commission also targeted deeper seated problems in the media: Our second and fundamental criticism is that the news media have failed to analyze and report adequately on racial problems in the United States and, as a related matter, to meet the Negro�s legitimate expectations in journalism. By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions.
The Commission had several recommendations for the media: News organizations must employ enough Negroes in positions of significant responsibility to establish an effective link to Negro actions and ideas and to meet legitimate employment expectations. Tokenism�the hiring of one Negro reporter, or even two or three�is no longer enough.
The news media must publish newspapers and produce programs that recognize the existence and activities of the Negro, both as a Negro and as part of the community. It would be a contribution of inestimable importance to race relations in the United States simply to treat ordinary news about Negroes as news of other groups is now treated.

Both the Eisenhower Commission's 40th anniversary assessment and the Kerner Plus 40 project undertaken by The Annenberg School for Communication and the Center for Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies (IFAJS) at North Carolina A&T State University, found that many problems remain in today's media. Darnell M. Hume noted in "The media and race, 40 years after Kerner" that "forty years after Kerner we continue to confront a reality in which news stories are routinely told 'from the standpoint of a white man's world.'" The Eisenhower Foundation Report found that "locally and nationally, there is little room for covering a host of issues that affect families, neighborhoods and communities. ....Coverage of minority communities, women, rural communities....and just about everyone else who doesn't live in a handful of ZIP codes in places like New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC is badly warped and leads to ill-informed attitudes and misrepresentations in American society."
Both studies trace some of the continuing problems to increasing concentration in the media. As BILL MOYERS JOURNAL has reported, minority media ownership is set to decline further as FCC ownership cap rules are relaxed. In 2007 out of more than 10,000 radio stations nationwide, they own only 635 - or just about six percent. And African-Americans and Latinos own only 33 of the nation's 1350 TV stations. MayorTV's Andrea Batista Schlesinger noted in our interview with her that much coverage of the urban world still follows the "if it bleeds it leads" formula  like the headlines in James Hiram Malone's painting "Ghetto Headlines," pictured above. How do you think the media's doing? Tell us on the Blog.

"Forty Years On: Kerner and the Liberal Media," John Ridley, THE HUFFINGTON POST.COM
Commentator John Ridley takes the NEW YORK TIMES and others to task: "For all the areas of society in which blacks -- and by extension all minorities -- have enjoyed some measure of parity, there is one glaring and ironic omission: the very media which is so often accused of having a liberal bias. It is, in fact, only liberal in its decades-long run of institutionalized discrimination."

Revolution '67 Air on POV on PBS, REVOLUTION '67 is an account of events too often relegated to footnotes in U.S. history � the black urban rebellions of the 1960s. Focusing on the six-day Newark, New Jersey, outbreak in mid-July 1967, the film reveals how the disturbance began as spontaneous revolts against poverty and police brutality and ended as fateful milestones in America's struggles over race and economic justice.
THE KERNER COMMISSION  40 YEARS LATER THE JOURNAL looks at an update of the Kerner Commission Report, which blamed the violence on the devastating poverty and hopelessness endemic in the inner cities of the 1960s and includes an interview with former Oklahoma Senator Fred Harris, one of the last living members of the Kerner Commission.
