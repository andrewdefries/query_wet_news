covering conflict zones
FRONTLINE/WORLD Media symposium
New York
September, 2009 This fall, FRONTLINE/World gathered a small panel of
reporters, producers, editors and representatives of media-related
nonprofits in New York to share experiences and discuss the challenges
of covering
conflict zones and repressive regimes. The gathering included large
media organizations like The New York Times, newer organizations
like Current TV, as well as numerous independent journalists working
with FRONTLINE, FRONTLINE/World and
other nonprofit media outlets.
With more journalists becoming the target of kidnappings and murders,
and as video and images spread with lightening speed, the conversation
centered on the question of how to protect reporters, fixers and
sources, as well as the urgent need to develop a set of security
protocols.
We will continue to consult with symposium participants
to develop a set of security guidelines and resources for non-traditonal
media organizations. In the meantime, we want to share video
excerpts from this event with the extended community of international
reporters
and editors concerned about these issues.
We hope this online presentation of our symposium stimulates a
larger discussion and encourages other journalists and the public
to join the conversation by posting comments.
The conversation begins with filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, who recently produced Children of the Taliban for FRONTLINE/World. Join the conversation

addis ababa, EthiopiaIt is so touching to see these stories. I thought that only the developing nation journalists were under attack like in my little experience. But now I understand that the thing is global and needs a global solution to protect journalists. I'd like to keep in touch with you and share experiences. Thank you in advance!
David LBrooklyn, NYThis was a very surprising discussion on the actual job of reporting on conflicts and ongoing crises in countries that do not welcome a press they do not control. What was most surprising was the level of professionalism among the journalists here compared to the more sensationalist ambulance-chasing caricature we've come to see on cable news.
Michael MunawarLahoreIts really hard for foreign journalists, because local journalists already know a lot of people and have or can create good contacts with them. But this security problem affects everybody.
BaghdadI strongly appraise such initiatives.But it sounds to me that this symposium was only organized for foreign reporters and it lackeda voice of a local reporter.Iraqi reporters, for example and I think this is the case in all conflict areas, have been bearing huge responsibility since late 2004 when it became dangerous for foreign reporters to go out.Theyworked as reporters, translators, news gatherers and fixers etc... and faced different kinds of threats.The important thing is not only how to protect these local reporters from security threats but also how to maintain their rights as the majority of them have been working since 2003 without written contracts that preserve their rights.Some of them got killed and others maimed or handicapped as a result to their work but their families didn't get any compensation.The majority of the Iraq reporters are being laid off by their employers, who are not interested in Iraq's story anymore, without getting appropriate end-of-service bonus.So I really advise to consider a place for the local reporters in the set of the security protocol.Good luck!
San Francisco, CAPress & troops should stay away from groundfire. Fight scientifically. Drones,cyber,electronic, bacterialogical, psychological. Enlist Silicon Valley. Make Taliban life miserable. Enlist Islam.
(anonymous)Thanks for starting a much-needed discussion around these issues.
Riverside, CAIt is very inspiring to see that despite all the problems, all the dangers and risks, there are still people willing to go after the truth in parts of the world that we in the comfortable "West" don't think about. In a time where most "news" seems to be propaganda, I'm inspired by Frontline. Thank you all. You give me hope.

Jeffrey Brown has our story. JEFFREY BROWN: This morning’s “Sesame Street” program was brought to you by the number 40… ACTOR: That’s a huge number. JEFFREY BROWN: … as the show celebrated its 40th anniversary with the help of Michelle Obama… MICHELLE OBAMA, first lady: Hi, everyone. JEFFREY BROWN: … who, as it happens, is the first first lady to have grown up watching the program. MICHELLE OBAMA: If you eat all these healthy foods, you are going to grow up to be big and strong, just like me. ACTOR: And me. Well, I’m still growing. JEFFREY BROWN: When “Sesame Street” premiered back in 1969, with its urban street setting, its cast of adult and young actors, and, of course, its Muppets created by Jim Henson, it was immediately hailed as a breakthrough in educational television for children. Several generations of young people have now grown up watching, as “Sesame Street” taught the alphabet, counting, and much more, and, at times took on tough subjects, from the death of a beloved cast member, to the current flu pandemic. ACTOR: And the first thing you have to do to stay healthy is always wash your hands. ACTOR: Come on. Wash your hands with Elmo. JEFFREY BROWN: Along the way, celebrities have regularly mixed in with a diverse cast of characters, politicians, actors, musicians, even our own Robert MacNeil, who, in 1988, reported on Cookiegate. ROBERT MACNEIL: Why did you eat the cookies? ACTOR: Well, me glad you asked that question, Mr. MacLehrer. ROBERT MACNEIL: MacNeil. ACTOR: Whatever. JEFFREY BROWN: The program also became a worldwide phenomenon. It now appears in more than 140 countries, incorporating local characters and themes. In South Africa, for example, an HIV-positive Muppet was introduced in 2002. At the same time, the program’s success spawned new children’s’ educational programming. And, 40 years later, the world of children’s TV has changed vastly, on public television and on cable and commercial networks. ACTOR: Come on. Vamonos. Concerns over TV watchingJEFFREY BROWN: And, while all that was happening, concerns about the impact of so much programming have continued. A recent Nielsen study reported that, on average, children from 2 to 5 spend nearly 25 hours a week watching TV, the highest figure on record, and seven more hours watching DVDs or sitting in front of a computer. Children's advocacy groups have also raised alarms over the commercialization of programming, most recently over a deal between Discovery and toymaker Hasbro to form a children's TV network. Amid all the competition, "Sesame Street"'s viewership has fallen. It recently ranked 15th among children's TV shows. To attract more viewers, the show's producers have greatly expanded its Web presence with character bios, postcards to send, and games.ACTOR: Take it from a frog. Always look before you leap. ACTOR: Oh, thanks, frog. ACTOR: You're welcome. JEFFREY BROWN: And, 40 years later, the Muppets still dance, sing, and teach, and the show very much still goes on. ACTOR: This is Murray saying see you next time on the "Street." Peace. JEFFREY BROWN: And now more on Big Bird and beyond in children's TV. Gary Knell is president and CEO of Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational organization that produces "Sesame Street." Lisa Guernsey is director of the Early Education Initiative at the New America Foundation and author of "Into the Minds of Babes: How Screen Time Affects Children from Birth to Age Five." And welcome to both of you. GARY KNELL: Thank you. LISA GUERNSEY, Author, "Into the Minds of Babes: How Screen Time Affects Children from Birth to Age Five": Thank you. JEFFREY BROWN: Gary, now, how much and in what ways has the program changed, particularly in light of all the changes, the larger changes, in television? GARY KNELL: Well, Jeff, the show in 1969 was really revolutionary. I mean, the founders, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett, saw that commercials were teaching kids. And the question -- and they tried to make messages now, instead of about sugared cereal, about letters and numbers. And it took the world by storm. And now 140 countries later, and in many, many different parts of media, "Sesame Street" has grown, and it has had to change with the times over 40 years. JEFFREY BROWN: But how do you do -- how do you stay relevant? I mean, we just saw Michelle Obama talking today about vegetables. So, there's an issue of the day. How do you stay relevant? How does the -- is it still based on research that you have? Or... GARY KNELL: It is. "Sesame Street" is the only children's show that is produced every single year. We produce 26 hours of U.S. programming every year and some 300 episodes around the world. And, every year -- we call this the 40th experimental season of "Sesame Street." We actually bring in curriculum advisers who can teach us about the relevant issues. It may be childhood obesity. This season now is about children in nature and healthy eating habits. So, every year, there's a different curriculum that we focus on and keep current in that way. Standards are fallingJEFFREY BROWN: Lisa Guernsey, we're talking about this vastly different world of children's television programming. How do you see the range in terms of quality? I mean, for example, how much education is there today in educational programming?LISA GUERNSEY: There's a very long spectrum. And there's still not anywhere near enough educational programming along that spectrum. When -- when "Sesame Street" got started 40 years ago, there were maybe one or two other shows that were really aimed at kids, or maybe even saying they were good for children. Today, we're seeing dozens of programs that are aimed right at that 2-5 age range. And their quality is just all over the place. So, "Sesame Street" really has set the standard in terms of how to research a program and really how to kind of dig in to, what are kids understanding from it? Are they actually capturing and cognitively understanding what we're talking about? And, unfortunately, we have not seen that many other programs doing the same thing. JEFFREY BROWN: You have had to fight -- you have to fight your way through a vastly changed... GARY KNELL: Well, as Lisa said, there were two preschool shows in 1988, "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" and "Sesame Street." Today, there are 54 preschool shows. So, it doesn't matter how great you are. Your market share is going to go down, so to speak. So, we have had to make sure that we are relevant. We do a lot of targeted outreach programs, and try to stay in the news with cultural icons, like Michelle Obama, who can deliver sort of a co-viewing appeal with parents, which has made a big difference as well. JEFFREY BROWN: Another issue, quantity issue, is, as I mentioned in the setup there, the number of hours that young kids watch TV. LISA GUERNSEY: Yes. And -- and it's pretty high. I mean, the 25 hours a week number doesn't -- doesn't shock me, honestly. As a -- I'm a mother of a 5 and a 7-year-old. I have been watching the landscape for -- for many years now. And what I see is that parents and families are really kind of stretched and are looking for opportunities where they can just say, OK, I need a break. I have got to go unload the dishwasher. I have got to make this phone call. I have got to, like, hassle with my insurance company. I'm just going to kind of put the kids in front of the TV for a little bit. We're also seeing that there's so many programs over 24 hours of the day now that kids can have access to. And, so, there's societal pressures that are -- that are at work here. And there's also just the quantity of programming. I wouldn't say, though -- we still don't exactly how much worse it is than even the earliest days of TV. I mean... Content mattersJEFFREY BROWN: Do we know about the -- how much more do we know about the impact these days? I mean, you talked to researchers for your book. LISA GUERNSEY: Yes. Yes. JEFFREY BROWN: The impact on kids. So, now we're still talking 2 to 5 at this point. LISA GUERNSEY: What we're seeing, actually, is that there needs to be a real distinction between background television and foreground TV. So, there's some real evidence of negative impact of background TV. That means shows that are just on and kids 2 to 5 may be playing around them. They might be running up and down the stairs, but they are not actually watching them. What we're finding is -- and -- and researchers at many universities have been looking at this kind of question, but particularly at the University of Massachusetts -- they're finding that children's play patterns are disrupted, and the way that they interact with their -- their peers and parents is disrupted. So, what we need to do is, parents need to be thinking much more about, OK, when I put the TV on for a purpose I need to understand that let's really look at the content. Is it educational? Are there moments that kids can actually get something out of it? And then can we turn it off instead off? Instead of just simply kind of keeping it on as a background, almost wallpaper for children.JEFFREY BROWN: Gary, you took some heat when you -- when you created some programs for under age 2. GARY KNELL: Yes. JEFFREY BROWN: The American Academy of Pediatrics has long said that children under 2 should not watch any television. GARY KNELL: Right. Well, we -- we have never really designed a show up until recently for any kids under the age of 2 because of that. But we know, through the Kaiser Family Foundation, that two out of three kids under the age of 2 are watching TV every single day. And one out of three have a TV in their own bedrooms. So, what we looked at was, could we create something that was developmentally appropriate for kids, not at six months, but kids who are slightly under 2, with parenting skills built in to make something out of it. It was an experiment. Some of it really worked. Some of it didn't work. But we're trying to address the fact that moms and dads are putting their kids in front of TV at a very, very young age. JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you, lastly, about the... LISA GUERNSEY: Yes. JEFFREY BROWN: ... the commercialization issue. Has it -- has it -- has it crept up and gotten worse, in a sense, where kids appear to be being targeted to buy products through these programs? Or -- that's always been with us in some sense. LISA GUERNSEY: Right. That's right. JEFFREY BROWN: I remember it from my own -- from my own youth. Walking advertising lineLISA GUERNSEY: Well, what we're seeing is, there's kind of a blurring. It used to be that we would see, you know -- first of all, it was complete no-no, according to some regulation, although things have been loosened since then, particular in the cable world -- to actually kind of -- quote -- "sell a toy" within a TV program for kids. But the commercials around that program really kind of, you know, it's anyone's -- it's anyone's guess what they might be trying to get kids to nag their parents about. Today, it is not so much that. It's that the characters within the programs become so engaging to children. I mean, I have seen this in my own kids, right? There's some they just really become attached to, that they want to then buy every single product they ever see with that character emblazoned upon it. And -- and it can be tough for parents to kind of say, no, we're not going to get this today; we're not going to buy this today, that we -- can't we get a lunch box that is just a nice green lunch box that doesn't have a character on it? And it just -- it takes a lot of discipline on the part of parents today. JEFFREY BROWN: It's our last minute, but how do you walk this fine line, because you have lots of -- you... GARY KNELL: Sure. JEFFREY BROWN: You know, everybody wants an Elmo. And -- you have also had -- you took some criticism when you had the sponsorship from McDonald's at a time when one of your themes is healthy -- healthy eating. GARY KNELL: Yes. Well, the Tickle Me Elmos of the world actually pay for the research and production that we do. So, we try to have a virtuous circle, where those revenues pay for the programming. It's important that we do not market to kids. And I think that's where we do draw the line. We draw that line as a distinction between other companies that really do go at them. We do not advertise to preschoolers. You will not see our characters promoting any sponsors' products. So, we're really out there trying to make a distinction here, and not exploit very young children, which is what we have got to be careful of. JEFFREY BROWN: All right. We will leave it there, 40 years of "Sesame Street" and other issues. Gary Knell and Lisa Guernsey, thank you both very much. LISA GUERNSEY: Thank you. GARY KNELL: Thank you.

Top 45 Ways to Cut Health Care Costs, According to Medical Groups | The Rundown | PBS NewsHour | PBS PBS NEWSHOUR WATCHpoliticsShields and BrooksSupreme CourtartsArt BeatPoetrynationSupreme CourtworldSocial EntrepreneurshipeconomyMaking Sen$eSocial SecurityAsk the HeadhunterPaul SolmanscienceScience WednesdayMiles O’BrienhealtheducationTeachersteachersThe RundownTV SCHEDULEABOUT USFEEDBACKSUBSCRIPTIONSPRIVACYJOB OPENINGS RECENT PROGRAMSPOLITICSARTSNATIONWORLDECONOMYSCIENCEHEALTHEDUCATIONTEACHERSTHE RUNDOWN SUBSCRIBEFOLLOW USA BLOG OF NEWS AND INSIGHTNews Now:SYRIAHealth ReformMorning Line Health Top 45 Ways to Cut Health Care Costs, According to Medical Groups +1 EMAIL BY Betty Ann Bowser April 4, 2012 at 2:25 PM EST Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesHealth care costs are currently eating up just over 17 percent of the American economy. And while there has been some slowing of this in some quarters, health policy experts project that if something isn’t done to hold it down, costs will devour nearly one quarter of the economy in just a few short years.So it’s quite an event when the very doctors who stand to make more money by ordering expensive routine tests like MRIs and CT scans — or often perform them to avoid malpractice lawsuits — are recommending that 45 procedures no longer be performed on patients unless there is a sound medical reason to do them. (See the full list below.)Behind today’s announcement are nine of the nation’s top medical specialty societies, the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation and Consumer Reports.As their “Choosing Wisely” campaign points out, the latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that up to 30 percent of care delivered in the United States goes toward tests, procedures, doctor visits, hospital stays and other services that may be unnecessary or harmful to the health of patients.Among their recommendations: re-think the use of antibiotics for non-bacterial or minor sinus infections; avoid X-rays for lower back pain unless “red flags” indicate a potentially serious disease; choose an ultrasound over a CT scan for children with appendicitis; restrict colonoscopies to once a decade for patients who have low to average risk of colon cancer; and perhaps most controversially, scale back on chemotherapy for patients who are near death. Not only do they advise that this list of 45 tests and procedures be given more thought before being performed, they are also telling consumers to ask their doctors more questions about when and why to order them.Today’s announcement comes on the heels of great pressure being exerted on medical professionals to hold down costs. Both insurance companies and other providers have been shifting the cost of health care to doctors and hospitals in the form of lower reimbursements and programs to pay doctors based on quality — not quantity — of care.These recommendations also follow two others that created controversy. The first was in 2009, from an independent panel of doctors known as the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force which advised women between 40 and 49 to get fewer mammograms. Then, last year, the same group recommended fewer PSA screenings for prostate cancer.Both of those set off a flurry of criticism about whether the federal government was trying to control Americans’ health care and ration care under the guise of health care reform.Today’s announcement gives those critics more ammunition. But it’s also a strong, clear voice from some of the country’s leading doctors warning that some of these tests are not only unnecessary but may be harmful to patients.Read their full list below and share your own feelings on these recommendations in the comments section.American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & ImmunologyDon’t perform unproven diagnostic tests, such as immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing or an indiscriminate battery of immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests, in the evaluation of allergy.Don’t order sinus computed tomography (CT) or indiscriminately prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis.Don’t routinely do diagnostic testing in patients with chronic urticaria.Don’t recommend replacement immunoglobulin therapy for recurrent infections unless impaired antibody responses to vaccines are demonstrated.Don’t diagnose or manage asthma without spirometry.American Academy of Family PhysiciansDon’t do imaging for low back pain within the first six weeks, unless red flags are present.Don’t routinely prescribe antibiotics for acute mild-to-moderate sinusitis unless symptoms last for seven or more days, or symptoms worsen after initial clinical improvement.Don’t use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) screening for osteoporosis in women younger than 65 or men younger than 70 with no risk factors.Don’t order annual electrocardiograms (EKGs) or any other cardiac screening for low-risk patients without symptoms.Don’t perform Pap smears on women younger than 21 or who have had a hysterectomy for non-cancer disease.American College of CardiologyDon’t perform stress cardiac imaging or advanced non-invasive imaging in the initial evaluation of patients without cardiac symptoms unless high-risk markers are present.Don’t perform annual stress cardiac imaging or advanced non-invasive imaging as part of routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.Don’t perform stress cardiac imaging or advanced non-invasive imaging as a pre-operative assessment in patients scheduled to undergo low-risk non-cardiac surgery.Don’t perform echocardiography as routine follow-up for mild, asymptomatic native valve disease in adult patients with no change in signs or symptoms.Don’t perform stenting of non-culprit lesions during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for uncomplicated hemodynamically stable ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).American College of PhysiciansDon’t obtain screening exercise electrocardiogram testing in individuals who are asymptomatic and at low risk for coronary heart disease.Don’t obtain imaging studies in patients with non-specific low back pain.In the evaluation of simple syncope and a normal neurological examination, don’t obtain brain imaging studies (CT or MRI).In patients with low pretest probability of venous thromboembolism (VTE), obtain a high-sensitive D-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test; don’t obtain imaging studies as the initial diagnostic test.Don’t obtain preoperative chest radiography in the absence of a clinical suspicion for intrathoracic pathology.American College of RadiologyDon’t do imaging for uncomplicated headache.Don’t image for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) without moderate or high pre-test probability.Avoid admission or preoperative chest x-rays for ambulatory patients with unremarkable history and physical exam.Don’t do computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children until after ultrasound has been considered as an option.Don’t recommend follow-up imaging for clinically inconsequential adnexal cysts.American Gastroenterological AssociationFor pharmacological treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), long-term acid suppression therapy (proton pump inhibitors or histamine2 receptor antagonists) should be titrated to the lowest effective dose needed to achieve therapeutic goals.Do not repeat colorectal cancer screening (by any method) for 10 years after a high-quality colonoscopy is negative in average-risk individuals.Do not repeat colonoscopy for at least five years for patients who have one or two small (< 1 cm) adenomatous polyps, without highgrade dysplasia, completely removed via a high-quality colonoscopy.For a patient who is diagnosed with Barrett’s esophagus, who has undergone a second endoscopy that confirms the absence of dysplasia on biopsy, a follow-up surveillance examination should not be performed in less than three years as per published guidelines.For a patient with functional abdominal pain syndrome (as per ROME III criteria) computed tomography (CT) scans should not be repeated unless there is a major change in clinical findings or symptoms.American Society of Clinical OncologyDon’t use cancer-directed therapy for solid tumor patients with the following characteristics: low performance status (3 or 4), no benefit from prior evidence-based interventions, not eligible for a clinical trial, and no strong evidence supporting the clinical value of further anticancer treatment.Don’t perform PET, CT, and radionuclide bone scans in the staging of early prostate cancer at low risk for metastasis.Don’t perform PET, CT, and radionuclide bone scans in the staging of early breast cancer at low risk for metastasis.Don’t perform surveillance testing (biomarkers) or imaging (PET, CT, and radionuclide bone scans) for asymptomatic individuals who have been treated for breast cancer with curative intent.Don’t use white cell stimulating factors for primary prevention of febrile neutropenia for patients with less than 20 percent risk for this complication.American Society of NephrologyDon’t perform routine cancer screening for dialysis patients with limited life expectancies without signs or symptoms.Don’t administer erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with hemoglobin levels greater than or equal to 10 g/dL without symptoms of anemia.Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in individuals with hypertension or heart failure or CKD of all causes, including diabetes.Don’t place peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) in stage III-V CKD patients without consulting nephrology.Don’t initiate chronic dialysis without ensuring a shared decision-making process between patients, their families, and their physicians.American Society of Nuclear CardiologyDon’t perform stress cardiac imaging or coronary angiography in patients without cardiac symptoms unless high-risk markers are present.Don’t perform cardiac imaging for patients who are at low risk.Don’t perform radionuclide imaging as part of routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.Don’t perform cardiac imaging as a pre-operative assessment in patients scheduled to undergo low- or intermediate-risk non-cardiac surgery.Use methods to reduce radiation exposure in cardiac imaging, whenever possible, including not performing such tests when limited benefits are likely.

About The Sarah Palin PollFrom John Siceloff, Executive Producer, NOW on PBS
The Sarah Palin Poll
New and Improved - One User, One Vote.
I am writing in reference to the now famous "Palin poll" that appeared on the NOW on PBS homepage on September 5. It's no longer on the homepage; in fact, it's no longer a page that the online user can navigate to using menus, but hundreds of thousands of unique visitors are still accessing the poll and voting. How is that possible, and is that a good thing? More on that in a moment, after a side trip through the world of Internet "cookies."
PBS headquarters made the decision on September 22, to implement a cookie registration system on the Palin poll. That system is now part of the poll's inner code, and as of September 23, a user can only vote once per computer. PBS acted because the entire pbs.org site had been experiencing system overload due to massive accessing of the poll.
The poll asks the question, "Do you think that Sarah Palin is qualified to serve as Vice President of the United States?" The user answers clicks to answer "Yes" or "No." From September 5 to September 22, our software allowed online users to vote repeatedly. Sounds bad, right? But we at NOW had serious concerns about user privacy. "Cookies" are small text files placed on the user's system without that person's knowledge. Many computer users regard them as invasive.
Other possible fixes: we could have insisted on voters registering with their email addresses. But people could still vote several times using different email addresses. Or we could insist on a unique identifier - a user's social security number. This was clearly way over the line in violation of user privacy.
What are other media organizations doing? CNN.com does exactly what we had been doing—their polls allow multiple votes. The website of the newspaper USA Today also uses polls, called "USA TODAY Snapshot", but it employs the "cookie" approach to restrict multiple voting.
So, is the Palin poll now "scientific"? Absolutely not. It is still subject to large scale efforts on the left and the right to mobilize people to vote. The poll has become something of a Rorschach test, a tiny political marker in a tightly contested race. Over the past two weeks, the results of the poll see-sawed back and forth from a majority saying "No" to a majority saying, "Yes". At the moment the single-voter system was implemented, it was close to a tie: 50% say Sarah Palin is qualified to serve as Vice President, and 48% say no. Those results, in my view, are actually a measure of the mobilization and manipulation efforts by partisans on both sides. Now it will be all about mobilization, and less about manipulation. Blogs on the left and right are circulating viral emails with the exact address of the poll.
Some users have raised questions about our decision to collect opinion about Sarah Palin's qualifications in a poll. For a more complete discussion, take a moment to read the September 19 column of Michael Getler, the PBS Ombudsman.
The Palin poll is no longer in our home page rotation. We've moved on to other polls; each week you'll find one in the bottom right corner of our home page. The current poll asks, "Who do you trust more to fix the nation's economic mess—Barack Obama or John McCain?" It has already attracted a lot of interest.
And let's keep in mind the purpose of these weekly polls. They invite people who might not ordinarily come to our site to participate, and they encourage people to explore the deep journalism that is offered throughout NOW's nearly 10,000 web pages and 1,000 video streams. They don't provide the nuanced interpretation of our investigative journalism and deep content, but do provide a gateway to that content. An example: on Friday, September 19, we aired a one-hour special about women and politics on our broadcast. In the days since the air date, that online video has become the most viewed video on the PBS Election Site. For online users who are deeply interested in the issues raised during this election, the polls are only a starting point. There's a lot more to explore, to read, and to view.

UPDATE: As of October 15th, the Palin poll had received over 52 million votes. We've received inquiries about why the percentages in the poll results have not changed much in the last couple of weeks. There's a simple answer. There are so many votes now that even the hundreds of thousands of new votes each day don't have much of an effect on the overall totals.
Another question is about math. As of October 15th, the "Yes" answer had 49%, the "No" answer had 49% and the "Not Sure", 0%. The question is why these numbers don't add up to 100%. Here's the reason: the poll software rounds the results down to the nearest whole number. The "Not Sure" is less than one percent, so it rounds down to zero. The rounding-down is why why the numbers may not total 100%.
With all the questions--and answers--about the percentages and the math, it's easy to take a further step and regard the results as accurate and scientific. Not so! The Palin poll is a measure of voter interest and mobilization in the closing weeks of the campaign. It should not be taken as an accurate barometer of the views of the wider public about Sarah Palin's qualifications.

In Circleville, Ohio, population 13,000, the local RCA television-manufacturing plant was once a source of good jobs with good pay and benefits. But in late 2003, RCA's owner, Thomson Consumer Electronics, lost a sizeable portion of its production orders and six months later shut the plant down, throwing 1,000 people out of work. (more) »

Thomson's jobs have moved to China, where cheap labor manufactures what the American consumer desires -- from clothing to electronics -- and can buy at "everyday low prices" at the local Wal-Mart. FRONTLINE explores the relationship between U.S. job losses and the American consumer's insatiable desire for bargains in "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" Through interviews with retail executives, product manufacturers, economists, and trade experts, correspondent Hedrick Smith examines the growing controversy over the Wal-Mart way of doing business and asks whether a single retail giant has changed the American economy. "Wal-Mart's power and influence are awesome," Smith says. "By figuring out how to exploit two powerful forces that converged in the 1990s -- the rise of information technology and the explosion of the global economy -- Wal-Mart has dramatically changed the balance of power in the world of business. Retailers are now more powerful than manufacturers, and they are forcing the decision to move production offshore." "Wal-Mart has reversed a hundred-year history that had the retailer dependent on the manufacturer," explains Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara. "Now the retailer is the center, the power, and the manufacturer becomes the serf, the vassal, the underling who has to do the bidding of the retailer. That's a new thing." To understand the secret of Wal-Mart's success, Smith travels from the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., to their global procurement center in Shenzhen, China, where several hundred employees work to keep the company's import pipeline running smoothly. Of Wal-Mart's 6,000 global suppliers, experts estimate that as many as 80 percent are based in China.
"Wal-Mart has a very close relationship with China," says Duke University Professor Gary Gereffi. "China is the largest exporter to the U.S. economy in virtually all consumer goods categories. Wal-Mart is the leading retailer in the U.S. economy in virtually all consumer goods categories. Wal-Mart and China are a joint venture." When trade agreements were signed between the U.S. and China in the 1990s, bringing China into the World Trade Organization, American political and business leaders embraced the idea. China's 1.2 billion people were viewed as an enormous untapped market for American-made goods. The reality, experts say, is the opposite. China's exports to the U.S. have skyrocketed.
At a salary of only 50 cents an hour or $100 a month, Chinese labor is an unbeatable bargain for international business. And the Chinese government is doing everything it can to be sure the country's infrastructure supports the export business. Ten years ago Shenzhen's main port did not exist. Today it's on the verge of becoming the third busiest port in the world. Wal-Mart estimates it imports $15 billion of Chinese goods every year and concedes that the figure could be higher -- some estimates range as high as $20 or $30 billion. Company executives are quick to point out they have always scoured the globe for low cost suppliers to benefit the American consumer.
"We do depend on products from around the globe to draw our consumers into the stores," says Ray Bracy, Wal-Mart's vice president for federal and international public affairs. "We feel they need to have the best product, the best value, at the best price we can achieve."
Some experts contend Wal-Mart's "everyday low prices" are causing a clash between the interests of Americans as workers and the desires of Americans as consumers. "If people were only consumers, buying things at lower prices would be just good. But people also are workers who need to earn a decent standard of living," says economist Larry Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute. "The dynamics that create lower prices at Wal-Mart and other places are also undercutting the ability of many, many workers to earn decent wages and benefits and have a stable life." Economist Brink Lindsey of the Cato Institute sees it another way. "I think Wal-Mart is good for America," he says. "Wal-Mart is doing what the American economy is all about, which is producing things consumers want to buy … offering consumers a wide range of goods at rock-bottom prices. It is meeting the market test."
This is little consolation to the unemployed workers back in Circleville, Ohio. Steve Ratcliff, a long-time worker at the Thomson plant puts it simply: "If you want these low prices, then you go buy your products from Wal-Mart. But what does that actually do for this country? It's putting people out of work. And it's lowering our standard of living. That's the bottom line." Ironically, for Ratcliff and his former colleagues, there are new jobs coming to town. In a patch of farmland right next to the vacant Thomson plant, Wal-Mart has broken ground on one of its new Supercenters. But the Wal-Mart jobs will represent a steep cut in pay from the $15 to $16 an hour workers made at Thomson, and a far cry from the pension, health care, and job security benefits that have long been the norm in manufacturing. home + introduction + watch online + secrets of wal-mart's success + transforming america
