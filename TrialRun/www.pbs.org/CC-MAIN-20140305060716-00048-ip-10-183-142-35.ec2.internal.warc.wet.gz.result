State Dept. Punishes Employee For Linking to WikiLeaks
Follow @smoughtsOctober 20, 2011, 12:09 pm ET by Sarah Moughty	E-Mail ThisTweet	Peter Van Buren, a career foreign service officer, said yesterday that the State Department has suspended his top secret security clearance indefinitely because of a post on his personal blog from which he linked to diplomatic cables published on WikiLeaks.
Van Buren said he believed the move was in retaliation for his recently published book, We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People.
“I’m fairly close to retirement [from government work] and this is a way of not allowing me to retire with a security clearance,” he told Wired‘s Kim Zetter. “It’s like having a big scarlet ‘loser’ painted on my forehead.”
The indefinite suspension, Van Buren says, means that he cannot challenge the decision in the courts, as he would be able to had the department revoked his clearance.
Back in December, after WikiLeaks’ publication of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables, the State Department reminded employees that they were not allowed to view the documents unless they had the proper security clearance. (The New York Times memorably described the order as “a classic case of shutting the barn door after the horse has left.”) The Pentagon also issued a directive saying that viewing classified documents from unclassified computers would create “a security violation.”
Recently released figures show that more than 4.2 million people hold security clearances, a figure that is nearly the entire population of Washington D.C. As Top Secret America‘s Dana Priest has reported, the clearances can be very lucrative for those who move into the private sector after retiring from government service.
Coincidentally, when Van Buren served in Iraq in 2009-10, his office at Forward Operating Base Hammer was located across the hall from the office where Bradley Manning worked. Manning is the Army intelligence analyst accused of leaking more than half a million classified documents to WikiLeaks.
“I don’t think I ever met the guy,” Van Buren told Wired. “The last time I had access to U.S. government secrets was on the Army system that Bradley Manning used.”

Saponi Indians-Stories my Grandmother told?	Cassandra Green-katy Texas May 23, 2012
Hello Mr. Gates, enjoy your show immensely. My grandmothers dads family, migrated from Huntsville Virgina, to Huntsville Texas, some say with Sam Houston. “Again stories my granmother told”. Sitting in the kitchen with her as she cooked she told stories of her Dad William (Bill) Branch. Cousin to reknown Houston Texas minister E. Stanley Branch, the E. for Eldridge. She (my granmother) also named after her dad, Willie Lou Branch, was very proud of this side of her family, She was a very striking woman, tall about 5’7 slender, wavy waist length hair, refined features.
She was always asked if she was of indian mix, I can recall she would always say, not oklahoma or Cherokee, I asked her one day well what type of indian, that’s when she informed me, Saponi. I have looked up Saponi and true they are native of Virginia.
I recall my grandmother with great interest and fondness, when researching her surname, Branch, the census has some as mulotto’s. Which is also very interesting.
Did the Branch family migrate with Sam Houston? Are they decendents of Saponi indians?
If ever your show is about Saponi Indians and their decendants, I’m available.

Well, I have seen the name Branch in some history book or other, but that is of little help. On hte other hand, unless your grandmother had researched hte tribes of Virginia somewhere, then she was almost certainly telling hte truth.
I do not know that anyone literally immigrated WiITH Sam Houston: I read htat he went htere on his own, but that is from a work of fiction, however accurate – I’d look for ohter sources .

Hi Cassandra, my great great grandmother was Emeline Holland ( I do not know her maiden name )…from Virginia. We recently acquired a photo of her which stated on the back that she was 1/2 Blackfoot Native American—on her census records, she and her children are listed Mulatto. I had found a website re: Saponi Native Americans….thought that very interesting. I have submitted my DNA to see if this could be a possibility. I recently found cousins that also had heard we were Blackfoot and we hope to have their descendants take the DNA testing as well. We would like to confirm the oral histories. I live in Rhode Island and my new found cousins live in New Jersey. I would love to compare notes-my email address: mh07090@aol.com. Have you had a DNA test as yet? I went through Family Tree DNA in Texas. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Michele Holland

Why in God’s green earth would a Balck foot travle down from Cananda , east across the great plains, down nearly the full length of the Mississisppi river, through the state of Tennesee or Kentucky, across the Appalachians or down into Alabama , up through Georgia, South Carolina, NorthCarolina … just to have a child by a woman whom he’d f- if he’s like many of hte plains tribes – find contemptous ?
