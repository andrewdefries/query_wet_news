Immigration Ruling Won't be End of the Road By Joan Biskupic, Reuters As the Supreme Court readies a decision on Arizona's tough immigration law, the consensus among advocates on both sides is that at least part of the measure will be upheld. If that happens, a separate pending case might block the law from taking effect.

Face to Face, Obama Tries to Persuade Putin on Syria By Helene Cooper, New York Times President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, finally had their face-to-face meeting on Monday, as Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Putin to work with him to ease President Bashar al-Assad of Syria out of power, a move increasingly viewed by the West as the only way to end the bloodshed that has been under way there for more than a year.

The Rust Belt is Dead. Long Live the Rust Belt! By Beth Reinhard, National Journal The road to the White House has long run through Midwestern and Northeastern states paved with "iron, coke, chromium steel," as Billy Joel sang when he memorialized Allentown, Pa., in his 1982 hit song of that name. Since 1960, no candidate has won a presidential election without capturing the Rust Belt's buckeyed heart in Ohio. Just ask George W. Bush, who would have been relegated to one term if not for the voters in Ohio's small towns and rural areas who lifted him to victory in 2004.

Maine Candidate: Don't Assume Party Affiliation By Susan Davis, USA TODAY Angus King is running for the Senate on a campaign pledge to tell voters how he will vote right after they elect him in November. The independent candidate, a popular former governor, is the front-runner in the open race for the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe. He is running a campaign on a platform of changing Congress and resisting partisanship, which is complicated by the fact that senators must align with a party to receive committee assignments and determine control of the chamber. King won't say before Election Day whether he will align himself with Republicans or Democrats if he wins.

On and Off the Romney Bus, Tryouts for a Spot on the Ticket By Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker, New York Times One of the most secretive rituals of the presidential race unfolded in plain sight over the weekend as Mitt Romney stood a few paces behind, watching and smiling, while a procession of prospective running mates delivered their best arguments against President Obama’s re-election.

Obama’s New Approach: Bypassing Congress By Charles Babington, Associated Press There’s not much President Barack Obama can do to boost the economy in the next five months, and that alone might cost him the November election. But on a range of social issues, Obama is bypassing Congress and aggressively using his executive powers to make it easier for gays to marry, women to obtain birth control, and, now, young illegal immigrants to avoid deportation.

Romney Knocks Obama’s Immigration Move but Struggles to Offer an Alternative Plan By Philip Rucker and Dan Balz, Washington Post Mitt Romney criticized President Obama’s decision to stop deporting some illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children as an election-year political move, but he repeatedly declined in an interview Sunday to lay out an alternative plan.

Muslim Brotherhood Candidate Declares Victory in Egypt By Nancy A.

An Election Referendum or a Choice? By Doyle McManus, Los Angeles Times Is November's presidential election a referendum on President Obama's record or a choice between two different approaches to government? How voters answer that question could well determine the outcome.

Less Talk, More Stimulus By Deborah Solomon, Bloomberg News Anyone expecting bold new ideas to resuscitate the economy from President Barack Obama’s speech on Thursday probably came away disappointed. It’s not that Obama’s proposals -- a mix of tax credits for small businesses and clean energy, and spending on infrastructure and education -- are bad. It’s just that they’re shopworn and too timid to break the political stalemate in Washington. The Democratic president effectively showcased the differences between his vision and Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s plan for a rollback of regulation and $5 trillion in new tax cuts. Unfortunately, drawing these distinctions won’t do much for the U.S. economy; it’s stalling now.

Obama to Order Immunity for Young Illegal Immigrants By Christi Parsons and Kathleen Hennessey, Los Angeles Times President Obama has ordered his administration to stop deporting young immigrants who came to the U.S. as young children and who do not pose a security threat, senior administration officials said this morning. Effective immediately, young immigrants who arrived before they turned 16 will be allowed to apply for work permits as long as they have no criminal history and meet a series of other criteria, officials said.

Newly Confident Romney Entering Aggressive Phase By Sam Youngman and Steve Holland, Reuters A space of only five minutes revealed a lot about the aggressive new phase an increasingly confident Mitt Romney is entering. In a poke at President Barack Obama, the Republican challenger timed a speech in Ohio on the economy to begin just minutes before his Democratic rival gave a major address on the same topic in the same battleground state.

Obama Offers Vigorous Defense of his Presidency in Speech By Amy Gardner and Karen Tumulty, Washington Post President Obama declared Thursday that he and Republican opponent Mitt Romney offer radically different, irreconcilable visions for how to lead the nation back to prosperity, saying it is up to voters to “break that stalemate.” The president’s 54-minute speech here, which at times had the ring of a State of the Union address, represented an effort to regain his footing and reframe his argument for reelection after two weeks of dismal economic and political news.

In New Gambit, Obama Asks Voters to Break Washington Stalemate By Major Garrett, National Journal The choice election that President Obama talks about is now moving, by his own rhetoric, closer to a referendum on his record in office. That’s but one unmistakable consequence of Obama’s repeated call for voters this November to “break the stalemate” in Washington by giving him another term in office. In his 54-minute speech in Cleveland, Obama once again called the election a choice. But he also said breaking the political and policy stalemate in Washington is all the election is about. Everything else, Obama said, is “just noise, just a distraction.”

Egyptian Court Rulings Seen as Reversal of Last Year’s ‘Revolution’ By Nancy A. Youssef, McClatchy Newspapers With a pair of court rulings, forces aligned with fallen former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak succeeded Thursday in reversing many of what had been considered democratic gains that have taken place here in the 16 months since Mubarak was toppled from power. Critics denounced the developments as the equivalent of a coup.

Obama Says Election Offers a Clear Choice on the Economy’s Long-Term Path By Helene Cooper and Michael Barbaro, New York Times Framing his re-election bid as a stark choice between government action to lift the middle class and a return to Republican economic policies that he said had caused a deep recession, President Obama on Thursday called the presidential decision facing Americans a clear-cut one that will determine the long-term trajectory of the economy.

Second-Guessing President Obama By Alexander Burns and John F. Harris, Politico President Barack Obama has long made clear he doesn’t like the Washington echo chamber. And, lately, the Washington echo chamber doesn’t think much of him, either. A series of stubbed toes, so-so polls and sour headlines is serving to remind Obama’s re-election team of an iron law of politics: When your luck turns cold, everyone’s a critic.

Battleground Ohio: Romney Hopes to Ride 2010 Wave By Charles Babington, Associated Press The office of Chase Ritenauer, the Democratic mayor of this north-central Ohio city, overlooks peacefully moored sailboats on Lake Erie—and a sewage treatment plant. So it goes for Ohio Democrats this election year: Some things look a lot better than others. Republican Mitt Romney, they admit, has a real chance of putting the state back into the GOP column after President Barack Obama's hard-fought win in 2008.

Does Syria Face a Genocidal Future?
April 9, 2013, 9:41 pm ET by Philip Bennett	E-Mail ThisTweet	The agony of Syria couldn’t have been far from President Obama’s mind one morning last April when he visited the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, a short ride across the National Mall from the White House, to announce a series of new policies aimed at arresting threats of genocide around the world.
“Anti-Alawite rage has been documented in reports of executions and by the Sunni slogan about a cleansed post-war Syria, ‘Christians to Beirut, Alawites to the grave!’”
“We need to be doing everything we can to prevent and respond to these kinds of atrocities, because national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your own people,” he said to applause. He lamented “a bitter truth – too often, the world has failed to prevent the killing of innocents on a massive scale. And we are haunted by the atrocities that we did not stop and the lives we did not save.”
Tens of thousands of Syrian civilians have died in the last year, and the pace quickens. The United States, United Nations, the Arab League and others have been ineffective in shielding civilians or penalizing their killers. Today, Washington is living with the “bitter truth,” surprisingly silent about the urgency of preventing or responding to mass atrocities.
A report last month by a former special adviser on Syria to the Obama administration underscores the stakes of the failure. Ambassador Frederic C. Hof found Syria hurtling towards “full blown sectarian warfare.” His report, commissioned by the Holocaust Museum, concludes: “Left on its current trajectory, Syria is on the path to state failure and sustained sectarian violence, featuring mass atrocities and cleansing that could amount to genocide in some areas.”
The war in Syria did not begin as a sectarian conflict, Hof writes, but it has rapidly devolved into one. President Assad bears principal responsibility by enlisting soldiers and thugs drawn from his minority Alawite sect to terrorize mostly Sunni towns and cities. In recent months, armed opponents of the regime have embraced a stronger Sunni identity, with growing ranks of Islamist fighters, including some who claim association with Al Qaeda.
Because of Assad’s manipulative promotion of sectarian warfare, Hof found, those most at risk of genocide are not the Sunni civilians currently being tortured, assassinated and bombed, but Assad’s own base, the Alawites, who make up 12 percent of Syria’s 22.5 million people. Anti-Alawite rage has been documented in reports of executions and by the Sunni slogan about a cleansed post-war Syria, “Christians to Beirut, Alawites to the grave!”
The measures Obama announced last April included the creation of an Atrocities Prevention Board, an interagency group that meets monthly. Samantha Power, a forceful human rights advocate who argued for the 2011 U.S. intervention in Libya on humanitarian grounds, chaired the board until she left the administration earlier this year. The president also commissioned the first-ever National Intelligence Estimate on mass atrocities and genocide, an exercise that collects data and analysis from across U.S. intelligence agencies. A year later, it is not known publically if the study was completed.
Reporting about mass atrocities, mounting sectarian conflict and warnings of potential genocide have been nearly continuous over the last year, much of it coming from advocacy groups and non-governmental organizations such as the International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights. These studies have complemented courageous reporting from the field by a handful of journalists.
In FRONTLINE’s Syria Behind the Lines, filmmaker Olly Lambert recorded vivid episodes of the terror visited on Sunni civilians by government airstrikes, artillery and snipers. But he also found deep and raw hatreds festering on both sides, as once-neighborly Alawite and Sunni residents in the Orontes River valley spout sectarian slogans and vow to exact revenge as soon as one side prevails. Increasingly, this appears to be how the war is lived everyday.
The window into this critical part of the Syrian conflict remains extremely narrow. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 32 journalists have been killed since the start of the uprising. About a dozen remain missing, including Austin Tice, a freelancer for McClatchy newspapers and The Washington Post and James Foley of GlobalPost. The deaths of veteran correspondents Anthony Shadid of the New York Times and Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times in Britain, among other examples, have robbed the world of two of the most enterprising and knowledgeable chroniclers of the region, and of their credible first-hand accounts of the war.
Hof recommends in his report that the United States and its allies move quickly to help a mainstream opposition group establish a legitimate, non-sectarian government inside Syria. Such an effort, he argues, would require international recognition, money and “help with self-defense,” short of direct outside military intervention. Aid would be conditioned on creation of a government committed to “civil society, rule of law and protection of vulnerable populations.”
The status quo, leading to a “failed state,” promises incalculable suffering.
“The longer the Assad regime remains in place,” he writes, “the greater the chances of massacres multiplying and even becoming commonplace, as the regime’s use of largely Alawite forces will continue to fuel the opposition’s radicalization and the vicious cycle that it causes.”
