Host and narrator Liev Schreiber Credit: Courtesy of Stephanie Berger PBS ANNOUNCES “SUPERHEROES NIGHT” ON OCTOBER 15th – Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle to be shown in one three-hour programming block, beginning at 8pm ET (check local listings) –
ARLINGTON, VA; SEPTEMBER 5, 2013 – PBS announced today that Tuesday, October 15, 2013, is “Superheroes Night,” featuring a three-hour block dedicated to the groundbreaking program SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE. The newest film from Emmy Award-winning producer/director Michael Kantor (BROADWAY: THE AMERICAN MUSICAL; MAKE ‘EM LAUGH: THE FUNNY BUSINESS OF AMERICA) will premiere at 8:00 p.m. ET and include insightful interviews from Stan Lee; actors Adam West (TV’s “Batman”) and Lynda Carter (“Wonder Woman”); Geoff Johns (chief creative officer, DC Comics), Jeph Loeb (head of television for Marvel Entertainment); Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon (The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay) and cartoonist/author Jules Feiffer (the long-running strip “Feiffer”), as well as appearances by the late comic book icons Joe Simon (co-creator of Captain America) and Jerry Robinson (who helped create the Joker). A full list of interviewees who appear in the show is located at the end of the release. SUPERHEROES, cowritten by Kantor and Laurence Maslon, was initially to premiere October 8 and play over three weeks, but the series will now be a one-evening event of super entertainment. Narrated and hosted by Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Showtime’s Ray Donovan), SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE is the first documentary to examine the dawn of the comic book genre and its powerful legacy, as well as the evolution of the characters who leapt from the pages over the last 75 years and their ongoing worldwide cultural impact. It chronicles how these “disposable diversions” were subject to intense government scrutiny for their influence on American children and how they were created, in large part, by the children of immigrants whose fierce loyalty to a new homeland laid the foundation for a multi-billion-dollar industry that is now an influential part of our national identity. “SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE is one of the most comprehensive surveys of the vibrant comic book industry ever created; it explores cultural histories in an entertaining and educational way — just as PBS viewers have come to expect,” said Donald Thoms, Vice President, Programming and Talent Management for PBS. SUPERHEROES will be presented in three one-hour parts: PART ONE, 8 PM: “Truth, Justice, and the American Way” (1938-1958) During the Depression, the popularity of dozens of superhero characters opens the door for a new generation of artists and writers. World War II creates a patriotic fervor for star-spangled adventurers to represent the American spirit at war and on the home front, but in the 1950s, superheroes are caught in the fire of government scrutiny and regulation. When the thrilling “Adventures of Superman” is broadcast on the new medium of television, America’s first and greatest superhero leads the entire comic book industry to renewed strength. PART TWO, 9 PM: “Great Power, Great Responsibility” (1959-1977) In the 1960s, a new breed of superhero emerges in the pages of Marvel Comics, inspired by the age of atomic energy and space travel and, in turn, inspiring the pop culture and pop artists of the time. Spider-Man, the Hulk and others are the first to have “problems” with which an adult audience can identify, and contemporary social issues make their way into comic books. Black powerhouses such as the Black Panther and Luke Cage appear on the scene, and the pages of “Green Lantern/Green Arrow” explode with relevant storylines as comic books are forced to confront the reality of an increasingly complex world. PART THREE, 10 PM “A Hero Can Be Anyone” (1978-Present) Modern enthusiasm for superheroes has been embraced in all forms of media and by all demographics, beginning with the historic Superman movie featuring Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel. In 1986, Batman is overhauled as The Dark Knight to reflect the nocturnal underside of his character, and Watchmen bring new sophistication to comic book narratives, illuminating a violent and politicized world. In the burgeoning new millennium, superheroes have taken over popular culture with feature films, television shows and video games complementing a new generation of web-based comics that bring superhero adventures to every corner of the world. A new book based on SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE, titled Superheroes!: Capes, Cowls, and the Creation of Comic Book Culture and penned by series co-writer Laurence Maslon and filmmaker Michael Kantor, will be available October 1, 2013, from Crown Archetype, a division of Random House. This stunning companion volume tells the story of the superhero in American pop culture, with interviews, character biographies and more than 500 illustrations both essential and rare. PBS Distribution will release the DVD and Blu-ray version of SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE on October 15, 2013, coinciding with the PBS broadcast. The DVD will be available for a suggested retail price of $24.99 and the Blu-ray will be available for a suggested retail price of $29.99. The running time is 180 minutes and will include exclusive extra features. SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE is produced by Ghost Light Films in association with Oregon Public Broadcasting. Along with PBS, major funding for the series was supplied by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Founded in 1996, Ghost Light Films created the critically acclaimed and Emmy-nominated six-part PBS series Make ‘Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America, which was hosted by Billy Crystal and produced by Thirteen/WNET New York, in association with BBC-TV. In 2005, Ghost Light Films produced three hours of documentary material to accompany the 40th anniversary re-release of the film The Sound of Music, including a documentary hosted by Julie Andrews. That same year, Ghost Light garnered the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction series for Broadway: The American Musical with Thirteen/WNET New York, NHK Japan and BBC in association with Carlton International. Most recently Ghost Light created Broadway Musicals: A Jewish Legacy (narrated by Joel Grey) for the GREAT PERFORMANCES series on PBS. For more information, visit www.ghostlightfilms.net In addition to the names listed earlier in this release, the full list of interviewees who appear in SUPERHEROES includes: artist Neal Adams, Ed Catto (Bonfire Agency), writer Chris Claremont, writer Gerry Conway, writer Paul Dini, writer Mark Evanier, writer and editor Danny Fingeroth, historian William Foster, artist Ramona Fradon, artist Irwin Hasen, the late artist Carmine Infantino, writer and artist Phil Jiminez, writer Gerard Jones, publisher Jenette Kahn, the late artist Joe Kubert, artist and co-publisher of DC Comics Jim Lee, comic store owner Mike Malve, artist/writer Todd McFarlane, screenwriter Ashley Miller, writer Grant Morrison, writer Gary Phillips, writer/editor Denny O’Neil, writer Trina Robbins, chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment Joe Quesada, casting director Andrea Romano, artist/designer Arlen Schumer, writer Louise Simonson, writer/artist Walt Simonson, Man of Steel director Zack Snyder, artist/writer Jim Steranko, writer J. Michael Straczynski, colorist Christina Strain, writer/editor Mark Waid, writer/editor Len Wein, writer Marv Wolfman and author Bradford Wright.

Blitzer, Chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said. Photo by Laura Segall/Bloomberg via Getty Images.*Tuesday morning’s news features a few economic downers: U.S. consumer spending is flat, as Americans save more; unemployment in the eurozone has reached new peaks. But on the U.S. housing front, the latest Case-Shiller numbers are in, and from April to May, all signs are positive. For the first month in recent memory, all 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index saw an increase in prices, even bedraggled Detroit.To view a particular city, click Hide All and then select the city’s label.Click and drag your mouse on the chart to zoom in on a particular span of time.Use the box at top to choose your view: quarterly percent change, yearly percent change, monthly index value. Reaction from the usual sources (New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times) isn’t in yet as I’m writing this. Only Bloomberg has commented, and with a curiously temperate headline: “Home Prices in U.S. Fell Less Than Forecast in Year to May.” The meaning: from last May to this one, “year over year,” prices are still down. Considering that last month prices were revving up in every market but Motown, however, and that this month even Detroit is no longer in reverse, a bit more optimism may be in order. How about: “U.S. Home Prices Up Everywhere for Second Month in a Row (even Detroit)”? To the extent that recoveries are self-fulfilling prophecies, accentuating the positive might be just what the economic doctors ordered. Assuming, of course, that two months makes a trend. And, in the spirit of even-handedness, there was a rally in prices in 2010. It sure fizzled. Prices not adjusted for inflation.Where are prices in the larger scheme of things? Back to 2003 levels, which, incidentally, is when we ran our first story on the possibility of a housing bubble. We ran our second one in November of 2006 featuring one of the first TV appearances by the man subsequently known as Dr. Doom: NYU economist Nouriel Roubini. Unfortunately, the grim doctor continues to have a grim prognosis for the U.S. and world economies.Interactives by Justin Myers.This entry is cross-posted on the Making Sen$e page, where correspondent Paul Solman answers your economic and business questions Follow @paulsolman SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERhousing Making Sen$e PREVIOUS POSTRomney’s Comments in Israel Overshadow Visit to PolandNEXT POST What Impact Would Eliminating the Payroll Cap Have on Social Security?

Civil protection officials distributed bread and water to people who lay on the grass next to heaps of their belongings.Berlusconi told reporters in L’Aquila that tent cities and field hospitals would be set up there and hotels on the Adriatic coast would be requisitioned to shelter the homeless.Hospitals asked doctors and nurses throughout Italy to help. The smell of gas filled parts of the mountain towns and villages, pouring out of ruptured mains.Most of the dead were in L’Aquila, a 13th-century mountain city near the epicenter about 60 miles east of Rome, and surrounding towns and villages in the quake-prone Abruzzo region that has had at least nine smaller jolts since the beginning of April.The quake took a massive cultural toll as well, with heavy damage to multiple centuries-old churches in isolated villages in the area. Damage to ancient monuments has been reported as far as Rome.A wall of the 13th century Santa Maria di Collemaggio church collapsed and the bell tower of the Renaissance San Bernadino church also fell. The 16th castle housing the Abruzzo National Museum was damaged.Houses, historic churches and other buildings were demolished in the worst quake to hit Italy since Nov. 23, 1980, when one measuring 6.9-magnitude hit southern regions, leveling villages and causing some 3,000 deaths.The U.S. Geological Survey said the big quake was magnitude 6.3, but Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics put it at 5.8. Multiple aftershocks followed.“When the quake hit, I rushed out to my father’s house and opened the main door and everything had collapsed. My father is surely dead. I called for help but no one was around,” Camillo Berardi told Reuters in L’Aquila.Rubble was strewn throughout the city of 68,000 people and nearby towns, blocking roads and hampering rescue teams. Old women wailed and residents armed with nothing but bare hands helped firefighters and rescue workers tear through the rubbleRescue crews demanded quiet as they listened for signs of life from other people believed still trapped inside.A man dressed only in his underwear wept as he was pulled from the debris and embraced. A body lay on the sidewalk, covered by a white sheet.Parts of L’Aquila’s main hospital were evacuated because they were at risk of collapse, and only two operating rooms were in use. Bloodied victims waited in hospital hallways or in the courtyard and many were being treated in the open. A field hospital was being set up.Berlusconi declared a state of emergency, freeing up federal funds to deal with the disaster. He also canceled a visit to Russia to deal with the quake aftermath.Many modern structures in Italy over recent decades have failed to hold up to the rigors of quakes along the country’s mountainous spine, or in coastal cities like Naples. Despite warnings by geologists and architects, some of these buildings have not been retrofitted in terms of seismic safety.Stefania Pezzopane, provincial president of L’Aquila, said residents may have been lulled into complacency because so many smaller quakes had jolted the area, including two or three earlier in the night.“Considering what happened, a bit more concern, more attention might have saved lives,” she said.National officials insisted no quake can ever be predicted and that no evacuation could have been ordered on the basis of the recent jolts.“There is no possibility of making any predictions on earthquakes. This is a fact in the world’s scientific community,” Civil protection chief Guido Bertolaso told reporters.Several weeks ago, an Italian scientist predicted a major quake around L’Aquila, based on concentrations of radon gas around seismically active areas, Reuters reported.Seismologist Gioacchino Giuliani was reported to police for “spreading alarm” and was forced to remove his findings from the Internet. Italy’s Civil Protection Agency reassured locals at the end of March that tremors being felt were “absolutely normal” for a seismic area.

Program Summary
Even today, almost four years after his death, Richard Nixon inspires divided passions in America. Nixon was a self-made man who rose from modest Quaker beginnings in California to the most powerful office in the world. His story is filled with unlikely successes -- a staunch anti-communist, he improved U.S.-Soviet relations, and surprised the world by opening up relations with Communist China. Some credit him with ending the war in Vietnam. But Nixon's career was ultimately undone by his own actions. He abused the power of the office, resigned in humiliation, and tainted the presidency in the process. Admired and reviled, loved and hated, the man and his life continue to fascinate us.

"What the scale tells you is how much the earth..."
Rhina Espaillat
"Weighing In" comes from Where Horizons Go, a collection of poems by Rhina Espaillat, which won the T. S. Eliot prize in 1998. Espaillat was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and moved to the United States in 1939. She writes primarily in English, though her Spanish translations of Robert Frost won her the first Tree at My Window Award from the Robert Frost Foundation in 2004. She lives in Newburyport, Massachusetts, where she has been instrumental in the growth of a rich local literary scene. In response to a question about rhythm and meter Espaillat said "Poetry is a kind of singing, but often about something that doesn't justify singing: that's the tension I hear, and the source of what's moving in a good poem, or much of it, anyway: the fact that under the singing there is something else, barely controlled, with difficulty, but finally controlled." This animation was created by Christopher Dudley Thorpe. The poem is read here by Rhina Espaillat.
