Online Special: President Bush's Address to the Nation Feb. 27, 2001: A report from Capitol Hill on the effort to push President Bush's budget plan. Feb. 26, 2001: Former GOP vice pres. candidate Jack Kemp on the tax cut. Feb. 23, 2001: Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin discusses plans for a tax cut. Feb. 8, 2001: Pres. Bush's plan for a $1.6 trillion tax cut Feb. 8, 2001: Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill on the tax cut plan. Feb.7, 2001: Dennis Hastert, House Speaker, discusses President Bush's tax plan. JIM LEHRER: Now, some analysis of the tax struggle, among other Washington matters, from Shields and Gigot; syndicated columnist Mark Shields, “Wall Street Journal” columnist Paul Gigot. So, what does what Paul Solman just told us, how does that translate into the politics of the struggle that is now under way up on the Hill, with the president, et cetera, sir?MARK SHIELDS: First of all, I mean, it was a jewel of a piece, because it really did explain why we’ve gone from five-year projections to ten-year projections, and that is legislatures, politicians, human beings like to provide pleasure and like to postpone pain. That’s why those sixth-year projections.Jim, when I think about the projections, I’m reminded of just the last time we had a new president — 1993. Bill Clinton came in, he introduced his package, his longest deficits as far as the eye could see. Phil Graham, still a major player, Senator from Texas, said this is a one-way ticket to recession. Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader, an economist, said that’s it, this is going to send unemployment and the deficit through the ceiling. Newt Gingrich said it’s going to double and swell the welfare rolls. Well, that didn’t happen. And it ought to be an exercise in humility, just as Paul pointed out, for all of us. And I think when you’re making ten-year projections, you’re basically saying, you know, this is what I want it to be to some degree. The CBO does a great job, don’t get me wrong.JIM LEHRER: But the question is politically, so the numbers don’t mean anything, it’s basically a political argument about philosophy?MARK SHIELDS: I think they’re serious; I think they’re conscientious, but intervening a single percent in change of spending can change it. A single change in the economy can change it. Now we’re hearing that the economy is cooling, it’s slowing, it’s sputtering, it’s stuttering.JIM LEHRER: Okay. Paul, how would you answer the question about how these numbers, what do they mean then in terms of this struggle?PAUL GIGOT: They don’t mean very much– except… well, I think they’re essentially speculative and even sort of phony basically, not that anybody’s dishonest about it, but — unfortunately they have very real consequences, because both sides use them as weapons in the political fight. And for years, the lack of surpluses were used to block tax cuts.Now that we have big surpluses, they turn the tables and they’re assisting the cause of tax cuts, because it looks like there’s more room for it. So it makes some of the skittish Republicans more likely to vote for them. So there’s no question in my mind, though, right now the surplus estimates have really changed the politics of tax cutting and they’ve changed them in the direction of the Bush tax cut and the Republicans.JIM LEHRER: So the numbers really do mean something?PAUL GIGOT: They have real, real consequences, even though they’re probably not real numbers, they have real political consequences. Absolutely — and that’s, in part, because the Congress wants protection. So they set up – they rig these numbers so they can point to them and say see, we’ve got this, or they do the long projection not just to postpone the pain, but sometimes to stop us before we spend again.JIM LEHRER: So we’ve had one vote that was in the House Ways and Means Committee yesterday, and it was on a party line vote on the president’s plan, or most of the– it’s not all there, but most of it – $900 billion of it is — what does that mean about the future of this whole exercise?MARK SHIELDS: Well, it means a couple of things, Jim. First of all, it means the new chairman of the Committee, Bill Thomas of California, it was an intramural statement, a political statement on his part. What he was basically saying to the Republicans in the Senate is, stiffen your spines. Look, we’re going to pass this over here, we just took the tougher part, that’s the rate reduction without the sweeteners of marriage penalty being removed or the child credit being increased or even the estate tax.We just– we’ve been attacked by the Democrats on tilting to the rich and rewarding the well off, we just passed this, we just stood up and did it. I think that’s the message he wanted, we want to move it quickly, we want to strike while the president is in his honeymoon period. I think that was the political message that was sent. There will never be a vote in the United States Senate on what came out of the Ways and Means Committee tomorrow.JIM LEHRER: We’ll get to that in a minute. How do you read what was happening?PAUL GIGOT: Take advantage of the momentum of the president’s speech, no question about it, that’s the big message, and also try to do it early because you put maximum pressure on the Democrats if you’re making this argument that you need a tax cut to stimulate the economy, you do it now when the economy looks a little soft — and hope that that sells. Unfortunately, the bill that they passed only has a lot of the tax cuts– only one of the tax rates retroactive to January 1 of this year, so I think they undercut their own argument.JIM LEHRER: About helping stimulate the economy.PAUL GIGOT: Right, but that’s the political message they want to send. I think a better tax cut would have been a better way to back that message up, but anyway, that’s why they did it right now.JIM LEHRER: Does it mean anything? Is it going to have any effect?PAUL GIGOT: Sure, it’s going to have, I think — they’re going to vote on it in the House next week, at least they plan to. It will probably pass the House. Remember, tax bills have to start in the Ways and Means Committee in the House before the Senate can do anything under the Constitution. So this is trying to build some momentum so some of those weak-kneed Republicans and moderate Democrats in the Senate will see that you can pass tax cuts and get the momentum.JIM LEHRER: Does it also set a pattern that this is definitely not a bipartisan issue?MARK SHIELDS: I think that was fairly visible yesterday. I think what he has done, what Bill Thomas has done, and he’s an effective legislator, I do not underestimate him, but he has united the Democrats. I will be willing to bet right now there will be fewer than a dozen Democrats voting for a popular president’s popular tax cut next week. That’s a big turnaround from 20 years ago when the last Republican president came in with a big tax cut, Ronald Reagan. Who were the ones who were the initial defectors? They were all the southern conservative Democrats. They are the most staunch and stalwart in opposition to this.PAUL GIGOT: Most of those are Republicans, now, Jim.MARK SHIELDS: You’re talking about the blue dog Democrats, the blue dog Democrats — the Gene Taylors, the Charlie Stenholms.PAUL GIGOT: There are a lot fewer of those guys was my point.MARK SHIELDS: Alan Boyd — I agree there are. In 1991 they turned out to be turncoats, Phil Graham and Shelby among them.JIM LEHRER: A lot of people are not as informed as you two, as we go through this debate over… we’ve heard the numbers, we’ve heard what Greenspan said today, we just heard what Paul said from the CBO, et cetera. The politics of this, lay out what you think is truly at the heart of the argument between the Democrats and the Republicans for us to watch as this thing unfolds.PAUL GIGOT: Well, it’s a philosophical argument about the size of government. What you want to do with the surpluses, do you want to spend it or do you want to return it to the people, that’s I think the core part of the argument more than anything else. I really do.JIM LEHRER: And the rest of it is just around that.PAUL GIGOT: Yeah, I think ultimately…JIM LEHRER: Would that mean then that the moderates in the middle who don’t feel that strongly philosophically either way are going to resolve it?PAUL GIGOT: They’re going to move with the politics. I think the politics are heavily on the side of a new president in this case. Chairman Greenspan made that a lot easier with his statements supporting tax cuts in general, and also taking, I think… going a long way to taking the debt reduction argument off the table.Bill Clinton did a great job of turning into Bob Dole as the old accountant Republican, root canal Republican and saying look we have to pay down the debt first. What Greenspan said is look, we’re paying it down so fast already that within a few years we’re going to be piling up, we’re not going to be able to reduce any debt in any one year, because there’s not going to be enough to reduce that matures in any one year. The surpluses will be larger. So the government will then accumulate assets, and he’s saying we don’t want to do that, so better now get on a glide path of lower revenues. And that’s been a big help to tax cutters in the last couple of weeks.JIM LEHRER: Do you agree first of all – we’ll come back to my question – do you agree that Greenspan is really helping the president?MARK SHIELDS: Greenspan has helped the last two presidents. Greenspan really gave support to Bill Clinton for his tax increase in 1993 as part of deficit reduction, and he’s helped George W. Bush, there’s no question about that.JIM LEHRER: Draw a simple line where you see the argument here.MARK SHIELDS: I think the argument is made, first of all, Jim, we’re doing this in the dark. I mean, it is… the Congress has lost, its own rule. You have a budget. What George Bush did the other night in his presidential speech was to lay out a lot of pleasure, a tax cut and spending increases. We know there’s going to be spending cuts. There’s absolutely no indication of where those spending cuts will going to be.And what Democrats and some Republicans are saying we have to have a budget first before we can do that. The president agreed with that before he appeared before the House Democratic caucus meeting. He said yes, we should have a budget before we have a tax cut. That’s one. The second is over the next ten years, the $555 billion of the tax cut – and the numbers are already there — will go to the top 1 percent, which is more than the president talks about in spending increases for all prescription drugs, all education, all health care — research, all national defense increases. So that’s what we’re really talking.PAUL GIGOT: The difference, there aren’t going to be budget cuts of the kind Mark talks about. The cuts… this is the thing that surplus has allowed Bush to do. He’s allowed to increase spending by 4 percent. You don’t give the Democrats the opening and say cuts in school lunches. He proposed a reduction in transportation because they’ve already spent three or four years building a lot of bridges and roads. You don’t need to have the big increase. But this is the big difference in the debate, the surpluses mean you don’t have to do that tight of budgeting and everybody can get something.JIM LEHRER: So it’s not as much about priorities as it used to be, it’s just how to– no?MARK SHIELDS: I don’t think there’s any question that the spending caps worked to a considerable degree in the past because of the deficits. I think once the deficits are removed, I think spending will increase dramatically. But the third factor, you know, they talk about cold showers and root canal work. But, I mean, people want the debt paid down, Jim. Last year in debt payment, interest on the national debt last year, we paid more than we paid for all our veterans, all our FBI, all our national parks, all our senior citizens.JIM LEHRER: And how do the Republicans respond to this?PAUL GIGOT: We’re already paying it down so fast, they’re going to pay off $2 trillion. It’s going away. You don’t really have to worry about it. The other thing about the class warfare argument, he talks about the rich, look, it really doesn’t matter, because, you know, a lot of the tax cut is going proportionately to lower and middle class people — not in dollar terms, but proportional terms. They don’t pay as much– they’re getting a bigger tax cut proportionately than the rich are.JIM LEHRER: Well, I just want to thank you both for clearing this up. Thank you both.

The Ombudsman Column
Ombudsman's Mailbag
By Michael Getler
May 17, 2007
Welcome to another Ombudsman's Mailbag. This one is very long, so here's a guide to what's in it so you can pick, choose, skim, scan or devour the whole thing.
The length is mostly because there were hundreds of e-mails about PBS's two-part, four-hour documentary, "The Mormons," that aired early this month. To provide just a representative sample requires a fair amount of space.
In last week's ombudsman column, which was on another subject, I mentioned "The Mormons" only in passing, saying that, "As a viewer, I found it very informative and fair in capturing a complex faith." Some viewers who were critical of the program, and were also critical of my judgment, said that I "only felt it was balanced because he does not know what we believe," as one viewer put it, or "How would you know if it was fair?" as another said.
Those are fair points, and that's why I said I was reacting as a viewer. I'm not well informed about Mormonism, but I do have what I hope is a fairly well-tuned ear for bias and unfairness and what I was going on was my overall impression that this was a serious and honest attempt to inform people like me and, as PBS likes to say, "viewers like you." Also, both of Utah's major newspapers, the Deseret Morning News and the Salt Lake Tribune had printed columns favorable to the series and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had said, in a statement, that: "At a time when significant media and public attention is being turned to" the church, "and when news media is so often accused of superficiality in its coverage of religion, this serious treatment of a serious subject is a welcome change. But even four hours and numerous interviews," the statement added, "can't cover everything. No doubt, some Church members will feel essentials were left out."
Moyers May Need a Dedicated Ombudsman
There is also a lot more mail about the latest "Bill Moyers Journal." Moyers is now back on PBS with his "Journal" every Friday and I'm beginning to think that PBS may need a separate ombudsman just to deal with the weekly mail praising or pillorying this lightning rod/icon.
The Ombudsman's Column of May 4 dealt with Moyers' initial offering, actually a special on "Buying the War." And, by the way, the ombudsman at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Ken Bode, also wrote a column about this first new Moyers special that is very much worth reading and that included a very good point that I wish I had also made.
Bode wrote this: "The reason this examination of the failings of the mainstream press is a flawed effort is simply that Mr. Moyers did not examine his own network, PBS, and particularly its flagship news show, The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer with the same scrutiny as the rest of the media, In an otherwise admirable and courageous documentary, how would Moyers have judged The NewsHour's coverage of the run-up to the war? Would he have found the same penetrating courage of the Knight-Ridder reporting, or the compliant complicity of the majority of the mainstream media? More important: Why was The NewsHour left out of his analysis?"
I'm not offering any detailed assessment of last week's follow-on offering, but these thoughts come to mind.
Moyers clearly has huge numbers of fans among PBS viewers, and they depend on his reporting, analysis and commentary. He clearly also has lots of critics who view him as a relentless Bush-basher. In last week's column I described him as "definitely a force, an original, a hard-to-categorize person of many interests and talents." This week's mailbag brought more criticism along those lines. Moyers devoted two segments of the May 11 "Journal" to aspects of the war in Iraq.
One involved an interview with a professor at New York University, Marilyn B. Young, who is a historian and author. It was about a recent interview on PBS's Charlie Rose show with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Moyers introduced the segment by saying that Rice's "language seemed as removed from reality, as it was four years ago before all the blood and chaos that has followed America's invasion." A concluding segment dealt with "the costs of this war," an accounting of the financial and human toll so far.
Rice had said some things on Charlie Rose that would, indeed, make anyone who has followed the war closely, sit up and say "What?" She said that she thought America's credibility remains strong, that the U.S. is in Iraq because the Iraqi government asked us to be there, and that it wasn't just American intelligence that thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction but that the UN also thought he had them.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie
Moyers didn't say it, but the impression was that he didn't think his colleague Charlie Rose had challenged Rice sufficiently so Young was brought in and she hammered away. Now, there is no doubt that this segment was set up to hammer away, and if you are a Bush administration supporter you are not going to like it and it will seem unfair. On the other hand, nobody else in the press seems to be doing much these days in terms of fact-checking and challenging administration statements in a prominent, detailed and timely fashion and, in my view, Moyers is providing a public service because these contradictory statements need to be heard because war is a factual and not a partisan matter. The administration gets to make its case virtually whenever it wants to.
Young, however, I thought fumbled slightly in one of her counter-attacks against Rice's point that even the UN believed the WMD claims. Young cited Hans Blix, the chief of the UN inspection effort, as "quite persuaded" that "there were no weapons of mass destruction." In fact, Blix was cautious right up to the war, reporting only what he called "cautious formulations." Based on inspections that had been carried out thus far, he said in March 2003, no evidence of underground or mobile facilities for chemical or biological weapons had been found.
It was actually Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, whose public report at the same time proved to be much more conclusive and vastly more accurate than that of the Bush administration. It was also more powerful because it dealt directly with the administration campaign to have the public perceive the Iraq threat as a nuclear "mushroom cloud." ElBaradei said the IAEA inspectors had found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapon program in Iraq, no indication that Iraq had attempted to import uranium since 1990, and no indication that imported aluminum tubes or special magnets were for centrifuges to make atomic weapons.
As for the cost of the war, that, too, as I see it, is something that is not often pulled together prominently for the public by news organizations. The military and civilian killed and wounded frequently make the nightly news shows but mostly in incremental coverage, and the financial cost is rarely focused on. So here, too, I view Moyers focus on this as a public service whether or not it is, or is viewed as, partisan. These are real numbers. That is, except one, where I thought the program also stumbled.
In his list of horrors, Moyers says it's been difficult to get an accurate count of the dead and wounded among Iraqi civilians. That's true. But then Moyers goes on to say, "estimates range up to three-quarters of a million killed." That is a reference to a highly controversial estimate last fall made by a team of U.S. and Iraqi epidemiologists. It was produced by Iraqis interviewing residents during a random sampling of households in the country. It was more than 10 times higher than estimates made by the widely used, British-based Iraq Body Count research group. Whatever the actual figure, it is no doubt high. But using only this one estimate — which has been widely challenged and is so at odds with other accounts — needlessly weakened the credibility of the segment, in my view.
Some other viewers wrote to complain about film clips of Rice statements going unchallenged on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, and also about filmed comments by White House spokesman Tony Snow on April 30 claiming that "there's been no attempt to try to link Saddam to September 11th." Vice President Cheney has tried many times to make that link publicly and it has been implied on many other occasions by many officials. One of them was the "Mission Accomplished" speech by President Bush on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003, in which he said, "The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on Sept. 11, 2001 — and still goes on . . . The liberation of Iraq . . . removed an ally of al Qaeda." In August 2003 a Washington Post poll reported that almost 7 out of 10 Americans thought it likely that Saddam was involved in the attacks. Now, how do you think they got that impression?
The Mailbag Starts Here; First, 'The Mormons'
I was disappointed in the PBS broadcast of "The Mormons." I thought it reflected poorly on your standards of conduct to have fair and balanced productions. The production was skewed by a heavy reliance of non-Mormon or non-practicing Mormon interviewees or so called "experts." I have found in studying other religions that I gain a better understanding asking a member of that faith about his or her beliefs than asking a nonbeliever to tell me their version of the story. I don't mind hearing the critics' point of view, but it should be balanced, not a 10 to 1 ratio of a critic's disbelief to a Mormon's view. I thought that was basic journalism skills and integrity. Perhaps some of the producers at PBS should take a refresher course in what it means to be "fair and balanced."
W. N., Kennewick, WA
The documentary, "The Mormons," which aired on PBS was such an imbalanced and skewed presentation it was sickening. PBS has done a serious disservice to the viewing public, to the millions of members of the LDS church, and to the reputation of PBS. Viewers were left with erroneous and false impressions about the Latter-day Saint people, and, PBS is directly responsible for that.
Your words: "As a viewer, I found it very informative and fair in capturing a complex faith." Of course it was informative. Any 4-hour documentary would be informative, but how would you know if it was fair? As ombudsman, you review commentary and criticism from viewers and seek to ensure that PBS upholds its own STANDARDS OF EDITORIAL INTEGRITY. You have some work to do.
Yakima, WA
I was greatly disappointed in the very unbalanced and weird portrayal of our faith recently on PBS. ("The Mormons") To have 90% of the time (their opinions) of the broadcast given to folks (including many who had axes apparently to grind, anti-Mormons etc.) who misrepresented the facts about our church and our true history, showed a huge lack of integrity/fairness on the producer's part.
Why PBS would do this to a Church and people who strive so hard to serve their fellowman is truly amazing to me. I know I will not be contributing to the station in the future. I'm sure others of the 2nd largest Church in California will feel the same way about that now. What was done was not only unethical but a bad business move on PBS's part. I hope you can pass this on to PBS. All the best to you though, and thanks for listening.
Dave Thompson, Long Beach, CA
I have been an avid watcher of PBS through the years. I watched the PBS Frontline program, "The Mormons" on April 30. I am a practicing member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was not expecting a totally rosy picture of the church in which I belong as I am aware of the controversies that were presented; however, I was expecting a fair and balanced view of who the Mormons are. The program clearly presented a biased view of Mormon history. I have read and studied Mormon history from both sides of the fence. The amount of time focused on the Mountain Meadows Massacre and polygamy, without a fair amount of time given for a rebuttal or viewpoint was really unfair and a cheap shot. Not knowing a lot of the background of many of your programs, I now question the integrity of your program. Colleyville, TX
You missed the mark again! In your "Old Business" introduction you said there was a "big write in campaign" from those who did not like the showing of "The Mormons." There were no write-in campaigns going on. (Ombudsman's note: http://www.mormonapologetics.org/index.php?showtopic=24202) We wrote our feelings because of the misconceptions you aired about our religion. The Church nor anyone in it encouraged us to write to you guys. Once again you distorted the truth. Our church does not have campaigns going on. Mormonism is not a "complex religion." It is complex to the world because the world cannot see spiritual things through eyes. We still believe in morality in a world that is sinking in immorality. That's why there are "campaigns" against the Mormons. Our Church just doesn't stoop to the world's definition of what's acceptable and what's not. We don't change our values as the world keeps getting more and more corrupt. I still say you are biased and that it was a very politically oriented program. The presidential debates viewed shortly after, my your timing was perfect to target Mitt Romney by deceiving the public by showing the distorted views of what you perceive as truth. I just can't trust the "journalism" that PBS airs from now on, simply because you guys can't separate truth from fiction.

My husband and I are long time viewers and supporters of PBS, especially such programs as Frontline. However, I can't tell you how disappointed and dismayed we were at the Frontline/American Experience program on the Mormons. In our opinion, this program not only did not maintain an objective approach to the subject, but appeared to us to be a commercial for Mitt Romney for president.
Our concern about the program started when the list of contributors concluded with "others," and if you wanted to know who the others were, you could contact PBS. No contact address was given for PBS. I e-mailed Frontline requesting the list of "others," but they never responded. So — who were these others? Were they so numerous that they couldn't be listed? And why? Were these contributors solicited? How? It is easy to conclude that there could have been an effort by the Mormon church to "encourage" members to contribute to help spread the word about Mitt Romney and his candidacy.
A second question we had was why this program was being shown when there have already been other PBS programs examining the Mormons? The only difference that we noted was that this program included a segment devoted to Romney. Further, if we remember correctly, the program ended with a smiling Romney going to church. In that regard, why was Romney only shown smiling and greeting people? He was governor of Massachusetts so why wasn't he shown in that role instead of the role of a candidate?
The program featured the well known controversies about polygamy and the denial of the priesthood to black males. Why didn't it include the more cultish aspects such as the temple outfits that the males wear and the secret underwear that both sexes wear as a recent Religion and Ethics Newsweekly program did? Because voters might be concerned about other secret practices that the Mormons engage in?
Last, the timing of the program is also suspect being shown right prior to the Republican presidential debates and Romney's appearances on some TV shows as well as his address to Pat Robertson's Regent University.

I am a financial contributor to PBS as well as a long time member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I watched both nights of this program and feel that it was reasonably fair to the church. I recognize that the LDS church as always been controversial and has a history of bad press. So, a "thank you" should go to those who produced the segments for their reasonable treatment of the church and its people.
Ken Spencer, Blackfoot, ID
First, I wanted to thank you for your recent 2-part documentary on the Mormons. In many ways it was an interesting introduction to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ and some of its more controversial past. However, I do not think the documentary fulfilled its mission of encouraging understanding. Instead, it seemed more to be a dissection of its history and teachings. Even more strange was that instead of presenting pictures and images of God and Joseph Smith familiar to Latter-Day Saint homes and chapels, there were dark images, and even darker music. If the purpose of the program was to introduce the audience to some of the stranger aspects of historical Mormonism (or at least make it sound strange) then the program was excellent. I thought it was balanced (for the most part) between believers and non-believers. On the other hand, if the purpose was (as was implied) to build understanding, I am at a loss why *opponents* of Mormonism were given such a vocal presence.
Pace Nielsen, Iowa City, IA
I found the "Mormons" documentary to be the best ever representation of Mormonism. In four hours one gets a taste of all aspects of the religion — the highs, the lows, etc. Sure the fanatics on both extremes will be mad but the documentary is not trying to show only their perspective but every perspective connected with Mormonism. It pulled this off remarkably well and balanced in my opinion. There certainly could have been a more harsh attack as advocated by critics (for example, where was the Book of Abraham?) or the always sought after faithful history to pacify the orthodoxy. My hat goes off to PBS and Helen Whitney.
Justin Anderson, Calgary, AB
I enjoyed the program "The Mormons" presented this week, and was impressed with most of the quality of the work. There was one fatal error presented at the very beginning of the film, and that is Joseph Smith is not the "Alpha and Omega" of the Mormon faith. Jesus Christ is the "Alpha and Omega" of our faith. Joseph Smith was a mortal like you and me, and subject to error, but Jesus Christ is God. He is the Lord we put our faith in. That's very important, and I wish the producer of the program would have presented this truth more clearly. Thank you for all the good programs that come from PBS.
Steve Evans, Salt Lake City, UT
I was quite astonished by The Mormons program. It seemed to be an effort toward mainstreaming this cult by minimizing their kind of thinking that is antithetical to fundamental American beliefs. There's a reason why the populace is suspicious of Mormons — their Nazi-like rigidity with its strict adherence to the authoritarian 'father'; the abolition of "unhappiness" by church fiat; the brainwashing of children; the squelching of dissent; and the devaluation of un-married women. None of these aberrations were covered with any weight in your program.
Rosemary Scharrenbroich, Brooklyn, NY
I enjoyed the presentation on the Mormons, but the music that accompanied the narrative seemed spooky, odd and irritating. It made me question the intents of the program in trying to sway the audience's perception of the Mormons by the use of such odd music. I do enjoy learning about different religions and I look forward to learning about other religions in the future. With so much fighting and war being waged in the name of religion, it behooves us to learn of people's beliefs. Keep up the good work in providing educational programming.
Kandee McKellar, Phoenix, AZ
I am writing to thank you for the outstanding documentary "The Mormons" recently broadcast on PBS. I am a devout Mormon convert of 20 years and was extremely pleased with the balanced presentation of our history and faith, warts and all. It is rare to find a treatment of our religion that isn't so skewed as to come across as either an attack ad or a public relations campaign. PBS struck a fine balance that will be of great value both within and outside the membership of the LDS Church. Thank you again.
Darin Stewart, Portland, OR
It would have been helpful and would have added to the journalistic integrity of this program if the background of the speakers would have been made clear. I am a member of the LDS church so my opinion will be biased, even though I attempted to view the program with an open mind. Several of the speakers have deep anti-Mormon roots. It does not mean that the facts they presented may not have been true. However, in this type of documentary the background and perspective of the speakers — whether for or against the LDS Church — were important to the presentation.
Denver, CO
Your recent program on "Mormons" was far too biased in a negative sense. If you are looking for objectivity, why are you including many ex-communicated Mormons in your interviews, who are obviously offended by the church's actions? All Mormons could claim to be "Historians" for the religion, as they are all well versed in it. You also took comments that were perpetrated to be "present day" practices in the Temple, which are blatantly false. Your piece on polygamy included an excessive amount of "fundamentalist Mormons" who practice polygamy, which in fact is not at all a part of Mormonism today, but instead is a group of apostates who practice polygamy. As Gordon B. Hinckley said, there is no such thing as a "fundamentalist Mormon." Instead of objectivity, you have gone to the practice of "sensationalism," and this is nothing more than "Yellow Journalism." The interesting conclusion is that this negative press will in fact increase the number of people who will eventually become Mormons, because the vast missionary force will have it to discuss with the people they meet, and will often have the opportunity to straighten the crooked that was presented in your program.
James Melby, Martinsburg, WV
First of all I am a practicing Mormon. I found your documentary a fair attempt by a journalist to try to get all views of Mormonism from believers, disgruntled non-practicing Mormons, and supposed theologians, etc. I still believe in my heart, if I want to know the truth of anyone's religion, I would not go to those who became disenchanted with the religion. I would find the most faithful member of that church and inquire about their beliefs.
St. George, UT
The documentary on the Mormons was quite thorough and over all highly enjoyable. However I found some of the comments were a might confused. For example, the documentary stated there was a "new" Book of Mormon printed with a different title that now included Christ in an effort to mainstream the book. To say that it was a "new" book gives the connotations that it was entirely rewritten to make it more "acceptable" when in fact the only thing that changed was the title. And it seemed the title was only changed to clear-up any misunderstanding that the book wasn't about Christ.
Eliza S., Las Vegas, NV
As a Mormon I enjoyed your recent show "The Mormons." Obviously with the limited amount of time available to you it was extremely difficult to portray the full story of the church. Having said that, I was pleased with your work. I know you will receive e-mails from those who will complain about this and that. I always return to what my father used to say: "Some people would complain if they were hung with a new rope." Thanks for a great job.
Dallas, TX
Having lived in Utah two summers as an adolescent, & then for fifteen years as a Christian pastor, I was surprised by the perspective that a public television station seemed to advocate. I would not conclude that the presentation was neutral or unbiased. Far from that, it seemed that the creators were either LDS or, at least LDS sympathizers. Please don't misunderstand; I'm not suggesting that the Mormons don't need any sympathy. They were my neighbors & friends for a decade and a half. I shared with many of them their frustrations and misgivings about the claims of Mormonism. The bottom line is this: Mormonism differs from Biblical/Historic Christianity. While your documentary painted the picture from an LDS point of view, quoting their doctrinal conclusions & spiritual interpretations, an honest LDS person (and most of them are) will admit that they differ and in fact disagree with Christianity in four basic categories. Each of these categories were overlooked in your presentation: Biblical Authority (Where do you get your authority?) The Nature of God (Who is God?) The Doctrine of Christ (Who is Jesus Christ & what did He do?) The Plan of Salvation (How is an individual saved?). My conclusion is that the presentation was a good argument for Mormonism, rather than an objective view.
Jim Schaedler, Orange, CA
I would like to compliment PBS on its recent coverage of Mormons. Being a devout Mormon myself I was a bit worried about how the Mormons would be portrayed on the show. After having watched it, I can honestly say that it was as fair a portrayal of Mormons as I ever could have expected. I realize that often Mormons, including myself, have an idealistic view, at times, of how our own history has unfolded. So, I was not expecting every instant to be a feel-good-pat-on-the-back kind of instant. However, I also realize that sometimes those outside a particular religion like to focus on those aspects of the religion that are 'interesting' or could be 'ratings-grabbers'. While there was coverage of the 'interesting' during the show, I don't feel there was an inordinate amount of it. Maineville, OH
It is my hope that Mr. Michael Getler was on vacation during the review of this supposed documentary "The Mormons," as his job description is 'to ensure that PBS upholds its own standards of editorial integrity.' Furthermore, I suspect PBS has received a plethora of emails regarding the misconstrued information of the show, not to mention its negative slant, so I will not cite them now, but rather make this point. When it comes to best practices in Public Broadcasting equal sided and accurate information is the minimum that the American public can expect. Today's television medium is littered with agenda driven transmission, PBS must be different otherwise I see no need for its existence. Simply put, I have great concern for the validity of any of PBS's programming, based on what was viewed last night.
J. Ryan Bevan, Phoenix, AZ
Here's Moyers, Again
Your statement, "All's well that ends well" is disturbingly similar to "the ends justify the means." Mr. Moyers is clearly, even if you can justify it to yourself, advocating for liberal views consistently in his programs. Furthermore, your statement that (paraphrasing) there is no shortage of the other views in the media, is beside the point isn't it . . . we are talking about Public television aren't we? Tonight I viewed another of his programs wherein he interviews a like-minded "authority" on the Vietnam war and Iraq and uses his air time to vilify C. Rice and Bush. He and his "guests" busy themselves making smug statements reflecting the current liberal conventional wisdom and support these with half-truths and out-of-context observations. I continue to be disappointed with PBS and its Ombudsman. When and to whom will PBS provide equal airtime on the Public airwaves to rebut Mr. Moyers' spurious claims?
D. Hall, Vista, CA
So Moyers is a "LIBERAL"! LIBERAL — Encarta: English (North America)
1. Broad minded: Tolerant of different views and standards of behavior in others.
2. Progressive politically or socially: Politics favoring gradual reform, especially political reforms that extend democracy, distribute wealth more evenly, and protect the personal freedom of the individual.
3. Generous: Generous with money, time, or some other asset.
4. Generous in quantity: Large in size or amount.
5. Not literal: Language not limited to the literal meaning in translation or interpretation.
6. Culturally oriented arts concerned with general cultural matters and broadening of the mind rather than professional or technical study
Yep, sure sounds like Moyers. Also sounds like a Jew that lived about 2000 years ago!

What is it with Bill Moyers and his bashing of everything President Bush does or his administration. What a liberal slanted program you air on PBS. Is this where my taxpayer money goes to? It seems the only programs aired on PBS are slanted to the left. Every time I try to see something educational on PBS, all I see is liberal programs and views. I suggest PBS start balancing their station programming and for you to start cutting back on these liberal sided programs on PBS. Please tell me if you can, what conservative programs, commentators and journalists do you have on PBS. The list is probably non-existent. I suggest you really take a good look at Mr. Moyers and his programs. This man is a die hard liberal and all of his points of views. What a way to spread liberal propaganda. My tax money at work.
E. Perez, Miami, FL
How can you allow Bill Moyers' blatantly biased point of view to go out over the airwaves. It is not journalism, it is filled with half truths and weird conclusions that only a far left nut could come up with. These are my tax dollars being used to promote a point of view that I cannot tolerate. How about some editorial objectivity in what is going out over the airwaves? Should be your editor's job, not the government's.
Tom Leclaire, Battlefield, MO
My spouse and I are glad Bill Moyers is back on PBS. We need to enlarge the orbit of political discussion, and he's the right person for the job.
Otto Sotnak, Aitkin, MN
Once again I cannot believe the pure audacity of PBS to let the far left counter culture use its publicly funded national infrastructure to broadcast another political hit piece. In the past I have sent you emails stating how much I love many of the shows that PBS runs, but cannot get myself to ever again support PBS as long as it is willing to let political hacks like Bill Moyers use it to try and advance his and his funders' far left beliefs. The last pile of garbage of his you just aired was even more biased than previous so called "documentaries" he has put together using political left money, there was absolutely no balance, none whatsoever which is ironic considering the jist of his "documentary" was about conservative bias in the media leading up to the Iraq war. As much as I think Moyers is a kook, I do not blame him for doing what he feels necessary to try and convince other Americans that the war in Iraq was ill conceived, my anger is with PBS using my taxes to give him this powerful forum to do it.
Keith Meyer, Little Chute, WI
I was very impressed by Bill Moyers' program on telling the truth about Iraq and the role the news media played. I was also scared to death. I now believe nothing of what I'm told or read and question everything. It is not just this administration that I now hold responsible. And to know that there were people out there that had serious concerns and we the public heard little or none of it. I remember listening to Scott Ritter talk. He was the first to make me question what was happening. Interesting, I don't hear anything about him now. Again thank you I just wish something like this program had happened years ago.
Grace Flight, Bethel, CT
The Bill Moyers' program on the role of the press as cheerleader for the war was GREAT. Now that's professional journalism. I grew up listening to the great ones — Murrow, Pyle, etc. Very few of those courageous journalists around in this age. With the exception of a few, the 4th estate has become the 5th column. Please thank Mr. Moyers for his excellent and very brave program. I look forward to many more.
Mary Macvicar, Columbus, OH
I wanted to welcome Mr. Moyers back to PBS and to congratulate you on your first Journal installment. It was an excellent piece. I watched it with a few friends who have heard me making the same critiques of the shameful coverage in the lead up to and the aftermath of the Iraq war. It was good to have some vindication on PBS. I have two criticisms of the piece however.
First, while the piece was obviously focusing for the most part on journalists who were complicit in the dissemination of misinformation (due to intent or laziness or blind patriotism), I thought Moyers could have painted a more accurate picture of pre-war coverage by featuring more of the journalists who got the story right, like Amy Goodman of Democracy Now, Jeff Cohen (founder of FAIR and staffer of FOX and MSNBC), as well as myriad writers of the Nation and broadcasters on the independent Pacifica network.
My second critique of the piece is that it didn't spend hardly any time focusing on NPR's and PBS' own failures in the lead up. I was so horrified by the rightward shift of the NewsHour during the last few years starting with the war coverage, that I've stopped listening to it or watching it. And All Things Considered was hardly any better in the lead up to the War, and hasn't much improved. Independent stations within the NPR and PBS affiliate structure have often proved oases of good coverage in a desert of corporate media distractions, but the national programming has often been abysmal. A FAIR study of NewsHour programming on the war found a 3:1 bias in favor of pro-war, pro-administration positions held by guests. Considering that PBS/NPR/CPB are supposed to be the standard for unbiased coverage, their major failings have yet to be adequately exposed. I think the piece's failure to spend any real time on that issue represents a major oversight.
Matthew Isles, Oakland, CA
I would like to thank PBS for bringing Bill Moyers back and also for airing the special about the lies and the media's failure in questioning the administration. It was journalism at its best. I am sure Mr. Moyers is coming under attack from the right but I would like to convey that many people watched his special and are thankful he exposed what many of us have feared for years. I look forward to seeing many more Journals.
Anne Jacobs, Pomona, CA
I was watching Bill Moyers' review of the Iraq war. Although I often disagree with Moyers, tonight I found myself agreeing with him completely. But intuitively, based on having watched him for many years, I knew that this edition of his Journal would have little impact.
Bill Moyers is an example of a person who believes passionately in the issues for which he is an advocate. So am I. We believe that the truth of what we say will make it compelling and convincing. In fact, and in practice, that passion and conviction dilutes and ultimately renders impotent our efforts to recruit others.
In another story immediately following Moyers (on the NOW program), the journalist reported on a whistle-blower who filed a lawsuit against Kerr-McGee and won. The story included a statement: Kerr-McGee declined our request for an interview and sent a written statement instead (words to that effect). This was what often passes for "fair and balanced reporting," and I'm afraid that in truth, it is inadequate.
On paper, if the offer is made to allow the target of a story to respond and they decline, it satisfies the theory of that principle. In fact, as a critical thinker, I believe it is unrealistic to think that a company, in this case the subject of what amounts to an expose, should have any expectation that their response will be presented fairly.
My point: PBS needs to do more of substance to insure that the other side of these stories is presented. It's not enough for the people making the documentary to offer the target an opportunity to respond. If I'm the target, why would I bother responding when I know that my response is going to be edited and filtered by a group of people who have already decided I'm guilty?
Ted Thomas, Portland, OR
Does the Left Control, or the Right Go Unchallenged?
Why does the left so pervasively control PBS? — Well, maybe because they were there first, and made sure that only those that agreed with their ideology were hired, which led to a consistent and pervasive bias in favor of everything to the left.
But things have changed — when PBS first started up, the Democrats and Republicans were all part of the "establishment," although the Democrats were ALWAYS preferable to the Republicans, and the programming at PBS reflected that. Now to be left is to be Democrat as well, so that PBS has become one long campaign commercial, whose function is to make and promote Democrats, or better yet to criticize Republicans.
And you as ombudsman, what is your role? Why to make a small amount of noise when things get egregious but not enough to rock the boat, or to be on record. Of course, in order to be in your position you need the ethics of a snake oil salesman, as you exist solely to maintain the status quo.
But I ask again — WHY is PBS to the left of everything? Why can't a single dollar in CPB grant money be spent on something with a conservative bias for chrissake? That question was asked by a liberal friend of mine who questioned why when it came to public broadcasting all the money was for the left and not a dime for anything to the right. Why? Why can't it be 50/50 i.e. balanced like Congress intended?
Well, sooner or later the pendulum will swing again, and when that time comes, nothing will save PBS. And like I said, as Ombudsman, you're the window dressing so that PBS can say "look we have an ombudsman and gee whiz once or twice he even said we went too far." A situation guaranteed to make you cynical about public broadcasting, and its entrenched interests.
B. Samuel Davis, Morristown, NJ
I watch the NewsHour almost every night, and count on it for in-depth reporting. Tonight April 30, on a segment on George Tenet, the NewsHour showed clips of comments of Tony Snow and Condi Rice. Each of them lied. Rice said that even the United Nations thought there were WMD. That is false. The UN inspectors found no WMD and Hans Blix thought there were none. The Administration kicked the inspectors out and invaded. Snow said that the Administration never linked Saddam and 9/11. That is simply false. Cheney on numerous occasions publicly linked them. What bothered me about your coverage is that you made no effort to point out these lies, simply letting them stand as if they were the truth. Where is your journalistic integrity? Where is the responsibility to speak truth to power? The failure to hold Administration figures accountable for what they say is how we got into this mess. I was very disappointed in your failure to point this out.
Howard Masur, Providence, IL
It is noteworthy that you respond at great length to Bechtel criticism re Katrina trailers but ignore such as my critique of the Jim Lehrer/Charlie Rose good-ole-boy treatment of (former CIA Director George)Tenet.
That Lehrer/Rose pitched soft balls as they helped peddle Tenet's book is made clear by commentary of those with direct knowledge of the workings of the intelligence community. There is, for example, this from ex-DIA official, Pat Lang, who periodically appears on the NewsHour:
Lang says Tenet "is a spoiled child who, in his own mind, is never to blame for anything, never really takes responsibility for his failures of judgment and action, and spins, and spins and spins. George's "admissions" of responsibility are always carefully couched in words that do not actually say things like, "I was wrong," "I failed," "The war was a mistake," "I failed in what I did not do to stop this oncoming disaster." He quibbles. Quibbling is not acceptable in an intelligence officer, certainly not in the BOSS intelligence officer. I wonder if the Society of Jesus is happy when Tenet cites the principles that he thinks they taught him as justification for his way of doing things."
Many people share the view that the PBS treatment of Tenet ill-serves the public. Such treatment of Tenet is in line with the longstanding proclivity of Lehrer and Rose to not probe in depth in discussions with high government officials their responsibility for the Iraq debacle.
For example, neither Lehrer nor Rose asked Tenet why he stood by as Bush, Cheney, Powell et al. said the now famous aluminum tubes as destined for uranium enrichment centrifuges when the government's centrifuge experts at the Department of Energy believed it very unlikely that this was their purpose.
Similarly, in neither interview was Tenet asked his response to charges of dereliction put forth by Tyler Drumheller, a former top CIA official in Europe. Drumheller describes how Tenet and his deputy, John McLaughlin, did not correct erroneous assertions by Bush, Cheney, Powell et al. about bioweapons trailers. Such assertions grew from statements made by a single source, Curveball, who was considered not reliable by intelligence agency officers. It is important to hear directly from Tenet his response to Drumheller whose damning allegations have been left dangling.
Henry Myers, Peaks Island, ME
I am puzzled and disappointed at the on-going absence of coverage of Alberto Gonzales and House and Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. When The NewsHour skipped coverage of the testimony of James Comey before the House Committee on May 3rd, it seemed like a matter of inevitable editorial choices, but when Comey's shocking testimony from this morning was passed over, it seemed more like intentional suppression of the news. It's hard to understand an editorial policy that would choose a Jerry Falwell retrospective over breaking news.
Mary Collins, Corvallis, OR
Falwell Coverage: Too One-Sided?
I found your coverage of Jerry Falwell's death to be terribly one-sided . . . 2 religious right commentators! . . . history will show that this man was stupid, bigoted and hateful . . . let me remind you of some of his quotes . . . the fact you didn't bring these up shows us the right slant that has poisoned PBS . . .
On Sept. 11: "The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way — all of them who have tried to secularize America — I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.'"
On AIDS: "AIDS is the wrath of a just God against homosexuals."
On public education: "I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again, and Christians will be running them."
On the separation of church and state: "There is no separation of church and state."
On feminists: "I listen to feminists and all these radical gals . . . These women just need a man in the house. That's all they need. Most of the feminists need a man to tell them what time of day it is and to lead them home. And they blew it and they're mad at all men. Feminists hate men. They're sexist. They hate men; that's their problem."
On global warming: "I can tell you, our grandchildren will laugh at those who predicted global warming. We'll be in global cooling by then, if the Lord hasn't returned. I don't believe a moment of it. The whole thing is created to destroy America's free enterprise system and our economic stability."
On Islam: "I think Mohammed was a terrorist. I read enough of the history of his life, written by both Muslims and non-Muslims, that he was a violent man, a man of war."
Alan T., Exeter, NH
This evening I waited to hear PBS's take on the death of that evil gas bag Falwell. Right off the top you gave him about ten minutes too many. Then you trotted out two sycophants. I left the room and took a shower. I was offended, deeply offended. Why didn't you find someone like Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins for a little constructive rebuttal to this evil legacy? Josef Huffman, Jacksonville, FL
I just finished watching the 6 p.m. newscast and I am outraged by the choice of a pair of theosophical bozos to be the only commentators on the life of Jerry Falwell. WHERE THE HELL WAS BILL MOYERS????? Falwell, it can be reasonably argued, was the founder of the American Taliban, and PBS invites two of his slavverin' admirers to tell viewers what a magnificent man he was. How could this possibly be the best you could do?
Bob Johnson, Smyrna, GA
How about a perspective other than conservative in re Falwell's passing? He did a lot of damage, as far as I'm concerned.

Soltz vs. Morgan on the NewsHour
"The NewsHour" is where I go to get away from screaming heads. Melanie Morgan was a disgrace to the program. Who in the world thought she would be a rational voice to counter Jon Soltz of VoteVets.org?
Herb Reeves, Greenville, SC
To have included Melanie Morgan to discuss the Iraq mess was a distinct dilution of the integrity that I believe PBS generally represents. Her qualifications to speak are questionable and her interruptive manner not in keeping with your standards.
Landisville, PA
The May 8 "debate" between Jon Soltz of VoteVets.org and Melanie Morgan of Move America Forward was one of the worst such segments I've seen on NewsHour in awhile. I turn to NewsHour to escape the shouting heads pervasive on the 24-hour news networks. Between Soltz's offensive insistence that he represents "the troops" (when in fact, many of the troops vehemently disagree with his views), and Morgan's insistence that the Democrats don't want victory (merely because they want to fund it only six months at a time), and their nasty and disrespectful attitudes toward each other and the viewers, I was sickened by the whole display. If I wanted red herrings, straw men, ad hominems, and other such nonsense I wouldn't be watching NewsHour.
Chris Nandor, Arlington, WA
I'm disturbed by the NewsHour's new low; providing a television platform for an extreme right-wing attack demagogue, spewing abuse and jingoistic vitriol. Of course I'm referring to Melanie Morgan's demeaning and disparaging ad hominem attacks on your other guest, along with a slanderous impugning of the patriotism and motives of any and all non-like-minded folks. Jerry Swingle, Durango, CO
The yelling, interrupting and repeated rudeness by the talk show woman is exactly the kind of thing that keeps me from watching other news/talk shows, and the nastiness that I don't expect to see on Lehrer. I don't really blame her, since rudeness and yelling is the shtick of talk show hosts and maybe she'd never seen Lehrer and didn't realize it was out of place there. A good rule of thumb would be not to invite talk show hosts from either side for these discussions.
Dick Homan, Green Valley, AZ
Please let The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer know that some viewers were aghast at tonight's broadcast when Judy Woodruff let Melanie Morgan of Move Forward America repeatedly interrupt Judy and the other interviewee. Rudeness and a lack of civility are characteristic of some other so-called news programs, but not The NewsHour! We finally pushed the mute button on our remote.
Carolyn Fox, Mount Angel, OR
This evening (May 8) The NewsHour carried a piece that purported to be an interview of two grassroots organizations on the course of the Iraq war. On the Bush side was "Move America Forward." The spokesperson sounded much more like a Republican front organization than a genuine grassroots one. There is nobody with an impressive resume on their web page. I would hope that PBS would check the funding and principles before putting someone like that on the air.
Ben Ansbacher, Burlington, NC
Lehrer's NewsHour tonight was kinduv the last straw for me. Allowing Melanie Morgan to yell and block out the words of her opposite number was unforgivably rude, but she was not reprimanded; the camera swung to her, as though this were a contest show. For a long time the effort to "give both sides" has allowed similarly rude people a forum to promote minority, sometimes extreme, views. Please stop it!

Last night the NewsHour attempted to help our viewers understand why the members of Congress are having so much difficulty arriving at a decision regarding the way forward in Iraq. We believe the intensity of the pressure being exerted on Democrats and Republicans by the "wings" of their respective parties is having an impact on those who are looking for some sort of compromise position. We decided to let representatives of those wings explain their positions, hoping they would participate in a dialogue with us and each other. As our guests demonstrated, however, that was a forlorn hope and the result was a lot of heat, but very little light.
Since neither guest was in the studio with Judy Woodruff, there wasn't much she could do to prevent them from interrupting one another, short of saying — as she did at least three times — "please let him/her finish his/her point". The NewsHour style is to ask pointed questions politely; we expect our guests to subscribe to the same rules. Since the program is produced live, we can't do much to eliminate rude guests from your television screen once the segment has begun; what we can do is guarantee you will never see that person on our program again.

James Stuck
Edmond, OK
Sport: Sitting Volleyball
James Stuck is a member of Team USA’s Men's Sitting Volleyball Team. His height – 6 feet, 5 inches – and his arm span and long torso make him a perfect athlete for the sport. After making the team in 2006, Stuck moved to the University of Central Oklahoma, an official U.S. Olympic and Paralympic training site, where he lives and trains fulltime with his teammates.
During his time on the team, James has seen ups and downs. They won silver at the Parapan American Games in 2007 and again in 2011. The 2011 game was especially hard fought, against one of their arch-rivals, Brazil, but the second place finish in that tournament, along with another loss at the Intercontinental Cup in Egypt, meant the team would not be qualified for London 2012.
Stuck came to Paralympic sports after losing part of his leg and sustaining other injuries in a 2005 IED attack in Kirkuk, Iraq. He spent nearly a year in Walter Reed Army Medical Center in rehabilitation, and came out determined to try new activities: snowboarding, skiing, soccer, track and sitting volleyball. “I went skiing five weeks after I’d lost my leg. It just shows what you can accomplish.” He has also taken up kayaking and snowboarding since he was injured, and he enrolled in college, saying, “I knew once I was medically discharged from the military that I wanted to continue my education to help others.”

Episodes King Lear Play Summary and Full Text Full Text with Clips Organization and Notation	King Lear
Play Summary and Full Text: Full Text with Clips: Organization and Notation
The Play in Summary and Full TextBrief Tour with McKellen ClipsFull Text Scene Link DirectoryFull Text with ClipsDetailed Synopsis *	Organization This web edition of King Lear uses primarily the Folio (F) text of 1623 as a basis, but it adds several longer passages and one entire scene from the Quarto (Q) text of 1608. It also adds or substitutes several individual words or phrases from the Q text. It is thus a conflated text.
It has divided the play into the conventional five acts and scenes within each act. However, to manage the longer scenes, it has broken them into segments, yielding 40 scenes or segments.
Each scene or segment of a scene has a web page. Each web page (of the play itself) begins with a short synopsis of the scene or segment, followed by a clip from the McKellen film for that scene or segment, followed by the play text. Note that Act IV Scene III does not appear in the McKellen film, thus has no clip.
Notation
The play text includes the entire text of the conflated edition. However, the McKellen film cuts lines from every scene or segment. The lines or words cut from the text are indicated by red type.
This edition designates Acts with Roman capitals; it designates Scenes with Roman low case letters (unless the word “scene” is used, in which case it uses Roman capitals); it designates segments with a letter from the Latin alphabet. Thus the third segment from Scene II of Act II would be labeled II.ii.c.
Quarto Text
Longer passages from the Quarto text inserted in the Folio text are designed by [square brackets]. This edition does not indicate individual words or short phrases taken from the Quarto text, either as substitutes or additions.
Annotations
Words or phrases that are underlined have a corresponding annotation. Annotations appear in a light box when clicking on the underlined word or phrase. The light box closes by clicking anywhere except the light box itself.
Stage Directions
All stage directions appear in Italic type. For the most part stage directions without brackets come directly from the Folio text; no such direction has been omitted, although one or two have been moved a line or two to more accurately reflect entrances. Spelling has been modernized (Fool instead of Foole, for example) and regularized (Gloucester everywhere, rather than sharing time with Gloster as happens in the Folio text). The name Bastard for Edmund has been retained in the stage directions, but not in line names. Stage directions in [brackets] have been added later. This edition adds no stage direction that is not in some other edition of the play.

Riveting episode! My class enjoyed it throughly. They have expressed to me they have a better appreciation for education they are receiving. We will continue to watch the series.
Caroline B
Its amazing how much they are like us. They have the same dreams and needs.
Elizabeth Lamer
I think this was an ok video because i think it should show more lives , like in Italy or somethinq like that … but overall it was great!
Carolina
Please don’t take this down from the internet. I go back to it all the time. In two weeks I will be watching it with my students after their testing and discuss with them the value of education and hopefully helping them become more aware of how lucky they are to live in a country with the education system we have. The U.S. system might not be perfect, but my students are lucky they can go to good schools for free. Not to mention what they will gain from looking into the culture and society of all the countries these children come from. This is an amazing series I can’t wait until 2012!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Shelbi
I had to watch this video for a school assignment. I watched with my eight-yr-old daughter. We learned a lot from this video. It is very interesting to see what it is like in the lives of other children around the world, and the challenges they face, in regards to education etc.. I was very touched by these precious children, and hope they make it.
K Vanpool
I watched this as a college assignment, but returned to have my daughters watch it as well. This documentary is not only touching, but a real eye opener on how vital education is across the world. It really got our attention on how much we take for granted when we’re not in such unfortunate situations. Most adults I know don’t have the drive some of these students have for seeking out their education. It’s very intriguing that children who may not fully understand the importance of school at their age, understand enough to know that it is crucial for their future even without the support of their parents or societies. I hope they all succeed in finishing their education and are able to choose their own path in life. My professor asked us a question prior to this assignment if we “thought that all babies are born on the same slate in life”? This is a sad, yet brilliant example of our different slates. Thank you for these series!
Margaret Fay
I watched the Back to School/Time for School videos original series with Neeraj and the Narciso family with my students in Singapore. I want to introduce it to my new school in England. Can we still get them from the pbs website?

Yes, it is amazing how these Children are much alike us. They have dreams and imaginations the only difference is that we have a better chance at achiving our goals and dreams. It is very sad to see some kids go throught these things while we are mad at our parents because we can have a Ipod. When, most of these kids don’t even know how to read and write!

How can I get a DVD version of this? I’m in American Samoa and I can’t get Itunes to work for a download. I really want to show my high school students the struggle that other students in the world endure because they value education so highly. It’s a perspective they would really benefit from seeing.
