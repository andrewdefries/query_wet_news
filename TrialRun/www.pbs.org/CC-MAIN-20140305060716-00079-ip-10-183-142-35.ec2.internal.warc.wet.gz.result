DocumentCloud Users Make Ballot Design An Election Issue
Tweet
By Amanda Hickman
October 27, 2010
When we make lists of the kinds of source documents users can upload to DocumentCloud, they can get pretty long. DocumentCloud is court filings, hearing transcripts, testimony, legislation, lab reports, memos, meeting minutes, correspondence. I can say with absolute confidence that in all of our planning, “ballots” never once came up as the sort of document a news organization might want to annotate for readers. Our relentlessly creative users have shown us otherwise.
This summer, the Memphis Commercial Appeal rounded out its guide to August’s primary elections with a sample ballot. Their digital content editor told us that many readers who’d missed the sample ballot in the print edition turned to the version online as primary day approached. Earlier this month, they added the general election ballot to that guide. New York Ballots
WNYC, New York City’s NPR affiliate, also published a few ballots this summer. In an effort to comply with a 2002 federal law that mandates significant updates to voting systems in each state, New York City introduced paper ballots for the 2010 primary election, replacing the city’s famously arcane voting machines. One look at the new design and everyone was up in arms, proclaiming its absurdity, but WNYC actually invited a group of ballot design experts to review the city’s new ballots. Their findings: the ballot was confusing.
Design for Democracy works to increase civic participation, in part through a ballot design project that aims to make voting easier and more accurate. WNYC used Design for Democracy’s feedback to annotate a sample ballot on their blog, offering readers vital voting advice. When the city released sample ballots for November’s general election, a local think tank pointed out that the instructions erroneously advise voters to mark the oval above their candidate’s name. In fact, the relevant ovals appear below candidate’s names. WNYC highlighted the issue by embedding a sample ballot on their blog. Apparently the “oval above” language was mandated by state law. Don’t believe me? See for yourself — WNYC posted the legislation, with the relevant passage highlighted. From now on, my laundry list of things DocumentCloud catalogs will most definitely include ballots.

Home > Story > Chapter 6
In 1556, at the age of 29, Philip II became the ruler of Spain, overseeing a realm that stretched from Europe to the Philippines, an empire on which the sun literally never set. Compared to his father, Charles V, Philip was far more concerned with converting the peoples of the New World to Catholicism and treating them humanely. But when it came to Europe, Philip's faith made him even more intolerant of heretics than Charles. After Dutch Protestants rebelled against his rule in the Netherlands, Philip launched a protracted and sometimes vicious campaign to suppress the revolt. At the same time, his forces in the Mediterranean engaged in one of the bloodiest naval battles in history against the Ottoman Empire. Although these conflicts ended in stalemates, they were so expensive that, again and again, Philip was forced to declare the Spanish Crown bankrupt. Only the prospect of more treasure arriving from the New World made bankers willing to continue lending to Philip. ...One can't forget that that religious faith was what justified the power of these monarchies. In 16th-century Europe, the monarchies were called “Monarchies of Divine Right.” Political power was religious power.- Juan Hernández, Spanish architectural historian
The Richest Mountain in the World
In 1545, after silver was discovered in the Andes Mountains in what is today Bolivia, it was immediately clear that this enormously rich strike had the potential to lift the Spanish Empire out of debt. But there was one problem: the silver mine and the town of Potosí that grew up around it are located at 13,000 feet, making Potosí the highest city in the world. It is a bitterly cold and forbidding place. Spaniards refused to work in the mine, and African slaves found it intolerable and constantly revolted and escaped into the surrounding mountains. Unless forced, the indigenous population generally refused to work for the Spanish, and Spain's "New Laws" expressly forbid enslaving them. But since they were the only feasible source of workers for mine, Philip II decided to put the native people to work by extracting a form of labor tribute from local chieftains. For the next 300 years, virtually all of the indigenous men in the region would be forced to take turns working in deadly conditions in the mine.
The historical records reveal that millions may have died while working in the mine. A metaphorical way of thinking about it is that so much silver was mined here that you could build a bridge of silver from Potosi to Spain. And with the skeletons of all the men who died here, you could build a bridge of skeletons back from Spain. - Soledad Fortun, expert on Potosi history
Between 1545 and 1600, a barren hillside was transformed into a mining town of 150,000, making Potosí the largest city in the New World and more than twice as large as London. And the mountain, Cerro Rico, turned out to be, as one geologist noted, "the richest mountain in the history of the world." The mine eventually produced 35,000 tons of silver, more than existed in all of the countries of Europe put together. Learn about the mine at Potosi, "the richest mountain in the history of the world."
A Stunning Defeat
In Philip's eyes, the best use he could make of the vast mountain of silver God had given him was to end the Dutch rebellion. To win the war in the Netherlands, he knew he had to depose England's Protestant queen, Elizabeth I, and cut off the support the English were giving the Dutch rebels. So he began to plan an invasion of England and one of the most ambitious naval campaigns in history.
The Spanish Armada's infamous attack against England in 1588 turned out to be one of the biggest upsets in military history. Between the fighting and the storm-driven destruction, some seventy Spanish ships were sunk and 15,000 of Philip's men died.
An era was drawing to a close—one in which the kings of Spain believed that they had been chosen by God to rule the world. With the Armada's defeat, Spain would soon relinquish its role as the world's only superpower.

Gen. Janaka Perera and his wife were among the dead and at least 80 more were wounded in the bomb attack at the United National Party office in Anuradhapura town, some 124 miles north of the capital Colombo, military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara told the Associated Press.“A suicide bomber went inside and exploded. My senior officer there said 22 people were killed, and among the dead were Janaka Perera and his wife,” Deputy Inspector General K.P.P. Pathirana told Reuters. Hospital officials later raised the death toll to 26.The blast comes amid renewed clashes between government troops and Tamil Tiger fighters over control of the rebels’ administrative capital in the northern town of Kilinochchi.Fighting on Sunday killed 17 rebels and wounded 30 near Kilinochchi, while one soldier was killed and eight were wounded, the military said.The military said Monday’s blast was the latest carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are credited with establishing the practice of suicide bombing during a decades-long war to establish a separate homeland for the country’s Tamil minority. Tamils have long voiced claims of discrimination at the hands of governments controlled by majority ethnic Sinhalese.“It was an LTTE suicide attack,” military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said, according to Reuters.Wearing a hidden explosives vest, the assailant “embraced the former commander” before detonating, the rebel-affiliated TamilNet Web site reported, according to news services.The bomber apparently targeted Perera because of his successes against the separatist cause during his years in the military, Nanayakkara said.However, an official from the United National Party accused the government of requests for a stronger security detail for Perera, who has also criticized the way Colombo has conducted its military campaign against the rebels.“The government must take full responsibility,” party officlal Tissa Attanayake said, according to the BBC. “They did not give him adequate security for political reasons.”Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the attack and said the Tamil Tiger group faces “severe setbacks” in its northern strongholds and “is now making every attempt to create violent backlashes in other parts of the country.”Sri Lanka’s government ended a six-year cease-fire with Tamil Tiger rebels in January amid an uptick in violence, including a roadside bomb that exploded near a bus in the capital city of Colombo, killing four people.The military and rebels have been engaged in a civil war for more than 20 years, and the now-defunct truce, signed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Tamil Tiger rebels’ leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in 2002, was thought to be the best chance of permanently ending the conflict. It received widespread international support, especially from the United States, Japan, European Union and India. SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERAnuradhapura Brig.

Suffering and Death
Armand Nicholi:
Lewis's worldview is very much based on a person that appeared in history. He looked very carefully at the historical documents, and this person who claimed to be God. And, indeed, Lewis concluded that this person was who he claimed to be, and that he died as he predicted he would, and that he rose again on the third day. Now if this person did appear today, so that we could experience him, would we believe?
Jeremy Fraiberg:
No, you could still freely choose not to believe. You could say that the evidence is demonstrable and clear, but I choose to live otherwise because — for my own reasons I disagree with some of the claims of that authority.
Armand Nicholi:
Did you not say that if you saw someone pick up this building, twirl it around on his finger, and set it down, that you would be forced to believe?
Jeremy Fraiberg:
Strong motivating factor.
Frederick Lee:
Do you believe in miracles?
Jeremy Fraiberg:
I'd admit of anything, I just need to see evidence.
Frederick Lee:
Well, I'm not asking about evidence; I'm asking about the philosophical question of is it possible? Is it possible?
Jeremy Fraiberg:
Well, I operate by rules of induction, I mean — what happened before leads me to believe what will come in the future. But — I've never seen that before, and it would be so extraordinary that it would completely —
Doug Holladay:
But you're open to the idea, that's the thing.
Jeremy Fraiberg:
I am open to the idea.
Doug Holladay:
That's the point he's trying to get to you on.
Frederick Lee:
If you look at the Hebrew scriptures, though, I mean, it's filled with story after story after story of the Israelites, the chosen people, seeing God in the most miraculous ways, beyond anything that is conceivable in human terms, and certainly beyond anything that they had ... of science and intellect to explain.
Jeremy Fraiberg:
What you presuppose in your argument is that these incidents actually happened. And show me the parting of the Red Sea. Show me turning water into wine.
Margaret Klenck:
Yeah, but I think this is where we have to look at mythology, and how mythology is, is real — or is true, but not necessarily real, and that this is a way in which people make sense of the miraculous, make sense of the unknown, make sense of the battle to understand, to be loved, to not be loved, why does — going back to father or mother, you know ... why did mother love you best? I mean, we come up with Cain and Abel, I mean, we do have mythology, it grows out for a reason. It's not just stories.
Armand Nicholi:
Isn't it true, though, that — as Lewis says — that the philosophy that we bring to our experience, to our observations, influences how we interpret them? Now, if we approach a miracle with a philosophy that has ruled out the supernatural, then we have to find some explanation for it.
Frederick Lee:
If one excludes a priori the possibility of miracles, as most scientists do, then any unusual event will always be interpreted in some way in terms we understand. On the other hand, if one does admit to the possibility of miracles, what one is saying then is that there are forces that can act on the universe from outside the system — the system being what we normally consider to be obeying the laws of physics and chemistry and so forth.
Jeremy Fraiberg:
I grant you that.
Frederick Lee:
And that's when one comes down to: Is this story made up or not? And the key thing there is, here is a man, Jesus Christ, who's documented as claiming to be the son of God. Now, I've seen patients do that in my psychiatric rotations — "I'm Napoleon, I'm Caesar, I'm God, I'm Jesus," but they're invariably psychotic. And yet, from the scriptures, from all the witnesses that we have, what Jesus said reflects some of the deepest, most insightful wisdom into human nature. He's not a lunatic, okay? He's not crazy. There's no other alternative, other than to assume that this bizarre claim, this fantastic claim, that's never been made or spoken by human lips in the history of the world has to be true. There's no other explanation.
Michael Shermer:
Fred, can I ask you, just a simple scientific question.
Frederick Lee:
Yes.
Michael Shermer:
The Resurrection. As a scientist, aren't you curious how God did it? Jump start the heart? Rebuild the cells? New DNA? How'd he do it?
Frederick Lee:
Well, I guess that's akin to asking the question, how did he create Adam?
Michael Shermer:
Aren't you curious? Don't you want to know?
Frederick Lee:
Sure, I'd like to know, but in some sense — well, here's an example: You have a God of infinite wisdom — assuming that you believe in a God, right? So, of infinite wisdom, who created this fantastic thing by means, you know, that you've asked me to explain ...
Michael Shermer:
But, if I can clarify that. Once you've tried to understand the forces by which God intervened into this system from outside this system, you're just back in the system again, looking for natural causes. God used some electromagnetic force to tweak the genome, to restart the heart, to whatever. If that's what you're doing, then you're just doing science. And the only other choice is, you just say, "beats me, it's a miracle." I give up.
Margaret Klenck:
Well, there are a few other answers to that throughout history. I mean, well, one of the classic theological answers is that God's time is not in any way connected to human time and that therefore, God can break in to human time, at any point, at any time, and does, so that God is infant in the manger, and God is reigning on the cross, and God is dead and alive. God is not confined by human history, human time, and it's just as reasonable, if we're going to stay with, you know, qualifying things by reason, to assume that God can have God's own time, and not be controlled by us, or confined by, you know, our little, limited consciousness.
Winifred Gallagher:
It sort of disturbs me that we seem to be heading in this direction, where in order to be a religious person or to have a spiritual worldview, you have to believe in miracles, which I think is absolutely not the case. I think you can be — you can have no interest in miracles you can disbelieve miracles, or maybe you could say, "Maybe there are miracles, maybe there are not, I don't know, I don't particularly care," you could have any of those attitudes, and still be a profoundly spiritual person.

Discuss >
Are extraordinary events evidence of God's existence? Did the miracles recorded in the Bible and other religious scriptures really happen as described? Have you yourself experienced something miraculous? Is it necessary to believe in miracles to hold a spiritual worldview? After reading the conversation from the program, add your thoughts.

A ‘lost boy’ of Sudan returns to rebuild his homeland January 7, 2011
On Sunday, the people of Southern Sudan will begin voting on whether to remain part of a unified Sudan or become an independent state. Sudan, Africa’s largest nation, is an oil-rich country run by Islamist Arabs. What happens there matters to all of us for strategic and humanitarian reasons. Here’s what you need to know:
For generations, southern Sudan has been dominated by the Islamist-run government in Khartoum, which has sought to impose Sharia law on the south’s Christians and animists.
Religion is one of the main causes of two bloody civil wars that have killed two million southern Sudanese. Another point of contention: control of Sudan’s oil reserves that lie mostly in the south and along the border with the north. If, as expected, the south votes to secede, many fear another wave of violence, despite assurances from Sudan’s president, Omar al Bashir, that he will accept the results of the election: “If the south secedes, we will welcome it.”
But can Bashir be trusted? He has been indicted as a war criminal for his brutal military campaign against rebels and civilians in Darfur. That fighting, which began in 2003, has left 300,000 dead. Need to Know sent producer George Lerner to southern Sudan to report on one former refugee’s efforts to help rebuild his homeland in anticipation of a vote for independence.

My gut is telling me that the North will let the South secede but will shortly thereafter move across the new border to take a few oil wells.

Great story, by the way. I was really glad to have my daughter watching. I think she may have finally gotten an inkling of how lucky we are to have been born where and when we were born here in the U.S.A.
It was also very inspirational to see someone who started out with so little do something with his life that helps so many others.

I just finished watching the show on tv, and i saw how some schools were able to raise some money and were able to help out with getting the clean water for the people and i was wondering how could my school help? where do i go in order to get a bit more information to spread out and get help with starting a club for it and help raise some money?

The name of Salva Dut’s organization is Water for Sudan. Check out the website for more information:

Thanks for watching!

Hi Kati,
I work for a non-profit organization called H2O for Life. We match schools in the US with schools in developing nations to raise funds for these types of water projects. One of the wells in the story was funded by one of our participating schools, Stillwater Junior High in MN. We have been working with Water for sudan for a few years and there are many more schools in Sudan that still need water. Check out our website, http://www.h2oforlifeschools.org. Or email me at shall@h2oforlifeschools.org.

Hello!
The website was not working for me. I clicked on the link, and everything I found on Google for Water for Sudan the site could not be found. Am I doing something wrong? Please inform. Thank you.
