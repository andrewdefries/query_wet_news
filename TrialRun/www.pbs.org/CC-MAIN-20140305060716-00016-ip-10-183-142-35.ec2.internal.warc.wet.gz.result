He covered the Middle East as a Times reporter in the 1980s, winning two Pulitzer prizes and writing an award-winning book, From Beirut to Jerusalem. His latest book is The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization. He just returned from a trip to Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Gulf and Brussels and is with us now.MARGARET WARNER: Welcome, Tom.THOMAS FRIEDMAN, The New York Times: Good to be here, Margaret.MARGARET WARNER: First, your thoughts on Elizabeth’s piece. And I’m particularly interested, of course, Osama bin Laden has wrapped himself or as tried to in the Palestinian cause. What do you think is the likely fallout in terms of our war on terror if this downward spiral that Elizabeth has been chronicling in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict continues?THOMAS FRIEDMAN: One of the things that really struck me from the trip I just took, Margaret, was it was really the replay of a trip I took about six weeks ago right after September 11. I didn’t go to Afghanistan then but I went to Pakistan, the Persian Gulf and to Europe. On that first trip, what really struck me was the iron curtain of misunderstanding between America and the Arab-Muslim world today. There is still, or there was then, a widespread feeling that bin Laden didn’t do this, that there was no proof and, if he did do it, maybe we deserved a little hit, you know, which people might tell you privately. Six weeks later, the Taliban have fallen, Afghanistan has been liberated by American troops. I went back to the same region. And what was really striking to me was the extent I heard the exact same thing. We have won the war. We have not won the hearts and minds of the Arab-Muslim world at all. There’s still a lot of people there quietly rooting for bin Laden. Some of that is related to their own frustration with their own governments, we know. A lot of it is related to what we just saw as well. This is their way of getting a little bit of revenge on us for what is perceived to be our unwavering support for Israel. By not granting us our victory, in a sense, by not acknowledging that victory, this meat grinder of people that is being… Whose lives are being destroyed every day in this conflict is aired across the Arab world every night in news footage in a very tendentious way to be sure, in a way that often doesn’t show the Palestinian provocation only the Israeli reaction, but it has an enormously corrosive effect on American standing in that part of the world. That’s just a fact.MARGARET WARNER: You have written frequently since September 11 that when the President called it a war on terror, it was really a misnomer, that terror is a tool, that it’s really a war on what you called religious totalitarianism throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Explain what you mean by that.THOMAS FRIEDMAN: What I was really trying to highlight was what I call the circle of bin Ladenism. There are kind of three parts to this story. There is bin Laden. Bin Now Laden in my view, Margaret, is a combination of Charles Manson and Jack Welch. Okay. He is a cult leader with the organizational skills of an American corporate titan. You don’t find these guys very often. This is a unique character. That’s over here. Over here is what I would call “bin Ladenism.” Why do people who wouldn’t even maybe condone or endorse the mass murder that he did nevertheless have a little bit of support for him? That has to do with, I think, three interwoven factors that produce this bin Ladenism.One is authoritarian Arab-Muslim regimes. We have an Arab-Muslim world today that does not have a single democratically elected government save for Turkey from Morocco to the border of India – authoritarian government. These authoritarian governments because they are illegitimate and unelected need to legitimize themselves. And what they’ve done is strike bargains basically with the religious authorities, a bargain, which basically says, “You legitimate me and I’ll let you kind of do whatever you want.” That was Zia el Huk in Pakistan. And the same bargain is across the Arab-Muslim world. You have authoritarian governments, anti-modernist religious leaders who often indulge in anti-modernist religious education. That produces the third part of the wheel, which is poverty. So the three parts in this wheel all reinforce each other. The poverty reinforces the authoritarian government, the authoritarianism reinforces the anti-modernist religious education and the anti-modernist religious education reinforces the poverty.MARGARET WARNER: But you’ve written again several times that the U.S. could go after bin Laden and his killers, but the U.S. cannot kill bin Laden’s ideas, that leaders in the Arab-Muslim world have to do that. You’re saying they’re part of the problem. How do we get them to do that?THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, the only way we’re going to do it is with partners. You know, I’ve written many times that Saudi Arabia is a big part of this problem. They’re also essential to the solution. It’s impossible for me to imagine us solving this problem without the help of Saudi Arabia. They have too much religious legitimacy within the Islamic Muslim world and too much money. I mean, you go into schoolrooms and madrases, these Islamic schools in Pakistan -MARGARET WARNER: As you have.THOMAS FRIEDMAN: As I have — and there’s a sign on the wall: “This room brought to you by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” That’s true from Morocco to Indonesia. So Saudi Arabia is part of the problem and they are also essential to the solution. We need partners. The reason I was so excited about Pervez Musharraf – the President of Pakistan’s speech over the weekend is that he’s the first leader who has really kind of broke out and said, “You know what? We have a problem. And it starts with me. I am the problem. My name is Pervez Musharraf and I am part of the problem. And the problem is that in the ruling deals we’ve cut with our people, in the case of Pakistan the military and the mosque alliance, and the kind of education we are providing,” and basically said, “I’m going to break that cycle. We’re going to offer a different alternative, progressive Islam and we’re not going to have a military mosque alliance, but a military mainstream alliance.” Whether he’ll be able to pull that off, I don’t know. But I think it was… It’s a great opportunity for somebody to really lead a way out of this.MARGARET WARNER: But as you pointed out throughout the rest of the Arab-Muslim world I mean, or rather in the world, the only two leaders to give speeches saying Islam is a religion of tolerance were George W. Bush and Tony Blair. You didn’t hear that from any Muslim or Arab leaders.THOMAS FRIEDMAN: There’s been a real dearth of leadership. These guys are scared. They’re frightened. The truth is they’re frightened of Osama bin Laden still. You haven’t seen many American Muslim leaders give that speech either, and they live in America. I think they’re frightened, too. I think that, you know, the reach of bin Laden is far and wide. And when you have these illegitimate regimes and these leaders know that their people are quietly rooting for bin Laden, you see, say one thing for bin Laden, Margaret; he’s an authentic character. He’s a Saudi millionaire who gave up a life of riches in Saudi Arabia to go live in a cave in Afghanistan and first fight the Soviets and then fight the Americans. I detest the man, but he is an authentic character. Well, you only defeat that kind of authenticity with another kind of authenticity, okay, and that is somebody has to articulate an authentic, progressive Islamic message, I think, you know to face up with that. These guys aren’t ready to do to do that because they struck their bargains with these other mullahs and these other characters in their own country because they need them because they’re unelected, they’re illegitimate.MARGARET WARNER: So then who is going to bring about what you’ve called this war within Islam, not a war against Islam by the West but a war within Islam, a war for enlightenment or reform?THOMAS FRIEDMAN: It can only come from Arabs and Muslims themselves. We can engage in the… One of the worst things about American policy toward that part of the world we really only talk to them about two things: Oil and Israel. Our basic policy is on Israel: Just be nice to the Jews. Just be nice to the Jews, and you can do whatever you want at home. Okay? That’s one thing. And oil: Just keep the price between $22 and $28 and you can do whatever you want at home. And our view was what we don’t know won’t hurt us. What we discovered on September 11 is what we didn’t know did hurt us because back in the gas station behind the pumps people were hatching plots directed very much against us.MARGARET WARNER: Afghanistan where you’ve just been, what does the… What does the U.S. role have to be now to make sure that Afghanistan doesn’t revert, as you said in your column yesterday, to “Mr. Bin Laden’s neighborhood” again?THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, you know, first of all you can’t imagine how broken this place is. I mean, my wife asked me when I, you know, “What does Kabul look like?” I said it looked exactly like ground zero. Half of Kabul looks exactly like ground zero, not because of what we did, but because of what they’ve done to themselves through 22 years of civil war. My wife collects postcards. She said, “When you’re in Kabul get some postcards.” Where am I going to find postcards in Kabul? Well, sure enough, I went to the Intercontinental Hotel and they have a bookstore that’s still open there, and I just grabbed all the postcards that I could and paid for them, came home and I– when I got home, I discovered one postcard is of rubble. I looked on the back, it says the destroyed Afghanistan National Museum. Now when you are selling postcards of rubble, you’ve been at war a long time. And these people have been at war so long that they have destroyed this country. I mean, there is… It is nation building on the moon. That’s what we are talking about. And so at two levels, what do they need? They need, first of all, someone to provide security. And what was striking about all the Afghan officials I spoke to there was whether it was the education minister, okay, or the interim president, everyone starts out by saying “We need security and we don’t trust any of these warlords to provide it. We need you to come in and do that.” And, secondly, they need money. But the two go together. The idea that you can just pour in money and stir and you get a resurrected country, not going to happen.MARGARET WARNER: When they say we need you, do they mean we need you Americans to be part of the force?THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Absolutely. Everyone wants us. They don’t trust anyone else.MARGARET WARNER: Not even the Europeans.THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Not even the Europeans. I think that you can have a situation where you galvanize a force, where we have a lead role; we have maybe a symbolic role and others play a more visible role and we’re in the background. I think our role could take many forms. But the idea that you’ll have a sustained and credible force there without us, you know, listen to the report you had earlier, you know, Kandahar, people are already firing on the Marines there. I took off from Bagram military base, hitched a ride on an American military transport as we were leaving. And they told us people are firing tracer bullets at the end of the runway. This place is totally untamed outside the city. We went to Pakistan where we were at the American military base in Pakistan and we talked to the American pilots there, they told us we do not fly a mission from Pakistan to Afghanistan where we are not fired on over Pakistani territory by small arms fire. This place is wild. And the idea of pacifying it, you know, is going to be a huge, huge effort. I say it with a heavy heart because I don’t want to send, you know, my neighbor’s son to go do this. It’s going to be really hard. All I know is if we don’t do it, the place is going to go right back to Mr. Bin Laden’s neighborhood. If we do do it, it still may not work.MARGARET WARNER: Finally, just briefly but something you’ve written about and you have a lot of experience having lived in Beirut and Jerusalem, how do Americans learn to live now with a level of personal risk that we’ve never felt before?THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, Margaret, I always think of when I lived in Beirut I had a Lebanese friend to used to tell me every time she traveled on a plane she carried a bomb in her suitcase because the odds of two people carrying a bomb on the same plane were much higher. And it’s that kind of mind game that people played in a place like Lebanon. And we’re going to have to do the same thing basically because we’re not going back to normal. We’re going to have to redefine normal. Either that or you become paralyzed and you basically sit at home in your basement. I don’t want to do that. Now redefining normal is going to mean that we’re going to have to go out and we’re going to have to travel, and we’re going to have to accept risk at one level, but I also think it means being smart about it. How many times have you been in line at the airport lately and you see someone raking an 80-year-old lady up and down with a metal detector? You sometimes have got to say, “Wait a minute. I don’t think this lady is the person we’re looking for.” Okay? So at one level we have to be smarter and another level we’re going to have to be personally much braver.MARGARET WARNER: Tom Friedman, thank you.THOMAS FRIEDMAN: A pleasure.

Sept. 28, 2005: Update: President Bush says U.S. forces are prepared for an increase in violence. Sept. 26, 2005: An estimated 100,000 antiwar demonstrators gather in Washington, D.C. Sept. 6, 2005: Four parents coping with the loss of their sons in Iraq discuss the conflict. MARGARET WARNER: Joining me are the two leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee: Republican Chairman John Warner and the ranking Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin. Welcome to you both, senators. And, Sen. Warner, I’d like to begin with you. Were you reassured from what you heard today that the Pentagon is pursuing the right strategy in Iraq?SEN. JOHN WARNER: I’ve been with this team namely Rumsfeld, Abizaid and Casey yesterday here in the Senate about 60 senators were briefed by the team, then again on the House side early this morning for a breakfast briefing and for four hour today before our committee. These two outstanding officers Gens. Abizaid and Casey came before not only the Congress but appearing before the American public to set forth in specific detail again what our goals are and how we’re going about it.And they also added, and I think most importantly, their own note that this is going to be in their own professional opinion a very tough going for the next 90 days because we’re seeing a referendum on the 15th of October, odds are that that constitution will be adopted by the people. And that’s to be followed by a very important election on Dec. 15, when the new and hopefully last government, in other words it will be there for four years, is elected by the people.So there’s been progress on the military front and progress on the important of necessity of establishing a new government in that land.MARGARET WARNER: What was your view, Sen. Levin, on whether there’s been progress in Iraq, whether the strategy is the right one?SEN. CARL LEVIN: I don’t think there’s been progress in Iraq. I think as a matter of fact that things may be worse than they were even a year ago in terms of the insurgency; it’s gained in strength. We’ve got the reports now from the CIA that are published, printed, that say that Iraq has become a training ground for terrorists, which are being exported. So I don’t think things are going well on the ground.I think we heard a lot of rosy scenarios which were again painted today — hopes, everybody hopes that things will go better. But where we did get some daylight finally was when Gen. Casey and Gen. Abizaid acknowledged that you’ve got to have political progress in order to have military progress and that this vote on the constitution if it is approved by the majority but disapproved by a strong minority of the Sunni Arabs could actually make things worse; it could actually create more conflict by hardening the sides, putting into the constitution provisions which are divisive rather than unifying.They acknowledged that today and I thought that at least was important acknowledgment because without a political coming together in Iraq our military leaders have said that we cannot win militarily.MARGARET WARNER: Sen. Warner, what about the topic that occupied so much of today’s hearing which had to do with the training of the Iraqi troops, and there was a lot of back and forth about whether the US was gaining ground on that front or losing ground. What conclusion did you come to?SEN. JOHN WARNER: I’m glad you raised it because that’s a very important question because any strategy we had for the future is pinned on our ability together with coalition forces to train sufficient number of Iraqis in the military profession as well as the policing profession to take over that country so our troops can come home.I was there just three weeks ago and I respect my good friend and colleague’s views, but in a way I disagree. I think, I saw progress with my own eyes. I talked to a great many people from the prime minister on down through the various ministries; I talked with our senior officers; I talked with the privates and the sergeants. And I talked with some of the people — just the merchants in the streets.There’s a better feeling that this government which will be elected this fall will finally take over and bring this land together in a cohesive way and rule it as they desire, as the Iraqis want and desire — not the way the Americans want and desire.So let’s go back to the question of the training. We started about two years ago really in this training. And it has not been, and I think my colleague shares this, as successful as we had hoped. But in the last 120 days I think there’s been great progress.We now have well over say 170,000 who’ve received some degree of training. But the most important statistics that we received today is that 75 percent of the battalions and there are 80-some odd battalions now actively in training, finished training, going into the field, 75 percent of them are working with our forces engaged daily in combat and risk taking activities — risk taking to the extent where really many more Iraqi soldiers are killed as opposed to coalition soldiers.So they’re bearing the brunt of this conflict, they’re showing courage and a willingness to some day take charge.MARGARET WARNER: Did you see that kind of progress, Sen. Levin, on the training of the Iraqi forces?SEN. CARL LEVIN: It’s spotty in some areas, the statistics sound better but in one key area that’s no improvement at all, and that is the number of Iraqi battalions that are able to independently take on the insurgents on their own without our support. That is one battalion four months ago and it’s only one battalion now. So in that area there’s been no progress at all. So I’d say it’s uneven progress.But what’s critically important is again that even if there is progress in training which we all hope for so that there could be a transfer, we can’t succeed in transferring this responsibility to the Iraqis unless the Iraqis politically come together and make the compromises which are essential.SEN. CARL LEVIN: Otherwise, if the Sunni Arabs, for instance, continue to be disenchanted and are out of the deal and don’t participate, then we’re not going to see the kind of unity politically which everyone acknowledges must take place. And what I think is missing so far and what the military leaders today — at least Gen. Casey acknowledged — really is missing so far is a forceful statement to the Iraqis that unless they put their political house in order, make the compromises necessary to produce that unity by the end of the year that we then would have to consider a timetable for withdrawal. Only that kind of pressure on the Iraqis I believe will lead them to make those compromises which are critically essential to winning this battle over the insurgency.SEN. JOHN WARNER: Margaret if I could just reply.MARGARET WARNER: Please.SEN. JOHN WARNER: Sen. Levin’s thesis is correct. The degree to which we have political unity between the three central factions, namely the Kurds and Shia and Sunni, the stronger the government will be. And the Sunnis by their own choice stayed away from the elections last January — those historic elections that we all saw where the people put their finger in the ink and proudly came out and a very substantial number of Iraqis voted — but the Sunnis did not have a major participation. This time -MARGARET WARNER: But do you think –SEN. JOHN WARNER: This time in the referendum it’s likely they’re going to vote against the constitution. But all the odds makers say it will carry that constitution, that then the Sunnis have made decision, and we know for a fact they’re registered in large numbers; they’re going to participate in the Dec. 15 election and at that time I’m hopeful I say to my good friend, by virtue of that election they will have a sizable representation in this new government.MARGARET WARNER: What about his idea – go ahead –SEN. CARL LEVIN: What Gen. Casey acknowledged today; however, is that even if this constitution is adopted by a majority, that if the vast majority of Sunnis continue to oppose it and vote against it, that the adoption of the constitution could make things worse rather than better. He didn’t say they will; he said it is possible — that things would be worse if the adoption, if that constitution is adopted over the strong objections of the Sunni community.MARGARET WARNER: So, Sen. Warner, briefly just on Sen. Levin’s point, do you think more pressure would have to be exerted or should be exerted by the US on the Iraqis, some kind of a timetable, some kind of benchmark?SEN. JOHN WARNER: Well, I think quite properly we’ve stayed away from timetables because the insurgents are carefully watching to seize upon any, any indication that we might be withdrawing substantial forces and leaving that war torn land to the devices of the insurgents. I think, yes, I believe in the 15th of December elections, there will be sufficient Sunnis; they may have had a dissatisfaction with this constitution; the new government, which will last for four years, has a mechanism by which they could change that constitution to bring more evenly into balance a framework of law that is to the liking of all three factions and is perceived by all three factions as properly allocating say the resources like the oil revenues or other means by which to hold that country together and avoid a civil war.MARGARET WARNER: Let me conclude by a question to both of you that really deals with your relationship with the Pentagon and perhaps the Pentagon’s relationship with the American people. There seems to be a subtext in today’s hearing of skepticism amongst some of your colleagues about the kinds of things they have been told in the past by Pentagon officials like these, whether it’s on US troop strength and whether more is needed or the strength of the insurgency or the training. I think Sen. Graham, Lindsey Graham, said his attitude now was one of trust but verify.Sen. Levin, do you share any of his skepticism? Do you think there’s a lack of confidence about whether the Pentagon’s really got a handle on this?SEN. CARL LEVIN: Of course. The Pentagon has been giving optimistic scenarios from the beginning. We had from the Pentagon, at least the civilian leadership in the Pentagon, the scenario before the war that we were just going to be greeted with flowers and embraces.And that rose-colored scenario and those looking through rose-colored glasses has been a consistent pattern in the Pentagon, particularly among the civilian leadership and not only the civilian leadership. So I’ve been skeptical before we even went to war that we were going to get objective assessments either from the civilian leaders in the Pentagon or from the intelligence community.MARGARET WARNER: And, Sen. Warner, how much confidence do you have in the assessments?SEN. JOHN WARNER: I have a very high degree of respect and confidence in the manner in which the Department of Defense conducts its responsibilities in Iraq and elsewhere. And I predicate that, for example, on the following: I served in the Pentagon some four or five years in the Navy Secretariat. And now Sen. Levin and I have been together 27 years on this committee with a number of secretaries of defense and chiefs of staff and others coming before us.There’s always going to be dissension between Congress and the Department of Defense. That’s the part of our democratic system of government — the ability to disagree and express our individual opinions. But I want to close with the observation made by two officers today. The first: Gen. Myers finishing 40 years of extraordinary service in uniform and he said this war is unlike anything that we have ever fought before; it’s non-state sponsored, in other words no government is behind these terrorist organizations directly.Now, maybe there’s aid going to them as we think Saudi Arabia and other governments are providing aid, but basically the al-Qaida is operating in all of the nations in the Middle East, they’re growing in strength and we have to change our tactics and do a lot of things different. And, as such, maybe mistakes are made along the way. Gen. Myers said he’d made some. But on the whole, as Gen. Abizaid, said we have no, absolutely no other course of action than to take on head on these terrorists wherever they are in the world. If we fail to do it, they will most assuredly cross our shores.SEN. CARL LEVIN: The question isn’t whether we do it; the question is whether we do it smart and effectively and are going prevail with the current strategy and I think I’m afraid that things have not gotten better with the strategy of this administration.MARGARET WARNER: All right. Sen. Levin, Sen. Warner, we have to leave it there. Thank you both.

Five questions for the week in politics By Nia-Malika Henderson, Washington Post Another busy week in presidential politics. Will Mitt Romney make a play as he heads to Iowa? And as Bachmann speaks to evangelicals, can she make the case that she’s a viable candidate? Read more
Nicaragua, Guatemala: '80s Rebels Seek Leadership By Laura Sullivan and Tom Gjelten, NPR Nicaragua isn't the only country in Central America holding elections today. In Guatemala, people are also headed to the polls to choose a new president. And in both countries, the elections are fraught with history.

America’s Deadly Dynamics With Iran By David Sanger, The New York Times Commuting to work in Tehran is never easy, but it is particularly nerve-racking these days for the scientists of Shahid Beheshti University. It was a little less than a year ago when one of them, Majid Shahriari, and his wife were stuck in traffic at 7:40 a.m. and a motorcycle pulled up alongside the car. There was a faint “click” as a magnet attached to the driver’s side door. The huge explosion came a few seconds later, killing him and injuring his wife. Read more
Two Decades After Anita Hill, Voters Shrug at Sex Harassment By Beth Reinhard, National Journal Scores of interviews with Iowa Republicans over the weekend turned up scant outrage over the sexual harassment allegations leveled against presidential candidate Herman Cain. That's partly because of the good will he's engendered among voters, and partly because of a widespread mistrust of the media, which has been extensively airing the allegations.

Presidential Crystal Balls By Doyle McManus, Los Angeles Times Unemployment is mired at 9%, and President Obama's poll ratings are mired too. Democrats are dispirited. Republicans are fired up and ready to go. Activists on both the right and the left are demanding change.

Last Man Standing? By Beth Reinhard and Alex Roarty, National Journal The question of which Republican candidate would emerge as the more conservative, more preferable alternative to Mitt Romney has loomed over the 2012 primary campaign for months. A passel of potential rivals have either taken a pass (Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, and Sarah Palin) or self-destructed (Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry). Now, Herman Cain’s spectacularly bungled response to accusations of sexual harassment threatens to torpedo his recent surge, too.

Will Herman Cain survive the scandal? By Karen Tumulty and Aaron Blake, The Washington Post There is no law of political physics that predicts what happens when the most unconventional type of presidential campaign collides with the most timeworn kind of Washington scandal.

Woman Said to Have Felt Hostility at Work After Complaining About Cain By Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny, The New York Times One of the women who accused the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain of sexual harassment while working for him at the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s complained that the workplace turned hostile after she alleged that he made advances toward her during a work-related outing, several people familiar with her account at the time said in interviews.

Israel Faces Questions About News Reports of Eyeing Iran Strike By Isabel Kershner and David E. Sanger, The New York Times Israel's top leadership has spent the week answering and evading questions about widespread reports that it is once again considering a strike on Iran's nuclear complexes, while President Obama said Thursday that he and his allies would maintain “unprecedented international pressure” on Tehran to keep it from producing a nuclear weapon.

What about Afghanistan? By Doyle McManus, Los Angeles Times Republicans usually enter a presidential campaign with a built-in advantage on at least one issue: national security. Historically, voters trust the GOP to be tougher than Democrats on defense and foreign policy.

The John Kerry Moment? By Major Garrett, National Journal Failure, it turns out, is an option. In fact, it sounds more and more like an imperative. “I’m worried you’re going to fail,” Erskine Bowles, the Democratic chairman of President Obama’s debt- and deficit-reduction commission, told the super committee on Tuesday. Hours earlier, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., told a National Journal panel on the 2012 election that he fully expected the super committee to fail and expected all of the underlying political and policy issues to be settled, at least in part, by the 2012 election.

Episode Summaries
Episode 1 Story Synopsis - Plot Revealed Below! Time has not softened Jane Tennison -- she's as bloody minded as ever -- but she's been on a losing streak and her boss, Chief Superintendent Larry Hall, has begun to wonder whether it might be a good time for her to retire. Tennison has other ideas. When the discovery of a dead woman covered in horrific torture wounds attracts big headlines she steps in and take personal charge of the murder squad. This badly ruffles the feathers of the ambitious and talented Chief Inspector Simon Finch who feels that he should be in charge of the case.
The team faces a wall of silence and suspicion as they try to investigate the murder of the dead woman, who is eventually identified as Samira Blekic, an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. Tennison's difficulties with the case are not helped by the tensions within her team. Finch is convinced that Samira's death is connected to the illegal activities of the so-called Balkan Mafia and he is determined to prove himself right. But Tennison believes that the key to solving the murder lies in the past and she single-mindedly pursues that belief.
Episode 2 Story Synopsis - Plot Revealed Below!
As she peels away the layers of truth, Tennison begins to discover the dark and terrible truth at the heart of the case and finally she identifies her prime suspect. Her investigation takes her to Bosnia where she makes an exciting breakthrough. But on her return she is dismayed to hear that her prime suspect is protected by the government and has played a key role in providing information about other Bosnian war criminals. She is told to back off -- there is no evidence of the massacre for which Tennison believes he is responsible for in Bosnia. But Jane displays her trademark determination and arrests her suspect, resulting in her own dismissal from the case. She must enlist the help of the staid Inspector Finch and defy the system to bring to justice the mastermind who has ruined so many lives ...
Detailed story description - Plot Revealed Below!
Jane Tennison is a Detective Superintendent now leading a murder squad in London. At 54 years old she must pass a medical exam to see if she's fit enough to continue serving as a police officer. But it's not just her physical fitness that is in question. She has to appear in front of a police review board made up of her boss, Chief Superintendent Larry Hall, the head of personnel and Commander of Crime Charles Evans. At the review board she is made to feel that it might be time for her to retire.
Meanwhile, Tennison's high flying junior colleague Detective Chief Inspector Simon Finch arrives at a building site where the unidentified body of a young woman has been found. Detective Sergeant Alun Simms and Detective Constable Michael Phillips tell him that the property developer found the body. Simms speculates that the dead woman might be an Eastern European prostitute as there are similarities to another recent case. Detective Constable Lorna Greaves turns up, disgruntled after having had a difficult interview with Tennison who had questioned her ability as a working mother to be a fully committed member of the murder squad. It becomes clear that the team is less than impressed by Tennison although Finch defends her.
Back at her flat, Tennison turns on the TV and sees that Finch's case has suddenly got very big -- the Shadow Home Secretary George Giblin was going to buy into the property where the murdered woman was found and he's linking her death to illegal immigrants. The next day, Tennison unexpectedly joins Finch at the victim's post mortem. Prasad, the pathologist, tells them that the victim was tortured before she was murdered -- and not only that -- she'd been tortured many years previously and the new torture wounds mimic the old ones.
Outside the post mortem, Tennison tells Finch that she is going to take over the case on the grounds that she thinks the publicity means an officer of senior rank is required. Finch is astonished but toes the line. Later, at their weekly football game, Finch complains to Hall but Hall says Tennison will come to regret her decision as it's likely to result in another failed case.
Back at the murder squad, Tennison learns at a team meeting that the dead woman has still not been identified but her photo is being distributed. Finch thinks that the murder could be linked to Eastern European organized crime; Tennison counters that he is making too many assumptions.
Finally, they get a break. Someone called Stephen Abacha rings in to identify the dead woman -- she is Samira Blekic, a Bosnian Muslim, who worked with him as a cleaner in a hotel. Abacha tells them that Samira had a sister called Jasmina, a cleaner in a hospital -- he's surprised that she hasn't come forward. He doesn't know her address and he doesn't think that the hotel will have the correct one -- they are all 'ghosts.' Stephen is the last person to have seen Samira alive; he says that when he said goodbye to her she seemed fine. Tennison swallows her pride and visits an old flame, Robert West, who is a journalist with experience of Bosnia. He increasingly becomes her source of information about Bosnia and their relationship begins to rekindle.
The search begins to find Jasmina Blekic but it is a long and difficult job for the police. Finch looks up Jasmina on the database and finds that she's connected to Kasim Ibhrahimavic, who is involved with the Balkan Mafia and cigarette smuggling. Finch decides to pursue this line of inquiry without consulting Tennison and pursues leads of his own in Customs and Excise.
Greaves' marathon session through CCTV footage finally pays off when she spots an OCB van driving near the site where the body was found. OCB is a security firm that Lane employs to do his security work. Philips goes to OCB to check it out and finds out that Duscan Zigic, a Bosnian Serb who had no reason to be near the crime site, was the driver of the van. Tennison joins Philips and they go to where Zigic is currently working. They find wire and wire cutters in his toolbox and decide to bring him in for questioning.
Zigic asks for his lawyer, Rosemary Henderson, to be present and she brings along an interpreter, Milan Lukic. Tennison puts Finch in charge of the interview but he fails to turn up anything concrete and Zigic is let go. Tennison and Finch are disagreeing about whether Zigic is a possible suspect when Finch gets a call -- his contacts have come up with a possible address for Kasim -- and Jasmina. Finch, Simms and Tennison go to the address -- it is a house full of bedsits. They knock on a few doors until they're finally directed to the correct one. It is dark and apparently empty inside. Simms and Finch go off to see if anyone knows where they are and Tennison is left alone. Suddenly she's aware of a figure emerging from under the floor with a knife -- it is Jasmina.
Tennison has just started to calm Jasmina down when Kasim appears -- he is less than welcoming. They take Jasmina and Kasim to formally identify Samira's body. When they come in for questioning, Tennison shows Jasmina Zigic's picture and asks her if she recognizes him. She asks to go to the toilet and Tennison shows her where it is, leaving Finch and Kasim alone together.
In the toilet, Jasmina breaks down and says that Zigic was supposed to kill Samira in an atrocity ten years ago in Bosnia but he spared their lives. Kasim doesn't know anything about this. Back in the interview room it has become very heated between Finch and Kasim as Finch has started to question him about his involvement in cigarette smuggling. Kasim comes to find Jasmina and tells her that they're going home.
Zigic is re-arrested at a Serb centre. Under pressure he admits that he was in a paramilitary unit but he insists that he was only a cook -- he didn't have a gun. They decide to keep Zigic in custody and check out all the sites that he had access to as a security officer for OCB -- one of them might be where he murdered Samira.
A witness comes forward and says he saw Stephen Abacha arguing with Samira shortly before they parted company on the night of her disappearance. They re-interview him and he admits that contrary to what he'd previously said, she had been frightened and had asked him to walk her home but she thought he'd misunderstood and had made a pass at her. He was offended and they parted on bad terms. They question him about the fact that he appears to have called Jasmina on the night of her disappearance -- but he says that the call must have been made by Samira without his knowledge.
They return to Jasmina's address -- the phone is in a shared hallway. They ring the number and a little girl, Haweeya, comes out of the flat to answer it. She tells them that she answered the phone when Samira called, and Samira told her to tell Jasmina that she had seen "the devil" that morning. Haweeya was too scared to say anything to anyone. They question Zigic about what he was doing at the time that Samira was on her way to work and he says he was working miles away. Despite having a good alibi, Zigic is nervous and defensive. Tennison asks Jasmina about this devil and she finally tells her about how they were tortured and raped by this devil. But he wasn't Zigic.
Without any new leads, Tennison has to take the decision to release Zigic but she decides to have him followed. She is now convinced that there is a second man involved in the murder of Samira -- someone who told Zigic to kill the girls all those years ago and who has discovered that failed to obey his instructions. She thinks that Samira saw him on her way to work. She hopes that Zigic will lead them to the devil.
Meanwhile the police discover that the property developer has kept one of his sites secret from them because he didn't want them to delay the completion date. He has just put down a new floor -- the team tell him they'll have to pull it up. While they're waiting on the forensic results, Tennison decides to act on a hunch. Zigic seemed ill at ease in the last interview and the only different thing about it was that the interpreter wasn't Milan Lukic. She goes to Lukic's place of work, an optician's, and he gives her an eye test. It is an unsettling experience for her.
The forensic results come through -- the newly discovered site was the scene of the murder and they can now link Zigic with it and with the wire that was used to bind Samira's hands. They go to arrest him but he's given them the slip. A desperate hunt begins for him -- and for Jasmina who they realize might be in danger. They go to the hospital where she works but they are too late. She is executed minutes before they arrive...

How To Form a Rebel Battalion in Syria
Follow @azmatzahraFebruary 14, 2013, 1:40 pm ET by Azmat Khan	E-Mail ThisTweet	Reporting from Syria for the London Review of Books, Ghaith Abdul-Ahad breaks it down in “five easy lessons”:
First, you need men, most likely young men from the countryside, where the surplus of the underemployed over the centuries has provided for any number of different armies and insurgencies. Weapons will come from smugglers, preferably via Iraq or Turkey. You will also need someone who knows how to operate a laptop and/or a camcorder and can post videos on the internet – essential in applying for funds from the diaspora or Gulf financiers. A little bit of ideology won’t hurt, probably with a hint of Islamism of some variety. You’ll also need money, but three or four thousand dollars should be enough to start you off.
Abdul-Ahad has made a career of reporting from the world’s most dangerous war zones. As a reporter for Britain’s Guardian newspaper, he has covered fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and most recently, Syria, where he was a correspondent for the FRONTLINE film The Battle for Syria.
Embedded with rebel fighters, his latest dispatch offers an up-close look into amplifying factions within the Syrian insurgency. It follows battalions and military councils feuding for power, weapons and money, as well as foreign support, which jihadi groups seem to have plenty of.
“Maybe we should all become jihadis,” one Syrian man laments to Abdul-Ahad about the lack of American assistance. ”Maybe then we’ll get money and support.’

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: This quilt came from my mother. She was married twice. When she married in the '40s, the second marriage, this quilt came to her then and has been around ever since I can remember. She used to have a paper that talked about the quilt, and she referred to it always as the centennial quilt. And that paper had a listing of the names of the people that had worked on the quilt, and they made this quilt in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. But that paper is long gone. And I've looked a lot and I've not found it. I notice there is one name. APPRAISER: Is that a family member or do you know who that is? GUEST: I have no idea who that name is. APPRAISER: Okay. Well, it's certainly done in the style of a Baltimore album quilt. When we first looked at it, we thought it was from Baltimore, but most of the Baltimore quilts were actually done by professional quilters, and so they're a little bit finer than yours. We can tell because of the differences in the quality and the ability of the quilters, it's made by a number of different people. If you compare this very simple block to this much more detailed block, that's certainly a huge difference in the ability of the quilter. On top of that we can see that some of the squares are actually made from different material. This one is very white, where the one next to it has more of a muslin look. Now, you mentioned that you thought that it was a centennial quilt. And I'm assuming that's because of this center piece. It's possible that it could be a centennial quilt, but just looking at the quilt based primarily on the color scheme, all these red, green and white squares, it actually looks like it's probably from 1850, as late, possibly, as 1860. I would be very surprised if it was done in 1876 for the centennial. If that were the case, I really would have thought they would put a date on here. When I look at your quilt, I can tell it's been washed at least once, because it's got this kind of puckered look. GUEST: Yes. APPRAISER: A quilt that's never been washed has a flat look, and this has been washed at least once, possibly more than that, unfortunately, and that does reduce the value a little bit. The quilt market really topped out in the 1980s, and just like the stock market and the antiques market, the quilt market is really down right now. Have you ever had this appraised? GUEST: I had it appraised once about 12, 15 years ago. APPRAISER: Uh-huh. GUEST: And that gentleman said around $300. APPRAISER: In today's market, soft as it is, this quilt for insurance value or the retail value would be somewhere between $8,000 and $10,000. GUEST: Wow. APPRAISER: In the height of the market, it would have probably been $12,000 to $15,000. On TV
