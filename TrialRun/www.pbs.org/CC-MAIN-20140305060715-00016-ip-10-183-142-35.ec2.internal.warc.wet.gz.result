A warning: This report contains some graphic footage.It was one of three known incidents under investigation into allegations that U.S. troops deliberately killed Iraqi civilians and then covered up the circumstances. All three probes pitted an early official U.S. version of events against charges by Iraqis on the ground.Today, Associated Press television news re-released this graphic on-scene footage shot shortly after the Ishaqi incident. The U.S. military had reported in March that four people died when U.S. forces, pursuing a suspected al-Qaida member, destroyed a house in a ground and air attack.Iraqi police and some local residents charged that the U.S. raid killed 11 people, most of them women and children. They also said U.S. forces deliberately murdered the Iraqis and then tried to cover up what they’d done by blowing up the building on top of the dead bodies.This Ishaqi resident, who claimed to have witnessed the event, didn’t want his face shown.ISHAQI RESIDENT (through translator): Children were stuck in the room, alone and surrounded. After they handcuffed them, they shot them dead. Later, they struck the house with their planes. They wanted to hide the evidence. Even a six-month-old infant was killed.No apparent misconductEric SchmittThe New York Times [T]his is just breaking news, as you pointed out in your report, that the military is now exonerating the troops that were involved in this incident in early March of any type of wrongful death of civilians. MARGARET WARNER: But late today, a Pentagon official told the NewsHour the investigation, quote, "didn't find any misconduct in the operation."Separately, at Camp Pendleton in California, seven Marines and a Navy corpsman are being held in the brig, pending charges in connection with the shooting death of an Iraqi man in Hamandiyah, west of Baghdad, on April 26th.And at least two investigations are under way into allegations that U.S. Marines murdered two dozen Iraqi civilians last November in the insurgent stronghold of Haditha and then provided false information about the deaths.For an update on all of these investigations, we turn to New York Times Pentagon reporter Eric Schmitt.Eric, welcome back.ERIC SCHMITT, The New York Times: Thanks, Margaret.MARGARET WARNER: This Ishaqi incident, first of all, is it official? Have these troops been cleared?ERIC SCHMITT: Well, again, this is just breaking news, as you pointed out in your report, that the military is now exonerating the troops that were involved in this incident in early March of any type of wrongful death of civilians.This has been an issue that had been reported, as you said, in March. And, again, there were disputes. But what made this interesting was these were actually Iraqi police reports that accused the American soldiers of killing unarmed women and children.So the military has gone back in and -- again, just this evening, as these press reports were resurfacing today in the new light of Haditha -- the military is now coming back to say that the Army investigation has exonerated these, but we're still pressing for more details about that.The investigation's conclusionMargaret WarnerNewsHour Senior Correspondent MARGARET WARNER: Well, two questions on that. First of all, when was this investigation concluded? I mean, did it just conclude, or was this something some time back? Well, just start with that one.ERIC SCHMITT: Again, this is unclear. Right now, this was brought to the attention of the authorities in Baghdad in mid-March, right after this incident happened, and right after the Iraqi police filed their report.It had basically been lying dormant, I think, up until that point, until, again, with the incident of Haditha providing new context for these type of incidents, suddenly this report became fresh again, and the United States and the military was forced to respond to it.Again, there weren't a lot of details about this report put out tonight. We're still trying and pressing on them.MARGARET WARNER: And is there any caution that we should say here in the fact that there hasn't been an official statement clearing them? I mean, we've all been briefed on a background basis, essentially?ERIC SCHMITT: Well, I think we're all being very careful right now in reporting this, because, of course, this was the initial response to the Haditha incident, was that this couldn't possibly be, that reports like this and reporters pressing this news were being dupes of the insurgents.So I think right now, until we see more concrete evidence coming out of the Pentagon or the military in Baghdad, we still need to be pressing those questions.Examining the investigationEric SchmittThe New York Times As for the cover-up, it's looking like at least members of the individual squad that was involved in the incident may well have passed falsified statements up the chain of command in their reporting chain... MARGARET WARNER: All right. Let's turn to the Haditha investigation, because that is the incident that's generated the most attention, obviously. Now, there are two probes going on. Where do each of those stand right now?ERIC SCHMITT: Sure, there's one of the first probes, who's conducted by -- is being conducted by Major General Eldon Bargewell of the Army. This was the inquiry that was started shortly after the initial investigating officer went to the scene in Haditha and determined there were enough inconsistencies in the Marines' initial statements about how these civilians were killed that additional investigations were warranted.So the number-two commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli, ordered this investigation by General Bargewell to determine whether or not there was essentially a cover-up of the information that came out of this.The second investigation that's going on is by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and they are actually looking at the incident on the ground, the allegations that a small group of Marines shot and killed these 24 Iraqis in the town of Haditha last November.The time frame of these investigations is a little uncertain right now. The military was hoping to present the investigation's findings to General Chiarelli as early as today in Baghdad. I'm told that has not happened, and it's going to be taking a little more time.But even after General Chiarelli receives the findings of General Bargewell's inquiry, it's probably going to be at least a few weeks before he reviews them and sends them up his command of command, perhaps back to the Pentagon, as well, before there's any public release.And we're told the second inquiry, the criminal inquiry conducted by the naval investigators, may not be completed until some time in July or later.MARGARET WARNER: Now, Congressman Murtha, as we know, was briefed by the Marine commandant and I think other Marine officials. And he has used -- in terms of the criminal side -- he has said murder was committed and, two, he has said a cover-up was committed.How far along are these investigations? Are they that far? In other words, have they determined that, even if everyone's individual culpability hasn't been decided, that there was at least some unjustified homicide committed and that there was a deliberate effort to cover up the events afterwards?ERIC SCHMITT: Well, again, military officials and congressional officials I've spoken to, who have been briefed, say they fully expect very serious charges to be filed against some number of these Marines, including homicide charges.As for the cover-up, it's looking like at least members of the individual squad that was involved in the incident may well have passed falsified statements up the chain of command in their reporting chain, so there's where you might end up in the initial stages of a cover-up.Exactly how high up the chain that goes is what General Bargewell and the Navy investigators, as well, are looking at.Haditha has unearthed incidents? MARGARET WARNER: Now, finally this third incident in Hamandiyah, and we just referred to that in the taped piece briefly. This took place, I think, April 26th, but already some Marines are in the brig in Camp Pendleton. What were the circumstances of that? And what crime is alleged to have been committed there?ERIC SCHMITT: Well, we learned last night from some of the defense lawyers who are representing these Marines that they expect these seven Marines and the Navy corpsmen to be charged with murder, kidnapping and other charges, involving the slaying of an Iraqi man in that town in April.And then what these Marines and Navy corpsmen are alleged to have done is then staged the incident and laid the dead Iraqi down and put an AK-47 next to him to make it look like he was an insurgent, when actually he was, apparently, just some Iraqi man that was killed.We don't know how many people actually participated in the killing and how many may have known about it and did not report it; that's why there's probably as many as eight people here implicated so far.MARGARET WARNER: Finally, the senior Pentagon leadership that you speak with, do they think that there are more of these incidents taking place, that they have a growing problem with their troops on the ground in any way? Or is it simply that the Haditha incident now has unearthed a lot of other disputed incidents that ordinarily would be investigated, the soldiers cleared, and we would never hear about?ERIC SCHMITT: I think, Margaret, it's a little bit of both. I think what you've seen so far is Haditha has brought to light some of the incidents that have been out there and thought were perhaps isolated or weren't given a whole lot of credence by the military.Now the military is going back and looking through their files. Human rights groups, both in the United States and in Iraq, are going back and looking at their files to see what incidents may deserve greater scrutiny.On the other hand, I think military leaders, both in Iraq and in Washington, recognize the stresses and strains that combat duty in Iraq pose. Just this week, for instance, Lieutenant General Chiarelli ordered mandatory sensitivity training for all coalition forces in Iraq right now, basically to go over things like cultural sensitivities with Iraqis, the stresses, the rules of war, and those important types of things, when you're dealing with combat situation. I think the Pentagon is looking at both those situations.MARGARET WARNER: All right, Eric, thank you so much, Eric Schmitt of the New York Times.ERIC SCHMITT: Thank you.

The Ombudsman Column
The Mailbag: Climate and 9/11 'Truth'; Two Tough Crowds
By Michael Getler
September 26, 2012
My last two columns dealt with subjects that produce a lot of heat: a PBS NewsHour segment on climate change and a pledge-drive program on Colorado Public Television (CPT12) featuring a new film by "Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth."
About climate change, I said that it is "one of those lose-lose subjects for an ombudsman in which whatever one writes is certain not to satisfy a lot of people." I could have said the same about the new film, called "9/11: Explosive Evidence — Experts Speak Out." I knew it wouldn't satisfy any of those who claim to offer evidence that the three World Trade Center buildings destroyed that awful day when hijacked airliners crashed into two of them were brought down by the controlled demolition of what the "experts" say were "pre-engineered, precisely timed and precisely placed explosives," as one put it, that had somehow been installed in these buildings.
So, this is a lengthy mailbag filled with a fair share of negative comments about what I have written in both cases. The letters posted below are a representative sampling of the mail, which amounted to more than 400 emails about the climate change segment and a few dozen about the 9/11 program.
In Self-Defense
I will make a few explanatory points first before the letters. In both of those columns, as in almost everything I write about, my primary focus is on the performance of PBS in presenting issues rather than the issue itself.
So, in the climate change piece, I said specifically that I was not being judgmental about Anthony Watts, the central figure in the controversy about the segment, other than that he was an effective spokesperson on the air and used his time well to make some strong assertions. Rather, I said what was stunning to me was that the NewsHour had picked Watts — who is a meteorologist and commentator rather than a university-accredited scientist — to represent the critics of man-made global warming. There were other aspects of the segment that I criticized, and others that I supported, but those assessments were based on the performance of the NewsHour reporter.
In the 9/11 column, the main focus was on the fact that PBS had nothing to do with this film, yet it showed up on its most-watched video list because of the local station tie-in and was being described as if it were a PBS-distributed film in several places, and the PBS logo was displayed on the A&E for 9/11 Truth website.
On both subjects — climate and 9/11 — I have personal views that I have expressed before so I felt that it was proper to disclose them again before laying out the comments on all sides and my assessment.
On climate change I said "I do believe in the assessment of the vast majority of climate scientists and U.S. and international scientific organizations that the threat to our planet . . . from global warming and the human contribution to it is real." In the column, I quoted correspondent Spencer Michels' citation of the study reporting that "97 percent of scientists" support the position that global warming and climate change are real. Although widely used in reporting on climate change, several letters below challenge that study. I did not use that particular study to back-up my own sense of this. Rather I cited a report from the National Academies Press that says: "Scientific evidence that the Earth is warming is now overwhelming. There is also a multitude of evidence that this warming results primarily from human activities . . . "
A number of emailers also commented on my use of the sentence, "On the other hand, it's not the end of the world, so to speak" in my introduction to the column on climate change. This was meant as a contrast to my opening point that this "was not the PBS NewsHour's finest 10 minutes." It was an attempt to be clever, but which I agree is open to other interpretations. The intent, as the column went on, was to point out that, aside from what I thought were some serious flaws, there were also some strong challenges and useful information presented by Michels and the NewsHour.
On the new 9/11 "Experts Speak Out" presentation I repeated what I said three years ago that, on a personal level, the idea embedded in the original programs "of a government conspiracy to blow up these buildings to be preposterous and simply beyond belief." The programs are careful to stick to engineering and not publicly blame the government but the implication one can draw from watching is not that some local contractor was hired to do this. Several letters also criticize my use of the "expert" designation in quotes as questioning credentials of those in the film. I did this because that is the language used by the A&E organization in the title of its film and it's not my place to endorse it.
First Comes Climate Change
Your column on the climate-change segment is good, but the damage is done. Is NewsHour going to make any commentary on this misleading segment? I have a 6-year-old daughter, and if we're still confusing people about whether greenhouse gases cause climate change, there is simply not much hope to avoid a great deal of suffering for her. Not the end of the world? Not necessarily. Every poorly reported piece of journalism on this subject can have tragic consequences. I do wish that more news outlets took your approach and examined how language like "believers" (which Michels repeated in his response) can mislead. I appreciate your insight in the column, but as someone who is not a scientist but reads about it enough to lie awake at night worrying, I would like to say that a column isn't good enough.

After reading and considering your posting "Climate Change Creates Storm," I'm even more convinced than after viewing the original interview that PBS has failed to provide fair coverage of climate change and the "role and rationale" of climate skeptics. The correspondent for the original TV broadcast, Spencer Michels, has allowed climate skeptics to have their cake and eat it too by failing to make clear that while someone like Anthony Watts makes fact-based refutations of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), his expertise and evidence are so lacking an empirical basis that his (and many other climate skeptics) arguments basically rely on a belief system. I will certainly grant that Mr. Watts and ACC deniers in Congress have every right to express their beliefs about the state of the Earth's climate. However, responsible, balanced journalism requires a strong statement to the effect that ACC skeptics essentially are operating without meaningful scientific support AND requires quick and robust questioning of any climate skeptic's claim that in any way relies on evidence, facts, or scientific theories. To fail to take these steps confuses the national dialogue by making it seem as if there are two reasonable sides to the science. The "skeptic" argument could be made on ideological or belief-system grounds, but to allow it to seem to be made on scientific ones is so contrary to painstaking measurements, past climate reconstruction, climate modeling, and basic physics that your TV segment represents a failure to bring the truth, as best as flawed humans can, to light. Christopher Utman, Pittsford, NY
That '97%,' a 'Falsehood' and 'Fabrication'
Re: "Climate Change Creates a Storm," there are still a couple of faults left to discuss.
1. [Physicist Richard] Muller was never truly a skeptic, thus the entire premise of the original piece is based on a falsehood. If your people had done adequate research they would know that.
2. The often cited "97% of Climate Scientists" poll is also a fabrication. The questions asked in the poll do not differentiate skeptic from CAGW alarmists, so making the claim that 97% of climate scientists believe humans are causing global warming is simply wrong.
The reaction of the CAGW crowd was no surprise. They are afraid to discuss the issues with the poorly done studies that bolster their case, and go into panic mode every time, labeling all skeptics "shills of the oil companies," which they don't bother to provide any evidence for.
Carl Fetterman, Nampa, ID

You made a valiant and sincere attempt to sort out whether Mr. Watts provided balance to the PBS segment or a trained scientist should have been selected or whether no "balance" was required. But in your analysis of the situation you have perpetuated a simple myth created by some on the "climate change is a major problem and will be catastrophic" side of the issue. That myth is that the "skeptic community" is opposed to the "97 percent of scientists who say that it [climate change] is real" to use Michel's description. To be very precise, it is 97.5% of climate scientists who answer yes to the question: "Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"
Anthony Watts like many other skeptics believes that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures because he has written that many times in many contexts. Reading the transcript of the Michels's piece, his abbreviated remarks show him to question how much warming is due to CO2 and how much is due to poor siting of thermometers and urbanization increases around measurement sites. It is plausible that one could interpret Mr. Watts as casting doubt on CO2 being a "significant contributing factor." Knowing what he has written in the past, I do not believe that Mr. Watts doubts that CO2 is a "significant contributing factor" in global warming. I believe "skeptical realists" make up the majority of skeptics despite a handful of vocal outliers and the protestations of those who wish to perpetuate the myth that global warming skeptics are anti-science. It would be nice if you and PBS did not perpetuate this same myth by insinuating that Mr. Watts is unqualified to judge climate science or that Mr. Watts' views contradict the "vast majority of scientific evidence" (your words) because they certainly do not.

I've just read your response to viewers' complaints about the uncritical inclusion of the claims of Anthony Watts in the recent NewsHour story on climate change. I appreciate that you broadly agree with the complaints, but I think when you say it's "not the end of the world" you make their actions seem misguided but justifiable. I strongly disagree. Their actions were unacceptable.
If they choose to air the views of cranks (non-climate scientists, let alone non-scientists like Anthony Watts) who deny climate change in an attempt to balance the views of legitimate climate scientists, the least they should do is add clear journalistic context, noting that Mr. Watts has been paid by the Heartland Institute, which is funded by fossil fuel interests to make it appear that there is legitimate debate over the facts of climate change, and that therefore any statements by Mr. Watts must be presumed to be biased by his financial interest in challenging the science of climate change. The NewsHour also should have followed Mr. Watts' comments about heat-island effects invalidating climate data with a note that legitimate climate scientists have repeatedly investigated and debunked these claims. In airing Mr. Watts' claims with no disclaimers, they squandered PBS' reputation and turned their story into "he-said, she-said" hype that merely contributes to confirmation bias and fails to inform.
Here's a simple way to test whether such a story is appropriately presented: think about whether, if a smart, attentive person who currently subscribes to the views expressed by Mr. Watts watched the story, they would come away thinking "well, it sounds like some of the experts agree with me and others don't," versus, "wow, it sounds like the only people who agree with me are people who've been paid by fossil fuel interests to make it sound like what the real scientists all agree on isn't true." Berkeley, CA
Shame on Me
Shame on the PBS Ombudsman. Judy Curry put it best when she wrote in her blog: "The outrage over Watts seems to be not so much what he said, as over his being given any airtime at all." The ombudsman is promoting censorship and PBS is becoming a propaganda arm for its favorite causes. Do you not trust your own readers to make intelligent choices about who and what to believe?
Philip Holberton, Pawleys Island, SC

You say: "But it seems to me that if you decide you are going to give airtime to the other side of this crucial and hot-button issue, you need to have a scientist." You did. Anthony Watts is a scientist. Scientist is not a professional title "accredited" by a university — that is decidedly non-scientific reasoning. Rather, "scientist" describes a person who follows the scientific method in his inquiries about the properties of the universe. Anthony Watts does this, and the results of his scientific inquiries have been published in peer reviewed scientific journals. Perhaps you should learn more about the man. And about science.
On the other hand, it seems to me that if you decide you are going to give airtime to someone you call a former sceptic from the other side of this crucial and hot-button issue, you need to have a former sceptic. You didn't. And you told big whopping LIES about it, like this one:
"Physicist Richard Muller had long been among those who denied that climate change was happening, but he made big news last month when he broke with his allies and published an op-ed in the New York Times saying not only was he no longer a skeptic . . ."
That statement is entirely false. Richard Muller has not "long been among those that denied climate change is happening". He has NEVER denied that climate change is happening. He is, was, and always has been a believer in "global warming." This is Muller in 2003: "Let me be clear. My own reading of the literature and study of paleoclimate suggests strongly that carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels will prove to be the greatest pollutant of human history. It is likely to have severe and detrimental effects on global climate." And in 2006: "There is a consensus that global warming is real . . . it's going to get much, much worse."
Richard Muller is not a former sceptic, he is a liar. And PBS repeats and exaggerates his lies. You say he " . . . has long been among those who denied that climate change was happening . . ." The fact of the matter is that he only even pretended to be a sceptic for about 18 months. That is not "long" and it was not real. PBS has a serious problem with journalistic ethics here, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Anthony Watts. When can we expect an essay from the Ombudsman about PBS's complicity in Richard Muller's fraud?
Wilsall, MT
(Ombudsman's Note: Here's what Muller had to say in the Times: "Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.") ~ ~ ~
You've missed the mark badly in your piece. Whatever warming earth has experienced in the last 300 years (or 50 years, you pick), there are many credible scientists who doubt that global warming is primarily (or at all) due to CO2 or to man-made CO2. If you looked into the origins of your parroted "97% consensus" would convince you it is a badly flawed figure. Besides, the so-called scientific consensus on AGW doesn't prove anything. The majority of scientists were wrong about continental drift and the cause of stomach ulcers (for two examples) for many decades before sufficient and accurate data and research showed those consensi to be wrong. So, too, it could be (and I, for one, believe it is) with global warming. There are many solid, reputable scientists you ought to look into (Richard Lindzen, Khabibullo Abdusamatov, Henrik Svensmark, Roy Spencer for a small handful) to realize that skeptics are not "shills of the energy industry" and that they do have solid science that significantly challenges any AGW conclusion. The hysteria whipped up by some climate scientists (Hansen, Trenberth) is a stain on science. I am not a climate scientist, but I do have a PhD in science, and based on the hundreds, if not thousands, of hours I have spent in the last 7-8 years digging into climate science, I am convinced it is deeply flawed in its facts, conclusions, and in its enterprise. PBS's choice of Watts as an exemplar of AGW skeptics is, I agree, questionable, when there are many solid scientists who could have been interviewed. Still, to give voice to the multitude of shrill and (mostly) badly-informed voices who believe we must "save the planet" does disservice to your role as one who ought to know what balanced coverage looks like.

As an "Ombudsman" in an important public position I would have expected you to have checked your sources before publishing any official statement. However, you seem unaware that "97% of Scientists . . ." amounts to 75 individuals out of 3,000+ "scientists who responded to a poorly worded and managed online survey. See here and here. On reading these reports I am sure you will agree that the claim "97% of Scientists agree . . . " is somewhat less impressive than it is intended to sound and will wish to add to your blog post some clarification, so that your readers are not misinformed about this matter.

An 'Ad Hominem Attack'
Your publishing of so many of the negative emails regarding Anthony Watts, most of which were filled with inaccuracies, amounts to nothing more than a thinly-veiled Ad hominem attack. It's unfortunate for the global warming believers that one well-spoken critic of their science could damage their extreme position when only given a few minutes of air time. That alone should make you question their conclusions. Also, the fervor with which they attack Mr. Watts should also give a clue to the weakness of their argument. If they were so certain and had such great science backing them, they would welcome someone like Mr. Watts so they could prove him wrong. Instead, their only desire is to quiet him and anyone else who speaks up against their position.

You referred to Watts as a "meteorologist." He is not. He never has been. He was a TV weather "personality." Not the same. At all. But you knew that already, because a whole bunch of people told you. Shame on you. Again. Still.

Thank you, Michael, for the extensive response. The issue will, however, likely not die down for nine or ninety-nine days. I hope PBS doesn't shy away from it.

I appreciate the time you have taken over this issue but I do not see any consequences mentioned; instead I see Mr. Michels "doubling down". For example, in his explanation he still promotes the "believer" meme and language: "We included the voice of a strong believer in global warming . . ." If we were offended by this in the broadcast, we are absolutely insulted now.

Thank you for considering the comments of loyal viewers and supporters of PBS, who were disappointed with, I might say alarmed by, your climate-change segment on Anthony Watts. Mr. Watts' views should have been clearly and strongly framed as coming from the sad fringe of science-avoiders. May I draw your attention to this regrettable section of your response: "I think of myself as open-minded and believe strongly in hearing opposing views. But I do believe in the assessment by the vast majority of climate scientists and U.S. and international scientific organizations that the threat to our planet and future generations from global warming and the human contribution to it is real and needs to be addressed. "Your second 'believe' above is part of the problem! This fuzzy use of a word related to something that one must take 'on faith' helps confuse those whose science-phobia is deeply entwined with their religious upbringing and subsequent fearful view of science. Nobody needs to BELIEVE in the evidence of the vast majority of scientific research on any subject. Science is fact, facts are JUST SO. We accept facts and overwhelming evidence just as we accept that we will all be older tomorrow. Your choice to use that word provides another opening through which the fringe pushes back at the progress of human knowledge. We need science now more than ever, to survive our past ignorance and poor choices.
Deborah Parker, Peekskill NY
Heartland's Billboards
I would seriously question whether you have put this issue to bed for two reasons:
Your extensive recitation of the variety of views presented during the segment ignores the significantly greater face time devoted to the opinions of a non-scientist, and the very attenuated and brief snippets of face interviews of scientists. To perform your job in a manner that reflects real world impacts, you cannot simply ignore the extremely significant difference on how the two disparate treatments are perceived by the viewer.
You did not address at all the serious questions raised by the significant contributions by Chevron and other fossil industry corporations referred to in the NY Times 2008 story that stated: "benevolent corporate underwriting of public television is 'increasingly out of step with the . . . needs of corporations as they don't sponsor public television programs for purely philanthropic reasons."
Your posting states: "As it turned out, Michels, in his blog post on Monday, revealed that Watts had been recommended to him by The Heartland Institute, that he described as 'a conservative, Chicago-based non-profit that is one of the leading groups that doubt that climate change — if it exists — is attributable to human activities.' The Heartland connection, which has included some funding, was not mentioned on the air."
Earlier this year the Heartland Institute drew notoriety for comparing those concerned with climate change to mass murderers. Their billboards were so far beyond any civilized discourse that even ultra-right wing Republicans disowned the organization and many major climate denying corporations pulled their funding after concluding Heartland had gone over the top. There does not appear to be any way that Michels could have not been aware of Heartland's notoriety. For a reporter for PBS to call such an organization for help lining up speakers is simply not something that the NewsHour, with its laser like Fire Chief focus, would ever do...unless something very significant intruded.

(Ombudsman's Note: The Heartland billboards were called attention to by a viewer in the May 4, 2012 ombudsman's mailbag.)
'A&E for 9/11 Truth' Pitches a Shutout Against the Omb
The article "The Disaster That Keeps on Giving" is certainly an interesting position for an "ombudsman" to take. It seems to be largely about how a recent program about 9/11 on CPT12 might have negatively affected PBS' image. The determination that CPT12's presentation of "Experts Speak Out" might have sullied PBS' perception as a bastion of truth, seems to have been based largely on incidental knowledge of the government's presentation of what happened on that day supplemented by a reading a 2005 Popular Science magazine article. Further, "The Disaster . . . Giving" article uses a number of elementary PR tricks to muddy the issue. For example, the article is dismissive of the extensive professional credentials of the people involved with the program, uses an imaginary (and uncomplimentary) strawman story to summarize the supposed beliefs of creators of "Experts Speak Out," and basically ignores the recent popularity of the program as a loud statement of interest from PBS' audience.
All of that is — of course — appropriate for suppressing interest in the story and as an effective way to avoid messy questions raised by the program like, "How does 13% of a building fall and crush the other 87%?" (N.B. Isaac Newton had an answer to this question in 1687 that doesn't fit the official conspiracy theory you stand so firmly behind.) Or, there is also a large statistical probability question, "How do the first three steel frame buildings ever to collapse from failures to meet events they were designed to survive collapse symmetrically into their own footprints on one day?" The article's success at avoiding these and lots of other pertinent questions does a disservice to the notion that PBS actually has an ombudsman and that he is interested in assuring responsible airing of real public questions.
I'd like to suggest that for the reasons given above the story "The Disaster That Keeps On Giving" should be retracted with appropriate apologies as unworthy of a public response from PBS' ombudsman on this issue.

You seem to think that scientists, architects, and engineers with advanced degrees and awards, such as Lynn Margulis, are dubious "experts" (your quotes), whereas the authors of the Popular Mechanics article/book (who lack similar credentials) are the real experts. The latter have been debunked every which way — but of course, without the same, big megaphone, so that you are unaware of their non-science (nonsense) when it comes to the WTC buildings.
Your dilemma is a psychological one — as revealed by your finding the ideas in "Blueprint" to be "preposterous and simply beyond belief." Unfortunately you are not alone as a "layman." Those who hide behind lies and propaganda rely on this, but this fact will not prevent qualified scientists and others from speaking out.
Try researching "Operation Northwoods" to see what our military tried to do in the early 1960s, but were stopped by Kennedy and McNamara. You must also be aware by now that the Gulf of Tonkin "incident" was a false flag operation that resulted in 50,000 dead US soldiers and 1 million dead Vietnamese. But war is a big and on-going business, and must be fueled now and again with other false-flag operations such as 9/11. These operations succeed because most citizens are like yourself, unable to judge facts scientifically, and unwilling to consider what genuine scientists have to say. But for 9/11, it doesn't take a degree to see through the many problems with the official story.

Regarding your article on PBS's broadcasting of the AE911 truth film "Experts Speak Out" you have made several errors. It is not a conspiracy film. The evidence speaks for itself. The ones who dare to criticize the official story do so at their own risk. You have to look at the evidence and not write it off as beyond the pale. You're simply helping the big lie to stand.

I support my local PBS station because I know that the programming I watch, whether locally produced or not, is true freedom of the press as opposed to the managed news that nearly all other cable networks provide. Your personal opinion ("The new film is a skillfully put-together collection of interviews and sound-bites with dozens of 'experts' supporting the idea that the buildings had to be brought down by pre-wired explosives placed inside.") is just a less-than-fully informed opinion. I would respect your opinion had you not implied that publications such as Popular Mechanics are more credible than professionals in relevant fields of STEM who must earn advanced degrees and have years of experience to get their licenses.
As a professional engineer (retired), I was trained to investigate aircraft crashes, and I have almost certainly reviewed more of the 9/11/2001 evidence more carefully than the PBS Ombudsman has. In my opinion, the "official" investigations of the incidents in New York City on 9/11//2001 were not comprehensive in any respect, and much of what has been presented to the public up to now has been little more than speculation, except for the "interviews and sound-bites" presented by the licensed experts on the AE911Truth video.
As one who has watched dozens of buildings brought down by controlled demolition, I am convinced that the three WTC buildings, in fact, could have been demolished in no other way. It is not rational to believe that buildings designed to withstand the impact of a fully loaded Boeing 707 could be brought down by a less-than-fully loaded Boeing 767, which would impart less kinetic energy under the same circumstances. The main reason airlines fly new planes is to expend less energy (money) per passenger mile. The users of most military aircraft have different priorities (destruction).
Given the space in which I must cram all of my thoughts on the subject, I can appreciate the difficulty faced by the makers of the video in presenting a sufficient amount of factual information in "interviews and sound-bites" to convince couch potatoes and ombudsmen. Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth deserve to be appreciated for simply demanding for an impartial investigation. They are not presenting a "conspiracy theory" and never have done so.

I need to take exception to several important points you raised in your commentary, "The Disaster that keeps on Giving."
First, by using quotation marks around the word experts in reference to the people in the film Experts Speak Out, you imply that they are somehow not qualified to make a professional analysis. But you give no justification for your disposition, save your trust in the opinion of Popular Mechanics' editors and staff. For example, you cite the late Prof. Lynn Margulis and Lt Col. Robert Bowman. Dr. Margulis was a recipient of the prestigious National Medal of Science and Dr. Bowman holds two PhDs and served as director of the Star Wars program under two US presidents. Why is it, again, that they are not qualified to give an analysis? You never explained that part.
Second, when citing your previous commentary, you accurately repeat the claim made by critics of the Government inquiries when you say, "someone wired these buildings with explosives intending to bring them down in this attack, and this has been covered up by the government, the 9/11 Commission and the mainstream media." But somehow you make the leap that these critics are making the claim that the Government is responsible for wiring the buildings — a blatantly false claim if you listen carefully to what these science and building professionals are saying. All of them are on record in the film and elsewhere that they are not speculating on who did it, but only who is covering it up.
You also express a concern that PBS not be associated with false theories about how and why the three World Trade Center high rises collapsed. I'd like to point out that in 2002, PBS produced a documentary "Why the Towers Fell," which put forth the since proven erroneous claim (along with a slick animation) that the buildings pancaked. On this point, AE911Truth, NIST and even Popular Mechanics all agree that this theory is false, yet to the best of my knowledge, PBS has never issued a public correction to this faulty analysis. What's that saying about glass houses and stones, again?

ConnectingHappiness	Creativity People enjoy the process of being creative and being “in the zone”—a state researchers call “flow.” Creativity and flow are linked to better job satisfaction, higher-quality leisure time, more positive emotions, and greater overall well-being and happiness. The good news is, everyone is creative—and everyone can nurture their creative side. What is creativity?
Nurturing your creativity
Common misconceptions
What is creativity?
What is creativity?
Creativity is the ability to generate new ideas and new connections
between ideas, and ways to solve problems in any field or realm of our
lives. Many of us think of creativity as making something new—like a new song, poem, painting, or novel. Creativity is certainly involved in making art. However, creativity is much more than that. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to work or solve problems in our daily lives. All people have the capacity to be creative. We can also nurture and increase our creativity. There’s a link between creativity and positive emotions and, ultimately, happiness. Researchers have found that people are more likely to have a creative breakthrough if they were happy the day before. Creativity is less likely to be present with negative emotions such as fear, anger, sadness, and anxiety; it is positively associated with positive emotions such as joy, love, and curiosity.Positive emotions and creativity make us feel interested in the world around us. The ability to be fascinated and allow ourselves to explore and discover makes us feel open and alive. It’s also what draws us to learn new skills, perspectives, and ideas—resources that we can draw on to solve life’s problems. This boosts our resilience and our satisfaction with life—both part of the equation for overall happiness.Sources:Positivity, by Barbara L. Fredrickson, Ph. D.The 6 Myths of Creativity, Fast CompanyPsychology Today
Nurturing your creativity
Nurturing your creativity
All people have the capacity for creativity. You may not think of yourself as creative, and you may even have been told that you aren’t “the creative type.” Whatever your occupation, temperament, and talents, you can nurture your creativity and create the conditions for flow. Here are some suggestions to get started:Know your strengths. Take an inventory of your talents and strengths and practice them. Even the most talented athletes and musicians practice nearly every day. Capture new ideas. Keep a notebook or voice recorder with you and next to your bed. Make it a habit to pause and jot down ideas and observations as they come to you.Challenge yourself. Flow comes from the balance of mastery and challenge. And creativity comes from thinking about challenging problems—even ones that don’t have a solution—so that new ideas can emerge. Try working on puzzles and brain teasers.Broaden your knowledge. You probably keep up with the knowledge in your occupation and hobbies. Occasionally seek out knowledge in a completely new and different area. Some of the most creative ideas have come from making unexpected connections in different fields of knowledge.Choose what to pay attention to. Flow is a state of heightened attention to the task at hand, to the point of being completely absorbed in it. Make an effort to spend time doing things that are at your cutting edge of mastery and challenge. Give yourself opportunities for flow by creating time and space free of distractions. Redesign your work to use your strengths more. As much as you can, arrange your job so that you can use your strengths. You may be able to work with your supervisor, team members, or delegate to others so that you can spend more time on tasks and projects that give you the best balance of mastery and challenge.Change your environment. Put objects in your work space—photos, clippings, comics, mementos, toys—that inspire you and make you smile, and rotate them with new ones from time to time to help inspire you to take notice.Sleep on it. Studies have found that creative solutions and new ideas really do come to us in our dreams, in the in-between state just before falling asleep, and after waking up. Collaborate. Some of the most effective brainstorming happens when individuals in a group think up and write down ideas on their own, exchange or share them with group members, and then come up with more ideas. This minimizes the competition or rejection that can happen when the whole group is generating ideas out loud together, and still allows the group to share and build on ideas.Go outside. Some research has shown that people are more innovative and creative in natural settings.Sources:Authentic Happiness, by Martin E. P. Seligman, Ph. D.The How of Happiness, by Sonja LyubomirskygradPSYCH
Common misconceptions
Common misconceptions
Only artists and other “creative types” are really creative.It’s a common misconception that there are creative “types” and that the rest of us just aren’t creative. Psychologist Robert Epstein, who has been researching creativity for decades, says: “Significant creativity is within everyone's reach—no exceptions. What's more, greater creativity breeds greater happiness. The creative process is itself a source of joy for most people. And with new creative powers we're also better able to solve the little problems that beset us daily.”Creativity is a right-brain activity.The popular idea that language and logic are “left brain” activities and creativity and emotions are “right brain” activities is an oversimplification of how our brains normally work. The idea was popularized from research that studied 40 people whose brains had been surgically severed between the left and right sides to control seizures. Most of us, however, do not have split brains. The left and right sides of our brains actually seem to work very well together, and creativity does not reside in one side or the other of the brain.True creativity is the creation of art.There are many ways to exercise your creativity, including problem solving and idea generation in whatever field interests you—any of the arts, sciences, professions, trades, avocations, and hobbies. In addition, you can nurture your creativity and reap some of its benefits just by appreciating another’s creativity—listening to music, viewing visual art, and so on.Being under time pressure can spark creativity.The opposite seems to be true. One study by Harvard professor Teresa Amabile found that people were least creative when they were fighting the clock—and for two days afterward. Amabile says, “In fact, it's not so much the deadline that's the problem; it's the distractions that rob people of the time to make that creative breakthrough. People can certainly be creative when they're under the gun, but only when they're able to focus on the work. They must be protected from distractions, and they must know that the work is important and that everyone is committed to it.”Creative types are often moody and depressed.Researchers have found that creativity is less likely to occur in the presence of sadness, anger, fear, and anxiety—and that it is more likely to occur with positive emotions, such as joy and love. One study found that people are more likely to come up with a creative idea if they felt happy the day before, and then they feel happy when they are creative. Creativity contributes to an “upward spiral” of positive emotions and greater happiness.Creativity relies on IQDefinitely not. Anyone who takes the time to learn, and especially to acquire diverse knowledge, can express great creativity.

I
Some day I will go to Aarhus
To see his peat-brown head,
The mild pods of his eye-lids,
His pointed skin cap.
In the flat country near by
Where they dug him out,
His last gruel of winter seeds
Caked in his stomach,
Naked except for
The cap, noose and girdle,
I will stand a long time.
Bridegroom to the goddess,
She tightened her torc on him
And opened her fen,
Those dark juices working
Him to a saint's kept body,
Trove of the turfcutters'
Honeycombed workings.
Now his stained face
Reposes at Aarhus.
II
I could risk blasphemy,
Consecrate the cauldron bog
Our holy ground and pray
Him to make germinate
The scattered, ambushed
Flesh of labourers,
Stockinged corpses
Laid out in the farmyards,
Tell-tale skin and teeth
Flecking the sleepers
Of four young brothers, trailed
For miles along the lines.
III
Something of his sad freedom
As he rode the tumbril
Should come to me, driving,
Saying the names
Tollund, Grauballe, Nebelgard,
Watching the pointing hands
Of country people,
Not knowing their tongue.
Out there in Jutland
In the old man-killing parishes
I will feel lost,
Unhappy and at home.

Reports The Next American System [INTERVIEW] Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood	July 17th, 2009
BLUEPRINT AMERICA
The Next American System
[INTERVIEW] Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood
President Barack Obama with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood || photo: White House
In mid-June, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, on behalf of the Obama administration, offered a temporary finance plan that, if implemented, could put off legislation to overhaul federal highway and transportation programs. It would also delay a possible vote to raise the national gas tax past the 2010 congressional midterm elections. The proposal came just a day before Rep. Jim Oberstar (D., MN), Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, released an outline of the legislation – THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009 – aimed at reforming transportation nationally.
The current transportation authorization law is set to expire at the end of September. While only an extension is supported by the Administration and the majority of the Senate, the new bill is gaining moment from members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats — and special interest groups, including the Chamber of Commerce.
But, Rep. Oberstar’s transportation bill must be heard by the House Ways and Means Committee first — and Healthcare reform, not transportation, is their mandate for the moment. Still, the Minnesotan politician is not backing down.
In May, the Secretary of Transportation talked with Blueprint America.
RAY LaHOOD || on the national plan
United States Secretary of Transportation, 2009 –
Member of the United States House of Representatives (Illinois), 1995 – 2009 BLUEPRINT AMERICA: When people say infrastructure – first of all ‘infrastructure’ their eyes kind of glaze over a little bit. But this is a very important thing – it’s like decisions on whether to put a roof on your house. When you survey the infrastructure in this country, whether it’s roads or bridges – we saw what happened in Minnesota – are we in bad shape? Are we crumbling right now, right as we speak?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, on a positive note, we are the model for the world for the interstate system. When people want to build interstate standard roads, they come to the United States. Now, some of these interstates need a lot of fixing up. And some of that’s going to take place here very quickly as a result of the Recovery Plan that Congress passed. So, we have some issues we have to deal with.
We know there’s a lot of bridges around the country that need to be repaired and fixed up. They meet the standards, but they still need to be fixed up. To put it bluntly, currently, America is one big pothole. And everybody knows it. It’s not just in the big cities; it’s all over the countryside. We think the Stimulus Bill and our portion of it – $40 billion – will go a long way to help fixing potholes, fixing roads, fixing bridges and building some new ones, too.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: To what extent when you talk about fixing infrastructure – to what extent are we talking about fixing what we have and to what extent is it time, perhaps, to think about rethinking things?
Ray LaHood
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, it is time to rethink things because moving through Congress is a bill to provide the money for infrastructure and for new ideas for the next five years. It’s called the Authorization Bill, the Highway Bill, traditionally. This is our opportunity right now in the history of building infrastructure to think outside of the box on how we’re going to fund things, how we’re going to move people around communities, how we’re going to move people between communities and whether it’s going to be light rail in communities, buses in communities, bike paths in communities, people walking and opportunities for people to get out of their cars, get out of the congestion and really have opportunities for more livable communities.
We’re at a very critical moment in the history of our infrastructure needs in America… And people are thinking about that now.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Do you really think so? Do you really think Americans are ready to get out of their cars?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Absolutely. I really do because I think people are fed up in getting stuck in traffic – whether it’s in Washington, DC, or Peoria, Illinois. It’s true everywhere. Because everybody has two or three cars. Everybody has been accustomed to driving two or three cars. And now people are thinking, ‘You know, maybe I could ride my bike to work. Maybe I could get on a bus and ride it.’ People have found that when gasoline prices went up, they got on a bus or they got on a light rail line. They found it comfortable, efficient and cost effective. And, even when gasoline prices went down, people are still getting on buses, trains, light rail and riding their bikes to work.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: To what do you attribute this sea change? Was it the gas price spike we saw and, in my sense at least, is that Americans have a short memory when it comes to gas prices. We did, after all, go through a terrible convulsion in the 70s and we forgot that pretty quickly, didn’t we?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: I think people don’t have short memories to this extent – I think when gasoline prices went up, people did start finding other alternatives and even when gas prices have come down, they’ve stayed with some of those alternatives. And I think they will because of what I said earlier. I think it’s a big headache for most people to get to work, to get to their doctors’ appointment, to get their children to school. It’s a pain.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Yeah, but you can’t do that on a bicycle…
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: You can’t do it on a bicycle, but you could do it on a bus. And, obviously, you could do it…
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Come on, are the soccer moms really going to trade their minivans for a bus?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: I think there are a lot of people that are thinking about different ways of doing these things. I really do.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: We are really good road builders, aren’t we?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: We are… state of the art. We’re the model for the interstate system. We’re not the model for high speed trains because we haven’t done it. And we’re not the model for other modes. Even though Amtrak ridership went up when gasoline prices went up, it stayed up and Amtrak ridership is still very high – efficient, comfortable and pretty reasonable.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Yeah. I took the Acela down today. Love it. Love the service. But it’s a very small piece of the very big pie. And a lot of people would say, ‘You know what? This is a big continental country. It’s not really ideally suited for that kind of transportation.
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: It’s not bigger than Europe… and look what’s going on in Europe – high speed rail. People get on trains and they can be in one part of Europe to another part of Europe in 90 minutes – going over 200 miles an hour. We’ve never made those investments, but we’re about ready to make those investments. And you go to other cities that still have their streetcars, that still have their buses and you go to some Asian cities and you see people on little motorbikes or riding bicycles. And it works.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: To what extent have your predecessors and the administrations they represented incentivized this car culture that we’re all about, and, in a sense, created the sprawl which is all around us?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, look, if Eisenhower decided to invest all of this money or set the bar very high for developing the interstate system or developing a high speed rail, we’d have high speed rail. They went the other way. They decided we were going to have an interstate system. For whatever reasons. There’s a lot of different reasons for that. And because of that, every subsequent administration, every subsequent Congress, every subsequent DOT secretary has put all their eggs in one basket. This administration is thinking outside the box. The president personally made sure there was $8 billion in the Recovery Plan for high speed rail. More money than we have every had in the history of the department for high speed rail.
We are sending out the door $8 billion so people can buy new buses, build bus opportunities for people in communities that have never had them before. So, we’re thinking about transit, we’re thinking about high speed rail more than has ever been thought about before.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Why do you think we’ve put so many eggs in the car basket, if you will?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Convenience. People like cars. I think the convenience, the independence that it provides. You don’t have to go by a certain schedule or wait a certain amount of time to do it. But, I think bus companies and transit districts and train operators have learned a lesson from that in terms of really providing convenience and comfort. It’s the convenience and comfort that is the reason that people get in their automobiles. But, there’s a lot of frustration to date with that, too. And all you have to do is drive around Washington or New York or Chicago or even smaller communities and get very frustrated being behind the wheel.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: It’s broken… The infrastructure that we have here – the roads, the system – is it broken?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: There are way too many people in automobiles and there are way too many automobiles. And so it has caused the kind of headaches and heartaches and backaches and every other kind of ache that you can think of for people who are driving around these cities today. And we’re going to change that. This administration is going to change that. Because this is the kind of change that people want.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Should we pave our way out of this mess? Is it past the time to be thinking about building roads on any sort of grand scale?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: We need to continue to maintain the roads we have, but we need to put a lot of our resources into other alternatives. Like buses, like light rail, like Amtrak, like streetcars, like bike paths. And give people some other options and some other alternatives.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: The thing that impresses me about the car is that the car is the perfect extension of everything that Americans hold dear. We talked about it – independence and freedom and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it. There’s no substitute for that is there?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, we can create those substitutes, I think. I think we can create them in communities the size of Washington. We can create them in the communities the size of Chicago or New York and we’re about ready to do that. And it’s not just us here in Washington. There are people out in these communities who believe that there should be other modes of transportation other than getting in your car. And the other thing that we should note here is gasoline prices are going to go up. When the economy starts to surge again, a price of a barrel of oil is going to go up and the price of a gallon of gasoline is going to go up. And it’s going to happen. We know these things are cyclical.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Do you ever listen to Car Talk on the weekends – Click and Clack?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: I don’t.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Well, when the prices went down, they got on a real rant about, ‘This is the time to raise the tax, because we won’t notice it so much.’ Their point is , we do have – historically – very low gas taxes compared to what they pay in Europe. Is it appropriate to be thinking about raising the gas tax to have it properly pay its due for what it does to the environment, the roads and everything else, and also to fund some of these things you’re talking about?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, we’re not in a mode to raise gasoline taxes. America’s hurting. There’s a lot of people out of work. There’s a lot of people who can’t make their house payment or buy groceries, and raising the gas tax is not an option for us, really. There are other ways that we can do the things we want to do. We can toll roads. You can toll bridges. You can have some private money invested in some of these infrastructure things that we want to do. We’re talking about creating an infrastructure bank that allows you to raise a lot of money without raising taxes. But we’re not going to raise taxes.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Not going to happen?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Not going to happen.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: That’s a third rail item…
I assume you’re thinking about a lot of fancy fast trains, connecting big cities. What else do you see if you were to paint your vision for a transportation future for this country? What would it look like?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, I’ll use as an illustration a couple of things. In Miami, they built a lane along 95 and they paid for it by the tolls that are collected for that lane. And that gives them extra capacity on that road. In Houston, they have a light rail that goes from downtown where people – who can’t afford a car, poor people, people that are maybe living paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to get to the huge medical complex that they have at the other end of town – can get on a light rail system. It’s very efficient, it’s very cost effective.
So, what we’re saying is that even if you don’t have an automobile, we ought to develop other options for people to be able to get to the hospital, to get to the doctor, to get to the grocery store. And those options are there. And there’s a way to pay for them. The Infrastructure Bank that I talked about – where you set aside money, it earns interest and that money is dedicated to certain kinds of projects. Public-private partnerships… We need some private investment. There are people out there that are willing to make the price. So, public-private partnerships are another thing that has worked in certain parts of the country. We need to think outside the box other than just the Highway Trust Fund and we simply cannot raise taxes.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Now, you mentioned Amtrak – how is it different now?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Amtrak is doing very well.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: But historically, it’s struggled…
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: But the path forward is very bright for Amtrak. It really is. Their ridership is up. They purchased new equipment. They’re efficient. They’re on time. And they’re pretty cost effective. You can get on an Amtrak train – particularly on the Northeast Corridor and go to any of these cities and it’s pretty cost effective. Amtrak lines in Illinois run from Chicago and deliver students from the suburbs to Western Illinois University, Southern Illinois University – which is a six-hour drive, by the way – to Galesburg, Illinois, where Knox College is. So, these Amtrak lines have really improved. And, they’ve done it because, as ridership has increased, they’ve been able to put money back in to infrastructure, to new cars, to a more comfortable ride for people. Amtrak’s well on its way to becoming, I think, a very, very efficient, comfortable, cost-effective way for people to travel.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Would you concede, though, that over the years it’s been under-funded and under-supported by the government?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Congress has really tried to hold Amtrak’s feet to the fire and they’ve gotten the message. And, I congratulate them – for stepping up, improving service, improving efficiency, and really trying to provide the kind of ridership that people now have become accustomed to and that they’re using it.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: So, are you convinced then, that with the right kind of partnership and the right mix, the private sector would jump at the opportunity to get involved in rail projects in this country?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: There’s no question about it. I just met with a group from the West Coast that’s willing to raise 80 percent of the money if we will leverage part of our money to build a high speed rail line from Nevada all the way over to California. They have a plan put together. They know they have to meet all the environmental standards. There is money out there in the private sector – particularly on high speed rail – because the investors know that if you build a good high speed rail, you can make money at it and people will use it. Just the way they’ve done in Europe and in Asia.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: But, they’re so expensive to build. I mean, can you really make a buck doing this?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: You absolutely can. And I think that when you look at the European model and you look at the Asian model, they’ve proven that you can have high speed rail – you can do it in a way where the government pays part and the private sector pays part, and you can make money at it.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: That would potentially change the landscape, if there’s money to be made.
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Twenty years from now, you’re going to see at least three or four corridors of high speed rail in America that does not exist today – thanks to the vision of the President and thanks to the vision of people in the country who are willing to make the investments. But, we are right on the cutting edge of having high speed rail in America.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Where are those corridors?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: The West Coast, the central part of the country, the Midwest, the Northeast Corridor and the South. There’s at least five corridors right now that are in different phases of opportunities to begin. California’s way ahead of the curve. They’ve been planning high speed rail for 20 years. They’ve passed a referendum. They have money sitting in a bank to help leverage some private dollars and to help some of our dollars. And, so, they’re pretty far ahead. The Midwest has got a pretty good plan… So, there are some opportunities in America.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: What about those who say, ‘But wait a minute. We have built a suburban sprawl car-based society here and you’re inserting rail into this picture? And rail is ideally suited for the old cities in the Northeast with the population clusters and centers.’ Does rail really work when you lay that on top of the landscape of sprawl?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Well, as I said, I was in Houston recently. They have a whole plan for connecting the suburban area with the inner city of Houston, where people can use light rail to come from 10 miles out into the city.
There are plans in some of the big cities that enable people to use these light rails. Washington, DC, is a classic example. The Metro system here could not exist if it hadn’t been for the foresight of people who said, ‘We got to get people out of automobiles and into the city to get to work and back to the places where they want to live.’ And this is a pretty classic example of something that has worked pretty well. And other cities are really looking at it.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: We had a nice conversation with the mayor of Portland – obviously, they’re big on streetcars and trolleys there. And those were built very much in spite of the Federal government. I’m not talking about your tenure, of course. We’re talking about your predecessors here. They almost had to fight the government to make this happen. Because the money came just absolutely greased for roads. And basically, they had to build it themselves. What are your comments on that, first of all? Should Washington be dictating – one way or another, whether it’s roads or rail – what localities do?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Portland’s way ahead of the curve. They are the example of a livable community. They’re the example, and we want to replicate that in other communities around the country. The streetcar system that they’ve developed – we’re going to put some dollars into it. We’re going to be making some announcements. We’re going to be going out there with the folks that have been way futuristic with this. And so, what we’re trying to do is look forward. We’re looking through the windshield, we’re not looking in the rear view mirror.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: Yeah, they’re actually building streetcars there.
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: Exactly.
BLUEPRINT AMERICA: But philosophically, should Washington one way or another be telling localities how to spend their money on transportation? How should that work?
SEC. RAY LaHOOD: That’s the old way of doing it. I mean, we do provide a lot of the resources here in Washington. But we know now that we don’t have all the resources and we don’t have all the smart people here. People are going to decide in their communities how they want to get around their communities and we ought to be able to supplement their good ideas and their dreams and their ideas for how they want their communities to look. And I think that is the way forward – I really do.

These are some very positive plans but I think it is wishful thinking to think that we can fund mass transit without raising the gas tax and redirecting the money to mass transit or even tax rebates.
The NYC MTA is facing a fiscal crisis as are Transit systems all over the country. Transportation for America, http://t4america.org , lists 94 transit systems which have been cut or facing service cuts.
Here in New Jersey, New Jersey Transit, which basically actually serves as “New York Transit” and limits its vision to carting commuters into and out of New York City, cut 30% of the Morris/Essex line’s Hoboken service in May, 2008.
NJ Transit has several lines with NO SERVICE on the weekends and primarily peak hour weekday services only. The same with Maryland’s MARC system and many systems around the country.
Contractors make money on building new train stations, lines etc. Actually OPERATING those lines and stations on the other hand costs money which does not line the pockets of contractors but only fulltime transit conductors, engineers, bus drivers, etc. Operations costs for frequent service on existing systems should be funded from gas taxes.
Despite the optimistic talk about Europe’s “public-private partnerships” I do not believe any transit system funds its operating costs without government subsidies which come from gas and other vehicle taxes.

The only way to fund new investment in infrastructure – and to make the right investments – is through the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank. In our recently released study we show that the US currently invests only about 1.3% of GDP in infrastructure, and needs to invest 3% (the same level we invested in 1980). Without the NIB, by 2030 China annually will be investing 3 times what we invest in infrastructure, and the EU will be investing double our investment — from a high of 30% of global infrastructure investment we will have fallen to a level below 10%.

Dear Sir.This letter is to inform everyone that some one does not have his head in the sand, and does not understand anyone who claims to be helping. So buckle up lets go for a ride in the slimcar what this car can do is end these parking lots we call highways,end energy waste,end road an highway projects,end new bridge and tunnel ideas,end our addiction to oil so our children and there children might breath. The slimcar will be narrower in width so as to allow two lanes to become three across and three lanes to become five across. This like ezpass will create flow and end bottle necking which is costing us millions everyday not to mention the break dust and exhaust. This is not a right or left wing issue but a moral one, everyone will not be taxed and it wont cost you more. This will save fuel this will save travel time this will save wear on your car and soul, just think of your car minus the console or arm rest. What we see down in the Gulf should be a warning sign that we have gone to far, the blame game will bring nothing to the table. And in the next breath they speak of nuclear alternatives. Thank You, Brian P. Kelly
