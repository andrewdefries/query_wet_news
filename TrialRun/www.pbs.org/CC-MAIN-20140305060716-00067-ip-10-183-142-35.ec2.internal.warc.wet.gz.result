Charles Shaw
Survivor (Born 1936)
Hazel and Charles Shaw. Boise City, Oklahoma. 1936. Credit: Lucas-Shaw Photo Collection
Charles Shaw was just shy of two when his family left the heart of the Dust Bowl to put down roots in Vici, Oklahoma. He'd been born in Boise City on March 26, 1936, the second child of Charles and Hazel Lucas Shaw. The family moved to Vici in late 1937 when father Charles, a mortician, learned that the funeral parlor there was up for sale. "Dad bought it for $500," Charles remembers.
A basketball and baseball letterman for the Vici Indians, Charles's real love was music. He attended Panhandle State in Goodwell on a vocal scholarship, graduating in 1958 with a bachelor of science degree in business. After marrying the love of his life, Joy, Charles followed in his father's footsteps and became a mortician. He was an inaugural teacher in the nation's first degreed mortuary science program. Later, Charles returned to Vici and took over the family business, with help from his mother Hazel. "People always requested that Mom do the obituary," he smiles. "She was such a good writer and knew and loved people so well."
Hazel died in 2003 at the age of 99. Just two years earlier, Charles had retired, having sold the funeral home to a family friend. Since that time, he and Joy have traveled extensively – from Bora Bora to Budapest. From the 1980s on, they've toured America in a tricked-out RV, visiting their three children and all fifty states. "Mind you," he grins, "we didn't take the RV to Hawaii."
Music has always been a big part of Charles's life, including singing and playing the trombone in the high school band.

So Much So Fast
Apr. 03, 2007
90 minutes
When he was 29 years old, Stephen Heywood was diagnosed with ALS -- also called Lou Gehrig's disease -- and told he had two to five years to live. But Stephen and his family refused to accept the doctors' death sentence. So Much So Fast follows the Heywoods' passionate, acerbic, and relentlessly hopeful reaction to a disease that transforms their lives. Stephen's older brother, Jamie, starts a foundation dedicated to finding a cure through fast-paced guerrilla science that attracts both praise and controversy. Stephen gets married and he and his wife, Wendy, have a son. They confront the encroaching paralysis of ALS with a mix of courage and humor, and, surrounded by friends and family, upend the cliches of their situation. From Oscar-nominated (Troublesome Creek) filmmakers Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan, So Much So Fast tells a haunting story of one family's unexpected answers to some of life's biggest questions.
