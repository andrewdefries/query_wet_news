An Icelandic group called the Hrauvinir claims that ancient elves of Iceland would be disturbed by the construction of a proposed highway. Photo by Christian Bickel/WikipediaYou may have heard the word “elf” mentioned a lot this holiday season, whether in reference to Santa’s helpers or characters from the latest installment of “The Hobbit” movie franchise.But in Iceland, where elves are part of the national folklore, the word “elf” has a more serious connotation. An Icelandic group called the Hrauvinir, or “Friends of the Lava,” have joined with environmentalists to seek an injunction from the country’s Supreme Court against a building project by the Icelandic Road and Coastal Commission which was green-lit in September.The government agency is trying to build a new highway from the Alftanes peninsula (where a property owned by the President of Iceland is located) to Gardabaer, a suburb of the capital city of Reykjavik.In addition to arguments about the environmental impact of such a project, the Hrauvinir also claim that the road work will disturb the “Huldufolk” — or “hidden folk” — the ancient elves of Iceland.The group also claims the area the new highway would run through is of particular importance because it contains an elf church.A 2007 survey by the University of Iceland found that while only 8 percent of the population believe in elves, 54 percent would not actually deny their existence.The belief in elves is widespread enough and the objections to road work projects that might disturb ancient elf habitats so frequent, that the Icelandic Road and Coastal Commission has written a boilerplate, standard reply for any press inquiries on the subject, saying it will not answer questions on whether its “employees do or do not believe in elves and ‘hidden people’ because opinion differs greatly on this and it tends to be a rather personal matter.”In an interview with the Associated Press, Terry Gunnell, a folklore professor at the University of Iceland who ran the 2007 survey, said that the stories of elves and otherworldly beings is part-and-parcel with landscape and natural forces of Iceland.“This is a land where your house can be destroyed by something you can’t see (earthquakes), where the wind can knock you off your feet, where the smell of sulfur from your taps tells you there is invisible fire not far below your feet, where the northern lights make the sky the biggest television screen in the world, and where hot springs and glaciers ‘talk,’” Gunnell said.“In short, everyone is aware that the land is alive, and one can say that the stories of hidden people and the need to work carefully with them reflects an understanding that the land demands respect.”Andri Snaer Magnason, an Icelandic environmentalist also interviewed by the AP, said that while some people might think the elf controversy is “a bit annoying,” rationality is relative.“I got married in a church with a god just as invisible as the elves,” she said. “So what might seem irrational is actually quite common [with Icelanders].” SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERfeature PREVIOUS POSTOutdated technology makes U.S. consumers easy target for credit card hackersNEXT POST What we’re watching Monday Are you aware of our comment policy?Beginning October 24, 2012, PBS NewsHour will allow open commenting for all registered users.

The group analyzed data from 181 countries and found that maternal deaths are still heavily concentrated in a handful of countries.India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo accounted for half of the maternal deaths in 2008. But India was also part of the select group, including Egypt, Romania, Bangladesh, and China, that substantially decreased their maternal mortality rates in the last 20 years. The PBS NewsHour looked at how Peru is encouraging more rural women to give birth in medical facilities to reduce deaths in a report last month. Plus, you can watch a NewsHour slideshow on the high maternal mortality rates in Tanzania here and find a Human Rights Watch video on maternal mortality in India here.In an editorial accompanying the publication, editor Richard Horton said the new figures, “provide robust reason for optimism” and called for continued focus on the issue to reduce maternal deaths even more.“Two decades of concerted campaigning by those dedicated to maternal health is working. Even greater investment in that work is likely to deliver even greater benefits,” Horton wrote.But not everyone thinks the study will help the maternal health cause. The New York Times reported Tuesday that the study’s author said there was pressure by some advocates to delay the publication because it would “detract from the urgency of their cause.” Other advocates say the data should be looked at as only one piece of the puzzle.“On the face of it this would seem to be quite a remarkable change, it’s rare to see a decline like that in any health indicator,” said Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women’s Health Coalition. “But this is one indicator of maternal health, it’s not the only indicator, so to get a better measure we need a wider range of data.”Germain said serious injury and illness are also factors in maternal health progress, and that the accuracy of data on maternal deaths can vary widely from country to country.“A lot of [pregnant] women are still dying at home alone, with nobody to record that death,” Germain said.The study points to several factors that have likely contributed to the improvement in the data, including women having fewer children in their lifetime, as well as increases in income level per person and level of maternal education in some countries. A rise in the number of women giving birth with a skilled attendant is also credited for improving birth outcomes.Progress overall could have been much greater, the Lancet said, if the HIV epidemic had not contributed to jumps in maternal mortality in eastern and southern Africa. In the absence of HIV, there would have been 281 500 maternal deaths worldwide in 2008, the study concluded.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the important connection between HIV and maternal health in a speech earlier this year. Clinton stated that one of the goals for the administration’s new Gobal Health Initiative is “integrating family planning, maternal health services, and HIV/AIDS screening and treatment, so that women receiving reproductive care will also receive HIV counseling, and will be referred to an HIV clinic if they need one.” SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERAudio Slide Shows Global Health GlobalHealth HealthBeat PREVIOUS POSTObama Calls for More Control Over Financial DerivativesNEXT POST Seismologist: China’s Quake Severe But Not Unusual Are you aware of our comment policy?Beginning October 24, 2012, PBS NewsHour will allow open commenting for all registered users.

Posted by Gina on August 18, 2009 at 9:22 AM in Picture Books, Recommendations, Show and Tale
Welcome to Show and Tale, a new Tuesday feature from Booklights. Each week, we'll be asking a quick question about books: your all-time favorite, your current read, the bedtime story your kids ask for every night. We're starting out with a simple but hard-to-pick-just-one question: What's your favorite children's book and why? Here's what the winners of our recent book giveaway at the BlogHer conference said:
Esther picked Brown Bear, Brown Bear from Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carl. "I've got great memories of my third-grade teacher reading it to our class."
Cindy picked Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus from Mo Willems. "My 2.5 year old loves it because she gets to say 'NO, PIGEON' on every page."
Susan picked Richard Scarry's What Do People Do All Day?. "It shows moms and dads working in and out of the home."
And Miss Lori, a familiar face to preschool fans of PBS KIDS, named her favorite, The Giving Tree, in this chat with Supersister Kristen:
So what's your favorite and why do you love it? Tell us below for a chance to win free books from Booklights. Comments (8)

Goodnight Moon is my family's favorite book. My husband and I have read it to all of our four children. I think we are on our third or fourth copy! All of us have that book memorized and could tell the story in our sleep! Our youngest at three years old still enjoys reading the story!

I couldn't begin to pick one favorite picture book. However, one of the favorite read-alouds in library is Mouse Mess by Linnea Riley. It is one of the first books I read to first-graders during their visits to library. They love the colorful pictures of the mouse doing everyday activities using kitchen utensils -- raking up cornflake leaves with a fork, bathing in a teacup. The rhyming text is an added delight. Most of all, the children love being able to predict the last line of the story using the rhyming words as their clue.

Since you've given picture book examples I'm going to stay in that vein and say Knuffle Bunny. But it's really, really hard to pick just one.

Ones I like reading to my kids (and they like hearing): anything by Mo Willems, Snowy Day by Ezra Jack Keats, Where the Wild Things Are or In the Night Kitchen, and The Very Hungry Caterpillar.
I could go on, but I won't.

My favorite children's book is Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm by Alice and Martin Provensen. It is a wonderful story describing the personalities of all of the animals the children live around on the farm. It isn't cutesy, it is loving descriptions of real animal behaviour, good and bad. There are so many wonderful sentences, and great illustrations. It feels like the children are taking you around the farm and introducing you to all of the animals. My children loved quoting the best lines and I found it perfectly enchanting.

I love the Virginia Lee Burton books, particularly The Little House. I contemplate the lessons of that story as I drive through suburbia to my own "little house." The illustrations are beautiful, and capture the essence of a house as a living entity.

"Love you Forever" by Robert Munsch. I loved it, my children loved it and my students loved it.It brought tears to my eyes EVERY time I read it.A little boy who experiences true, unconditional love from his mother cares for her when she is old, and sings to her the same song she sang to him when he was little...I'll love you forever......"

My favorite growing up was probably Wacky Wednesday!! I loved that book, trying to find all the wackiness!!
My son's current favorite is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or What's New At The Zoo?: An Animal Adding Adventure. It really depends on his mood!!

I Am Neda
30 Jul 2009 13:56Comments
I Am Neda Leave the Basiji bullet in my heart,
fall to prayer in my blood,
and hush, father
-- I am not dead.
More light than mass,
I flood through you,
breathe with your eyes,
stand in your shoes, on the rooftops,
in the streets, march with you
in the cities and villages of our country
shouting through you, with you.

Episodes Harlem in Montmartre Historian Tyler Stovall on Montmartre	Harlem in Montmartre
Historian Tyler Stovall on Montmartre
Tyler Stovall explains the African American community centered around Montmartre outside of Paris, a community filled with key players in black literature and music. Next: Watch and listen to Tyler Stovall recall the days of Bricktop’s.
Tyler Stovall: Paris was a tremendous amount of fun in the 1920s. I mean, after all, this is the decade of the Lost Generation, of, you know, mostly white artists and writers who, you know, gave up everything to come to France and live the good life.
And so, African-Americans when they came to Paris – if they met other black Americans – they would be told generally, “Well, the only place where there really is a concentration of our people is in Montmartre. And that is because of the jazz clubs. So if you want to meet other black Americans, wait until the sun goes down and then go to these jazz clubs and stay there basically until the sun comes up.”
Ok, Montmartre was and is to this day a distinctive Parisian community. It was as early as the early 19th century a place where because it lay beyond the city walls, alcohol was cheaper there because it didn’t have to pay the tax to go into Paris itself. So there were lots of speakeasy- lots of speakeasies, and lots of bars and cafes there. So it had- by the time African-Americans came in there- came there in the 1920s it had a tradition of over- almost a century of being a place where one went to enjoy good times.
There were tales of a so-called shoeshine boy, an African-American man who worked with the American Express outside Paris, who whenever he met African-Americans coming through would tell them – “Go up to Montmartre. That’s where our people are.”
Ok, these writers- people- the writers that came from America. Writers like Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay – basically the cream of the crop of the Harlem Renaissance who came during the 1920s were attracted to Paris for several reasons. They were attracted because of its literary prominence, above all. They were attracted by the fact that it was one of the greatest cities in Europe. And increasingly, they were attracted by the fact that so many of their colleagues also seemed to be coming to Paris in the summer.
So, they did represent something different. And yet at the same time, there was a strand of the writing of Harlem Renaissance writers – and you find this especially in Claude McKay – that celebrated a certain kind of primitivism. Claude McKay writes his groundbreaking novel Banjo – actually it’s set in Marseilles in the late 1920s – and it really celebrates the primitive, the idea of the non-intellectual. And it’s full of contradictions, of course, because it’s written by an intellectual. And it includes a self-portrait of Claude McKay as one of the primary characters.
Josephine Baker also falls into the whole primitivist narrative. In fact, there’s an interesting little piece by a woman named Paulette Nardal. Paulette Nardal was one of the famous Nardal sisters who really helped create the Negritude movement and brought together African-American, African and Caribbean writers. And at one point she called- she wrote an essay called Exotic Puppets, which was basically a hatchet job on Josephine Baker. And she talked about this little half case from St. Louis shaking her butt on the Paris stage.

Is there any way that I can purchase Harlem in Montmartre Paris for my French classes?
Ellyse Adele Vitiello
Dear Tyler, did your interests carry over to post WWII Paris? Do you know of Honey Johnson & Herbert Gentry in Paris from 1946 – 1956? Thanks. EAV
George
What is the name of the group playing the music in the current clips? Are they recording?
maggie
Who were the musicians recreating the music? Their names went by in a flash. What an oversight!
Irving M. Koenig
Both my wife and I enjoyed the program very much. The musicians recreating the music were great. Who did the commentary? Her voice was very familiar to me.
Leatrice Schacht
No way to read the credits and find out about the wonderful musicians
Annette
Please provide a place where we can read the credits. I’d love to dig deeper into some of the books and music.
Otherwise: Great program. I enjoyed it immensely.
Judith
Loved the program.Loved it! Credits should honor the people who worked on this production and allow the viewing public to know them and honor them. No way we could honor them with that speeding lines at the end.Give us that information. This is why I came here this a.m. to find out.Commentary sounded like S. Epatha Merkerson but that could be that I am Law and Order Junkie when jazz is not playing.
tom
Who were the musicians?
Frank
As everbody says, where can we read the credits? In particular, who was the jaw-dropping modern day Django Reinhart?
mercy

Patrick Lang
I would like to purchase the DVD of this program.
greta gonzalez

Avon
The program was scheduled for Wednesday evening on KCET Los Angeles, CA. It was dropped without any explaination nor was there any announcement as to when the program will be scheduled again. I especially wanted to see it because I visited Paris quite often when I was stationed in France with the Air Force from 1959 – 1962. The Left Bank near Place Ste. Michelle was the place to go to see and hear Jazz of that era.
Hans Apisaloma
When will Great Performances: Harlem in Montmarte be shown? It was supposed to be aired Wed. 8/26/09 at 8 pm in Honolulu PBS Hawaii.was dropped with no explanation. Please Bring it on!

charles wizen
Most of your program was very enjoyable but for the guitarist and violinist really not up to par;why not use Bireli Lagrene on guitar and Florin Niculescu on violin they are at the present the best players in this style;sorry.
Troy Wheeler
Caught the program early this morning. Was familiar with much of the history regarding jazz. Can’t wait to purchase the dvd when it becomes available. I highly recommend Michael Dregni’s “Django” The Life and Music of a Gypsy Legend. It is a fantastic book.

Hey, those who want to know the cast – don’t hold your breath for an answer: PBS only cares about you during Pledge days.
But… IMDB has some of the cast here:

Read the transcriptTRANSCRIPT
Tavis: Lisa Jackson is the newly appointed administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, the first African American to hold the post. Prior to joining the administration she served as chief of staff for New Jersey Governor John Corzine. She joins us tonight from Washington. Administrator Jackson, nice to have you on the program.
Lisa Jackson: Oh, it’s an honor to be here, Tavis, thanks so much.
Tavis: Can I start by saying congratulations?
Jackson: You absolutely may, and it feels good – it really does.
Tavis: Congratulations, then. Much has been made about the fact, and I just referenced it a moment ago, that you are, of course, the first African American woman – first African American, period – to be head of the EPA. From your perspective, because I want to ask you about that, from your perspective what does that mean, if anything?
Jackson: Well, I’m fond of saying that the president, in nominating me and then when I got confirmed, literally changed the face of environmentalism in this country. Still today in the year 2009 some people think that the environment is not an issue for people of color, and I hope that if nothing else I’m a very vibrant symbol of the fact that people of color should see themselves in the environmental movement. It’s extraordinarily important to them and their families.
Tavis: Indeed we should. And you also know, having done this for so many years, that there is a distinct difference, though, in terms of politics, between symbolism and substance. You know that very well, the distinction between the two, symbolism and substance.
I guess the question is whether or not, on the substance, since there was not a lot of conversation during the campaign about the environment in terms of environmental racism where people of color are concerned, what say you about that as administrator?
Jackson: Well, I think it’s a real issue. I think it is an issue for any community that feels itself disproportionately impacted by any aspect of environmental regulation. First and foremost at the EPA we are about protecting human health and the environment, but too often, whether it be the elderly or children or people in a community that find themselves subject to multiple sources of pollution, I think communities have felt let down in the past that EPA didn’t understand their particular needs.
Tavis: In this stimulus package which has just passed, I finally now had a chance to go through all the whatever, 1,000, 2,000 pages of it, and I was – I won’t say surprised – I was pleased to see that much of what President Obama talked about as a candidate around the environment, around energy, he put a lot of that in the stimulus package.
For those who have not had a chance to read this document – I’ve been on a book tour; I’ve had a lot of plane time – so for those who have not had a chance to read the document, specifically where your area of expertise is concerned – energy, environment – talk to me about what’s actually in the package that most of us don’t know about.
Jackson: Well, there was much made of the fact that the president – that this is actually the largest energy bill. If it had passed on its own, the amount of funding for renewable energy, for making our homes, our schools, our businesses, energy efficient, is actually the largest ever for our country, and that’s a very real – that’s not a symbol, that is substance.
That’s money going towards issues that are extraordinarily important for the future energy security of our country. And I think you hit it right on the head, Tavis, when you said that he has, this president in this bill and with Congress’ support, has managed to tie two very important things – the green economy, money, with the green environment.
There’s a lot of work to be done, and that work is an investment in things like in addition to energy we have money in for clean water, we have money in for safe drinking water and for wastewater treatments in our cities.
We have money for diesel emission reductions. As you know well, diesel emissions on a street corner in some cities make it more dangerous to be on that street corner than – about five times more dangerous than other places in the country. And we have money for brownfields cleanup and for superfund cleanups and underground storage cleanups.
And I think what that does, on top of everything else, besides the great environmental work, is reinforce the idea that those investments are actually jobs as well, and we’re investing in our health as well as our economy.
Tavis: I’m glad you made that last point because there have been a lot of folk for the last few years who’ve been making that point and pushing candidates, including Mr. Obama, to address these issues – this issue specifically of greening the ghetto first. Majora Carter talking about that, Van Jones talking about that, about how we get this administration to understand the need to green the ghetto first.
If you can green the ghetto first then you do two things simultaneously: you reduce poverty and you save the planet that we live on. Talk to me about your interests, your ideas, your thoughts specifically about those communities and greening, as somebody else would put it, the ghetto first.
Jackson: Well, any community – the heart of environmental is where you are. It’s where you live. And developing in people and understanding that we need to control the environment, in the very biggest sense of the word, around us. And so when I hear people like Van talk about the green-collar economy, they’re saying a few things.
They’re saying we need these jobs. These are jobs that when you talk about energy efficiency work, for example, or brown fields cleanup, they have to be done here in this country in the community, and they want to make sure that not only does this rising tide lift all boats, but that there’s a preference to make sure that that money gets directed in places where it can do real good environmentally as well.
And I’ll tell you that it’s not just about the ghetto, it’s not just about any one community. There are rural communities in this country where water quality is very bad, and some of this money will go to finally be able to address water quality so people don’t have to make a choice anywhere in this country between safe water and a bill that they can afford for their local water company.
So I think it’s never enough money, but I think it’s a strong statement about the importance of keeping those issues front and center for the American people.
Tavis: I assume that you’re going to take the EPA in a different direction than we got under eight years of the Bush administration. Tell me what concerns you most about what they were doing or not doing, as it were. You can talk about them now; they’re out of the building. (Laughter) So what were they doing or not doing, as it were, that has concerned you or that does concern you now that you are in charge of the EPA?
Jackson: Well, Tavis, I’m fond of saying change has definitely come to the EPA, and there’s a couple of messages here for our employees. The first is that we are back on the job. We want the American people to know that EPA is back and that we take very seriously our job to protect human health and the environment.
Now we also know we have to earn the trust of the American people again, and the ways we will do that will be by relying on a couple of key pillars. The first is science.
EPA has an extraordinarily educated work force – as many scientists in the government as you’ll find anywhere I think except for NASA. We have scientists who have a lot to say about issues, whether it’s clean air, whether it’s air toxics, whether it’s water pollution, whether it’s superfund cleanup, whether it’s toxic chemicals that enter our country or leave our country.
All the scientists need to be brought back to the front of this agency so that the people of our country know that there are scientists whose only job in government is to protect human health and the environment.
Then comes the law. I’m actually a scientist by training, but the law is extraordinarily important. When you talk about the last eight years, for me the largest tragedy is that we lost eight years fighting court battles that over and over again now we are seeing where we lose.
The government has lost eight years of time fighting for air standards that were not protective of human health, fighting to roll back protections for water that basically violate some of the tenets of the Clean Water Act.
So now the courts are starting to speak on that issue, and when you think about that lost time – I like to say it’s one thing to lose a court battle, but when the air is dirty we’re losing kids, we’re losing people on hot summer days to asthma attacks and lung problems.
So we have science, we have the law, we have to be transparent in what we do, and we must always keep an eye on those communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution, by the ravages of sort of the other side of our industrial society.
Tavis: You know these stats better than I do, but when you talk about these kids with asthma, one in three kids in Harlem has asthma – one in three young children in Harlem has asthma. I raise that only because I want to ask whether or not the damage is irreparable. Once you get a community that has contracted asthma or cancer, any number of other illnesses and life-threatening diseases because of their proximity to these environmental hazards, how do you get that life back? What do you do?
Jackson: Well, asthma’s a little bit different than cancer, obviously. Asthma – and I’m not a physician, but I have a son with asthma. My youngest son spent his first Christmas in the hospital with a severe asthma attack. Asthma is triggered. There are triggers for asthma. So our job here is to try to remove those triggers that are atmospheric – that are in the air on a hot summer day, especially in the city, because of the heat island effect.
Ozone and ground-level ozone, which is also called smog, and particulate matter from diesel engines trigger asthma attacks, and you can watch the temperature go up and the hospital admissions spike. And so that we can address easier than we can some of the toxic issues – toxics that may be triggering cancers in children and adults alike.
And so there I think we have certainly lost some amount of time, but it’s all about slowly but surely showing the American people progress in reducing toxic chemicals.
Tavis: So if you’ve got a court system that’s stacked against you, but that’s where these cases have to be heard, you’re arguing science which is, again, debatable on any number of fronts – I’m trying to figure out where and how you get traction to make the U-turn you want to make on the environment.
Jackson: Well, I think the traction is with the American people, Tavis. I really do believe that every major environmental law, if you see the history of environmental laws, came from people who said, “Okay, we’re tired of seeing our lakes and rivers on fire. We got a Clean Water Act.”
And we’re tired of the fact that we can’t answer the questions about why people in this country at this time in this day and age can’t count on clean air as one of the things that goes along with the territory, or clean water. And I think it’s very much the same with climate change, and very much the same with energy security and independence.
The American people are smart. They’re smart enough to have elected this president because they wanted a change; they wanted their government to work for them. And I think it’ll ultimately be the American people who demand accountability on protection of human health and the environment. After all, we work for them.
Tavis: I’m honored and delighted that you are there at the EPA, and I’m delighted you took time to talk to us tonight, Ms. Jackson.
Jackson: Thank you so much for the time. Thank you very much, Tavis.
Tavis: Glad to have you on.
