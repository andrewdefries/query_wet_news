Nearly four out of five Americans think it should be easier to fire weak teachers. But more than half think teachers are not paid enough. That’s according to a new poll by the Associated Press and Stanford University.The NewsHour’s special correspondent for education, John Merrow, profiles an Ohio school system with a unique way of reviewing teachers. JOHN MERROW: In most public schools, it’s extremely difficult to fire a bad teacher. Unions are often blamed for this. But, here in Toledo, things seem to be different. To protect the privacy of some individuals, we have concealed their names.MAN: The next person I will present is …JOHN MERROW: Mike Johnson and a handful of experienced educators have been mentoring rookie teachers for the past year, and now must present their recommendations to this panel. Should Toledo renew their contracts or let them go? MAN: She doesn’t engage with students when teaching the lesson. Uncooperative behavior was prevalent, and directions stated by the teacher often go unheard for followed.JOHN MERROW: The panel, comprised of five teachers and four administrators, will vote on Mike’s recommendation. WOMAN: Does she have support from the administration when she refers a student out of class? MAN: She does. We have discussed this before.JOHN MERROW: The process is part of a larger program called PAR, or peer assistance and review. It’ a system in which teachers have the power to evaluate each other. WOMAN: The recommendation is non-renewal of contract and no further employment with Toledo Public Schools. All those in favor of the recommendation, please raise your hand.JOHN MERROW: A first-year teacher has just lost her job. WOMAN: Thank you. JOHN MERROW: The process that leads up to this final vote begins in the fall. That’s when veteran teachers like Peg McAfee begin mentoring as many as a dozen first-year teachers. One of her assignments this year is William Hofland (ph), a science teacher. MAN: Does anyone know one of those characteristics? How about egg-laying? Most reptiles lay what kind of eggs? PEG MCAFEE, Toledo Public Schools: I make it clear from the beginning I’m a support system for him. I am his evaluator, but my job, especially for my career technology people, is to teach them how to be teachers. JOHN MERROW: She will work with Hofland and her other teachers once a week, and then present her recommendations to the panel in the spring. So, it’s not gotcha?PEG MCAFEE: No. It’s not a gotcha, walking in and caught you doing something bad. From my personality, it’s more I caught you doing something good, and we are building upon the good things that you’re doing, and then working on the things that I think you can strengthen. JOHN MERROW: Husband-and-wife team Dal and Francine Lawrence, who have been leading the local teachers union for almost half-a-century, are strong supporters of the program. Back in the 1970s, when Dal was union president, he felt the traditional system, in which principals evaluated teachers, was flawed. DAL LAWRENCE, former president, Toledo Federation of Teachers: The old system, the “top-down, I’m the boss and you’re not” kind of stuff, that produces natural byproducts like distrust, lack of responsibility, and lack of accountability. JOHN MERROW: He proposed peer assistance and review as an alternative. All first-year teachers would be coached, and those who were ineffective would be fired. The Toledo plan, a radical departure from the norm, was approved by the Toledo School Board in 1981. DAL LAWRENCE: I was just trying to look at medicine, how you become a doctor and how you become a teacher, and realizing that we were just so casual about the process. No wonder we were not respected. JOHN MERROW: The plan does seem to be working. On average, for nearly 30 years, about 8 percent of first-year teachers have been weeded out. Moreover, those who stay have had the benefit of a year of coaching. JOHN MERROW: Sarah Kirkbride-Hurley went through the mentorship program four years ago. SARAH KIRKBRIDE-HURLEY, Toledo Public Schools: It was nice to have my own person sort of to come in and answer my questions that spend time with me. JOHN MERROW: In most school systems, first-year teachers are simply left on their own, sink or swim, but not in Toledo. Do you now — if you’re in trouble, are you — would you ask another teacher for — how do I do this? SARAH KIRKBRIDE-HURLEY: Oh, yes. I believe is not reinventing the wheel. So, if somebody else did it really well, you should help me figure out how to do it really well, too. JOHN MERROW: Francine Lawrence thinks peer assistance and review helps, not only their teachers, but also the profession as a whole. FRANCINE LAWRENCE, president, Toledo Federation of Teachers: It’s teachers taking ownership for standards and enforcement, and feeling that sense of community, which is what a real profession is all about. And when teachers are excluded from that or excluded from real influence over curriculum and instruction and school policy, then it’s so easy to say, well, you know, it’s the principal’s problem. JOHN MERROW: PAR clearly benefits brand-new teachers, but the program is also supposed to retrain or remove ineffective veterans. Here at Bowsher High School, Peg McAfee and principal Larry Black are meeting to discuss a tenured teacher who has been reported to be ineffective. LARRY BLACK, principal, Bowsher High School: In the one class that I have observed, the students were kind of left on their own. They weren’t given any direction. There didn’t seem to be a lot of student engagement with — from the teacher’s side. JOHN MERROW: McAfee is going to be working with this veteran teacher for a year. He’s been placed in what’s called intervention. So, intervention is a kind of training or a rehab, or what… LARRY BLACK: Well, it’s — we like to think of it as a way to help people step back up their game. But, if they don’t, the other option is, yes, they will be looked at for termination. JOHN MERROW: Sounds good, but very few tenured teachers actually get looked at, and even fewer get fired. Toledo has about 2,000 teachers. Over the last six years, just 22 veterans have been placed in intervention, and only 15 have been fired. That’s not even three a year, just two-tenths of 1 percent. We got together with a group of parents, who gave us their thoughts on the Toledo plan. CHRISTINE VARWIG, parent: I love our teachers, but, at the same time, there’s a few that need to be reevaluated. And that’s where the school district, A., doesn’t have the means or the time, and the teachers’ plan doesn’t affect that. JOHN MERROW: Most said the plan wasn’t working, not when it came to dealing with bad teachers who have tenure. TERRY GLAZER, parent: All of us have had experiences where there has been a teacher identified in a school that even other teachers know need to be removed, but they continue to serve in the school system. JOHN MERROW: Others felt the Toledo plan has given teachers and the union too much power. MARCUS SMITH, parent: It seems like we have a system that’s built on self-policing. JOHN MERROW: And that doesn’t work? MARCUS SMITH: And, no, I don’t think that works. I don’t think that works in any system. DAL LAWRENCE: See, we now have intervention. JOHN MERROW: The Lawrences disagree. They maintain that most bad teachers are fired after their first year, and those who struggle later on are given help. FRANCINE LAWRENCE: Plus, we have robust professional development. We have peer coaches in classrooms throughout the district. So, there’s a lot of support to advance teachers’ practice. JOHN MERROW: These supports and mentoring the new teachers can be expensive, anywhere between a few hundred thousand dollars to over a million dollars a year, depending on how many new teachers have been hired. Although peer assistance and review has a 30-year track record here, fewer than 100 other school districts out of 14,000 nationwide have followed Toledo’s lead. Dal Lawrence believes that the two big national unions, the NEA and the AFT, would rather fight with management than collaborate. DAL LAWRENCE: There are people who don’t want this stuff to succeed. They’re afraid of the new workplace culture that’s evolving. They’re scared to death about it. JOHN MERROW: Why? DAL LAWRENCE: They’re afraid that the union won’t be strong if we’re working together with management. JOHN MERROW: Does the Toledo plan, which nurtures teachers, improve the academic performance of students? After all, that’s the bottom line. Here again, results are mixed. Toledo’s test scores are generally better than those in Ohio’s seven other large cities, but they lag behind the rest of the state in all subjects and all grades.

Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.In its ruling in favor of President Obama’s health care law, the Supreme Court handed Republicans a political weapon by calling the individual mandate a tax.But likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney appears set to disarm his party’s attacks by siding with the president in terms of how the mandate is interpreted.In an exchange with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Monday, top Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom punctured the tax balloon. Here’s the exchange:TODD: It sounds like Gov. Romney though agrees that it’s not a tax. So what you just said is that Gov. Romney agrees that it’s not a tax. You guys called it a tax?FEHRNSTROM: The governor disagreed with the ruling of the court. He agreed with the dissent written by Justice [Antonin] Scalia, which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax.TODD: Okay…I think we’re talking around each other. The governor does not believe the mandate is a tax? That is what you’re saying?FEHRNSTROM: The governor believes that what we put in place in Massachusetts was a penalty and he disagrees with the court’s ruling that the mandate was a tax.TODD: But he agrees with the president that it is not, and he believes that you should not call the tax penalty a tax, you should call it a penalty or a fee or a fine?FEHRNSTROM: That’s correct. After the remarks dominated cable news chatter and Twitter (with political junkies digging up Fehrnstrom’s awkward “Etch-a-sketch” quote from the primary campaign), the Romney campaign issued a statement attempting to clarify things.“The Supreme Court left President Obama with two choices: the federal individual mandate in Obamacare is either a constitutional tax or an unconstitutional penalty,” said spokeswoman Andrea Saul. Governor Romney thinks it is an unconstitutional penalty. What is President Obama’s position: is his federal mandate unconstitutional or is it a tax?”Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was asked Sunday during an appearance on Fox News whether if the national mandate is a tax means that the requirement in Massachusetts is also a tax.“I think Gov. Romney will have to speak for himself about what was done in Massachusetts,” McConnell said.And therein lies the dilemma for Republicans. While many in the party immediately pounced on the health care ruling to slam the president for raising taxes, the person they’ve chosen to make the case against the Obama presidency has not followed suit given his own history on the issue.McConnell told a group in Kentucky on Monday that it is hard to undo the law, reports Daniel Straus of The Hill.“If you like the bill — and some of you may — it is hard to undo something of this magnitude. It was a 2,700 page bill, which nobody really understands anyway,” McConnell said.A note to our readers: The Morning Line will take Wednesday off to celebrate America’s birthday. Be safe, everyone, and we’ll be back Thursday.A CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERJeffrey Brown drilled down into the court’s health care ruling with two top constitutional scholars, Larry Tribe, a law professor who taught Chief Justice John Roberts, and David Rivkin, who represented the states that challenged the health care law.They sparred over what the decision signifies about the court’s ideological divide and the legal heart of the matter.“I have been saying from the very beginning this is not about health care. This is not about individual mandate. It’s about constitutional architecture,” Rivkin said.Tribe said the Obama administration took the position that it’s important to recognize the difference between the police powers of the states and the limited powers of the federal government, “but it simply argued that this law was within those powers, and it turns out that it was.”“You know, we don’t have a rule in the Constitution of just one clause per case,” he added. “Something can be valid because of several possible sources of power.”Watch the full segment here or below.496103255032550Chief Justice Roberts' Key Role in Health Care RulingJeffrey Brown talks to Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School who had Chief Justice John Roberts and President Obama as students, and David Rivkin, who represented the states that challenged the health care law, about what the Supreme Court's landmark health care ruling means and its broader impacts.2012-07-02 18:31:00disabled22525068160bmEK29uh9ktrueJosh Gerstein looks at liberal fears about Romney in Tuesday’s Politico.

Tune in to see Judy Woodruff chat with Marcia Coycle of the National Law Journal and presidential historian Michael Beschloss.FRESH POLLINGA lot has happened in the past month, including the release of a new jobs report, the president’s decision to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation and a flurry of activity at the Supreme Court. But the latest snapshot of the presidential campaign released Monday by CNN found the race unchanged from a month ago, with the president leading Romney, 49 percent to 46 percent. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent.The poll gave Romney a 51 percent to 43 percent advantage in 15 battleground states, a list that included Republican-leaning states Arizona, Indiana and Missouri.Other recent surveys of battleground states have put the president ahead of Romney. Last week’s NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll gave Mr. Obama a 50 percent to 42 percent lead in the dozen states surveyed: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold the Affordable Care Act, 51 percent of respondents in the CNN survey said the president would better handle the issue of health care compared to 44 percent who picked Romney.Reporter-producer Cassie M. Chew writes that 56 percent of Americans said they would like to see the health care law’s detractors stop efforts to block its implementation and move on to other national problems, according to a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll assessing the public’s reaction to the court’s ruling.The survey found that Democrats overwhelmingly said opponents should move on to other issues (82 percent), as do 51 percent of independents and 26 percent of Republicans. But seven in 10 Republicans (69 percent) said they want to see efforts to stop the law continue, a view shared by 41 percent of independents and 14 percent of Democrats.The poll found 47 percent approved of the court’s decision and 43 percent disapproved. Independents were evenly divided, 44 percent in favor and 43 percent opposed.Solid majorities of voters of every political stripe said the decision won’t impact whether or not they vote this November, though Republicans were more likely than Democrats (31 percent compared to 18 percent) to say the result makes them more likely to turn out.The survey was conducted Thursday to Saturday via a random digit dial landline and cell phone sample of 1,239 adults in both English and Spanish. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.2012 LINE ITEMSThe Obama campaign is out with a new ad keeping up the Romney-is-an-outsourcer drumbeat.

"I cannot understand it when people say it doesn't matter. I think that's a pure cop-out. They don't want to deal with this tricky question. They don't want, perhaps, to be disloyal to a myth."
Michael Rubbo, filmmaker
"Partly it's to do with honoring truth, honoring fact. And, you know, without being melodramatic about it, you deny the reality of Shakespeare one moment, you can deny the reality of the Holocaust the next."
Jonathan Bate, Univ. of Liverpool
"When you talk to people who are absolutely committed — they cannot conceive that you would have a doubt about it — now, that's a belief system. And what I've been trying to do is back up to the factual, to the evidence."
Diana Price, independent scholar
"You might say I'm shirking my obligation by not taking a position. But my position is that the phenomenon is fascinating, and that it tells us a great deal about `Shakespeare,' in quotation marks, and the way in which Shakespeare has shaped modern life."
Marjorie Garber, Harvard Univ.
Anti-Stratfordians, those who don't believe the man from Stratford wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare, often refer to the Shakespeare industry -- that is, both the academic industry of traditional Shakespeare studies and the tourist industry surrounding Stratford-upon-Avon. Their point, a valid one, is that there are vested interests, both professional and commercial, at stake in the authorship debate, and that these interests are threatened by "unorthodox" theories of who wrote the works. Yet it's clear that the Authorship Question has spawned something of a cottage industry itself, with its own organizations, publications, websites, and, indeed, vested interests. In fact, the industry may be outgrowing the cottage, with rumors of Hollywood films in the pipeline and with mainstream media getting into the act.
But isn't it possible that far more is at stake in the authorship debate than individual careers and fortunes? Isn't there something about the authorship question that gets to the heart of how we understand Shakespeare, the works themselves, and even our own relationship to history, literature, and creativity? Does the authorship question, in other words, reveal as much about us -- whether we're Stratfordian, anti-Stratfordian, or agnostic -- as it does about the provenance of Hamlet, As You Like It, and MacBeth?
With these questions in mind, and with a strong sense that the authorship controversy is a cultural phenomenon worth pondering (and by no means easily dismissed), we invited Michael Rubbo and three other experts on the subject -- Jonathan Bate (who appears in "Much Ado About Something"), Diana Price, and Marjorie Garber -- to weigh in on what we should make of this puzzling, and at times heated, debate. In Web-exclusive interviews with each of them we tried to get at the questions: Why does it matter who wrote the works of Shakespeare? Is the authorship controversy a distraction from the plays and poems? What, exactly, is at stake here?
The following are excerpts from our conversations, with links to the full interviews. If you, Dear Reader, feel strongly about the matter, we invite you to register your opinion in a special online poll, and then to join the discussion.
Wen Stephenson
FRONTLINE
Jan. 2, 2003
A filmmaker, painter, and former executive producer of documentaries for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Rubbo produced, wrote, and directed "Much Ado About Something," which explores the case for Christopher Marlowe as the author of Shakespeare.
Where do you place yourself on the authorship question?
Well, I feel in my gut that Shakespeare was not the author. I don't think the proof against him is conclusive, but he just doesn't feel and smell like the author to me. He's not satisfying. There does seem to be a need to have somebody who's intellectually and emotionally satisfying. And the more I find out about him, the more he fails to come to the party. He just doesn't perform as one expects a great author should. This man who often writes about our theatricality, about how we strut and fret on the stage of life -- he has no strut, no fret himself. He seems to stand in the wings of life as a gray ghost. Of course, the record gets lost, and he may have done things that haven't come down to us. Yet one feels that something would have pushed its way through if he really was the fantastic intellect that he must have been to have written those plays. ... I mean it's fascinating. ... Shakespeare is deeply unsatisfying and deeply implausible. Marlowe is not the perfect replacement, but he fits quite well -- as long as he's not dead in 1593.
Whether it was Marlowe, whether it was Oxford -- whoever it might have been -- how do you answer the question of why it matters?
I find that question very strange. I mean, I don't know why anybody would ask that. Of course it matters. It's self-evident that it matters?
Yes, because in the sense that we ourselves have any creativity at all, we must be interested in the creative process. ...
So I cannot understand it when people say it doesn't matter. I think that's a pure cop-out. They don't want to deal with this tricky question. They don't want, perhaps, to be disloyal to a myth. Their attitude is, "A bard in the hand is worth two in the bush, and thanks very much."
How do you respond when they say that all this controversy over the authorship is a distraction from the plays and the poems?
Not at all. It feeds back into an understanding of the plays and the works. ... You look at them with fresh interest, you read them through a different eye, and you tease out new meaning. It may be meaning that is relevant to your cause or to your belief, but I don't think it stops there. I think, in fact, you tease out all sorts of meaning and are taken on a real roller-coaster ride, which may end up almost anywhere. Certainly not somewhere safe. ...
Some people would say the authorship controversy represents our obsession with conspiracy theories, or our suspicion of cultural authority -- you know, we want to bring down Shakespeare and the academic establishment. Or maybe it's our obsession with celebrity, and that's why we're more interested in the biography, the life, than we are in the plays.
All those explanations end up as excuses for not taking the authorship question seriously. I mean, whenever the Stratfordians get going, they tend to not review the arguments that are made against Shakespeare but to question the motives of the attackers. For instance, they claim that the de Vere people believe in the Earl of Oxford not because he's a likely choice, but because they're American snobs and they can't tolerate the idea that these plays could have been written by a lowly commoner like Shakespeare. The Marlovians are similarly dismissed not as people with an interesting argument, but as conspiracy theorists, people generally obsessed by conspiracies. So it's always "shoot the messenger." What you're saying with your questions is a subtle variant on that, you know, that we have to explain this obsession. That it's just a phenomenon. That it suits some people's basic needs because of the cultural traditions of today, or where we find ourselves in terms of history.
But I admit that, finding a good history mystery is immensely satisfying in its own right. And as Peter Farey says, it probably doesn't really matter how it ever turns out, because it's great fun. I agree to that. But I do think there's real substance to this, and the Stratfordians rarely address the substance. In fact, they continually distort the case or trivialize it. ...
But you see, the Stratfordians are in a very awkward position, because whereas the doubters like myself can enjoy this controversy, amass our arguments, and give it our best shot, the Stratfordians must defend this man, like him or not. They're given him as a construct, and they cannot give an inch. ...
A scholar named Tucker Brooke reportedly said, "Even if Shakespeare stood up in his grave and said he was not the author, we wouldn't believe him." And that's a very telling line. We couldn't afford to believe him, one might add. It's not the financial aspect of it; it's the intellectual investment, it's the professional investment. ...

Diana Price, in this excerpt from Shakespeare's Unorthodox Biography: New Evidence of an Authorship Problem (2001), challenges the traditional scholarship supporting the man from Stratford as the author of the plays and poems.
· Scenes from the Birth of a Myth and the Death of a Dramatist
Jonathan Bate, in this essay reprinted from Shakespeare's Face (2002), argues the case for the man from Stratford and offers an explanation for why the authorship question has proven so irresistible for nearly two hundred years.
What the Stratfordians ought to do is just sit down and say, "Yeah, let's consider this, and we'll give the other side their due and their word -- they're not idiots -- and we'll see." If they were to do that, they may be able to close off the whole thing. But of course I think they simply feel they can't, and that these doubts are unanswerable. If they were answerable, then they would stop shooting the messenger and just get on with the business of answering them, wouldn't they? ...
An eloquent and passionate defender of the Stratford case, Bate is a professor of English at the University of Liverpool, the author of The Genius of Shakespeare (1997), The Oxford Illustrated History of Shakespeare on Stage (2001), and Shakespeare and Ovid (1993), and general editor of the new Oxford history of English literature.
What do you make of the Shakespeare authorship controversy as a phenomenon itself?
I am very interested in this as a cultural and historical phenomenon. And for me, it tells us a lot about the kind of cult status of Shakespeare. All religions have many different sects, and they usually have heresies and various extremities within them. And since the 18th century there has been a quasi-religious cult of Shakespeare, and also in modern times there's a way in which literature and the cultural icons of the past have almost become a substitute religion. So I think it's bound to be the case that where Shakespeare is like a religion, where there is a cult, there is bound to be some kind of heresy spinning off from that. So for me, the really interesting aspect of it is to ask the question: when did people start asking these questions about whether the man from Stratford wrote the plays? ... It wasn't a question that occurred to anybody in Shakespeare's own lifetime, or for nearly two hundred years after his death. What we find is that it begins to be a question in the 19th century, which is at the time that Shakespeare has become a cult figure, he's become widely regarded as the greatest author that has ever been, he's become a kind of god. It seems to me that's the key point to grasp about this whole issue -- that it's an off-shoot, or what a philosopher would call an epiphenomenon, of the cult of Shakespeare. ...
What do you think of pursuing the authorship question as a legitimate literary-historical inquiry?
Well, it's not a legitimate inquiry at all, because it's entirely dependent on evidence that isn't there, it's entirely dependent on a conspiracy theory. ... The whole debate really stems from a profound ignorance about the nature of the literary and dramatic culture of the time. I mean, anybody doing serious research in the period will very quickly see a huge pile of evidence that Shakespeare was very, very deeply involved with the life of the theater. Whereas the various aristocratic candidates that have been put forward -- Lord Bacon was the first one and the Earl of Oxford is currently the most popular one -- they came from a completely different world and had a completely different kind of preoccupation when they were writing. Because Marlowe was a professional man of the theater, it's in that sense that Marlowe is the one sort of theoretically plausible candidate, at a kind of stylistic level. But the evidence that he was actually killed in that brawl is incontrovertible. ...
Where do you see the postmodernists in the authorship debate?
The postmodern idea that, in a sense, the author has no control over the text, that the text sort of floats free, and the meaning of the text is its consumption rather than its production ... all that goes back to this kind of Parisian 1960s idea of the "death of the author." But of course the effect of that among postmodernist scholars is that they cease to be interested in the author as an individual agent ... as an individual persona. And this means that a lot of academic criticism has vacated the whole area of biography, individual genius, and so on. And it seems to me it's left this gap, which has allowed the amateur sleuths, the eccentrics, the obsessives, to seize the ground, in terms of public perception. And so it is that very, very few academics that I know are remotely interested in the "Shakespeare authorship question." Whereas everybody I ever meet, like a taxi driver, who asks me what I do, and I say I'm a Shakespeare scholar, sooner or later they say, "Well, did he write the plays, then?"
I mean, I don't want to get on a high horse about this, but I think there is an abnegation of scholarly responsibility on the part of many of my colleagues in the profession, because, you know, history does exist, and the fact is that the man from Stratford was a flesh and blood man who did write the plays. ... So how do you answer the question, Why does it matter?
Partly it's to do with honoring truth, honoring fact, which it seems to me we have a historical duty to do. And, you know, without being melodramatic about it, you deny the reality of Shakespeare one moment, you can deny the reality of the Holocaust the next. I mean, that's the melodramatic answer. A conspiracy theory about the "Shakespeare industry," a conspiracy theory about the "Holocaust industry." It's the responsibility of scholarship to examine evidence -- and, okay, fact is always interpreted, the way we select fact is always value-laden, but history did happen, facts do exist, and we forget that at our peril. So that's a kind of moral argument. And then I also think, at another level, it matters because the truth about Shakespeare, which is that he was someone from the provinces, from a sort of lower-middle-class background, with no university education -- though a decent grammar school education -- who still managed to achieve an extraordinary amount, that does seem to me, in its quiet way, to be a heroic story, a story that is worth admiring. It's like a story of an ordinary person making it into the White House. And the problem -- less with the Marlowe theory, but with the other ones, particularly the Earl of Oxford and the various other aristocratic theories that have really had a lot of currency, and really have more currency than the Marlowe theory -- is that they are so condescending and snobbish. The suggestion that you have to be a mighty aristocrat in order to write mighty works, I find that politically very offensive. So, you know, without meaning to be pompous, I have got a moral and a political argument there. ...
Do you find the authorship controversy to be a distraction from the plays and poems?
Yeah, I do think that. And having said that it matters, I then would want to go on and say that what really matters is the text of Hamlet. And as I've suggested in the book, and in our discussion, there is a way in which I want to say Shakespeare is not the sole author of Hamlet. Going back to that idea of multiple agency and collaborative authorship, I'm convinced that his very close friend Richard Burbage, who was the first Hamlet on stage, contributed a very, very great deal to what Hamlet was. And there's another sense in which Shakespeare was only the partial author of Hamlet, in that he was rewriting an old play, unfortunately now lost, on the same theme. And we don't actually know for a fact which bits were Shakespeare's and which were in the old play. Whereas in King Lear we do, because we have the old play. And so what we see when we begin to look at the complexity of the text, and its production, and its history, its revisions, we precisely see that the individual author -- the guy from Stratford, the guy with the balding head -- is the most important agent, but he's by no means the only agent. And indeed I would then want to go on to say that what makes the text important is its extraordinary capacity to go on speaking in new ways to new generations, in ways that Shakespeare, the man, would never have dreamed of. ... In the end, what we mean by the "genius of Shakespeare" is the "Shakespeare effect." It's not the guy who lived from 1564 to 1616, but the extraordinary effect that the works have had on millions and millions of readers and playgoers and other creative artists down the ages. But of course, in a way, that's quite a complicated idea. And I think part of the problem with this division between academic approaches and popular, is that that more complicated idea is quite difficult to put across in a world of soundbites.
A self-described anti-Stratfordian, Price is the author of Shakespeare's Unorthodox Biography: New Evidence of an Authorship Problem (2001). Her work on the authorship question has appeared in The Review of English Studies and The Elizabethan Review. There's clearly a division between the academic establishment, the academic world, and most of those who have written on and are interested in the authorship question. What do you think of that?
Well, it's sort of a vicious circle, because the academic community does not accept the authorship as a legitimate question. But what I'm trying to do is play by their rules and earn their respect and make it very difficult for them to just flick it aside. ... If I have one thing that I think is paramount, it's to do that, and to try to earn the respect of the orthodox, because people like me are usually viewed as crackpots. ... I mean, that's just how it is. ...
It's very unusual, I think, for someone to get this far into the authorship issue and not privilege one candidate over another. ... Oxfordians keep trying to claim me as their own, and, you know, I've been invited to all their conferences, and I don't go. ... But it puts me in a really awkward position, because most of those who are just passionate about the case for Oxford -- or whoever it is -- think I'm sort of wimping out. ...
Why do you think these people become so passionate about it? I mean, there seems to be something at stake here. What do you think is at stake?
I've looked into some of the psychology of belief systems, and I think it has a lot to do with that. It's not that hard to understand why there might be a question for the authorship, but it takes an awful lot to go beyond that into, well, what really did happen and what might Shakespeare's role actually have been, and who are the possible candidates. People want to gravitate to an answer. And I have to say that the first time I read through the case for Oxford, I could feel the tug of wanting to embrace it and buy into it. And even though I called myself a provisional Oxfordian for those couple years ... when I was doing recreational reading -- before I really started to do this seriously -- even at the point where I said, "I have to back off this theory," I could feel the tug of wanting to emotionally commit to it. And, you know, people fall in love with Oxford. They go way off the deep end. ... And when you start to talk to people who are absolutely committed -- they cannot conceive that you would have a doubt about it -- now, that's a belief system. And what I've been trying to do is back up to the factual, to the evidence. And I also frame my question very differently than do Oxfordians. Oxfordians say, "Well, was it Shakespeare or was it Oxford?" And I say, "Was it Shakespeare or was it not Shakespeare?" And that, to me, is the first question that needs to be answered before you can begin to look at the candidates and test them -- Oxford and Marlowe being two to be tested. ...
But I notice that you do think there's some credibility to the idea that it was a courtier, that it was a well-born gentleman, someone with a certain social rank. Right.
And that's something that the Oxfordians are often taken to task for, is a kind of--
Snobbishness.
Yes, a kind of snobbishness or an assumption that it couldn't have been a commoner. What do you think about that aspect?
That comes up regularly -- I got it in the classroom just last week -- and I do address it in the book. But my reaction to that is, simply, it's a misplaced appeal to egalitarian sensibility. I would never say, and I do not say, that Shakespeare of Stratford could not possibly have overcome the disadvantages of his provincial upbringing or the questions about his schooling. I'm not saying he couldn't have done it. I am saying that if he did it, we'd have some evidence to show how he did it. And since we don't have the evidence -- and because he is unique in the absence of that kind of evidence -- that's why I have a doubt as to his authorship.
So I just come back to "show me the evidence." If he did it, he's going to have left us a little bit -- he's going to give us some clue in the historical documentation as to how he did it. ... And if you cannot use the documentary evidence to account for his familiarity with -- and then go into the laundry list of all of the things with which this author was conversant, languages and interests and pastimes that were the exclusive province of the aristocracy -- if you can't account for them with the documentary evidence, then there's a question. ...
Why does it matter who wrote Shakespeare? As you know, a lot of people, especially in the academy, have been trained to say that who the author of a work is doesn't really matter and that questions of biography and authorship are just a distraction. "We've got the plays. They're great. So who cares?"
Yes. And isn't all of this a distraction?
There are a lot of reasons why it matters. Part of it is giving credit where credit's due. ... I agree with those who think that the plays of Shakespeare are the greatest literature written in the English language, and I would love to know who wrote them. I am profoundly unsatisfied with the traditional biography. I think it answers no questions at all, and I would like to know what happened. ...
But if literary biography didn't matter, we wouldn't have all these literary biographies coming off the press. And whether it's Virginia Woolf or whether it's Oscar Wilde or Mark Twain or William Shakespeare, people want to know about the writers who are their favorites. And I can't think of any author except William Shakespeare who routinely commands his own section in a bookstore, so a lot of people are evidently interested in reading who this guy was. And these hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands and thousands, of biographies of Shakespeare have been written by the very professors who are in the same field as those who are saying biography doesn't matter. Well, it obviously matters to all those professors.
And I'll give you two more reasons as to why this matters to even a lay person. Those biographies of Shakespeare are footnoted in other journal articles on Elizabethan and Jacobean subjects, so it's incorporated into the scholarship. So that's an important reason to be sure that it's right. ...
And then, finally, the fun part, if we had an author whose life made sense with the plays, we'd find new stuff in the plays. ... We probably would find a lot of topical references that we've all been missing. You know how you tilt the prism and all of a sudden you see a new spectrum? ... And I just think we'd find all kinds of new dimensions in the plays if we had an author who fit. Right now I think they're great plays, but it's all abstraction. You don't have a life with any resonances in the plays. At least, I do not consider the reference to sheepskin in the fifth act of Hamlet to be a resonance. ...
The beauty of the plays is that they're so universal, and they speak to so many different issues, and you can always reinterpret the plays. And sometimes the biography can actually shed light on intention or meaning. And that, to me, is a very valuable thing, and it also can be very exciting if you know that this situation motivated this artistic choice.
Professor of English and director of the Humanities Center at Harvard University, Garber is the author of three books on Shakespeare, including Shakespeare's Ghost Writers (1987), and several collections of cultural essays, including Symptoms of Culture (1998) and, most recently, Quotation Marks. You seem to be more of an observer than a participant in the authorship debate. Is that right? I think that's fair to say. I think the observer has the most fun here, and that it is a fascinating cultural phenomenon. It's perfectly understandable that people would take an author who is so central to our cultural understanding of what human nature is supposedly like, of what contemporary life is supposedly like -- a figure who seems to be above the notion of authorship, as people like Emerson have said -- and try to bring him down to size, usually their own size, whatever size that might be. So it's a phenomenon worth watching across the centuries, and it's a phenomenon worth watching in the 21st century.
Do you believe that the man from Stratford wrote the plays?
Why don't you ask me whether I care? Because I think that that may be more relevant here. I'm very interested in the plays. I have given a great deal of my life, and very pleasurably and enthusiastically, to teaching these plays, to reading them, to watching them on the stage, to reading what other scholars have to say about them, and so forth. I think that they are inexhaustible, that these are extraordinary documents; that every time I read the plays, or one of these plays, every time I see a production -- whether it's an undergraduate production or professional production -- I learn something I didn't know about these texts and about how they function in performance. ... So I'm deeply committed to these texts and to a study of these texts, and to the pleasure that they give. ...
Do you feel duty-bound to maintain a critical detachment? Oh, no. I mean, my position is one of critical disposition rather than of obligation. You might say that I was obligated to come down on one side or the other. ... I am expected to have -- because I teach Shakespeare, I've written about Shakespeare -- I'm expected to have an opinion about it. And in fact, since my opinion is a kind of meta-opinion, or a para-opinion, it doesn't satisfy everyone. So you might say I'm shirking my obligation by not taking a position. But my position is that the phenomenon is fascinating, and that it is telling, and that it tells us a great deal about "Shakespeare," in quotation marks, about the cultural transmission of the notion of Shakespeare, and the way in which Shakespeare has shaped modern life. I mean, what interests me about it is how passionate people are about this and to what great lengths they will go to construct theories of conspiracy, of paranoia, of displacement, of masquerade -- all, incidentally, themes that happen within the Shakespeare plays. That they create narratives in which they believe quite passionately, and have gone to very great lengths in terms of excavations and explorations, in order to try to find the true Shakespeare -- as if, somehow, like finding the True Cross, finding some shred of clothing or handwriting would bring us any closer to an understanding of the phenomenon of the writing of the plays or of their cultural power.
What is at stake here? Well, I think a great deal is at stake, in a funny way. A whole way of reading, or understanding the relationship of literature to life, is, in a way, at stake. ...
I think it would be interesting to discover, as it's easier to do with authors who have written more recently, what the relation of the fictions in an author's work is to his or her own biographical circumstances, or education, or reading, or politics. But I don't go to literature for the message, for the historical event that is now allegorized in MacBeth or King Lear or whatever. For me, the power of these works lies in their delineation of character, the extraordinary language, the way in which there seems to be a conversation from play to play, and so forth. And so for me, the totality here is the collection of the plays, rather than any imagined or verifiable human being whose personal data might play into our understanding of this. ...
So what you're saying, then, is that what's at stake is our very relationship to the art itself? Yeah. What's at stake in the controversy are, among other things, a lot of vested interests -- I mean, the tourism interest, tourism in Stratford would disappear if the author were Oxford -- but what's at stake more seriously, maybe, for somebody interested in literary study, is why we study literature. What is the power of the work of art? What's the relationship of plays and playing to life? ...
In Shakespeare's Ghost Writers, you say that "a great deal seems invested in not finding the answer" as to who wrote the plays.
I still believe that.
Can you explain what you mean by that?
Well, Shakespeare seems to be a figure who transcends the possibility of authorship -- again, that's something that Emerson says. It's not an original thought with me. But to have Shakespeare turn out to be an ordinary person with a stomach ache or a bad marriage or budget problems, or something like that, would be to bring him down to human scale. And there's almost a kind of secular religion of Shakespeare that wants to quote these texts as if they were a kind of Bible of human nature, and that wants to understand Shakespeare as -- you know, the famous portrait of Shakespeare with the high forehead, as if he were a mind, as if he were an intelligence, looking into our pettier lives and understanding them beyond some way that we could.
If Shakespeare's brought down to size, in a way, to scale, and is made to be subject to the ordinary pressures of his time, or of any time, then we lose that sense of the all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful Shakespeare, about which, again, poets have written from Matthew Arnold's sonnet on: that desire to imagine that Shakespeare knows us better than we know ourselves. And that kind of numinousness, and that kind of transcendence, is not commensurate with any too-intimate knowledge. So in order to keep the ideal of Shakespeare as the playwright beyond play writing -- the author beyond authorship, the poet who knows us all -- we need, in a way, not to know him. The best way to know him is, in a way, not to know him.
