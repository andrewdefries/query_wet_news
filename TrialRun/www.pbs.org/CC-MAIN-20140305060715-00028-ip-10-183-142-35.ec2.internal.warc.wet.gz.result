Where the Journal News Went Wrong in Mapping Gun Owners
by Kathleen Bartzen Culver
Technology activists often invoke the maxim, “information wants to be free.” In one way, the line is intended to undercut the monetary value of information, be it news stories, Hollywood films or Top 40 hits. But the adage can mean more than money. It’s used to justify breaking barriers that limit access to information and [...] more »

by Lauren Orsini
During his 2013 State of the Union speech, President Obama touched on an issue very close to American hearts when he brought up gun control. “[Gun control] proposals deserve a vote,” the president said to resounding applause. “Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen [...] more »

Subjects: social history
Thinking skills: chronological thinking, historical analysis and
interpretation, historical research
Time period: 1853-1929
The Orphan Trains follows the story of the New York Children's Aid
Society, created in 1853 to provide thousands of street children with homes in
rural communities in the American midwest. This forerunner of modern foster
care forever changed the lives of poor urban children--sometimes providing them
with great opportunity, sometimes bringing heartbreak and disappointment.
Before Watching
1. Ask students how children are generally viewed in our culture. How has this
view changed over time?
2. As students watch the program, ask them to write down Charles Loring Brace's
reasons for developing the Children's Aid Society. Have them also note the
strengths and weaknesses of his organization.
After Watching
1. Discuss whether or not the Children's Aid Society child placement program
would be appropriate today. What must people consider when designing a foster
care program? Brainstorm a list of goals for such programs.
2. Ask students if the first-hand accounts in the program affected how they
viewed the whole story. Who didn't they hear from directly? If they had heard
from these other people, how do they think it might have affected their view?
3. Have students research the history of foster care in the United States. Ask
them to consider how changes in this system have reflected changes in society's
view of children. After students finish their research, have them work in small
groups to outline a successful foster care program, then present their ideas to
the class.
4. Ask students to imagine life as a homeless child in the 1800s living on New
York City's streets, taking an orphan train, then living with a family in rural
America. Have them write a story or poem about the experience.

Women’s SederTo celebrate Passover, Jews gather for a Seder, a special dinner where they retell the story of their ancestors' exodus from Egypt. The Seder ritual is guided by a special book called the Haggadah. In recent years, some Jewish groups have developed Seders with a special focus. Ma'yan, the Women's Project at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan, celebrated the anniversary of its feminist Seder.April 11, 2003 | Comments
