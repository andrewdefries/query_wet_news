Local News Needs ‘Bottom Up’ Structure to Survive
Tweet
By Martin Moore
September 27, 2010
This week Orkney Today announced it was closing. The paper, which served the small islands of Orkney just off the Scottish coast, was — like countless other local papers — battling against declining circulation and disappearing ad revenues. “Orkney Media Group management and the newspaper’s excellent staff have tried a number of initiatives to reverse the fortunes of the newspaper,” the paper reported, “but to no avail.”
If the news industry as a whole isn’t exactly the picture of good health, local news is in the emergency room. News problems at a national level — falls in circulation, and collapse in classified and advertising revenues — are acute at a local level.
This has serious political implications, particularly in terms of who acts as the democratic watchdog, which is why this concerns not only news bosses but also politicians.
“We are concerned that … the problems in the local media industry are leading to a scrutiny gap,” read a report, Future for Local and Regional News, from the Parliamentary Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport.
Defining Local
The problem is, when thinking about what to do about it, how do you define local? For Orkney Today this was pretty easy. It served a clearly defined geographic area — the Orkney isles — that is run by the Orkney local council, and that has a long established sense of community. But what about places that aren’t surrounded by sea, that don’t have a single local authority, and may not have such a long established sense of community?
This isn’t an academic question. In political — i.e. public policy — terms how you define local will determine what you do and how you do it. How can a government, for example, even consider direct or indirect subsidies, for example, without knowing who to give them to and what parameters to set?
Boil it down and you can probably define “local” in three different ways: Politically, economically, or socially. (I’m deliberately ignoring random geographic boundaries even though that’s how regional broadcast news appears to be defined right now). The way you choose to define local then has fundamental implications for the type of journalism you end up with.
If you’re in government you’re probably most worried about the health of democracy and so it makes logical sense to define “local” in political terms — i.e. at the ward level, or the local authority or county council boundary, or the constituency. This way you highlight the watchdog role of journalism. You make clear that, as a society, you believe in the idea of a “Fourth Estate” — a section of society whose role it is to scrutinize local politics, uncover corruption, and tell truth to power.
The problem with this is that political boundaries don’t necessarily make economic sense or correspond to what people think of as local. Take my ward in England, called “Kingham, Rollright and Enstone.” I don’t live in Kingham, Rollright or Enstone, I live just outside Chipping Norton. So a news service called The Kingham, Rollright and Enstone Times wouldn’t seem very relevant to me. On top of which my ward is pretty spread out (it’s rural) and there are only about 4,000 people in it in total. That’s too few for most professional news organizations to bother with, unless they can get costs close to nil.
Because if you’re a news organization then while you’re thinking about local politics you’re also thinking economics. You have to be if you’re going to survive. You have to think about how many eyeballs you need to make enough revenue via circulation, subscriptions, classifieds, etc. You’re making a calculation that, say, you need to sell 10,000 print copies a week to get by. With 10 percent penetration that means you need to serve an area of about 100,000 people. Multiply the numbers considerably for bigger publications or for broadcast. But the problem with an economic definition of local is that it’s unlikely to match the public’s perception.
If you’re a member of the public then local probably means your street, your neighborhood, your town. What the news industry likes to call hyper-local. As a participant in a recent Birmingham focus group said, “If it’s not within a 10 mile radius, it’s not local news as far as I’m concerned … it might as well be national.” That quote comes from “Meeting the News Needs of Local Communities,” a research report released this month by Media Trust. News at this level is great for building community cohesion and for making people feel a part of a bigger society, but it’s hard to imagine anyone but volunteers and non-profits providing it in a sustainable way.
Recipe for Success
That’s why it’s so hard for a government, or a news organization, to know what to do. You can’t create this sort of genuine hyper-local news service from the top down. Neither the government nor a news organization can direct the public to produce news about where they live. This sort of news has to be from the ground up. It has to be participatory. It has to be by and for the local community.
Which is why the local news organizations/co-operatives/forums most likely to work are those that start from the bottom, and that build participation, collaboration, mutualization, and partnerships into their DNA. This is very hard indeed for legacy news organizations to do. And it means that the best a government can do is to create a framework in which people are able to fill the vacuum being left by the disappearance of local news, rather than trying to subsidize the existing industry or provide top-down direct support.

Depression	Eating disorders are psychologically based conditions in which food and weight obsessions become the central focus of one’s life.
Eating disorders go beyond the drive to be thin. There are many factors that play into the development of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Central to eating disorders is often a harsh, distorted, highly critical attitude about body image and weight. Eating disorders impact anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, social or economic background, or education. All Eating Disorders BiographiesSee more:Blog Posts (26)Bios (7)

Laura McEnaney on: Fear of Fallout Fallout
Q:	Is there a shift in civil defense policy after the 1954 hydrogen bomb
test code-named Bravo? LM:	It has a dramatic impact in terms of people realizing that there is no
place to hide, that evacuation isn't going to work because the radioactive
cloud can follow you out to the suburbs, that shelter is not going to work
because the size of the blast and the size of the nuclear firestorm is so
immense that there is no protection. And so people begin to become skeptical
of these schemes to protect themselves. Nevertheless, the FCDA says, there are some people that are going to be
killed, there are some people that are going to be harmed by radioactive
fallout. Make no mistake about that. But there are still things that you can
do. And in a sense, the revelations of fallout did not change the FCDA
strategy at all. It raised people's awareness about the dangers of nuclear
war, but the strategy of the civil defense establishment remained unchanged.
They were still basing their projections and their advice to the American
people based on the conventional weapons of World War II. And when they talked
about the hydrogen bomb they talked about it as only slightly more powerful
than the atomic bomb. And they continued to say that protection and survival
was possible. The hydrogen bomb shouldn't scare you into malaise, into apathy,
into cynicism, into panic. It should only convince you that more preparation
is needed, not that preparation is impossible.

Springs Eternal: Florida's Fountain of Youth
Introduction
Divers find unseen world harboring strange ecology in NATURE’s Springs Eternal: Florida’s Fountain of Youth.
According to legend, Spanish explorers believed that a fountain of eternal youth bubbled up to the surface somewhere in the place we know today as Florida. In a poetic way, they were right.
Beneath Florida lie hundreds of miles of underwater channels and caves that comprise the world’s largest known system of springs. Largely unchanged since the age of dinosaurs, these springs shelter strange life forms, support improbable ecologies, and dot the land above it with outlets of water that once — before the expansion of Florida’s human population — was as pure as any found on this planet.
With its abundance of alligators, sunfish, eagles, great blue herons, and of course, the gentle and endangered manatee — to name only a few of the state’s better-know fascinating creatures — Florida is a wondrous ecological laboratory, even on its surface. Below the surface, however, is where the real surprises lie.
Follow divers into dangerous and unchartered channels never before seen in NATURE’s Springs Eternal: Florida’s Fountain of Youth.

This is very interesting, even though i still am not sure it is even true??
annemarie johansen
this is interesting and cool
Stewart Thomas
It is very true, indeed. Florida’s underwater system of caves and channels is a little known frontier being explored by divers, dye traces, gps, and other exploration devices. Visit http://www.TheBluePath.org to learn more about how Florida residents are interacting with our water resources, and fighting to preserve the planet’s largest constellation of springs.
