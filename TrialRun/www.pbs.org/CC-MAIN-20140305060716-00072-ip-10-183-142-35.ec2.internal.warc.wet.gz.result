Bill Moyers on Faith & Reason . Portraits . References . Margaret Atwood | PBS
Below you'll find more information on some of the topics touched on in Bill Moyers' conversation with Margaret Atwood. You can also find more information on religion in the news in our main Resources section. Plus you can explore myths and sacred texts and belief and doubt and other matters in our Perspectives section.
Salem Witchcraft TrialsMargaret Atwood refers to the Salem Witchcraft Trials as "one of the foundational events" of American history. Interpretations of the Salem, Massachusetts witchcraft hysteria of 1689 vary from generation to generation. Read the original court documents and learn about the use of "spectral evidence."
Cotton Mather's THE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE WORLDInfluential Puritan cleric Cotton Mather published this defense of belief in witchcraft and the Salem trials in 1693. "Half-hanged Mary"Margaret Atwood wrote this poem about her ancestor, Mary Webster, who, after being accused, and acquitted of witchcraft, was lynched. She survived the attack and thus earned her name, and her freedom. AntinomianismAccording to THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY, antinomianism is "The doctrine or belief that the Gospel frees Christians from required obedience to any law, whether scriptural, civil, or moral, and that salvation is attained solely through faith and the gift of divine grace. Also defined as the belief that moral laws are relative in meaning and application as opposed to fixed or universal. "
"Nobodaddy" Margaret Atwood refers to the poem by 18th century artist and poet William Blake. To Nobodaddy
Why art thou silent & invisible Father of jealousy Why dost thou hide thyself in clouds From every searching Eye
Why darkness & obscurity In all thy words & laws That none dare eat the fruit but from The wily serpents jaws Or is it because Secresy
gains females loud applause William Blake Charles Kingsley, BOOK OF GODS AND HEROESMany generations of children have first encountered Greek and Roman myths through the books of 19th-century historian and author Charles Kingsley. MythWeb: THE ODYSSEY
This resource provides a short and long version of THE ODYSSEY, as well as a detailed index with information on various elements of the story.
Goddess myths
Scholars of religion and culture have documented many tales of female divinity. Learn more about the golden age of the goddess from JOSEPH CAMPBELL AND THE POWER OF MYTH. "The Penelopiad" on stage in England Margaret Atwood and director Phyllida Lloyd discuss their staging of Atwood's novel.

The Case:
A comic book collector in Brooklyn, NY owns several storyboards from a cartoon comic strip dating to the immediate post-World War II period. The strip relates the story of Pete Gray, the first one-armed major league baseball player who later became an icon for disabled WWII veterans. The cartoon world had its golden age from the late 1930’s through the 50’s, and although many period cartoonists were extraordinarily talented, they were also often moonlighting from work in advertising or more “respectable” trades and their identities were often not disclosed.
Who was the artist of this remarkable comic? And why does it feature a real-life human, rather than the more common superhero?
History Detectives examine how comic artists helped reframe popular culture in the mid-20th century.

Relationships
The contentious divorce of Frank and Jamie McCourt is very much in the news in Los Angeles. Married for 30 years, the McCourt’s high-profile divorce settlement pivots on a rather surprising dispute: they cannot agree on which of them owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. Frank has been operating on the assumption that he owns the team, while Jamie’s understanding is that half of it is hers and has been hers all along. As sad as it is that any enduring partnership ends, lucky is the couple with marital problems like these. At stake in this squabble is a professional baseball team – a $700 million asset – replete with Manny Ramirez’ contract and Chavez Ravine. So worry not for the McCourts. They are outrageously wealthy, with any number of recent stories and commentaries in the Los Angeles Times detailing their lavish creature comforts (daily visits from hairstylists), real estate holdings (seven homes, two on adjacent properties in Malibu), and luxurious travel arrangements (by private jet, with his most recent vacation costing $80,000, according to reports). As difficult as it is for most of us wage-earners to imagine this lifestyle – the smaller bungalow in Malibu is used by Jamie only for managing laundry, according to Frank’s attorney, while another home was used by Jamie only for swimming -- there are some crucial lessons to be learned here about the psychology of human intimacy. Lesson #1. In every intimate relationship, the partners operate on the basis of unstated assumptions. Leaving these assumptions unstated can be costly at times, but doing otherwise would be cumbersome. The trick is to know which issues can slide and which issues really require attention. Have you and your partner sat down to discuss who manages the Netflix account, or does this just happen in a catch-as-catch-can manner? No matter, as other things command our attention, and the costs of making a mistake are low. But even when the stakes are higher – and maybe especially then -- the necessary conversations do not always take place. Who among us has had explicit discussions of monogamy, or drug use, or religious differences, or whether you and your partner can take separate vacations? Most of the time we can operate pretty well without these conversations, but we have to recognize that these possible misunderstandings do lurk in the shadows of every relationship.(If you have already inferred that similarity between partners – on race, wealth, education, and religion, values – is beneficial for relationships because it helps to overcome this very problem, then you are ahead of the game. Is it any wonder why matchmaking services focus on similarity?) Lesson #2. If assumptions remain unstated, it follows that partners will see similar things in different ways. Were we snuggling, or was that sex? Was that a date, or was that a trip to the hardware store? Was that a heart-to-heart conversation, or were you just kvetching? If I take care of the kids while I am watching a game on TV, do I get credit for babysitting – or will you see that as personal time? Disagreements like these are the very fabric of all relationships, and partners in healthy couples know that shared perceptions are earned and not assumed.Lesson #3. When unstated assumptions are violated, partners often have strong emotions. Some issues are so obvious to us that we do not even contemplate the possibility that our partner might disagree. “What do you mean you do not want to have a second child?!” “Of course my mom will move in with us after Dad dies – isn’t that why we bought a house with a guest room?” “How could you loan your brother $5000 without checking with me first?” These violated assumptions and the powerful emotions they provoke can be real threats to relationships, and they can force a reassessment of some basic views that both partners hold about the relationship and about one another.Lesson #4. Partners’ assumptions are usually biased in a self-serving direction. Study after study shows that neither of the two people in a relationship have unique access to truth and reality. Most of us are unconsciously motivated to believe that others see the world the way we see it, and most of us perceive the world in ways that makes us look good or advantaged somehow. “Of course I am part-owner of the Dodgers! How could you possibly see it otherwise?!” is not too far removed from “Of course we can take separate vacations! How could you possibly prevent me from having a reunion with my fraternity brothers in Las Vegas?”Lesson #5. Communication matters in part because it allows partners to make constant adjustments about the hazy and amorphous reality that they share. You have read dozens of times that communication is important in good relationships. Why is that? It is because good communication, done well, involves partners checking in with one another about all manner of unstated issues that could erupt to disturb the relationship. Assumptions get checked, problems are averted. “Will you still have time to send in the tax returns? Remember I have that meeting in Pasadena.” “Are you OK with me watching the game when your sister is here? Remember I mentioned it is the last game of the playoffs.” “Was it just me, or did your mom seem upset with us about sending Jason to summer camp? Maybe we should check in with her.” Healthy couples tend to have conversations that delve into the bigger issues, or they have the skills to regulate their emotions when violated assumptions bring these issues to the fore. “A rich man,” wrote W.C. Fields, “is nothing but a poor man with money,” and so it must be: the comforts and resources might be greater among the wealthy but the same buggy perceptual apparatus is at work for all of us. And regardless of our income, when our relationships are thriving, we often do not want to rock the boat with difficult issues. Why bother talking about ownership over the Dodgers if our relationship is going so well? And yet, as they McCourts are learning, as difficult as it is to broach these topics, it is far harder to do so when the relationship starts to struggle and when the attorneys are called in to clear up the confusion.

Interviewing Congressman John Lewis	Production Team March 24, 2012
If you think it’s tricky to find the perfect time to schedule an interview with a celebrity (in between shooting a movie or a TV show, attending premiere parties, making the rounds on talk shows, and hosting fundraising galas for their favorite good cause) think about how much harder it is to settle on a date and time with someone who also has to vote in halls of Congress! That’s how it was trying to book the Congressman representing Atlanta since 1986: John Lewis. He has famously never missed a vote and regardless of how much he wanted to learn about his roots from our host, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., he wasn’t about to start now!
I was a bit overwhelmed by the idea of meeting Representative John Lewis – a living legend. But after reading his impassioned memoir Walking with the Wind, in which he writes of his transformation from humble beginnings to renowned Civil Rights leader, I somehow felt like I already knew him. He has led an illustrious career as a Civil Rights leader: he created the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he integrated lunch counters in Nashville, TN, he spearheaded the Freedom Rides throughout the South, he spoke at the historic March on Washington in 1963 at the age of 23, and perhaps most famously, he led 600 peaceful marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge only to be attacked mercilessly by Alabama state troopers on Bloody Sunday, 1965. More than 40 arrests later, Lewis continues to build a truly integrated “Beloved Community” through his work as Senior Chief Deputy Whip for the Democratic Party and continues to struggle for voting rights. I felt thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to hear him talk about his life and family firsthand.
Congressman John Lewis on Finding Your Roots
When he arrived on location at a townhouse we rented a few blocks from the Capitol, he was kind and patient while we made last minute lighting adjustments. One of his assistants took me aside and told me that Congressman Lewis had been working since 5am and hadn’t had time to eat yet that day (it was now 11:30am). I offered bagels, an assortment of sandwiches, cookies and fruit. Yes, a banana would be perfect and half of a turkey sandwich would make a good snack during an interview break. Another member of his staff pointed at his watch, reminding me that a vote might be called within the hour. In such a case, the Congressman would have to leave within 15 minutes. With that, we began to take Congressman Lewis on a journey back in time.
Dr. Gates showed John Lewis records that documented the tremendous lives of his ancestors who were born into slavery and died land-holding free people. This was one of the most moving interviews that I have ever witnessed. I believe it was as enlightening and powerful for the production team in the room as it was for the Congressman himself, and as it will be for PBS viewers.

Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.
First Amendment
Justice Stevens Decision
June 24, 1976
Excerpt:
Zoning ordinances adopted by the city of Detroit differentiate between motion picture theaters which exhibit sexually explicit "adult" movies and those which do not. The principal question presented by this case is whether that statutory classification is unconstitutional because it is based on the content of communication protected by the First Amendment. ... A remark attributed to Voltaire characterizes our zealous adherence to the principle that the government may not tell the citizen what he may or may not say. Referring to a suggestion that the violent overthrow of tyranny might be legitimate, he said: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." The essence of that comment has been repeated time after time in our decisions invalidating attempts by the government to impose selective controls upon the dissemination of ideas.Thus, the use of streets and parks for the free expression of views on national affairs may not be conditioned upon the sovereign's agreement with what a speaker may intend to say. Nor may speech be curtailed because it invites dispute, creates dissatisfaction with conditions the way they are, or even stirs people to anger. The sovereign's agreement or disagreement with the content of what a speaker has to say may not affect the regulation of the time, place, or manner of presenting the speech.
