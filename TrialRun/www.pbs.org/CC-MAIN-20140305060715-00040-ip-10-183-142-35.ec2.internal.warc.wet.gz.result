Share Biography: Leland Stanford (1824-1893)
Other Biographies
Much like his future partners, Leland Stanford remade himself in gold rush California as a shopkeeper. In 1852, fed up with lawyering, he left the Midwest to become a partner in a wholesale grocery business founded by his brothers. By 1860 the Sacramento store was booming, and Stanford had become its sole proprietor. He had also formed a tight bond with Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, and Edwin and Charles Crocker through Sacramento's new Republican party, which would soon nominate Stanford as its candidate for governor.
A Political ManTo the casual observer he might have seemed an interesting choice. Slow to speak, a deliberate thinker, Stanford was characterized by a plodding nature that repeatedly vexed his railroad partners. However he relished public life, and it was in this capacity that he best served the Central Pacific. As the board of directors took form in 1860, Stanford headed east to lobby for the venture and gain partisan support for his gubernatorial bid. Among Stanford's contacts was president-elect and fellow Republican Abraham Lincoln. Upon Stanford's return to Sacramento in summer 1861, the directors met to name officers. Stanford appointed Theodore Judah and Doc Strong as nominating committee, and, perhaps swayed by his political gravity, they in turn named Stanford president. It was a slight to company mastermind Huntington, who had to settle for vice president -- and the beginning of bad blood that estranged him from Stanford and drove Judah away from the Central Pacific.
Railroad PresidentOn January 8, 1863, Governor Stanford broke ground to inaugurate the Central Pacific's construction. Crowds cheered him that day, but bad choices cost Stanford his governor's office by the end of his first term. Characteristic was his May decision to appoint business partner E. B. Crocker to the California Supreme Court. It was a temporary appointment containing no real conflict of interest, but it looked bad, and caused the governor to lose ground among supporters. Political position had allowed him to funnel state money to the railroad; free from the responsibilities of office, Stanford turned his full attention to railroad duties. However, the president seemed to have trouble motivating himself, leaving the exhausting tasks to his compatriots. When he made decisions on their behalf, the results often sent the Associates scrambling. In 1868 he signed a million-dollar draft without their consultation, making the company captive to the Bank of California. It sent Hopkins into a tailspin. "If it didn't suit Governor Stanford's lazy way as a good fellow doing a large business with clever fellows in a clever manner, it would please me very much better," he complained to Huntington.
Emissary to the MormonsStanford proved of use to the company in the Utah, where he acted as emissary to the Mormons and kept an eye on the competing Union Pacific. In early 1868, as the Central Pacific pushed out of the mountains, the Associates feared they had made a mistake by not keeping a delegate in the camp of Brigham Young. Stanford, the diplomat among them, seemed the person to send. By August of that year he had reached an agreement with Young providing Mormon laborers for Central Pacific grading work.
Frustrating PartnerStanford's characteristic silence and reticent pace repeatedly tried his partners' patience. "We have not heard from Stanford in ten days," Charles Crocker fumed to Huntington. "Don't know what he is doing. I guess nothing -- in fact I never knew him to do much himself -- he is awful lazy & never attends to details -- wants somebody to come along afterward & stop the leaks & do the work." What reconnaissance he did report further harried them. His correspondence contained hare-brained schemes for piercing the canyons and ever-changing speculations of the line's potential location that frustrated the Associates' land-grabbing designs. However, Stanford's partners were sometimes too quick to anger at his work. Stanford's appraisal of Union Pacific's rapid progress, though frustrating, was accurate, as he later by proved to Huntington by escorting him across Utah Territory to see for himself.
A Lasting LegacyTo his colleagues, Stanford's partnership was a source of constant consternation; to Huntington, his role as figurehead a plain insult. Tensions continued to mount after the successes of 1869, as Stanford repeatedly dipped into company holdings to fund construction of palatial homes and the chartering of a private institution. Huntington derided the latter project as "the circus." But Leland Stanford Junior University, named in honor of the cherished son Stanford lost to typhoid in 1884, ensured the most famous of the Big Five a legacy that long outlasted those of his Associates.

Masterpiece Theatre | American Collection | A Death in the Family | Essays + Interviews | Life in a Small Southern Town
James Agee spent his childhood in Knoxville, Tennessee, a community nestled alongside the Tennessee River between the Cumberland Plateau and the Great Smokey Mountains. He set A Death in the Family in the downtown area and the Fort Sanders neighborhood where he was born and where he lived with his family. It was the death of his father in 1916 that marked what was both literally and figuratively an abrupt end to an idyllic childhood.
While downtown Knoxville was a bustling metropolis of about 50,000 people, in 1916 it was still possible to hear the crickets chirping in the evening in Fort Sanders, the center of old time residential Knoxville.
Supper was at six and was over by half past. There was still daylight, shining softly and with a tarnish, like the lining of a shell, and the carbon lamps lifted at the corners were on in the light, and the locusts were started, and the fire flies were out, and a few frogs were flopping in the dewy grass, by the time the fathers and the children came out...
from Knoxville: Summer 1916, James Agee
Knoxville in Agee's youth was a booming industrial city with a densely concentrated population of about 50,000. Electric streetcars carried commuters across concrete viaducts; the sidewalks were sometimes so crowded that people had to walk in the streets. Knoxville in 1916 was shadowed by dozens of lofty buildings, some "skyscrapers" more than 10 stories tall. The Majestic Theater in the book was one of about a dozen movie theaters downtown alone... a larger part of A Death in the Family is set in a residential neighborhood, Highland Avenue, the modest, middle-class side of Fort Sanders.
Jack Neely, Knoxville-based writer and historian

...When the ice wagon came, our mouths were always full of ice, but when the ice cream cart came by and we didn't have a nickel, that was sad.
There were two picture shows and we could go to the "Star" on South Main for 5 cents. Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Harold Lloyd, Norma Talmadge and Tom Mix were some of our favorites. Our funny papers included Mutt and Jeff, The Katzenjammer Kids, Uncle Walt and Skeezix. We grew old along with them...

[Knoxville's] allegiances were divided during the American Civil War; Confederate domination ended in 1863 when Union troops, under General Ambrose Burnside, repelled a Confederate attack led by General James Longstreet. Knoxville quickly rebuilt and established itself as an important commercial center in the South, and in the early 1900s its city limits were expanded.
The City of Knoxville.com
...After the war, its railroads helped Knoxville enter a period of growth. Industries flourished, and new neighborhoods sprouted, including Mechanicsville, Brownlow, Fort Sanders, Old North Knoxville, Fourth & Gill, Emory Place, Park City and others. Streetcars, then automobiles fueled further expansion... The Knoxville News-Sentinal Company
There were the long winter evenings gathered around a roaring log fire in Mama's room. It was then that she read the Bible with us and told us stories, especially of the early history of our family background. Christmas in my days was an exciting and spiritual event, not a commercial extravaganza. In summer we had a play buggy and our horse Old Joe to pull it all over the country side with every kid who desired to hang on to it. We had a ball diamond on the side lawn, and a series of deep blue swimming holes up and down the creek. We had a large double lawn swing under a wide spreading maple tree in the front yard. Whey my two brothers and I were very young, we had a pony with a red bridle and saddle, and a small replica of a farm wagon and harness to which we hitched and drove a large billy goat!

...The Gay Street Bridge was constructed in 1898. Before the bridge was complete, a trolley company had been granted an easement to install tracks across the Gay Street Bridge. Prior to installation of the trolley, South Knoxville had always been fairly isolated from the developing city on the north side of the Tennessee River... Ann Bennett

..Our country home in Tharpe, Tennessee was an impressive, attractive and very comfortable house located in a wide valley, surrounded by about 225 acres of high, timber-clad hills and creek bottom farmland through which a clear spring fed rock bottom stream flowed. The stream was close by the house, and we spent many happy, carefree hours swimming, fishing, and collecting geese and ducks eggs from the creek bed. My mother kept a large flock of geese and ducks, and they found the clear blue waters of the stream inviting....

... In the winter, of course, we went to school every weekday. On Saturday we always had a wide range of activities, a farm-wagon-size sleigh, built on the Mill Yard by one of the Mill hands. We had a gentle old horse named Joe to ride or drive. My brother Frank always did the driving and bossing. Then each of us had a sled of our own, also built by some mill hand, which we could pull to the top of the long hill that ended behind the house. We rode down into a woven wire fence on moonlight nights when the snow was deep and icy slick. What fun! Vara Sykes Wallace

I want to go home, For never a place did I see, Wherever I roam, far away and alone, So dear as my own Tennessee. But now I am far away, To my home I must go soon, I want to go back to hunt for the deer track, And watch for the possum and coon.
I want to go home, For never a place did I see, Wherever I roam far away and alone, So dear as my own Tennessee.
But now I am far away, And lonely and sad is my lot,
I never can rest till my journey is past, And I again seek my old cot. From my childhood's happy home, I never more will roam, I will take by my side, my young Tennessee bride, And live ever happy at home.

Both of my grandparents fought in the War Between the States. Mother's father was badly wounded. I was born on a farm in the southern part of the State, and when I was about four years old my parents moved to town. Four years later father's health failed and the doctors advised him to move back to the country. Father was a teacher and be built the first schoolhouse in that community and taught in it. He and several other men organized the Baptist church and built its house of worship. He was a deacon in that church as long as he lived. One thing sure, just as soon as I am able I'm going back and buy that little old pedal organ that I used to play Sunday school songs on in that old church when I was a girl.

The year 1993 marks my eighty-ninth birthday. These remembrances of my early days in Stewart County were as though it were yesterday. I remember my Grandfather and Grandmother Sykes as far back as I can remember anything. I was very young, even before school age, when I began spending several weeks with them each summer. My Grandfather, James Franklin "Pa" Sykes, and my Grandmother, Mary Wofford Sykes, were important and outstanding members of the community of Fort Henry, Tennessee in Stewart County. He owned a farm, and a very comfortable country home near the small village. The village of Fort Henry was located between the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers where they came closest together -- about ten miles apart. His farm was located about one and one-half miles from the Tennessee River where he cultivated corn in the river bottom fields... Vara Sykes Wallace

Producer Rick Young remembers a departed steel worker and worries about the future for his widowed wife -- and for all retired women.
On March 23, 2006, an overflow crowd of more than 500 gathered in a church in the Cleveland suburb of Macedonia to bid farewell to Chuck Kurilko. Most of those who came knew Chuck as the big, gregarious, four-fingered hockey coach of the Garfield Bulldogs -- a club where he'd helped kids of all ages for some 30 years.
But when I first met Chuck, in January this year, I knew him only as a guy who'd spent his entire life working at the local steel mill. I'd come to Cleveland to understand more about the bankruptcy of LTV Steel and how it had affected thousands of retirees. LTV was one of the first cases in a recent trend of big corporations using Chapter 11 bankruptcy to walk away from their pensions and other retiree benefits. With the help of the Steelworkers Local 979, I called on several former LTV workers, and late one afternoon I pulled up to a white, single-story house along a classic middle-American street, where I met Chuck and his wife Carolyn.
HIGH LOW
LTV's Bankruptcy - A Bellwether Case - What happened to workers' pensions and health care benefits when LTV Steel went bankrupt with its pension fund $2 billion in the red.
We sat at their dining table, wedged between the living room and kitchen, Carolyn keeping Chuck's 64-ounce plastic mug filled with iced tea. We talked about how they'd come to Cleveland. High school sweethearts in southwestern Pennsylvania, they were married not long after Chuck, at 18, followed up on an ad in the local paper for steel mills hiring in northeast Ohio. They never looked back. "He loved it. He enjoyed every day," remembered Carolyn. "He worked because he had something to work for. We were raising our children, and he said, 'Just have patience. Let's educate our children, and then there will be time and enough money for me and you later.'" We talked well into the evening, mostly about Chuck's love of the steel mill and some, of course, about hockey. And we also talked about fear. Chuck had already had two heart attacks and multiple episodes of congestive heart failure; the fear of another, perhaps fatal, incident was on both their minds. Yet sadly, it wasn't the fear of dying they seemed most concerned about, but rather the fear of living in poverty. After 38 years in the mill (most of it working night shifts so he could be with his kids after school), Chuck had retired from LTV in late 2001 with a lifetime pension and guaranteed health coverage for himself and Carolyn. "It was looking great," recalled Chuck. "The first retirement check I got was $2,700 a month. And that's a nice pension." Health insurance, he said, was running about $200 a month.
But the Kurilko's retirement security didn't last long. Through bankruptcy, LTV had sold off its productive assets and jettisoned its unwanted and underfunded liabilities, like pension and health benefits. LTV's pensions were taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC), the federal corporation that insures private pensions. PBGC uses a reduced payout formula for retirees under 65, and retirees like Chuck were among the hardest hit. He saw his monthly pension checks slashed by $1,000, and his monthly health insurance payment skyrocket to $1,300. The bankruptcy proceedings that "saved" LTV cost the Kurilkos about $25,000 a year, a devastating turnabout in fortunes. By the time I arrived, the Kurilkos' savings were down to about $13,000. Every month was a struggle to keep from digging the financial hole deeper. I expected anger and dismay. What I found was more troubling. Good people that had been justifiably proud of what they'd accomplished through a lifetime of hard work -- in the mill, in their community and at home -- had lost control of their financial future, and with that their dignity. "We just shouldn't have to live like this," Carolyn kept saying, shaking her head as if it was all just a bad dream.
A couple months later, Carolyn's nightmare got worse. She called me in early April to tell me that Chuck had died from a massive heart attack. We talked about Chuck and about his funeral, and after we talked, I began to think about how Chuck's passing had come to represent the passing of an era when a lifetime of hard work, at most big companies, was rewarded with retirement security and with dignity. I also thought about Carolyn and the financial predicament she suddenly faced alone. But it wasn't until later that I came to understand that Carolyn too represents a troubling national trend -- the growing number of women facing severe financial difficulty in retirement.
One huge problem in retirement for women like Carolyn Kurilko is longevity. On average, women live longer than men, and nearly a third of all women who reach 65 will live to at least 90. "Chances are the husband will die and the wife will live on and on and on, and she will be the poorest she's ever been in her whole life," explains Notre Dame labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci.
The other mounting difficulty for women is the rapid shift from lifetime pensions to 401(k) plans in America's retirement strategy. While 401(k)s offer some benefits like portability -- women tend to stay in jobs for shorter periods than men -- the effectiveness of the plans is dependent on consistent long-term savings and wise investment decisions, particularly with lump-sum distributions at retirement. All the data suggests that people are saving way too little, way too late.
Some experts believe women will be hit particularly hard by the convergence of longevity, rising health care costs and our increasing dependence on 401(k)s. It's telling that one in four elderly women without husbands are living in or near poverty already. Among single women over 85, the number is more like one in three, according to the Center on Retirement Research at Boston College.
Ghilarducci says the problem of poverty among elderly women is getting worse, and she points a finger directly at 401(k)s. "The culprit [are] these defined contribution [401(k)] plans," she says. "Most older women over the age of 80 are living alone, and they are without their kids and without their husbands and they face the highest risk of poverty that they have ever faced in their entire lives. And they won't be able to go back to work to make up for that income. It's a national tragedy."
In one sense, Carolyn Kurilko is lucky. Her kids are helping her out financially. She hopes she can afford to stay in her house another year before having to move in with her daughter. As she sorts through all the paperwork of pension and Social Security benefits, Carolyn is increasingly uncertain about being able to patch together a liveable income. "People are going to have to feed me," she says, pausing before returning once again to the stark reality she can't seem to get beyond.
