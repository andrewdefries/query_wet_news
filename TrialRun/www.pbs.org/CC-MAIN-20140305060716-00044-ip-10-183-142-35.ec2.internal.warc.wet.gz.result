l Big brains	A talk on the dark side with Brian Greene By Win Rosenfeld October 4, 2011
Three Americans physicists took home the Nobel Prize today for demonstrating that the expansion of the known universe is accelerating. The discovery supports the notion that a mysterious force called “dark energy” is pushing the cosmos apart. Dark energy has been a top priority for many in the astrophysics community, because the long standing conventional wisdom was that the expansion of the universe is actually slowing down due to gravitational forces. The notion that dark energy may be “pushing” harder than gravity is “pulling” has major repercussions for how the universe will look in the distant future.
Last year, I spoke with bestselling author and Columbia physics professor Brian Greene about why the existence of dark energy spells trouble for stargazers.

Old Sol is middle-aged, will become too hot for life to exist on Earth in one billion years, and will fade from view six billion years later. So I wonder if humans will even be “in the vicinity” to see the starless sky, 100 billion years from now when the expanding universe has swept all the stars away. Robert Braun, astronomy and space chief at Australia’s government science agency CSIRO, said it would be impossible to notice the number of stars diminishing in a human lifetime, but were
someone to live for one billion years they would “see things changing
very dramatically” in the skies above. Ah, but I bet he’d be napping at the end and would probably miss it.
