Bill Moyers on Faith & Reason . Perspectives . Faith & Science. God & Darwin | PBS
THE BATTLE OVER EVOLUTIONA major museum retrospective on Darwin in New York City and several recent court decisions have ensured that evolution and creation are still under hot debate in the United States. Faith & Reason guest, scientist and believer Sir John Houghton has no trouble making peace between his faith and evolution:
I began to read about evolution and realized...biological evolution was just the way things seemed to have happened at least to some degree. And I thought, "Well, if God makes it that way, that's fine."... He's really made things make themselves."
Several years ago Bill Moyers and eminent scientist and author Richard Dawkins discussed the ongoing controversy over the teaching of evolution in American schools. The author, of among other titles, THE GOD DELUSIONS, Dawkins takes another angle remarking:
All materials should be studied with an open mind, studied critically, etcetera. I'm all for that. What's wrong is to single out evolution as though that is any more open to doubt than anything else...Among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know. And that, of course, as you know, is accepted by responsible educated churchmen, as well as scientists.
However, a 2004 CBS News poll indicates why evolution remains a battleground in America. The poll found that just 13 percent say that God was not involved in the process of creating humans. Fifty-five percent said God created humans in their present form. Overall, about two-thirds of Americans want creationism taught along with evolution. Only 37 percent want evolutionism replaced outright. Sixty percent of Americans who call themselves Evangelical Christians, however, favor replacing evolution with creationism in schools altogether. So do 50 percent of those who attend religious services every week. These findings echo those of a series of Gallup polls conducted in 1982, 1993, 1997, 1999 and 2001. In that series of polls no fewer than 44% of those responding subscribed to a strict creationist view.
Read more about the history of the American Darwin battle and then join the discussion.
CHARLES DARWIN'S DAY Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was published in THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES in 1859. Although Darwin carefully avoided discussion of the evolution of humans in the book, beyond the famous sentence "Much light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history," readers and critics were quick to acknowledge that the theory had great implications for ideas of human development. Within a decade there were sixteen editions of ORIGIN in England and America and translations into six European languages. Simplified and popularized views of Darwin's theories were both lauded and parodied  as can be seen in the contemporary cartoon to the left which shows Darwin as half-man and half-ape. Victorians could sing a "Darwinian Theory" piano duet and purchase a Wedgewood bowl illustrating the "tree of life."
A widely-covered event helped Darwin's theories gain popular acceptance in England. The British Association in Oxford held a debate between evolution foe Bishop Samuel Wilberforce and evolution supporter scientist T. H. Huxley on June 30, 1860. Although he started the debate as underdog, newspaper accounts of the day named Huxley as the winner. Darwin's Dangerous Idea: EVOLUTION on PBS

THE MONKEY TRIALPopularly known as "The Monkey Trial," the battle between two of America's most famous orators, William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow, was actually Tennessee v. John Scopes. In 1925 Dayton, Tennessee teacher John Scopes agreed to be a test case against a state law prohibiting the teaching of evolution in the public schools. The case became a national phenomenon  pitting the religious former Presidential candidate Bryan against the American Civil Liberties Union and America's most famous lawyer Darrow. Covered in the press by H.L. Mencken and carried live on a Chicago radio station, the trail riveted the nation. The jury convicted Scopes for breaking the state law, but Darrow's stinging cross-examination of Bryan as a Biblical expert made him the winner in the popular mind. The crusade against evolution in the schools became dormant for several decades. Read more about court challenges of the 1960s and 1980s from EVOLUTION on PBS.

AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: The Monkey Trial
21ST CENTURY SCHOOLYARD BATTLES new MATERIAL
Many observers of the battle view a December 2005 court ruling as a blow to the intelligent design forces. The case concerned a school board policy in Dover, Pennsylvania where the school district mandated that a theory called "intelligent design" be taught along with evolution in public schools. Intelligent design, the counterpart to evolution presented by the creationist movement, maintains that because of its complexity, life on Earth was created by an intelligent being, not by the evolutionary forces of change over time. Federal Judge John Jones ruled that evolution must be taught in science classes, and that intelligent design had no place in those same classes. His ruling stated "We find that the secular purposes claimed by the board amount to a pretext for the board's real purpose, which was to promote religion." And, another federal judge in Georgia ruled against a policy of the Cobb Country school district which required that a sticker be placed on science books reading "This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered." In his ruling Judge Clarence Cooper wrote: "Due to the manner in which the sticker refers to evolution as a theory, the sticker also has the effect of undermining evolution education to the benefit of those Cobb County citizens who would prefer that students maintain their religious beliefs regarding the origin of life." But the battles in the school yard show little sign of abating. In Grantsburg, Wisconsin, school officials revised the science curriculum to allow the teaching of creationism, prompting an outcry from more than 300 educators who urge that the decision be reversed. Members of Grantsburg's school board believed that a state law governing the teaching of evolution was too restrictive. The science curriculum "should not be totally inclusive of just one scientific theory," said Joni Burgin, superintendent of the district. The controversy is reaching beyond school systems. Recently several scientific organizations and the superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park requested that a book presenting a creationist view of the formation of the canyon be removed from the scientific section of the park book store.

Billy Frank, Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission
For thousands of years, salmon was a major food source in the Northwest and regarded as a symbol of abundance, prosperity, persistence, instinct and determination by the Native Americans living there. The Native Americans understood that for all their abundance, salmon were fragile. The salmon could easily be over-fished and their numbers greatly reduced. Today, Seattle's salmon have been pushed to near extinction. Commercial fishing, hydroelectric dams and the destruction of the natural habitat and global warming have all contributed to the salmon's decline. New buildings and roads, auto exhausts, fertilizers, pesticides and antiquated septic tanks have turned Seattle's Puget Sound into a toxic environment for its salmon. Native American activists like Billy Frank are working hard to address this problem. Frank, 73, is no stranger to activism. During protests to regain fishing rights for his tribe in the 1970's, he was arrested more than 50 times. Eventually, his tribe won back their rights, but then discovered there were few salmon left to catch. Since 1981, Frank has chaired the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, a coalition of 20 western Washington treaty tribes working on sustainable solutions for saving the salmon.

Transcript
Despite the hard work of activists like Billy Frank, 90 percent of the wild pacific salmon fish runs are gone, while the national appetite for this delicious food increases. Fortunately, Seattle's government takes this problem seriously. Local, federal and state agencies have invested millions of dollars to protect and enhance the fish's habitat and they anticipate investing millions more.

Death is Different
"The truth of it in this country is that the law exists to protect everybody. And in particular, that has its greatest force when it's protecting the weakest and the most undesirable. The protection of their rights really is what insures the protection of everybody's rights. You blow through theirs; it's a lot easier to blow through somebody else's."
--McClatchy News Service reporter Stephen Henderson
The Supreme Court has ruled that even convicted murderers have a right to a vigorous defense when a jury is deciding whether or not to execute them. In an extraordinary four-year investigation, McClatchy Supreme Court beat-reporter Stephen Henderson finds that defense lawyers in four states are failing that test; as a result their clients - even those who have suffered lifetimes of abuse and/or have IQs suggesting mental retardation - are heading to death row. Henderson takes EXPOSÉ inside the world of death penalty defense armed only with a reporter's notebook and the pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution he carries everywhere he goes. Henderson doesn't only expose defense efforts gone wrong. He also introduces EXPOSÉ to a group of public defenders who go the extra mile, with striking results. Read Stephen Henderson's original reporting, "No Defense: Shortcut to Death Row," which appeared in McClatchy papers around the country in January 2007.

Teaching Your Teen Money Management
July 18th, 2011, by Michelle Singletary	Q: My daughter is working for the first time this summer. How should I help her manage her money?
A: I can totally identify. My 16-year-old daughter started her first job this summer, working at a summer camp. I’m so proud of her. She hasn’t gotten her first paycheck yet, but we have had numerous conversations about what she should do with her summer salary.
For example, we’ve told our daughter we expect her to tithe or give a tenth of her income to our church. That’s a family value we hold, and we are teaching it to our children. If this is something your family believes in, teach it to your children at a young age, so it won’t be as hard later to tithe when they are making more money.
Talk to your daughter about saving part of her pay for both short-term and long-term things she may need and want. Now is the time to get her into the habit of saving something from every dollar she earns or is given.
Once she gets paid, help her create a budget.
Talk about taxes. Will she need to have money taken out of her pay for taxes? The Internal Revenue Service provides tips for students starting a summer job. Here are a few of them:
•	When you first start a new job, you must fill out a Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. This form is used by employers to determine the amount of tax that will be withheld from your paycheck. If you have multiple summer jobs, make sure all your employers are withholding an adequate amount of taxes to cover your total income tax liability. To make sure your withholding is correct, use the IRS Withholding Calculator.
•	Whether you are working as a waiter or a camp counselor, you may receive tips as part of your summer income. All tips you receive are taxable income and are therefore subject to federal income tax.
•	Many students do odd jobs over the summer to make extra cash. Earnings you receive from self-employment—including jobs like baby-sitting and lawn mowing—are subject to income tax.
It’s your job to teach your children good money management. You don’t have to dictate how they spend or that they save every penny, but you should be providing guidance.
