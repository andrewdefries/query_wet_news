“I didn’t want to make what looked like art,” Cindy Sherman says about her earliest works, explaining that “film has always kind of been more influential to me than the art world.” The segment surveys thirty years of untitled works in which the artist photographs herself in various scenes and guises, grouped into informally-named series such as fairy tales, centerfolds, history portraits, Hollywood/Hampton types, and clowns. Sherman used a digital camera and green screen for her most recent series of society portraits, modifying each image’s “background with the same kind of license that a painter would take.” Sorting through test shots at the computer, Sherman leads the viewer through her iterative process. The segment later follows her to a thrift store where, upon finding several “wacky pants” she wonders if this shopping trip “might be inspiring a whole new series.”

Pepper Chicken Stew Recipe | Fresh Tastes Blog | PBS Food
home recipes video shows Blogs shop valentine's day Brighten Up Dinner with This Pepper Chicken Stew
Marc Matsumoto | October 1, 2013
With winter fast approaching and the days growing shorter, I often find myself craving something bright and sunny, and yet the cooler weather outside warrants something richer. This vibrant stew fits the bill with a burst of sunny colors and bright flavors that take you back to summer, but with big chunks of chicken in a hearty sauce that will also keep you warm and satisfied.
Although the name may sound spicy, this stew is about as mild as they come. That’s because the peppers used are paprika and bell peppers. While most people think of peppers as a way to add heat, in many cultures, peppers are added to bring sweetness to a dish.
In this dish, the peppers together with the tomatoes contribute fruity notes and a sweet and sour taste that plays nicely with the savory chicken. The best part of using chicken over another meat such as beef is that it cooks tender much faster. With a few tablespoons of tomato paste, this stew tastes like it’s been simmering for hours, when all it takes is a few minutes of browning, a few minutes of caramelizing, and about ten minutes of simmering.
Pepper Chicken StewAre you missing the warmer months? Food blogger Marc Matsumoto brings you back to the sunny days of Summer with this stew on the Fresh Tastes blog. Ingredients500 grams (17.6 ounces) chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces1 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil3 cloves of garlic, (10 grams / 0.35 ounces) minced1 onion, (170 grams / 6 ounces) diced1 red bell pepper, (150 grams / 5.3 ounces) cut into 1-inch squares1 yellow bell pepper, (150 grams 5.3 ounces) cut into 1-inch squares1 tablespoon sweet paprika 400 grams (14.1 ounces) stewed tomatoes, pureed2 tablespoons tomato paste½ teaspoon saltflat-leaf parsley for garnishDirectionsGenerously salt and pepper the thighs and then dust with the flour. Heat a saute pan over medium high heat until hot and then add the olive oil. Swirl to coat and then add the chicken. Fry on one side until browned and then flip. Brown the second side and then transfer the chicken to a bowl. Add the garlic and onion and saute until tender and starting to brown. Add the bell peppers and continue sauteing until the peppers are bright in color and beginning to soften. Add the paprika and saute until very fragrant. Return the chicken to the pan along with the stewed tomatoes, salt and tomato paste. Simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the bell peppers are tender.Taste, and add more salt if needed. Garnish with chopped parsley. Marc Matsumoto is a culinary consultant and recipe repairman who shares his passion for good food through his website norecipes.com. For Marc, food is a life long journey of exploration, discovery and experimentation and he shares his escapades through his blog in the hopes that he inspires others to find their own culinary adventures. Marc’s been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, and has made multiple appearances on NPR and the Food Network.

Mark, what do you think should be said about Howard Dean tonight?MARK SHIELDS: Jim, Howard Dean… I thought it was a terrific discussion and there’s some terrific points made. One of which I want to amplify on. Howard Dean gave the Democrats their voice. In spite of the “Washington Post” editorial page, in spite of the establishment and the “New Republic” and the… all the best minds saying this is a great war, 70 percent of Democratic primary voters in state after state were opposed to the United States’ invasion and occupation of Iraq.Howard Dean stood up and spoke against it, gave the Democrats their voice, and gave the other Democratic candidates their vertebrae. When he began, Dick Gephardt, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, John Edwards were all explaining, qualifying, defending their vote. Today every one of them… I mean certainly John Kerry and John Edwards sound a lot more like Howard Dean than he did like them. I think that’s the most important thing he did. The second thing he did was he gave the Democratic Party back its soul on fundraising.JIM LEHRER: Its soul?MARK SHIELDS: Its soul on fundraising. The Democratic Party had mortgaged its independence and integrity during the Clinton years to big money and all the rest of it and Lincoln bedroom sleep-overs to big money and all the rest of it, and he showed you could do it the right way with small contributions.JIM LEHRER: He raised $41 million.MARK SHIELDS: $41 million plus. And the most important thing, one out of four of us his contributors was under the age of 30. That is an amazing, remarkable achievement. You can’t get voters but they’re writing checks for him.DAVID BROOKS: He shows we cover money too much. Money doesn’t matter. He might have spent closer to $50 million. He’s in debt right now. He won zero primaries so money… let’s not exaggerate the role of money in this race.MARK SHIELDS: The other guy has $200 million, David.DAVID BROOKS: In the future we’ll see about that.JIM LEHRER: What else would you add or subtract?DAVID BROOKS: I would disagree about how much he’s helped the party. Mark said 75 percent of the primary voters opposed the war. 65 percent of Americans support going to the war, still support going to war. I think he made it harder for the Democrats in the fall in this way, in a subtle way. Clinton always said “there’s no us and them; There’s just us.” Clinton had a center out way of building majority. I think Howard Dean ran against Clinton and deeply against the Clinton methodology.I think that’s going to hurt Democrats a little in the fall. I think the support that John Kerry and John Edwards did not give to the $87 billion bill for supporting… for the troops in Iraq, they would have voted for it if not for Howard Dean. I think that may come back to haunt them though I do agree finally with mark on the way he did cleanse the soul from what he really could call the Ron Brown disease which did infect the party.MARK SHIELDS: And still infects the Republicans.JIM LEHRER: What about the point though that he did mobilize an awful lot of young people who were not… not only were they not supporting… they weren’t supporting anybody and probably would not have supported anybody if Howard Dean hadn’t come along. What kind of points do you give him for that and what happens to them now?DAVID BROOKS: In some way… the Deaniacs won’t like this, but in some way the race reminded me of the Pat Robertson race in 1988. Robertson mobilized the religious right. Dean mobilized a group of people, the secular left or something like that you could call them. They had not been mobilized. He mobilized them, he put them together. The infrastructure is now there. They were never going to be the majority of the party.I really think you know we over estimated. We made too much of a big deal about him months ago. He had 18 percent of the primary vote. I don’t think it was ever going to get higher but it’s a solid 18 percent and it is still sitting out there for some candidate who can mobilize those people again just as the religious right is sitting out and needs to be mobilized.JIM LEHRER: Is that a good comparison, Mark?MARK SHIELDS: I don’t think it is, Jim. I think if you look at Howard Dean, I mean, timing is everything in politics. The mistake he made was getting the covers of “Time” and “Newsweek” as Kwame said in the set up piece in August.JIM LEHRER: Too early?MARK SHIELDS: For four months he was the target. It was the target of the press that didn’t like him. He was the target as well of all his competitors. John Kerry, as I look at it, has been front-runner for exactly three weeks. He’s already restless in that position without the scrutiny. Yes, he did. I thought both the point that Matea and Karen made particularly about the mistake he made about did the president know before September 11?I think what changed the race for him he was the John the Baptist. He made the case for what had to be done by the Democrats. I had two Democrats in Iowa tell me in December– and I should have listened to them– that they had decided to vote for John Kerry rather than Howard Dean even though they liked dean better after they saw George Bush go to Iraq on thanksgiving. They said this election is going to be fought on national security.JIM LEHRER: David, all that’s been said about it and will be said about it when it comes time to look back on 2004 and this election year, will Howard Dean be a small asterisk or a large asterisk or will he be mentioned at all?DAVID BROOKS: He’ll be a big story. He is the most interesting thing that’s happened this year, the rise and fall of him as a person and of the movement he’s created. He’s a big story.JIM LEHRER: You agree it’s a big story?MARK SHIELDS: Most people run for president and leave no footprints or fingerprints. Everybody in politics wants Howard Dean supporters, his list, how do you do it?JIM LEHRER: He said in his statement I think I’m going to keep them and I’m not going to give them to John Kerry or John Edwards or anybody else. Thank you both. See you on Friday night.MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.
