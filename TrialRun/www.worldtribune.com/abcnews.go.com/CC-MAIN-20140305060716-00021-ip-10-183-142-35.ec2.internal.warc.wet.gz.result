How Often Will My PSA Be Checked After Surgery?
March 16, 2009
Khurshid Guru, M.D., Director, Robotic Surgery, Roswell Park Cancer Institute Question: How often will my PSA be checked after surgery?
Answer: The PSA is a test which is required to be checked after a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. And this test is performed as per the NCCN guidelines within one month or four to six weeks after surgery the first PSA test is performed, and after that, every three months. And once you progress in your course of the disease, the PSA can be measured every three months or every six months or once a year depending upon the disease and the status of the PSA. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 6567371.

Twisted Viewpoint
February 15, 2014
TIM KEOWN via ESPN At a time when we've lost much of our capacity to be stunned, the level of systemic abuse detailed in Ted Wells' report on life inside the Dolphins' locker room is truly stunning. Richie Incognito was a virus running unchecked, several other Dolphins were carriers, and Jonathan Martin contracted the most severe -- but by no means only -- case.
Spurs Dominate HeatSteve Smith's Future In CarolinaMcShay's New No. 1Getting To Know Manusc
It's tempting to say something far-reaching and wide-ranging about The Game and how its structure and mores retard human development. It's tempting to indict the league and the Dolphins for continuing a tradition of slipshod treatment of mental-health issues through their lack of follow-up after Martin was treated for depression last spring. It's more than tempting to take one last run at excoriating Incognito for his seemingly sociopathic behavior and its ability to flow seamlessly through the daily routines of NFL life.
The Wells report highlights the disconnect between NFL culture and the world at large. Some of this disconnect is understandable, even necessary. It's not a "normal" workplace, and some leeway can be given for the nature of the profession. The Wells report is clear-eyed in its understanding of this world -- its vulgarity and insults -- and yet still comes across as stunned as lawyer-ese will allow. This was a toxic place among toxic places, and Martin -- a man uniquely unsuited to deal with the savagery -- wasn't the only one who was poisoned.
The scene inside the Dolphins' locker room is condensed to this: weakness masked as strength, strength as weakness. Incognito, Mike Pouncey and John Jerry were perceived as the strong ones, uniting to torment Martin and others under the guise of toughening them up. Martin was the weak one, walking away from a physical confrontation after determining that it would be detrimental to himself and the team.
Incognito was the "team" guy, right? Member of the Leadership Council, bell cow for the offensive line, self-appointed hardener of the soft, he comes across in the report as a terribly divisive man whose bizarre and disgusting behavior cost the team a starting offensive lineman and subjected it to a phenomenal amount of unwanted scrutiny.
However you want to describe Martin's response to the constant badgering -- abashed complicity, courage, fear -- it's obvious he was a far better example of maturity than the bullying band of brothers that assembled to taunt him.
It's fascinating to learn, through Martin's messages to his mother, that Martin's feelings of inadequacy seemed to stem in large part from his academic success. An upper-middle-class black man with a run of good schools in his background, he was looked upon skeptically, as someone who might commit the unforgivable offense (in Incognito's world) of having more than one thought running through his head at any given time. Martin wrote, "I mostly blame the soft schools I went to, which fostered within me a feeling that I'm a huge p---y, as I never got into fights."

Scientists Discover Mosquito's 'Nose'

It might seem surprising that a mosquito can smell at all, since it has no nose. But it uses its antennae to smell, and the genes discovered by the researchers are expressed only in the antennae, further evidence of their role.

Calif. Teen Alyssa Byrne Missing Since New Year's Eve Found Dead

Authorities have found the body of Alyssa Byrne, the 19-year-old California woman who had been missing since New Year's Eve.
Byrne, of Petaluma, Calif., was last seen by friends around 11:30 p.m. at Snow Globe, a three-day music festival in South Lake Tahoe, Nev., that attracts thousands of people, police said.
A utility worker discovered her body, uncovered, lying in a snow bank this morning on the side of the road between the Snow Globe Festival and a hotel, the Douglas County Sheriff's Department said in a news conference today.
There were no signs of outward trauma and no foul play is suspected. A full autopsy report is being conducted to determine the cause of death.
Investigators said Byrne appears to have attempted to walk back to her hotel because of long lines waiting to get on shuttle buses.
"There were some transportation issues at the event, quite long lines, and a lot of people who attended the event elected to walk back instead of taking the shuttle buses. Our preliminary investigation with this morning's discovery, it would tend to point that direction that Alyssa had elected to walk home from the event," Douglas County Undersheriff Paul Howell said at a news conference today.
Police are also investigating Byrne's cellphone activity, which shows calls were placed around midnight Monday after she was last seen. Investigators are unsure, however, whether the phone was used by Byrne or someone else.
Another part of the police investigation is a series of tweets from Byrne's account that night, which make reference to a "falling out" with a friend.
"After tonight you'll never be apart of my life you won't be a memory of 2013 a new year you'll never be apart your nothing to me," @alyssa_byrne1 tweeted on Dec. 31.
"Just lost all my trust in the person I trusted most," the following tweet read.
"We've identified the person that she was referring to. It was a friend, they had a falling out and in speaking to the family and other friends that was not an event that we would at this point label as something that pushed her 'over the edge,'" Howell said today. "We don't think that was a significant issue at this time."
Byrne had reportedly told friends she was returning to the group's hotel room at the Horizon Casino Resort in Stateline and was then unreachable.
"She basically just left and I called her back and she was on the bus back to the hotel," said Jay Donnellan, according to ABC affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco.
When Donnellan returned to the hotel around 12:30 a.m., Byrne was not in her room.
"Once we got back to the room, we noticed she wasn't there. We were calling her, back-to-back, sending her text messages," Donnellan told KGO.
Byrne's family in Petaluma said before today's discovery that she had no history of running away.
Hundreds of people searched the area around Tahoe casinos for Byrne until dark Thursday night.
