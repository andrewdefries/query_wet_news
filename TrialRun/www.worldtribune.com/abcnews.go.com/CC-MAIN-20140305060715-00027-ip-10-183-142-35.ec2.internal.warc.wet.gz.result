Portraits of the Biggest Comedic Stars
In a project taking a year and a half, Matt Hoyle was granted extraordinary access to the biggest comedic stars. From industry pioneers of yesteryear to the breakout stars of today.

Yup.... See More the story with the big yellow duck traveling the globe? Abc's john donvan on the huge sensation heading our way. Reporter: Look what everybody's looking at this week in hong kong by the water. Yup. That's it. Just a rubber ducky. Only it's big, this duck, like five stories high, and it's world traveling, having bobbed so far through or near paris, osacka japan, saw paolo, breal, auckland, neeld, and sydney, australia, where they had to raise the bridge to let him through. And always there's a crowd stuck to the spot, mesmerized through the duck, saying nothing, and only stares back at you. But you can't not look and the dutch artist who created it thinks that's because of childhood. It brings people together. They're the global warriors of our bathtub. Reporter: Of course, give a certain turn of mind, giant duck crowds lured in by it. This could be horror-movie stuff! But no the duck is sweet and nice and gently gliding soon, in fact, to america, though where exactly, the duck's not saying. We'll know when he gets there. John donvan, abc news, washington.
