But now, a looming labor action by airport workers could make today's travel troubles even worse. Abc's cecilia vega has the latest from los angeles international airport. Good morning, see celia. Reporter: Good morning, elizabeth. As hundreds of travelers plan to board their flights, hundreds of workers all around the country are preparing for the major protest. Another potential snag for that holiday traveler. Airport union workers preparing to strike this morning at l.A.X., Admit they could not have picked a worse day or a busier airport to do it.

And while you can bring the turkey, don't try to stuff the cranberry sauce in your purse. It's a liquid. And the tsa won't allow it. Sound like a lot of work? Just look on the bright side. It's bert than a 20-hour drive. I'll be flying. Reporter: Yeah. Certainly wishing happy traveling to all today. Perhaps the most important tip of the day, especially with the potential protests, show up early. The recommendation here in los angeles, two hours early for a domestic flight. Three hours for international. Do not forget the patience. That's the holiday travel. And for all of you that want This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

In Pain? Your Favorite Food May Get You Through It
Aug. 1, 2008 Page 2 of 2
Although there is no data on which type of fantasy is more effective for coping with pain, including less visceral techniques such as meditation, Hekmat suspects that those results would vary highly according to the individual and would be one area to further his research.
And compared to soothing imagery, the titillating effects of food and sex may be an effect some people prefer when they are in pain.
"Pleasurable response derived from excitement may facilitate the involvement of internal opioid mechanisms to counteract pain," Hekmat said. "Excitement absorbs attention and pleasant imagery can induce hypnotic-like states that detracts from pain, improves positive mood and reinforces personal belief in the manageability of pain." -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 5475061.
