When a Child Is Diagnosed: A Psychologist's Advice
Nov. 20, 2005 Page 2 of 3
GOODHEART: It's helpful if the parents can keep their own fear under control and not speculate wildly. It's important to break it down into manageable moments and manageable pieces of information; "X-rays don't hurt, but you have to lie very still. Mommy will stay with you and hold your hand."
ABC NEWS: Cancer is a fatal illness. At what level does a child understand that, and how directly should that be addressed?
GOODHEART: Cancer is not always a fatal illness. It used to be two generations ago, but cancer is treated as a chronic disease now. And people, including children, can often live for very many years with cancer. The cure rates for some kinds of childhood cancer are now very high. So it's important not to assume it's a fatal disease.
ABC NEWS: But sometimes it is. How do you approach the subject of death with a child in those cases?
GOODHEART: There is a study which found parents have no regrets if they talk to their child about death ahead of time. But they did feel some regret if they did not talk to their dying child about death.
I think the main thing is to tell a child that there will be no more pain or fear or worry.
Some parents feel like they cannot tell a child, and they will ask a doctor to do it. Sometimes, children understand that animals, plants, people, all are born, all die and the living is in between. The main thing is to comfort the child because there is a lot of fear of the unknown: that they will have no more pain, no more worry and the parents and the family will be with them.
What you can promise a child is that they'll be comfortable. It's important not to promise what you can't deliver. And it's also very important to allow the child to express his or her fears, because sometimes it's a very small concrete thing that you can do something about.
Some children as young as 9 make plans. They make a little will, or they want to give certain favored possessions to a brother or sister or friend. Sometimes children worry, what will happen to my family afterward? And one of the things a family can do is to say, you will always be part of our family. We will always be a family together. I know one family that lost a child that celebrates that child's birthday every year. They always do a special event that's fun. And the family talked about this together and made those plans with the child, because that's what the child wanted.
ABC NEWS: How should the family handle the other children?
GOODHEART: When a child is dying, depending on the age of the other children, you want to include those children in any memorial planning. The siblings also need an opportunity to express their feelings and fear. The siblings will sometimes get angry that the sick child is getting attention and then they sometimes feel guilty about it. Depending on their temperament, different siblings will have different reactions. So you might have the child who feels he or she has to be very, very good all the time. Or you might have a child who seems quite callous. And that's because they can't bear to think about it. It's also important to remember that there's no time limit to grief when a sibling is lost. And oftentimes people process it many years later. They process it over and over again, so the way they process it at 8 or 10 or 12 may not be the way they process it when they're 25.
ABC NEWS: Are there any mistakes a family in this situation can make?

Share ABC Entertainment News | ABC Business News
Copy
Merrill Newman, an 85-year-old Korean War veteran who had been held in North Korea for more than a month, arrived in the U.S. today after he was deported from the communist nation.
"I'm delighted to be home," Newman said in the San Francisco International airport after he arrived, while standing next to his wife and son. "It's been a great homecoming. I'm tired, but ready to be with my family."
He also thanked the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, North Korea, and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for helping to secure his release. Newman did not elaborate on his weeks-long detention in North Korea.
Newman, of Palo Alto, Calif., was pulled from a plane Oct. 26 while preparing to leave the communist nation after a 10-day tour. Newman, a former finance executive, has a heart condition and his family had been worried about his health since he was detained while trying to leave the country on a tourist visa.
"We are pleased that Mr. Merrill Newman has been allowed to depart the DPRK and re-join his family. We welcome the DPRK's decision to release him," the State Department said in a statement late Friday.
Vice President Joe Biden, who is in Seoul, where he is wrapping up his three-country Asia tour, said that his offer to give Newman a ride was declined.
"The DPRK today released someone they never should have had in the first place, Mr. Newman. I'm told -- we tried to get in contact with him -- he's on his way or in China now. I offered him a ride home on Air Force Two, but as he pointed out, there's a direct flight to San Francisco, so I don't blame him, I'd be on that flight too."
North Korea claimed that Newman was being held for "hostile acts" he had allegedly committed during his trip.
In a video released last weekend by North Korea's state-run media, Newman read an apology for his participation in training and advising a U.S.-led North Korean partisan unit during the Korean War.
"I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes against DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said in a statement that North Korea claimed he had written.
At the time U.S. officials could not confirm his wartime role, but U.S. military records released last week to ABC News confirmed that in 1953 Newman had served in a special forces unit that advised Korean partisans who fought in North Korea behind enemy lines
A former group of South Korean guerrillas say Newman advised them as they fought behind enemy lines during the war. Some members have expressed surprise that Newman would take the risk of visiting North Korea given his role with their group, which is still loathed and remembered in the North, AP reported.
"This positive decision by the DPRK throws into sharper relief the continuing detention of Mr. Kenneth Bae, who has been in DPRK custody for over a year. We call on the DPRK once again to pardon and grant Mr. Bae special amnesty and immediately release him as a humanitarian gesture so that he too can return home to his family. The U.S. Government will continue to work actively on his case," the State Department said in the statement. "
We thank the Government of Sweden for the tireless efforts of the Embassy of Sweden in Pyongyang, which acts as our Protecting Power in the DPRK."
Did North Korea Detain the Wrong US Korean War Vet?
Newman's wife, Lee, told ABC News last month that didn't understand why her husband was being detained, but hoped the situation could be resolved soon so the family can spend the holidays together.
"We just hope whatever that misunderstanding is will be resolved very quickly and that he can return and be at our table for the holidays," Lee Newman told ABC News.
Merrill Newman was traveling with a group out of Beijing on a tour bus through North Korea. On Oct. 26, what was to be Newman's last day in North Korea, he was taken off of a plane set to leave the country and detained by authorities.
"They had checked out of the hotel, gone to the airport, boarded the plane," Jeffrey Newman said. "We understand [they] were five minutes from taking off when the Korean official came aboard, asked to see his passport then asked the stewardess to ask him to leave the plane and he left the plane with apparently no incident or drama and he's been there ever since."
Lee Newman says her husband had in place all necessary and valid travel documents to take the tour.

Rubik's Revived: Classic Cube Gets a Makeover
June 19, 2007 By LINDSAY MAIONE Since 1980, all it took to experience endless hours of mind-boggling puzzle-solving -- and its accompanying headaches -- was twisting and turning a brightly colored, 5.7 cubic centimeter block: the beloved and iconic Rubik's cube.
But today's kids, who may not be satisfied with the original's simple goal -- to get each color on one side of the cube -- can feed their Rubik's rage with a new twist on the classic toy: the electronic Rubik's Revolution. Complete with lights, sounds and numerous puzzles, players can play the updated version by themselves or with friends.
Known for its seemingly impossible solution, which requires fewer than 26 moves to complete, the original Rubik's Cube is estimated to have sold 300,000,000 copies across the globe. In the updated version, instead of twisting and turning, players play timed light games reminiscent of Simon, another 1980s classic.
In an effort to keep up with an increasingly high-tech gaming industry and the children who are raised on it, it is no surprise that classic toys are getting updates. The kids' classic CandyLand has been transformed into a computer game, while 1980s standbys like Cabbage Patch Kids and transformers have also been given face-lifts.
"There is an overall trend toward trying to modernize classic toys," said Eric Levin, executive vice president of Techno Source, the company that helped launch this new cube. "Kids today grow up in an electronic world from their time in cribs."
Anita Frazier, a toy industry analyst at the NPD Group, agreed.
"Reviving classic brands is a tried-and-true tradition in the toy industry. It really depends upon the nature of the individual toy and the underlying play pattern," Frazier wrote in an e-mail. "For this product, I believe the technological updates do add an extra element of fun to what is already a very engaging toy and well-known and loved brand."
Despite the Revolution's features, the gadget, which is aimed primarily at children, may leave some fans nostalgic for the original model.
"By itself, it is a nice attractive game, but as a puzzle the Rubik's Revolution cannot be compared to the original Rubik's cube, as this new game involves very little strategy and brain work," said Tom Dennenbroek, a coordinator of the U.S Rubik's Cube Open, which determines finalists for the World Championships, held in Chicago last weekend. "I can only hope it will not disappoint the true Rubik's fans."
Rubik's Revolution debuts in stores this week. More from ABC News
