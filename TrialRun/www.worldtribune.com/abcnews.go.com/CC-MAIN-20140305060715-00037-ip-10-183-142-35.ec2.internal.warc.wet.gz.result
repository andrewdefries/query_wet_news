Doctors Debate 'Delayed Vaccine' Schedule
Dec. 29, 2008 By AUDREY GRAYSONABC News Medical Unit Dr. William Schaffner is no stranger to parents' fears over vaccines. But at a talk next month at his grandchildren's school, to a room packed with parents, Schaffner said his job will be less about convincing parents that their kids need vaccines -- and more about convincing them that they need to adhere to the recommended schedule.
"I've already heard there's going to be an overflow crowd at my talk," said Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases and chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
Indeed, fears among some parents that the current regimen of infant vaccinations involves too many vaccines too soon have reinvigorated the debate over childhood vaccine safety.
In October 2007, Dr. Robert Sears, a pediatrician in Capistrano Beach, Calif., published "The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for Your Child." Included in Sears' book, which sold more than 40,000 copies, was an alternative vaccine schedule that would allow parents to delay -- and in some cases completely avoid -- many vaccines for their children.
On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is issuing its updated childhood vaccination schedule, along with an article that deconstructs Sears' popular "delayed vaccine" schedule.
In accordance with recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the new AAP vaccination guidelines include a recommended flu shot for all children 6 months of age and older, as well as a two-dose schedule for the rotavirus vaccine.
But more importantly, the article released alongside the guidelines outlines the safety and efficacy issues associated with following an alternative vaccine schedule, such as that proposed by Sears.
Dr. Paul Offit, lead author of the report and chief of infectious diseases at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, wrote in his article that "at the heart of the problem with Sears' schedules is the fact that, at the very least, they will increase the time during which children are suscepti

Bill Gates, the Hurricane Tamer?
July 13, 2009
By KI MAE HEUSSNER It's the ultimate man vs. nature face-off.
Bill Gates, one of the most powerful men on the planet, appears to be taking on one of Mother Earth's most fearsome forces: the hurricane.
An application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 3, 2008, lists Gates and 12 others as the inventors of a number of methods to control and prevent hurricanes.
"Billions of dollars of destruction and damage is regularly attributable to hurricanes and hurricane-like tropical storms," the document says. "Thus, great interest has arisen in controlling these powerful storms."
The document goes on to describe a process of using fleets of vessels to mix warm water from the surface of the ocean with colder water from greater depths in an effort to cool the surface of the water.
Hurricanes draw their strength from condensation driven by heat. That condensation

'This Week' Transcript: NEC Director Larry Summers
April 4, 2010 Page 14 of 15
As of right now, Barack Obama could not get re-elected, if the
election was held today, based on his approval ratings and based on
history. And so Republicans have all those problems? Democrats have
a bigger set of problems, because they own the levers -- they own the
levers of power in a town in a time when people are fed up with it.
REICH: I don't -- I don't think that's -- that's right. If --
if the Republicans have an alternative, whether it be health care or
the economy, and Americans really understood that there was an
alternative, and the Republicans were articulate about advancing that
alternative, maybe you would be right, but there -- we've -- I don't
remember a Republican Party that was just as consistently negative
about everything.
The public knows that there are deep problems that have to be
faced, and the Republicans are...
(CROSSTALK)
TAPPER: ... you're shaking your head that the Republican Party
-- you don't buy that they are perceived as negative about everything?
WILL: I would set up Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin's
roadmap for tax reform, job growth, and entitlement reform...
TAPPER: You embrace that more than John Boehner does, though...
WILL: Well, that -- that could well be. I'm right, and he's
wrong. But...
