He regularly called police to complain about loud neighbors. He had a license to carry a concealed handgun, and he owned many.Courtesy of Donna RodriguezDeadly Neighbor Feud: Man Shoots Father at 3-Year-Old's PartyThe daytime birthday party for the Danahers' daughter turned into a loud nighttime karaoke party. After calling police multiple times to complain about the noise, Rodriguez confronted his neighbors, capturing it on a 22-minute video. Feeling threatened by the men at the party, he later said, he pulled a gun on Kelly Danaher, seen here.Courtesy of the Harris County Sheriff's OfficeDeadly Neighbor Feud: Man Shoots Father at 3-Year-Old's PartyRodriguez was on the phone with police dispatch and told them, "I have to defend myself." But Harris County police told ABC News "20/20" that none of the men from the party had weapons.Courtesy of the Harris County Sheriff's OfficeDeadly Neighbor Feud: Man Shoots Father at 3-Year-Old's PartyRodriguez repeatedly fired his pistol after one of Danaher's friends approached him. He cited Texas' Stand Your Ground law in his defense. Prosecutors told "20/20" it didn't apply, because Rodriguez himself provoked the argument. Nine neighbors testified about Rodriguez's frequent complaints and his habit of not concealing his handgun. Rodriguez is serving a 40-year sentence for murder.Courtesy of the Harris County Sheriff's Office
