Toyota With 'Stuck' Accelerator Hits 94 MPH, Driver Rescued by California Highway Patrol
March 9, 2010 Page 2 of 2
The 2008 Prius is not covered by a recall for accelerator pedals. Sikes said he had experienced no previous problems with his car, but had received a recall notice for his Prius, presumably for his floor mats, though he did not specify. He said he took the Prius to his local dealer but was turned away. "I gave them my recall notice and they handed it back and said I'm not on the recall list."

391 Percent Interest on Fast Money: Worth It?
June 27, 2008 By ALICE GOMSTYN ABC NEWS Business Unit As his oldest son battled cancer, Richard Gilmore battled lenders who charged him interest rates of 391 percent.
Gilmore, an Ohio social worker, said he fell behind on his bills after struggling with his own medical problems.

ABC News’ Olivia Katrandjian and Alyssa Newcomb report: Former Bee Gee Robin Gibb has woken up from a coma and is showing signs of recovery, according to his doctors.
“Robin is fully conscious, lucid and able to speak to his loved ones. He is breathing on his own, with an oxygen mask. He is on intravenous feeding and antibiotics. He is of course, exhausted, extremely weak and malnourished,” the statement said.
The singer contracted severe pneumonia more thank a week ago and fell into a coma.

Doctors said Gibb’s wife, Dwina, and his sons Robin-John and Spencer and daughter Melissa have been keeping vigil at the pop icon’s bedside, “talking to him and playing his favorite music to him. They have been tireless in their determination never to give up on him.”
“The road ahead for Robin remains uncertain but it is a privilege to look after such an extraordinary human being,” the statement said.
Gibb’s health declined in 2010 when he had emergency surgery to treat a blocked bowel. Further surgery to treat a twisted bowel was also required.
Following the surgery, Gibb was diagnosed with colon cancer, which spread to his liver. Last month he announced that he was in remission from the disease.
The British singer, who was raised in Australia, rose to pop fame as one third of the Bee Gees with his brothers Maurice and Barry.
The trio enjoyed a number of hits during their 45-year career, including “To Love Somebody,” “Night Fever” and “Stayin’ Alive.”
Gibb’s twin brother and band mate, Maurice, died nine years ago at the age of 53 of complications from surgery to fix his twisted intestine.	SHOWS: Good Morning America
