See More Hat dangerous standoff with north korea. Secretary of state john kerry just arrived in south korea after the release of a new intelligence report concluding that north korea could probably put a nuclear bomb on a long-range missile. Martha raddatz tracking all the developments and, martha, all kinds of tough talk from north korea. Still no missile test. Reporter: No missile test yet, george. But this assessment which was supposed to stay classified has raised the temperature further just as the u.S. Was trying to tamp it down and convince north korea not to launch those midrange missiles. Overnight the pentagon scrambled to downplay the assessment buried deep in a classified defense intelligence agency report, which says they believe with moderate confidence that north korea has, quote, nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles." Sources tell abc news, that sentence was accidentally declassified and that the intelligence agencies were caught off guard when congressman doug lambbourne asked about it late thursday. Congressman, with the number of caveats you put on the front end of this, I'm not -- I can't touch that one. Reporter: Early this morning secretary of state john kerry talked about the report. The united states and the republic of korea both want to see a peaceful korean peninsula. Reporter: Those comments follow president obama's rare remarks about the increasingly heated tension with north korea calling on the rogue state to cool down its rhetoric even as the u.S. Is moving warships and sophisticated radar into the region in anticipation of a launch. Now is the time for north korea to end the kind of belidge rent approach that they've been taking and to try to lower temperatures. Reporter: Meanwhile, in north korea, celebration for the upcoming anniversary of the birth of kim ill suggest but next to the masses of flowers in his honor small replicas of north korean missiles. We should make clear that there is no indication that north korea is trying to arm any of the missiles it is expected to launch with nuclear weapons. But this assessment is alarming no matter how much the administration is trying to distance itself from it. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

SXSW 2013: Geeks Come to Austin for South by Southwest
AUSTIN, Texas, March 8, 2013 Page 2 of 2
Share ABC Entertainment News | ABC Business News
Copy
"3-D printing has a keynote spot, which means it's important and that we'll likely see a lot of odd little startups hawking 3-D businesses and wares," Lance Ulanoff, the Editor in Chief of Mashable, told ABC News.
Julie Uhrman, the CEO of Ouya, the company making a $99 open-source gaming console, is also one of the keynotes at the conference.
The One Big App?
Which leads to what many say is the biggest change at the show: the absence of the one big app. At the 2007 festival, a small start-up that let you send 140-characther updates took off -- it was, of course, called Twitter. Then in 2009, Foursquare took off at the geek-testing grounds.
"I think Twitter's launch at SXSW is something that has helped our growth immensely," Forrest said. "That said, it's a double-edge sword. Everyone is expecting something that's going to launch at SXSW that's going to overtake Twitter."
Scoble says that the days of that big app are past for this festival. "It is different than when Twitter or Foursquare got big; it is 45,000 people now, it's hard to get all those people excited about one app," Scoble said.
Still, many of the people in Austin will be testing and playing around with the latest apps and services, many of which might be the next big thing. Scoble said he believes that productivity apps, like TaskBox or Mailbox or Tempo, will make a big splash this year. Ulanoff said he thought messaging apps would continue to be the focus.
But ultimately, Forrest believes, we really won't even know this week if the next big thing will be talked about at SXSW 2013.
"We won't know what the breakout app or item was for a couple of years," he said. "No one could have imagined that Twitter grew to what it was or even what it was two years ago. We are a preview of the future. It's hard to judge what would be hot now."

Murkowski to Vote Yes, But There’s a Catch

ABC News’ Jonathan Karl & Matthew Jaffe report: The push to repeal the military’s controversial Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy potentially received a big boost this afternoon when GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the apparent winner in Alaska as a write-in candidate, announced that she will support the repeal.
“After reviewing the DOD report and the testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee by Defense Secretary Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, I have concluded that it is time to repeal the ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ law,” Murkowski said in a statement.
“We expect all who serve to serve with integrity, but under current law gay and lesbian service members may speak about their sexual orientation only at the risk of being discharged from performing the duties they have trained hard to carry out,” she said. “America is the loser when it denies those who are willing to make the great sacrifices demanded of our men and women in uniform the opportunity do so on grounds of sexual orientation. I agree with Defense Secretary Gates’ view that the military can successfully implement a repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell law provided that proper preparations are implemented.”
But there is a catch. Murkowski, who lost the GOP primary to Tea Party favorite Joe Miller but then came back to defeat him as a write-in candidate in November’s election, said her support is contingent on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid allowing for “an open and fair amendment process.”
“My support for moving the Defense Authorization bill forward, which includes a repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, will depend on whether the majority allows for an open and fair amendment process,” Murkowski said. “This is a weighty, policy-laden bill that normally takes several weeks to debate and amend. If the majority attempts to push it through allowing little or no debate or votes on amendments, I will be inclined to oppose those efforts.”
That “yes, but” could prove to be significant. Murkowski’s concerns echo those of another GOP senator – Susan Collins of Maine – who said she believes the policy should be repealed but is demanding a full amendment process.
The Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote on the annual defense authorization bill – that includes a repeal of the policy – on Wednesday night. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-CT, believes the Republicans are negotiating for a full amendment process in good faith.
“I have never been more confident that we have at least 60 votes for the defense authorization bill with a repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell in it. The only condition is that Republicans want to make sure that there is a fair process for amending the bill,” he told reporters today on Capitol Hill.
Lieberman said he had been meeting today with Collins and Reid to settle on what that “fair process” would ultimately entail.
“If we can’t reach an agreement on it today I will really appeal to Sen. Reid not to bring the defense bill with the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell to a vote because that would be doing it before we know that the votes we have are there. That’s my fear – that we’re not giving the bill and the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell a fighting chance to pass. All it requires is a process agreement because on the substance, I repeat, 60 votes are certain and maybe one or two more.”
But Reid said later that with a packed Senate schedule – including taxes, government funding, and the START treaty with Russia – he is planning to go forward with tonight’s vote.
“I’m considering making it so it’d be possible to offer 15 amendments,” Reid said, noting that 10 of those would come from Republicans. “I don’t know with Christmas staring right down our throats, with START and everything else, why that wouldn’t be reasonable.”
Complicating matters further might be Senate Republicans’ stated refusal earlier this month not to vote for any measures until taxes and funding had been resolved. Reid today denounced the GOP’s move as merely an “artificial roadblock” designed to obstruct Democratic efforts.
“Putting up these artificial roadblocks is foolishness,” Reid said. “What in the world do they accomplish by saying we’re not going to allow you to do the START treaty, the defense authorization bill, until the tax bill is complete and spending is done?”
As of 4pm Wednesday, no agreement on amendments had been reached with Collins and other GOP senators, leaving the fate of the defense bill – and the repeal of the policy on gays – still up in the air.
