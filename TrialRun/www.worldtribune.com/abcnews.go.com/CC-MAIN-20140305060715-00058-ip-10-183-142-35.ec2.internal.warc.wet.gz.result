Miranda Kerr Models Reebok's 'Lingerie' Sneakers
Supermodel Miranda Kerr models in an ad for Reebok's "Skyscape" shoes, which are made from the construction process similar to that of molded foam bras, Reebok says. The tag line for the ad states: "So comfortable you'll forget you have them on." The company says the "pillow-like" design of the sole was inspired by the home furnishings industry, while for the upper "came from the lingerie industry – and specifically, molded foam bras." In a statement, Kerr says, "I'm on the move all day so it's important to have a pair of shoes that balance comfort, style and practicality."

See More And come with us to the top of the "instant index" tonight for the great diana nyad who showed those doubters of her swim through shark-infested waters off cuba. The 64-year-old got in a pool right here in new york, summoned her endurance and swam 48 hours straight, no break. She raised $103,000 to help victims of superstorm sandy. Nyad said it was tougher than she thought, but she repeated her mantra, find a way, find a way. And a happy update tonight on race car driver, dario fran keyty. There he was today, walking out of the hospital in houston. A cast on his leg, a brace on his chest and his two dogs by his side every step of the way. Amazing. This was the scene just four days ago. The indy 500 winner's car crashing into a fence, fracturing his spine and breaking his ankle. And remember this 50 years ago -- fans of the beatles stormed america. An echo of the british envision today. &#9834; paul McCartney, a surprise concert in times square. The 71-year-old gave fans just 30 minutes notice but they descended. And here is maybe the biggest difference in fans back then and fans today. Today they're all armed with their iphones to capture the moment.
