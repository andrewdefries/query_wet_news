The SanDisk Sansa Clip+ is very inexpensive; it has a solid, pocket-friendly design with dedicated volume controls and a built-in belt-clip; it's easy to use; and it offers a plethora of handy features, including a MicroSD card slot, Rhapsody DNA, a voice recorder, an FM tuner, and support for FLAC, Ogg, Audible, and podcasts.
The SanDisk Sansa Clip+ could stand to have better battery life and support for AAC; the monochrome display is small and may be hard for some to read.
The SanDisk Sansa Clip+ is an excellent successor to the line, offering a fitness-friendly design with a built-in belt-clip, a simple interface, solid sound quality, and plenty of handy features--all for an ultralow price. It's an unbeatable value.
