What Are Common Differences In The Way A Person On The Autism Spectrum Might Be Delayed In Understanding Language?
Oct. 23, 2008
Eric Hollander, M.D., Professor and Chairman of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Question: What are common differences in the way a person on the autism spectrum might be delayed in understanding language or find it difficult to take part in conversations?
Answer: There's great variation in terms of the verbal difficulties that autistic individuals have. Certainly, patients with autism have problems with expressive language and receptive language. Clearly, they have problems using language to interact socially. Clearly, there are real difficulties with conversation, and they don't really understand what the role of conversation is. So they may use a very literal response to a question but have difficulty maintaining a conversation. And clearly, patients with autism have difficulties with abstract or symbolic use of language -- so more complex and more abstract concepts, really -- [people with autism] have a real difficulty in terms of understanding that type of language and expressing that type of communication. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 5405729.

Born with HIV, Life at Age 29 Dec. 1, 2013 Page 2 of 2
"It really reflects the progress we've made," said Gallant, who points out that it was only in the last 10-15 years that HIV positive people were allowed to receive any organ transplants at all.
Doctor Uses Partial HIV Virus to Fight Cancer
Gallant also said from a scientific standpoint it's remarkable how far medical options have come for HIV positive patients.
"For me primarily as a treatment focused person it's been incredible to see this from go being a real horrible death sentence to being easier to treat than diabetes or congestive heart failure or arthritis," said Gallant. "If you had to pick one of those three it would be HIV."
