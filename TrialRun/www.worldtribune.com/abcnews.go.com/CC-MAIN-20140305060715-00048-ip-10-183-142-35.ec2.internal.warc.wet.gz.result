See More We turn to french designer, catherine malandrino. How did I do? Yes. She has dressed hollywood a-listers. To robin roberts, today. And now, she's launching a new line that's chic and cheap, called catherine malandrino for design nation. It's exclusively at kohl's. So happy to have catherine with us and a preview of the new line. Bonjour. I'm a giant fan of your clothes. And I love the idea of making them accessible to all. Why kohl's? They pushed me of an affordable line. But for me, it starts somewhere else. It's like, for me, what are you inspired by? And I say, forme, it's paris. Paris is the city where I am born. I'm a woman. And I want to speak to women about paris. And the collection is preferred to as parisian for the american woman. Let's get the first look. A wrap dress with a patent leather trench coat. If a woman needs a little bit of fun. And I see at the same time, it's fun by chic. And it can be weared with a long-sleeve dress like this one, inspired by the print of ceiling. It's very attractive. It's another print with a great story about walking into the streets of paris. It's graphic and beautiful. Give me the price point on these. Just a general price point? I think it's very affordable. Goes from $36 to $136. But at the same time, it's more about style. For me, the price is what is the price. But style is the most important. Let's see another style, then. Come out model number two. I love that. So graphic. This was inspired by one of my favorite promenades in paris. And it has a graphic quality to it. And it can be very parisian with a skirt. Or casual for the weekend with jeans. For me, every woman needs this type of easy but fitting sweater. Thank you so much. Our next look is an adorable t-shirt, paired with a flare trouser. That shirt is so cute. I love it. And the flared trouser, in for fall. And the motorcycle jacket, which comes also in a gorgeous ivory. Which I was eyeing. And a bunch of celebrities. Tell us about this look. Well, I think the jacket, and is every's closet. It's weekend away. Gives a touch of roughneck. At the same time, refined here because it's all quilted. And you can wear it like with not a men's pant. But it is cut for a woman's body. It has a low waist. It has the waist at the waist. And this is what is important as a woman designer. I know women's body. And I make sure that I get emphasize a woman's traits and forgive the weakness. One more look. And this one is really great, too. A pleated jumpsuit. That's the hot color of the season. A gorgeous navy. It's a cobalt navy blue. And it's what a women can find in her wardrobe. It's long sleeves. And it speaks to every type of woman's curve and body. We've seen this on stacy keibler. We know her. It is a great, accessible line, available at kohl's. Catherine malandrino, designed for kohl's. It launches nationwide tomorrow. And catherine, we say mercy beaucoup. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Top 10 Ways Doctors Try to Predict Alzheimer's
Jan. 17, 2010

Alzheimer's disease is a difficult diagnosis to make. The only way to be sure is by doing a postmortem autopsy of the brain, and even then it can remain uncertain.
But while researchers are not certain about the cause of this form of dementia that typically occurs in old age, they have noticed some associations between certain lifestyle factors and biomarkers and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
To get the Alzheimer's Association's list of 10 early warning signs click here. Below are nine factors that, sometimes for unknown reasons, seem to foretell a higher risk.
Age
The risk of dementia increases with age, and so Alzheimer's is more likely to affect someone as they get older. The risk of Alzheimer's increases after age 75 and increases even further after age 80.
Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination
The 3MS exam is a series of questions and answers that helps determine cognitive function and is one of the diagnostic tests a doctor will use for Alzheimer's. "It's more of an interview, really," said Dr. Sam Gandy, chair of the National Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the Alzheimer's Association, noting that the test does not look at executive function or spatial ability. A lower score on this test indicates a higher risk for Alzheimer's.
Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)
The DSST requires more abstract thought than the 3MS and is generally considered a better evaluation test in people with higher levels of cognition. It involves showing patients various digits and symbols and describing them to the examiner in their own words. Lower scores on this metric indicate a higher Alzheimer's risk.

Body Mass Index
Maintaining a healthy body weight is important in preventing Alzheimer's disease, and it seems that works both ways. Having a BMI below 18.5, the lower end of the "healthy" range, is associated with an increased risk for developing the illness.
Alzheimer's Risk Indicators -- APOE Gene
While there is no definite genetic test for Alzheimer's, a specific variant of the APOE gene, e4, has been associated with an increased risk. It remains unclear how they are connected, but the present theory is that it inclines people to accumulate amyloids on the brain.
"There are more people with Alzheimer's because they have [that gene] than with any known genetic risk factor," said Gandy. He said that half of all people with the Alzheimer's have the gene. While people may have zero, one or two copies of the gene, with each copy tripling the risk, Gandy noted that some people with two copies in their 80s and 90s still do not have Alzheimer's, "probably because they have some strong protective genes."
White Matter in Brain on MRI
The presence of white matter on an MRI is associated with increased Alzheimer's risk, although scientists are not entirely sure how the two connect. One theory is that the blood-brain barrier is not entirely intact, owing to the presence of amyloids.
Heart Troubles
Enlarged heart ventricles, thicker carotid artery walls and a past coronary bypass surgery can all signal a higher Alzheimer's risk.
"This is an area of a lot of recent interest," said Gandy. "It's clearly a type risk between ... risk of atherosclerosis and risk of Alzheimer's disease."

London Bombings: Police Arrest One Man and Shoot a Bombing Suspect

UK Police Arrest Man In Anti-Terror Probe
British police said on Friday they had arrested one man near Stockwell underground station in London in connection with Thursday's attempted attacks on the city's transport system. (Reuters)
CCTV Appeal After Police Shoot Bombing Suspect
The Metropolitan Police today released CCTV images of four men they want to question over yesterday's attempted bombing of a bus and three London Underground trains, hours after shooting dead a man at a South London Tube station thought to be connected to the terror attacks. (The Times)

Experts Hail 'Forensic Goldmine' As the search for evidence continues after Thursday's London blasts, experts feel the unexploded devices will provide a wealth of clues. (BBC)
Credibility of Claim of Responsibility Highly Questionable
The credibility of a claim of responsibility for yesterday's attempted attacks on the London transportation system is highly questionable. The statement was signed "Abu Hafs al Masri Brigades" and posted on the Internet on Friday. More than a dozen statements were posted online or sent to newspapers by "Abu Hafs al Masri Brigades" in the past two years, claiming responsibility for the power outages in the U.S. and the U.K., a plane crash in Kenya and the UN bombing in Baghdad among other things. This greatly undermines the credibility of the statements and so far there has been no evidence that this group even exists. (ABC News Investigative Unit)

Pentagon Report Says Iraqi Forces Are Not Yet Able to Defend Country
Iraqi security forces are not yet ready to defend their country on their own against a stubborn insurgency, but most of the nation's army battalions are able to fight with help from U.S. and coalition forces, according to a Pentagon assessment of progress in Iraq released yesterday. (Washington Post)
Iraq Is No Longer Priority News
Two weeks ago, an entire Iraqi family was assassinated whilst asleep. Television screens broadcast images of the murdered family members who appeared to be taking a nap, followed by a picture of their bodies bundled in a truck on their way to be buried. The coverage then ended. (Asharq al Awsat)
