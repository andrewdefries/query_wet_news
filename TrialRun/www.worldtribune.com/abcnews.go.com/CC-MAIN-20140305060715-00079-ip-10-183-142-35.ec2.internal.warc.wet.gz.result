See More This frightening 9/11 report. On this 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, a new report out raising concerns about our vulnerable to potential terrorists. But not at the airports or along the borders. But inside our hospitals. Pierre thomas is here with this new warning. Reporter: Good morning, josh. Authorities have identified no specific plots on this anniversary 9/11, many threats remain, including the potential for radicals to get access to radioactive materials. That's why this new report is so alarming. This report says this 9/11, some hospitals have been lax in securing dangerous materials that the terrorists could use to make a radiological or dirty bomb. The goa has warned before, about hospitals that use radioactive materials to treat cancer patients. We realize how important this material is, it has to be secured. Reporter: The report identifies 1,500 hospitals as having high-risk sources. At one facility, a device containing potentially lethal cicum, was in a door with a combination lock. And the lock was written on the wall. At a third facility, at least 500 people had unescorted access to radiologic material. The nuclear commission challenged the report that overall security at hospitals is lax. The agency said since 9/11, the government has helped medical facilities to develop layers of security for such dangerous materials.

Mitt Romney arrives in Israel looking to reset his foreign trip
July 28, 2012
By Holly Bailey JERUSALEM—Mitt Romney arrived in Israel Saturday looking to reset an overseas trip that was aimed at proving him to be a capable leader on the world stage. But his overseas debut was undermined almost from the very moment he arrived in London, the first stop of his seven-day tour, when he admitted he found the city's Olympic preparations "disconcerting." While Romney later dialed back the assessment, his comments set off a firestorm within the British media-- which labeled him "Mitt the Twit"--and prompted rebukes from key officials, including Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson.
But Romney's rough few days in London could be nothing compared to the task ahead in Israel. While the presumptive Republican nominee will be on somewhat friendlier territory—he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been friends since they worked together at the Boston Consulting Group in 1976—Romney will be navigating far trickier diplomatic territory in what is considered one of the most sensitive foreign policy regions in the world.
His every word and action will face even greater scrutiny than in Great Britain--as Romney faces intense pressure to explain how he would handle the Middle East differently than Obama.
Back home, Romney has repeatedly cast himself as someone who would be a far friendlier ally to Israel. The GOP candidate has repeatedly said he would "do the opposite" of President Barack Obama when it comes to the Middle East—though he hasn't specified exactly what that means in terms of policy.
Speaking before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Reno, Nev., last Tuesday, Romney issued a blistering critique of Obama's handling of Israel, trashing him for his "shabby treatment" of leaders in the region. In one of his harshest slaps to Obama's foreign policy agenda yet, Romney trashed the president for "lecturing Israel's leaders." Israel, Romney said, deserves "better than what they have received from the leader of the free world."
It was a red meat speech to Republicans and supporters of Israel—and no doubt was timed to stir up support for Romney ahead of his visit here. But Romney won't be able to repeat that rhetoric during his two-day visit here. He faces pressure to explain his Middle East policy while at the same time abiding by his rule of not criticizing the president while overseas—a dilemma that could be tricky for the GOP candidate as he seeks to distinguish himself against Obama here.
But Dan Senor, a top foreign policy adviser to Romney, insisted the GOP candidate is coming to Israel to "learn" rather than "contrast" his policies with Obama. He cited the Romney campaign's cooperation with Daniel Shapiro, the U.S. ambassador to Israel who was appointed by Obama, as a sign that former Massachusetts governor wasn't seeking to undermine the president while abroad.
"Our approach is no surprises on either side," Senor said—adding that Romney wasn't unveiling new policy in the region because it could be interpreted as "inherent critique" of the current administration.
"We are working very hard to make sure we don't do that," Senor insisted. "We don't want to criticize the president on foreign soil."

Super Tuesday: The 10-State Voting Extravaganza
By CHRIS GOOD (@c_good) March 7, 2012
ABCNEWS.com
Mitt Romney won six of 10 states up for grabs on Super Tuesday and built up a commanding lead among delegates who will officially select the party's nominee at this summer's Tampa convention.
In total, Romney won 213 delegates Super Tuesday, almost half the total 437 at stake, and more than his competitors combined. If Romney had fallen short of 200, it wouldn't have looked good. If he'd climbed toward 300, his aura of inevitability would have glowed even brighter.
But the former Massachusetts governor is not yet a sure thing for the nomination and he must win 47 percent of the remaining delegates before he can rightly be called the presumptive nominee. The math of the GOP nomination lays groundwork for a delegate fight that could extend well into the summer and even potentially leave Romney without the magic number 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
Romney scored victories in Virginia, Vermont, Ohio, Idaho, Alaska and Massachusetts. Rick Santorum emerged the victor in Oklahoma, North Dakota and Tennessee. And Newt Gingrich won his home state of Georgia. Ron Paul came up empty-handed, again.
Romney now leads all candidates with 397 delegates, according to the latest ABC News estimate. Rick Santorum follows with 175, and Newt Gingrich (104) and Ron Paul (45) trail behind.
There are a total of 2,286 delegates up for grabs during the primary and 721 have already been awarded, about 31 percent.
That leaves 1,565 outstanding delegates and Romney will have to win 747 – 47 percent – to reach 1,144.
The calendar could present Romney with some problems. The next contests focus on the South, where he is thought to be weak against Santorum. And the main delegate prizes are more than a month away. New York holds its primary in late April. Texas is likely to hold its primary in late May. And California Republicans do not vote until June.
With most of the votes already cast, the logistical nightmare of awarding the rest of those 437 delegates could take far longer to unravel.
ABC's Amy Bingham and Z. Byron Wolf contributed to this report.
