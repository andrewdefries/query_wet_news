Ranked number one in the world. He has spent the last few years rebuilding his life and career, as you know, and abc's rob nelson has tiger's comeback story. Tiger woods -- Reporter: With his decisive win at the arnold palmer invitational tiger woods wakes up today as the top ranked golfer in the world for the first time since october 010. Some of the shots I struggled with last year are now strengths. Reporter: And those strengths have now silenced the critics and paved the way for tiger to once again dominate the sport he loves. This is major redemption for tiger woods. I think he's looking at everybody today and saying, you know, I'm back. Reporter: And with redemption comes rewards. Nike has released a twitter and facebook post with tiger's picture and his que, winning takes care of everything. However, the post drew some criticism for glossing over the well documented infidelities that led to tiger's 2010 divorce. Nike will always stick with tiger woods. But other mainstream companies, they haven't come back to tiger. So the key question is will they? Reporter: The golfer's new girlfriend, champion skier lindsey vonn tweet her congratulations electronically ex-claiming number one. Monday's victory was a richly full circle moment for the superstar golfer from his astonishing rise. Oh, wow! Reporter: -- To his scandalous fall. I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. Reporter: And now a triumphant return to former flory. It's been incredible to have all the support and, you know, all the hard work has paid off to get me to this point. Ow, tiger's next challenge comes in two weeks at the masters in augusta. He has won three four times before but not since 2005 so, guys, he has this new ranking and next month we'll see how well he can defend it. Check out this video, one of the most popular on youtube. Tiger woods and arnold palmer in a fight to defend their trophies, part of a new ad for tiger's cga tour video game. I am scared of arnold palmer. Go, arnie. Go, arnie. All right, rob. Very cool video, guys. Thanks, thanks very much. That is good stuff. Hey there, sam. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
