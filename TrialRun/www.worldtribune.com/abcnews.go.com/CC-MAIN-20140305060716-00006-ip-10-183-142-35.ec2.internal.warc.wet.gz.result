American Psychiatric Association Under Fire for New Disorders
Feb 10, 2012

Shyness, grief and eccentricity could suddenly become mental health disorders if the newest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders goes through as planned. But it won't if more than 11,000 petitioners, most of whom are mental health professionals, have their way.
The DSM, the 900-page "bible" of psychiatric symptoms published by the American Psychiatric Association, has been around since 1952. But the fifth and latest edition, scheduled for publication in May 2013, has come under attack for "medicalizing" behaviors that some people would consider normal. The 11,000 petitioners are challenging proposed changes they say would label millions more Americans as mentally ill.
"Our main concern is that they've introduced some new disorders that have never been in a DSM before that we think are not scientifically based," said David Elkins, president of the American Psychological Association's society for humanistic psychology and chairman of the committee behind the petition. "The problem is that millions of people could be diagnosed with a mental disorder when they don't actually have one."
Among the new additions are "mild neurocognitive disorder," a diagnosis that Elkins said makes a disease out of normal aging, and "disruptive mood disregulation disorder," a diagnosis slapped on kids who sulk and throw temper tantrums. "Internet addiction" would also make its debut as a formal diagnosis.
The diagnoses not only label people exhibiting these behaviors as having mental illness but also qualify them for psychiatric drugs that could produce serious side effects, Elkins said.
"We're not opposed to the proper use of psychiatric drugs when there's a real diagnosis and when a child or an adult needs pharmacological intervention," said Elkins. "But we are concerned about the normal kids and elderly people who are going to be diagnosed with these disorders and treated with psychiatric drugs. We think that's very, very dangerous."
Dr. Allen Frances, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University and chairman of the revisions committee for DSM-4, said the new additions would "radically and recklessly" expand the boundaries of psychiatry.
"They're at the boundary of normality," he said. "And these days, most diagnostic decisions are not made by psychiatrists trained to distinguish between the two. Most are made by primary care doctors who see a patient for about seven minutes and write a prescription."
Under the revisions, Frances said he himself would be diagnosed with mild neurocognitive disorder.
"You don't want to be inventing new diagnoses until you're sure they can be accurately made, effectively treated that the treatments are safe," said Frances. "None of these conditions is fulfilled in DSM-5."
Frances said the vetting process for new diagnoses should be just as stringent as it is for new drugs.
"You can't have one professional organization, like the American Psychiatric Association, responsible for something so important," he said.
In a Jan. 9 letter to the American Psychiatric Association and the DSM-5 Task Force, Elkins and other mental health professionals requested that the revisions be reviewed by an independent group of scientists and scholars with no ties to the association. Elkins said the association said such a review was "impossible."
While the American Psychiatric Association did not comment on the petition specifically, it said in a statement that it does consider "input from all sectors of the mental health community a vital part of the process, and all comments are being reviewed by a task force and work group members. ... We are confident that the DSM-5 will be based on the most reliable scientific and clinical data. …"

Depression May Be Contagious, Experts Say
March 28, 2008
By RADHA CHITALEABC Medical Unit Ron and Carol Rossetti had a storybook romance. The two were high school sweethearts, went to prom together and married after college.
"He was like the fun in my life," Carol Rossetti recalled. "But had I known the ride I was going to be in for, I'm not sure I would have signed up for it."
Not too long after they were married, Ron would get into terrible tempers, Carol recalled, or become very depressed. Later on, as his business grew more successful, Ron would spend money lavishly on cars: A Lotus, a Viper, a Porsche, a Hummer.
Ron Rossetti's erratic behavior took a toll on his wife. "I was just really unhappy," Carol said. "I was wanting to find the answer without giving up the marriage."
Carol Rossetti's discontent may be no surprise to many people whose spouses suffer from mood disorders. Ron was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his late 30s, and while the news explained some of his behaviors and brought Carol a measure of relief, his wife Carol was in an unusual and vulnerable position.
Spouses are at high risk for depression when one party has a clinical disorder like depression or bipolar disorder, because they spend a large amount of time with them and are emotionally invested in their well-being.
"Was she depressed? Absolutely," Ron said. "Look what she had for a husband. … Was it a Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde?"
Some studies show that if one spouse is depressed, the other can become depressed, and that up to 40 percent of people whose spouses have bipolar disorder get clinical depression. That's according to Dr. Igor Galynker, director of the Family Center for Bipolar Disorder at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
Natural Born Mimics
"We can mimic other people's facial expressions," Galynker said. "When we mimic other people's facial expressions, we also can adopt the mood that these people are in. It affects us, even on a superficial level."
But such mimicry can go beyond the superficial and become emotional. Studies in which monitors track brain activity while a subject is shown smiling or frowning faces show that the areas associated with happy or sad emotions are active when the subject is presented with the corresponding face.
This ability to tune in to other people's feelings, or empathize, can be useful, but it can also get a person in trouble if they are around someone who has depression.
"If a genetic predisposition exists, and a person is surrounded by people with a behavior, that may give rise to or create an environment that would fertilize that behavior," said Steven Lappen, a writer and frequent public speaker who has bipolar disorder.
Lappen, 58, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 and said his manic and depressive episodes during his 20-year marriage made his wife feel invisible and caused her to withdraw from him, behaving as if she, too, was depressed.
"I was so blocked up, I couldn't respond to her overtures," Lappen said. "Outside of the marriage, she wasn't depressed. She was able to tap into her vitality and vibrancy."
Lappen and his wife eventually divorced, and he later remarried a woman who also has bipolar disorder.
"The good news is that we both have bipolar disorder; the bad news is that we both have bipolar disorder," Lappen said, adding that their implicit understanding of the clinical nature of each other's moods made for a smoother relationship.

Supplements prevent macular degeneration
Oct. 12
By Veronica Holland In the first effective treatment for the most common cause of vision loss in the Western World, a new national study finds the condition can be halted by high doses of vitamins and anti-oxidants.
The form of blindness known as macular degeneration affects some 1.7 million Americans. With no cure and limited treatment options, patients diagnosed with the disease had a grim outlook on the future for their vision.
It starts as a small dot in the center of the field of vision, then slowly spreads outward, eventually taking over the entire central vision. Everyday tasks — driving, reading, even seeing faces — become impossible.
But scientists have now found new hope. The researchers report that a high-dose supplement containing vitamins C and E, beta-carotene and zinc significantly decreases the risk of macular degeneration progressing to blindness. The study appears in the October issue of Archives of Ophthalmology.
Thousands at Risk for Blindness
The benefits of vitamin supplements on eye health have been suggested in the past, but this is the first study to offer support

The South African Police Service said today that Hilton Botha, the lead investigator in the Oscar Pistorius murder case, will be booted from the investigation after this week's bail hearing ends.
The decision comes in light of the revelation that the detective is facing his own attempted murder charges in connection to a 2011 shooting.
"We became aware of the allegations that surfaced yesterday against the investigating officer in the Oscar Pistorius case," Police Chief Reah Piyega said at a news conference today.
Botha and other police officers allegedly fired at passengers in a vehicle two years ago.
"We were aware of the matter, it was in court, it was withdrawn and yesterday we got the decision of the NPA [National Prosecuting Authority]," she said of the prosecutor's decision to pursue the charges against Botha. "At this point in time, it is premature for anyone of us to pre-judge this case."
PHOTOS: Paralympic Champion Charged in Killing Medupe Simasiku, an NPA regional spokesman, told ABC News today that the charges against Botha had been withdrawn because of insufficient evidence while the investigation was ongoing. Simasiku was uncertain why the prosecutor decided to reinstate the charges at this time.
Botha will be allowed to finish the Pistorius bail application that ended its third day in court this afternoon.
Whether Pistorius is granted bail or not, Botha will not be part of the investigation team as it prepares for the Olympic sprinter's trial.
Piyega said Botha is "highly experienced" after 22 years of service and the matter "doesn't take away that experience."
Police Lt. Gen. Vinesh Moonoo is expected to lead the investigation.
As for Pistorius' bail application, a decision is expected Friday.
"With that part over, Botha has done what he was supposed to do and now we are going into the long haul of the investigation," Piyega said.
Botha is scheduled to appear in court in May on seven counts of attempted murder in connection to the October 2011 incident in which he and two other officers allegedly fired shots at a minibus they were attempting to stop. It's unclear whether any of the passengers were injured.
Botha has been outlining details this week at the Olympic runner's bail hearing of his investigation into the Feb. 14 shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp at Pistorius' home in Pretoria, South Africa. Botha was one of the first officers to arrive at the scene, where Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, was found fatally shot three times.
Pistorius, a double-amputee who walks on carbon fiber blades, says he killed his girlfriend accidentally.
Prosecutors say they were unaware of the charges against the detective when he took the stand this week, according to The Associated Press.
"The prosecutors were not aware of those charges [against Botha]," Simasiku of the National Prosecuting Authority said. "We are calling up the information so we can get the details of the case. From there, we can take action and see if we remove him from the investigation or if he stays."
FULL COVERAGE: Oscar Pistorius Case
Botha muddled testimony and eventually admitted Wednesday at Pistorius' bail hearing that the suspect's account of the Valentine's Day shooting did not contradict the police's version of events.
A spokesman for the NPA admitted today that charges pending against Botha were not helpful for the credibility of the prosecution's case, but that the case would hinge on forensic evidence, not the testimony of a police officer.

See More And at the top of our "instant index" tonight, farewell to a comedy legend, jonathan winters, who has died at the age of 87. Revered by a generation of his comic successors, as a mad genius, quirky voices, strange insights. Did you ever undress in front of a dog? A bird some how doesn't count, right? Or a cat. But a dog? They really stare. One of his biggest fans, robin williams, who brought him on the show "mork and mindy." And williams tweeted today, first, he was my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend. He was my comedy buddha. And, some dazzling pictures from around the world tonight, marking the thai new year. A three-day festival. It's been described as a kind of global water fight and even painted elephants get into the act. The water symbolizes the washing away of trouble and a chance to begin again in a new year. And, something happened at the masters golf tournament today that has a lot of people feeling protective. We told you about the 14-year-old golf whiz, tianlang guan, the first player ever at the masters, so young, his mom packed him a lunch, including was penalized for playing too slowly, exceeding the 40-second time limit per shot. It's reportedly the first time anyone's been penalized for that at the masters. The penalty, one stroke. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
