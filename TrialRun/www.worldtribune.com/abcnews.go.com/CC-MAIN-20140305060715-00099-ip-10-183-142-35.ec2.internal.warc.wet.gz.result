Toyota Recall: New Questions About What the Motor Company Knew and When

Toyota's massive recalls of its floor mats and gas pedals may turn into a lot of finger pointing, with new questions about what the motor company knew about the safety problems and when.
While Toyota USA president Jim Lentz told ABC News he was confident that "there are no electronic problems" with Toyota vehicles and that the problem had been completely fixed with the recalls, Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said that in private, Toyota executives told his staff they still don't know what caused all of the runaway cars.
Toyota Recall: More Problems
"I want to know what caused the problem, and I don't just want a statement because their statements seem to be at variance from what they've said publicly and what they've said privately," Waxman, the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said.
While Toyota voiced its confidence that a solution has been found, the ABC News Tip Line continues to hear from Toyota drivers voicing their discontent over how the recalls are being handled and just what is causing the sudden acceleration problem.
Unhappy Toyota drivers are joined by one of America's most renown computer geniuses, Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple. In an exclusive interview with ABC News, he said his Toyota Prius has regularly been taking off on him when he taps his cruise control – with his foot off the gas pedal and floor mats not an issue.

"I think it's more likely software in my case that causes it, and I can't cause it every time and every trip, but I am sure it will happen again," Wozniak said.
Getting through to Toyota to has been a challenge Wozniak said, which he thinks is important even though he says he can correct the problem with his brakes.
"I thought my case has some meaning," Wozniak said. "I would think they would want to hear from me, but it's tough to get through."

Toyota Addresses Wozniack's Case
Toyota spokesman John Hanson said he didn't want to "discount any complaint or problem" when asked about Wozniak's case, but said "there a couple of things here that sound like normal operating procedures."
Hanson said there are a number of scenarios in which a driver can use the cruise control to instruct a Toyota to accelerate fairly quickly and that, in those situations, the brake acts as a default to shut off acceleration.
In one scenario, the driver keeps the cruise control stalk depressed and the car continues to accelerate. "It will not stop until you let go of the stalk," said Hanson.

In another scenario, clicking the stalk will raise the speed in increments. The brake will stop acceleration in both scenarios.
"There are programs within the system that you are telling it to accelerate at a high rate of speed," said Hanson. "I have a feeling it may well be that the vehicle is doing what it is supposed to do."

Pharmaceutical Giant GSK to Pay $3B in Largest-Ever Health Care Fraud Case

Healthcare giant GlaxoSmithKline has agreed to an unprecedented $3 billion settlement with the U.S. government over allegations that the company advertised drugs for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and then used lavish gifts to convince doctors to prescribe the drugs.
The multi-billion dollar settlement is the largest in U.S. history for alleged healthcare fraud, government officials said.
In one instance, a drug was widely promoted to help treat depression even though the FDA had never tested it for such a use, according to the Department of Justice. In another, prosecutors said GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, advertised the drug Paxil for use on children, despite the FDA not having approved antidepressant for anyone under 18. A notice posted on the website for the U.S. National Library of Medicine warned that a small number children to young adults taking Paroxetine -- which is sold under the brand name Paxil -- in clinical studies "became suicidal."
The government also said that GSK failed to report relevant safety information about the popular diabetes treatment Avandia to the FDA and even directly paid medical professionals to push the product on doctors for its alleged benefits for the heart -- even though GSK had no scientific data to back up that claim.
In all, GSK pleaded guilty to three criminal charges for which it will pay $1 billion and another $2 billion will be paid in civil liabilities under the False Claims Act.
GSK is a major manufacturer of prescription medication, vaccines and consumer healthcare products. On its website, the company boasts, "every minute more than 1,100 prescriptions are written for GSK products."
In a 2011 Corporate Responsibility Report, GSK addressed the government's allegations broadly, saying, "Some people are concerned that marketing by pharmaceutical companies may exert undue influence on doctors, that sales representatives may not always give doctors full information about the products they are promoting, or that there may be promotion of medicines for unapproved uses."
GSK goes on in that document to say that the company has "fundamentally changed our procedures for compliance, marketing and selling in the USA to ensure that we operate with high standards of integrity and that we conduct our business openly and transparently."
But critics at the Taxpayers Against Fraud non-profit group said that while recovering the money was a positive step, little is being done on a personal level to combat widespread fraud from the industry's top moneymakers – including putting executives behind bars.
"The bad news is that monetary penalties are not enough to stop rampant fraud... If we want to stop fraud, we need to recover America's stolen billions and we need to make sure that key players lose their jobs, their bank accounts, and their freedom," said Patrick Burns of Taxpayers Against Fraud. "Once the pain is personal and well-timed, the change in conduct in fraudster-companies will be very rapid."

Hand Transplant Recipient: 'This is Like Science Fiction'
March 15, 2010
By GITIKA AHUJA and SUZAN CLARKE
Gitika Ahuja More from Gitika »
Coordinating Producer
Follow @gitgirl
via A Harrisburg, Pa., man who lost both hands in a farming accident is now recovering after having become the first man in U.S. history to get a transplanted arm and forearm.
"You know, this is like science fiction," Chris Pollock, a mechanic and National Guardsman, said on "Good Morning America." "This is, like, 20 years ago ... this was only thought of, and now it's for real."
Pollock was out picking corn late in 2008 when the tractor he was riding malfunctioned. The 41-year-old father of twins stopped to take a look and his coat got caught in the machine's rollers, dragging his left hand in.
Double Hand Transplant
"I reached over with my right hand and tried to pull out my left hand and it got caught. I thought, 'God, just let me die,'" he recalled.
After about 30 minutes, a neighbor heard Pollock's screams and called for help. Pollock was airlifted to Hershey Medical Center.
He was fitted with prosthetic hands, but could not feel his children's touch.
Then, one day, he read an article about the opportunity to receive a hand transplant through the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and he applied.
But finding a perfect match takes more than just the right blood type. The perfect match needed to come from a man with the same sized hands and skin color. On his right side, Pollack needed a new elbow and forearm in addition to a hand.
Eleven Hours in Surgery
For Pollock, though, his breakthrough came only two months after he applied -- a little over a year after his accident.
He got a late-night phone call notifying him that donor hands had been found. The very next morning -- Feb. 5 -- he was in surgery.
Twenty-one surgeons working on four operating tables began the transplant. First, they removed his arm below the right elbow because it was damaged, replacing it with a new elbow and forearm.
Then, on to the left arm, and a complex series of procedures requiring the precise and painstaking connection of bones, tendons, nerves and arteries.
Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, head of the hospital's plastic and reconstructive surgery division, said the medical team experienced a moment of "relief and joy" when blood started flowing for the first time to the transplanted hand and the previously pale tissues turned pink.
Prognosis and Rejection Risk
Pollock is the second person in U.S. history to have had a double hand transplant, and the first to have had an entire forearm replaced.
The first double hand transplant recipient is Jeff Kepner, a Georgia man whose surgery was performed at the UPMC in May 2009.
Like Kepner, Pollock will face intense physical therapy.
The nerves in Pollock's fingertips should regenerate in about six to nine months, and he is expected to have feeling in his hands in two years, Lee said.
Hand transplantation surgery is relatively new in the United States. Patients normally must take three drugs to prevent a rejection of the transplanted limb. Those drugs could increase the possibility of future infection.
Pollock's case is different. He's being treated with an experimental drug regimen known as the Pittsburgh Protocol, which aims to reduce the risk associated with toxic anti-rejection drugs. Under this therapy, Pollock takes only one drug.
Worth the Cost?
The half-million-dollar surgery is controversial. Some wonder whether the cost is justified for a procedure that's not life-saving.
Josh Maloney said he feels it was worth it.

New Lung Cancer, Melanoma Drugs Create Stir
June 6, 2010
By CRYSTAL PHEND and MICHAEL SMITH Two novel anti-cancer therapies -- one that targets a type of lung cancer, the other a drug that trains the body's immune system to fight off melanoma -- created a stir at a major cancer meeting this weekend.
Both therapies are still in their experimental phases; however, physicians at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago were hopeful that the different approaches could change the way doctors treat cancer.
