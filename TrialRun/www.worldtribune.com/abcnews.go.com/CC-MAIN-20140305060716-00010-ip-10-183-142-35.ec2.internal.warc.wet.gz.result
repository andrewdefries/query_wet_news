A one-time millionaire shirley seitz dies suddenly in what we will soon see may not have been sweet home alabama. Her family suspects foul play everywhere they look. And dr. Michael wohlschlaeger -- they're looking at you. He just didn't act right. To me, he just didn't act right. Reporter: You started to have questions about what happened to your mother? Absolutely. I did. Absolutely. Reporter: The suspicions begin with dr. Mike's reaction to their surprise visit back when shirley was sick. Dr. Mike items investigators, in that interview obtained by "20/20," he was happy to see his inlaws. I said, "boy, this is just a real godsend." I said, "shirley's been sick for the last three days, with one of her migraine headaches." And, I said, "here you are, showing up." Reporter: Shirley's mother, myrtle, and brother, junior, say that's not how they remember it. He acted very shocked that we were there, and asked me, "what are you all doing here?" Reporter: The family also wonders about that knocked-over flower pot. When we went in, we noticed a flower pot that was laying in the floor and I asked him about that. Reporter: Mike said it showed shirley might have fallen down the stairs a few days earlier while he was out of town at a doctor's appointment. He tried to tell us that -- that she had fallen, I guess down the stairs and knocked this flower pot over, you know. And that's how her -- what -- what was causing her head to hurt, you know? Reporter: But the family suspects that is a little too convenient. They speculate mike was staging things to back up a phony story that shirley had fallen. Thomas family investigator steve brannan. When the mother comes in on friday, this flower pot that was supposedly knocked over on wednesday is still knocked over. It's not been setup or cleaned up. Reporter: It's still there. Yes. Two days later. If I turn a flower pot over in my house, I pick it up. I don't let it lay there for two days. Reporter: Something else bothers myrtle. Michael's activities on the morning shirley died. On the way to the hospital, myrtle says she told him she noticed a spot, maybe blood, maybe something else, on the bed where shirley had slept. I said, "well, I want to know what that red was on the sheet." He said, "there wasn't nothing red on that sheet." Reporter: Whatever it was, the family says, mike was very quick to clean it up. When you got back to the house, did you go looking for the sheets to see what was on it? They was done gone. He'd done jerked them off the bed and had them in the washing machine to wash. Reporter: Dr. Mike later told police shirley got sick on the bed. Hasty laundering, a knocked over plant. Somebody not acting right. All suspicious, perhaps, but is this grieving family overreaching to blame someone? We don't like something that's ambiguous, none of us really like that. We want to know why something happened. Reporter: Psychologist jennifer hartstein says in cases like these, it may be the grief talking. And very often, while we're grieving, if we're angry, we might want some sort of retaliation, we think that they must have done it, so we're going to retaliate and go after that person. Reporter: But buckle up, because the thomas family is not going to quit. In fact, their hunt for shirley's will leads to a scene straight out of a tv cop show. While dr. Mike is out at a religious meet egg, the family conducts a frantic, clandestine search of the house. Mike could have come back through that door at any minute. So we was having to kinda sneak around and do what we had to do with one eye here and one eye there. Reporter: Sharon and her uncle take the place apart, drawer by drawer. We turned that house upside down. We were digging, digging, taking pictures, trying to find that original will to get in my hand. Reporter: They find the will, in which shirley, even after four years of marriage, left everything to her daughters. Not a dime to her husband. Why didn't she write him in? To the family, the answer becomes clear when they find something else. Shirley's journals. Personal, revealing journals. We found it in, actually, up underneath another drawer in her bedroom. Reporter: And is there anything of interest in the journals about their relationship? How much longer am I going to have to financially support this man? He said he wasn't going to do this to me, he was going to get a job. He's constantly spending my money. Lord, when is he going to get a job? Reporter: Later, when police ask mike about his marriage, he paints a totally different picture. How would you describe your and shirley's relationship? We had an absolutely marvelous relationship. Shirley and I were the epitome of just exactly what a husband and wife were supposed to be. Reporter: But when shirley's daughter reads some of the journal entries to "20/20," well, see what you think about this marvelous relationship. Nothing but take, take, take from this man. No giving. I'm not a wife. I'm a bank. That is taking care of all of his financial needs. Reporter: In fact, seven months after shirley's death, she was still helping to support him officially. Mike collected on her life insurance. 100,000. All the while, the thomas family is desperately searching for a smoking gun. Still ahead, they think they find one. At least, half of one. Not the gun, just the smoke. From a suspicious fire in dr. Mike's past, and a most curious discovery about the first mrs. Wohlschlaeger. Like shirley, she's dearly departed. And wait until you hear how she died. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Book Excerpt: 'Supreme Conflict'

Sandra O'Connor had always imagined that she and John would retire
to Arizona, where they'd kept a home the entire time they'd lived
in Washington. They'd spend more time with their grandchildren, on
the golf course, and traveling around the world. But now it was clear
that wouldn't happen. The face of retirement had changed. John was
battling Alzheimer's, the same debilitating disease that crippled and
killed the president who had nominated O'Connor as an associate justice
two decades earlier. It was her turn to support her husband, before
the disease stole him from her for good.
She hadn't thought she'd be retiring at the end of the term, but it
soon started to sink in."Well, okay,"O'Connor said, deferring to her old
friend and chief. "I'll retire then."
With that exchange, the fading Rehnquist delivered to conservatives
the vote they had craved for more than a decade. Now George W. Bush
and his Republican Congress could begin the realignment of the
Supreme Court. Bush would not be replacing a conservative with a
conservative. He would replace the justice who often dictated the direction
of the Court.
After twenty-four years on the Court, O'Connor had become the
justice to watch. Rehnquist may have occupied the center seat on the
bench, but O'Connor was the justice in the middle. With the Court divided
4-4 on critical issues, her vote often determined the outcome of
important cases. Lawyers crafted their arguments to appeal especially
to her, knowing that as O'Connor went, so went the Court. So broad
was her power that journalists and law professors stopped talking about
the "Rehnquist Court." It was instead, they said, the "O'Connor Court."
Her vote had preserved the constitutional right to an abortion8 and the
use of affirmative action in college admissions.9 Her vote had helped
keep religion out of the public square.10
When O'Connor took her seat in the courtroom that last Monday
in June, she knew that William Rehnquist was staying put. She had reconciled
the events of the past month and, as she looked out on the
packed courtroom, understood that this day would likely be her last on
the bench. She may have been ambivalent about the timing, but "you
make the decision, and you live with it," she explained in an interview.
She had already thought about what she would say in her letter to President
Bush. "I wanted to convey one simple thing: that I'd decided to
retire and that I respected the Court," O'Connor said.
But O'Connor also understood the power of her vote, and she anticipated
the battle that would ensue over her successor. She planned to
tell Bush that she would remain on the bench until the Senate confirmed
her replacement. She wasn't willing to risk leaving the Court
short one member. She didn't want the Court deadlocked. "I did that
deliberately," O'Connor said. "I had no intention of leaving the Court
in a mess. I chose those words deliberately."
Two days after the justices exited the courtroom, leaving Washington
speculating over when Rehnquist would quit, O'Connor called the
Court's marshal, Pamela Talkin, into her office. O'Connor had specific
instructions. She had a letter for President Bush. Talkin should keep it
in the Court's safe until Friday, then deliver it to the White House.
