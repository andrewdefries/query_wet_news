High at the Mountain Post
Nov. 26, 2007
By ROBERT LEWIS and KATE MCCARTHY Editor's Note from Brian Ross: In the third year of a joint project with the nonprofit Carnegie Corporation, six leading graduate school journalism students were again selected to spend the summer working with the ABC News investigative unit.
This year's project involved an examination of whether, as happened in the wake of the Vietnam War, Iraqi war veterans were turning to drugs as a result of the trauma and pain of war.
The U.S. military maintains the percentage of soldiers abusing drugs is extremely small and has not increased as a result of Iraq.
The students' assignment was to get the unofficial side of the story from soldiers, young men of their own generation.
Today's report is the first in a series of five reports.
They were prepared for war. They were prepared to die for their country. But Fort Carson soldiers say they weren't prepared to come home and fight a different battle -- addiction to illegal drugs.
Many of this country's bravest men and women who volunteered to defend America in a time of war have come home wounded -- physically and mentally -- and are turning to illicit drugs as they adjust to normal life, according to soldiers, health experts and advocates.
"Lots of soldiers coming back from Iraq have been using drugs," said Spc. William Swenson, who was deployed to Iraq from Fort Carson. "Right when we got back, there were people using cocaine in the barracks; there were people smoking marijuana at strip clubs; one guy started shooting up," he said.
Fort Carson, just outside Colorado Springs, is home to 17,500 active duty personnel. Four thousand eight hundred service members are currently deployed in the "sand box," as soldiers call Iraq and Afghanistan.
ABC News spoke to more than a dozen soldiers who described widespread abuse of illegal drugs at Fort Carson by service members back from the war.
Spc. Alan Hartmann was a gunner on a Chinook helicopter flying missions from Kuwait into Iraq in 2003. He described the high of flying and the feeling that "nothing can touch you" as well as the terror of being shot at.
After sustaining a neck injury in Iraq, Hartmann returned to Fort Carson. Having regularly ferried the bodies of American soldiers killed in combat -- with the helicopter exhaust blowing warm air and the smell of death through the craft -- Hartmann said he had trouble sleeping. The nightmares were too bad, he said.
To help Hartmann deal with his physical and emotional pain, Army doctors prescribed painkillers and anti-depressants -- two typewritten pages' worth since he's been back. But Hartmann said he didn't like how the drugs made him feel, and instead he turned to self-medication with methamphetamines.
"The nightmares were killing me from being over there. The pain was so bad I didn't want to deal with it. Well, amphetamines is a real quick way to get rid of it," Hartmann said. "I was snorting it, and I was smoking it, and then I was hot railing it, and then I got to the point where I was actually injecting it in my arms," said Hartmann, who eventually checked himself into rehab and is now clean.
"[Soldiers are] coming back, drinking, fighting, putting $1,000 tabs down at a bar and drinking four to five hours, getting to the point where you don't give a crap about anything anymore [or] anybody, don't care if you live or die…the point where you do drugs," Hartmann said. "[Drugs] have been in Fort Carson like crazy."

It's "your voice, your vote." And jake tapper is on the trail in the battleground ohio. Good morning, jake. Reporter: Good morning, george. That's right. Both candidates head here to this critical buckeye state, with new polls indicating that mitt romney got a big bounce out of the debate last week. With one poll showing him in the lead. It appears to be a new day and a new race. Just a few weeks ago, some in the media and politics were preparing mitt romney's campaign obituary. But he not only has a new lease on life, he has momentum. A new poll from the pew research center, shows romney pulling ahead of the president in likely voters. A bounce he was hoping for after the debate on last wednesday. One he noted at a rally in virginia. That was a good debate. Reporter: Earlier in the day, romney sought to capitalize on the tumult in the muslim world. We must make clear through actions, not just actions, that their nuclear pursuit won't be tolerated. Reporter: President obama was shaking the money tree in california. And attending a fund-raising concert in san francisco. We're going to go forward, not backwards. That's why I'm running for a second term as president of the united states. Reporter: Vice president joe biden is holed up in a delaware hotel room, engaged in debate prep. While paul ryan got some unexpected debate prep of his own with a reporter from our flint, michigan, affiliate. The best thing to help prevent violent crime in the inner cities is to bring opportunities in the inner cities. To help teach people good discipline, good character. That is civil society. That's what charities and civic groups and churches do, to help one another. And do that by cutting taxes? With a big tax cut? Those are yours, not mine. Thank you very much, sir. Yeah. That was strange. Reporter: The obama campaign, also seeking to mock mitt romney for his pledge to eliminate funding for pbs, by portraying him in a tv ad, by personally going after big bird. The ad says, mitt romney taking on our enemies, no matter where they nest. George? We've not seen the end of that. Jake, thank you very much. Diane sawyer and I will have live coverage of the next big debate. The v.P. Candidates go at it this thursday, at 9:00 eastern, 6:00 pacific. Let's go to josh and the This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

African Countries Appeal to ICC
NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 28, 2009
Page 2 of 2
Central African Republic: Jean-Pierre Bemba Goma, a Congolese rebel leader, stands accused of directing his militia to commit mass rape, torture and murder. Goma is in custody at The Hague and is awaiting trial.
Darfur, Sudan: Two warrants of arrest have been issued for Janjaweed leaders, largely responsible for driving the genocide in the country right now. But the big controversy is about whether the court will issue a warrant for Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir. The lead prosecutor has presented a case to court calling for Bashir to be charged with genocide. Both rebel leaders are still at large and Bashir has stated that Sudan does not recognize the court and will not be subject to its findings.
Sudan isn't the only country that doesn't recognize the court. Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Russia and the United States also have not ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, finalized in 2002, making a country a "state party," meaning it must abide by the court's rules and regulations. Many countries, including the United States, have cited a fear that their soldiers could be tried in an international court of which they have no jurisdiction. Indeed, only 108 countries have signed on and, out of those, 30 are African.
No Means of Enforcement for the Court
The U.N. and Western governments have threatened to have Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe charged under the international court, as well as politicians found responsible for Kenya's post-election violence last year, causing critics of the court to conclude that it is unfairly targeting Africans. Robla says its African countries that continue to call on the court.
"Of the Congo, Uganda, CAR [Central African Republican], Sudan, the first three have asked the court to investigate, and the U.N. Security Council asked the ICC [International Criminal Court] to investigate Sudan," the court's Robla said. "More than one-third of the countries that ratified the ICC are African countries, so it stands to reason that many of those being prosecuted would be African."
The international court, Robla said, is a "purely judiciary institution." It has no army or body to reinforce its warrants and relies on the "cooperation of the states, and all states parties must participate."
Sometimes, as is the case of Uganda's Kony, a country signed on and asked the court to investigate crimes committed but still has not handed over suspects.
His prosecution at The Hague has become one of the sticking points in the Ugandan government's working out a peace agreement with the resistance army. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has said that the government will not turn over Kony and his army to the court, causing an outcry from human rights organizations.
Robla said that governments are not supposed to use the international court for negotiation. Once the court has been asked to get involved and an investigation is opened, state parties are expected to follow the treaty.
"The country cannot negotiate anything," Robla said. "They will follow the normal judicial process once a case is in play."
The court is governed by its legislative body, the Assembly of States Parties, which consists of one representative from each state party. The member states contribute what they can toward the court's finances. As of September, the ICC's staff consisted of more than 500 people from more than 80 states.
But it's unclear how serious the repercussions will be for countries that have signed the treaty but do not abide by its regulations.
The Congolese government has so far shown the most willingness to utilize the court but, without any form of enforcement and limited funding, it remains to be seen how many other perpetrators of some of the world's worst crimes will face justice. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 6749677.

The Note: Political S.A.T.
January 6, 2006
Page 7 of 7
The GOP's new state party chair in New York says he's ask Rudy Giuliani to re-challenge Sen. Hillary Clinton next year, ace Michael Slackman reports. LINK "Mr. Giuliani, through his spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said he 'is not even thinking about politics right now,' and at least one person close to him said he had no desire to be one of 100 senators."
Justin Sayfie has the latest polls from Florida on his supersite: LINK 2008:
The Boston Globe's Rick Klein looks at the plan unveiled yesterday by Sen. John Kerry to provide health care coverage for all children, funded by rolling back tax cuts and encouraging states to expand their Medicaid and children's health programs. Kerry sat down for a Globe interview and talked about how his campaign experiences are fueling his desire to be a "national voice" on issues. LINK "Kerry said the bill fulfills a pledge he made on the campaign trail, where he vowed to make such legislation the first bill he'd file as president. He has signed up 300,000 'citizen cosponsors,' recruited via his campaign e-mail list. Kerry said he is planning to 'gin up energy' for his bill through speeches around the country."
"He will have his work cut out for him: The bill is not expected to get a warm reception in the Republican-led Senate, although Kerry promised to reach across the aisle to Republicans members who favor expanded healthcare."
Interesting comments from Sen. John McCain as well, who knows a thing or two about increased influence in the Senate after a presidential campaign.
Tealeaves from:
Biden: LINK Santorum: LINK Media:
The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz reports that another syndicated columnist, Maggie Gallagher, was on the Bush Administration payroll in 2002, getting $21,500 from the Department of Health and Human Services to defend the President's plan to encourage marriage, writing a magazine piece for the HHS official in charge of the initiative, writing brochures and briefing officials. LINK "'Did I violate journalistic ethics by not disclosing it?' Gallagher said yesterday. 'I don't know. You tell me.' She said she would have 'been happy to tell anyone who called me' about the contract but that 'frankly, it never occurred to me' to disclose it."
Iraq:
The Washington Post's Karl Vick and Robin Wright turn in a great story detailing the work by the "midwives of democracy" -- the organizations in Baghdad to train Iraqi candidates, parties, and election workers.
LINK The Washington Post's Doug Struck spends some time with two Sunni leaders who weighed the dangers and upsides of running in the elections -- one who decided to run, and one who decided to sit it out. LINK The Boston Globe's Thanassis Cambanis looks at some of the female candidates on the Iraqi ballot. LINK Paul Richter of the Los Angeles Times writes that the $92 million push to register Iraqi ex-pats to vote has "fallen far short of expectations, drawing fewer than 10% of the eligible voters in the United States and fewer than 25% worldwide, officials said Tuesday." LINK What's a big issue in the Iraqi election: electricity and water. Iraqis tell the New York Times they won't vote for slates that sponsor those ministers and officials. LINK Just another word for nothing left to lose:
There's a must-read front-page Wall Street Journal story on Bush Administration policy toward Russia.

The ugly truth about Peyton Manning
November 26, 2013
Page 5 of 7
That night Caldwell got in his playbook. The next day he ran the right route, and a curious thing happened: Manning came back to him. Yes, he's more demanding now than ever, but he's also more patient. Maybe it's the injury. Maybe it's being a parent to twin toddlers. Maybe it's age. He admits that he takes time to soak in the little things now. Like the plane rides. After the Broncos beat the Cowboys in that wild 51-48 October shootout, Manning sat on the team charter as it took off and looked around. No players were wearing seat belts. Everybody was on a cellphone. He laughed to himself. "When the pilot says we can't take off when those things are happening," Manning says now, "he's lying, because we do it."
Maybe Manning has more patience with his teammates because his teammates need to have more patience with him. He endures moments when something is failing him physically, and he needs everyone to stay with him until he figures it out. That's exactly what happened in the third quarter against the Colts on Oct. 20. Down 33-14, Manning didn't just seem mortal: He looked old. Two sprained ankles and an unrelenting pass rush left him unable to set his feet. Passes that Manning once hit in his sleep were now fluttering to slow deaths.
But he kept throwing. In the fourth quarter, he took a snap and was immediately under siege. Manning dodged the rush, scooting up the pocket, and saw Thomas on a post route, double-teamed but slightly open. He launched himself into the throw, putting his body into it as if starting a somersault. The ball flopped and fluttered, but damn if it didn't land in Thomas' hands for a touchdown.
Manning had cracked his biological code, and he put up 16 points in the final 13 minutes before losing 39-33. After the game, he was asked why the ball wasn't spinning out of his hands. "I throw a lot of wobbly passes," he said, shaking his head. He stared off for a second, and the pain of the past few years seemed to flash through his mind. Then he added, "I throw a lot of wobbly touchdowns too."
THE BEAUTY IS still there, of course. You just have to look harder to find it. Gase says his favorite play from this year was a 22-yard out route against the Raiders in Week 3 that to an outsider seemed unremarkable. But as Gase tells it, that throw was representative of everything Manning has lost and gained. Manning dropped back and saw that his primary target, tight end Julius Thomas, was covered. So was Welker, his second read. The pocket was collapsing, and Manning's only option -- Demaryius Thomas on a deep out route -- was across the field and double-covered.
Manning's game has always been based on timing as much as on audibles. For years, the only way to defend him was to force him off script. Now Manning works harder on his timing because, as he says, "you might not be able to arm that throw" the way he used to. Only he knows the impossible precision this entails. It means lining up at linebacker after practice to teach a rookie how to get open. But it also means perfecting his internal timing, not allowing himself to be tricked into believing that his body can do something that it now can't. Manning has to hit the open receiver not only within the shrinking window of the secondary but also within the shrinking window of his physical capabilities.

Spy Fears: Twitter Terrorists, Cell Phone Jihadists
OCt. 27, 2008
By NOAH SHACHTMAN Could Twitter become terrorists' newest killer app? A draft Army intelligence report, making its way through spy circles, thinks the miniature messaging software could be used as an effective tool for coordinating militant attacks.
For years, American analysts have been concerned that militants would take advantage of commercial hardware and software to help plan and carry out their strikes. Everything from online games to remote-controlled toys to social network sites to garage door openers has been fingered as possible tools for mayhem.
This recent presentation -- put together on the Army's 304th Military Intelligence Battalion and found on the Federation of the American Scientists website -- focuses on some of the newer applications for mobile phones: digital maps, GPS locators, photo swappers, and Twitter mash-ups of it all.
The report is roughly divided into two halves. The first is based mostly on chatter from Al-Qaeda-affiliated online forums. One Islamic extremist site discusses, for example, the benefits of "using a mobile phone camera to monitor the enemy and its mechanisms." Another focuses on the benefits of the Nokia 6210 Navigator, and how its GPS utilities could be used for "marksmanship, border crossings, and in concealment of supplies."
Such software could allow jihadists to pick their way across multiple routes, identifying terrain features as they go. A third extremist forum recommends the installation of voice-modification software to conceal one's identity when making calls. Excerpts from a fourth site show cell phone wallpapers that wannabe jihadists can use to express their affinity for radicalism:
Then the presentation launches into an even-more theoretical discussion of how militants might pair some of these mobile applications with Twitter, to magnify their impact. After all, "Twitter was recently used as a countersurveillance, command and control, and movement tool by activists at the Republican National Convention," the report notes."The activists would Tweet each other and their Twitter pages to add information on what was happening with Law Enforcement near real time."
Terrorists haven't done anything similar, the Army report concedes - although it does note that there are "multiple pro and anti Hezbollah Tweets." Instead, the presentation lays out three possible scenarios in which Twitter could become a militant's friend:
Scenario 1: Terrorist operative "A" uses Twitter with… a cell phone camera/video function to send back messages, and to receive messages, from the rest of his [group]... Other members of his [group] receive near real time updates (similar to the movement updates that were sent by activists at the RNC) on how, where, and the number of troops that are moving in order to conduct an ambush.
Scenario 2: Terrorist operative "A" has a mobile phone for Tweet messaging and for taking images. Operative "A" also has a separate mobile phone that is actually an explosive device and/or a suicide vest for remote detonation. Terrorist operative "B" has the detonator and a mobile to view "A's" Tweets and images. This may allow "B" to select the precise moment of remote detonation based on near real time movement and imagery that is being sent by "A."

The choices expectant parents make today go beyond finding out the gender of their baby. They span beyond deciding whether to find out if their child, still in the womb, may potentially have a genetic disorder. Today, many parents must decide whether to store their baby's umbilical cord blood so it will be available to heal their child if at any point in the child's lifetime he or she becomes sick. Close ABC News The advertisements for cord blood banking appear in magazines, online, in doctor's offices and on Facebook. Oftentimes, an expression of interest by expectant parents prompts an invitation by private banking companies to a fancy informational dinner.
ABC News sent a producer with a hidden camera to one of these informational dinners to investigate what expectant parents are being told -- and found the benefits of cord blood banking may not always match the pitch.
"You have this one-time opportunity," said Dr. Albert Sassoon, an obstetrician-gynecologist in New York, at an informational dinner for expecting parents. "If I was doing this today, I would definitely bank the cord blood, no doubt about it."
Many consider it science on the cutting edge: Umbilical cord blood rich in stem cells obtained once a child is born can be used to treat rare conditions and holds promise for the future. And with 4 million births in the U.S. each year, private cord blood banking is a growing industry.
In their marketing material, many banking firms tout an impressive list of 70 to 80 diseases that purportedly are treated by stem cell transplants. However, research has not yet proven that stem cells from cord blood work for all of the listed conditions.
"Presently, we treat over 80 life threatening diseases," said Sassoon, who was present at the dinner sponsored by ViaCord, a private cord blood banking firm. "With the amount of diseases that we treat today, by the time you reach the age of 70, you'll have approximately the chance of receiving a stem cell transplant -- one in 200, one in 217."
But many experts told ABC News that the chance that anyone will benefit by their own cord blood -- which is what is stored in private cord banking -- is much lower than that.
"The chance of somebody needing their own cord blood is extremely, extremely low," said Dr. Machi Scaradavou, pediatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and medical director of the New York Blood Center's national cord blood program.
In fact, Sassoon's statistics provided to a crowd of many parents-to-be comes from a 2008 study published in Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation that included a variety of stem cell transplants from bone marrow and other sources. The stem cell transplants were not specific to cord blood.
Leukemia is among many of the diseases listed in ViaCord's marketing material as treatable by stem cell transplants. But for children with leukemia, their cord blood stem cells may carry the same disease, so its use is not recommended. However, doctors may be able to use their siblings stem cells if the parents have stored them in a private bank. If not, many doctors turn to public banks for treatment.
Cord blood can be banked two ways -- in public banks for use by anyone in need whose tissue type is a match, and in private banks where it is only available to the family of the child who donated. The likelihood of matching cord blood for most children in a public bank is greater than 90 percent.
Sassoon told ABC News he found the 90 percent match rate through public banks "surprising."
Like some doctors who facilitate private cord blood banking, Sassoon said he is compensated each time he collects his patient's cord blood. When asked if he disclosed his monetary affiliation with ViaCord, Sassoon responded, "If they ask me -- yes."
