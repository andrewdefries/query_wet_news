Ice 'n' Roll: Live Earth From Antarctica
July 3, 2007 By MCCARTON ACKERMAN Hoping to become a cool band? Play a show in Antarctica.
Nunatak, a band made up of five British scientists stationed at the British Antarctic Survey's Rothera research station, is doing just that. The band will play the first live concert on the continent Saturday. The performance is part of Al Gore's Live Earth festival, which will feature all-day concerts on every continent in order to raise awareness of climate change.
Stationed at Rothera, the band's members are researching climate change and evolutional biology on the Antarctic peninsula.
"I can't believe we've been invited to do this," said Matt Balmer, lead singer of Nunatak. "It's a fantastic opportunity to encourage people of the world to deal with climate change."
Although each band member has played in a band before, the group has only been rehearsing since October. Saturday will be Nunatak's first live performance.
Influences Range Far and Wide
Nunatak's musical influences range from local bands to novelty acts.
"Our biggest influence is the mighty Hoff," said a laughing Tris Thorne, Nunatak's fiddler, referring to "Baywatch" star and musician and David Hasselhoff. "We listen to Britney Spears a lot, too," he added.
Thorne also listens to acts from his native Scotland like Chris Dreever.
Because scientific research takes priority over the musical sort at Rothera, simply finding time to rehearse has been Nunatak's biggest challenge.
"We're a lot busier than most people expect, but we make the time," said Thorne. "Thursdays are our music nights. We often play together on the weekends too."
A Concert for Up to 2 Billion
Because of Antarctica's freezing temperatures and prolonged darkness in winter, Nunatak's audience will consist of the other 17 scientists stationed in the area. However, the concert will be viewed by up to 2 billion people via film, television and the Internet.
The Live Earth performance will be the biggest show that any member of Nunatak has played.
"It's as many people as you can squeeze into a British pub," said Thorne of his past gigs. "Having 2 billion people potentially watch your show is so staggering that we can't even comprehend it."
In order to film the show, a new HD movie camera and sound gear were shipped to the station. A high-speed data link will transmit the performance to the United Kingdom.
The brutal Antarctic conditions have also affected Nunatak's instruments. Thorne admitted that his fiddle was coming apart at the seams.
"It's not due to the cold as much as the extreme dryness of the snow and the environment," said Thorne. "The hardest part is fingers in the metal strings."
All the band's members will be performing with gloves on in order to avoid losing finger mobility.
Performing Is Welcome Change From Routine
For lead singer Balmer, the performance provides a welcome change from the routine at the Rothera research station.
"We expected to spend our Antarctic winter here at Rothera quietly getting on with our work and maybe performing at the occasional Saturday night party," said Balmer. "We could never have imagined taking part in a global concert!"
Despite the wave of publicity Nunatak has received over the Antarctic concert, it has no plans to pursue a music career.
"By the time we all get back home [in 2008 or 2009], all of the publicity from this will be forgotten," said Thorne. "We're not celebrities, and just like playing music for its own sake."

Beyond 'Sexting': Teenagers Sending Racy Videos
March 22, 2011
By MARY PFLUM, and MICHAEL MILBERGER via The proliferation of cell phones equipped with video cameras has made shooting and sending x-rated videos easier than ever for teenagers ABC News
Share ABC Entertainment News | ABC Business News

The proliferation of cell phones equipped with video cameras has made shooting and sending x-rated videos easier than ever for teenagers.
The world of "sexting" -- sending sexually explicit text messages -- amongst teens that was once limited to raunchy words and pictures is increasingly moving into the video domain -- with devastating consequences.
Not a day goes by for 25 year-old Melanie Paradis that she doesn't think about the events that unfolded during her junior year of high school after an explicit video she made for a high school crush earned her the nickname "porn star."
"He asked me to send him a video using my webcam of me taking my clothes off." Paradis said. "I did it after school one day and sent it to him."
The video of then 15-year-old Paradis stripping was shared by her crush with another student, then uploaded to the school's computer lab; where it was viewed by other students, teachers, and even the principal.
"I'd be at the movie theater on the weekend with friends and someone would shout 'porn star' at me," Paradis said. "There was no escaping that I had made a mistake. I'd made a really big mistake."
According to a 2008 study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, more than 1 in 5 teenage girls have sent or posted nude images of themselves.
"It's a definite crisis," said Sgt. Thomas Rich, an Internet safety expert. "It's just modern day truth or dare with technology involved.
The pressure to send illicit material is also beginning at shockingly young ages.
"I was asked for a picture in seventh grade," said 15-year-old High School student Jessica Pereira.
The explicit images are often made between teens in a relationship, but after the teens break-up the videos can go viral.
When 16-year-old Julia Kirouac broke up with her boyfriend last fall, she shared the sexy images she says he pressured her into making for him.
"I felt like my whole entire world just, like, crumbled," Julia said. "I didn't—understand anything because the person that I had trusted the most did that to me."
The humiliation sent Julia into a deep depression and in early February Julia downed a bottle of pills -- in an attempt to kill herself.
She spent a week in the hospital recovering. Now, she says, she's learned a powerful lesson she wants to share with other teens.
"I just want them to know that they don't have to do anything that they don't want do," Julia said fighting back tears. " And if they think that they need to send pictures or videos, whatever it is, to a guy that they're dating or that they like, it's not worth it at all.

Dining Out on a Calorie Budget Nearly Impossible, Studies Find
May 14, 2013
Page 2 of 2
Share ABC Entertainment News | ABC Business News
Copy
"This also highlights the variability of calorie counts for similar meals," Urban said.
David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said preparing your own meals at home slashes calorie consumption by 20 percent to 35 percent, simply because there is a tendency to serve yourself smaller portion sizes than are put before you when eating out.
"The amount of food and calories you consume per dollar is one of the major reasons you go back to that place," he said. "Restaurants know they are competing with other restaurants based on value, so they tend to be less concerned with your health and more concerned that you come back."
When faced with larger portion sizes, Levitsky said you almost always eat more because your brain is programmed to eat what's in front of you. It's a primal behavior based on bygone days when most humans weren't sure when they'd be eating again.
If eating at home isn't an option, Levitsky recommended ordering half portions, splitting an entree or asking the server to doggie bag half of your meal before it hits your plate.
Scourboutakos said it's also wise to skimp on sauces, dressings and extras and to surf the web for calorie counts when they are available before heading out to eat. Page

6 Strategies for Coping With FAA Furlough Delays By GENEVIEVE SHAW BROWN (@gsbrownabc) April 23, 2013
Scott Olson/Getty Images
The sequester cuts and resulting Federal Aviation Administration employee furloughs have resulted in flight delays. The FAA said today air traffic controllers will space planes farther apart so they can manage traffic with current staff, which will lead to delays at airports including DFW, Las Vegas and LAX. The FAA also expects delays at Newark and LaGuardia because of weather and winds.
On Monday, more than 1,200 flight delays were attributed to staff reductions.
With no immediate end in sight and the busy summer travel season fast approaching, what's a traveler to do? Cancel a planned trip? Not book a summer vacation out of fear of the "flightpacolpyse?"
Such drastic measures aren't in order, at least not yet. But if your flight is affected by furloughs, here are five coping strategies to make the wait as painless as possible.
Check your airport, then your flight status.
You can use the FAA web site to see if your airport -- departing and arriving -- is experiencing widespread delays on arriving or departing flights. Web sites like FlightAware.com also offer cancellations by airport that are easy to track.
Even if your airport appears to be operating normally, be sure to check your individual flight status on your carrier's web site. Says on time? Be a little wary if you noticed that your departure or arrival airport is experiencing lots of delays or cancellations. This is your clue to check back, and then check back again. The information about your specific flight may not be updated yet on your carrier's site.Make sure your carrier has accurate contact information
You know the email address you gave when you purchased your flight? You know, the junk one you hardly ever check and haven't looked at since the day you purchased the flight? Check it. Or better yet, if you haven't yet boooked a flight, give the airline an email address you actually use when you do book. Why? As long as the furloughs last, the airlines will be reaching out to consumers with gusto to let them know about potential delays. It's in the best interest of the airlines to get the public riled up about this situation and gain public support, so they will be more eager than usual to share flight delay information with travelers.Use Twitter
Follow your carrier on Twitter and feel free to tweet your airline about your flight, even if all looks to be well. You might be surprised at how quickly you get a response -- almost always faster than the 800 number. And again, the airlines will be more transparent than usual about delays and will likely be communicating widespread delay information over social media.Buy an airline lounge day pass
Already at the airport? if your flight's not taking off for quite some time, consider buying a day pass to your carrier's lounge if they have one at your airport. Typically if an airline has a hub at that airport, they also have a lounge. A one-day pass to American Airlines' Admirals Lounge is $50. A day pass to Delta's SkyClub is also $50. It may cost even less if you have an airline-branded credit card. Airline lounges typically have refreshments and light snacks, free wi-fi, plenty of comfortable seating and personal travel services. Some even have free alcoholic beverages.
If you're a frequent traveler with several flights in the coming months, consider Priority Pass: a membership gives you access to 600 airport lounges. There are three price plans ranging from $99 to $399 annually.Explore the airport.
Airports are more interesting than you might think. Both San Francisco Airport and Burlington International in Burlington, Vt. offer yoga rooms. Phoenix Sky Harbor, Denver International, Philadelphia International and San Francisco all offer rotating art exhibits. Or, think about squeezing in a workout: Most airport hotels sell day passes for about $20 (the Hilton Gym at Chicago O'Hare is known to be quite nice).Get GateGuru
Download the GateGuru app to your smart phone (free) to see every amenity -- from restaurants to shops to services -- at your departure or arrival airport gate.
