Abby Sunderland Quits Around-the-World Sail Record Attempt
April 25, 2010
Page 2 of 2
"'We experienced a total of 4 knockdowns," Watson wrote in her blog. "The second was the most severe, with the mast being pushed 180 degrees in to the water. Actually pushed isn't the right word, it would be more accurate to say that Ella's Pink Lady [Watson's yacht] was picked up, thrown down a wave, then forced under a mountain of breaking water and violently turned upside down."
Abby Sunderland's Brother Zac Succeeded His Attempt With Under-18 Around-the-World Sailing Title
Just last summer, Sunderland's older brother Zac set the world record for being the first person under age 18 to circumnavigate the globe solo in a sailboat.
His record was eclipsed a few months later by British teenager Mike Perham, who is a few months his junior.

Jeffrey Kofman
Jeffrey Kofman is a London-based correspondent for ABC News. He reports from around the globe on stories in the U.K. and Europe as well as the Middle East and Africa for ABC News broadcasts including "World News with Diane Sawyer," "Nightline" and "Good Morning America." Prior to his assignment overseas, Kofman spent 10 years based in Miami for ABC News as correspondent for Florida, the Caribbean and Latin America.
Since his move to London in January 2010, Kofman has covered the Arab revolutions in North Africa from Tunisia and Libya. He has reported from South Africa, Kenya, Norway, Sweden and Italy and the Indian Ocean.
While based in Miami, August 2010, Kofman was the first foreign news correspondent on the scene when 33 trapped miners were found alive in a collapsed mine in Chile's northern desert. He reported the dramatic story from the scene during the seven-week long rescue effort and he was there when the miners were brought to the surface.
Kofman also played a key role in ABC's coverage of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, scoring numerous exclusives for the network, including the first television interview with BP CEO Tony Hayward.
Since joining ABC News in January 2001, Kofman has traveled extensively to report on developing stories and political events in Florida and the southeast and more than 20 countries in the Western Hemisphere. He has traveled through some of the most remote regions of South and Central America. He has also covered every major hurricane of the last decade and reported from New Orleans before, during and after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2006.
During his decade in Miami, Kofman developed a specialty in original reporting from the Americas, including stories on obscure but important cancer research in Ecuador and environmental reports from Patagonia, the Galapagos, the Andes and the Amazon. Kofman rode horses into the mountains of Mexico to look at the wintering grounds of millions of Monarch Butterflies; he lived with researchers on a remote island in Southern Chile as they studied a previously unknown population of blue whales, the largest mammals on earth; he flew with American environmentalist/millionaire Doug Tompkins through Patagonia for a look at the world's largest private park Tompkins has assembled to preserve the wilderness in that region; and he biked down "The World's Most Dangerous Road" which has become Bolivia's biggest tourist attraction.
Kofman spent a month in Haiti in early 2004 when guerillas took control of much of the country. He was the only network television journalist to interview President Jean Bertrand Aristide before the President fled the country. He has traveled throughout Colombia, covering U.S. efforts to wipe out the drug trade in that country. In September 2003 he flew aboard President Alvaro Uribe's government jet as the President made a surprise visit to a small city under guerilla control, and in May 2002 he traveled into the Andes aboard Colombian military helicopters, following the anti-narcotic police as they blew up cocaine production labs deep in the jungle.
Kofman also covered Cuba extensively, reporting on the impact of the long stalemate between the U.S. and that country. He was also among the first group of journalists reporting from the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba when Afghan prisoners of war were first brought there in January 2002.

Bumpy-Faced, Cow-Sized Reptile Roamed the Ancient Desert - ABC News
X	New Animal's Skull Discovered in Niger
By JON M. CHANG (@JonMChang) Jun 25, 2013, 2:50 PM
The face of the Bunostegos looks like it was made by a kindergartner who went wild with a tub of Play-Doh. Flaps of skin are stretched below its chin, hanging like stalactites. Hard knobs decorate its nose and forehead. As weird-looking as the animal is, it was able to live in the harsh deserts of the ancient supercontinent, Pangea.
Archaeologists at the University of Washington discovered three Bunostegos skulls in the rocks of the Moradi Formation in Niger. The details behind these fossilized remains will be published in next month's
