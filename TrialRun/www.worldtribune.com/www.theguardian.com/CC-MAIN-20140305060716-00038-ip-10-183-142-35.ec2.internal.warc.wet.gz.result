Poland v England – as it happened | John Ashdown | Football | theguardian.com Preamble: We've all been there. You're off out, perhaps to the shops, perhaps to the disco, perhaps round to your nan's for tea, and your favourite (or, if things are a little desperate, only) trousers are on the washing line. And they're sodden. It was a misjudgment, a miscalculation, a straight-up-and-down honest-to-goodness mistake. And now you're in trouble. The hairdryer does nothing more than warming up the wet. The radiator isn't much better. Going outside and wanging them around your head is as tiring as it is ineffective.Spare a thought then for the groundsmen and women in Warsaw, charged with drying out a pitch that less than 24 hours ago was as wet as a sardine's bikini. You sense that what they'll do is exactly what anyone would do when faced with the above trouser (or underpants) issue: leave it as long as you can then going for it anyway knowing that it's going to be damp and unpleasant at first but hoping that you'll get used to it after a while.Roofwatch: The sun is now out in Warsaw so the roof, predictably, is now closed and will remain so during the game. It was finally closed late last night, then reopened this morning in an attempt to help the pitch dry, before being closed for good early this afternoon. There's no rain forecast for today, but you imagine that even if record temperatures were predicted they'd keep the damn thing shut. You know, just in case.Those at the ground seem hopeful that there'll be no further delays to proceedings – pictures from the national stadium this afternoon suggest the surface is playable, but likely to cut up like a Sunday league bog as the game goes on. So, hopefully, we'll be able to concentrate on a match that has gathered a little more edge to it following events in Ukraine last night. There's Montenegrin cat amongst the Polish and England pigeons – Branko Brnovic's team, having already suggested it a home draw against the Poles, proved in no uncertain terms that they're genuine contenders for qualification with their victory in Kiev. Two draws against England in Euro 2012 qualifying indicate they'll be no pushover for Roy Hodgson's side either. Defeat today for the visitors will leave things a little too tight for comfort at the top of Group H.Team news: Roy Hodgson said as the rain came down last night that he'd stick with the same XI for the rearranged game, so barring some sneaky last-minute changes we're expecting his side to line up like this: Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Lescott, Cole; Milner, Gerrard, Carrick, Cleverley; Rooney, Defoe.2.34pm: Following Roofgate (a nickname that feels slightly cumbersome given it features two parts of a house - it's like calling something Doorwindow or Chimneyshelf) the ad men at Vauxhall have worked fast – they'll be running roof-based ads on the advertising hoardings during the game.
