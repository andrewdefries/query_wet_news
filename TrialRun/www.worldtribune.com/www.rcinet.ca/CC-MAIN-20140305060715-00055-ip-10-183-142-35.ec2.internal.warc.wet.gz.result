World's top scientists urge protection of Northern Canada's George River caribou herd	A panel of leading scientists is calling for the protection of calving grounds used by one of Canada's (and the world's) most significant caribou herds. They've signed a letter of support for an Inuit Land Use Plan for northern Labrador that proposes to make the 14,000 km2 George River herd's calving grounds off limits to industrial development.

Tecumseh, the native leader who helped define Canada in the War of 1812	It's been called the forgotten war, the "great mistake", and the birth of Canada. But the horrific warfare and battles waged during the War of 1812 were part of the distinct evolution of Canada. We talk to historian James Laxer, the author of 'Tecumseh and Brock: The War of 1812', who tells us the outcome would have been very different had the natives, led by Tecumseh, not joined the fight.
