T. Rex Blood?: Expert Q&A
Posted 07.31.07
NOVA scienceNOW
On July 31, 2007, Mary Schweitzer answered questions about her discovery of what may be T. rex blood vessels and red blood cells, the implications of that and similar discoveries, and other matters dinosaurian and paleontological.

Dr. Mary Schweitzer is a paleontologist and Associate Professor in the Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University. She is also Associate Curator in Vertebrate Paleontology at the university's Museum of Natural Sciences, and research associate with the Montana State Museum of the Rockies. Schweitzer and her team made headlines in 2005, when they reported, in the journal Science, on their discovery of soft tissues still surviving within the 68 million-year-old bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex. Schweitzer's research interests include determining how and why molecular remnants, including soft tissues, may have survived; what biogeochemical conditions may have led to that survival; and how such molecular remnants have been chemically modified from the living state. She is also interested in the evolution of physiological and reproductive strategies in dinosaurs and their bird descendants, including the question of whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded, cold-blooded, or something in between. Schweitzer earned her Ph.D. in Biology from Montana State University in 1995.
Q: It looks as if the T. rex may have nucleated red cells. Is this so?
Judith Chester, Santa Fe, New Mexico
Mary Schweitzer: Well, there are small, red structures within the vessels that look like nucleated red cells. So on the surface, this is a case of "if it looks like a duck…." But after 70 million years, just because something looks familiar doesn't mean that that is what it is. The fossil record can mimic many things, so without doing the chemistry to show that there are similarities to blood cells at the molecular level, I do not make any claims that they are cells.
However, we do know that, except for mammals, all living vertebrates (fish, frogs, birds, and reptiles) have nucleated red blood cells in circulation. Mammals are unique in having their blood cells "spit out" the nucleus before they go into circulation (unless there is a disease). So, because dinosaurs' closest relatives are crocodiles and birds, it makes sense that their blood cells would have been nucleated.
Q: What do you intend to do with the possible T. rex blood vessels if you find out that they contain T. rex DNA? Recie, Alorton, Illinois
Schweitzer: I don't work with DNA, and my lab is not equipped to work with ancient DNA—it is not as stringent as it needs to be. So I won't be doing anything with them. However, there are a lot of other questions those blood vessels raise, and that is what I am pursuing now. And again, we have not ruled out that the vessels are some kind of artifact. They look and act like vessels, and have all the characteristics, but until the chemistry shows what they are made of, I can't state definitively that they were vessels actually produced by the dinosaur.
Q: I have a stereomicroscope and I love looking at bugs and other stuff with it. What did it feel like when you first realized what you were looking at, I mean the dinosaur tissues? Did it blow your mind? Thanks so much for your answer! Olivia Tyson, Ottoson Middle School, 7th Grade, Arlington, Massachusetts
Schweitzer: Yeah, it did sort of "blow my mind." Still does. I spent about three weeks saying that I couldn't be seeing what it looked like I was seeing. I kept looking at them over and over, and I would get goosebumps. I kept thinking that there had to be some kind of mistake, and I had my technician repeat the studies over and over and over with new chunks of bone to be sure we could get the same results.
Q: The NOVA scienceNOW show and its Web site both state that these are possible blood vessels and possible red blood cells. When will you know if they definitely are, and if they are, what questions about T. rex (and perhaps other extinct animals) might that confirmation help answer? Anonymous
Schweitzer: I can't make any claims for those structures that appear to be like their modern counterparts until the chemistry reveals whether they are molecular remnants of the original structures, even if altered greatly, or if they are some kind of microbial pseudomorph or even some kind of as yet unknown biogeological process unrelated to structures or molecules produced by the dinosaur itself. If, for example, I were able to isolate those round red structures in the vessel and analyze them separately, and if I were to see any signals that are consistent with heme or hemoglobin, I would be much more likely to believe they are related to the dinosaur cells and proteins. For right now, I am assuming they are not.
They are pretty intriguing tho, aren't they?
Q: I found your work as shown on the NOVA scienceNOW program fascinating. Has your discovery of surviving soft tissues in fossilized bones sent other paleontologists scurrying into the field or into museum drawers to test more bones? Did it shake up your field? Lisa Ennis, West Chester, Pennsylvania
Schweitzer: Well, thanks! I find it really interesting too! But, so far as I know, no other dinosaur paleontologists are keen to do this. This is for a lot of reasons, of course, not the least of which is that when they have spent all that time and money exploring for, collecting, transporting, and preparing their dinosaurs, the thought of taking large chunks of the bone and dissolving them just doesn't seem all that—well, productive, I guess. I am not sure whether it "shook up the field" or not, that would be better put to one of my colleagues. I think they are all very appropriately just waiting to see how much information we really can get out of this material first.
Q: What does your discovery of soft tissues still surviving after many millions of years say about our understanding of how fossils become fossils? Will that understanding now have to be greatly revised? Also, did other paleontologists initially doubt your discovery, seeing how radical it was? Keep up the good work! Alexander McCurdy, East Blue Hill, Maine
Schweitzer: I think that our fundamental understanding of the fossilization process may be somewhat in need of revamping—but only if it can be shown that this material is original to the dinosaurs and not some unknown artifact. One thing I am focusing on in our lab is to try to tease out the pathways that would go from what we know of modern tissues and cells to whatever these structures have become. But in reality, although the mechanisms of fossilization have been presented to the public in relatively simplified form, we in the profession have always known that it is more complicated, and that microenvironments within a single bone can vary greatly, resulting in a highly varied preservation. This is just an extension of that, I guess.
As for an acceptance of this work, what needs to be realized is that it is the job of my colleagues to be very skeptical. That is how we keep one another in line! Peer review is crucial to the scientific process, and the skeptical opinion of my colleagues is something I rely on very much. They are probably not as skeptical as me though. I think many of them have a "let's just wait and see" attitude that is very, very appropriate. We have a saying that goes, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof." That is what we are trying to come up with, and the community will wait until then to weigh in fully, I think. They will also wait until the work is repeated by other colleagues. Those are things that are necessary to validate our work.
Thanks for the encouragement. We are still plugging away.
Q: As I recall, you soaked fossils in a mild acid to dissolve the mineral deposits on the inside of the bones. Why does the acid not harm or dissolve the vessels as well, but instead leaves them intact and pliable? Paul Moffett, Indianapolis, Indiana
Schweitzer: That is a good question. The type of acid we use is very commonly applied to remove the mineral from modern bone to reveal the structural proteins that are so intimately linked to the mineral. It is a very mild acid and is more accurately a metal chelator than a true "acid." So it removes the mineral while leaving the protein intact, and it does not harm cell membranes or vessels in modern bone, so we hoped that it would not in our ancient material either.
Q: Why has it taken so long to extract or attempt to extract DNA from this tissue? Has it been tried and failed? I would think intact DNA, even in fragments, would be the most important finding from this soft tissue. Terence Milligan, Edgewater, New Jersey
Schweitzer: Well, it has taken so long because I don't work with ancient DNA and so have not tried to extract DNA. My lab does not meet the requirement of an ancient DNA lab. I am not particularly well-trained in DNA studies, and I personally think that it is much more informative and less risky to begin by demonstrating first ultrastructural preservation and then protein preservation.
Many in the scientific community believe that DNA is too labile to have possibly survived, even in tiny fragments, for 70 million years. It is more generally accepted that some proteins, like collagen, have a higher preservation potential than DNA. And my lab is more suited to do protein studies than to work with ancient DNA. Others are certainly welcome to try to obtain DNA from this or other dinosaurs. It probably won't be me directly, though if we get to the point where funding and equipment allow, I will certainly do the supportive work.
Q: From the first fossils found, what previously made scientists think dinosaurs were or are cold-blooded without having tissue and blood samples? Lydia Lloyd, Modesto, California
Schweitzer: Many of the first dinosaur scientists in fact proposed that these were active beasts, particularly the theropods. Some of the very early work by some artists show theropods in active poses (see for example http://www.glue.umd.edu/~gdouglas/maryland/images/fig8.jpg by Charles Knight). But we also knew from the bones that they were (and are) closely related to reptiles, and modern reptiles are cold-blooded. So it was largely an assumption that dinosaurs shared this trait, and that assumption dictated many of the questions asked about dinosaurs for many decades. This is true in many scientific fields actually.
And, in my own case, I was not looking for vessels and cells in the first dinosaur we found them in, because like every other paleontologist, I did not think there could possibly be any remnant of those structures surviving for that long. The vessels and soft tissues we discovered were actually the happy accident of looking for and trying to describe something else entirely.
Q: I have two pieces of amber with insects in them, and I've always been amazed that it's essentially the actual creatures still there after 20 million years. Did you feel something similar when you found the T. rex soft tissue? Does it bring the dinosaur and its world that much more alive to you than fossil bones can? I think I would get a shiver down my spine. Anonymous
Schweitzer: Yes, I spent about three weeks feeling like every day I was living in a science-fiction movie. It was one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced in my professional career.
Q: Will science be able to use the discovered tissues to recreate living dinosaurs, a la Jurassic Park Glenn Martin, Grand Junction, Colorado
Schweitzer: In my professional opinion, no. There are way too many obstacles beyond getting real dino DNA and proving that it is dinosaurian. That, believe it or not, would probably be the "easy" part, and we have not yet accomplished that. I am not exactly sure why anyone would want to do such a thing! Like the Jeff Goldbloom character in the movie says, "Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should."
If you want more detail, check out a paper I wrote on this subject, available as a pdf at:
http://palaeo-electronica.org/2002_2/editor/r_and_p.pdf
Q: Did the internal structures you found previously show up in X-ray and X-ray tomographs of dinosaur bones? If they did not, why not?
Also, in the Colgate University museum in about 1965, I saw fossilized clamshells that had had their limestone "shells" dissolved away to reveal an internal structure somewhat like a rib cage made of iron pyrites. Why was this apparently known method of dissolving fossilized material to reveal potential inner structures not used on other fossils before now? Hal Lane, Durham, North Carolina
Schweitzer: In answer to your first question, these structures we see are very, very tiny (the cells are about 20 microns), and again, if you don't think that they exist, why would you look? I think that part of the reason they were preserved is because they were covered with a mineral "shell," and therefore there would not be sufficient resolution or density difference to image with a standard X-ray or CT.
Regarding your second question, I sure don't have an answer for that. All we did was apply a very standard methodology that is commonly used to study modern bones. It wasn't really anything special. I think, if you look at the answer to the previous question, it has more to do with expectations. Many of the questions we ask as scientists are built upon accumulated wisdom and assumptions, and so fit within that framework. Sometimes we need to reevaluate those assumptions to make sure they are still valid, and this will happen more often as technology becomes more sensitive.
In addition, I would like to point out that a Polish researcher by the name of Roman Pawlicki was reporting cells similar to what we saw as early as the 1960s. But no one followed up on his work, and some of these findings were not published in widely read journals so may have been overlooked.
Q: Many creationists claim that the Earth is much younger than the evolutionists claim. Is there any possibility that your discoveries should make experts on both sides of the argument reevaluate the methods of established dating used in the field? Carl Baker, Billings, Montana
Schweitzer: Actually, my work doesn't say anything at all about the age of the Earth. As a scientist I can only speak to the data that exist. Having reviewed a great deal of data from many different disciplines, I see no reason at all to doubt the general scientific consensus that the Earth is about five or six billion years old. We deal with testable hypotheses in science, and many of the arguments made for a young Earth are not testable, nor is there any valid data to support a young Earth that stands up to peer review or scientific scrutiny. However, the fields of geology, nuclear physics, astronomy, paleontology, genetics, and evolutionary biology all speak to an ancient Earth. Our discoveries may make people reevaluate the longevity of molecules and the presumed pathways of molecular degradation, but they do not really deal at all with the age of the Earth.
Q: Do you feel dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded, and what evidence supports each case?
Also, there seems to be a great deal of evidence that most dinosaurs could not live in today's gravity without total engineering failure of their body structures. What is your take on this? Robert Therriault, Sunnyvale, California
Schweitzer: In regards to your first question, I think that dinosaurs probably spanned a range of metabolic strategies. Most of the very early and very primitive dinosaurs already possess some characteristics we associate with an elevated metabolic rate. For example, only warm-blooded animals today are obligate bipeds, with upright posture (legs directly under the body, not splayed as in crocodiles, lizards, and turtles). Only warm-blooded animals have sustained and rapid growth or possess insulatory body coverings. All of these traits have been observed in some dinosaurs, although not all are features of all dinosaurs. I think that the evidence supports the idea that dinosaurs had a higher metabolic rate than modern lizards and snakes. Whether any or all dinosaurs attained the metabolic rates possessed by living birds is still open to debate.
We wrote a paper reviewing this evidence, if you want more information. To see an abstract, go to:
http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/88511281/ABSTRACT
Re your second question, I do not know of any evidence in the peer-reviewed literature to support such a claim. The biomechanical evidence that I am familiar with shows that dinosaurs were remarkably efficient and well-adapted to their habitats, lifestyles, and environments. I can think of absolutely no arguments in any field that something so fundamental as the law of gravity has varied even slightly over the course of geological time. I would recommend papers by John Hutchinson and others that address biomechanical issues in dinosaurs.
Having seen many dinosaur fossils in my time, I think it is quite apparent that they were very, very successful, and I have seen no signs at all, even on the microscopic level, for engineering failure. And I think all research in physics supports the "gravitational constant." The principle of uniformitarianism guides historical sciences and states that "the present is the key to the past." Without that understanding, or invoking ever-changing conditions in which certain fundamental rules like gravity do not apply, we cannot ever understand or make statements about events that we can only observe indirectly. The evidence is very strong that by applying principles like the constancy of gravity or the speed of light, past events are understandable and future events predictable, and science moves forward. And these have not yet been disproven, so in my mind there is absolutely no reason to question that dinosaurs would have done just fine in today's gravity.
Q: I have two questions, if that's okay. What work are you up to now? Are you testing the bones of yet more types of animals than were reported on in the show and the NOVA scienceNOW Web article "Inside the Bones" (see Editors' Picks)?
Also, what does it take to do the kind of work you do? What kind of training would someone need to do it? Thanks for your time! Anonymous
Schweitzer: In answer to your first question, yes. We have been seeking to verify the extent of the phenomenon we observed in our "B. rex" by looking at a range of bones from other organisms, from dinosaurs in the Mesozoic to mammals and birds in modern times. See our 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society paper, "Soft Tissue and Cellular Preservation in Vertebrate Skeletal Elements From the Cretaceous to the Present," an abstract of which is available at:
http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/762538t13072m341/
My research goals for the immediate future are to determine if any original remnant molecules comprise the structures that look like blood vessels and cells, and to try to characterize the chemical changes that took place to get from original, functional dinosaur material to what remains of this today. We have so much to learn about preservation, and about these wonderful beasts, I just can't wait.
Regarding your second question, I think it helps if you are slightly crazy. Other than that, I think a firm grounding in chemistry, biology, molecular biology, and evolutionary biology as well as a lot of chemistry. I also think you need to be willing to take chances and to think outside the box. And a deep passion for and love of the subject matter certainly helps in those dark times when nothing goes the way you think it should.

She is Director of the Wildlife and
Contaminants Program, and Senior Program Scientist, at the World Wildlife Fund.
Colborn was a grandmother with a background in pharmacy when she returned to
school and got her Ph.D. at the age of fifty-eight. She is the co-author of
Our Stolen Future (1996) and organizer of a groundbreaking 1991 meeting at the
Wingspread conference center in Wisconsin that brought together scientists to
discuss the evidence on endocrine disruption.
Interview conducted by Doug Hamilton, producer of FRONTLINE's "Fooling With
Nature." Interviewed February 1998.
DH: How concerned are you about the potential health effects of endocrine
disrupters?
TC: I am concerned more now than I was even in the beginning because of the
evidence that is crossing our desk every day. This was a new idea back in
1991. When a group of scientists met to discuss this and to think about it,
they were amazed when they began to realize the implications of their work --
even though they all worked in different disciplines. This is a
multi-disciplinary type of problem that we have to address. And so since 1991
a great deal of science has been deliberately directed towards answering some
of the questions that we were asking back in 1991. And now, seven years later,
there is enough evidence that I would be remiss if I did not say that I think
this is a serious problem. DH: Take me back to that time when the scientists first come together. Are
you referring to the Wingspread conference?
TC: Yes. The reason these people were brought together was because we had
seen such very blatant, open evidence among various wildlife species and
populations concerning this problem of transgenerational exposure. In other
words, the females in the populations were transferring to their offspring,
either in the egg or in the womb, chemicals that appeared to be changing the
course of development of their offspring. Maybe the offspring didn't hatch or
weren't born. Or if they were, oftentimes they didn't make it through to
adulthood. Or were incapable of reproducing. But the obvious thing was that
it was interfering with what is called their "endocrine system". There seemed
to be abnormal or disturbed sexual development, behavioral development,
metabolic problems. Which are all associated with the endocrine system. And
we weren't sure how tightly these, these phenomena were all connected. But it was important to bring people together and discuss this. There were
people there who had never heard the wildlife evidence. There were people
there who had never heard the human evidence: the DES story,
diethylstilbestrol, where the mothers shared that drug with their babies during
their pregnancies, and how it affected the lives of those individuals whose
mothers took that pharmaceutical. It was fascinating to watch what happened as each one of these individuals got
up at this meeting and had a half an hour to present his or her work relative
to the title of the meeting, which was "Chemically-Induced Alterations in
Sexual Development: The Wildlife/Human Connection." And it was, by the second day there was a change in the way the individuals
were behaving at the meeting. There was a bonding also. Tremendous amount of
bonding. And by the third morning, these people were so moved by what they
heard that they decided they wanted to produce what was called a consensus
statement. They wanted the rest of the world to know what they had discovered
that weekend. And they were willing to also provide papers that were going to go through the
peer review process and be published in a book to support their conclusions
from that meeting. So that was a new process that took place. Now consensus
was not reached solely at that meeting. It took us about two and a half months
to get a final document to which everyone signed on.
It was those individuals, then, who went back to their respective institutions
and said, "We had better look at how we have been doing science in the past."
We are seeing the results of those people rethinking how they did things in
various universities and regulatory agencies. Even today, many of us have said that that meeting changed the whole course and
direction of our lives. It really has.
DH: Lou Guillette, who heard about the meeting through one of the
participants, said it was a revelation for him. He had been toiling out in the
field on his own, working with alligators, seeing some things that didn't make
sense to him really... TC: Yes. It is amazing. Because I will walk into a lecture hall, or walk
into an office with a scientist who hasn't heard this before, and they are very
skeptical. That is the way we are supposed to be. Scientists are extremely
skeptical. And they will listen to me and they will ask me some questions and
it is amazing how what should have been a fifteen-minute discussion ends up
about a two-hour discussion before I can get away from these people. Because suddenly people say, "Why didn't we think of this?" And that is the
state we are in now. If we had thought of this, the chemicals that we now are
beginning to understand are affecting us would never have been released into
the environment.
We still need to test chemicals that we produce to see if they cause cancer.
There is no doubt about it. And gross and obvious birth defects. But what we
are talking about now is a change in how an individual can function. This
isn't very obvious. What about a child whose intelligence has been hampered so that it has an IQ
deficit of say, 6.2 IQ points -- which we now have as a result of one study?
Or the children who don't socially integrate as well? How do you put a picture
of that on television? You can't. It is a very difficult message to reach the
public with. This is not a rare event, like cancer. Cancer may hit one in a thousand. One
in every five babies born may have a functional change that is not visible and
would have to be detected by trained technicians, trained laboratory
technicians. But this individual will not be functioning the way that
individual was programmed to function by the genes it inherited from its mother
or father.
DH: You are saying that 20 percent of all children born are affected by
this in some way?
TC: In one study it was demonstrated that up to 20 percent of the children
were affected. DH: Why weren't researchers looking for this earlier? TC: I come from the area of pharmacology, which grew into toxicology when
we began producing a large number of chemicals that we released into the
environment. We wanted to find out what we were doing. And we felt that if we
could use high-dose testing, really high doses, we wouldn't miss the
probability of causing cancer. That was enough. That if we could rule that
out we would certainly be protecting people from everything else as well. So that is where we are. We have done high-dose testing. But what do you do
with a population that is exposed to very, very low doses of something that can
have an effect in the womb at very, very low doses and change the way the
embryo develops?
DH: The general impression out there, by most people, is that there is
quite a bit of testing that goes on before any product gets out on the market.
TC: There have been safety nets. But unfortunately the safety net that we
used as our model was this 70 kilogram adult male. And we did not look at what
happens during embryonic development in the womb or in the egg. And from the
minute the sperm enters the egg, and this individual begins to develop, this
whole process is driven by chemicals called hormones: first hormones that came
with the egg from the mother and then gradually, as the cells split and split
and divide and begin to form an organism, they begin producing some of their
own hormones, but not much. These chemicals are working at a concentration of 1/10th of a trillionth of a
gram. That is all it takes of a hormone to make a change in how an individual
develops in the womb.
Now, we are talking about chemicals that are getting in the human body at parts
per million, parts per billion, parts per trillion. That is a lot higher than
what the system operates within. And we didn't understand this. So testing
chemicals on a fully grown individual who has developed and isn't developing
any more, it would take a much larger dose of something to change the way that
individual functions. Now we have to go back and think about what happens with
humans those first 266 days from conception to birth.
DH: At one point you said it was obvious that these things were all
related to the endocrine system. But it wasn't obvious to an awful lot of
scientists looking at it. What triggered your curiosity here? TC: I was working on a book on the state of the environment of the Great
Lakes. And I pulled all this literature together, lots of papers, you know:
fellows working in Canada, people working in the United States, one out on Lake
Superior, others over, way over on Lake Ontario had done some work, written
their papers, had them published in a number of different journals. None of
them knew what the other was doing. And basically, I sat in a wonderful position where I pulled all this
information together. And looking at it I said, "There is something wrong
here." And the easiest thing for me to do is to use -- thank goodness for
computers -- use a spreadsheet at a computer and start producing these
spreadsheets. And as I plotted those names of the animals in the column on the left-hand
side, this is called the "Y" column, and then on the "X" column I plotted the
effects that were seen in the animals, it began to fall out that there were
serious problems and actually population declines, population crashes, actually
extirpation of some populations. They disappeared in some places. Then there were reproductive effects: all kinds of reproductive problems. The
youngsters didn't hatch, or if they did they didn't look good, birth defects.
And then I broke it down by what were some of the effects that the scientists
were finding. They were finding thyroid problems in all the fish. In all the
birds they looked at around the Great Lakes. This was the Great Lakes that we
were looking at at the time. Behavioral studies began to come out. The birds weren't behaving right:
females and females pairing, the male birds not being territorial and scaring
off predators. There was a condition called "wasting" where the chicks in the eggs can't
absorb the yolk sack to get energy and to produce protein. Or if they did
hatch, wasting could set in after they were born, and suddenly they couldn't
metabolize their food. And they would just waste away and die. Wasting was
quite common in practically every species that was looked at around the Great
Lakes. Well, all of these things fall under the purview of the endocrine system. It
was amazing. And, of course, the most important thing was that cancer is not
the problem. Now, we were thinking cancer was the big bugaboo. This was going
to be the be all and the end all. This was where we would find our answers for
both wildlife and human populations.
What was the problem is that these effects were being seen in the youngsters:
the offspring of the animals, not in the adult animals. And if you started
reading the literature, some excellent work by Jim Ludwig and his dad, it
definitely showed that the recruitment of the birds around the Great Lakes was
very poor. Those birds that hatched there didn't come back. Each year there
were new birds coming into the Great Lakes. Here was a wonderful, wonderful system where birds could come and reproduce:
the bald eagles coming to the shorelines of the Great Lakes, or new birds
coming in from outside the area. After they are there a while, their
youngsters don't survive. And we were seeing fish with both female and male reproductive organs, male
birds with female and male reproductive organs. It was quite fascinating.
These were definitely endocrine effects, but they were being passed from the
mother to the offspring. It didn't seem to affect the adult animals.
So that was the big concern to us. We have not tested our chemicals through a
number of generations to see what would happen. I became very, very cautious. And that was the importance of bringing this
group of individuals together. People I had never met before. The real
skeptics. The real gurus in your field. These were truly experts that met
that first time at Wingspread and discussed this issue. And I had made up my mind then that if they did not see what I thought I was
seeing, because at the time you think you are making it up at times, I would
walk away from it because there was no way I, as an individual, could do
anything about the problem. But instead, through this epiphany that took place that weekend, they saw what
I saw. And they saw more than I did, because they were each knowledgeable, far
more knowledgeable in each one of these various disciplines, to understand the
implications of what it meant. So with their encouragement, then, I kept
moving.
But I think I first realized this probably in early 1988, and I had started
working on this in August of 1987 when I began collecting this literature and
putting it together. And then also in putting it together for that first book,
"Great Lakes, Great Legacy," that told this story, but very simply. And that
is where we first broke with the challenge that cancer is not the deal and that
we have to look for more.
My family will tell you that they thought I was overly concerned. My family is
not involved in the work that I am doing. So the family didn't even understand
what I was feeling. But I had at least 15 or 20 very dear friend wildlife
biologists who were out there who knew this. They had a gut feeling about this
for years. Who really were the ones who encouraged me to keep going. The W. Alton Jones Foundation came through and gave me a three-year grant to
just focus on this particular issue. DH: The potential problem that you are taking on is huge. TC: It is extremely huge. When you think about it, you get a funny feeling
in your stomach when you think about the implications of the very current
research. It is a problem that has forced me, in my position, to say that I
think we need a Manhattan Project. A Manhattan-like project. Our military and
American industry put their heads together, and within two years or so
developed an atom bomb. And then we are going to have to establish an entity
that takes the money and designs the research agenda to address this. We have
got to come up with screens and assays to test chemicals for these effects.
There is not one approved test or assay on the market today or in use to test
chemicals for these effects. Let's look at the problem that we know that hypospadias is occurring in one in
a hundred boys. Hypospadias is a condition where the urethra doesn't come out
of the end of the penis. The more severe form of hypospadias is where the
urethra comes out of the scrotum. This is increasing. This event, that causes
this problem, can only happen between days 56 and 84 during gestation. That is,
56 days after conception up to the 84th day is when that problem is laid down.
Something interfered with the hormonal message at that time to tell that penis
to develop properly with the urethra.
We need to do this research and it needs to be done in a hurry. The science
will be done back in the industry laboratories, in the regulatory laboratories
and on campuses around the country. The information that comes from these
studies will then be reviewed by independent scientists and the results of the
work will be communicated independently without any special interest trying to
change the objective results that are reached in these studies. DH: One of the things that strikes me when you are talking is how much we
still don't know.
TC: This is one of the things that worries me. We are so hell-bent on
finding out what is going on in outer space, and we don't even know how the
embryo develops. We truly don't. We don't know at what concentration the
hormones act in the developing embryo to tell the embryo how to develop. We
are just breaking through on this now. Isn't that ridiculous?
We have got the technology to do this. We haven't paid attention to what is
normal. And the problem is, now it may be too late because there isn't anyone
in the world who doesn't have a large number of what we call "persistent
chemicals" in their body. There isn't a child born today that hasn't been
exposed to these chemicals from the day of conception. So we can't go back and
find out what was back then or what was normal. This is ridiculous.
DH: How different are we today than we were before the chemical age? TC: We don't know. We have no way to compare. There is nothing in the
literature about what is normal sperm production in any wildlife species that
we could find. I think it is time we get a little more introspective now and start looking
internally at how our internal systems work: the environment of our body, the
environment in the womb. I hope we are going to see more of this. We need
this basic research so we can understand better where the chemical can step in
at each little access along the way of development.
DH: You come at this issue from a non-establishment point of view.
TC: That is probably why I got the perspective I did. Because I looked at
it from an entirely different perspective. I looked at endocrinology
differently. I began to look at toxicology. I was not trained in toxicology.
I was trained in pharmacology until I went back to college to get my Ph.D. in
my old age. Only then did I begin to sit in on toxicology courses. There is a reductionism in scientists, in the scientific community. I have
never been a reductionist. I am always thinking about the big picture. My
thesis committee for my Ph.D. will tell you that. They had trouble with me.
DH: Science doesn't encourage that in some ways. There is, I have noticed,
a conservative pressure on scientists to be very narrow in their focus. TC: That is right. This is what your Ph.D. is all about: focusing on
something and proving that you can do this one specific thing, and being the
only expert in that. That is very, very important.
DH: You have obviously come up against a lot of resistance. What is it
like to be at the spearhead of this effort that is challenging so much?
TC: I guess you ignore it. I don't take time to read what is being said
about me. DH: Has the attack been bad?
TC: I think it has been very sophisticated this time. I don't think anyone
wants to stick their neck out like they did with Rachel Carson. I think
industry has been kinder. I think in many instances they'd rather ignore me.
The name of the game is to ignore me and not acknowledge that there is such a
thing as endocrine disruption. Industry definitely has taken a different approach, and are spending their
money on public relations to point out the good work they are doing: how they
are protecting human health, the environment. They are spending more money on
telling you about the wonders of their product. And they are basically
building up within the American public or the television viewing public, and
those who read the press, basically that "We are good companies. We would do
nothing to harm you. We will take care of you." So it is basically a matter of
establishing complacency, I think, within the population. So the role they are playing now more is to obfuscate the issue, to attack the
science that has been coming from scientists that have been getting NSF grants
and NIH grants for years. They are trying to discredit science. And they are
trying to raise questions about whether this is a real phenomenon or not. So,
between that and building their image, I think they have been very
successful.
DH: There is a legitimate role that the skeptic plays in science. TC: That is right. DH: And ultimately, over time, skepticism helps to strengthen the
evidence.
TC: That is right.
DH: We interviewed Steve Safe, who is a skeptic, and he was indignant at a
suggestion that his science was in any way influenced by the funding that he
got from industry. TC: It isn't what Steve is writing. It is what Steve is out saying that is
different. He is one of the best scientists in the country. We have leaned on Steve
Safe's work for years. He is the one who broke out the PCB congeners. He is
the dioxin expert. This guy does good work in his laboratory. He is a
reductionist.
DH: So where is he having a negative effect on this debate?
TC: I don't know whether Steve is having a negative effect or not. He is
getting a lot of people upset, but he is certainly helping us bring this issue
to the forefront. It is allowing us to get this issue before the public. It
has attracted great crowds if we are both on the same speaking agenda. So
people can hear this message. I am almost indebted to Steve Safe. The
controversy is good for this issue. It is what Steve says, not what Steve Safe does in his laboratory. He is a
good scientist. But Steve has made some very derogatory remarks about the book,
"Our Stolen Future". But he has also admitted he has never read it. And he
doesn't intend to. By the way, I gave him a copy of my book as a gift. So
we'll see. He is so funny. That is Steve. I have good times with him. We
laugh a lot. He gave me a Texas A&M nightshirt. I was almost going to wear
it today. I was tempted to put it on for the filming.
DH: What is the effect, then, of having him write in the "Wall Street
Journal" that this is "bunk"? And to write in the "New England Journal of
Medicine" that this is "paparazzi science"? What effect does that have on the
legitimate debate about this issue?
TC: That is the casting the cloud. That is the confusing the public part
of it that is very, very distressing. It really is. DH: Well, the whole politicization of this issue is a fascinating thing.
You don't fit the traditional role of the scientist. It is more than just the
science here. There is a movement, isn't there?
TC: Believe me, I didn't plan this. This is not what I had as a career
goal or how I would spend my retirement years at all. This has just sort of
happened, and people depend upon me. I can tell you there are a whole bunch of
scientists out there who can explain this better, who know it better than I do.
I feel compelled to do something to try to make change. And I guess that is
why I went back to college in my old age. I wanted to get the education so
that I could maybe undo some of the things
that my generation basically foisted on society. DH: All along the way it has led you further from the scientific
laboratory, though.
TC: Oh, yes. Very much so, yes.
DH: And are you comfortable with that? Has there been a cost to you as a
scientist for speaking out, for taking on the advocacy role that you have taken
on?
TC: Oh, certainly. I am walking a very narrow line because of the
traditional thinking that scientists must remain objective. And that is a big
concern, and that may be something we are going to have to overcome if we want
the truth about the things that we are doing. People are going to have to
listen to the scientists and not reduce them in their status because they are
speaking out because they are concerned. And there was an excellent editorial about "Our Stolen Future" in "Science"
magazine in which the authors of that editorial said, "The challenge now is up
to the scientific community. Are they going to come forward and speak out?"
Those people who have done the work and who are speaking out, as far as
endocrine disrupters, have paid a terrible price. Fortunately, those who have
been speaking out have always worked on independent money or soft money from
NSF, NIH or other sources of money from within their universities. They are
speaking from their heart because they are so concerned, and I don't think that
they should be discredited because of that. But that is a line, that is the
tightrope that they walk. It is very difficult.
DH: Who do you blame for making this scientific debate so political, or how
do you explain it? How did that happen?
TC: It is political because it goes to the core of the economy. It goes
right back to international commerce and trade, and we have become dependent
upon these products. You wouldn't be sitting here today because you couldn't have flown in in an
airplane that wasn't using some of these products. This equipment that you are
filming me with, the electronics here, has all been dependent upon these
chemicals that are now being indicted for causing endocrine disrupter type
effects. That is why it is political. You have got the vested interests. Governments don't want to put restrictions
on the manufacturing of the product. The minute you start talking about this,
people immediately think jobs. That is what it boils down to. Net profit. It
is very political. It goes to the core of our economy and our lives. DH: I have heard a statistic that 45 percent of American industries are in
some way affected by this debate.
TC: For some companies, better than 50 percent of their profits are
involved in chlorinated compounds or plastics. DH: But it seems that both sides play the game. You have worked with PR
groups. You have used focus groups to decide how to present your research to
the public. You have done some opposition research. You have played the
political game, too.
TC: Well we had to. We felt that we were dealing with such a serious
problem, it couldn't be just dropped on the public like a bomb. What was the
best way to do it? I don't think it was done for political reasons as much as
it was to get people to pay attention to something like this. Let's face it. When you first hear this, you just don't want to address it.
Because I, as an individual, feel there is nothing I can do about it. How do
you protect yourself from exposure to chemicals like this? That was another
reason for doing focus groups: how do you get this information out without
scaring people? That is the last thing you want to do. So, yes, we did. But nowhere near, believe me, compared to what the industry
people are doing. Our little effort was very, very meager. I know. It was
done on a shoestring.
DH: Is it fair to say that both the environmentalists on one side and
industry on the other side are trying to spin this issue to their advantage?
TC: I have never thought of putting a spin on it. All I have ever done is
said it like it is. The important thing is to tell the truth from the evidence
that you have.
DH: Working with a focus group, you don't see that as spinning?
TC: No. I don't think of that as spinning. See, I thought putting a spin
on something was to try to find the angle that would most confuse people.
Well, that is the "spin" from your perspective. I guess the spin from our perspective then was to find the angle at which
we could not alarm people but get the message out to the public.
DH: The EPA, by mandate, is supposed to be looking out for the public.
TC: Well I have reports from the EPA, that are released by the EPA, that
are counter to what their scientists have found in their laboratory at Research
Triangle Park. They are letting products on the market today that we know are
harmful: that the scientists who research at Triangle Park have told them are
not safe. That is why we need this independent research agenda where the message comes
directly from the scientists who are doing the work and it is interpreted to
the public without the spin from Research Triangle Park to 401 M Street in
Washington, D.C.
This happens in state agencies. We have governors who want to remove fish
advisories in their states and not issue them to the public. Yet the public
health authorities are saying, "These chemicals are affecting our children."
Don't we have a right to try to figure out how to get this message out to the
public, fair and square and honestly? That is why we used the focus groups.
DH: The W. Alton Jones Foundation has an agenda in their giving.
TC: Well they haven't given me any money for five, six years now. Jones put
no money into the book. Absolutely none. There was a lot of money from
Diane's and my pocket. We'll never get that money back, I don't think. We
still owe the publishers. And unless you get into paperbacks, you don't make
much money.
DH: Tell me what is to blame for endocrine disruption? What is causing
this? TC: Well, frankly, where chlorinated chemicals are concerned, we still have
active sources that are out there: material products that we are still using
that have PCBs in them, places where we produce DDT, big dump sites still
sitting out there. But also PCBs are in construction materials, they are in the
lighting equipment, they are blowing around on the air. Believe me, it is
amazing. They have done studies now. It looks like the same amount of PCBs are landing
on the ground here as they are in the arctic. They have sort of become
stabilized or incorporated over the surface of the earth and the atmosphere we
are breathing. PCBs are everywhere. You can't get away from them.
These chemicals have definitely been shown to cause health problems, certainly
with intelligence, behavior, with lactation periods -- the ability to produce
milk and lactate during the normal length of period that you should. And also
we know that a breakdown product of PCB is in everyone's tissue and actually
can prevent normal development, physical development, as well. A recent study, actually published in two separate papers, compared these
chemicals, the PCBs and the dioxins and the furans in average food and also in
fast foods. And basically found the same concentrations. You can't avoid
these chemicals.
DH: You have a statement you make in all of your speeches about our own
personal exposure.
TC: Well, I don't think you will find anybody on the surface of the earth
today that doesn't have at least 500 measurable chemicals in their bodies that
were never in anybody's body before the 1920s: chemicals that we know very
little about.
DH: How do we know this is bad for us?
TC: We didn't think it was, but now we know. Because there are so many and
we know that in some instances in the industrialized world, PCBs are at
concentrations in the human body today where offspring all have neurological
damage. And this has been traced now through age eleven.
At that particular concentration, as these children mature they will show
short-term memory problems and by age eleven they may have as much as a 6.2 IQ
deficit. DH: A lot of people hear of these individual studies, like the effects of
Great Lakes fish on IQ, and they think, "It is not me, because I am not there."
Is that a fair assumption for them to be making?
TC: No. One of the things that came out of the Great Lakes study, and then
corroborated with a study that was done in the Netherlands, is that for someone
to have 1.2 parts per million of PCB in their body is not unusual. You don't
have to be a fish eater to accumulate that amount of PCB in your blood fat.
Now remember, PCBs are in practically every fatty food you eat. They are in
meats. They are in dairy products and cheeses. They are in ice cream, as are
dioxins and DDT. The fattier the food, the higher concentration of these
chemicals. So a lot will depend upon your dietary habits more than where you
are living.
DH: Is there an average PCB exposure in the population?
TC: Well the average is about 1 part per million across the industrialized
world. The farther north you go, the more concentrated it gets. Women living
in the eastern arctic, Inuits up on [Baffin] Island in Canada, basically are
running about 7 parts per million. The western Greenlanders, across the strait
from them, are running 14 parts per million.
Now of course those Greenlanders are really isolated. They don't get any
outside food. They are totally dependent upon narwhal seals, beluga whales,
you know bird eggs, that sort of thing. So their diet definitely has an impact
on them. But you don't have to eat fish to run about 1 part per million in your body.
We are seeing effects at 1.25 parts per million. Which isn't much higher. At
1.25 parts per million in the mother's blood fat, an infant will be born with
measurable neurologic damage. Now the average person in the industrialized
world is walking around with one part per million in his or her blood fat. So
this suggests that a sizeable proportion of our children that are being born
today are being affected.
And this has been corroborated by a study from the Netherlands where they
looked at PCBs and dioxins. And they didn't look at fish eaters particularly
in that study. They just looked at a cross-section of the population. And it appears now that there are other chemicals that behave the same way. We
don't know as much about the movement and the activity of the plastics, but we
found some very unusual plastics that we didn't expect to find in the birds in
the Pacific Ocean, as well. DH: You tend to focus a lot on the child, on the fetus. A lot of this
debate is centered around that. Is that because of what the focus groups found
most effective?
TC: No. Because that is the truth. The whole problem lies during fetal
and embryonic development: the early stages of development. This is what we
discovered in the wildlife. All we are doing is telling the truth. These
chemicals affect the very simplest forms of life, which is the single cells
that begin to split and form individuals, whether it is a bird, a fish, a
horse, a human being. The problem is that our testing up until now has always been on adult animals.
Our message is definitely on what has happened to the prenatal individual or
the individual in the egg, and early life stages, because this is where the
chemicals have their greatest effect. At extremely low concentrations. Not
because focus groups told us to, believe me. This is just the science, the way
the science has fallen. This is transgenerational exposure that we are talking
about.
DH: It is very clear, in talking to a lot of people, that not everyone is
convinced of the science yet. They feel that it is a good hypothesis, but they
are not convinced that we have been able to prove the mechanism yet or firmly
establish this with a degree of scientific proof that they are comfortable
with.
TC: They are probably demanding too much. Remember, the endocrine system
is extremely complex. It is not just sex hormones. It is the thyroid
hormones. It is things called prostaglandins, which I am sure you have heard
of. It involves neurotransmitters. It involves so much -- enzymes -- that to
understand every mechanism of action is going to be impossible. We have enough evidence about the mechanisms of action of some of these
chemicals, and the processes that take place, that we can act now and move now.
There is enough evidence to take certain chemicals off the market today. And
we should. But we are not moving on that. Using what is called the "weight of evidence" approach, it is time to do
something and we should do it soon. So I think that is becoming a weaker
argument as the weight of evidence piles up. And believe me, my filing
cabinets are overflowing with this kind of information.
DH: When we interviewed Steve Safe, he said, "Name the chemical, and show
that it is doing something wrong, and the EPA will act."
TC: Name a chemical and the EPA will act? That is interesting. Look at
the chemicals that EPA has pulled off the market. The only thing they pulled
off was DDT, PCBs and a few pesticides. Nothing else has come off the market.
I could give you a list that would blow you away of chemicals we know are not
safe but they are still being released into the environment. Steve's statement is not correct. And it takes forever for EPA to act. And a
lot of lawsuits. DH: Is there another way at it?
TC: Well, basically that is what the EDSTAC process is addressing. This is
the Endocrine Disrupter Screening and Testing Advisory Committee that was
established by EPA. Eighteen months in effect now. Tedious, with multiple-day
meetings. Looking at how you are going to address the problem of 70,000
chemicals in use today. That is a conservative number, I have been told. How we are going to look at them and decide which ones need to be tested first?
Can they be tested as a class? Are there some that we know so much about now,
already, that we can move on, rather than just screening and testing them for
these effects, but move into the long-term multi-generational studies that we
know we can do? And that process is being worked out now through a
subcommittee called the Priority Setting Workgroup. DH: And the fear of breast cancer, probably more than anything, drove
policy makers to mandate this?
TC: I was amazed, believe me. I don't think any of us working in the field
even knew this was going to happen. DH: It was a big surprise for industry too.
TC: Do you really think it was the breast cancer that drove it? I don't
think it was.
DH: Well, they had a big impact on Al D'Amato, who pushed for this
legislation.
TC: Well maybe they did.
DH: D'Amato was motivated by the breast cancer groups.
TC: I don't know, maybe you're right. Maybe it was breast cancer. That's
fascinating. We wrote into our book that I thought it was a very weak, very
poor connection [between environmental contaminants and breast cancer].
DH: People have said, given that weak connection, maybe Congress should
reconsider the law that they passed mandating screens for endocrine
disrupters.
TC: No, I think Congress did something right. It got the process started.
We have to take advantage of that. You know, basically that's how you move
forward. You take advantage of opportunities when they arrive, which may never
happen again. People are becoming more and more aware of it. You hear it in the mainstream
jargon, on talk radio, you see it in the newspaper, in the everyday magazines
that are going into people's homes, the women's magazines. It's getting
out.
It is a very difficult message to tell people: that maybe your child will be
born and it won't be the same because of the presence of these chemicals in
your body as it would have been if it hadn't been, if these chemicals hadn't
been, around to interfere with and get the wrong messages to the genes in your
body while your baby was developing. And maybe your baby won't live up to its
fullest potential because of this. DH: Some people say Lake Apopka is a really polluted lake, and "the dose
makes the poison".
TC: Well, people said that about the Great Lakes. We're beginning to
realize now that the Great Lakes are about average. We went out to Midway Island where birds that fly the North Pacific Ocean --
they're albatrosses -- feed only on the surface of the ocean. We were amazed
when they did the chemistry on some of the eggs and some of the blood from the
birds and found that these birds have dioxins in them, believe it or not, and
PCBs. And they're at a concentration just at, and slightly below, the level
where we're finding troubled populations of birds around the Great Lakes. DH: What if you're wrong about this? What if it's not endocrine
disruption? What if we figure out it's definitely something different?
TC: Let's put it this way: the amount of money that's going into research
up until now has been peanuts. Are you willing to gamble? That's what it boils
down to.
DH: Are we in the position now that Doctor Snow was in 1854 when he took it
upon himself to disable that disease-ridden water pump?
TC: The only thing is, he cut if off dramatically. No one is suggesting
that we cut this thing off dramatically. We know we can't. We want to work
with industry. We want to compromise. But we have to be very careful how we
compromise, and we could be sucked into this thing if we're not careful. How far will industry go before they clean up their act? And, I think right
now we've seen a perfect example of what can happen with the cigarette
industry. And up until now I've been thoroughly convinced that the
industrialists did not know about the products that they were producing or they
would not have produced them.
DH: What about the parallels between you and Rachel Carson? She writes a
book. She is vilified. You write a book. You are vilified. Do you find
yourself at all thinking about her? Do you draw any strength from her?
TC: I don't compare myself with her at all. She was a beautiful writer.
She didn't have to get a writer to translate her science to the public. She
worked alone. She certainly was a pioneer. No, I think she stands alone. On
her own pedestal. I should not be compared to her.
