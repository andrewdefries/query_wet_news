5Across: How to Deal with Technology Overload

By Mark Glaser
October 8, 2009

There is a common thread in modern life that we are overwhelmed with the technology and media that were supposed to be making us more productive. A LexisNexis survey found that if you add up the time people spend using email, web browsers, instant messaging, and Microsoft Office, it comes to 15.9 hours per day. That’s extraordinary.
So many of us are feeling overwhelmed by technology and are trying to deal with it. I’ve written about my own practice of taking a technology sabbath of one day off a week from my computer. On this episode of 5Across, I convened a roundtable of folks who are either overloaded with technology or helping people deal with that overload. And for true balance, the discussion also touches on the benefits of technology, too. Check it out!
5Across: Technology Overload!

Thank you PBS & Mark for including me in this important & timely conversation. I hope that all who watch these videos find the support they need to think deeply about how their current technology use matches their life’s goals and vision. For those ready to start thinking more deeply about their relationship with technology, I’d suggest starting by striking up a few conversations with family and friends, avoiding judgments and superficial assessments, and really digging down to the level of hearing and respecting each others’ personal needs and values. What DO you think life’s about, and how is technology helping or hindering your human potential?
Warmly,
Leif Hansen

Hey I love this :)
Here’s some of my wee notes in response….
does it affect our relationships? Does it affect our physical health? does it affect the balance in our lives? YES!
These discussions are what help us be AWARE of this, mediate it. These discussions should be more COMMON and more MAINSTREAM.
Expectations HAVE changed – every moment is REQUIRED to provide entertainment otherwise “boredom” is established.
This is a blaringly and disturbingly obvious shift in the generation I am teaching (adolescents), they also have the
“deeper disconnect from ourselves” where they seem unable to see themselves and their own behaviour .
Lack of self discipline is also, therefore (?) extremely common, particularly in this age group.
“really bad at remembering” – is this symptomatic of this technology age?
Is the overload of information available at finger-tips therefore making our brains unable to / not versed at remembering?

Good to see that people care about keeping us entertained as well as informed. That really is the best teaching method.

Get Out There
Our scientists need your help if we are to make gains in the preservation of natural predators. You can affect change in your own backyard or community by following a few simple ideas in your everyday life.
Choose sustainable seafood.
Reduce your impact on populations of top predator fish species by eating from sustainable fish stocks. This generally means eating "lower on the food chain" and supporting fishing techniques that avoid damaging habitat or non-target species. For more information on sustainable fish species, visit Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch Program or Seafood Choice Alliance. Purchase sustainable wood products.
Buying wood products that are grown and harvested using sustainable forestry practices means that quality wildlife habitats are less impacted. This is more positive for the survival of top predators � and all the other critters that use the forest.
For more information on sustainable forestry practices, visit Rainforest Alliance's Smartwood certification program or Forest Stewardship Council - US. Understand farmer and rancher compensation.
Find out about organizations that compensate farmers and ranchers for damage done by large predators.
For more information on famer/rancher compensation and predator protection, visit Grizzly Compensation Trust or The Bailey Wildlife Foundation Wolf Compensation Trust. Locate programs in your neck of the woods.

A Science Odyssey: You Try It: Plate Tectonics
Go directly to Plate Tectonics activity (114K - requires Shockwave) Take a hard-boiled egg and crack its shell. Does the egg remind you of anything? The Earth, perhaps? The egg could be seen as a tiny model of the Earth. The thin shell represents the Earth's crust, divided into plates; within the shell is the firm but slippery mantle. Move the pieces of shell around. Notice how the shell buckles in some places and exposes "mantle" in other places. The same thing happens on Earth, but on Earth, this activity results in the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and new ocean floor.
Even though the theory of continental drift was proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener, the idea of moving continents wasn't generally accepted until the early 1960s. That's when Wegener's theory was resurrected by Harry Hess, Robert Dietz, Fred Vine, and Drummond Matthews. The ensuing theory, known as plate tectonics, has had a major impact on Earth Sciences. It represents a scientific revolution as significant to geology as relativity was to physics.
This activity lets you manipulate tectonic plates. Pull the plates apart and push them together and watch what happens to the Earth.
