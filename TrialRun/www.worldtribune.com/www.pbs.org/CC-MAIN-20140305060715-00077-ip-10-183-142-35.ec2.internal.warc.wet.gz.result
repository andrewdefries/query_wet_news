Jenna Weber | May 16, 2013
I found some fresh apricots at my local market the other day, and couldn’t wait to get home to bake with them!
Just in the past year or so, I’ve fallen in love with these tiny tart stone fruits. If you’ve never tasted a fresh apricot before, I think they taste a lot like peaches…only tarter. They work beautifully in various pies and crumbles, but one of my favorite ways to enjoy them is in this rustic whole wheat crostata.
Think of a crostata as a very rustic pie. It’s perfect for people who aren’t that into baking because the beauty is in the imperfection. No need to crimp a perfect lattice pie crust for this! Just roll out your pastry, add your fruit and voila! Dessert is served.
This whole wheat version is crumbly and delicious. Make sure to let it cool completely on the sheet tray before serving so the pastry can firm up a bit {when it comes out of the oven, it’s soft like a cookie}.
Enjoy on it’s own or with a scoop of vanilla gelato!
Whole Wheat Apricot CrostataServe this whole wheat apricot crostata alone or with a scoop of vanilla gelato! Food blogger Jenna Weber describes flavors of apricots in a full post on the Fresh Tastes blog.Ingredients1 cup whole wheat pastry flour 2 tbsp sugar1 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into small chunks½ tsp salt1 tbsp ice water¼ tsp cinnamonFor filling6 apricots, sliced thin¼ cup sugar2 tbsp flourDirectionsIn a large mixing bowl, blend the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon and butter with your fingertips until all the butter has been incorporated and the mixture resembles cornmeal.

Toss the sliced apricots with the sugar and flour in a large bowl. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out the dough into a 12” circle on a flour surface. Place the sliced apricots in the center of the dough then gently fold the edges of the dough in towards center. Place crostata on your prepared sheet tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden.Let crostata cool for 25 minutes before serving. Yield: 4-6 servings

I started with 4 cups, kept adding water and it is still very thick. Yummy, though.

BUILDING BIG: Databank: Edwards Dam
Edwards Dam
Choose another wonder
Click photo for larger image.
Vital Statistics:
Location: Augusta, Maine, USA
Completion Date: 1837
Reservoir Capacity: 740 million cubic feet
Type: Embankment (timber crib)
Purpose: Hydroelectric power
Misc: removed 1999
Materials: Timber, rock, concrete
Engineer(s): Kennebec Dam Company
On the morning of July 1, 1999, thousands of people lined the banks of the Kennebec River in Augusta, Maine, to watch workers punch a hole in the Edwards Dam. Water began trickling through the hole, and within minutes, a raging torrent gushed past the 915-foot-long, 20-foot-tall wall of rock, log, and concrete. Crowds cheered as the Kennebec River flowed freely past the Edwards Dam out to the Atlantic Ocean for the first time in more than 160 years.
Click photo for larger image. The Edwards Dam was the first hydroelectric dam in the country removed by the federal government for environmental reasons. It was built in 1837 to supply power to mills along the river's banks. But by the mid-1990s, the old dam was generating only 3.5 megawatts of electricity in 1990 -- an amount equal to .1 percent of Maine's annual energy usage. Even before the dam was built, environmentalists argued that a dam on the Kennebec would block salmon, shad, herring, and other fish from reaching their spawning grounds upstream. They were right. Soon after the dam was built, these fish all but disappeared from the river.
For the first time in history, the federal government decided that the damage the Edwards Dam caused far outweighed its benefits. The dam was removed against the owner's will at a cost of $7.3 million.
Here's how this dam stacks up against some of the biggest dams in the world. (reservoir capacity, in cubic feet)
Edwards Dam
740 million cubic feet
Fast Facts:Since the dam was removed in 1999, more than two million alewives, striped bass, shad, sturgeon, and Atlantic salmon have returned to the Kennebec River. Hundreds of logs have been salvaged from the bottom of the dam and are being recycled into furniture, musical instruments, and other products. The removal of the Edwards Dam has sparked the removal of other river-damaging dams across the country. Since the dam's removal, 25 small dams have been removed in the United States. At least 18 more will be removed by the end of 2000.
