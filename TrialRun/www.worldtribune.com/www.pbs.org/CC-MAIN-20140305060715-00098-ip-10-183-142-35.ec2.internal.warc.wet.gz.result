by Amanda Hirsch
John Bracken, director of Journalism and Media Innovation at the Knight Foundation, wants to know what I mean by “collaboration.” We’re chatting by phone about how collaboration fits into Bracken’s vision for news innovation. John Bracken I throw out a modest definition. “Working together,” I say. “Playing nice.” (It’s not a sophisticated characterization, to be [...] more »

Sell-offs hit all the major markets amid downbeat reports from Asia, Europe and the U.S. Federal Reserve. At one point, on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down well over 500 points. It finished with a loss of just under 400.Traders at stock exchanges around the world sat glued to their many screens, as they watched shares skid down, down, down. When the closing bell clanged at the New York Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average had lost 391 points, or 3.5 percent, to finish under 10,734. The Nasdaq gave up 82 points to end at 2,455.Overseas, after Asian stocks fell on weak manufacturing reports, European markets sank to 26-month lows. The German DAX fell almost 5 percent. And the main French index dropped even more, 5.25 percent.A fund manager in France cited multiple causes.JULIEN QUISTREBERT, KBL Richelieu (through translator): First of all, there was last night’s expected decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve. So the lack of surprise created a lack of support on the market. There was also some other negative news, like the downgrading of some American banks’ debt.JUDY WOODRUFF: That Federal Reserve decision will shift $400 billion into long-term securities to lower interest rates and boost investment and spending.Just as important to investors, the Fed underscored long-term risks that may delay a complete recovery for years.In Washington today, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner agreed, the U.S. faces a combination of economic problems.TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER: But the two other clouds still over us are the European crisis and the deep concern you can see across the world and around the country about whether the political system in the United States is up to the challenges we face, not just the near-term challenges of supporting an economy still healing from crisis, but the long-term challenges of growth and competitiveness and fiscal sustainability.JUDY WOODRUFF: But Speaker of the House John Boehner complained the Fed’s new stimulus efforts will make things worse. Republican leaders had warned against any such move.REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R-Ohio speaker of the House: We continue to have concerns with the activities of the Fed, because it appears to us that they’re taking actions because they don’t believe the political system can do what needs to be done.Frankly, I think that’s enabling the political process, rather than forcing the political process to do what it should do, and that’s to deal with our deficit and our debt, which is imperiling jobs and imperiling the future for our kids and grandkids.JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, the president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, acknowledged that kind of fear for the future, even though he doubted that a new downturn is coming.ROBERT ZOELLICK, World Bank: I still think that a double-dip recession for the world’s major economies is unlikely, but my confidence in that belief is being eroded daily by the steady drip of difficult economic news.JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of that difficult economic news continued in Greece, where protesters staged another 24-hour strike against new austerity measures. Greece needs international bailout payments, or it will run out of cash by mid-October and face default.

How A Secure Relationship Can Help Your Depression
Sandy Jardine, LPC, MS

Relationships, Depression, Resilience
We all know that when our primary relationship is
distressed, we feel anxious and depressed. We also know that depression can
have a devastating effect on an intimate relationship. It becomes a vicious
cycle. There have been numerous studies documenting this fact. Relationships
with a depressed partner are often characterized by negative communication,
blame, withdrawal, irritability, loss of motivation, and loss of sexual
interest. It has also been shown that there is a reduction in positive behavior
such as eye contact, smiling, and the ability to enjoy pleasurable activities
together.
Neuroscience has proven we are
wired to connect. It is built into our DNA and our brains. Science, as well as
my 30 years of being a therapist, tells me that everyone wants and needs to love and be loved. Everyone wants to have a deep,
close, secure connection. Unfortunately, many couples struggle with the repetitive patterns that
create a sense of not feeling safe and secure with the one they love most. The
good news is that even in the face of life’s biggest challenges – depression,
poor health,
disability, or financial distress, couples can learn to reach beyond the habitual patterns that
get them stuck in feeling anxious, depressed, disconnected, disrespected and
unloved. Emotionally
Focused Therapy is
a scientifically tested way of helping couples get there.
Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) and Depression – The facts
Two landmark randomized clinical studies utilized Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) in the treatment of couples where one
partner was diagnosed with major depression. Both studies demonstrated that
when the relationship can transform into one that feels safe, secure and
connected, the symptoms of depression are significantly reduced.
Characteristics of a healthy, secure relationship – It’s all about
the attachment.
The science of adult love enables us to understand the major ingredients to
creating and maintaining a loving, respectful, and deep connection through the
lifespan and in the face of life’s deepest challenges. These ingredients are:
• Having the ability to recover emotional balance even
when feeling temporarily stressed or disconnected, without being flooded by
anxiety or anger.
• Your ability to be open and tune in to yourself and your partner.
• Each partner can express their needs to the other.
• Capacity to validate and support each other’s feelings even when you don’t
agree.
• Take in comfort and care when offered. Offer comfort and care when needed.
• Typically do not resort to defensiveness, withdrawal, or anger.
• Conflict is not avoided but dealt with directly.
• Emotional repairs are made when hurt feelings arise.
• The relationship enhances one’s sense of really being yourself. No one feels
like they have to give up themselves for the sake of the relationship.
• When negative events happen, each partner is able to construct a narrative
that integrates these experiences in a positive way into the relationship.
• The bond itself helps each partner become more confident, able to go into the
world, try new things, solve problems and reach personal goals. The bond makes
each partner feel EMPOWERED.
• Having the ability to turn toward and respond to the other with empathy and
caring that consistently renews the loving bonds.
Researchers as well as couples’ therapists have shown that couples engage in a “neural
duet” which helps each one regulate their physiology, mood, and reactions.
Simply said, a secure relationship helps each partner regulate their physical
responses to stress, anxiety and depression. This connection between brains and
hearts allows us to more effectively cope with life and be more resilient in
the face of trauma and loss.
In a recent landmark study,
neuroscientist Dr. Jim Coan proved that just holding the hand of your partner
calms down the brain and makes us less sensitive to physical pain. He
demonstrated that the secure relationship with a partner provides us with a
sense of connection and well-being even in the face of being in pain.When couples have, or can learn to have a secure base, they are no
longer held hostage by the painful patterns that have emerged in the
relationship. This is especially significant where depression is a factor. When
the symptoms of depression such as irritability, low motivation, and
hopelessness can be understood as part of the negative cycle both partners get
caught in, there is room for working together to see the cycle as the enemy not
the other partner.
Like most things in life, a
secure connection exists on a continuum. Not everyone will feel secure all the
time. The key here is to feel like you can turn to your partner and feel
confident that they are there for you. Even when there is a conflict between
you, you can reach for them and they will be accessible, responsive and
emotionally engaged (Johnson, 2008). Further, even in moments of stress,
emotional hurt, and disconnection, each partner can trust themselves and each
other so it is safe to reach and the disconnection can be resolved.
Help for your Relationship
If you have the symptoms of depression, seek help early for the depression and
for your relationship. Don’t let depression destroy the joy in your life, your health and the connection between you and your
partner. We now know specific and reliable ways to help couples repair the
hurts, disappointments and disconnections that occur in close intimate relationships.
You can feel loved, safe and connected again. For help in finding a qualified
