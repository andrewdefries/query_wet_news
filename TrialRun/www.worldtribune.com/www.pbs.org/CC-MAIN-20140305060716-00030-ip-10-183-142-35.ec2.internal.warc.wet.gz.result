Program Three: 'Bridging New York'
Linking the Island of Manhattan to the City and Continent
Eleven major bridges unite New York City together and with the rest of the nation. One engineer was responsible for more than half of them, yet hardly anyone knows his name.
Othmar Ammann came to America as a graduate of Swiss engineering schools and learned bridge building from the reigning bridge engineer, Gustav Lindenthal. As his prot�g�, Ammann worked on the Hell Gate Railroad Bridge, an arch bridge of unprecedented strength and beauty. Lindenthal had plans for an enormous rail bridge across the Hudson River, but they were rejected as too expensive. Ammann proposed a lighter, less expensive span for automobiles and trucks. In a painful parting, he left Lindenthal and built the landmark George Washington Bridge, a span twice as long as any suspension bridge in the world.
Ammann went on to build the Bayonne, Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone, Throgs Neck and Verrazano Narrows. All that commemorates his accomplishments is a modest bust in a bus terminal at the east end of the George Washington Bridge. Ammann cared little about honorifics. For him, the fact that his bridges were all built on time and within budget was honor enough.

LATINO AMERICANS is a landmark three-part, six-hour documentary series that is set to air nationally on PBS in the fall of 2013.
It is the first major documentary series for television to chronicle the rich and varied history and experiences of Latinos, who have helped shape the United States over the last 500-plus years and have become, with more than 50 million people, the largest minority group in the U.S.
Immigration is at the heart of the American experience, and a central part of the long-running democratic experiment that is the United States. So it is that our series intersects much that is central to the history of the United States. The story includes expansionism, Manifest Destiny, the Wild West, multiple wars (Mexican-American, Spanish-American, World War II), the rise of organized labor, the Great Depression, the post WWII boom, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, globalization, and the effects of multiple kinds of technologies – from the railroad and barbed wire to the internet and satellite television.
Despite such familiar landmarks, our history will go to places where standard U.S. histories do not tend to tread. The series will be driven by the human dramas of our characters' struggles and triumphs, successes and disappointments, both historical personages and living ones. They are people whose stories tell us much about their times.

The films will chronicle Latinos in the United States from the sixteenth century to present day. It is a story of people, politics, and culture, large in scale and deep in its reach. The changing and yet repeating context of American history provides a backdrop for the drama of individual lives. It is a story of immigration and redemption, of anguish and celebration, of the gradual construction of a new American identity that connects and empowers millions of people today.
LATINO AMERICANS features interviews with an array of individuals, including entertainer Rita Moreno, the Puerto Rican star of West Side Story and a winner of Academy, Tony, Grammy and Emmy Awards; labor leader and 2012 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Dolores Huerta, who in the 1960s co-founded with César Chávez the National Farm Workers Association, which later became United Farm Workers of America; Mexican-American author and commentator Linda Chávez, who became the highest-ranking woman in the Reagan White House; and Cuban singer and entrepreneur Gloria Estefan, who has sold more than 100 million solo and Miami Sound Machine albums globally.

COMMENTS +1 EMAILSUPPORT FOR PBS NEWSHOUR PROVIDED BYMORE VIDEONews Wrap: Senate blocks bill on military sexual assaultsEconomic gap takes priority in Obama’s 2015 budgetPreviewing the governor’s race in Texas +1 EMAILLISTEN http://www-tc.pbs.org/newshour/rss/media/2009/05/22/20090522_shieldsbrooks.mp3SEE PODCASTSTRANSCRIPTJIM LEHRER: And to the analysis of Shields and Brooks, syndicated columnist Mark Shields, New York Times columnist David Brooks.Mark, was there a winner in the battle of the Obama and Cheney speeches?MARK SHIELDS, Syndicated Columnist: Well, I think the winner, you know, straight up, down, was the president. It’s tough to go against the president, especially this president, who has a capacity to marshal his argument and make his case.And Dick Cheney, in many respects, is a flawed messenger, maybe disabled messenger for a party that is hemorrhaging support right now.The only question that I’ve had raised by Democrats was whether this was the wisest use of the president’s time, talent, and finite political — you know, his political prowess, I guess.JIM LEHRER: The idea that, why should the president of the United States be going toe to toe with a former vice president of the United States on something like that?DAVID BROOKS, Columnist, New York Times: Yes, but this is a huge issue. I mean, this is a big issue where the president’s made a whole series of discrete decisions, and he hasn’t laid it out for everybody. And this is a big issue, I think, of great concern to the left, but of concern to the country. I think it’s absolutely appropriate to use the president’s time.And I would say he emerges as the big winner because this is an unfair fight. Dick Cheney doesn’t speak for the Republican Party. He doesn’t speak for where John McCain, the last Republican nominee, was on this issue. McCain is closer to Obama. He doesn’t speak to where George Bush was in the second term.I mean, my main point is that the policy that George Bush had in the second term is very, very, very close to the policy Barack Obama has right now. We have a bipartisan policy on terror these days.If you look at the individual issues of rendition, habeas corpus, the secret prisons, Obama has taken the Bush policy, made some adjustments, mostly minor, and then co-opted it. We have a bipartisan policy. My problem is nobody could admit that fact.Barack Obama can’t admit to the Democratic Party that he took George Bush’s policy, and Dick Cheney wants to pretend that Barack Obama has made this vast departure so he can pretend that somehow we’re less safe.Re-examining Bush's policiesMark ShieldsNew York Times I talked to some Bush people yesterday, and they said that the Cheney speech was very familiar to them. He's been making all those arguments within the Bush White House, while he was losing the arguments, and now he made them publicly. JIM LEHRER: That make sense to you?MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think it's a classic David insight, and perhaps a little bit of an overreach.JIM LEHRER: I think that's a no.DAVID BROOKS: That's the most insulting thing I've ever heard in my life.JIM LEHRER: You don't have to take that. You don't have to take that, David.MARK SHIELDS: I withdraw that compliment then. No, I think the president made quite clearly his differences in the speech yesterday. I mean, it was interesting. The first part of the speech was an indictment of what had gone before...JIM LEHRER: Of the Bush administration?MARK SHIELDS: That's right, of the mess we'd gotten into. Now, the president has also said -- and I think with some validity -- that Vice President Cheney was driven to speak -- and I think David's right, he's not speaking for the Republicans -- he was speaking as much against the policies that changed in the Bush administration in the second -- in defense of those that he had argued and for which he ultimately paid a certain price socially and powerfully in the administration itself.JIM LEHRER: So you agree with David?MARK SHIELDS: Well, no, I think the president made the case, though, that the techniques were wrong, that the going it alone, not talking to people was wrong, that unilateral military action was wrong, that the enhanced interrogation techniques, the torture put our troops at risk, put Americans at risk, recruited terrorists.I mean, I think he made a very strong case against it. Then he pivoted and tried to make the case for the future, which is a more difficult case.DAVID BROOKS: First, I would say that's the kind of point Mark would make.JIM LEHRER: Yes, right.DAVID BROOKS: But we stopped torturing people -- we stopped waterboarding people in -- I think it's March or certainly winter 2003. That's a long time ago.What happened was, in the first years of the Bush administration, right after 9/11, they did a lot of stuff, but those policies were morally offensive and unsustainable. And people like Steve Hadley and Condoleezza Rice reined them in.And you had an evolution over 2003, '04, '05, '06, '07, and '08 moving away from the policies that Dick Cheney now celebrates to a whole set of different policies, which are close to what Obama celebrates.And I talked to some Bush people yesterday, and they said that the Cheney speech was very familiar to them. He's been making all those arguments within the Bush White House, while he was losing the arguments, and now he made them publicly.And so I do think what Obama did -- very politically astutely, I guess, though not quite honestly -- was to pretend 2002, 2003, the Bush-Cheney era, was the entire Bush era, and it wasn't. And so he sort of had a little political sleight of hand.But the good news is -- and this is Obama's major accomplishment -- and Mark did mention this -- is that, first of all, he took some sensible policies the professionals in the field really believe in. And he did something George Bush would never do, which is, A, to build a framework around them so they're sustainable and coherent and then, most importantly, to explain them to people.The Bush had this vast evolution in policy, but Bush didn't care what people thought so he never explained them to people, would never admit he was changing course. Obama explained them and made them credible, and that's a big improvement.Reconciling ideals with securityMark ShieldsSyndicated Columnist There is sort of an urge on [Cheney's] part to re-litigate those eight years to go back and especially to return to 9/11 and make the case that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people were saved by these methods. MARK SHIELDS: I agree. I mean, his ability to explain is certainly superior to his predecessors.But I think what President Obama did yesterday was to make the case, which has never been made by anybody in or out of the previous administration, that our values and security were not at war. I mean...JIM LEHRER: It wasn't an either/or thing?MARK SHIELDS: That's right, that we did not have to sacrifice, that his primary and overriding responsibility is to assure especially Democrats -- who had become the bed-wetter caucus up on Capitol Hill on this issue -- to assure them that the security of the nation, the security of our troops was of paramount urgency and overriding importance to him, but that our values really did not have to be compromised in that pursuit.And I thought the choice, sacrificing acoustics for symbolism, of doing it at the Archives with the Constitution there was powerful.JIM LEHRER: What about -- yes?DAVID BROOKS: No, I would say that's mostly true, but it's not always true. I mean, we have 600 prisoners in Kabul. We don't give them habeas corpus rights. We have rendition still going on. There are some cases where they are at war and there is a tension between these two. That's unavoidable; I think the president acknowledges that.MARK SHIELDS: He did.DAVID BROOKS: That's why we have indefinite detentions under Barack Obama, something nobody likes and not really consistent with our values, but there are undeniable tensions.I think one of the nice things that Obama did was he laid out these different levels of prisoners and said, These are tough calls, and I have tried to do the best I can, which is a very adult way of doing it.JIM LEHRER: What about from Cheney's point of view? What explains former Vice President Cheney's -- he said it over and over again, he said it before he said it yesterday, but this idea that the country has been made unsafe or less safe because of all these things that the Obama administration has done. Is that going to ring true out there, do you think?MARK SHIELDS: Well, it certainly hasn't, as of now or up to now. I mean, 27 times he mentioned 9/11 in that speech yesterday. It was rather remarkable. I mean, there is sort of an urge on his part to re-litigate those eight years to go back and especially to return to 9/11 and make the case that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people were saved by these methods...JIM LEHRER: He said that again.MARK SHIELDS: ... with which he's been identified, for which there is no proof, and then to kind of cherry-pick. I mean, he endorses Dennis Blair's statement about valuable information...JIM LEHRER: The national intelligence...MARK SHIELDS: ... national intelligence -- but then leaves out Dennis Blair's saying that this is -- overall, it hurt the nation's security, in the sense that, because of the values that were undermined, and it was not -- it was not worth what the sacrifice and the compromises that were made.So there's something there with him. I don't know. I've heard Republicans -- David has better sources with them than I do -- suggest that he has never really gotten over the failure of President Bush to pardon Scooter Libby.Cheney's motivationsDavid BrooksNew York Times I just think [Cheney] genuinely believes those policies. He believes in enhanced interrogation technique. He thinks that saved lives... I don't agree with him, but I don't think he's Voldemort. JIM LEHRER: Does that sound right?...DAVID BROOKS: I don't think that's -- I think it's conviction. I just think he genuinely believes those policies. He believes in enhanced interrogation technique. He thinks that saved lives.I think it's a matter of just raw conviction. There's no other reason to do this.I don't agree with him, but I don't think he's Voldemort. I don't think the way he's been cast aside as this dark menace is totally fair. I think it's a legitimate argument. I've heard people who are professional, nonpartisan people, when you ask them, "Well, do you get information from some of these technique? Is it worth it?" Most of them say it's not worth it, but they never slam the door shut, they never say it's a closed argument. Some of them say it's a jump-ball, it's 50/50, it's a close case.So the point of view he represents is something I don't agree with, but I think it's a real point of view, and I think he really is doing it out of conviction that the nation...MARK SHIELDS: I'm not questioning his conviction, but he's doing it with a vehemence and almost an intensity that is totally disproportionate.DAVID BROOKS: The one area I'd say he's wrong -- I mean, he emphasized 9/11, as Mark said, and I think he's right about that. I think the fear that we felt on 9/11 was true and useful.But then he's wrong to say, because you think 9/11 was an important event that your policies always have to stay stuck in amber from 2002. That's not true. You can feel the fear. You can feel the importance of that event and still your policies can evolve, which is what they did in the Bush administration, and he won't accept that.JIM LEHRER: Won't accept that.Obama's Supreme Court nomineeMark ShieldsSyndicated Columnist If the president came with the predictable, conventional, liberal nominee, that there was no place at all to find any common ground, then I think there'd be some resistance and maybe some anger. But I don't see it right now. JIM LEHRER: All right, new subject, related, the Supreme Court nominations, apparently it could be released, announced this coming week. Do you anticipate a real serious fight over this? What's your reading of the leaves on both sides?MARK SHIELDS: Well, I don't get a sense that there's going to be a great fight. I don't think the Republicans have the stomach for it right now.If the president came with the predictable, conventional, liberal nominee, that there was no place at all to find any common ground, then I think there'd be some resistance and maybe some anger.But I don't see it right now. And I think what the president, according to people at the White House, is looking for is somebody who can -- who's not going to change the political line-up of the court, but maybe change the intellectual dynamic of the court by having somebody who can, perhaps, think a little bit more creatively and imaginatively about the progressive positions in making the case, not only within the court itself, but to the nation at large and the community.JIM LEHRER: That's really it, isn't it, David? I mean, there's nobody suggesting that Barack Obama is going to select somebody who's going to change the 5-4 split in the Supreme Court as we speak, right?DAVID BROOKS: Right.JIM LEHRER: Because Souter was one of the four or the five.MARK SHIELDS: That's right.JIM LEHRER: But depending on where things were, where Tony Kennedy went, where Anthony Kennedy went, yes.DAVID BROOKS: But I do think the president thinks the chief justice, John Roberts, is a more aggressive arguer for the conservative cause than a lot of people would have thought when he was confirmed. And, therefore, I think he thinks there's a greater need, as Mark said, for a counterweight, and I think especially in the area of civil rights.I think his interpretation is Roberts is more aggressive on the conservative side of civil rights issues, and he wants maybe a counterbalance of that.MARK SHIELDS: One of his people said that the Lilly Ledbetter case is probably the perfect example, I mean, where -- it's the woman who had been deprived the same pay wage as men for years and years, and then was denied the right to sue for it, that Barack Obama would come down on the side of what great interpretation of justice that this is somebody who had been unjustly treated, whereas John Roberts and the court had, in fact, come down the other way. And I think he's looking for somebody who can make that case.JIM LEHRER: Has there ever been a time -- I can't think of one, so if you all can, please help me -- where there's been a Supreme Court opening where it's been a given that a white male need not apply, there isn't going to be one, no matter what, it's going to be a woman or a member of a minority, correct?DAVID BROOKS: Right, it's...JIM LEHRER: Am I right about that?DAVID BROOKS: Well, some people thought that after Sandra Day O'Connor left the court, but I think you're right about that. I myself am troubled by that.JIM LEHRER: Are you?DAVID BROOKS: I'm not sure I'd do anything differently if I were the president, but kind of judging people by the shape of their sexual organs to me is a problem.MARK SHIELDS: There's no question how little debate and discussion there is upon it, but, I mean, when you raise it...JIM LEHRER: It's a given. It's just a given.MARK SHIELDS: Yes, you say, we're not -- not everybody is eligible. And it's -- so David Souter...JIM LEHRER: This was after centuries where only white males were eligible.MARK SHIELDS: That's right. That's right. The Sandra Day O'Connor seat is going to be...JIM LEHRER: It's a hard -- it's a hard complaint to make at this point.MARK SHIELDS: Especially as a white male.JIM LEHRER: Thank you, fellow white males.

During his first month in office, President George W. Bush appointed Vice President Dick Cheney to head a task force charged with developing the country's energy policy. The group, which conducted its meetings in secret, relied on the recommendations of Big Oil behemoths Exxon Mobil, Conoco, Shell Oil, BP America and Chevron. It would be the first of many moves to come during the Bush administration that would position oil and gas companies well ahead of other energy interests with billions of dollars in subsidies and tax cuts—payback for an industry with strong ties to the administration and plenty of money to contribute to congressional and presidential campaigns.
During the time that Bush and Cheney, both of whom are former oil executives, have been in the White House, the oil and gas industry has spent $393.2 million on lobbying the federal government. This places the industry among the top nine in lobbying expenditures. The industry has also contributed a substantial $82.1 million to federal candidates, parties and political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 80 percent of the industry's contributions have gone to Republicans.
Buying Pro-Industry Policy
This support has not gone unrewarded. In 2005, Bush, who has received more from the oil and gas industry than any other politician, signed an energy bill from the Republican-controlled Congress that gave $14.5 billion in tax breaks for oil, gas, nuclear power and coal companies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was based on recommendations by Cheney's energy task force, also rolled back regulations the oil industry considered burdensome, including exemptions from some clean water laws. All of this transpired only one year after Congress passed a bill that included a tax cut for domestic manufacturing that was expected to save energy companies at least $3.6 billion over a decade.
"Political action committees, lobbyists and executives do not give money to politicians or parties out of an altruistic support of the principles of democracy," says Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen's Energy Program. "They are savvy investors expecting a return on their investments. Politicians routinely deliver on campaign contributions that are provided to them... [by] giving goodies to the industry." And the size of those contributions matters.
In comparison, environmental groups and alternative energy production and supply companies, which didn't see similar benefits come out of the Republican Congress's legislation, have made paltry contributions. Environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters and the Nature Conservancy, which often push for policy that is punitive to Big Oil, have given nearly 11 times less than the oil industry since 2001. The disparity is not a strategic difference, but the financial reality for these smaller competing interests. Exxon Mobil, for example, reported the largest annual profit on record for a U.S. corporation in 2006, bringing in $39.5 billion. Comparatively, the nonprofit Sierra Club Foundation—which funds organizations in addition to the Sierra Club—reported income in 2006 of $29 million.
With members of Congress paying special attention to Big Oil, the policy that elected representatives have developed does not reflect the interest of the public, which wants "affordable, reliable, clean sources of energy," Slocum says. A 2006 survey by the Pew Research Center found a majority of Americans across the political spectrum want an energy policy that emphasizes renewable and alternative sources of energy.
"Energy companies have a right to have a say in energy policy. Do they have a right to dictate energy policy, to be the only people at the table? Absolutely not. That was the main problem with the Cheney task force—[the industry] was the only one at the table," says Slocum.
To keep its prominent seat, the industry spends big sums of money on hiring the top lobbyists in Washington to push its agenda on a variety of issues, not just related to energy but on issues ranging from education to real estate. After a few years of declining lobbying expenditures, the industry spent $63.3 million in 2005, most of which was probably related to the energy bill. (Lobbying reports don't require lobbyists to itemize their spending related to specific bills or amendments). In 2007, with a new energy bill in the pipeline, the industry's lobbying expenditures are on track to exceed last year's total of $73 million. Big Oil has spent seven times more than environmental groups on lobbying since President Bush took office.
Marchant Wentworth, a lobbyist for the environmental advocacy group the Union of Concerned Scientists, says money buys access. "I've been working in the public interest environmental business for 30 years and 90 percent of the time I'm talking to staff," Wentworth said. "The oil and gas industry talks to the members themselves. That is a huge difference. Access is an important thing."
The Biggest Spenders and Takers
"With a new energy bill in the pipeline, the industry's lobbying expenditures are on track to exceed last year's total of $73 million."
The energy companies that spend the most on lobbying the federal government also tend to be those that give the most to politicians for their campaigns. Since 2001, Exxon Mobil, Marathon Oil, Shell Oil, Chevron and BP America—many of which provided guidance to Cheney's task force—have spent the most among energy companies on lobbying. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, in addition to El Paso Corp and Koch Industries, have been among the most generous campaign contributors within the industry during Bush's time in office. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil industry in Washington, declined to comment for this story, and a spokesman from the national trade group the Independent Petroleum Association of America was unavailable for comment.
Lawmakers, who live in areas that depend on oil production for their economy, are likely to be among the largest recipients of contributions from the oil and gas industry—and to vote in favor of legislation that helps it. The top three members of Congress to receive money from Big Oil during the Bush administration are all Republicans and are, not surprisingly, all from oil-rich Texas. The big names include Sens. John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both of whom have supported subsidies for gas and oil exploration and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Also is Rep. Joe Barton, who sponsored the 2005 energy bill and was chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee at the time. Fellow Texan Tom DeLay, who was the House Majority Leader in 2005 and was instrumental in pushing the energy bill through, also ranks among the top to receive money from the industry during Bush's two terms. Of the 50 members of Congress who have received the most contributions from oil and gas companies since 2001, only six are Democrats.
Campaign contributions don't always get the oil industry desired results. Many of the oil industry chieftains, who were pushing to open ANWR for exploration, were disappointed when the 2005 energy bill came out of conference committee without that provision. Nor, do campaign contributions always get the industry's favorite candidates elected. Four of five of Big Oil's most favored candidates—all Republicans—lost their re-election races in 2006, despite hefty campaign contributions from oil and gas employees and PACs that cycle. The losers included Sens. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Conrad Burns of Montana, George Allen of Virginia and James Talent of Missouri.
Battles on the Horizon
With Democrats now in control of Congress, the oil and gas industry is finding that it's getting less for its money on Capitol Hill. Other industries with competing interests and far less cash to spread around, such as environmental groups and alternative energy producers, are now finding more support for their legislative goals. For example, the Clean Energy Act of 2007 seeks to repeal the 2004 and 2005 tax breaks to Big Oil and re-direct the money to renewable energy efforts.
Because of the change in power, the oil industry faces the possibility of stricter oversight and fewer goodies from Congress. The industry "definitely has to be worried that there will be anti-oil legislation of all types, and also possibly regulations, depending on who takes over the White House," says David Victor, a law professor at Stanford University and a senior fellow on the Council for Foreign Relations. Victor was part of the council's task force on energy security.
"I think [the new leadership] generally puts the issue on the agenda for legislative action. It puts it higher on the agenda. But it's not clear Congress will actually be able to do very much in terms of getting the votes for legislation, because energy policy in reality is very controversial and often very expensive," Victor said. "That's something that both parties have a difficult time dealing with."
So far Congress has been slow to push through comprehensive energy legislation, in part because issues related to renewable energy standards and fuel efficiency standards differ by region, rather than political party, which means not all democrats are on board, says Frank O'Donnell, president of the environmental advocacy group Clean Air Watch. "Some of the southern-based coal burning power companies have killed or delayed efforts to set a renewable energy requirement for electric companies. Michigan Reps. and others influenced by the car industry have also managed to put off any kind of tougher requirements for fuel economy." O'Donnell says. "John Dingell is a democrat but doesn't see eye to eye with [Speaker of the House] Nancy Pelosi in some of these issues and so far you've seen somewhat of a stalemate."
Dingell has consistently defended the auto industry, which is fighting against stricter fuel economy standards. These standards have not been changed since the 1980s. The auto industry is a major player in Dingell's home state of Michigan, which relies heavily on the industry for jobs and is the corporate home of General Motors, Ford and the domestic division of DaimlerChrysler. Among all members of Congress, Dingell has received the second most in contributions from the auto industry at $869,200, just behind Republican Spencer Abraham, a former Michigan senator. The industry has been one of Dingell's largest contributors during his career—second only to electric utilities.
During former President Bill Clinton's administration, Congressional Democrats who supported more rigid standards missed a chance to pass such legislation, but they had to grapple with a Republican-controlled Congress largely unsympathetic to the idea. Congress just adjourned for the Thanksgiving break without voting on an energy bill that would, among other things, boost the fuel efficiency of the nation's vehicles. Speaker Pelosi had hoped but failed to bring the measure to a vote, largely because negotiations stalled over the fuel economy standards.
"With Democrats now in control of Congress, the oil and gas industry is finding that it's getting less for its money on Capitol Hill."
The Changing Climate for Energy Policy
As Congress wrestles with the comprehensive energy legislation, the oil and gas industry is not only fighting off repeals of its tax breaks, but is pushing again for increased domestic production of energy, specifically permission to drill in certain coastal areas that have been off limits. The companies are also trying to prevent democrats from prosecuting them for jacking up prices excessively and they publicly oppose the bill's mandated use of alternative fuels. The industry joined the fight for coal-to-liquid fuel, in which oil companies have investments, but the controversial provision to encourage creating diesel fuel from domestic coal has already been eliminated from both the house and senate's versions of the bill. The legislation is also meant to correct an error by the interior department during former President Bill Clinton's time in office that allowed many companies to drill in deep waters without paying royalties. [for more on the royalty issue, see NOW reports "The Royalty Treatment" and "Crude Awakening"]
The best Big Oil can do right now is slow down the legislation, Wentworth of the Union of Concerned Scientists says. "The [legislation] is being held up because the oil and gas industry is concerned about closing loopholes for offshore drilling," he says. "They're fighting this tooth and nail. This is slowing down the clean energy solutions that the public wants."
Environmentalists, who had very little influence in Congress when Republicans were in control, are now seeing the lawmakers seriously consider their positions. This includes environmentalists' support of fuel efficiency standards, a mandate for electric utility companies to produce 15 percent of electricity from renewable sources and their opposition to coal-to-liquid fuel development. Nowhere is this change in tides more evident than in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which is heavily involved in energy legislation. California Sen. Barbara Boxer, considered one of the environment's biggest champions, has chaired the committee since her party assumed control of the Senate in the 2006 election. Boxer replaced Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican who has received $572,000 from the oil and gas industry since President Bush took office—more than all but three other members of Congress. Since 2001, Boxer has received less than $13,000 from the industry and nearly 69 times more from environmental policy groups than Inhofe.
"The oil and gas industry, like almost every other industry, will shift some donations from Republicans to Democrats," says Eric Smith, a political scientist who researches environmental policy at the University of California-Santa Barbara. "It's clear that the industry strongly prefers to have Republicans in power, but industries generally focus on short-term advantages. In the short term—now and presumably after the 2008 elections—Democrats hold congressional majorities. So to win the short-term battles, the industry must try to persuade Democrats in Congress to go easy on them."
Big Oil, which has always contributed heavily to Republicans, isn't likely to defensively switch its contributions to favor Democrats. But so far this year, 27 percent of the industry's contributions have gone to Democrats, up from 18 percent in the 2006 election cycle, when Republicans were still in power.
The Democratic Congress has made clean energy legislation a priority because of rising gas prices and concerns about the nation's dependence on foreign oil sources, in addition to a scientific consensus that human activity is the root cause of today's global warming. Many Republicans, too, are on board and looking for solutions. "The single most important thing that's happened in the last five years is the price of oil has shot up," Stanford's David Victor says. "That run-up has changed the politics and incentives for people to take an interest in conservation, and that's completely bipartisan. There are people in the left wing and the right wing that say we need to do something about this problem."
*Total includes all contributions greater than $200. The Federal Election Commission does not require recipients to itemize smaller donations.

Should Insider Trading Be Legal?
Follow @jbrezlowJanuary 7, 2014, 9:44 pm ET by Jason M. Breslow	E-Mail ThisTweet	The government’s historic crackdown on insider trading has shaken Wall Street. To date, authorities have filed charges against roughly 80 individuals, winning at least 78 of those cases through either a guilty plea or conviction at trial. Along the way, they’ve brought down hedge fund titan Raj Rajaratnam of the now defunct Galleon Group, and forced Steven Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors to end its business of managing money for outside investors.
The dragnet has also revived a debate over whether insider trading should even be illegal to begin with. While supporters of tougher enforcement say the ban helps to “level the playing field,” critics argue that the costs of ridding markets of such illicit deal-making outweigh the benefits. Some go as far as to call it a victimless crime.
With that it mind, we invited two Wall Street experts to join us for a debate on the issue. Arguing in favor of decriminalization is John Carney, a senior editor for CNBC.com and co-author of the site’s NetNet blog covering high jinks on Wall Street. Arguing against the motion is Matthew Yglesias, a business and economics correspondent for Slate and the author of The Rent Is Too Damn High. Here’s what they had to say:
Dear Matt,
When the government’s great dragnet against insider trading reached a crescendo this summer with the indictment of SAC Capital, something quite surprising happened. Conventional wisdom shifted toward a view that had long been as disreputable as it was rare. People began to wonder aloud if the ban on insider trading was a mistake, a policy that should be repealed.
This came as a shock to me. I’ve been an advocate of repealing the ban on insider trading ever since I first learned such a thing existed. But this was a heterodox position, something that earned me a reputation of someone defending the indefensible everywhere I went. First in law school, then when I was a practicing attorney, and finally as a journalist. But I never expected that this was an argument I might win.
So what happened? Two things I think. First, it became all too obvious that the official rationales for banning insider trading make no sense. The ban doesn’t create a level playing field or even meaningfully contribute to it. The phrase “fraud on the market” is gibberish: market quality is actually improved by insider trading because stock prices better reflect the undisclosed realities of corporate fortunes. There are no investors victimized by insider trading.
Take the allegation that a trader at SAC got insider information that a drug wasn’t testing well and so sold some of the stock in the company, avoiding losses when the information eventually became public and the stock price dropped. No one who bought or sold the stock while SAC was in possession of this information would have done better if SAC hadn’t had the information. In fact, buyers would have likely done worse since SAC’s sales may have depressed the price a bit. It was victimless: so why is it a crime?
The second thing that happened was that people began to realize that the pursuit of insider trading had dramatically changed over the last few years. The government now employs legal tools — such as secret wiretaps – developed to defeat the Mafia or stop terrorists in an effort to catch people trading on nonpublic information. This strikes a lot of people as unreasonable in light of the benign nature of insider trading. In the United States we might tolerate a surveillance state narrowly tailored to catch mobsters, drug kingpins and terrorists — but anything much beyond that strikes us as government overreach. It’s the NSA scandal in miniature.
Of course, the government is headed in the opposite direction. New York’s chief federal prosecutor, for example, is convinced that he’s performing a great public service by pursuing alleged insider traders. So I don’t expect the law to change any time soon. But perhaps it’s not too much to hope that the government can someday be talked down from its current insider trading mania to regard it as something best left to civil authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.
So, what do you say? Are you going to join the rest of us in the great crusade to decriminalize insider trading?
Dear John,
When I was young and irresponsible, I was an insider trading legalizer myself. It seemed like a bold and contrarian stance of the best possible kind. A little bit of a right-wing deregulatory impulse, but also an element of populism to boot.
After all, the basic premise of insider trading bans as a consumer protection really is kind of fishy. The best way to avoid losing money playing blackjack isn’t to look for the most honest casino in town, it’s to not gamble. By the same token, the idea of a “fair” stock market in which it would make sense for middle class investors to pick stocks and trade is fantastical. What the mass of savers and investors need to know is that you shouldn’t overtrade, shouldn’t try to beat the market, and shouldn’t pick stocks. Find yourself a nice low-fee diversified passive mutual fund or ETF and forget about what the insiders do and don’t know.
On the other hand, I don’t think the argument that allowing insider trading would improve market efficiency by putting more information to work makes much sense. As Jie Hue and Thomas Noe write in their analysis of the issue for the Atlanta Federal Reserve, the existence of a sophisticated securities analysis industry in the United States means we don’t really face the problem of a major informational gap. Just look at this year’s Nobel Prize winners in economics. Eugene Fama has shown that U.S. equities markets are essentially “efficient” in an informational sense as is. His co-winner, Robert Shiller, has done an enormous amount to demonstrate that this kind of efficiency hardly precludes periodic manias and panics and that asset prices fluctuate much more dramatically than the fundamentals. But the substantial holes poked in the theory of the stock market as efficient point to herd psychology as the key flaw, not hidden information that insider trading would reveal.
The real impact of legalizing insider trading, in this instance, would be twofold. On the one hand, firms that don’t want their insiders to trade on inside information would need to invest in their own monitoring and enforcement mechanisms of firm-level rules. On the other hand, firms that didn’t bother to invest in halting insider trading could construe permissive insider trading rules as a form of additional compensation to employees.
The first impact hardly seems desirable. Since firms couldn’t level the same kind of sanctions as the government, the monitoring would need to be much more intensive and expensive to produce equivalent deterrence, leading to a huge waste of social resources. And the second impact seems potentially disastrous. The last thing the American economy needs is a dynamic in which managers of major corporations have even more financial incentive to spend their time thinking about ways to game the stock market rather than manage their enterprises for the long term.
There are some good questions to be asked about the overall role of surveillance in American law enforcement that would, of course, have important implications for insider trading cases as well as other kinds of criminal activity. But the fundamental social goal of securities law is to have well-managed, well-capitalized enterprises and the ban on insider trading serves those goals perfectly well as it stands.
Dear Matt,
I think you may still be younger and more irresponsible than you reckon. Or, at least, your views may be far closer than you think to those of us who advocate decriminalizing insider trading.
Let’s start with your first point about the problem of private enforcement of insider trading rules. I agree with you that there are often gains from centralization and professionalization of protective services. It’s pretty easy to see, for example, that while it might create a lot of great incentives for homes to engage in fire-proofing, having every household responsible for its own fire-fighting would be socially costly (even if we ignore the negative externalities of things like your neighbor’s house catching fire). Dedicated fire departments, with trained fire fighters, are a good idea.
This is likely the case with policing insider trading. The SEC and the self-regulating market organizations have a lot of experience and expertise here. Being able to levy fines is a powerful tool for controlling behavior. A corporation would have a much harder time monitoring and enforcing rules against insider trading without potential government sanction.
Importantly, however, this describes a rationale for an optional ban on insider trading rather than a mandatory one. That is, a rule against insider trading that corporations could opt-into, thereby gaining the benefits of government assisted enforcement. It’s not a rationale for a blanket ban that applies to corporations that would rather permit insider trading.
Your second point is mysterious to me. If we had an opt-in rule, why would anything disastrous occur? If permitting insider trading truly created incentives that undermined corporate performance over the long term, then shareholders would discount the shares for that. If shareholders disagree with you about the effects of insider trading on corporate performance, then we might not see it discounted. How would you know in advance which is preferable? Most likely, in some sectors and some companies where cash is hard to come by, it would make sense to compensate through insider trading. And in others, it wouldn’t. This is the virtue of an optional insider trading regime: it recognizes the heterogeneity of corporate economics.
Surely this is a better path toward well-functioning capital enterprises than a one-size-fits-all ban on insider trading.
Dear John,
The opt-in suggestion is intriguing.
From time-to-time I’m reminded of a seminar I took in college taught by the late great libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick. He observed that many regulatory functions that normal people think are necessary for the government to undertake — food safety, for example — could be easily discharged by the private sector. Given the choice between a certified safe can of beans and an uncertified can of beans, surely consumers would prefer the safe one. So a sensible canning firm would want to contract with a credible food inspection service to certify its beans. And as the long-term value of the food inspection service’s franchise would rest on its credibility in the marketplace, the inspectors would have reason to judge food vendors in a harsh and credible manner.
Bye bye FDA, hello libertopia. And if it works for beans, why not for insider trading?
Sensible people, I think, shy away from this kind of thinking. It’s easy to sketch out a diagram about reputational effects and consumer preferences and how it all works out in the end. But then it’s easy to remember the case of the bond ratings agencies, who actually do operate on this principle, and who at the peak of the housing bubble were all-too-happy to offer AAA ratings to mortgage backed securities that turned out to have major risks.
And when it comes to beans, one of the virtues of the present regulatory system is that it actually works just fine. People buy their cans and don’t get poisoned. The only real motivation for the hypothetical privatization of food safety is to demonstrate to undergraduates that ideologically rigorous libertarianism needn’t necessarily entail as many upheavals of everyday life as one might think. But from my viewpoint it’s a solution in search of a problem. And the idea of allowing opt-in or opt-out from insider trading rules strikes me as much the same. What problem are we trying to solve by legalizing insider trading? As a journalist, I agree that it’d be kind of fascinating to see what would happen if we did it — I’d be curious. But again, it seems to me that if you want to find a problem with contemporary American equity markets it’s that they offer excessively strong incentives for managers to sweat short-term price trends and quarterly earnings data. I’m not sure I have a regulatory fix for that, but I’m not going to embrace a step in the other direction.
Meanwhile, John, a question for you: How far would you take this logic? After all, the ban on insider trading is hardly the only rule of corporate governance in America. Should we just make it all opt-in? Establish a board with outside directors if shareholders demand it, but not otherwise? Release quarterly earnings if you like, but skip it if you don’t feel like it? In other words, is the ban on insider trading a particular bugaboo or just step one to a radical rethink of securities law and corporate governance?
Matt,
Let me admit that I admire your basically conservative instinct not to overturn laws just because they seem to make no sense. As Robert Frost taught us, sometimes it is better to mend walls even when we don’t really understand why they’re there anymore.
The problem is that the criminalization of insider trading isn’t some harmless legal rule. It’s very, very harmful. We’re sending people to jail for years, even decades, based on legal theories of “fraud on the market” that you and I agree don’t make any sense. Our courts are authorizing invasions of privacy, including open-ended wire-tapping, in pursuit of those the Justice Department suspects of insider trading. We’ve made a pariah out of one of the most successful traders of all time, Steve Cohen, and chased every outside investor out of his firm, SAC Capital. There are real human costs inflicted by the ban on insider trading.
The pursuit of insider trading is also diverting resources away from the pursuit of more serious financial wrongdoing. But don’t take my word for it. Here’s what Judge Jed Rakoff recently wrote in The New York Review of Books:
As for the Department of Justice proper, a decision was made in 2009 to spread the investigation of financial fraud cases among numerous U.S. Attorney’s Offices, many of which had little or no previous experience in investigating and prosecuting sophisticated financial frauds. This was in connection with the president’s creation of a special task force to investigate the crisis, from which remarkably little has been heard in the intervening four-plus years. At the same time, the U.S. Attorney’s Office with the greatest expertise in these kinds of cases, the Southern District of New York, was just embarking on its prosecution of insider-trading cases arising from the Raj Rajaratnam tapes, which soon proved a gold mine of prosecutable cases that absorbed a huge amount of the attention of the securities fraud unit of that office.
While I want to stress again that I have no inside information, as a former chief of that unit I would venture to guess that the cases involving the financial crisis were parceled out to assistant U.S. attorneys who were also responsible for insider-trading cases. Which do you think an assistant would devote most of her attention to: an insider-trading case that was already nearly ready to go to indictment and that might lead to a high-visibility trial, or a financial crisis case that was just getting started, would take years to complete, and had no guarantee of even leading to an indictment? Of course, she would put her energy into the insider-trading case, and if she was lucky, it would go to trial, she would win, and, in some cases, she would then take a job with a large law firm. And in the process, the financial fraud case would get lost in the shuffle.
In short, a focus on quite different priorities is, I submit, one of the reasons the financial fraud cases have not been brought, especially cases against high-level individuals that would take many years, many investigators, and a great deal of expertise to investigate.
Perhaps we could have a kinder, gentler insider trading ban that wouldn’t be abused. But I don’t see how we get there. Right now the only option I see available is decriminalization.
Which brings me to the answer to the question at the end of your last missive. If any of those rules were as damaging as the insider trading ban, then yes I’d be in favor of ditching them too. For the most part, however, they’re either relatively harmless, superfluous or both.
John,
As our debate neared its conclusion I found myself at the American Economic Association’s annual meeting where Paul Brockman, Jiri Tresl, and Emre Unlu are presenting a paper that seems quite relevant to our debate. In “The Impact of Insider Trading Laws on Dividend Payout Policy” they examine an international sample of firms across 24 countries and find that insider trading laws seem to have a substantial impact on dividends. Specifically, where insider trading laws are weak we see firms with “a higher propensity of paying dividends, larger dividend amounts, and greater dividend smoothing” than in countries with stricter ones. This is because, it seems, the payment of a relatively high and stable dividend is a way for firm managers to credibly signal to shareholders that they’re not getting ripped off in the absence of a sound legal framework.
This is perhaps a good way of thinking about the fundamental issue that divides us. When I look at the contemporary United States, I’m much more inclined to worry that we are seeing systematically too little capital investment than to worry that owners of corporate stock have too little cash in their pockets. Business investment could create jobs and raise productivity, while stock ownership is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of the most prosperous Americans.
Weakening insider trading protections will shift us into a lower-trust equilibrium in corporate governance where we see less investment and more cash flushing out to people who don’t really need it. A bad recipe.
Your suggestion that vigorous enforcement of insider trading laws is crowding out more worthy investigations is an intriguing one. Certainly even in my role as designated basher of insider trading, I wouldn’t try to make the case that this should be our absolute top priority. That said, there are an awful lot of questions one can raise about priority-setting in the federal law enforcement context. We have federal resources dedicated to hassling medical marijuana dispensaries in California, to policing the size of shampoo bottles that people bring onto airplanes, and into deporting otherwise law-abiding people for the “crime” of moving here from Mexico to roll burritos at Chipotle. Obviously, to debate marijuana legalization or airport security or immigration reform would take us far outside the scope of this exercise.
But my point is that to the extent that we’re really worried about resource constraints here, insider trading enforcement is hardly the only place to look. More broadly, when you look at the scale of the economic losses associated with the financial crisis and the ensuing recession — literally trillions of dollars in unrecoverable lost output — it’s obvious that any genuinely useful regulatory efforts would more than “pay for themselves.” Where I think we can agree is that as a purely political matter the Obama administration has developed a bad habit of acting as if vigorous insider trading enforcement is a way of striking at the heart of the issues that led to the crisis. That’s at best political theater aimed at garnering a little undeserved populist credibility. It’s bad, and the press shouldn’t let them get away with it. But it’s not a reason to legalize insider trading any more than the existence of unsolved murders would be a reason for a state to legalize car theft. America’s market regulators and federal prosecutors likewise need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.
