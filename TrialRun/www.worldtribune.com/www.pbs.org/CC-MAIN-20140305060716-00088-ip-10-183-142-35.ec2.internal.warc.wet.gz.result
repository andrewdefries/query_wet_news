The :30 Second Candidate: Q & A: Alex Castellanos: question 2
2
What do you make of the phenomenon of outside interest groups this year putting on ads to influence elections?
ALEX CASTELLANOS replies:
Politics has gotten a lot more complicated. It used to be like boxing. There was, your candidate was in the ring, the other candidate was in the ring, and you would sort it out. Now you have all other kinds of people and groups climbing into the ring. These advocacy groups who are raising money, spending money. So now there not, there still may be two sides but there may be four, six, eight, ten different campaigns involved. And so it's not like boxing anymore, it's a little bit like the Texas chainsaw wrestling grudge match, you know. Everybody plays. And, it's just made it a lot more complicated.
I think ultimately it takes a little more power out of the hands of the candidates. But that's the way that messy thing democracy works. You know, people actually get up there and try to have their own impact on the process. Don't you just hate it when that happens.

Other Virtual Tours
Doctors performed all types of procedures during the Civil War, from treating common ailments to amputating limbs. Often churches, private homes, or other buildings would be converted to makeshift hospitals and morgues near the site of a battle. Many medical procedures were performed in field tents.
This wall-tent was once owned by surgeon John Wiley of the Sixth New Jersey volunteers. Measuring 9 by 9 by 13 feet, the tent is made of army duck and has its original wooden poles. Wiley served with the Army of the Potomac from 1862 to 1864 and his regiment saw heavy action at Gettysburg, where this tent most certainly was used. The tent is part of the collection at the National Museum of Civil War Medicine in Frederick, Maryland.
