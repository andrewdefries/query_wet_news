Turmoil follows silent protest
16 Jun 2009 13:159 Comments
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran: Article 27 [Freedom of Assembly] states that "Public gatherings and marches may be freely held, provided arms are not carried and that they are not detrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam." Photo/TehranBureau
By AFSHIN SALIMPOUR in Tehran | 15 June 2009
[TEHRAN BUREAU] Dusk on Monday witnessed the most shocking scenes so far from the aftermath to Iran's disputed election. Events have have now escalated to a level of intensity unprecedented since the Iranian revolution of 1979.
State media today reported 7 killed in what they described "an attack on a military post." The reality was far less clear cut, as suggested on Iran's own English language news Web site PressTV.com, which reported that an "unidentified gunmen" had fired shots into the crowd after a "peaceful rally."
That "peaceful rally" ended in gunfire, explosions and the ominous sight of flaming Molotov cocktails spinning through the air.
With five reportedly killed at the Tehran University dormitories the night before, it was all the more surprising that anger had not boiled over immediately. On Monday afternoon at least, far from venting the rage which might have provoked a police reaction, the peoples' anger was displayed on hand-drawn placards carried in silence.
"University Alley, University Alley, murder scene, murder scene" was the written message held aloft on a makeshift paper banner. Rather than ring out in the air, the rhythmic message reverberated inside the minds of all who read it.
Students who witnessed the previous night's attack had described "pressure groups" -- a euphemism for Iran's unofficial paramilitary police, the Basij -- entering both the male and female dormitories of the university in full force, with tear gas canisters, batons and motorcycles.
A defiant silence was perhaps the only adequate response to an attack of such brutality. Hundreds of thousands of people convened on Tehran's symbolic central artery, Islamic Revolution Street, for a peaceful march to Freedom Square.
Former Iranian Prime Minister and this year's foremost presidential challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi himself was to address the crowds in his first public appearance since election night. In the end, his voice was relayed to a handful in his immediate vicinity with a portable megaphone.
* * *
A girl stood motionless, high up on the fence separating the two lanes of the road. Facing the oncoming crowd, her dark eyes stared meaningfully over a surgical face mask, both hands raised in a victory salute. She wore her protest on a printed tunic over her manteau -- the standard covering which Iranian women must wear to conform with Iran's Islamic dress code.
"Where is my vote?" read the slogan in both Farsi and English.
Silence was also a shield. A provision in Iran's constitution states that marches and gatherings may be held as long as they do not disturb "Islamic principles." Supporters interpreted this as permission to protest without slogans, without chants. Even the handful of motorbikes which overtook the marchers kept engine noise down to a minimum.
Every few dozen meters another motionless human public announcement stood facing the crowd. They held written slogans in one hand and fingers to their lips with the other. The intensity and purpose of a crowd which had chosen almost without exception to hold back from
vocal expression was heavy in the air, as was the tangible sense of a common cause.
Yesterday's march was undoubtedly the largest anti-government protest Iran has seen for over thirty years. A decree from the authorities earlier in the day had denied permission for the march to take place but the sheer weight of numbers made any crackdown impossible. Mothers
with children and men and women of all ages mixed with students and young people.
That word had spread to so many in such a short period of time made a mockery of government attempts to restrict communications. Iran's mobile phone text message system has been disabled nationwide since polling day on Friday and internet services such as Facebook and
Twitter have been blocked.
Despite that, the crowd today was easily comparable to the marches held every year on the 11 February to mark the anniversary of the return of Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran in 1979, which signaled the end of the Shah's monarchy. The difference was that at pro-government rallies, the attendance of schoolteachers, students, government workers and Basij paramilitaries is compulsory.
The handful of police which were visible on the route stood in groups of three or four taking in the spectacle. The motorcycle-riding riot police which had charged full-throttle into Saturday's protests were nowhere to be seen. When the procession passed a Basij base, there was a call to be especially slow, quiet and to hold up the two-fingered victory salute.
However, the fear expressed by numerous marchers on the way was that security forces would crack down after dark once protesters had begun to disperse. In the end, it began with several large fires visible on the northern edge of the square while tens of thousands of people were
only beginning to head home.
The sound of pistol shots was followed immediately by a human wave descending on a point in the crowd where, witnesses reported, a group of unidentified plain-clothed attackers had opened fire and killed one man. The flames rose higher, the sound of automatic gunfire rang across the square and the spinning flame of a Molotov cocktail hurtled toward the wall.
After a day of silent protest, another night of turmoil in Tehran had begun.

Dear Tehran Bureau...I support you in your cause...& I today sent this letter to my Minister of Foreign Affair's. Most Irish people want to see Iran given a new election...& it has to be seen to be fair. I am sure Ireland could be a good go between country to trust as regard's sending over-seer's to see any new election is fully fair & even-handedly judged. That's just a thought...but you need judges to see that the result is not corrupt. A lot of people I notice on the BBC's "Have your Say" are wondering how to help...so why not ask the BBC to put your address up either on the site FrontPage or on the "HYS-PAGE. NOW I'LL SAY GOOD-BYE & WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR QUEST FOR PEACEFUL NEW ELECTION'S WITH THE LEADER IRAN REALLY WANTS. GOD BLESS & GOD GUIDE YOU IN YOUR FOOTFALL TO A GREAT FREE & (IRANIAN CULTURAL WAY) DEMOCRATIC FREE FUTURE. SLAN LEAT = (an Irish good-bye)! Dear Minister Martin, I am writing to you, to please ask you as Foreign Minister of our state...not to recognize President Ahmadinejad as President of Iran. You know, like the rest of us that that election was rigged & that Ahmadinejad is hated by most of the people there in the major city's which are heavily populated. And also, by women who have no civil right's what so-ever under this cold monstrous regime. You just have to look at your television New's channel's to see how these people are being horrendously put down in their peaceful protest for to get a new election called. Quite honestly by this stage, the voting papers of the election just gone would most certainly be interfered with by Ahmadinejad supporters & henchmen. That's why there should be a new monitored election.
This is not going to fizzle out, Minister, till the people get fair & due recess, & get the real president who was elected on the seat as president. Now would you please take the good & human position on this & join your French, German, Canadian, New Zealand, and all the other valiant countries that are speaking out for the future of Iran, the future of the region & for the good of the world. Please Minister Martin, stand for the good of the new generation of Iran that want change, voted for change, & now who are trying with the little they have as regards weapon's etc. are standing up to the mighty army, & Basij militia, the cruellest police on the planet. Now Minister, I close asking you to do your duty, your duty of honour, for a beautiful but savagely trodden on people. Remember the fall of the Berlin; this is another of those moments...when GOOD overshadows BAD!
Now minister, I leave it with you, to do your "GOOD" over bad for the good of the people of Iran! Yours faithfully, jojnjo.
jojnjo / June 16, 2009 7:34 PM
Stay Strong and Stay with the cause. This is our generation and we demand to be heard not silenced. Keep a watchful eye and be safe. We throughout the world are with you.
kydsnipe / June 17, 2009 12:43 PM
Be a man and step down Ahmadinejad. Your people hates you... the world despises you. Stop being a thick-faced tyrant!
catherine / June 18, 2009 8:22 AM
I think its about time that the name of Iran should be changed to Republic of Iran.
What about adopting a new political system?
No more Ahmadinejads, no more Ayatollahs, no more mullahs, no more Revolutionary Guards. Make this people extinct.
Make Iran a whole new world. A better place to live in.

Grilled Steak and Onion Salad
by Chef s Melinda Blanchard and Robert Blanchard
Grilled steak and onion salad with a soy sauce dressing, plus a selection of additional dressing recipes
Makes 6 servings
Ingredients
1/3 cup rice wine vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup sherry
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 large yellow onions, sliced 1/2-inch thick
2 yellow bell peppers, seeded and cut into 2-inch-wide strips
Vegetable oil, for basting
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 New York strip steaks (12 ounces each)
4 to 5 cups torn pieces of lettuce
Directions
Prepare the grill.
Make the dressing while the grill is heating: In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sherry, hoisin, mustard and olive oil. Set aside.
Brush the onion slices and yellow peppers with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the vegetables slowly over medium heat until soft and slightly charred, about 10 minutes. Take them off the grill and separate the onion slices into rings.
Grill the steak until desired doneness, about 6 minutes on each side for medium. Cut the steak against the grain into 1/4-inch slices.
Toss the greens with a very light coating of dressing and arrange on a serving platter or individual plates. Spread the onions and peppers on top of the lettuce and arrange the sliced steak attractively on top, allowing the onions and peppers to show through. Drizzle a little more dressing over the salad and serve warm.
