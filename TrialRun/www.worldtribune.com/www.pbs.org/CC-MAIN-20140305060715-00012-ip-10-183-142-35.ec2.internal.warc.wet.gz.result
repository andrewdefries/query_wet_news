Can these revenues be used to pay down the national debt, or is such payment dependent upon industrial production?Paul Solman: Fifty percent is way too high a figure, Missy. The true percentage for “finance and insurance” is probably below 10 percent. But yes, the profits from all companies, including financial services, are taxed and thus become government revenues, just as profits from industrial firms do. As long as we’re running annual budget deficits, though — spending more money than we’re taking in every year — we won’t have anything left from taxes to pay down the national debt. In other words, all the taxes we currently charge ourselves, either directly or indirectly through corporate taxes, are not enough to cover our expenditures and so, every year, we add that year’s deficit to the cumulative national debt.In short, there’s no money left over to pay down the national debt. And as long as we spend more than we tax, the debt is going UP, not down.But wait a minute. I think I’ve misunderstood you. Are you suggesting a new or extra tax on financial institutions?If so, it would need to raise well over a trillion dollars this year alone to cover the deficit and have something left over to pay down our debt. I have a funny feeling that, given the current attitude toward taxes in this country, a new tax on finance isn’t forthcoming.

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: Well, this painting was given to my grandparents, because Maynard was my grandfather's first cousin, so there's a very personal attachment to it. Maynard died before I was around, but...APPRAISER: What is the scene?GUEST: Well, it's called The Old Stage Station, and I really don't know very much about it. I'm thinking it was probably in Arizona, but I don't know.APPRAISER: Well, Maynard Dixon had a really interesting career. He was born in 1875, I believe, in California. And in the beginning of his career, up until the '20s, was a fairly commercial artist, and then after his marriage, actually, to Dorothea Lange, he decided to really break out, and that's in the '20s, when he did the fabulous western scenes with the Navajo and the Hopi Indians and the great, great expanses of the West. Uh, they write about Maynard Dixon as really understanding the space and the loneliness of the West, and in this later piece, I think we can see that, too. This is kind of where the interesting part of valuing a painting comes in. Maynard Dixon's great period, right now, is those great Native American scenes of the '20s, from the '20s...you know, 1920 to '29, these vast scenes. One recently sold for over a million dollars. They're estimated often between $300,000 and $600,000. Tremendously valuable paintings. As a later example of his work, I'd estimate the painting at between $30,000 and $50,000.GUEST: Well, thank you very much.APPRAISER: Thanks for coming.
