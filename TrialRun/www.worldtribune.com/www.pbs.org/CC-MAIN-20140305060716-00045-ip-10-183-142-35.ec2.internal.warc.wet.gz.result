Classroom Clips Morally Justified Killing (Clip 5 of 6)
In the fifth clip associated with the Soldiers of Conscience lesson plan, Maj. Pete Kilner argues that in particular situations, war is not only justified, it is the morally right situation. Human dignity, he explains, is worth nothing if it is not defended. Students should discuss whether it's morally justifiable to kill in combat. View lesson plan »
