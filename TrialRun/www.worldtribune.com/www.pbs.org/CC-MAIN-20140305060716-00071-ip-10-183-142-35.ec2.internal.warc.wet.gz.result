Scott October 4, 2011 at 4:45 PM ESTThe House of Representatives passed a stopgap spending measure Tuesday in a 352-66 vote, once again temporarily avoiding a government shutdown and potential backlash from voters.Speaker John Boehner and other House leaders gained support from 170 Democrats to ensure passage, a tactic that may become more the norm than the exception due to hardline conservatives’ opposition to spending levels.Last month, 48 Tea Party Republicans joined Democrats to hand House leaders an embarrassing defeat, causing the initial version of the continuing resolution, known as the CR, to be reworked to pass.This time around, House leaders said before the vote that would not happen. “I think you’ll find bipartisan support of the bill,” said Republican vote-counter, Kevin McCarthy of California.The CR, which cleared the Democratic-led Senate last week, funds the government through Nov. 18, but appears to be just another in a series of upcoming battles over spending in Washington. On the agenda are a large fiscal 2012 spending package that encompasses all appropriations bills, possible recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (known as the “Super Committee”), and a Senate-passed worker-retraining measure meant to accompany trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. Boehner faces possible conservative revolts when those trade pacts hit the House floor next week due to spending levels.Democrats say that there is an ongoing tug-of-war between House GOP leaders and rank-and-file conservatives that has dominated the legislative year, and that Speaker Boehner may become increasingly reliant on what some Democratic aides say may be an uncomfortable allegiance with Democrats to pass any major bills.“We voted on the CR because we think it’s good policy and appropriate,” said Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, “and we’re pleased that we ultimately have arrived at what could have been done two weeks ago without any drama or theater.” SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER PREVIOUS POSTResearch Linking Contraceptives to HIV Raises Policy QuestionsNEXT POST U.S. Angered by China, Russia Veto of Syria Resolution at U.N.

Attachment, Happiness
Being a mom feels like I’m riding a see-saw sometimes. There is family on one side and work on the other. Very rarely has this see-saw been horizontal and balanced for any length of time. Sometimes the weight of one side falls with a thump and at other times it may happen more slowly. While I talk about motherhood in this post I by no means want to suggest that this is only an issue that plagues women. A 21 yr-old single mother was recently arrested by the military for failure to deploy because her childcare plans for her 10-month-old fell through. I am not here to judge her or the military’s response as I am not privy to all the details. Was this poor planning on her part? Was the military excessively rigid? This story really hit me and sparked a wide range of thoughts and feelings. In discussing it with friends I realized that I was not alone in my reaction. If you ask most mothers “What is more important, work or family?” I would guess most would say family. But what does it mean to have your family come first. Is it measured by how many hours you spend together? Can it mean providing good opportunities for your children that may require long hours away and which may mean, in the case of the 21 yr old military mom, many months or years away?When we see stories like the military mom it is easy to make a caricature of each involved party. For me this story is a reminder that putting your family first can look many different ways. The military can provide educational opportunities and job security that this mom may not have been able to give her child in any other setting. Doing work that contributes to others can teach children the importance of service, sacrifice and selflessness. There is no one-size-fits-all way to parent and we each need to find a solution that works for our family. One day, at the playground, I began talking to a woman sitting next to me on the park bench. After talking for a while she asked me how long I had been a nanny. She had been doing this work for many years in order to send money back to her home country where her mother was raising her children. She assumed that because I speak Spanish that I too must be caring for someone else’s children. It got me thinking about how many men and women come to this country without their children in order to offer their kids a better life. My own parents came to this country before I was born. My mom left all she knew, all her family support and her native language to come live here because my father had always dreamed of living in the United States where “opportunities are endless.” Would it have been better to have been raised close to my extended family but in a country where my parents felt my future would be limited? Looking at the lives my brother and I lead today I feel grateful for the decision my parents made.So many of the patients I see struggle to find the perfect balance. Their anxiety is exacerbated by the belief that there actually even IS a perfect balance. They want to be the best parent and professional they can be. They “just know” that the solution to their “problem” is out there and it is just a matter of finding it. What I find myself saying to others, as well as to myself, is that often the solution to many of these problems is this: Accept there isn’t (or may never be) a solution and just enjoy the adventure on the playground.I realize that this post offers far more questions than it answers. As I balance motherhood and my professional life I remind myself that good enough has to be good enough. Or, in Voltaire’s words “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” I take store-bought cookies to the school party so I’m able to write a post or see patients the night before. I may not return a work call within the hour because I’m helping my kids do their homework. My conclusion is this: We can do it all (but just not at the same time.) I’d love to hear your thoughts, feelings and solutions. It not only takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to keep us from going nuts while doing so.

Himalayas Facts
View The Himalayas in a larger map
Name: Himalayas, Sanskrit for ‘abode of snow’
Geography: The Himalayas stretch across the northeastern portion of India. They cover approximately 1,500 mi (2,400 km) and pass through the nations of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Bhutan and Nepal. The Himalayan range is made up of three parallel ranges often referred to as the Greater Himalayas, the Lesser Himalayas, and the Outer Himalayas.
Ecology: While intimidating mountains like Everest and 2K tend to dominate our perceptions of the region, the Himalayas are rich in biodiversity. Climates range from tropical at the base of the mountains to perennial snow and ice at the highest elevations. These complex and diverse eco-regions are interconnected: an ecological threat to one is ultimately a threat to many. Here are just a few examples of Himalayan ecology:
Montane Grasslands and Shrublands:
Western alpine shrubs and meadows can be found between 9,850 and 16,400 ft. These areas tend to have cold winters and mild summers that allow for plant growth. Rhododendron plants cover the lower shrublands, while the alpine meadows, directly above, host a range of flora in the warmer months. Animals found in this region include the snow leopard, Himalayan tahr, musk deer, and pikas.
Temperate Coniferous Forest:
In the northeast, temperate sub-alpine conifer forests are found at elevations of 8,200 to 13,800 ft. Located in the inner valley area, these forests are protected from harsh monsoon conditions by surrounding mountain ranges. The dominant tree types are pine, hemlock, spruce, and fir. Animals found in this region include red pandas, takins, and musk deer.
Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests:
Found in middle elevations of 6,600 to 9,800 ft. in the eastern region are broadleaf and coniferous forests. These forests receive almost 80 inches of annual rainfall, mostly during the monsoon season. In addition to indigenous oaks and maples, plants like orchids, lichen, and ferns also grow in the area. A huge range of wildlife, including over 500 species of birds, are found here during the cooler seasons before they migrate to higher elevations to escape the hot summers. This is also the primary home for golden langur monkeys.
Tropical and Sub-tropical Broadleaf Forests:
Located at 1,650 to 3,300 ft. along a narrow strip of the outer Himalayan range are the Himalayan sub-tropical broadleaf forests. Here there is a wide range of plant life thanks to the areas varied topography, soil types, and rainfall levels. Forest types include subtropical dry evergreen, northern dry mixed deciduous forests, moist mixed deciduous forests, subtropical broadleaf forests, northern tropical semi-evergreen forests, and northern tropical wet evergreen forests. Wildlife includes many threatened species including tigers and Asian elephants. More than 340 different species of birds can be found in this region.
Highest peak: Mount Everest at 29,029 ft (8,848 m) is not only the highest peak in the Himalayas, but the highest peak on the entire planet.
Other famous peaks include Karakora (K2), Kailash, Kanchenjunga, Nanga Parbat, Annapurna, and Manasklu.
Rivers: The Himalayas are the source for the Indus, the Yangtze and the Ganga-Brahmaputra. All three are major river systems for the continent of Asia.
The main rivers sourced in Himalayas are the Ganges, Indus, Yarlung, Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong, and Nujiang.
Glaciers: The Himalayas are the third largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic. There are approximately 15,000 glaciers located throughout the range. At 48 miles (72 km) in length, the Himalayan Siachen glacier is the largest glacier outside the poles.
Other notable glaciers located in the Himalayas include the Baltoro, Biafo, Nubra, and Hispur.
Additional Facts:
The Himalayas are the result of tectonic plate motions that collided India into Tibet.
Because of the great amount of tectonic motion still occurring at the site, the Himalayas have a proportionally high number of earthquakes and tremors.
The Himalayas are one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet.
The range affects air and water circulation systems, impacting the weather conditions in the region.
The Himalayas cover approximately 75% of Nepal.
Serving as a natural barrier for tens of thousands of years, the range prevented early interactions between the people of India and the people of China and Mongolia.
Mt. Everest was named after Colonel Sir George Everest, a British surveyor who was based in India during the early-to-mid-nineteenth century.
The Nepalese call Mt. Everest “Samgarmatha” which can be translated as “Goddess of the Universe” or “Forehead of the Sky.”
In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay were the first people to successfully climb to the summit of Everest.
Despite its name, the Snow Leopard – a Himalayan local – is actually most closely related to the Tiger.

Scanning a telescopic map of the Himalayan mountains, I came across a colorful section called the Khumjungar. It showed a beautiful mix of teal blue, dark blue and pink. What causes this variation of color? Could it be the pink crystal salts that I’ve heard about that come from these mountains?
