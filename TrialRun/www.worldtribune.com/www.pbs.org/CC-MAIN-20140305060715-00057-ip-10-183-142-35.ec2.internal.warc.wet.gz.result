Evolution: Humans: Babies by Design
Should We Create Babies By Design?
"Would you like a blue-eyed or a brown-eyed baby? Is Alzheimer's in your family? We can screen for that. And obesity? We'll see what we can do." In the not-too-distant future, doctors might routinely ask such questions of expectant parents. They might even alter the genes of a developing fetus and create, in effect, custom-made babies. But should they? Like no other species on Earth, we humans can influence what genes and traits are passed on to future generations -- and thereby impact the course of our evolution. Will our power to manipulate human heredity lead us down a dangerous path? Explore what the future may hold, and ask yourself ... Do the benefits of new genetic tools outweigh the risks?

Ancient Creature of the Deep
Program Overview
NOVA chronicles the discovery of a "living fossil," a fish called the coelacanth that has remained relatively unchanged since prehistoric times.
The program:
recalls Darwin's prediction that some creatures would have not undergone any major adaptations due to selective pressures and would have remained relatively the same since prehistoric times.
relates the 1938 discovery of the coelacanth off the coast of South Africa by Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer.
tells the story of J.L.B. Smith, the scientist who identified Courtenay-Latimer's specimen as a coelacanth.
notes that many anatomical features of coelacanths have changed little since the Devonian period 400 million years ago.
examines the fossil record of the coelacanth.
relates the discovery of coelacanths around the Comoros Islands and near Indonesia.
compares the coelacanth to sharks and other types of fishes.
discusses the significance of the coelacanth in the study of evolution.
