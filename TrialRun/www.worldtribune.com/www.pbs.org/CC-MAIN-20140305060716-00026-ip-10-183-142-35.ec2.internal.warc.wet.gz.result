Medeiros, 38, is a defense attorney in private practice in Boston and also takes court appointed cases for indigent clients. Prior to her legal career, she spent nine years in the U.S. Navy, leaving in 1993 with the rank of Lieutenant, Surface Warfare Qualified Unrestricted Line Officer (meaning she was
qualified to take command of a ship.) (Watch a 5:00 video excerpt showing Medeiros working a case.)
How did you get into this career?
When I was in high school, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer, but didn't have the
grades. I graduated at the bottom of my class. I didn't have the family
support. I didn't have money or any way to get to college. I didn't even know
what law school was. [I grew up in] Framingham, Massachusetts. I wasn't doing well in high school
because I was in a really bad family environment. My mother was an alcoholic,
my father was absent, I had six sisters. We lived in a low income housing
project, cockroach infested. I was [partying] and doing all kinds of things I
shouldn't have been doing, when I was in high school. I had my focus on other
things, not on school. So I just messed up. But I thought I was smart, and I
knew I wanted to do something some day. . . And when I was 17, I enlisted in the
Navy because I [had heard about how they would pay for you to ] go to school. . .
I spent almost 5 years enlisted. [I] got out, and then got rejected from all kinds of really crummy colleges, and finally got into a community college. And I did
really well with grades, surprisingly to everybody. And then I was able to
transfer to UMass, Boston.
. . .
Did the Navy help you in getting through that and getting to where you are
now? Absolutely. You know, I never had a curfew. I could [come home]--and at 12
years old--any time I wanted, because my mother wasn't there. . . I didn't
ever have any limits. And when I went in the Navy, I remember the very first
day in boot camp, somebody told me to sweep the floor. I'm like, "I'm not
sweeping any floor. You can go take a hike." And they took me in this room,
and they explained to me, "Look, you can make it hard on yourself, or you can
use your head and do what we say and make it easy on yourself." And at that
point I said, "Oh, I get it." You know. "They're going to make me feel
miserable, so I might as well just go with the program." But that was probably
the first time I ever did what somebody told me to do, when I was 17 years
old. . . So I think that it gave me a sense of limits and discipline and
boundaries and respect maybe for authority, which I didn't have before then. . . [And it helped me] figure out how to work within a system. With my clients, I
often say to them when they get on probation and they're screwing up, "You need
to play the game. You're going to make it hard on yourself if you don't do
what they tell you to do on probation. So even though you don't want to do
it, and you don't think you should have to do it, just do it, for yourself."
And that's, I think, what I did. I didn't do it because they were telling me
to. I think I realized, "You got to do this to make it easy on yourself." So
the Navy was great for me, just what I needed. And it also gave me [a sense of self-confidence]. The first job I did was this
stupid little job driving these boats in the Philippines. When I was 18 years
old, I got sent over there. I was really good at it. And it was a hard job.
And all the guys couldn't do it. We moved big barges and ships with our boats,
like tugboats. . . I would hook up my little boat to this huge barge, and be
able to maneuver it up alongside a ship, perfectly aligned. The guys would
have to call my boat to help them with tough jobs when it was windy. It killed
them, because they never thought a woman should be there. But that gave me
self-esteem for the first time in my life. How did you end up in law school?
I got out of the Navy in 1985 to go to college. [After I graduated from
college at UMass], I still wanted to go to law school. In fact, I tried to
apply to law school at that point. But . . . I didn't really have any
letters of recommendation from anybody. I didn't have the money. So I turned
to the Navy again. And I was an officer on a ship. When I came on that ship, it
was a huge, huge issue, because I was the first one there. Four hundred
men.
Four hundred men and you the only woman?
Yes, but that was just for a couple of months. They were starting to bring
more women on. . . . The year women came on, that was when the
Tailhook thing happened, and we were having this huge issue on the ship about
how to adjust to women. Because the men were so used to having this little
haven, when they went on deployments . . . and now all of a sudden there's
women on board, ruining their old boys' network. . . But I thought that the ship
handled things pretty well. . . And, I had prejudices too, and needed to deal
with them. Being with all men was something I had to adjust to. So I never
really felt like they were hostile, or I never felt threatened. Nobody ever
grabbed me or anything like that. But we all had to adjust.
And how did you finally get to law school?
I was on the ship for about 3 years. And I really wanted to go to law school.
So I applied, and told the captain and the executive officer that I wanted to
be considered for an early out, because I had a year left in the Navy, but
since I got accepted to law school, I'd need to get out like four months early.
And they were so encouraging and so helpful and so supportive. So I got
accepted to a great school, University of California at Hastings.
It was so hard, because I always had this big insecurity that I had come from a
different place than all these people that had learned how to study. . . So I
think that I was so scared that I just wasn't good enough and that I was going
to fail. So I just studied all the time. I worked so hard, and I still only
graduated in the middle of the class, swimming as hard as I could swim, just
going as hard as I could. And then how did you get into doing defense work?
I always wanted to be a prosecutor. . . So I came back to Massachusetts, not
knowing anybody. . . But to be a prosecutor--it's political. I was so
frustrated. I applied to every single prosecutor's office. Rejection,
rejection, rejection. And I remember going up to Ralph Martin's office, out of
my frustration, because I knew that if I could just speak to him, or speak to
somebody in charge, I could convince them to hire me. But you can't get past
that wall. I remember going up to talk to his secretary and said, "I want to
talk to Ralph Martin." And she's like, "Well, what's your name? Do you have
an appointment?" "No. My name's Lisa Medeiros." So I remember sitting there,
and finally [after a long time] she's like, "Well, he's not going to be able to
see you." Why do you think you couldn't get in the door?
I think it's because who knows Lisa Medeiros? They all have favors that they
owe everybody, and that's how you get a job. Somebody calls up and says, "I
want you to hire my nephew, Bob Smith," and he gets hired. You know, it's so
incredible to me, because I'm looking at my resume with great law school, all
the things that I've done, the Navy and all my accomplishments, and they don't
even look at me. So it's not on merit. Can't be on merit, because I look at
all these young kids who are coming into the prosecutor's office, and they
don't have the self-confidence that I have gained over the years . . . But
anyway, I was frustrated. So at that point, I remember, I sent out letters just
desperately, to small law firms in Boston, saying, "If you'd let me write your
pesky little things that you can't pay attention to, if you have these little
legal issues"-- but I could not get a job. Nobody would hire me. I was
working as a temporary legal secretary through a temp agency, at a law firm in
Boston.
I always knew that something would happen, though. . . I sent out this
letter, and this one attorney called me and said, "You know, hey, I do criminal
defense. If you want to come over, I'll pay you." He paid me $7 an hour. So I
went over to work four hours a day, for $7 an hour. I didn't know how I was
going to pay my rent. . . And then it turned out I was doing pretty
good, and then he said, "Why don't you work full-time?" And then I was making
all of $250 a week, before taxes, just scraping by, paying my rent. But I
passed the bar. And he suggested that I try to get on the list [for
court-appointed defense work], which is the Bar Advocates, because he was on
the list. . . So I sent in my resume, and I think because they knew
his name, they called me in. And lo and behold, one of the guys . . . was a
military man, and so he loved the fact that I was in the Navy. So we swapped
war stories, and then I got on the list. And that's how it all started.
And then of course I didn't know what the heck I was doing. I'd just passed the
bar five months earlier, and then all of sudden I'm getting all these criminal
cases. And I'm like, "Well, what the heck?"
What kinds of cases were they?
District Court stuff. Stuff that I do now. Assault and batteries, and
possession of drugs, and receiving stolen property, operating after a suspended
license. Nothing too glamorous.
And you have a private practice now too?
Yes. You really can't make a living on the court-appointed stuff. It's
hard--$30 an hour, before taxes. And you have to have your own office and your
insurance and all that. . . So I take all kinds of cases now. I do
family law. I've learned all kinds of law. Personal injury, and sexual
harassment cases . . . How does that compare with prosecutors' salaries?
I think we probably make about the same. Court-appointed attorneys can max
out at $54,000 a year. They only let you take a certain amount of hours that
would equal $54,000. That's before taxes and before expenses. And the
prosecutors now are making . . . $35,000. They used to make $25,000. But
they don't have to pay for their office. They have supplies. So I think it
works out about the same. They think we're making all kinds of money. . . .
The difference is that I can do that court-appointed stuff part-time, and then
make all kinds of money on big cases that they can't do. I might get a big
personal injury case. I did a wrongful death, and I got $12,000 for doing not
too much. So that's where it balances out, I think.
How would you describe your relationship with prosecutor?
I think, really good. With any prosecutor and defense attorney, we're
adversaries. And it's really hard to be friends. We don't go out for a beer
or anything. I always invite them to my parties, and they never come. But I
never expect them to come. But I always invite them. But I go to their
goodbye parties and hello parties for new prosecutors in the courts that I work
in, in East Boston and Roxbury. But there's never any other defense attorneys
there. There's a real division, because it's hard to be friendly with somebody
that you're fighting with in court.
Or maybe does it have something to do with the kinds of people who are
attracted to the different sides?
Well, no. I think that there's a wide spectrum of people who become
prosecutors, and a wide spectrum of people who become defense attorneys. And I
think that there are some defense attorneys that are just the rabid ones, that
are way out on the left and never can see anything; some prosecutors that are
way over on the right. But there are a whole bunch of prosecutors in the
middle, and a whole bunch of defense attorneys in the middle, that probably
could be friends with each other if they were on the same side. And I think
that's where most of the people are. The ones on the left, or way on the
right, are the ones that stick out, that you remember. But they're not the
majority. . . Do you feel both sides confront the same constraints? Not enough resources,
overwhelming case loads?
I probably would say we have it easier on the defense side. I mean, as far as
resources and all that stuff, and caseload, we're all over-burdened. . .
But the difference between the prosecutors and my side is that the prosecutors
have to answer for everything they do to their boss. When I make a decision
about my case, I don't have anyone else to answer to. They're thinking, "All
right, if I offer this guy 6 months, my boss is going to have a heart attack."
And I think that's a big pressure. So they can't really evaluate the case and
deal with the case as they see fit. They have to be worried about what's going
to happen when they go back upstairs with their stats. And I think that that's
a big difference in the pressure of the job.
So you're more independent.
I have to answer to the client. But you know what? Most of the clients will
blindly follow you. The film shows that there are those cases where it seems hard to get the
client to actually make their own decision. You're so right. I keep saying, "I'll tell you what your choices are, but it is
your decision." And usually I can get them to make a decision. But you know,
what they do is, they just want me to make it, most of them. And so what
they'll often do is listen to my cues. Even if I'm not conscious of it,
probably subconsciously I will tell them in a certain way, and it will come
across that I think it's the thing to do. I don't mean to, but probably it
comes across.
So how do you balance having your own opinion and advising them of that, and
still letting them make their own decisions?
Well, I think for me, what I like to do is, I want them to make their own
decisions, but I don't want to be on the hook if they go to jail. I think my
job is just to make sure they understood what all their options were,
completely. And once I feel comfortable that they understand that, I've
explained all the choices and then they made one of those choices,
understanding what the possible consequences were, then I'm okay with whatever
happens. . . Sometimes I have to make the choice for them. But I try not to
do that.
It's a big responsibility.
Yes, but sometimes, too, some of the people are, not that they're not
intelligent, but they're so used to people telling them what to do, because
that's the society they live in. They don't really make decisions for
themselves a lot. Many just have been told what to do all their lives. You go
to school. You don't go to school, you go to jail. When you go to jail,
you're told what to do. You get your welfare check . . . They don't [often
have] jobs. They just are used to people making decisions for them, and they're
comfortable with that. I wish that it wasn't like that. And if I can force
them to make a decision, I try really hard. But if they can't, then I come to
a point where I have to say, "Okay, this is what I think you should do."
Can a client get another attorney, if they don't want you?
No. Judges don't like to do that, and I don't blame them, because you're not
supposed to be able to pick your court-appointed attorney. If you want to hire
an attorney, you can hire anybody you want, and you can fire them seven days a
week, and go hire somebody else. But when the state is providing an
attorney--you really need to take what you get. But that's part of our job, to deal with difficult people. And on the days
that I can't deal with them, sometimes what I'll do is, I need to walk away.
Because some days, I come in, in a crummy mood, and you're putting me over the
edge by giving me a hard time. And some days, I just can't deal with it very
well. But when I think about it, it's these people's lives. When I look at
their lives, I think, I come home to my little house, and how privileged I am,
and I have to understand, they're coming in from some probably crummy apartment
like the one that I grew up in, and they're coming to court. And I can say,
"Man, their lives are just. . ." It's a whole different dimension. And I know
what it's like to live in that world. And it's not nice. And you live it
every day. And I'm just there for 8 hours. Is that what keeps you going--that you can see that?
I think that's part of it. I think that I can really understand. I would be
in a crummy mood if I was coming to court for a case. Their problems are so
great. I mean, a lot of them have AIDS and drug addictions and children who
don't live with them, and then they come in for this case where they might go
to jail. And so, no wonder they're angry. And they're angry at me because I'm
the system. And I can understand that.
[And] you know what? They're not all like that. Some of them are really,
really sweet people. And not often do I get a "thank you," but once in a
while, somebody will call me up and say, "I just wanted to thank you. You did
such a good job." And I'll think, wow! I've gotten cards, little tiny gifts,
or a little something, you know, saying the impact that I made on their lives,
or how important it was to them because they knew I cared. That keeps me
going. So maybe, again like the stereotypes, the ones that you pay attention
to are the ones that are making you angry because they're being really mean,
but probably 90% of them are nice people, just in a bad situation.
What do you think about the tv legal dramas, like Law and
Order and The Practice? Do you watch those
shows? Do any of the practicing lawyers?
No, I don't. Yes, most lawyers do. And they always say, "Oh, did you see
The Practice last night, or Ally McBeal?" One of the guys
calls always calls me Ally McBeal, over at the courthouse. He doesn't call me
anything else. And I don't even know what he's talking about. All I know is,
she weighs about 100 pounds less than me. That's all I know. But yes, they
all watch it. Do you think it's unrealistic?
Partially. I just don't like to watch courtroom shows outside of work because
it reminds me of work. It makes me think like, "I should have filed that
motion," or "I should have done this," or "I should have done that." It just
gets me going with my little anxieties. So I think that's part of the reason
why I don't them. But I think they're pretty popular among the lawyers.
On all those shows it seems that the defense attorney never wants to know
if the person is guilty. Is that true? Do you want to know if your clients did
what they're charged with? The answer to that is really going to strike you funny, but I don't care. And
let me tell you why I don't care. . . I think at first, when I first started
doing this job, I wanted to know if they were guilty or innocent. But then I
came to realize that it doesn't matter to me, because I'm not the judge. My
job is not to judge them and to decide if they're innocent or guilty. Because
they can tell me their story all day long, and they might sound as guilty as
sin, but you know what? They might not be. . . So if I were to adopt that
belief and say, "Well, he must be guilty," then I think that I would present a
different defense. So what I do is, I look at the case and think, "How can I
beat the case?" It doesn't matter if he did it or not. How can I beat this
case? And so when I size up a case, sometimes I don't even want to hear the
client's side, because what I got to do is just beat the police report,
basically. Since the police are going to say this, I have to find the way to
show that what they're saying, or what they thought they saw, isn't what really
happened. And so a lot of times the client's story doesn't help me. Most of them did it. That's the hard, cold truth. If they're in the system,
probably most of them did something close to what they're accused of. And a
lot of times too, if you really do listen to all the stories, what the police
say, what the victims say, what the defendants say, the truth is somewhere in
the middle of that. It's really not what the police say they think that they
saw, because people see things through their own eyes. You know how they say
eyewitnesses' accounts can be completely different? Same person sees something
and they're all giving different views? And that's just the police report and
the defendant's story. Somewhere in between is what happened. But my job is
just to win. But part of it's just about me, too. I like to win. And I just
don't care if they did it or not.
But there must be some instances where, just as a human being, if it's
something particularly heinous, you must be curious: Did this person really do
this horrible thing?
Well, if I get to that point--and there was one case that I turned away--that I
have to decide, did this person do this horrible thing, then I'm afraid that I
can't represent them to the best of my ability. And the person that I turned
away was accused of sexually molesting his daughter. And when he told me what
he had done, he described it to me, and then told me he didn't see why it was a
crime. And after speaking to him, I thought, "There is no way I can represent
this man. It just is too much for me." I think it was okay for me to represent
him until the point where he told me he just didn't understand why it was a
crime. And there's a chance I could have gotten him set free. I don't really
know because I said, "I just can't take this case," because I was disturbed. I
was really disturbed by it. I have represented a couple of people accused of rape, but I really didn't
think they did it. And maybe a part of me makes me believe that, to represent
them. I don't know. But I didn't think these people did it, and I was able to
represent them, and everything turned out okay. So maybe when I get into
bigger cases, I might have more of a conflict. But you know, I'm mostly
practicing in the District Court, where most of my clients are [charged with]
drug [offenses]. And it's not a big deal to me if someone's shooting crack
into their arm or whatever they're doing. I don't care. And it's all about
trying to get them another chance, and maybe they'll turn around, maybe not.
Maybe they'll pick up another case and go to jail on somebody else's time. But
these kind of crimes aren't things that I just hate. I see them as victims,
the people I represent right now. . . What is the balance of your caseload, in terms of court-appointed cases and
private work?
It varies. I can regulate it. When I have a lot of private stuff, I can cut
down on the court-appointed by taking less duty days. And when I'm lean on the
private stuff, I'll take more court-appointed. So right now, last month I was
lean on the private stuff. This year has been really good for me with private,
so I was doing 50-50. But just the last month, all of a sudden all my private
cases are wrapping up and I haven't got anything new. So now I'm trying to
pick up more court-appointed. Maybe it's 75-20 now.
So you'd rather do private work?
I never want to give up the court-appointed stuff. If I could make a living on
the court-appointed stuff, if I could really pay my bills and my loans and
everything, that's what I would do. I wouldn't do another thing. Because I
like the people. I like the work. I like the pace. But isn't it similar work?
Well, no. When I talk about my private stuff, a lot of it is not criminal.
It's family law, divorces, child custody, discrimination, sexual harassment,
personal injury, car accidents, contract work, all kinds of lawsuits . . . I
get some private criminal [work], but you know what? I really think that
there's a prejudice. Some people would disagree with me, but I think there's a
prejudice in favor of the big-time [lawyers], especially among people that are
dealing drugs, like a lot of money. They want a white male attorney with a
downtown office. And that's who they think is going to get them off. So
they're not coming to me.
Do you think that's a fair prejudice?
No, because I think I would do as good a job as they could. Absolutely. I
know I could. And probably better. . . But I get some interesting
cases, like assault with intent to murder. I get some referrals for those kind
of cases. And they don't seem to mind that I'm a woman. As long as somebody
refers me to them, then they feel comfortable. But I can't get the
traffickers, the drug traffickers. I think they want the white, male, downtown
lawyers. I think that's the word on the street.
Do you feel very over-worked?
No, because I can really cut corners. I can handle a case one way or handle it
another way, and still handle it very, very competently, if I don't file a
zillion motions, and then if I do file a zillion motions.
When do you decide how much work you're comfortable with?
I think that it all happens as it happens. Because sometimes I'd love to do
more on a case but I just simply can't. Like the jury trial where the judge
says, "Shouldn't you have done this?" Well, yeah, I should have, and I just
couldn't. So sometimes you just can't do things. I would like to prepare for
my direct examination or my opening, but I can't because I've got three motions
to suppress the day before. So I guess the way that I decide is how busy I am,
but also [it depends on what I think my chances are]. Like I have a pretty good
trial that's going to happen on Tuesday. I'm going to go to the office tonight
about 5:00, and I'm going to work on that, because I think it's going to
happen, and I think I can win it. I guess, if I think that there's a chance,
then I'm going to give it more work. . .
In terms of the court-appointed cases, how often would you say you end up
pleading cases out? Oh, I'd say 95%. No, let me say less, because a lot of dismissals happen
too. When I was thinking about cases that go to trial, probably 5% to 10%
actually go to trial. But you get a lot of dismissals, for whatever reasons.
You know, cops don't show up, or you win a motion, or something like that. So
maybe I plead out, maybe I would say 60%.
What are the factors that make you plead?
Well, if you've got a case that you're just not going to win. If I got a case
where the cops saw my guy pounding in the face of his girlfriend, and she's
going to testify against him with her broken nose, and the cops are going to
say, "Yeah, I saw him do that," and then they're going to introduce the medical
records, and the DA's offering him 18 months, then why take that to trial and
risk two years? So it depends on the case, if you've got a loser. And
also, sometimes there's a situation where they've got a long record and they're
on probation in another court. And maybe the case isn't so solid, but if you
plead this one out, you can work it with the other case so that they're
guaranteed no jail time. Basically you just want to keep them out of jail.
Most of the guys that [I'm working with], you just want to keep them out of
jail. So you just finagle. . . Is there advice you'd want to give to young lawyers?
Oh, my gosh, no. Definitely not. I wouldn't think anybody would want to
operate the way that I do.
Why?
Because I think that the way that I operate is kind of fly-by-night. I don't
really see myself as being very proficient, I just kind of am able to get
through it, and get through it pretty well, for some reason. But I think it's
partially because of my personality, the whole combination of who I am. So for
me to give advice, I wouldn't think anybody should operate like this. . .
But it works for you.
It works for me. That would actually be a great piece of advice. You can't
adopt anyone else's style. When I see lawyers trying, especially during an
opening or a closing, somebody that's soft-spoken trying to yell, you can't do
that. You have to find your own style, and you have to believe in yourself and
operate from that perspective. Don't ever try to do anyone else's style.
Did it take you a while to develop a style, or to become comfortable?
No. Well, I was always so petrified, I couldn't even speak in court. I
really had a problem with public speaking when I first started this job. I
would sit there and say, "When they call your name, you have to get up. You
have to get up. Don't be frozen." I thought I'd be frozen in the seat. And I
still get scared now. But I think that part of the thing that I had going for
me was that I had a certain presence about me, or I exuded a presence even
though I wasn't feeling it. I think I'm very aggressive, and I think that part
of my style is that I exude this confidence that I may not be feeling, but that
I think other people around me think, "Hey, she must be saying something that's
true, because look at how she's saying it." So I think that was just a natural
thing that maybe came from my being an officer in the Navy, because they talk
about military bearing all the time, and they make you stand up straight and
walk a certain way and talk a certain way.
And I call judges "sir." Some judges say, "You make me feel old," but I do
that because I was so trained at such a young age. And I think that part of it
is, I fall into that military kind of persona. So I think that's where my
style comes from.
How do you see your career evolving?
See, it's so hard for me, because it took me 17 years to get from that point
when I was in high school to the point when I graduated law school. Seventeen
years. . . . I've changed careers and changed positions and places where
I've lived, so much in my life. I really can't see myself doing this for
another five years. But the problem is that I always had this vision of going
to law school, and I always had this focus, and that was my goal. Suddenly I
reached it, and my vision stopped. So where do I go from here? I don't know.
In five years, I'd like to be doing something else.
Not law? Or just not this criminal trial stuff?
Probably not court-appointed stuff. I hate to say it because it makes me a
little sad, because this has really been so enjoyable. But I think I'd be
sadder if I were still doing this in five years.
Because you'd be burnt out, or because you just would feel like you weren't
progressing?
Both. When I first started this court-appointed stuff in the District Court, I
was petrified. I didn't know what I was doing. I was up all hours. Now I can
have a jury trial and I can walk in there without even reading the police
report, and I can do a pretty good job. I mean, you don't want to do that.
That's not what you should do. But it's just, I kind of got it. I got it
now.
I need to be challenged a little bit more, because when I'm not challenged, I'm
not investing as much of myself into it, and they're not getting as much
benefit, whoever I'm working with. But there's got to be something else, I
hope, but I just have no vision yet. Would you ever want to be a DA?
. . . I could. I'm not sure if I would want to at this point, only because I
really have realized, since being on this side, that this is where I needed to
be. My mind is probably more of a prosecutor's mind.
What is that?
You got to take responsibility for what you do. If you're going to go out
there and play the game, then when it comes time to pay the price, you got to
stand up to the plate. You know, I hate it when these guys are crying when
they're going to jail. It's like, "You know what? It caught up with you."
And I know that I've been in certain positions in my life where I've had to pay
the price for things that I've done. And I did it like a grown woman. And I
think that that's what you have to do. You have to pay the price and accept
the consequences for things that happen. And I think that's what a
prosecutor's job is, a lot of times. So I could definitely be a prosecutor.
But I [also] realize that I like to have the freedom and my own individual
thought process and ability to be able to make decisions. . . . I don't
want some boss telling me, "Well, you know what? You shouldn't have given him
6 months on that one." I say, "But you know, I evaluated the case, and I
know what I did was right." That would be a problem for me. So I don't know
what's going to happen, but I really hope that I make some changes. And I'm
trying to. . . home |

Iraq Elections
January 28, 2005	BOB ABERNETHY, anchor: As Iraqis this Sunday elect a new parliament, to write a new constitution, a look now at the role of religion in that process.
Fawaz Gerges is professor of international affairs and Middle Eastern studies at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. Welcome.
Dr. FAWAZ GERGES (Professor, International Affairs and Middle Eastern Studies, Sarah Lawrence College): Thank you.
ABERNETHY: The Shiite Muslims, 60 percent of the people in Iraq, are widely expected to get a majority in the election — in the new parliament. What will that mean about the role of religion in a new government?
Dr. GERGES: Well, leading Shiite clerics have tried to reassure Iraqis that they will not publicly lead the new Iraqi government. But I believe that Shiite clerics will play a prominent role behind the scenes, as the most powerful cleric, Ali Sistani, has been doing since the American invasion and occupation of Iraq.
ABERNETHY: Meanwhile, you and others have written that in Iraq, and perhaps all over the Middle East, at the popular level, the street level, people are becoming more religiously conservative — more Islamist. What does that mean?
Dr. GERGES: Well, Islamists are political activists who would like to create a state based on Islamic law. What we are witnessing in Iraq, Bob, is that social space in Iraq is becoming Islamicized by the day. In the last two decades, Iraqi society has become Islamicized from the bottom up as opposed to from the top down.
ABERNETHY: So the combination of what’s going on among the people and the clerics would indicate what for a new government and a new constitution?
Dr. GERGES: Well, even though the new government will not be led by clerics, I believe that writing the new constitution will be much more important than the new government. As you know, Bob, leading Shiite and Sunni clerics were very unhappy, as you know, with the so-called interim constitution written under Paul Bremer. And this is why I believe in the new constitution, Sunni and Shiite clerics will give religion a more prominent role and will try — the constitution will be more conservative, more rigid, and will roll back the rights of women, which gained under the interim constitution.
ABERNETHY: I wanted to ask you about that. Specifically, what would that kind of constitution and government mean for women, for minorities?
Dr. GERGES: Well, it will mean that women will not be able to play a prominent role in public life. It will mean that the educational structure will be more conservative. It will mean less tolerance for dissent and for minorities, including women.
ABERNETHY: And what about Christians in Iraq? There are a few left there. What’s going on with them?
Dr. GERGES: The Christians represent about 3 percent of the population. But what we are witnessing today is a very tragic chapter: exodus of Christians on large scales. Tens of thousands of Christians are fleeing to Jordan, to Syria, to the West because they are being targeted by militant Islamists and Jihadists: Allah Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi, the militant Jordanian, and Ansar al-Sunna, and others.
ABERNETHY: Time’s up, I’m sorry. Many thanks to Fawaz Gerges of Sarah Lawrence College.
