What did you think of that, Mark?MARK SHIELDS, Syndicated Columnist: I would say it was — to be trite, I guess, a star was born. I think that the old line that freshmen should be seen and not heard was totally repealed and revoked. He spoke forcefully. He spoke from his own credentials.He spoke, as he did during the campaign, quoting Andrew Jackson, “We should measure the health of our society not at its apex, but at its base,” about the income disparity and income inequality in the country, how it’s grown and continues to grow.And then he just confronted the president directly. The president took us into this war recklessly, and the consequences were paid in terms of isolation. I thought it was a strong, tough statement, and surprising in its intensity.JIM LEHRER: Surprisingly strong in intensity?DAVID BROOKS, Columnist, New York Times: Not for Jim Webb. I mean, this is the guy who wouldn’t have a civil conversation with President Bush in the White House.MARK SHIELDS: I’ve talked to Jim Webb about that, and I’ll be happy to give you his side of the story.DAVID BROOKS: Well, it was intense. And it was writerly; it was eloquent; and it was forceful. But you can forget everything I just said about setting Iraq aside and having some bipartisanship.There wasn’t a hint of bipartisanship in this speech. There wasn’t a hint of, “Well, we can disagree on this, but we can agree on this.” That was out the window. This was a very confrontational speech.But a speech that was, from its point of view, a very forcefully written, forcefully executed. And I think it did establish a few things that are part of the Democratic Party and part of Jim Webb’s persona.First, the emphasis on the new populism, on economic populism, which Jim Webb represents, which is a different from Bill Clinton’s economic policy and Hillary Clinton’s Democratic policies.And, second, what the Democrats are hoping to establish, one, a strong military background. Jim Webb was a war hero, and his family has a strong background on that. But combined with that, quick exit from Iraq. Not capping the troops, as Hillary Clinton wants, not just halting the surge and then seeing, but quick exit from Iraq.And that I think is, for the Democratic Party, is not the unanimous position of the party, but is becoming — was pushed forward tonight by the speech.JIM LEHRER: Do you agree, the party got pushed forward on Iraq tonight?MARK SHIELDS: I think that Jim Webb — we don’t separate the message from the messenger in American politics. And he is, as David said it, because of his own credentials, his own history, he’s a very effective messenger, a strong messenger. So I think the message is reinforced. And I think he made it.And linking it to Eisenhower and Korea was something that hadn’t been done before, that a great American military hero of World War II said that bloody stalemate there was going nowhere, and it ended it, that we are not stronger because of Iraq. And I think that was the centerpiece of his argument. As a consequence of our going into Iraq, the United States is not stronger and more secure tonight.JIM LEHRER: Likely to have any impact? Because usually responses to State of the Union addresses have little or no impact. What about this one?DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think it will. I think, as Mark said, a star was born. I think it was way above average, just as a speech. I think it was way above average for a speech.And it will rally I think a lot of people, a lot of Democrats, especially who didn’t like the atmosphere in the room, who want a more confrontational tone. They will say, “Jim Webb is the guy. We can guarantee he will be forceful, and will rebut it, and has the personal life story to do that.”JIM LEHRER: David, Mark, thank you both very much.MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.JIM LEHRER: And for all evening.

NOVA scienceNOW
Go for a deep-sea dive with a marine biologist who is seeing things never before recorded on the ocean floor. Edie Widder studies marine bioluminescence, the biochemical emission of light by ocean animals. Bioluminescent animals can light up the murky depths, and Widder is doing some lighting of her own with an innovative camera system called the "Eye in the Sea." It uses a wavelength of light invisible to sea creatures to catch them unawares.
Widder's research and innovation of new technologies have won her a MacArthur "genius" grant, which will help support her work at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association, an organization she cofounded. Her passion for studying marine life is matched by her drive to help ensure its conservation and the health of marine ecosystems worldwide.

PROFILE: EDITH WIDDER
PBS Airdate: July 23, 2008
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: The bottom of the
ocean is a dark and secretive place. But if you come down here to take a look
around, once you turn on a light, of course, all the interesting stuff
disappears.
Well,
in this episode's profile, we'll meet one of the world's most determined
undersea spies, who's engineering new and ingenious ways to behold the
mysteries of the deep.
She's
clearly a woman on the go. And when her feet are not firmly on the ground,
she's perfecting her sea legs out here.
Edie
Widder is a marine biologist and explorer. Her quest? To understand ocean
creatures and help save their undersea world.
EDIE
WIDDER: I think I have the best job in the world.
Seventy-one percent of the planet is covered by water, we've explored less than
five percent of the ocean, and there are so many fabulous discoveries that have
yet to be made.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: She's working on
discovering how animals communicate using light. It's called bioluminescence. EDIE
WIDDER: They use it to attract food, to ward off predators,
to attract mates. It's vital to their existence. NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: But there's a
problem. There are only two ways to study these creatures, in their environment
or in ours. Both have their limitations. Bringing them up, well, they're not
exactly themselves. Going to them in a submersible also has its drawbacks.
SOeNKE
JOHNSEN: It's got lights flashing, motors
whirring. And then you come up to some animal, five inches away, and say, you
know, "Act natural." And it's not going to happen.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: So Edie came up
with a new kind of camera she calls the "Eye in the Sea." It's basically a
highly sensitive waterproof security camera on a timer. Its lights are red,
which most underwater creatures cannot see.
To
entice animals in front of the camera, Edie uses smelly fish guts inside a bait
box and an electronic light show that mimics the way certain animals attract
prey. PETER
GIRGUIS (Harvard University): There is no doubt that Edie is at the forefront of
her field. And this is, again, sort of a tribute to her capacity as a scientist
and, let's say, her closet engineering tendencies. NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: The Eye gets
dropped off on the ocean floor, via submersible. Today, Edie is deploying it in
the Bahamas. EDIE
WIDDER: So we're just looking for a nice flat piece of
terrain that we can set it down on safely. PHIL: Topside, our depth is 1,585, one, five, eight, five feet.
We're going to attempt to deploy it here.
EDIE
WIDDER: Now, you've got to let go at the right moment.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: New revelations pop
up every time Edie uses it.
EDIE
WIDDER: The payoffs have been huge. I mean, every time we
put this thing down, we see something nobody's ever seen before. NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: In the Gulf of
Mexico, the Eye recorded an amazing first: a squid, over six feet long, that is
so new to science, it cannot be placed in any known family.
EDIE
WIDDER: I screamed so loud; and I'm not a screamer. But I
was just wild. I couldn't believe it.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: Most recently, the
Eye revealed previously unknown feeding behavior of six-gilled sharks.
EDIE
WIDDER: They were doing something nobody's ever seen before.
They were rooting on the bottom and apparently sucking up, in the sand, these
little pill bugs, these isopods. And it's a possible explanation for how these
behemoths survive in what seems like a desert sometimes. NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: The Eye has allowed
marine biologists to study creatures only a mother could love, or a human like
Edie. She's been drawn to other species since she was a kid. EDIE
WIDDER: I loved anything to do with animals from a very
early age.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: School, on the
other hand, wasn't quite as much fun.
EDIE
WIDDER: I was so bored that I just tuned out everything that
was being said.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: Then Edie got a new
lease on learning. Her parents, both mathematics professors, whisked her away
on a magical globetrotting adventure. First stop: Europe. EDIE
WIDDER: ...went to all these magnificent art museums, and I
decided I wanted to be an artist. Then we went to Egypt, and I decided I wanted
to be an archeologist. And then we went to Australia and saw all of these
fabulous animals, and I decided I had to be a biologist.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: One of the last
stops? A fateful trip to the teeming reefs in Fiji.
EDIE
WIDDER: I just was mesmerized by all of this life everywhere
I looked. And so I wanted to be a marine biologist.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: Edie had found her
element. EDIE
WIDDER: So the family joke is, "If we'd gone from west to
east instead of east to west, would I have ended up as an artist?" But I think
the total lack of talent might have been somewhat of a drawback.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: And then she found
a soul mate. She was in high school, when she caught husband Dave's eye.
DAVE
SMITH (Edie Widder's Husband): There was an assembly, and I was sitting in there,
and I saw her come down the aisle with some of her girlfriends. And she was
wearing a leather skirt. And she just looked really hot. She was definitely
fantasy stuff.
EDIE
WIDDER: I think the leather skirt is a figment of his
imagination. But, okay, we'll keep it in the mythology.
But
he was a boy with a brain. He was the first one I'd ever met. Then one of my
girlfriends pointed out to me, "Wow, he's got great shoulders." Shoulders? Really?
And so we started dating. And I hate to admit it, but I married the first boy I
ever dated.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: And they lived
happily ever after...well, almost.
EDIE
WIDDER: It turns out my poor husband gets seasick if there's
a heavy dew on the lawn. In fact, he has declared he will never be going to sea
with me again. NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: That's okay.
There's lots for him to do on land. Dave's an expert in high tech instruments
and is pitching in with Edie's newly-founded Ocean Research & Conservation
Association, ORCA.
EDIE
WIDDER: You were talking about storm water runoff. You have
to have that meteorological data. A
lot of what we want to do with our new organization is make people aware of the
value of the ocean for our existence on this planet.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: To do this, Edie
came up with another invention she calls Kilroy. It's a monitoring device
equipped with sensors that can track salinity, temperature, wave height,
direction and speed of the current.
EDIE
WIDDER: We can send out commands to it as well as receive
information from it.
NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: To send the data
back to shore, Kilroy just makes a call, via standard cell phone technology.
They'll keep adding sensors, including some that will measure certain
pollutants. EDIE
WIDDER: And suddenly, now, we're starting to understand what's
going on. So it's not just this placid blue surface that...everything looks
fine. We can start telling people what's really happening. NEIL
DeGRASSE TYSON: Edie is diving into
anything that will help people understand the oceans, including a children's
book series on bioluminescence. The
originality of her work and her determination to share it with the public have
earned her the prestigious MacArthur award. EDIE
WIDDER: I never, ever would have imagined the kind of career
I've had. It just wouldn't have occurred to me that anything like this could
have been possible. I didn't have any such aspirations. And I still can't
believe my good fortune. Credits
