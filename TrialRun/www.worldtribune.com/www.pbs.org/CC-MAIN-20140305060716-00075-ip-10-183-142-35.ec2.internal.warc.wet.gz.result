Faces Deep Budget Shortfall Final Stimulus Package Aimed at Jolting Sluggish Economy JIM LEHRER: Wall Street was flat after yesterday’s big sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 3 points to close at 7,555. The Nasdaq fell 2 points to close below 1,468.A deal in California to break the state budget impasse may be in danger. Republicans in the State Senate ousted their leader on Tuesday because he agreed to tax increases. That makes it less likely the deal can win approval to fix a budget deficit of $42 billion. Orders went out yesterday to lay off hundreds of state employees.The widow of a longtime smoker won a potentially landmark case in Florida. A state court jury ordered the Philip Morris tobacco company to pay $8 million in damages. It was the first of 8,000 similar cases pending in Florida. In 2006, the State Supreme Court struck down a class-action award worth $145 billion.A federal appeals court has blocked the transfer of 17 detainees from Guantanamo Bay onto U.S. soil. All are Muslims from western China. A lower court had ruled they were not enemy combatants and should not be held at Guantanamo. The appeals court said only the executive branch, not the courts, can make that decision.And in Iraq, gunmen assassinated a member of the largest Sunni Arab party. He was shot in his car in Baghdad. It was the latest in a string of political assassinations since Iraq held provincial elections last month. At least three other politicians have been killed and another six wounded, attacked or kidnapped.

Under the program, taxpayers make voluntary $3 checkoffs on federal tax returns. Republicans said ending it would save $617 million over 10 years, and they criticized Democrats for opposing the idea. REP. VIRGINIA FOXX (R-N.C.): They don’t think of $617 million as significant.Mr. Speaker, the American people think that $617 million is significant. They want us to cut spending wherever we can. And this is a program that has long ago outlived its usefulness. HARI SREENIVASAN: Democrats shot back that Republicans had an ulterior motive for targeting public funding of campaigns. REP. FRANK PALLONE (D-N.J): This is the Republicans basically catering to special interests and the large corporations, who will spend unlimited amounts of corporate money on campaigns, and not having, in this case, a public financing component through voluntary, largely small donations. HARI SREENIVASAN: The measure was considered unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Federal Reserve will stay the course, for now, on its efforts to boost the economy. The Central Bank said today the recovery is continuing, but it’s not strong enough to bring down unemployment without help. As a result, the Fed will continue buying U.S. Treasury bonds in a $600 billion program. That is intended to lower interest rates and spur companies to expand and hire. On Wall Street, stocks managed modest gains. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced eight points to close at 11,985. The Nasdaq rose 20 points to close at 2,739. Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was transferred today to a rehabilitation facility in Houston. An ambulance carried her from a nearby hospital. She had been in intensive care since arriving Friday from Tucson, two weeks after being shot in the head. Overnight, doctors upgraded Giffords’ condition to good, and they updated her status this afternoon. DR. IMOIGELE AISIKU, director of Neurocritical Care, TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital: She’s very interactive with us. I can tell when I go in and I’m examining and so forth that she’s cooperating and interactive and aware of what’s going on. So, I think, along with everything that’s been said, it’s progressing quite remarkably. HARI SREENIVASAN: The medical team also removed a tube draining fluid from Giffords’ head wound on Monday. A tense calm returned to Lebanon today, after two days of protests against the rising power of Hezbollah. At the same time, the pro-Iranian group’s choice for prime minister, Najib Mikati, moved to form — moved to form a new government, and he met with outgoing Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Two weeks ago, Hezbollah and its allies pulled out of Hariri’s pro-Western government, causing it to collapse. The ruling party candidate in Haiti, Jude Celestin, is dropping out of a presidential runoff. He had been under pressure to quit the race after widespread fraud in the first round last November. Celestin’s departure means former first lady Mirlande Manigat will face popular singer Michel Martelly in the runoff. No date has been set for the vote. In Afghanistan, the new Parliament has opened, more than four months after a disputed election. President Hamid Karzai swore in the lawmakers, after trying to delay the session for a vote-fraud probe. And he warned, some would still lose their seats. The Afghan leader also accused the international community of meddling in the vote. Toyota announced a recall today of nearly 1.7 million cars around the world for fuel leaks. The recall mostly affects vehicles in Japan, but it also includes two Lexus luxury models in North America sold between 2006 and 2008. Toyota was plagued by a series of major recalls last year, and its U.S. sales suffered as a result. Those are some of the day’s major stories.

Bomb Suspect +1 EMAIL BY jbreslow May 14, 2010 at 8:48 AM ESTOil spill workers connect sections of oil booms to protect marshlands in the Gulf of Mexico. Photo by John Moore/Getty Images.When the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk into the Gulf of Mexico last month, officials first estimated that it was leaking oil at a rate of 1,000 barrels a day. That figure was later revised to 5,000 barrels per day. Multiple reports out Friday, however, show the spill may be much, much worse.An NPR investigation has found that there is at least 10 times more oil spilling into the Gulf than official estimates suggest. NPR’s findings are based on the analysis of three academics and, if accurate, would mean “the BP spill is already far larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska, which spilled at least 250,000 barrels of oil.” Based on video of the underwater leak released by BP this week, the analysis found the range of the leak may be anywhere from 50,000 barrels per day to as much as 100,000 barrels per day.You can compare different estimates using the NewsHour’s spill tracker.“BP has said repeatedly that there is no reliable way to measure the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by looking at the oil gushing out of the pipe,” NPR reports.BP has said that at worst, oil is spilling into the Gulf at a rate of 60,000 barrels a day. But the New York Times points out:“Scientists and environmental groups are raising sharp questions about that estimate, declaring that the leak must be far larger. They also criticize BP for refusing to use well-known scientific techniques that would give a more precise figure.”We’ll have more about oil spill estimates later today here on the Rundown.Pakistan Arrests Suspect Tied to Times Square PlotPakistan’s government has arrested a suspect tied to the Pakistani Taliban who has admitted to helping carry out the attempted bombing of Times Square.“The suspect, whose arrest has not been previously disclosed, provided an ‘independent stream’ of evidence that the Pakistani Taliban were behind the attempt and has admitted helping Faisal Shahzad, the main suspect, travel into Pakistan’s tribal belt for bomb training,” according to the Washington Post.A clear link with the Pakistani Taliban “would move the militant group onto an expanding list of al-Qaeda affiliates that pose a direct threat to the United States,” according to the Post, and “put new pressure on the U.S. relationship with Pakistan at a time when President Obama is pushing the country to expand its military campaign against insurgent groups.”News of the arrest follows a series of FBI raids across the Northeast on Thursday. Authorities arrested three individuals who are believed to have helped Shahzad secure money for the plot.Thai Troops Fire on ProtestersNew clashes have erupted in Thailand between government forces and the nation’s red shirt protesters following the shooting Thursday of a leading renegade general.At least two people have been killed and 45 injured by the violence, which according to the Associated Press, has turned the Thai capital of Bangkok “into a virtual war zone.”The BBC reports that a France 24 TV reporter was hit by a round, and there were reports two Thai journalists had also been shot.The Guardian UK is live blogging the developments here.Atlantis Set for Final VoyageNASA launches its final voyage for space shuttle Atlantis on Friday, a 12-day mission that will deliver a spare module, batteries and a communications antenna to the International Space Station.

Ella Fitzgerald
Something to Live For
Her first dream was to be a dancer. Growing up in New York, she was inspired by “Snake Hips” Tucker, studying his serpentine moves and practicing them constantly with friends. Then, one fateful night at the Apollo Theater in 1934, the headlining Edwards Sisters brought down the house with their dancing. Amateur Hour began immediately after, and a 16-year-old Ella Fitzgerald stepped on stage, but was too intimidated to dance. Instead, she sang “Judy,” silenced the awestruck crowd, and won first prize. It was the beginning of one of the most celebrated careers in music history.
Born in Newport News, Virginia in 1917, Ella Fitzgerald moved with her mother to New York after the death of her father. Living in Yonkers, Fitzgerald attended public school, where she sang in the glee club and received her musical education. After her early success at the Apollo, and as a popular performer at a number of other amateur venues, Fitzgerald was invited to join Chick Webb’s band. Within a short while she was the star attraction, and had made a number hits including her trademark “A-tisket, A-tasket” (1938). After Webb’s death in 1939, Fitzgerald led the band for three years.
During her time with Webb’s band, Fitzgerald recorded with a number of other musicians, including Benny Goodman. By the time she began her solo career in the mid-1940s, she was a well-respected figure throughout the music industry. Her vibrant and energetic voice showed an exceptional range and control. Performing with “Jazz at the Philharmonic,” her popularity grew beyond the music world. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, she continued to perform as a jazz musician, but concentrated primarily on popular music. Rivaled only by Frank Sinatra, her recordings of work by Cole Porter, Ira and George Gershwin, and Rogers and Hart were incredibly successful.
One of the early “scat” performers, Fitzgerald found a place among the growing jazz innovators, making recordings with such greats as Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and Louis Armstrong. Her true genius, however, was not formal innovation or deeper expression, but artistic renderings of the enthusiastic songs of her time. “I’m very shy, and I shy away from people,” Ella once said. “But the moment I hit the stage, it’s a different feeling. I get nerve from somewhere; maybe it’s because it’s something I love to do.” More than anything, it is this love of performing that won her the hearts of millions throughout the world.
By the 1970s, she was performing with a trio headed by pianist Tommy Flanagan, and regularly with dozens of different symphony orchestras. Though her voice was not what it had been, Fitzgerald’s enthusiasm and charisma continued to excite crowds well into the 1980s. After a successful appearance in the United Kingdom in 1990, she retired due to ailing health. Two years later President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Honor. Suffering continued health problems, Fitzgerald spent the last few years of her life in her Beverly Hills home. On June 15, 1996 she died at the age of seventy-eight.
Of Fitzgerald, Johnny Mathis said, “She was the best there ever was. Amongst all of us who sing, she was the best.” From those early days on Harlem streets to the upper stratosphere of musical fame, Ella Fitzgerald’s life was the quintessential American success story. Through fifty-eight years of performing, thirteen Grammys and more than forty million records sold, she elevated swing, bebop, and ballads to their highest potential. She was, undeniably, the First Lady of Song.

Ella,
You changed my life. I love your music so much. After my dad gets done beating me, I go to my room and listen to it and it helps my black eye and broken arm to not hurt so much. When my dad goes to stab me with his knife, I turn up the radio real loud and all, and he like.. stops. He stabs my mom instead. She screams, but sinceI turned up the radio, no one can hear her. That’s how she died. Well, my dad is about to come home, and if he sees this, I’ll get worse than the knife. I love you Ella.

She had a sad upbringing though. She used to dance on street corner’s to earn money and dappled with prostitution to live. She was living on the streets in her teens. It is wonderful she made it BIG in her later teens.

Ella Fitzgerald was indeed a remarkable woman. I should note, however, that the biographical sketch above may be slightly off. Ms. Fitzgerald was awarded the National Medal of *Arts* (not the National Medal of Honor, which doesn’t exist – there’s the Congressional Medal of Honor for military gallantry) by President Reagan in 1987. (See http://www.nea.gov for more information.)
thais phelts(Edwards)
I am the daughter of Ruth Edwards one the famous Edward Sisters. They went on at the Apollo before Ms Fitzgerald and she said their act was so great she changed her mind about dancing and decided to sing instead. In a way they helped her decide her career and she turned out to be a great singer, thank you mom. Ruth and Aunt Louise Edwards. The famous tap dancing Edwards Sisters
♥♥may ♥♥

I don’t know how I missed this performance as I have been an Ella fan since the 50’s. Is there a way I can buy this now?
kcb
I am doing a speech on her in class and I really hope I can inspire my classmates to go and look her up! I want them to actually know what real music is and love ella like I do! She is soooo amazing words cannot describe how much I want to be like her with her humblneness, kindness, and presence! It is just a shame that more and more people do not know who she is.

About Julliard
The following is the foreword to the book JUILLIARD published by Harry N. Abrams, Inc. in conjunction with the American Masters program JUILLIARD.
Foreword by Frank Rich
American culture, like the nation that is ever reinventing it, is so sprawling and varied that it’s hard to imagine how any single institution could encompass it. But such is the nearly century-long history of Juilliard. Born when a young country was first discovering that it might have a serious appetite for the arts, Juilliard grew up with both the country and its burgeoning cultural capital of New York to become an internationally recognized synonym for the pinnacle of artistic achievement.
From its advent as the Institute of Musical Art in 1905, Juilliard knew what it was about. Frank Damrosch, its creator, championed “high standards” in his opening address. As the head of music education for New York’s public school system in an era when immigrants were remaking the city, he had the wisdom to seek students of every possible origin, regardless of gender or social class. This was far from a standard vision for the time. High culture in America still meant mainly imported European culture, not the heterogeneous, home-grown brew it would become. Damrosch wanted to inculcate the classical tradition in his students, but in a fertile democratic environment, open to all with the talent and the will to pursue it. This wholly American idea caught on immediately. Planned for 150 students, Damrosch’s school had an enrollment of 500 within a year.
What would follow would be a peripatetic history as the Institute of Musical Art moved from the Lenox Mansion on lower Fifth Avenue all the way uptown to Claremont Avenue in Morningside Heights before merging with the Juilliard Graduate School in 1926. In keeping with the expanding cultural map of the city, Juilliard would move to Lincoln Center in 1969. But more revealing than the school’s geographical journey is the steady expansion of its artistic portfolio. Dance was added in 1951, then drama in 1968, then jazz. All the while the international reach of the student body was expanding as well. This was surely a formula for explosive creative fusion, and the proof is in the extraordinary range of brilliant alumni.
Whether as students or teachers, the Juilliard roster is in itself a cavalcade of our crazy-quilt artistic history: Richard Rodgers and Kevin Spacey, Leontyne Price and Milton Babbitt, Paul Taylor and Dorothy DeLay, John Houseman and Martha Clarke, Sarah Chang and Robin Williams, William Schuman and Marvin Hamlisch. It’s not just that this institution has nurtured so many of the giants in all the arts, but in true American fashion, it has nurtured high and pop culture alike, from the Met and the Philharmonic to Broadway and Hollywood. It has also, again in the best American tradition, forged pioneers and leaders who have fanned out throughout the country and the world to bring Damrosch’s “high standards” to every conceivable performing-arts arena. Under its modern leader, Joseph W. Polisi, the ideals of artistic citizenship and advocacy have been added to Juilliard’s repertoire, and you see those ideals being carried forward everywhere by the school’s progeny, from the national educational mission of Wynton Marsalis to the remaking of Shakespearean theater under Michael Kahn’s auspices in Washington. Juilliard is, as you will see, an epic story, but a quintessentially American epic of perennial reinvention, with thrilling new chapters being added every day.
