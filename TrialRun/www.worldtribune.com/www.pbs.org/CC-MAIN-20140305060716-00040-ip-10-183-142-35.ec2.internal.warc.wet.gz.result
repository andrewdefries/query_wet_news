“Every piece of abstract art that I make has a back story,” says Mary Heilmann, who relays youthful fantasies of wanting to be a Catholic martyr, her childhood dream to become an artist, as well as the antagonism she experienced in school when transitioning from pottery to painting. Shown completing a new body of work, the segment begins in the artist’s secluded Bridgehampton studio on Long Island. “My spiritual life is very important to me and I think the artworks are icons,” says Heilmann, who believes in the ecumenical power of art to “transport a person in a soulful, rich way, without having any fear of punishment or Hell or sin.” The segment also features Heilmann’s touring retrospective at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, where she's designed colorful chairs on wheels that viewers can use to relax, meditate, or socialize with one another and have “a conversation through the work.”

At the home of what the White House called a typical middle-class family, Mr. Obama said he’s optimistic that agreement can be reached, but again drew a hard line for Republicans in Congress.BARACK OBAMA: Everybody’s is going to have to share in some sacrifice. But it starts with folks who are in the best position to sacrifice, who are in the best position to do a little bit more, to step up. And that’s what my plan does.So, just to be clear, I’m not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the top rate from going up for folks at the top 2 percent.JUDY WOODRUFF: The president phoned House Speaker John Boehner yesterday, their first direct talk in almost a week. But, today, White House spokesman Jay Carney wouldn’t share details of the call.JAY CARNEY, White House: We believe it’s in the interest of achieving an agreement not to do that.JUDY WOODRUFF: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said yesterday the White House was absolutely willing to go over the cliff if Republicans held firm in their opposition to raising rates on the wealthy.But it was the administration’s other demand, to give the president authority over the nation’s debt ceiling, that roiled tempers on Capitol Hill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tried yesterday to force a vote on the issue, assuming Republicans would prevail.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-Ky.: Look, the only way we ever cut spending around here is by using the debate over the debt limit to do it. Now the president wants to remove that spur to cut altogether. Of course, it gets in the way of his spending plans. Well, I assure you, it’s not going to happen.JUDY WOODRUFF: But when Majority Leader Harry Reid took him up on the offer today, McConnell backed down.SEN. HARRY REID, D-Nev.: This morning, the Republican leader asked consent to have a vote on this proposal. Just now, I told everyone that we’re willing to have that vote, up-or-down vote. And now the Republican leader objects to his own idea.JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, Republicans learned today the party is losing one of their most outspoken voices on fiscal issues. Two-term South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint announced that he will resign his seat in January to become the next president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank.In a statement, DeMint said: “I’m leaving the Senate now, but I’m not leaving the fight,” adding he’s going to Heritage “at a time when the conservative movement needs strong leadership in the battle of ideas.”A tea party favorite, DeMint had blasted the House Republicans’ proposal to raise revenue earlier in the week. South Carolina’s other senator, Lindsey Graham, lamented the loss of his colleague.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: He really did strongly and passionately advocate for his positions and did it very effectively. Jim made the Republican Party, quite frankly, look inward and do some self-evaluation. Conservatism is an asset, not a liability.JUDY WOODRUFF: The other side of Capitol Hill was largely quiet today, with the House not in session and most members gone home for the weekend recess.

The Beatles sang "I Want to Hold Your Hand," and millions of women in England and America swooned over John, Paul, George and Ringo. Muhammad Ali (still known by his birth name of Cassius Clay) was crowned heavyweight champion of the world and Mary Poppins packed audiences into movie theaters. While Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, another future Nobel Peace laureate, Nelson Mandela, was sentenced to life in prison in South Africa. Harold Wilson was the prime minister of Britain in 1964, and Lyndon B. Johnson had recently become the president of the United States after the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. After a U.S. destroyer was allegedly attacked off the coast of North Vietnam, the U.S. Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving Johnson the power to conduct military operations and escalate the war in Vietnam.

We all know that hackers can access our computers. But did you know that they can also take control of our cars, medical devices, and even kid’s toys? University of Washington computer scientist Yoshi Kohno hacks into everyday machines, deciphering how criminals could transform them into perfect spies—or lethal weapons. It’s all part of an effort to make sure hackers can’t turn our increasingly electronic world against us.

Can Science Stop Crime?
PBS Airdate: October 17, 2012
DAVID POGUE: A new kind of criminal activity is on the rise, thanks to computers: it's cybercrime. And Yoshi Kohno has mastered its tools.
CBS NEWS ANNOUNCER (Film Clip): It's being called a security breach of staggering proportions.
TARYN KOHNO (Yoshi Kohno's wife): Yoshi could hack anything. If a bank says, "Our site is secure," in my head, I'm always like, "No it's not. Yoshi could get into it."
ABC NEWS ANNOUNCER (Film Clip): A pack of cyberthieves allegedly managed to infect computers at NASA, Netflix, iTunes.
DAN HALPERIN (Graduate Student): He comes up with the most creative attacks and the most scary things you could imagine.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi has hacked into cars…
Voting machines…
NEWS ANNOUNCER (Film Clip): Even worse, the fear that an election could be hacked.
DAVID POGUE: And medical devices.
CNBC NEWS ANNOUNCER (Film Clip): Somebody could remotely amp up a heart device. Hacking can literately become a matter of life and death.
DAVID POGUE: These days, we're surrounded by computerized and networked devices. Yoshi sees each one as a potential doorway that he can break down and then take control of what's inside.
DAN HALPERIN: The fact that everything has a computer in it is really alarming, from a security point of view. And the fact that those computers are all generally on networks is even more so.
TARYN KOHNO: The comment that people mostly say is "Thank goodness Yoshi's on our side."
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi is a computer hacker, but, lucky for us, he works for the good guys.
TADAYOSHI "YOSHI" KOHNO (University of Washington Security and Privacy Lab): Jokingly, amongst the lab, we say, you know, we're trying to save the world.
DAVID POGUE: As a security expert at the University of Washington, he's on the frontlines of the fight against cybercrime.
YOSHI KOHNO: Our privacy is slowly eroding over time, and we need to either make a conscious decision to let it continue to happen or try to stop it.
TARYN KOHNO: When we share some of Yoshi's research with friends or family, they're like, "oh my, g…. I never would have thought about that. Where does Yoshi get these ideas?"
DAVID POGUE: As part of his strategy, he is constantly trying to get into the heads of the bad guys.
YOSHI KOHNO: This is the ability to see the world the way an adversary might see the world.
DAVID POGUE: And if you look at the world this way, you're going to find weaknesses in the security armor everywhere, even in the etched glass of an office door, designed to prevent people from seeing in.
YOSHI KOHNO: As a security person, the first question that came to my mind was, "Well, does it really work? And is it possible to see through?"
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi knew that the jagged surface of the glass was bending the light, making it hard to see through. If he could find a way to smooth the surface, he would be able to spy on someone.
YOSHI KOHNO: This was as simple as actually putting honey on the surface of the glass.
DAVID POGUE: And just like that, with a drop of honey and a smooth layer of glass, Yoshi figured out how to straighten the light, make the glass transparent and, perhaps, invade someone's privacy.
YOSHI KOHNO: This is a perfect example of how, just looking at the world in a slightly different way, you can uncover potential privacy or security issues.
DAVID POGUE: By all accounts, Yoshi has been looking at the world this way for most of his life.
YOSHI KOHNO: I think I learned a lot about security and privacy in the real world from my parents, you know: the need to always lock the door or the need to be cautious about how you walk, when you walk to school.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi was a computer whiz from a young age.
YOSHI KOHNO: On the side you see: "You're entering into the world of cyberpunks, hackers, freakers and programmers, beware."
DAVID POGUE: He was fascinated by cryptograms, an old spy technique of creating secret codes.
YOSHI KOHNO: I was intrigued by cryptography, because it had an element of, kind of, adversarial tension between me and the person who made this cryptogram, you know: can I figure out what they did to try to make this message secret, so that I could try to solve it?
DAVID POGUE: Today, Yoshi leads a team of young security experts who are trying to outsmart their adversaries, any potential computer hackers with ill intent.
KARL KOSCHER (University of Washington Security and Privacy Lab): It's always an arms race. You're trying to stay one step ahead of the criminals, and the criminals will try to stay one step ahead of you.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi's team has the know-how to hack into pretty much any machine that broadcasts or receives digital information wirelessly. Yoshi believes, if it's connected to the outside world, then there's no such thing as an unhackable computer; like the Nike + iPod Sport Kit, a gadget designed for runners to put in their shoes to help track their speed and distance.
YOSHI KOHNO: It really was an example of a technology that pervades your life in different ways than a traditional laptop or a desktop.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi figured out how to hack into the signal sent out by this tiny transmitter and keep tabs on anyone wearing the device.
YOSHI KOHNO: There she is. I see her, the sensor, on my laptop.
DAVID POGUE: And the news took notice.
NEWS ANNOUNCER (Film Clip): …one of TIME magazine's gadgets of the year.
NEWS ANNOUNCER (Film Clip): …, but it also has a serious security problem that could leave innocent users vulnerable to invasions of their personal privacy.
DAVID POGUE: But Yoshi's goal isn't to make us all paranoid. Instead, he wants the makers of these devices to plug their security holes before they go on the market.
Even if you don't have the Sport Kit, there's a good chance you're carrying around something else that could compromise your personal data without your knowing it.
New generations of passport cards and enhanced drivers' licenses have computer chips that Yoshi and his team have been able to read, some up to 50 yards away.
YOSHI KOHNO: We, as consumers, need to be aware that our privacy is being exposed by the technologies we have on our bodies and around us.
DAVID POGUE: And it's not just your privacy that Yoshi is trying to defend. If a machine is controlled by a computer and connected to a network, then hackers could potentially take over the reins, even a machine as complex as a car.
FRANZI ROESNER: (University of Washington Security and Privacy Lab): The car project was one of these examples where we look at an existing, on-the-market device to see if it's vulnerable to attack. Essentially, could we hack the car and control it remotely?
DAVID POGUE: You might not realize it, but if you drive a car made in the last few years, it's full of computer software.
YOSHI KOHNO: We have computers controlling the brakes, the steering, the door locks.
DAVID POGUE: You can also order some cars with built-in cell phones systems, designed to connect to operators in an emergency.
YOSHI KOHNO: There are cars that can call 911 for you, if you get into an accident.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi saw the car's cell phone as another potential security hole, one that could serve as a portal to a vehicle's computer system, to be exploited by a cyber car thief.
DAN HALPERIN: If someone else can use that remote connection to do security attacks, it makes you a lot more vulnerable.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi and his team set out to hack into one of those cars, so the first thing they do is buy one. They want to see if their car's phone can give them a direct line to its computer system. Their fear is that an evil hacker could set up a computer to call thousands of random numbers to locate and then take control of a car.
ALEXEI CZESKIS: There's that number. Ready to dial it?
KARL KOSCHER: Sure.
ALEXEI CZESKIS: Okay.
KARL KOSCHER: I'm dialing the number.
DAVID POGUE: Once they have the car's number, they call it, hoping they'll be able to install their own software over the phone line and onto the car's computer.
ALEXEI CZESKIS: The sound is going to come over those headphones, play into the phone that's going to get received by the car.
KARL KOSCHER: All right, and send.
All right, went through successfully.
ALEXEI CZESKIS: Awesome.
DAVID POGUE: Now they could have the car report its G.P.S. location, and they send the coordinates to Yoshi, who stands in as a thief.
YOSHI KOHNO: Hello?
FRANZI ROESNER: Hi, Yoshi? We've got a car for you that we're going to unlock.
YOSHI KOHNO: Ah, great.
FRANZI ROESNER: And we're going to flash the lights, so that you can find it.
DAVID POGUE: Now that they have a direct line to the car's computers, they want to see if they can take control and make the vehicle think that someone is flashing the lights.
FRANZI ROESNER: Okay, flashing lights now.
YOSHI KOHNO: Let me see, flashing lights, flashing lights. Ah, yes, I see the vehicle. Okay. And I'm walking up to it now.
DAVID POGUE: But could they unlock the doors and start the engine?
FRANZI ROESNER: Now we're going to initiate the unlock sequence. The car should unlock and the engine should start.
YOSHI KOHNO: Okay, the car is on. Getting in the car, and I'm going to start driving. Here I am driving.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi's team took over the car from an office a few blocks away, but with this technique, they could, theoretically, do it from almost anywhere in the world, using a wireless connection.
KARL KOSCHER: What really surprised us was how easy it was to do these things. We could take over almost anything in the car that was electronically controlled.
DAVID POGUE: And these days, even your brakes are electronically controlled. Does that mean that Yoshi could hack into a car's brakes?
YOSHI KOHNO: So Alexei will be in the driver's seat, and we'll be up in the bleachers.
DAVID POGUE: The team takes a car to a closed track to find out.
YOSHI KOHNO: Okay, are we ready?
Okay, Alexei, we've unlocked the brake controller and, uh, just to verify: you have your helmet on and all your safety precautions in place, right?
ALEXEI CZESKIS: That's right, helmet on, gloves on, strapped in and ready to go.
YOSHI KOHNO: Great. Okay, go ahead and go, and we will apply your brakes when you get to the checkered flag area.
DAVID POGUE: By sending their malicious code to the car, could Yoshi trick it into jamming on the brakes?
TARYN KOHNO: It is a very scary thought that you're driving in a car and some kid could be messing with you just for fun.
YOSHI KOHNO: And we'll be applying your brakes shortly, right about now.
Oh, ooh, yeah, that worked! Ooh, is he going to go to the wall? No. Are you okay, Alexei?
FRANZI ROESNER: Did you do the right brake?
ALEXEI CZESKIS: Woo hoo!
FRANZI ROESNER: Wow, okay, that worked.
DAVID POGUE: What Yoshi can do looks pretty scary, but it's the result of months of painstaking research by the sharpest minds in the security business.
FRANZI ROESNER: We don't believe that there are hackers out there attacking today's cars. Our goal, really, is to show that these kind of attacks are possible, so that the manufacturers of the cars, and the government, and the various policy organizations take it seriously for the next generation of cars.
DAVID POGUE: Yoshi is one of our most vigilant guards against cybercrime. He has consulted with government and industry, even companies like Microsoft, pushing them to examine things like car security, electronic voting and the safety of implantable medical devices.
DAN HALPERIN: Yoshi's goal is to secure the future, to make the world a safer place.
YOSHI KOHNO: I really do want to understand how we can protect the security of future technologies, so that when my kids are my age they're in an environment where technologies are safe, reliable, secure.
DAVID POGUE: So Yoshi will continue to hunt down the holes, the weaknesses all around us, conquering the criminals by outwitting them at their own game, long before they can make their move.
KARL KOSCHER: He has all sorts of devious thoughts that would be pretty harmful, if he was on the wrong side of the law.
DAN HALPERIN: We thank our lucky stars that Yoshi is on the side of the good guys.
DAVID POGUE: It's a good thing, because when Yoshi looks at the world, he sees a lot of hacking left to do.
YOSHI KOHNO: You see computers in transportation systems, stoplights, our power distribution grids, the sewage and water lines, airplanes. There's computers everywhere, and I think we've only begun to scratch the surface.

The American President: "The Heroic Posture"
From the beginning, the presidential office has beckoned to national heroes renowned for their selfless service to their country. This affinity is especially strong for men of military fame, for the president is formally commander-in-chief as well as symbolically the steward of the national interest. The president-as-national hero exemplifies the value we all place on authenticity in governance. We explore here four personifications of this ideal, suggesting a wide-ranging reality behind an enduring standard.
