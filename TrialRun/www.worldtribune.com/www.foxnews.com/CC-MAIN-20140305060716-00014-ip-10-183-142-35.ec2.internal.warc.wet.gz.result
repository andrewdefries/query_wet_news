This is a rush transcript from "Fox News Watch," October 6, 2012 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

JON SCOTT, HOST OF "FOX NEWS WATCH": On "FOX News Watch' -- a week of anticipation as the news media got set for the big debates.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor Romney, they say, does not have to win a charm offensive on that debate stage. He simply has to prove that he can relate to average American problems. A lot at stake here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SCOTT: But when all was said a done, a big win for Romney, a big loss for the president, and a big shocker for the mainstream press.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CO-HOST, ABC "GOOD MORNING AMERICA": Where was the president? Where was the fight?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SCOTT: The liberal media in overdrive, trying to spin the outcome and defend their man.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC: Did you really mean to call Barack Obama, the president of the United States, lazy?
JOHN SUNUNU, R-N.H., FORMER GOVERNER: Yes!
MITCHELL: But I think to call the president...
SUNUNU: All right, Andrea. Whatever.
MITCHELL: ... lazy and...
SUNUNU: Whatever you want!
(END VIDEO CLIP
SCOTT: Another big story, new details about the murders of our ambassador and the other three Americans in Libya. But that was missed by most in the news business.
A video clip from the president's past gets new attention for what was said. How did the media react? And is it fair game?
Spanish channel Univision gets high marks for its coverage of the Fast and Furious scandal. Why didn't anyone else seem to notice?
And the NBC-owned Weather Channel heats up a little controversy about winter storms.
On the panel this week, writer and Fox News contributor Judy Miller, Richard Grennell, who served as press spokesman for the last four U.S. ambassadors to the U.N., Jim Pinkerton, contributing editor The American Conservative magazine, and talk Radio News bureau chief Ellen Rattner.
I'm Jon Scott. "Fox News Watch" is on right now.
Ah, wouldn't you love to know what the cartoon thought bubbles above their heads would say? That was the scene at the end of the presidential debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Obama. And this is some of the coverage that followed.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIT HUME, FOX SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: He was a lot like the President Obama we're used to hearing. I don't think he seemed rusty. He seemed comfortable discussing the subjects. But I don't think he had the spark or the energy or the precision, really, tonight that Governor Romney had.
ED SCHULTZ, MSNBC "THE ED SHOW": The president tonight was disappointing when he allowed Mitt Romney to talk about $716 billion in Medicare, and the president did not come out and explain it and go after him.
BRIAN WILLIAMS, ANCHOR, "NBC NIGHTLY NEWS": It appeared that an energetic Mitt Romney showed up for this face time tonight before a national audience.
CHUCK TODD, NBC WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT/POLITICAL DIR.: I think you're going to see team Obama buckle down more. They went through a lot of mock debates, supposedly, but he did seem to come out and wasn't crisp. And instead, you saw Mitt Romney -- he looked like a credible alternative tonight.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn't see any knockout punches.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No?
STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn't see any breakthrough moments or major mistakes by either candidate. I think Governor Romney will get the boost that challengers usually get coming out of these debates.
JOHN KING, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: If you look in the Twitterverse, it is clear that the Republicans are very, very, very happy at this moment, including the top team around Mitt Romney, a lot of liberals complaining about the president's performance.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST OF "HARDBALL": Where was Obama tonight?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SCOTT: Well, there you go, Jim! The mainstream and liberal media are just shocked; shocked that President Obama didn't win that debate.
JIM PINKERTON, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE MAGAZINE: Right. And Chris Matthews went on to say, I think on that segment, he says, If only the president had been watching my show...
(LAUGHTER)
PINKERTON: ... he would -- Andrea Mitchell and Ed and all the rest of them (INAUDIBLE) Listen, this was one of those epic political masters (ph), if you will. Jay Leno said it best, said; Only the replacement refs for the NFL think that President Obama had a good night.
(LAUGHTER)
SCOTT: You know, that comment there that challengers always get a boost -- I mean, nobody seemed to want to say that Mitt Romney won because Mitt Romney won!
JUDY MILLER, WRITE, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. It was amazing. I mean, when even, even MSNBC had to carry on as if someone in the family had died -- you know, it was an astonishing performance, but I think it was a rare moment of consensus, Jon, in the press because the press basically agreed Romney had won. And it must have been very painful for some of them to admit that, but it was obvious.
SCOTT: Ellen, the media ahead of this were waiting for a Mitt Romney gaffe or a misstep. They were going to pounce upon that, and it didn't happen.
ELLEN RATTNER, TALK RADIO NEWS SERVICE: No, it certainly did not. I was not one of the not mainstream liberal media but the middle-stream liberal media that was very upset with how the presidential did.
And I actually have a theory about why he didn't do as well as he could have, and that is that this White House, as opposed to the Bush White House and the Clinton White House, has been much more protective. Usually, only the five or six television mainstream people get questions. He doesn't engage in the sort of back and forth.
Even President Bush had off-the-records with radio people. And so therefore, he doesn't get to hear what some of the little-stream media have to say. And that would train him better.
SCOTT: We put together a list of the recent interviews the president has done, I mean, hard-hitting events like People magazine and "Entertainment Tonight" and Glamour. He's -- he's had some...
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joy Behar.
SCOTT: Joy Behar. That's for sure.
RICHARD GRENNELL, FMR. SPOKESMAN, LAST 4 U.S. AMBASSADORS TO U.N.: I actually think it's a little bit even deeper than that, in that we saw Obama without a teleprompter. And the media are jumping to say, Oh, Obama just wasn't himself. I think he was himself. He was himself when he doesn't have a teleprompter. And Mitt Romney was himself, too. See, this is the exact Mitt Romney that the media have not wanted us to see!
MILLER: Well, where has he been up until now?
(CROSSTALK)
PINKERTON: Buried under a narrative -- this Tuesday's Washington Post before the new realization of the debate came in -- the headline is, "The staying power of 47 percent." Now, why is 47 percent staying? Because the media are putting it on the...
(CROSSTALK)
MILLER: Well, but President Obama did not mention that. He did go on the $5 trillion dollar attack. So he did nothing to come back at him! It was -- I got to tell you, I've -- I've watched all these debates since Clinton's first debate, and I was in shock!
GRENNELL: Again, the reason why he didn't bring it up, it wasn't on the teleprompter!
MILLER: Well, that -- I've seen him in the press room, and that is not (INAUDIBLE)
PINKERTON: And look, just to -- I actually agree with what Ellen was saying. Matt Latimer (ph) in The Daily Beast and Andrea Tantaros in The New York Daily News both said, Look, after four years of fawning press coverage, he's not ready for anything resembling a tough question or even, as Rick is suggesting, a tough opportunity.
MILLER: There was just an attitude by Obama of aloof disdain. It was supposed to be part of a strategy of not being overly aggressive, but it just looked like condescension! And it felt terrible!
SCOTT: Well, Ellen had her theory about why the president came off the way he did. We've compiled a few, and I just love these -- on MSNBC, Michael Eric Dyson claimed that in his opinion, the president was overly deferential to Mitt Romney because he was concerned that he would come across as an angry black man. That's what he said on MSNBC.
Michael Moore -- you know Michael Moore. He blamed the president's lackluster effort on the coaching or the debate sparring that he got from John Kerry.
And Al Gore -- this is my personal favorite, being from Denver -- Al Gore on his Current TV, the channel that nobody watches, said that Obama's poor performance could be blamed on Denver's altitude. So there you go.
(CROSSTALK)
PINKERTON: It's always the climate with Al Gore!
(LAUGHTER)
MILLER: ... he wasn't wearing enough earth tones.
(LAUGHTER)
GRENNELL: But here's the thing, is President Obama has been to Colorado so much that even if that was the case, that he had a little altitude sickness, he certainly has adjusted. He's been campaigning more than he's been governing.
PINKERTON: And -- by the way, Bill Maher (INAUDIBLE) throw him in there -- said that it was like Michael Jackson on tranquilizers.
(LAUGHTER)
PINKERTON: I mean, this has been a brutal, brutal time, where the -- I think the left is afraid of what they're going to see in the next couple debates.
GRENNELL: Yes, Andrew Sullivan...
MILLER: You know what?
GRENNELL: ... called it a disaster.
MILLER: I actually...
GRENNELL: I love that!
MILLER: I actually think that he will do quite well in the next two debates. But can he do (INAUDIBLE)
PINKERTON: The next one, we're going to have Teleprompters.
MILLER: You know, get off the teleprompter thing because if you really covered him, he really is quite fine off the cuff. He just doesn't get the hard questions.
SCOTT: He had four minutes more speaking time during those 90 minutes than Mitt Romney did, and he made far fewer points or punches.
RATTNER: You're asking this part of the press to comment? I mean, I got to tell you, it was not the best. And -- but I also have to say that part of it, I think, was that he didn't -- you know, we always say you invite -- invite the person in your living room for the next four years. That's who you're going to vote for president.
And The Baltimore Sun also said that Mitt Romney won the debate because he talked a little bit about his personal journey. The president didn't talk about that at all.
SCOTT: OK. Next on "News Watch," was the president's poor showing the fault of the debate's moderator?
MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're -- they're just being crushed!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ANNOUNCER: The media gave Mitt Romney high marks for his debate performance. How will his success affect his coverage now? And how did the media rate the job of the moderator? That's next on "News Watch."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SCOTT: PBS "News Hour" host Jim Lehrer moderated the great debate this week, but his performance didn't win him many accolades. Some of the critiques -- Robert Bianco from USA Today -- "Apparently, Jim Lehrer thinks the best moderator is no moderator at all." Alexandra Petri in The Washington Post -- "Whether letting go of the leash was a calculated, intelligent choice on his part or simply the only option for a man walking two recalcitrant cats, he definitely let go of the leash."
"I thought the moderate did not moderate." That from MSNBC's Chris Matthews. And Howard Fineman from the Huffington Post -- "Jim Lehrer was practically useless as the moderator."
Lehrer responded, "I thought the format accomplished its purpose, which was to facilitate direct, e
