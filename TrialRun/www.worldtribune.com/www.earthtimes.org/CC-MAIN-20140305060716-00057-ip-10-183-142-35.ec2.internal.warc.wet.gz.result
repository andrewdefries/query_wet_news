Air Pollution
>>
Climate Change
There are various issues involved in the long-term change in the distribution of weather patterns that is known as climate change. These include man made climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, ozone depletion, efficient energy use, fossil fuels and their phase-out in favour of renewable energy sources.
Climate Change
>>
Biological Diversity
Biodiversity can be defined as a measure of the comparative diversity among organisms present in a particular ecosystem, biome or planet. However, biodiversity can also be described as the quantity of an environment’s species, genes and ecosystems.
Biological Diversity
>>
Conservation
The conservation movement aims to protect natural resources such as animal and plant species and their habitats. Conservation is a fairly broad term and can be almost interchangeable with the idea of environmentalism or the environmental movement as a whole - it is safe to assume that all environmentalists want to conserve the natural environment.
Conservation
>>
Coral Reefs
Underwater coral reefs are created when corals, which are colonies of tiny living animals, secrete calcium carbonate. Despite being found in waters that provide hardly any nutrients, coral reefs are among the world’s most diverse, albeit fragile ecosystems, being particularly sensitive to water temperature.
Coral Reefs
>>
Deforestation
Pollution, human population growth, our quest for natural resources and agricultural land is devastating forests worldwide. The most serious deforestation issue is tropical rainforest decimation with loss of habitat and biodiversity.
Deforestation
>>
Desertification
Desertification is the process by which habitable and fertile land turns into desert. Desertification can occur as a result of both destructive use of the land by humans and variations in climate, with possible causes including drought, deforestation and overgrazing.
Desertification
>>
Ecosystem
An ecosystem is an integrated biological environment that consists of all of the species that live in a particular habitat. It also includes the non-living, physical components and processes of that environment that the organisms are affected by and interact with, including air, sunlight, soil and water.
Ecosystem
>>
Endangered Species
An endangered species is one that is at risk of extinction. This could be due to insufficient numbers of that species remaining in order to reproduce enough offspring to ensure its survival, while changing predation or environmental parameters can also pose a threat to particular organisms.
Endangered Species
>>
Energy
Issues exist regarding the generation and use of energy, including the environmental impact of energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear power, wind power, solar power and biomass. Related major energy issues include national energy policies, reliance on foreign energy sources and poorer countries’ energy needs.
Energy

Extreme Weather
Extreme weather is the term used to describe historically extreme weather conditions. It is often unseasonal, and can come in such forms as heat waves, cold waves, floods, wildfires, cyclones or tornadoes, with a given event being determined as extreme on the basis of its climatological distribution.
Extreme Weather
>>
Fishing
Fishing is the activity of catching or attempting to catch fish. The long-term sustainability of present levels of fishing has been questioned in recent years due to issues like overfishing, bycatch, fishing discards due to Government quotas and guidelines, climate change, marine pollution and fish farming.
Fishing
>>
Food and Water Security
Food and water security can be defined as the availability to a population of a sufficient quantity and quality of nutritious food and potable water. To be food-secure and water-secure means living neither in hunger or thirst, nor in fear of starvation or severe dehydration.
Food and Water Security
>>
Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering involves the deliberate and somewhat unnatural manipulation by humans of an organism’s genetic structure. This modification results in changes in the affected organism’s characteristics, with one of the most controversial and best-known applications of genetic engineering being genetically modified food.
Genetic Engineering
>>
Global Warming
Details of the effects and consequences that global warming has on planet Earth. These consequences may become unmanageable if action for dealing with global warming continues to be delayed.
Global Warming
>>
Habitat Loss
Habitat loss and degradation involve a natural habitat being rendered functionally unable to support a present species. This process leads to a reduction in biodiversity due to the tendency for the species for which a given site was a natural habitat to be displaced or destroyed.
Habitat Loss
>>
Hydraulic Fracturing
Is hydraulic fracturing an energy revolution and solution to our increasing energy needs or a potentially serious environmental issue that will cause more problems than it solves? Hydrofracking has been linked to earthquakes and water supply contamination but what exactly is the process involved with fracking and shale gas extraction?
Hydraulic Fracturing
>>
Mass Extinction
Mass extinction can be defined as a sudden decrease in the total number of species in a comparatively short time period. There have been five mass extinction events in the last 540 million years that involved the deaths of more than half of all animal species.
Mass Extinction
>>
Natural Disasters
Natural disasters are disasters caused by natural hazards such as floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides or tornados. Natural disasters involve substantial physical damage, injuries and/or loss of life, and occur when natural hazards meet the vulnerability of the affected population.
Natural Disasters
>>
Nuclear Power
There are various environmental issues that concern nuclear power. Although nuclear energy provides environmental benefits, for example in the form of zero carbon dioxide emissions and no notable nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides or particulates, its spent fuel is radioactive and can still cause environmental damage.
Nuclear Power
>>
Oceans
Oceans are very large bodies of saline water that are principal parts of the hydrosphere. Along with smaller seas, oceans make up the continuous body of water that is known as the World Ocean. See below for our guide to the environmental issues associated with oceans and the marine life who inhabit them.
Oceans
>>
Ocean Acidification
Decreasing pH levels in the oceans caused by increased carbon dioxide levels are making oceans more acidic. This acidification process has numerous consequences on marine ecosystems and marine life.
Ocean Acidification
>>
Ozone
The ozone layer protects the Earth from harmful UV radiation. There are holes in this essential barrier, one above the Arctic and the other above the Antarctic caused by human activity polluting the atmosphere.
Ozone
>>
Pollution
Pollution is the process by which harmful substances or products are introduced into the natural environment. Pollution, which can come in the form of chemical substances or energy such as heat, noise or light, causes disorder and instability to ecosystems.
Pollution
>>
Tropical Rainforests
Rainforests are defined as forests that experience heavy annual rainfall. Rainforests are referred to as such if they receive a minimum normal annual rainfall of 1750-2000 mm (68-78 inches), and are generally found close to the sea or in the mountainous regions that receive the most rain.

The Environment
The Earth Times aims to provide you with current environmental news coverage and green blogs to give you the background information needed to better understand what can sometimes be enormously complicated and controversial environmental issues.
Our encyclopaedia or guide to environmental issues and to some extent environmental concerns, is a relatively new addition to the site that we hope will give you the knowledge to understand these global environmental issues in the rapidly changing world around you.
Written to be understandable, without the need to hold a degree in climate change science on the effects of global warming, biology or ecology, The Earth Times Encyclopaedia tries to make sense of these environmental problems, conservation topics and environmental issues that more and more people are becoming engaged and familiar with as they try to make a difference to our planet.
From untangling climate change to helping you find an environmental organization you can be happy supporting we do hope you find The Earth Times Encyclopaedia on environmental issues a useful resource to highlight environmental sustainability for a greener life.
We will be constantly adding to the contents of the encyclopaedia and hope it will complement our environment news when covering any issue relating to nature and the environment. If you do have any suggestions on environment related topics you would like to see added, we would love to hear from you.

Greening our oceans?
After the World Ocean Summit, the long term future is not assured. We can hope that the more positive nations move on aggressively, to combat those people and industries who would violently continue their unthinking habits. Some fishing and eating habits became obsolete when so many species, great and small, started to disappear Fantastic ancient fauna precedes mammal evolution
Animals of unfamiliar as well as familiar types took up niches in the ancient ecosystems, as birds and mammals developed and, of course, feathered dinosaurs ruled the roost! World Ocean Summit Report 2014
How can we protect our coastal, oceanic and even little seas. As we don't often travel on water nowadays, we need to figure just how 'successful' our various pollutions, fish consumptions and farming and of course the limited conservation efforts have been.
