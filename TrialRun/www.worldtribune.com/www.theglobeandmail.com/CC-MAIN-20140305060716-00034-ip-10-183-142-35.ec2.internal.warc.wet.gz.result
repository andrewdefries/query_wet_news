Urgent yet measured, like the onrushing tide, The Impossible is a real-life disaster flick with a compelling twist. The film doesn’t build to the climax, the tsunami that ravaged South Asia eight years ago, but essentially starts with it. In the long denouement that follows, one genre gives way to another, the disaster to a survival tale, and the suspense mounts over the looming question. In this profiled family of five – mother, father and their three young sons – someone must have lived to tell the tale, to put the true into the story. But who? And how?

I recently saw another birthday announcement for a woman turning 50. Her husband had lovingly crafted an original demonstration of his love that you’ve seen a thousand times before; comparing her maturing body to an aging car.Comments about dimming headlights and a droopy rear bumper aside, I’m sure if they’ve been married any length of time they share the humour. Or maybe she blasted him; I don’t know. What I do know is that regardless of how gender-free we like to pretend things can be, cars just aren’t. I’ve always known a disproportionate number of men than women who love their cars. Dream about their cars. Name their cars. Envy others’ cars.

Analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index to increase 3.28 per cent, said Christine Short, a senior manager at S&P Global Markets Intelligence. That’s an improvement from essentially flat profits in the third quarter. (ANDREW KELLY/REUTERS)

Pierre Trudeau’s nationalist vision for the broadcast and telecommunications sector needed a regulator to handle the details. The CRTC’s policies have since made it a target of scorn, sometimes by those it tried to help the most.
Bryan Adams: not Canadian In 1991, the Kingston-born rocker’s hit (Everything I Do) I Do It for You scored a failing 1 out of 4 on the CRTC’s CanCon scale, because it was co-written by a Brit and recorded outside of Canada.
