Motor vehicle traffic collisions are the leading cause of death for Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24.More than 4,000 people are hospitalized every year for treatment of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle crash. People who do not wear their seat belts are 16 times more likely to be killed in a traffic crash than belted occupants.
