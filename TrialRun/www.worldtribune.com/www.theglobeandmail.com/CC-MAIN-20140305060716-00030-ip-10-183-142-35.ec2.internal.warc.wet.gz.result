Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is biting into Britain’s food business with the acquisition of the biscuit company that makes Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels.The $130-billion pension operator said on Monday it has struck a deal to buy Burton’s Biscuit Company, whose roots go back to the mid-1800s.Terms of the transaction were not announced, but St. Albans-based Burton’s has annual sales in the £340-million ($480-million Canadian) range and employs about 2,000 people in three main manufacturing facilities.

For days now, it appeared as if the Pittsburgh Penguins were the favorites to land coveted NHL free-agent Zach Parise. No. Apparently not. On Wednesday, soon after he and Ryan Suter shocked the hockey world by signing identical 13-year, $98-million contracts with the Minnesota Wild, Parise revealed that ultimately his decision came down to either leaving for Minnesota or staying on with the New Jersey Devils.

It probably doesn’t make the Devils feel any better today, but there you have it. Winners of the Ilya Kovalchuk sweepstakes two summers ago, the Devils were the bridesmaids this time around.“I have great friends in New Jersey,” said Parise, on a conference call with reporters. “I’m a loyal person. I loved playing there.”But in the end, the chance to come home and play before family and friends trumped his affection for the Devils organization.“Just the opportunity to play at home, it really meant a lot to me and it meant a lot to my family,” said Parise. “My parents were so excited when they knew I was considering coming back home.“That played a big part in it. I grew up here. I loved coming back here in the summers. I just thought, we enjoy it here so much, it would be great to be here year round.”As for Suter, he said that the Predators, Detroit Red Wings and Minnesota were all under consideration until he made his final decision earlier today. The telephone call, to Predators’ general manager David Poile, to tell him he was leaving Nashville was the most difficult one he ever made in his life, he said.“It was so hard to make that to David,” said Suter. “David has done so much for me. It’s a first-class operation in Nashville and it starts with David.”Soon after making that phone call, he also contacted his long-time defence partner, Shea Weber, and told him he was signing with Minnesota. Weber is a restricted free agent, a year away from unrestricted free agency, and Suter’s departure may have an effect on Weber’s own plans a year from now.“He

Trampolinist Rosie MacLennan won Canada’s first gold medal of the London Olympics, but her dear friend, teammate and Karen Cockburn did not stand on the podium alongside her as the two had always dreamed. Cockburn, full of pride for her friend and sadness at the same time, left the arena, while a beaming MacLennan climbed on to the podium to receive Canada’s first-ever Olympic gold medal in trampoline. A crowd of her family and friends erupted in cheers and waved Canadian flags while the anthem boomed.
