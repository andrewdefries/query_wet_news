For those who decide to go green, the choice now extends to their final resting place.
Woodlands, Canada's first urban green burial site, looks more like a park than a cemetery. It opened in October, 2008 at Royal Oak Burial Park in Saanich, B.C., and those buried there are either wrapped in a shroud or placed in a biodegradable wicker, bamboo, cardboard or untreated wood casket.

What are Winglet Wednesdays? If you’re a WestJet fan following the airline on Twitter or Facebook, you already know it’s not a chicken dinner. That’s when WestJet employees post a photo taken from the window of a plane and invite customers to do the same. Stunning views of the Rockies during descent, bumpy storm clouds and sunsets pour in.
