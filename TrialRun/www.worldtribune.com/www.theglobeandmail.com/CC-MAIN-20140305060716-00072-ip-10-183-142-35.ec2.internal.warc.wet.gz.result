Omar Vizquel’s major-league debut came less than two weeks before Adeiny Hechavarria was born on April 15, 1989.
Now Vizquel, the 11-time Gold Glove winner with 2,841 hits in the majors, has a locker next to Hechavarria’s in the Toronto Blue Jays’ clubhouse. It is Vizquel’s job to mentor the kid some believe can become what Vizquel has been – a measuring stick for all other defensive shortstops.

First, a brief confession. I like Gary Bettman (stop the booing please until I explain). For a lot of reasons, some justified, some not, the NHL commissioner has become the lightning rod for all that ails the game in truest Harry Truman sense of the term. The buck stops at Bettman's door. So for all the gains that the league has made in the five years since the dawn of the "new" NHL, any problems that remain - or have developed as a result of the changes made in the post lockout era - land on Bettman's doorstep.
Last year, the primary issue that caught the public's attention was hits to the head - and the increasing number of NHL players, from the Florida Panthers' David Booth to the Boston Bruins' Marc Savard who suffered serious head injuries in what had previously been a perfectly legal play. Well that had to change - and despite the dinosaur thinking of a handful of GMs, it did. Concussion research from multiple sources pointed out the dangers, short and long term, of repeated blows to the head. Last March, the league implemented a rule change on the fly that made a player guilty of a blindside hit to the head subject to supplementary discipline. It put the onus on the player delivering the hit to pull up if an opponent was in a vulnerable position - as opposed to what they had before, where a defenseless player was supposed to feel contact coming and protect himself. How? Who knows? It never made sense.
Still, this was a proactive rule change - and without getting input from the competition committee of the players' association, supplemental discipline was about as far as the league thought they could go on the matter at the time.
In June, however, the rule was amended further so that now, a blindside hit to the head will result in a major pen
