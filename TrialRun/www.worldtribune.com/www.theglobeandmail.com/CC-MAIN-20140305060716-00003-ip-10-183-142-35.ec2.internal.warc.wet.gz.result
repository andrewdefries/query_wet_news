So now it’s official. After days of frantic diplomatic overtures and in spite of a twenty minute call from President Barack Obama, Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff called off next month’s state visit to the United States. New revelations that her personal e-mail and Web searches were monitored by the National Security Agency (NSA) were apparently the final straw. Her decision not to dine with the American president was designed to send a message and assuage the country’s wounded pride.

There is no doubt that her public rebuke is playing well in the local Brazilian media. To her credit, Ms. Rousseff has manipulated the embarrassment of the NSA intercepts to her benefit. In nationalizing the narrative, she has shifted attention away from her government’s much-maligned handling of the popular protests that shook Brazil in June and July. Ms. Rousseff’s defiant stance may also shore-up her popularity at home after a dramatic decline in recent months. She has an eye firmly on the 2014 elections and her decision to stand up to Mr. Obama will satiate her Worker’s Party base, the members of which are hugely critical of the NSA spying scandal.Even so, her political posturing comes at a cost, and it will do little to reverse the country’s economic slide. The Brazilian economy is floundering at the moment and its business leaders are eager for more American investment and export opportunities. Both Brazil and the U.S. have spent the past several years trying to deepen ties, and more Brazilians are traveling, buying real estate and shopping in the U.S. than ever before. This may partly explain why press statements issued by the President’s office described the visit as “postponed” and likely to “quickly occur” once the dust settles.Some analysts see her decision to call off the visit as a shrewd political move. After all, there were no likely breakthroughs on the horizon for the two giants. Few analysts anticipated any practical dividends emerging from the bilateral talks, noting instead that the “that the potential costs were high, and the benefits were limite

John Heinzl is the dividend investor for Globe Investor’s Strategy Lab. Follow his contributions here. You can see his model portfolio here. One of the great things about dividends is that they’re predictable. I don’t know where stock prices are going from one minute to the next, but I do know, to the day, when dividends will arrive in my account.
