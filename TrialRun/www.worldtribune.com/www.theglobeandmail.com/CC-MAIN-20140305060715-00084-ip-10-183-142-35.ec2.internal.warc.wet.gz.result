Prime Minister Stephen Harper has taken a personal stake in improving the way children are taught on reserves by agreeing to meet collectively for the first time with first-nations leaders - a gathering where education would top the agenda.
Mr. Harper told Shawn Atleo, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, in a recent letter that he is "open to participating" in a Crown-first nation meeting and stressed his commitment to educational reform.

Fortress Paper Ltd. says dumping duties being imposed by China will increase short-term demand and prices for dissolving pulp used primarily to make clothing, but pose a serious danger long term for the sector in Canada, the United States and Brazil.Chief executive Chadwick Wasilenkoff said viscose producers have let their stocks of dissolving pulp deplete in anticipation of the announcement of duties, including the 13-per-cent levy applied to Fortress, Tembec Inc. and two private Canadian producers on the East Coast.
