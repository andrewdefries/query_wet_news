Car and roadside bombs killed at least 43 people in cities and towns across Iraq on Tuesday, police and hospital sources said, extending a spate of violence ahead of next week’s Arab League summit in Baghdad.
The meeting is seen as the country’s debut on the regional stage following the withdrawal of U.S. troops in December and Iraq’s government is anxious to show it can reinforce security to host its neighbours.

The deadliest attack on Tuesday occurred in the southern Shiite Muslim holy city of Kerbala, where twin explosions killed 13 people and wounded 48, according to Jamal Mahdi, a Kerbala health department spokesman.
“The second explosion caused the biggest destruction. I saw body parts, fingers, hands thrown on the road,” 23-year-old shop owner Murtadha Ali Kadhim told Reuters.

Canada Competes
In southern India, the Parnasala – a marble lotus-shaped prayer hall in the state of Kerala – opened in 2010 as a new place of public worship. LED lighting provided by Canada’s GVA Lighting illuminates both the interior and exterior surfaces of the structure. Vladimir Grigorik, GVA’s founder and CEO, says, ‘with my international background and my personal interest in seeing different places and getting to know different cultures, it just made sense that I would want to make international sales.’ (GVA Lighting)
