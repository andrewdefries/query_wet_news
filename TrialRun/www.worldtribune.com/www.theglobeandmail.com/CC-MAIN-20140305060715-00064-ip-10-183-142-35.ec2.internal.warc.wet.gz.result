Lawyers and legal experts urged Nova Scotia’s bar society to deny accreditation to a proposed law school in British Columbia, arguing the university’s policy that prohibits same-sex intimacy is discriminatory. More than two dozen people went before the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society on Thursday to make submissions on whether it should recognize degrees from Trinity Western University in Langley, B.C., a faith-based institution that wants to open a law school in 2016.
