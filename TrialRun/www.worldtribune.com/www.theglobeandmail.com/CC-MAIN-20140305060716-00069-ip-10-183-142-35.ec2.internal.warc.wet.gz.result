FASHION:
Embellished shoulders
Just when you got comfortable wearing exaggerated, space-age shoulders, designers have gone off and added even more layers of finery. At Balmain, Christophe Decarnin opted for metal-encrusted epaulets, while Alber Elbaz added volume with sculptural ruffles to many a Lanvin dress. Then there's the novel shoulder pad-atop-jacket-or-T-shirt look from Pink Tartan's Kim Newport-Mimran. Give them a go: Just draw the line at football-style padding.

Trends deconstructed: chunky men's watches on women
The best (and worst) in fashion and design from 2009
Clogs
Clogs are giving the boot to gladiators, which reigned supreme as summer's must-have footwear for the past two years. Chanel offered milkmaid à la mode with soaring wooden beauties, while Gucci reintroduced the monogrammed style that was so popular in the mid-1990s. A more affordable choice is Swedish Hasbeens, a handmade Scandinavian brand that revels in 1970s quirk. Wannabe farm girls, rejoice.
Spiky accessories
First came barbed wire. Then it was zippers and studs. Now, Givenchy is blazing the way for spikes with a decidedly punk hair band that looked like Lady Liberty crossed with a pit bull. And spotting Rihanna's necklace that alternated pearls with spikes made Ryan Seacrest's New Year's Eve television special worthwhile. The message is clear: metalheads rule.
The trench dress
Let's all give a standing O to Phoebe Philo, the former Chloé designer whose maiden collection for Celine signals an exciting new direction for the French fashion house. In essence, she has reimagined the now-cliché notion of American sportswear - contemporary classic separates - with a fresh Parisian twist. So bring on the liquid leather tees and flattering wide-legged pants. Above all, expect her pared-back trench dress to spawn many a knockoff.
Lingerie as outerwear
Before you start cringing, it's not exposed thongs that have made a comeback, but lingerie-like pieces more refined than racy. Think the peek-a-boo boudoir approach at Dior, the cheeky bras-over-T-shirts from Marc Jacobs and the bloomer twist offered by Canada's Joe Fresh. Best to proceed with caution, though: This look requires serious moxie (not to mention a killer bod) to pull off.
Bleached eyebrows
If you're wondering why models have looked so expressionless of late, it's not Botox: Their bleached eyebrows may be to blame. In what is surely the edgiest makeup trend of the season, Alexander McQueen, Gareth Pugh and Rick Owens are among the designers who featured faces with brows beyond the pale. Before proceeding with the look yourself, consider the inevitable downside: eyebrow roots.
Athletic looks
From perforated leathers at Prada and Ezra Constantine to psychedelic scuba style at Proenza Schouler, fashion is riding a sporty wave for spring. This means that you can look cool and athletic without having to break a sweat, which is a good thing: You wouldn't want to ruin that pricey hooded vest from Balenciaga.
Muted colours
Given the ubiquity of ecru, alabaster, canvas, nude, powdery grey and a wide spectrum of washed-out pastels this season, could an anti-colour conspiracy be at work? After a long love affair with eye-popping hues (and the roller-coaster emotions of a gruelling 2009), we can chalk this more muted palette up to a desire for less intensity. It's about time: All that neon was starting to hurt our eyes.
Stand-alone fragrance shops
Credit the perfume geeks whose scent-savvy blogs have helped to build interest in niche fragrances, which until recently were available only at high-end department stores. Now, such below-the-radar brands as Le Labo, L'Artisan Parfumeur and Frédéric Malle's Éditions de Parfums are opening boutiques from L.A. to Dubai. While they resemble mini art galleries, they are more akin to candy shops for the olfactory crowd (and amateur fragrance fans).
Denim shirts for dudes
Listen up, pardners: This season's denim shirts have little in common with the western-style numbers you might see at a rodeo. The new pack, from the likes of D&G, is more Rodeo Drive. Think fitted, lighter-weight and even work-appropriate. Pair them with khakis, a tie and cardigan or even a suit, but do avoid what's known as the Canadian tuxedo - i.e., a head-to-toe denim ensemble.
DESIGN:
Fretwork patterns
Just as this season's fashion is rife with perforation, so too is the design world consumed with fretwork patterns. Barbara Barry's latest furniture for McGuire, for instance, features exquisite interlaced forms. Such designs are especially suitable for small spaces, offering airiness as well as substance

For more than 50 years now, there has been a quaint ritual performed after most provincial elections in B.C. – the brain trust of the New Democratic Party gathers to hold a debilitating session of second guessing, inevitably leading to harsh denunciations and bitter recriminations, and often ending in political bloodshed.

A company's ability to consistently generate positive cash flows from its daily business operations is highly valued by investors. Operating cash flow can uncover a company's true profitability. It’s one of the purest measures of cash sources and uses, and is the gateway between other reported financial statements.
