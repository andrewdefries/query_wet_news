John (Jack) McLean survived 32 missions fighting the Nazis as a gunner in a heavy bomber and now, almost a lifetime later, it seems, Canada is awarding veterans such as him a special distinction to mark their service.The Harper government took the wraps off a commemorative bar in Ottawa Monday to honour the 50,000 Canadian veterans who served in Bomber Command. Of the 55,000 Allied men and women who lost their lives in the bomber forces, more than 10,000 were Canadian.

Last Christmas Eve, residents of Youngstown, Ohio, were shaken by a rare earthquake, followed by another a week later on New Year’s Eve.
On Friday, the state’s Department of Natural Resources confirmed what many Ohio residents suspected: The earthquakes could be traced to re-injection wells used by oil companies to discard wastewater from shale gas wells, primarily from neighbouring Pennsylvania.
