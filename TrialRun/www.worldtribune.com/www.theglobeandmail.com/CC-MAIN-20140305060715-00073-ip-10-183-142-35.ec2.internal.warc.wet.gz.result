The brief stock market flurry caused by one hacked, fake tweet comes just weeks after the U.S. markets watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, decided to allow public companies to use Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to disseminate news to their investors.The minutes-long multibillion-dollar market collapse, prompted by a fake Associated Press report about an attack on the White House, was exposed as a hoax and markets recovered. Investigations are expected to follow, although an SEC spokeswoman would neither confirm nor deny on Wednesday whether the agency has launched a probe.

But the fiasco highlights the complex problems market regulators face in the social media age – and the potential risks to companies and investors who are increasingly turning to social media.The SEC’s move to clarify its disclosure rules came as it decided not to take action after the chief executive officer of Web video service Netflix Inc. disclosed viewership numbers on his Facebook page instead of through a filing with the SEC or a news release. The SEC said its rules in the area were unclear, and clarified that companies could use social media to disseminate company information, provided they alert all investors they are doing so.Canada’s largest markets regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, has been more cautious. It has not followed the SEC’s lead on the issue, although it recently allowed public companies to post corporate filings on their websites, rather than insisting that such documents be mailed to all shareholders.The ease with which a Twitter account in particular can be hacked, however, should make companies and investors very wary about relying on information from social media, says cyber-security expert Daniel Tobok, head of forensics for telecom giant Telus Inc.For one thing, in most organizations the employee in charge of the Twitter account is usually low ranking, he says, and most Twitter passwords are notoriously weak.“People don’t think much about it: ‘It’s only Twitter, it doesn’t give access to our company,’” Mr. Tobok said. “But it does talk about your company’s [public] profile, which can cause a chain reaction, and a financial impact, at the end of the day.”In the AP case – according to what appeared to be an internal AP memo posted by U.S. media blogger Jim Romenesko – hackers tricked AP employees into clicking on a link in an e-mail that appeared to come from a colleague, a targeted technique known as “spear phishing” that allows hackers to induce people into unknowingly providing passwords or personal information.It’s easy to do, and almost impossible to stop, Mr. Tobok said: “Spear-phishing has to do with human intelligence. No tools, no firewalls can stop it. … When an e-mail comes and says click here and it doesn’t look like it’s from

From a purely optical position, this is the NHL's worst nightmare. Worse than head shots. Worse than concussions. Worse than bankruptcies in unsuitable non-traditional markets. Worse, dare we say, even than Jim Balsillie's unwanted overtures to join the lodge.
When Alex Burrows opened his mouth Tuesday night in the aftermath of a 3-2 Vancouver Canucks' loss to the Nashville Predators to complain about the work of referee Stephane Auger, he said what a lot of people have been thinking for a lot of years:

NHL probes Auger accusations
That NHL referees do hold grudges; they do carry out vendettas; and they can affect the outcome of games with their calls. The third point is perfectly fine by the way, provided a referee's erroneous call is simply an honest mistake.
Anyone that's ever tried to referee a hockey game - at any level, from novice on up - can tell you the unabashed truth: It is much harder than it looks.
You could make the call correctly 100 per cent of the time from the bench, or from the stands, or from your living room couch, after the sixth replay. But try to do it in real time, with all the noise happening around you, all the action, so many bodies to watch - and soon enough you realize that the art of refereeing a game well is difficult and requires a skill set that only a few possess. Sorry, as unpopular as referees can sometimes be, that's the truth.
It is a daunting undertaking - to make a precise judgment in a heartbeat in a game that has never been faster and has so many eyes trained on the outcome of your call.
But the issue of making an honest mistake is far different than what Burrows alleged in the aftermath of the Canucks' loss to the Nashville Predators, an outcome that was directly related to a pair of penalties assessed by Auger in the latter stages - that led to Shea Weber's game-winning power-play goal.
Afterwards, under direct questioning, Burrows was pure raw emotion on display. He revealed that Auger had whispered in his ear during the pre-game warm-up and essentially promised that he'd extract his pound of flesh from the Canucks' winger.
Burrows crime? In a previous meeting between the two teams this season, Auger had assessed a major against the Predators' Jerred Smithson, a penalty that was eventually overturned by the league's hockey operations department because it looked as if Burrows might have dived on the play. In Burrows' version of events, that made Auger look bad in front of his bosses; and this represented the perfect chance to get even.
Auger will eventually get to tell his version of events, but he will be hard-pressed to come up with a viable explanation for why he took Burrows aside for a chat in the pre-game warm-up. To inquire about his health? Not so likely.
Presumably, in the immediate aftermath of the incident, the NHL's first instinct would be to dismiss the thing out of hand and hoped that it just fades. Flamingo justice isn't going to work on an issue as serious as this, a direct challenge to the integrity of the league. In its own way, it is as potentially damaging as the revelations that NBA referee Tim Donaghy was guilty of gambling on basketball games that he worked.
Integrity is the bench mark of what the NHL sells - the notion that any team on any given night can win, fairly and s
