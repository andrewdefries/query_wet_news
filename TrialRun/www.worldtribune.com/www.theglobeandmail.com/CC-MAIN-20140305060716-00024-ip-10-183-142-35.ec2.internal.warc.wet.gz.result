Midway through a conversation that had taken an unexpected turn into the mechanics of New York’s expropriation laws, I mention that this was not the direction I’d expected this interview to take. Micaela Birmingham, on the other end of the phone, laughs amiabl y.“Did you expect to be talking to the bimbo of Canada?”
In truth, I replied, I didn’t know know what to expect.I was on the phone with her in an attempt to suss out the story of “Lena Sutherland,” one of the co-hosts of While The Men Watch, a controversial new offering from the CBC. Offered online, the show is an alternative commentary to Hockey Night In Canada, a long-ad libbed conversation between Sutherland and her best friend Jules Mancuso as they chat through the game. The banter is heavy on boyfriends-and-shopping schtick, and light on, well, sports.“Here comes Rupp!” said Sutherland, giving some sample commentary during an appearance on CBC News Now. “He looks like a woman who’s caught sight of a 50-per-cent off sale! He’s not letting anyone near his size in his shoes!”When the CBC picked up this act and put it in the Hockey Night in Canada stable as an offering for women, it unleashed a firestorm of criticism about the stereotypes it was perpetuating: Women as shopaholics, men as sports nuts; men as the ones who understand what’s going on on the ice, women as uninterested in the technicalities of sports.“The show is essentially the traditional four Fs of pink ghetto journalism – food, family, fashion, and furniture – tangentially tied into hockey,” noted Ellen Etchinham, a Toronto sportswriter, in a critical blog post that was widely circulated. Sutherland and Mancuso responded that it was all in fun, and never meant to be a political statement.Which brings us to the interesting thing about “Lena Sutherland:” She doesn’t actually exist.Lena Sutherland is actually a pseudonym for Birmingham, a real entrepreneur who’s got a lot more on her résumé than her alter ego.

Protests prompted by first-nations frustration with the federal government flared in at least six provinces Wednesday.The “day of action” began quietly, but by lunchtime police in Windsor blocked one of two access roads to the Ambassador Bridge, which is the major trade crossing from southern Ontario to the United States, as protesters massed. A spokesman said the closing should not last long as natives were soon moving to a nearby parking lot.

Soccer’s authorities spent years agonizing over whether to introduce goal line technology, yet its use would not have solved any of the recent refereeing controversies which have blown up in Italy, England and Brazil.Video replays, on the other hand, would instantly have cleared up any doubts, yet they have barely been discussed by football’s rule-makers and remain firmly off the agenda.
The paradox has been highlighted in Brazil where the result of a match has been put under investigation because, although match officials made the right decision, there is a suspicion they used information from television replays to do so.Millions of television viewers were instantly able to see that Palmeiras striker Hernan Barcos punched the ball into the net Diego Maradona-style when he scored against Internacional in the Brazilian championship on Oct. 27.The referee initially missed the incident but, amid outraged Internacional protests, agreed to consult the other match officials and then changed his mind. Internacional went on to win 2-1.Palmeiras , however, claimed officials made their decision after speaking to television staff who had seen the replay and Brazil’s top disciplinary tribunal provisionally declared the result void pending an investigation.It is not the first time officials have been accused of breaking the rules by using replays to make the right decision.There was considerable debate after the 2006 World Cup final that Zinedine Zidane was only sent off for his head-butt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi after the fourth official saw the incident on a TV replay.Several minutes elapsed before referee Horacio Elizondo dealt with the matter and he did so only after Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon drew the assistant referee’s attention to what had happened.But FIFA brushed aside the suspicions, and the possibility that the final would have to be replayed, saying the incident had been ‘directly observed’ by the fourth official Luis Medina Cantalejo from his position at the side of the pitch without the use of a monitor.There was another bizarre episode at the 2010 World Cup, on the same day that Frank Lampard’s disallowed goal for England against Germany prompted FIFA to re-open the debate on goal line technologyA stadium screen replayed Carlos Tevez’s opening goal for Argentina against Mexico 3-1 and, in doing so, clearly showed it should have been ruled offside.Eighty thousand people knew the correct decision within seconds and the Mexican players surrounded the referee urging him to look at the screen but the official had to go by what his own eyes had told him.Other sports have embraced video umpires, notably the two codes of rugby and cricket. In rugby union, for example,
