There’s often a sense of sticker shock when a single option pushes past the $2,000 mark. Perhaps that’s why auto makers like to dress up these big features as option “packages,” to make it seem like you’re getting more than just a rear DVD player or pricey GPS system. With plug-in electric vehicles, ordering up a $2,000+ charger (installed) for your garage is almost mandatory in pure battery electric vehicles, and a popular option for Volt buyers.

Join the conversation with #GlobeNorth.In Canada’s northernmost community of Grise Fiord, another sealift season has ended. The hamlet is now locked in by thousands of square kilometres of sea ice. Luckily for the people of Ellesmere Island’s only community (pop. 130) – once again cut off from the mainland another year – their ship, the M/V Anna Degagnés, has already come in.
