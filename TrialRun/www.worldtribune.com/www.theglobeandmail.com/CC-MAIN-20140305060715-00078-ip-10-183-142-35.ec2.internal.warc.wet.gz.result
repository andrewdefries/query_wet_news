Rashed al-Ali spent two hours hunting for petrol before ditching his car. He then walked to a highway to hail a taxi to try to find any place where he could fill his jerry can with fuel.
His story is part of what has become a typical morning rush hour routine for hundreds of workers in the United Arab Emirates, where petrol stations ran dry last week.
“Between searching and getting through the traffic at the stations, sometimes it takes me two and a half hours to get fuel,” said Mr. al-Ali, 25, who lives in the UAE’s northern region and works in Dubai to the south.
“This problem is making people waste time. I have to wake up extra early to fill gas at a petrol station before I can go to work in Dubai.”
The UAE is the world’s third largest oil exporter, now pumping 2.5 million barrels per day, and its petrol consumption is estimated to be around five million litres per day.

They first blamed it on maintenance work. But analysts say the problem lies in government subsidies, which look increasingly unsustainable as soaring oil prices drive up the cost of supplying fuel to customers at a cheaper, fixed price.
“It is a problem that has been in existence for several years,” a Dubai-based independent analyst said on the condition of anonymity. “This was going to happen at some point. It’s happening now “because the demand is getting higher and the very sharp run up of oil prices since the start of the year.”
RETAILERS IN LOSS
Gasoline is heavily subsidized in the UAE, like other Gulf states, with the federal government setting the price cap. Fuel retailers import their needs from the international market where oil hit a high of $127 (U.S.) a barrel earlier in the year.
Three of the UAE’s four fuel retailers – Dubai-owned Emirates National Oil Co (ENOC), Emirates Petr

Every business wants to grow, but what if getting bigger isn’t part of the game plan? What if your goal is to have a small business, and keep it nimble and manageable? Is there anything wrong with that? Is growth necessary or necessarily a positive thing for every business?There’s nothing wrong with staying small, even if it means passing up opportunities to attract more business and customers.
