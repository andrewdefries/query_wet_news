TWEETCOMMENTEMAILMOREEAST LANSING, Mich. — Tom Izzo loves the camaraderie and unselfishness in his locker room, and he can't quibble much with his team's overall play — the Spartans are 7-0 and will be No. 1 for a third consecutive week Monday after Friday's 98-65 drubbing of Mount St. Mary's.He's already handed out quite a bit of public discipline, though, and the season isn't yet a month old. Friday at Breslin Center, seniors Keith Appling and Adreian Payne and junior Branden Dawson came off the bench because they recently skipped, or were extremely late, for a class they share.BOX SCORE: Michigan State 98, Mount Saint Mary's 65"You get near finals week, there's certain things you've got to take care of," Izzo said. "Unless you're dead, you've got to get it done. Those guys just didn't get something done that I told them they've got to get done and they paid a little bit of a price. It's more than the minutes, it's the embarrassment. That's just the way it's got to be, but they'll get over it, they'll understand it and get better for it."The accountability demands are high early for a coach and team with national championship aspirations, and they led to a starting lineup at a fully packed Breslin Center that served as a preview of next season – Travis Trice, Denzel Valentine and Alvin Ellis III at the guards, Costello and Alex Gauna up front.Sophomore shooting guard Gary Harris was the fourth starter missing, so he could rest a sore ankle that was initially injured in August. Izzo said Harris will start Wednesday's home game against No. 16 North Carolina in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge, though he may be somewhat limited in practice until then.Appling, coming off the bench for the first time since his freshman season, still managed 17 points and five assists and after the game called his benching "a wake-up call."Valentine had a career-high 15 points and seven assists. Trice, making his first career start, collected 15 points and six assists."We got a great game out of Trice," said Izzo of an effort that contributed to team numbers of 28 assists and nine turnovers.The B Team starting lineup was fine offensively but struggled to defend the smallish, driving, shooting Mountaineers (2-6). MSU was up 19-16 when Appling, Dawson and Payne entered the game with 14:12 left in the first half.Will Miller came off the bench to lead the Mountaineers with 15 points on five three-pointers. Mount St. Mary's was 12-for-34 from three as a team, while MSU was 9-for-18.Earvin "Magic" Johnson was in town for the game and took over post-game speech duties from Izzo, who made another statement with another lineup change.Already, redshirt freshman forward Kenny Kaminski has been suspended three games — two exhibition games and the season opener – for not taking care of academic obligations.Dawson came off the bench in the season opener because he was late to a team meeting. And Izzo brought Dawson and sophomore center Matt Costello off the bench for a Nov. 18 win over Portland, as a way to get more basketball effort out of them."He's big on the little things," said Dawson, who had six points and 10 rebounds off the bench.Payne said the three players actually showed up late to the class in question, but acknowledged "it looks terrible" that they came off the bench."He's getting even more on top of it now," Payne said of Izzo. "Just trying to get us ready for the real world. We've got to suffer the consequences. I understand why he did it, I respect him and understand why."Joe Rexrode writes for the Detroit Free PressGALLERY: THE BEST OF THE WEEK IN COLLEGE HOOPSFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInAll the college basketball action this week FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

TWEETCOMMENTEMAILMOREANDERSON, Ind. — Pep Hamilton looked a bit stunned when someone asked the new Indianapolis Colts offensive coordinator whether it would be a good idea for second-year quarterback Andrew Luck to take a few hits in Sunday's preseason opener against the Buffalo Bills."Absolutely not," Hamilton said.The theory is that live contact can somehow help the franchise quarterback get into football shape or some type of rhythm."It's funny," Hamilton added. "When Andrew was in college, when I would approach him and ask him a couple of days prior to the game, 'Hey, give me an idea of what plays you'd like to start with,' he would always say, 'Hey, I want to get hit to knock the butterflies out.'BELL: Norv Turner the right mentor for Brandon WeedenREGGIE WAYNE: Luck now the Colts' 'president'"He would actually do more of the hitting, should I say, if we ran a sprint-out or a roll-out. You could count on him not throwing the football and just tucking it and trying to run over a defensive back or a linebacker. By no means do we employ that strategy at this level."Hamilton has followed Luck in making the jump to the NFL from Stanford, where he was offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach the past two seasons. The anecdote offered by Hamilton provided a clue for the intimate history that he has with his quarterback, while also underscoring his understanding of how to proceed moving forward.PHOTOS: NFL preseason actionFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInPhotos: Best of NFL preseason FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

With a rebuilt offensive line, the Colts are looking to cut down on the sacks after allowing 41 in 2012, fifth-most in the AFC.Given the tight bond he developed with Luck at Stanford, Hamilton was the perfect candidate to replace Bruce Arians, who helped Luck set an NFL rookie record with 4,374 passing yards in 2012 before bolting to become the Arizona Cardinals' head coach.It was such a perfect fit that the job was open for only a matter of days — Hamilton was hired within 48 hours of Arians' departure in January."We had to put our heads together real quick," Colts general manager Ryan Grigson said. "We had to move quick and aggressively. Sometimes, if you wait too long, you'll miss an opportunity. But it was kind of a no-brainer when it came down to it."Hamilton, who played quarterback and launched his coaching career at Howard, previously coached with three teams for seven years in the NFL. He was the Chicago Bears quarterbacks coach before leaving for Stanford but insists that he wasn't pursuing another NFL job until he and Luck talked about the possibility of reuniting.When they were last together at Stanford in 2011, the Cardinal scored a school-record 561points."It's been great," said Luck. "I'm fortunate not to have to learn a completely new offense. I've got a lot of residual information floating around from Stanford, and it all came back quickly. But just knowing his personality, knowing how to communicate with him, that's almost as important as the football side of things."Although Luck has been essential in helping his teammates learn the new playbook, veteran receiver Reggie Wayne maintains that the relationship between the quarterback and the coach is the most important dynamic."Even if me and Pep didn't get along," Wayne said, "as long as he and Andrew get along, I guess that's all that matters."Hamilton describes the transition to his new job as seamless, which can happen when your quarterback knows the offense like the back of his hand."Andrew Luck has a photographic memory, and he's able to retain a lot of information on a lot of things," Hamilton said.The Colts' previous offensive coordinator was a smashing success. Arians served as interim head coach for 12 games as Chuck Pagano underwent chemotherapy treatments for leukemia. Arians helped guide Indianapolis to an 11-5 regular-season mark and playoff berth that earned him coach of the year honors and a shot at a top job.Enter Hamilton."It's our job to help him out," Wayne said. "It worked last year for B.A. Hopefully, we can get Pep a head coaching job."Provided, of course, Hamilton keeps Luck in one piece.***Follow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBellSHARE
