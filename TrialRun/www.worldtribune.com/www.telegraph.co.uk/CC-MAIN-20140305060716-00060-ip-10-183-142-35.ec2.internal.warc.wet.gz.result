Academies given power to hire unqualified teachers
Thousands of state schools will be allowed to hire unqualified staff to teach for the first time because ministers believe the best teachers are “born, not made”. More than half of secondary schools are now academies, according to the Department for Education. Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Tim Ross, Political Correspondent

Under existing rules, all mainstream state schools have had to ensure their teachers held “qualified teacher status” (QTS) after completing officially recognised training. However, the Department for Education announced that academies will be given the same freedom that private schools have to hire anyone they think would succeed in the classroom. Headteachers of academies will be able to employ professional scientists, engineers and musicians, or experienced staff from overseas, who could make excellent teachers but do not have QTS, the government said. Under new contracts announced yesterday, all schools that become academies from November will automatically be given the new freedom to hire staff without QTS. Michael Gove, the education secretary, will also allow all 1,957 existing academies, including around half of state secondary schools, to apply for the same power. Related Articles

Mr Gove was unavailable for comment on his reforms, which are expected to be resisted by teachers’ unions. The education secretary has already clashed with the two biggest teaching unions, the NASUWT and the NUT, over a series of changes that they say amount to an attack on teachers’ pay and working conditions. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: “Independent schools and Free Schools can already hire brilliant people who have not got QTS. “We are extending this flexibility to all academies so more schools can hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before.”
The spokesman said the “vast majority” of teachers were likely to continue to have formal teaching qualifications, and that no existing teacher’s contract will be affected. But the extra “flexibility” should help schools improve more quickly. Officials said schools would continue to be held accountable for the quality of teaching through Ofsted inspection and league tables. Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, a leading independent school, said an unqualified teacher who trains on the job is often better than someone with a postgraduate certificate in education. “I strongly believe that teachers are born not made and I will actively seek out teachers from all walks of life who have the potential to inspire children," he said. “We have 39 teachers without formal teaching qualifications, including me.”
However, Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, representing secondary heads, urged academies to ignore the reforms. “Teaching is a skill, and the idea of employing individuals who have not been given the tools to do a professional job flies in the face of the coalition government's aspiration of creating a high status profession,” he said. “Of course subject knowledge makes a difference but it is no replacement for professional training.”
“This policy change is a retrograde step which ASCL would advise academies to ignore.”
Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, accused the government of a “dereliction of duty.” “All children deserve to be taught by qualified teachers,” she argued. “Parents and teachers will see this as a cost-cutting measure that will cause irreparable damage to children's education. Schools need a properly resourced team of qualified teachers and support staff, not lower investment dressed up as ‘freedoms’.” Stephen Twigg MP, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said: "While we welcome more professionals coming into teaching there need to be clear safeguards and ensure there is adequate training capacity in schools. If there are issues with teacher training and development, they should be addressed head on, not avoided. "These kind of announcements should be presented to Parliament, not sneaked out hours before the Olympics opening ceremony." Education

"Recent improvements in the Region’s economy and its aggressive investment policy have substantially enhanced its investment appeal. We spent several years improving our investment climate and streamlining investment regulations before the first investors started coming in.
"Our priority was to remove the administrative barriers that frightened off potential investors. Today, any company interested in opening up a new production facility in the Region can count on all the necessary support and assistance from its government. "The company and the local government conclude an agreement that clearly details the roles and responsibilities of the parties, lays the necessary groundwork for business development and secures government support, including various tax benefits and privileges.

Manchester United 4 Norwich City 0: match report
Read a full match report of the Premier League game between Manchester United and Norwich City at on Saturday March 2, 2013.

Comments
Real Madrid loom large but Manchester United are still looking after business at home. It took a while to come together but when it did Norwich were swept away by a red tide masterminded by Wayne Rooney. Sir Alex Ferguson, United’s manager, can now direct his full attention to Tuesday’s monumental Champions League showdown with Spanish royalty at Old Trafford knowing he has an iron grip on the Premier League title race.
Shinji Kagawa claimed his first hat-trick for United, with two nimble assists from Rooney, who completed the rout with a majestic finish.
Three goals came in the final 15 minutes as United finally underlined the gulf in class. It also reinforced the gap at the top of the Premier League, United reopening a 15-point lead over Manchester City.
There were other reasons for Ferguson to be cheerful: Robin van Persie showed no ill-effects from last weekend’s hip injury, Michael Carrick was again a controlling influence in his midfield driving seat and United’s increasingly concrete defence returned their fourth successive league clean sheet.

“We showed a good spirit in our game, we were determined, worked hard and didn’t think about what’s going to happen on Tuesday, they all contributed in a big way,” Ferguson said.
The United manager also praised Kagawa, a £12 million Japanese import from Borussia Dortmund last summer, who became the first Asian player to score a Premier League hat-trick. “Great intelligence on his first one, his second goal was so composed and the third one was really well executed,” he said.
Rooney was industrious all game but hit a different plane in the final 15 minutes.
“He’s missed a few games but he worked hard, scored a goal and that’s how we need him,” Ferguson added.
Ryan Giggs, United’s evergreen grandmaster, was given the day off, leaving his 1,000th senior appearance to garnish Tuesday’s glittering night. Flu victim Rio Ferdinand was also omitted while the likes of Rafael, Nani and Ashley Young had a watching brief from the substitutes’ bench.
But there is still a title to be won, and the majority of the team who started on Saturday can expect to see action against the Spanish giants.
Norwich were the last side to overcome Ferguson’s men, 16 games ago, but even given United’s Champions League distractions this always seemed a step too far for a side who have won only once away from home in the league this term. Sure enough, they were quickly penned in their own half, with Grant Holt a lone and underused outlet up front.
They did, through a mix of hard graft, in-depth defending and their hosts’ failure to find a finishing touch, survive until the end of the first half, though only the bravery of goalkeeper Mark Bunn, who hurtled from his line to smother the ball at Van Persie’s feet after a fine pass from Rooney, prevented them falling behind earlier on.
It was only a matter of when United opened the scoring, and the moment arrived as the clock ticked into first-half added time. Antonio Valencia’s cross reached Van Persie, whose touch helped the ball on to Kagawa, who finished stylishly from 10 yards.
There was little for Old Trafford to get agitated about, but seconds before half-time Patrice Evra was left writhing after a heavy challenge from Norwich’s Robert Snodgrass. Evra, whose duties on Tuesday will include dealing with the fearsome threat of Real’s Cristiano Ronaldo, was left clutching his left ankle while referee Neil Swarbrick brandished a yellow card at Snodgrass. United’s ire was calmed, however, as Evra continued for the rest of the afternoon.
Norwich deserve credit for some adventure, however, discomforting United more than once after the interval. The home side had a major let-off on 62 minutes when Holt’s knock-down left Russell Martin with a gaping target only for the visitor to blaze over.
Restless Old Trafford wanted the comfort of a second goal but Rooney screwed a low shot wide when well placed. Never mind. With the England striker around there is always the capacity for a moment of match-settling magic, and Rooney duly delivered in the 76th minute.
Bursting down the right flank, he could have drilled a shot goalwards but instead checked inside Sébastien Bassong and slid the perfect pass for Kagawa, who rolled the ball calmly beyond Bunn. The match won, United turned on the style. Rooney and substitute Danny Welbeck, who had replaced Van Persie midway through the second half, cued up Kagawa to complete his hat-trick. Rooney, fittingly, had the last word when the provider turned deliverer in the 90th minute with a coruscating drive from outside the penalty area. Now for Real Madrid.
