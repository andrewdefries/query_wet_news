Army recruits killed as train derails in Cairo Nineteen young military conscripts were killed when the train carriages they were came off the rails outside Cairo, the second major disaster to hit Egypt's railways in less than two months.

Follow The crash happened in Giza governorate just south of Cairo, when the rear two carriages of a civilian train being used to transport more than 1,300 conscripts to Assiut in southern Egypt came uncoupled on Monday night.
In mid-November, 51 young children on a school trip were killed when their bus was hit by a speeding train at a level crossing. Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood president, came under fire over that accident and this latest example of the country's crumbling infrastructure will make calls for Mr Morsi to pay attention to its economic crisis as a matter of urgency even louder.

After the latest crash, the driver of the train, who according to local media insisted that it had been passed fit for travel before he set off, and the maintenance engineer were both detained pending "routine" questioning.
Like many of Egypt's basic services, its ageing railways are badly in need of an overhaul. A new transport minister was only appointed last week in the latest of many government reshuffles since the revolution of nearly two years ago.

However, with the Egyptian pound sinking fast against the dollar, foreign exchange reserves running out and a big budget deficit, the government is rapidly running out of money. It is negotiating a $4.8 billion dollar (£3 billion) loan from the International Monetary Fund, but this has been put off a number of times, most recently amid protests against Mr Morsi's seizure of emergency powers last November.Critics say the Muslim Brotherhood, which controls not only the presidency but also the upper house of parliament, is too focused on implementing its conservative view of society to be focused on Egypt's economic problems.
It may also be reluctant to announce much needed structural reforms - on which the IMF loan depends - until after the lower house elections, due in the spring. They will almost certainly entail tax rises and price rises.
On Tuesday, Essam el-Erian, the vice-head of the Brotherhood's front party, the Freedom and Justice Party, issued a statement saying that funding rail development would now be a priority.

Melbourne Cup 2012: Green Moon wins Australia's richest race as European favorites struggle at Flemington
A distinct lack of pace was blamed for the largely disappointing European showing in the Emirates Melbourne Cup, which was won by Green Moon.

Those who believed that an English trainer named Dunlop would be part of the Emirates Melbourne Cup success story at Flemington on Tuesday were dead right. But it did not pan out quite as expected as Green Moon, a 19-1 chance locally, outsprinted his rivals to register an impressive win in Australia's showcase race under Hong Kong-based jockey Brett Prebble. Ed Dunlop saddled the well-fancied Red Cadeaux, who finished eighth in the 24-runner field after being totally unsuited by a lack of pace in the middle stages. The Dunlop connection was provided by Harry Dunlop, Ed's brother, who had trained Green Moon in Britain for his first eight starts before the Montjeu colt was bought privately by prominent owner Lloyd Williams through bloodstock agent Hubie de Burgh and shipped to Australia. Williams, who was winning the Melbourne Cup for the fourth time as an owner, has been a prolific buyer of proven European racehorses over the years, including the Ascot Gold Cup winners Longboat (with Kerry Packer) and Enzeli. But this was his first triumph with one of his recruits from that part of the world. Related Articles

Green Moon had been owned and bred in Britain by Ben Goldsmith, whose father Sir James Goldsmith is remembered in the racing world as the breeder of Montjeu, who died earlier this year. In a thrilling finish to the Melbourne Cup, run in front of a crowd of 106,000 which included the Prince Of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Green Moon held off the strong-finishing Fiorente, who was making his Australian debut after being bought out of Sir Michael Stoute's Newmarket stable. The winning distance was one length. The Marco Botti-trained Jackalberry fared best of the five-strong British contingent by finishing third, but Mount Athos, who did the better of the two Luca Cumani runners, looked unlucky as he flew home for fifth after being bumped on the home bend. Cumani's other runner, My Quest For Peace, came in 10th, while Godolphin's Cavalryman finished 12th. The pace, or lack of it to be more precise, was a common complaint among the visitors. Ed Dunlop said: "Any one of 15 jockeys would tell you there was no pace. He (Red Cadeaux) had to drop in anyway. The jockey was pleased with him but he could not make up the ground." Cumani commented: "The race was run in a strange way. Mount Athos was a bit further back than we would have wanted, given the race was run so slowly." However, the overall time, just over 3mins 20secs, was respectable, and Moutn Athos's sectional for the final half-mile very impressive. The French-trained topweights, Dunaden (14th) and Americain (11th), never looked a chance, while Dermot Weld felt the ground was too quick for Galileo's Choice, who finished 20th. Horse Racing
