Restoring historic listed buildings: James Mott gives his expert conservation advice

As anyone entering this year's English Heritage Angel Awards will know, restoring historic buildings and sites is time-consuming and costly. Mr Mott, who has 24 years experience in the heritage sector, says some insider tips could help restoration projects avoid common pitfalls. The first step is to find a planning lawyer, who will have expertise in the application process and the planning authority. "On more complicated projects, particularly if they are within conservation areas, the first port of call ought to be a planning lawyer, who will understand the local authority and be able to advise as to what the most likely scenario is," Mr Mott said. "Planning lawyers are quite difficult to come across but they are specialists. Related Articles

"We also always recommend an independent survey. There's a big difference between the bank surveyors for mortgages and independent listed building surveyors. They don't cost a fortune - typically £750 plus VAT for a two to three bedroom terrace. "Mortgage companies are looking at what the house is worth whereas these surveys are very detailed. "You would then get a 20-page report and it would include a brief summary of costs. It's really very revealing. It is very important to find out what you are going to be in for."
Mr Mott, who founded ProjectBook, a vetted register of craftsmen and contractors, said it was a common mistake to think listed building consent applied only to the outside of the property. It applies to the whole structure. Another subject often overlooked is conservation areas, which can include rules known as Article 4 directions that restrict changes to doors, windows and railings and other features within a designated area. And when it comes to funding, reduced VAT rates may apply to alterations to a building but full VAT rates can be added to repairs. "Obviously, doing these things is a labour of love," Mr Mott added. "It's about Britain's long love affair with the past and I think people see it as a challenge."

Think Tank: How to act in time of crisis
When O2’s mobile phone network crashed last July leaving thousands of users unable to receive text messages or phone calls, customers were quick to react, taking to Facebook and Twitter to express their anger and frustration. Social media provides an emotionally devastating alternative to the human connection Photo: Alamy	By Rachel Bridge
8:37PM BST 22 Jun 2013
Comments
Instead of responding to customers’ complaints in a formal corporate way, however, the team at O2 decided to use humour to defuse the situation by replying to complaints with cheeky and funny – and occasionally risqué – tweets. It also posted a picture on its Facebook page of a squirrel saying sorry. The novel approach worked. Customers loved the irreverent tone of voice O2 had adopted and by the time the problem had been resolved, O2 had gained 60,000 new followers on Twitter. Nicola Green, O2’s director of communications, said: “Nobody wants a crisis, but to come out of a crisis like that having net positive sentiment within our social media was just amazing. People went from being very upset and annoyed with us to joining in the conversation and becoming our brand ambassadors.”
Forget everything you thought you knew about crisis management because social media has changed all the rules. These days, when disaster strikes it is no longer enough to simply put out a press release and hope for the best. You have to go to where your customers are and show them you are in control of the situation.
Richard May, a director of Spotter, a social media monitoring agency, said: “Social media has expedited the spread of a crisis. The days when a company could try to control the message through the traditional channels has gone out of the window because now everybody has a voice. A lot of companies don’t have any idea what is being said about them on social media and it puts them at a huge disadvantage.”

What’s more, while in the past customers may have been prepared to wait patiently for a company to get back on its feet, the ease with which they can find alternative products or services via the internet means that loyalty can no longer be relied on.
Dominic Cockram, managing director of Steelhenge, a crisis management consultancy, said: “Customers will quickly move somewhere else if they feel there is a crisis going on and they are not going to get what they want. There is also a feeling that if you are having a crisis then maybe you are not running your business very well.”
The problem is that getting it wrong can be terminal. According to insurance industry research, 80pc of SMEs affected by a major incident close down within 18 months, and 90pc of those that lose their data are forced to close down within two years.
Disasters affecting SMEs can range from IT systems crashing to fire, flood or theft damaging premises; from reputational crises such as food contamination to questionable conduct by directors or employees. The problem is that, despite many cautionary tales, many SMEs still do nothing about managing a crisis until they are actually in the thick of one. Research commissioned by the British Insurance Brokers' Association found that less than half of the 750 SMEs asked had any kind of continuity plan in place, while a survey by AXA, the insurance firm, found that only 39pc of SMEs have business interruption cover.
The good news is that there is much you can do in advance to mitigate the effects of an unexpected crisis.
First, draw up a contingency plan. Get your management team to discuss worst-case scenarios that could affect the business. Then prioritise what would need to be done in the event of a crisis – and who will be responsible for doing it.
Remember that you may need to find temporary accommodation, extra staff to man phone lines, new supplies, new equipment and emergency funds to foot the bill for all of the above.
From this, create an action plan document which includes practical details such as essential telephone numbers, a plan of the workplace with technical details and information about where to meet – a local hotel, for example – if the workplace is inaccessible.
If disaster does strike, your communication strategy will be key. Appoint an articulate spokesperson, be honest about what has happened and explain what you are doing to fix the problem. Give a consistent message – what you say on Facebook, on your website and on any media outlets (if it gets that far) have all got to match. Above all, act fast, otherwise misinformation and speculation will quickly fill the void. Finally don’t forget to tell your staff what is going on. When a crisis hits they are often the last to know, which can create resentment. Rachel Bridge is an author, public speaker and journalist specialising in entrepreneurship and SMEs

Comments
How did your childhood experience affect your attitude to money?
I had a great upbringing and I never wanted for anything. My parents are very normal, middle class and are very careful with money, so we went on one summer holiday a year, three weeks over August, and we lived in a nice house, but we had to be careful. By no means was there money sloshing around. There was always a budget, which I probably have forgotten about, but that was definitely our background. I remember being given £1 for pocket money and thinking when I got to the age of about 13, "I cannot live on this." I sat down my father and said "I really need more pocket money" and he was like "OK, I'll give you an allowance", but it had to cover everything, including all my clothes, so that was my opportunity to manage my own money or save it.
Only children are often spoilt by their parents. Was that your experience?
A lot of people presume only children are spoilt, but no, I don't think I was spoilt. I can say that hand on heart.
What was your first job and can you remember how much you were paid?
I was a Saturday girl at Marks & Spencer and we used to pride ourselves that we got paid more than my friends at Tesco. I think it was probably about £4.80 an hour, which wasn't a lot but I had nothing to spend it on. It used to add up quite nicely.
What was your starting salary on your first broadcasting job?
I did a postgrad in journalism, so my first full-time job – rather than freelancing, which I did loads of – was working for a company called The Money Channel. It lasted for about 18 months and it was a typical dotcom boom and bust, but I loved it. I think my starting salary was about £17,000.

Why life's more expensive for the super-rich
25 Jun 2013
You've since worked for all the major news broadcasters including BBC, CNBC, GMTV, Sky and now Channel 5. Do the rates differ wildly?
There's a market rate, so no. I have an agent, and they're very clued up about the market rate, so everyone's pretty competitive.
Did reporting for The Money Channel help you deal with your own finances more effectively?
What I have taken away from that was a better understanding of risk, especially around 2008 when it was all "Isn't life great?" and then it all went wrong. There's no such thing as a free lunch and I probably think that more. I'm not a massive spendaholic but I'm probably now more cautious or more aware of having to be a bit more careful and plan for the future financially, whereas in my twenties I wasn't as much. Covering markets, you realise that if you're not prudent and a little bit frugal then you can end up in trouble later.
Would you describe yourself as a spender or a saver?
Probably a spender, unfortunately. I do my best at the moment to save, but honestly I find it very difficult. I don't know where it goes.
Have you blown your wages on exotic holidays or an expensive handbag habit?
No, I just find city life to be expensive. The lifestyle of my friends who don't live in a big city is very different. The opportunity to spend money is everywhere. You walk out of your front door to get onto the Tube and you walk past the coffee shop on the way into work and buy a lunch and you can spend a lot of money just on buying a sandwich or something. Then there's always drinks and dinner after work. So just by going to work and living in London, you end up spending so much more than I think I would if I had a different lifestyle. I have two little tan Jack Russells and they're very expensive.
Do you dress them in silk waistcoats and feed them caviar?
Buying them wasn't expensive. It's maintaining them. Because I work relatively long hours, I have a dog walker and it's incredibly expensive. It's worse than nursery. It's £15 a dog for an hour-long walk, which is probably quite competitive in London. Sometimes I have to go off to do an interview or go in to work a full day, I've got other stuff going on, and that will be two dog walks in that day. Then it all starts to add up; it's probably about £150 per week.
Does money make you happy?
Money makes life easier. To live in a world where you didn't have to worry about your next job and how you're going to pay your mortgage, which is now 17 years long, if those concerns were taken away from me then it would make my life less stressful and easier, but I genuinely don't think money makes me happy.
So have you been at your happiest when you've been earning most money?
No. I've been made redundant twice and the fear of losing my job I found far worse than the actual process of it. In that period of time when I was out of work I was still freelancing, but didn't have a regular bound contract. I actually really enjoyed myself and I was able to do different stuff. It was fine in the end, but I think for me, speaking at my age, I really enjoy job security. I feel happier in life if I've got a nice contract in front of me, like a couple of years.
What are the biggest lessons you've learnt about money?
That it's very easy to spend and very good to save, but it takes forever to save and only minutes to spend.
As a freelancer do you put by your tax money religiously each month or scramble it together at the last minute?
I've got an accountant who's quite strict. That's always taken care of, so I just give myself a monthly allowance. So that's all quite organised actually.
Apart from property, what is your most extravagant purchase?
Probably buying my car. Is that a bit boring?
Not if it's a Lamborghini …
No. It's a BMW X3.
No impulsive buys you immediately regretted?
I once saw a Damien Hirst, a skull with the diamond teeth, about 10 years ago. I think it was £4,000 or £5,000 and I didn't buy it and I've been thinking about it since because I should've done. It would've come up in value massively, wouldn't it? One thing I wish I hadn't bought was this ridiculous MaxMara yellow skirt for about £500, which I only wore once and it's absolutely disgusting; a total and utter waste of money.
Have you been more prudent with property investment?
I have, but it's been nothing to do with me and my shrewd financial moves. I've just been lucky in London. I bought my flat in Fulham when I was 25, so I was lucky enough to get that quite young. It was a two-bedroom garden flat, really lovely, and I bought it in 2003 for £400,000, which was still a lot. It actually went below £400,000 at one point at the crash, but I sold it last summer for £650,000, so I was lucky. I've now moved farther west into a bigger property for about the same price, which I'm now spending most of my disposable income on doing up. I've also got a managed property in Cape Town, which is rented as a holiday let for two thirds of the year and used by friends and family for the rest of the year. It just about breaks even and property prices have remained stable since I bought it. But if I can keep it that long, it could be a great part of my pension.
Any other investments?
No, that's it. Those two, and I have a pension – I stopped paying into it just as the stock market started rising, and then I restarted as the market started to fall, so my timing is brilliant. I don't have a share portfolio because I just don't have the time or discipline and that's what you need in order to manage it properly.
Do you give to charity?
There's this fantastic charity called SOS in Cape Town and I'm an ambassador for it. I give a monthly contribution to it and I've spent a couple of days with them, seeing what they do. It's great to know hopefully that my money's going to help.
Are you a generous tipper?
I usually just take what's on the bill as the recommended amount. So that's it, I'm afraid. Not that generous.
Do you gamble?
I quite like going horse racing. I really enjoy the races. I haven't been very much this year, but I went through a phase of going a lot. I quite like buying the Racing Post and looking at the form, and the most I've ever won is £600 on an accumulator at Ascot.
What do you like least about dealing with money?
I've never particularly enjoyed looking at my bank statement. I've always had that dread when you look at the ATM and press the button for how much you have got in there, or when you read your statement, or checking online and going through all the motions. That process has never been good for me.

All these smoking bans have left me fuming
The experts who want us to stop lighting up in cars are malicious meddlers.
Fuming: the British Medical Association would like smoking in cars to be banned Photo: ALAMY	By Graeme Archer
8:13PM GMT 16 Nov 2011
Comments
In my late twenties, if work was getting me down, I would resort to a pharmacological intervention. I don’t mean taking “happy pills”: instead, I would book a day off, buy myself a copy of The Daily Telegraph and a packet of cigarettes, and take refuge in The Rose of Denmark.
The Rose was a comfortable but slightly down-at-heel pub in Bow: gezellig, in the beautiful Dutch word. There I would drink a pint of cold beer, read the paper, and smoke a few fags. I was quite aware that smoking was a damaging activity. There’s nothing particularly beneficial about beer, either – but the combination of nicotine, alcohol and the sense engendered by a quiet East End pub that nothing much changes, so it’s not worth worrying about the future, would combine to restore my equanimity in short order.
How far away those harmless pleasures seem now. While I’m sure the British Medical Association is happy that I now go swimming when I’m stressed, rather than smoke, it’s only because The Rose of Denmark – along with every other pub in Bow that I remember – is gone, done in by the determination of the last government to make smoking in pubs a crime. No matter that nearly everyone in the Rose was a smoker. No matter that it was a private establishment, and that no one who lived in terror of passive smoking was forced to go inside it. No matter. It’s gone.
Few political acts have made me so angry, since few others seemed so obviously driven by malice: how dare working-class people take respite from daily life by smoking in pubs! If it was, as claimed, the hypothetical risk of passive smoking that kept the anti-smoking obsessives from pubs, tell me – why didn’t they flock to the likes of the Rose of Denmark once its interior had been made suitably pristine for their fussy little lungs? No: the anti-smoking lobby saw poor people enjoying themselves in a manner deemed not sufficiently healthy, and banned it.
And now, the campaigners are back: some people, they’ve noticed, have been smoking in their own cars. And other people might be in the car with them! So we need a new law, and a new set of criminals to prosecute – because, honestly, there’s nothing more important for either the political class or the medical establishment to be thinking about just now, right?

Doctors demand ban on smoking in private cars
16 Nov 2011
“Every year in England,” said Dr Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA’s director of professional activities, “there are over 80,000 deaths that are caused by smoking. This figure increases to a shocking six million worldwide.” Let’s leave aside Dr Nathanson’s bizarre job description (demanding that new crimes be added to the statute book is a “professional activity” for a physician?) as well as her wide-eyed wonder at the fact that, since more people live outside the UK than within it, then more people die abroad, too.
Instead, we could play the game in the way that she undoubtedly would like, and ask her: yes, but how many of those smoking-related deaths are due to smoking in cars? But we shouldn’t. Because if we do, she’ll demand taxpayers’ money to fund a bit of pseudo-scientific guff that will “prove” her point entirely. At this point, liberal-Left politicians will decide that “the evidence” for a change in the law is so overwhelming that essentially, only those morally equivalent to child-murderers could possibly be opposed to it.
You might wonder how – were the ban to be introduced – it could be policed. Well, Oxford City Council has the answer to that. It plans to force CCTV into every taxi in the city, in order to record every conversation between driver and passenger. (I pity the official who had to review my conversations: it’s bad enough that the poor cabbie has to listen to me wittering on, without council officers having to listen in as well.)
Why not take it one step further, and insist on CCTV in every vehicle? Indeed, why stop there? (I doubt the BMA will.) Why not put cameras into every house, so that functionaries from the BMA’s Professional Activities Division can monitor our every move? You could even make it two-way, so that Dr Nathanson’s acolytes can bark out instructions every time some foolish little person tries to have a cigarette, or pours a second glass of wine.
Dr Nathanson added that “the current UK Government prefers voluntary measures, or 'nudging’, to bring about public health change, but this stance has been shown to fail time and time again”. In other words: “stupid people won’t do what I tell them”. Good. But don’t worry, Dr Nathanson. Even if I owned a car, your cardiovascular health would never be put at risk – because I’d never let you in it. I don’t think I could bear to be passively exposed to your joyless moral superiority.

Andy Murray claims he is in a 'better place mentally' ahead of Sunday's Wimbledon final
Andy Murray admitted after his epic semi-final victory that this Sunday's final against Novak Djokovic will be a battle but that he was in “a better place mentally” than last year to claim the title.

Asked his thoughts on taking on Novak Djokovic in a rematch of this year’s Australian Open final which Murray lost, the British No 1 said: “Tough match. I mean, him and Del Potro played an incredible match today. “I saw some of the stuff – they were playing great rallies and moving very well. It will be tough. "I’ve only played him once on the grass before, at the Olympics last year, and I’ll take that thought in my head when I play him on Sunday.” At that meeting Murray defeated Djokovic 7-5, 7-5 to reach the gold medal match against Roger Federer. He and the Serbian were close on the junior tour, but Murray said he now has more of a “professional friendship” with the world No 1. Related Articles

“I still message him sometimes. We spend a lot of time discussing various issues in tennis and doing what’s best for the sport but I don’t think it goes more than that right now. "I hope when we finish playing it would be different but it’s just hard, because playing in big matches there’s a lot on the line and you can’t be the best of friends when that’s happening.”
Of their game styles, Murray said he and Djokovic were similar in their strong returns. “It’s probably the strongest part of our games. We both play predominantly from the baseline, we both move well, but it’s a different type of movement. "I probably move with more power and he’s much more flexible than me.” Comparing his mind set to that of last year’s final, which he lost to Federer, he said: “I think I’ll probably be in a better place mentally. "I would hope so. Because I’ve been there before and I’ve won a grand slam I would hope I’d be a little bit calmer going into Sunday. “This year’s been a little bit different for me because there’s been a lot of expectation. I was almost expected to get to the final from early on in the tournament. Last year when I won my semi I was very, very emotional. "Today I was just delighted to come through and have another chance at playing a Wimbledon final.” Despite the gruelling nature of his semi-final, Murray had time for some jokes. Asked what he thought Fred Perry would say to him now, he joked: "He'd say, 'Why aren't you wearing my kit',"
And in a referance to Djokovic's visits to a Buddhist temple after games, he concluded his press conference by saying he watches TV comedy to relax, adding: "I don't go to temple". Andy Murray
