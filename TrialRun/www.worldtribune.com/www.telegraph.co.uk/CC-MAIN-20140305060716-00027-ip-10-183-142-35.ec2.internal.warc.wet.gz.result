Asset managers hit by market woes
Aberdeen Asset Management and Ashmore were hurt as the FTSE 100 tumbled.

The sharp falls in stock markets around the world were bound to put asset management firms on the back foot, but Goldman Sachs ensured they were among the heaviest fallers by raising broader concerns about companies that run money. In a timely research note on the asset management industry, experts at the bank argued the recent trend for net outflows in equity and bond funds – amid greater market volatility – had prompted them to temper their stance on the sector. "The value of many financial assets – especially those in emerging markets – has also declined recently, potentially implying negative asset returns for some fund managers in the second quarter of 2013," the analysts said. The Goldman experts singled out Aberdeen Asset Management and Ashmore for downgrades, cutting both to “neutral” from “buy”. They were targeted because of their exposure to turbulent emerging markets, the analysts said, with low seeding activity – the start-up of new funds – an additional concern at Aberdeen. Shares in Ashmore dropped 32.7, or 9.1pc, to 325p – the fourth biggest faller in the FTSE 250 – and Aberdeen suffered the third-heaviest blue-chip loss, slumping 31½ to 368½p, a 7.9pc decline.

Still, one beneficiary of the increase in market volatility is likely to be inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon as transaction volumes are expected to increase, the analysts argued. They raised their rating on Tullett to “buy” and the mid-capper rose 12½ to 305p. Peer ICAP edged up 1.1 to 365.3p. Indeed, there was certainly plenty of market turmoil today. Traders, it transpired, were right to fear what US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke had to say on Wednesday evening. His confirmation that the Fed would soon start tapering its quantitative easing (QE) programme, which helped drive the FTSE 100 to a 13-year high only last month, sparked a global sell-off. Dealers in London joined the fray as soon as the market opened and the benchmark index, which dipped on Wednesday amid nervousness ahead of Mr Bernanke’s statement, closed 189.31 points lower at 6,159.51, a 3pc drop that was its worst daily fall since September 2011. Not a single blue-chip company ended the day in positive territory. The Fed was not solely responsible for sending markets lower, however. Weak manufacturing data and a spike in money market rates in China – the world’s biggest buyer of industrial metals – further unnerved investors. That dragged on the London-listed miners. Antofagasta slid 45 to 824½, Glencore Xstrata cheapened 14.6 to 292.7p, and BHP Billiton declined 83½p to £17.28½. The precious metals producers were the hardest hit, hurt by the slump in the spot price of gold – bolstered in recent years by QE that increased inflation worries. Polymetal shed 73½ to 541p, Fresnillo fell 84½ to 960½p and Randgold Resources closed 348p lower at £42.96. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who modelled the impact of falling gold prices on free cash flows, piled further pressure on the yellow metal diggers. Should gold hit $1,200 dollars an ounce, Petropavlovsk, off 13.9 at 130.1p, Hochschild Mining, down 10.4 at 191.4p, and African Barrick Gold, 4.7 worse at 118p, “could struggle to maintain their current level of cash dividends”, the BAML experts said. Elsewhere on that index, troubled coal producer New World Resources, hurt by an extremely bearish analyst note on Wednesday, lost a further 14.4, or 18pc, to a new record low of 65.6p, adding to the 12.5pc fall suffered a day earlier. The company, along with Petropavlovsk, is to be demoted from the mid-cap index after the close tomorrow, which means funds that track the FTSE 250 have to sell the shares. The mid-cap index itself plunged 342.98 to 13,667.38 today. It was not all doom and gloom. Among the second-liners, Ted Baker surged 230p to an all-time high of £17.00 after impressing investors with a 32.7pc rise in revenue during the 20 weeks ending June 15. Ashtead, the equipment rental group, advanced 31½ to 658½p after posting a 60pc jump in full-year pre-tax profits to £215.5m. Microchip designer Imagination Technologies, however, declined 17.8 to 306.4p amid growing concern about the threat posed by US rival Nvidia, which disclosed on Wednesday that it planned to sell licences for its graphics technology. Analysts at UBS, who rate Imagination a “sell”, said that Nvidia would become “a direct competitor in the graphics [intellectual property] market”. Others argued ARM Holdings, down 36½ at 799p, could also be hurt by the arrival of fresh competition. Outside the FTSE 250, there was a touch of bid excitement in New Britain Palm Oil (NBPO), which operates plantations in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Kulim, the Malaysian company that already holds a stake of approximately 49pc in NBPO, offered to boost its holding by snapping up a further 30m shares at 550p each in a partial takeover, pushing the London-listed company 32½ higher to 512½p. The proposed price for the 20pc stake represents a premium of 14.6pc to Wednesday’s close that Sophie Jourdier, analyst at Liberum Capital, described as “relatively low”. Arguing that the offer was not particularly attractive, she said that Kulim could be trying to take advantage of soft palm oil prices and NBPO’s recent production difficulties. Markets

The best river cruises for 2014
A river cruise can take you right to the heart of a country – and there’s an itinerary to suit every taste

One of the biggest differences between an ocean cruise and a river cruise is that the former takes you to countries, while the latter takes you through countries, making river cruising in many ways a more immersive experience. And with itineraries to match every interest or passion there’s no compromise on choice. Here’s our round-up of the best in a selection of popular holiday categories. Scenic splendour
The serene Moselle (below) meanders through a picture-book landscape of vineyard-clad hills and a succession of half-timbered medieval towns and villages. New kid on the dock, Emerald Waterways (0800 270 7017; emeraldwaterways.co.uk) offers a 12-day Rhine and Moselle cruise on Emerald Sky departing on April 15, 2014 (from £1,945 per person).

There’s show-stopping scenery, too, on the Danube’s 1,777-mile sweep across Europe from Black Forest to Black Sea, most notably in the Wachau Valley between Melk and Krems, where church spires, castle turrets and abbey towers soar and cultivated terraces spill down mountain slopes. Most itineraries offer optional excursions to Melk Abbey, for views from its clifftop terraces. The River Cruise Line (0844 544 6437; rivercruiseline.co.uk) has a 10-day round-trip cruise from Passau on Serenity from £949pp. The Danube flows through the Wachau Valley, Austria
Other scenic highlights include the Danube Bend – the river’s sharp turn south as it approaches Budapest; and the dramatic Iron Gates Gorge beyond Belgrade. When it reaches the Black Sea the Danube fans out over a vast, reeded delta, threaded with lakes and rich in bird life. Bend, gorge and delta feature on a Saga (0800 506066; travel.saga.co.uk) 16-night Danube Delta Odyssey on Filia Rheni II, departing May to August 2014 and costing from £2,599pp. City sightseeing A cruise on the less-travelled Elbe will reward you with Dresden and its unsung treasures – and will usually be bookended with stays in Prague and Berlin. Viking River Cruises (020 8780 7900; vikingrivercruises.co.uk) has a 10-day cruise on Viking Fontane or Viking Schumann, which calls at Dresden and includes overnight stays in Berlin and Prague with the option to extend (from £1,995pp, departing from March to November 2014). Three of Europe’s grand capitals, Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest, feature on a number of Danube cruises. Avalon Waterways (0808 115 2758; avaloncruises.co.uk) offers a Vienna-to-Budapest Taste of the Danube cruise on Avalon Affinity, combining a three-day cruise with a two-night stay in each of Vienna and Budapest. From £1,755pp for departures from May to September 2014. Paris is usually the launch point for cruises along the Seine (below) with time to enjoy the city before heading farther afield. Great Rail Journeys (01904 521982; greatrail.com) offers a selection of seven-day cruises on board the three-star converted barge, Anacoluthe. All sailings include an illuminated evening cruise through Paris, from £1,225pp, departing March to November 2014. Indulging in food and wine
Rhone cruises include Lyon, France’s capital of gastronomy, and the river’s route reads like a wine list. Great Rail Journeys (01904 521982; greatrail.com) has an eight-day cruise on Amadeus Symphony including visits to Macon and Beaune for a Beaujolais wine tasting, and also featuring Avignon, Arles and the Ardèche, from £1,950pp departing May to August 2014. A Douro cruise is a journey through Port wine country, and a chance to learn about and taste this celebrated beverage. Uniworld (0800 988 5867; titantravel.co.uk/uniworld) offers an eight-day round-trip cruise from Porto on the Queen Isabel, with Port tastings and a dinner at Quinta da Avessada, as well as an excursion to Salamanca, departing May to August 2014 and costing from £2,799pp. Garonne and Dordogne cruises take in the scenic Gironde estuary, the handsome city of Bordeaux and an ancient village, Saint-Emilion, which gives its name to a fine-wine appellation. Viking River Cruises (020 8780 7900; vikingrivercruises.co.uk) has an eight-day cruise on Viking Forseti, with Margaux and Sauternes wine tastings included, from £2,095pp for departures March to December 2014. Palaces and castles River cruisers are spoilt for choice, not least on the Volga, where a wealth of historical palaces lies in store on a Russian waterways cruise. St Petersburg is an obvious highlight. In season (May to October) Viking River Cruises (020 8780 7900; vikingrivercruises.co.uk) offers 13-day cruises on board Helgi, Rurik or Truvor, between St Petersburg and Moscow with a guided tour of the collection of the State Hermitage in the former Winter Palace, an excursion to Pushkin to visit Catherine Palace and an optional tour of the Peterhof Palace included in the cruise price, from £3,295pp. Many Danube cruises include visits to the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. An itinerary offered by Avalon Waterways (0808 115 2758; avaloncruises.co.uk) includes this plus, in Germany, the fairy-tale Neuschwanstein Castle – one of the most popular of all Europe’s palaces and castles – and the Versailles-inspired Linderhof Palace, both built for King Ludwig II of Bavaria. There is also a visit to Munich’s baroque Nymphenburg Palace, where Ludwig was born. The itinerary combines a five-night cruise on Avalon Artistry II with three nights in Munich, from £2,055pp for departures May to October 2014). Scenic Tours (0800 566 8777; scenictours.co.uk) includes a private concert at Vienna’s Palais Liechtenstein on its 15-day Amsterdam to Budapest (or in reverse) cruise, departing March to November 2014 and costing from £3,245pp. More than 60 castles line the Middle Rhine, many along this river’s most scenic stretch, the Rhine Gorge. Riviera Travel (0845 163 9728; rivieratravel.co.uk) offers an eight-day Rhine cruise on Lord Byron, departing May to July 2014, from £1,349 per person. Ancient civilisations
The story of the world’s longest river, the Nile, is told through the impressive monuments that line its banks – the Karnak Temple Complex, the monument to Queen Hatshepsut and the tomb of Tutankhamen. Saga (0800 506066; travel.saga.co.uk) offers a seven-night round-trip cruise from Luxor on Jaz Royale, departing March to June and September to October 2014, from £749pp. Discover Egypt (0207 407 2111; discoveregypt.co.uk) offers a seven-night round-trip from Luxor cruise, on Alexander the Great, departing June 9 and 16 2014, from £1,399pp. Largely off the map for British cruisers until recently, a cruise on the Irrawaddy, in Burma, reflects this Buddhist land’s unhurried pace, as do the centuries-old pagodas and shrines that gild its landscapes. AmaWaterways (0808 149 9256: amawaterways.co.uk) offers a 10-night cruise, on the AmaPura, plus two nights pre-cruise and one post-cruise in Yangon costing from £4,999pp for December 5, 2014 departure. A Yangtze cruise through the spectacular Three Gorges gives a perspective on China neither road nor air travel can rival; but top historic sites – the Great Wall, Terracotta Army and Forbidden City – aren’t on the river. To see them, choose an escorted cruise holiday. Shearings (0844 874 8060; shearings.com) offers a 13-day holiday with a four-night cruise on board President Prime and stays in Shanghai, Xian and Beijing from £2,979pp for April 7 and November 3, 2014 departures. Adventure Gift-wrapped in intimate and colonial-style vessels, Mekong cruises offer a window on time-honoured traditions and contrasting Far Eastern cultures. Most Mekong cruises sail northbound or southbound between Siem Reap in Cambodia and Ho Chi Minh City – accessed from the Mekong delta port of My Tho. It’s also possible to sail farther upstream, in Laos, between Chiang Rai and Pakse. Uniworld (0800 988 5867; titantravel.co.uk/uniworld) has a 17-day itinerary, including a seven-night cruise on River Orchid, three hotel nights in Siem Reap with two days exploring the Angkor Temple Complex and stays in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, departing March and July to September 2014 from £5,049pp. Egypt aside, the only luxury river cruise on the African continent is a safari cruise on the Chobe in southern Africa (below) , where wildlife sightings on the Zambezi Queen include elephants, lions and zebra. AmaWaterways (0808 149 9256: amawaterways.co.uk) offers an 11-night itinerary with a four-night cruise, three nights in Cape Town and two in Victoria Falls, departing March to November 2014 from £6,689pp. On the Amazon, where water lilies grow up to 6ft wide, sightings from the boat might include pink dolphins, with more in the way of bird and wildlife ashore. Aqua Expeditions (0808 189 0361; aquaexpeditions.com) offers seven-night cruises year-round along the Peruvian stretch on Aqua Amazon, featuring night-time wildlife safaris and a visit to the Manatee Rescue Centre from £2,022pp excluding flights. Titan (0800 988 5806; titantravel.co.uk) has a 13-night adventure on Amazon tributaries – the Coca and the Napo – on Manatee Amazon Explorer, including pre and post-cruise hotel nights in Quito, departing May, June and September to November 2014 from £2,895pp. New and unusual
Only recently opened to international navigation, the Tisza rises in Ukraine, flows across the Great Hungarian Plain and into the Danube near Novi Sad, in Serbia. The Hungarian Puszta, one of the largest stretches of meadow land in Europe, features on a nine-day round-trip cruise on the Tisza from Budapest, offered by CroisiEurope (020 8328 1281; croisieurope.travel). There’s also an excursion to the Tokaj wine region. The trip costs from £1,165pp cruise only, departing in May and June 2014. For another off-the-beaten-track route, cruise the Oder along the German-Polish border, to the Baltic. Noble Caledonia (020 7752 000; noble-caledonia.co.uk) offers a seven-night voyage from Berlin on the Johannes Brahms, sailing to Szczecin in Poland, then Germany’s historic Pomerania region, the islands of Usedom and Rugen, and Hanseatic Stralsund, departing in May and September 2014 from £1,795pp. Following the launch of cruises on the Mississippi in America’s Deep South on a renovated paddlewheel steamer, the American Queen Steamboat Company (001 888 749 5280; americanqueensteamboatcompany.com) has turned its attention to the stunning scenery of the Pacific Northwest. This new voyage on the Columbia and Snake rivers recreates the final stages of Lewis and Clark’s expedition to find a river route to the Pacific in the early 1800s. Expect abundant wildlife and the chance to sip some celebrated wines. Light Blue Travel (01223 568904; lightbluetravel.co.uk) will feature an eight-night cruise tracing the explorers’ route from Clarkston in Washington State to Portland, Oregon (or in reverse) on the paddlewheel steamer American Empress, costing from £3,495pp for departures from April to November 2014).
