Sketch: Ed Miliband's quest to woo women
Michael Deacon watches Labour leader Ed Miliband host a Q&A to find out what female voters think of the cuts.

Yesterday Ed Miliband met some women. For the Labour leader this must have been an exciting prospect, as he doesn’t look like the sort of man who finds it easy to meet women. Admittedly this year he did manage to get married, but as he invariably refers to Justine Thornton as his partner rather than as his wife, the possibility remains that he doesn’t realise she’s a woman.
Mr Miliband was at a swish but sterile-looking conference centre in East London to host a “Q&A with women”. The stated purpose was to find out how women feel about the cuts. The real purpose, presumably, was to capitalise on David Cameron’s poor standing with female voters and show them that Mr Miliband, by contrast, is the sort of man who will listen to their fears, support them in their dreams, unscrew the tight lids of their jam jars, remember to put their lavatory seat down again and so on.
Thankfully for Mr Miliband, it was obvious that the several dozen women present – many of them representatives of women’s groups, women’s charities, Rape Crisis Centres etc – were naturally sympathetic to Labour. One even prefaced a question to him by saying, “I know you’re trying to do politics differently…”
So generous were these women, in fact, that none of them asked him why in its 111-year history the Labour party has apparently never found a woman it considers good enough to lead it, unless you count the brief periods it has let Harriet Harman and Margaret Beckett stand in on a sort of supply-teacher basis while it decides which man to elect next.
In this friendly, supportive setting, Mr Miliband seemed unusually unflustered. While his audience laid bare their worries about childcare costs and female job losses, he nodded encouragement (“Very good point! Well done!”) and wore his most convincing I-feel-your-pain expression (“I think politics is far too macho”). There was none of the scarlet-cheeked squawking we see from him at Prime Minister’s Questions.

In fact, he gave a reasonable impression of a sensitive, courteous human being. Unfortunately, he didn’t give a reasonable impression of someone you’d want to run your country. As ever he emanated no air of authority. Perhaps it’s the marionette-style flailing of his arms. Perhaps it’s the narrowness of his shoulders (he makes Pitt the Younger look like a quarterback). Whatever it is, you don’t feel completely confident that if you asked him to feed your children’s goldfish for a week while you went on holiday, the house would still be standing on your return.
Still, these women liked him well enough. So much so that they seemed to forget he was a man at all. “The elephant in the room,” said one, “is that we’ve got a problem with men!” Cue applause. Mr Miliband smiled nervously, while shooting a glance sideways to reassure himself there was a clear path to the exit if things turned rough.Happily they didn’t, and after an hour and a half he thanked everyone for their time, adding apologetically that he had to rush off to do a webchat. Leaving, however, didn’t prove as easy as he’d thought. At the door he tried desperately to fight his way free of his clamouring brood. “I really do have to go,” he stammered, as they clucked happily around him. “The ladies of Mumsnet won’t be very forgiving if I’m late…”
Poor Mr Miliband. Out of the frying pan, into the oven.

Lord Rogers attacks Prince Charles for intervening in Chelsea Barracks wrangle Lord Rogers, the architect behind the abandoned Chelsea Barracks development in London, has accused the Prince of Wales of "an abuse of power" which led to it being shelved. Architect Lord Rogers objected to the appointment of the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment to help design an alternative scheme at Chelsea Barracks Photo: GETTY	By Murray Wardrop 6:50AM BST 16 Jun 2009
The Prince last week won his fight to halt a £1 billion development of contemporary flats financed by the Qatari royal family at the historic site.
Lord Rogers, 75, has now attacked the Prince, claiming that he"single-handedly destroyed the project" and acted in an "unconstitutional" way by influencing the decision for the withdrawal of plans for 548 flats in steel and glass towers.
The Prince called the design"unsympathetic and unsuitable'' and has proposed a more traditional design by one of his favourite architects, Quinlan Terry. Four hundred objectors also wrote to Westminster council.
Speaking about the decision in an interview with The Guardian newspaper, Lord Rogers said: "It knocked the stuffing out of me, and the design team even more. "We had hoped that Prince Charles had retreated from his position on modern architecture, but he single-handedly destroyed this project."

The Labour peer also called for a national inquiry into whether the Prince has a constitutional right to become involved in matters such as planning applications which have economic, political and social ramifications.
In particular, Lord Rogers said he objected to the appointment of the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment, a charity of which the Prince is president, to help design an alternative scheme at Chelsea Barracks. Lord Rogers added: "Bringing in the foundation, his own boys if you like, is unbelievably questionable. I absolutely don't think this is acceptable. It is directly self-serving and is unconstitutional."
The row over the Chelsea Barracks site began in April after it emerged that the Prince had written to Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, calling for the project to be scrapped.
Qatari Diar, which is the development arm of the Qatari royal family, had already spent £30 million in fees.
The project, which would have led to the creation of around 5,000 jobs, will now be delayed for at least 12 months. The Prince's intervention has infuriated the architectural profession, with a number of leading architects condemning him for using "his privileged position" to disrupt the planning process.
Only days before the withdrawal, planning officers on Westminster council submitted a report that praised the development by Lord Rogers.
Lord Rogers said: "The prince always goes round the back to wield his influence, using phone calls or in the case of the Chelsea barracks, a private letter.
"It is an abuse of power because he is not willing to debate. He has made his representations two and a half years late and anyone but him would have been shown the door. "We should examine the ethics of this situation. Someone who is unelected, will not debate but will use the power bestowed by his birthright must be questioned."
Prince Charles and Lord Rogers, famed for building Paris's ­Pompidou centre, and the Lloyds building in the City of London, have clashed in the past.
In 1987 Lord Rogers's plans to to rebuild Paternoster Square beside St Paul's Cathedral were dropped after the Prince intervened.
Referring to the proposals in a speech at Mansion House, the Prince said: "You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe. When it knocked down our buildings, it didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble."

Rite of Passage heads for Cheltenham Festival Rite of Passage, favourite for the Cheltenham Festival's Neptune Hurdle, cemented his place with a comfortable win over two and a half miles at Punchestown. Satisfied: Dermot Weld feels Rite Of Passage has done enough to warrant his place in the Neptune Hurdle at Cheltenham Photo: GETTY	By Marcus Armytage 7:30PM GMT 17 Feb 2010
Comments
Having only his second start over timber, Rite of Passage, third to Dunguib in last year's Festival Bumper, never came off the bridle when beating Healy's Bar by a length, but proved that two miles five furlongs should be no problem.
Trainer Dermot Weld was circumspect, saying: "It was a satisfactory performance, but that's as far as I would go. He will be better suited to a more galloping track. Part of the reason for running him here was to give him experience of undulations. It took him time, but he got used to them."
He added: "We'll run him in the Neptune. I have the highest regard for Dunguib and if he were to go for the Champion we might go for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle instead."
Not many jockeys are entitled to a free bus pass, but amateur Godfrey Maundrell, 61, is in the form of his life. He recently rode his first treble at a point-to-point meeting and on Wednesday he was successful at Leicester when Lisadell King, which he owns and trains, won the Dick Saunders Novice Hunter Chase.

20 Dec 2011
It’s the best and busiest time of year for television, which can leave you spoilt for choice – or squabbling over the remote. Our handy planner, however, will see you through the next few days in fine style… CHRISTMAS EVE Carols from King’s, BBC Two, 5.45pm
Ease yourself into festive mood with the glorious annual service from the Cambridge college – the ideal accompaniment to tree decoration, gift-wrapping or a celebratory tipple. Oddly, it doesn’t involve Carole King. The Many Faces Of Les Dawson, BBC Two, 9pm
The likes of John Cleese and Telegraph columnist Robert Webb pay tribute to the bulldog-faced comic genius, with archive clips of Dawson’s satirical piano-playing, inimitable bosom-hitching and deadpan gag delivery. Warning: contains mother-in-law jokes. Outnumbered, BBC One, 9.20pm
Dreading your family descending? Be thankful you’re not a member of the hapless Brockman clan. Relish this sitcom while you still can. The three lippy brats will soon become too old to be endearing and the series is likely to take its last bow. CHRISTMAS DAY The Queen, BBC One, 3pm
Replete with roast lunch, settle down to watch Her Majesty’s address at the end of an annus mirabilis for the Royal family. Darcey Bussell Dances Hollywood, BBC Two, 6.30pm
The retired ballerina (and occasional Strictly guest judge) turns her hand to razzamatazz routines, analysing and re-creating classic numbers by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Let her put on the Ritz while you put some cheese on a cracker. Doctor Who, BBC One, 7pm
“Whopremo” Steven Moffat’s suitably seasonal take on The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. It’s a witty, wintry wartime adventure with added spaceships and Lancaster bombers. As cockle-warming as mulled wine, merrily magical and a real family treat. Strictly Come Dancing, BBC One, 8pm
In case you’ve been suffering glitterball withdrawal symptoms, it’s back for a tinsel-toed special. The line-up includes Su Pollard of Hi-De-Hi fame and former boxer Barry McGuigan, but we’re tipping comedian Debra Stephenson or EastEnders villain Charlie Brooks. There’s also a song from Shakin’ Stevens, who everyone had forgotten existed. Downton Abbey, ITV1, 9pm
The house not only has a huge tree in the grand hall but new-fangled fairy lights. How fancy. This two-hour bumper bonanza represents a return to form for Julian Fellowes’s drama. Bates languishes in prison, the servants organise a séance, the family head out on a pheasant shoot and Maggie Smith spouts some cracking one-liners. You’ll be blubbing into your Baileys by the end. Absolutely Fabulous, BBC One, 10pm
You’ll no doubt be watching Downton but it’s well worth recording this uproarious comeback for Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley’s raucous sitcom. Boasts some biting celebrity satire and a cameo from The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl. Will she be wearing *that* jumper? BOXING DAY The Borrowers, BBC One, 7.30pm
A joyous new feature-length update of Mary Norton’s loveable classic about little people who live under the floorboards. It’s stylishly shot, while the superb cast includes Stephen Fry, Christopher Ecclestone and Victoria Wood. Jane Austen – The Unseen Portrait?, BBC Two, 9pm
It is a truth universally acknowledged that after two days of crowd-pleasing tut, a viewer in possession of an inquiring mind must be in want of a decent documentary. This one asks if Austen biographer Paula Byrne has found an authentic picture of the great author. Agatha Christie’s Poirot, ITV1, 9pm
David Suchet twirls his ‘tache thoughtfully in eerie mystery Clocks, set in Dover during the run-up to the war. The classy cast includes Geoffrey Palmer, Lesley Sharp, Frances Barber and the late, luminous Anna Massey. The Royal Bodyguard, BBC One, 9.30pm
In his first comedy role since Only Fools And Horses, David Jason stars as an ageing soldier mistakenly put in charge of Buckingham Palace security. Disaster-prone daftness ensues and David Walliams co-stars. TUESDAY 27 DECEMBER University Challenge, BBC Two, 6.30pm
The final of the festive spin-off tournament between notable alumni. It’s fun to see the ageing boffins realise how much they’ve forgotten, not to mention the student snaps over the closing credits, which illustrate how much they’ve changed – or haven’t. Great Expectations, BBC One, 9pm
The Dickens bicentenary celebrations have begun. Now so does the Beeb’s brilliant blockbuster three-parter. Ray Winstone makes a menacing Magwitch, while Gillian Anderson is hypnotic as Miss Havisham. What larks. Click here for Christmas film highlights

The pleasant sting in the tail of this summer's poor weather – fewer wasps
Fed up with the wet weather? Britain’s washout summer could have a silver lining, with experts predicting fewer wasps.

Experts believe that the recent weather has been dire for the nation’s wasps – and therefore good for picnickers.
The low temperatures, downpours and high winds of recent weeks have come at a crucial time in the pest’s life cycle, with the ongoing deluge meaning there have been fewer insects than normal on which wasps feed their broods.
The result will be that later in the summer, even if the weather improves, there are expected to be fewer wasps flying around.
Dr Luke Tilley, from the Royal Entomological Society, said: “It is fair to say that wasps will have suffered in this weather. At this time of year, if they don’t get nutrition – from other insects – it is harder for them to survive. And if those other insects aren’t showing their heads and taking flight, it is very difficult for predatory insects to forage. It will have a knock-on effect on the amount of brood they are able to produce and therefore the next generation.”
April was the wettest on record, while forecasters are predicting that this month will set a new record for June. But for those looking desperately for silver linings to the weather, another has been offered by the Royal Horticultural Society.

It is predicting gardeners will enjoy brilliant floral displays in their gardens later this month. Guy Barter, from the society, said while many may not have enjoyed the weather, it has provided near perfect conditions for garden plants, which usually enjoy their peak from late June to late July.
The brief warm, dry period in March was ideal for planting and sowing and although the weather has since turned colder, temperatures did not drop enough to cause damaging frosts.
Meanwhile, the long periods of rain – which has seen most hosepipe bans lifted – have guaranteed there will be enough water for the rest of the year as well as restricting the activity of many insect pests. Of the gardeners’ foes, only snails and slugs have thrived in the wet.
“Gardeners only need to get on top of their snails and slugs. Everything is more or less back on track. We’re in excellent condition now for the rest of the summer,” Mr Barter added.
However, for most wildlife, the weather has been nothing but bad news.
Like wasps, other insects are the most immediately affected, as they cannot fly in the wet, so quickly die off due to lack of food – with fewer butterflies and ladybirds likely to be around this summer. Bees are also suffering from late blooming of flowers, with some colonies facing starvation.
The current bad weather comes after a winter in which the British Beekeepers Association said 16 per cent of honey bee colonies had been lost, due to ongoing problems with viruses and infections, as well as unfavourably mild autumn and then warm periods in February and March.
The low insect numbers mean less food for birds, which have also seen their nests flooded or blown away. Paul Stancliffe, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said there had been some “horrific conditions” and predicted it could turn out to have been “one of the worst springs for a long time” for birds. Even ducks have suffered in the wet, he added.
“It is not perfect weather for ducks,” he said. “They will struggle to feed like other birds. Ducklings have to feed themselves. They are not fed by adults and they are going to struggle to feed. They feed on aquatic invertebrates and are not going to find that easy in very stormy conditions. They have the added risk of nesting near to water bodies. They can be washed out.”
Another consequence of the recent deluge is expected to be smaller apples later in the year. The prolonged wet and cold period has come at the start of the growing season, and growers are predicting the UK harvest will also be around three weeks late.
