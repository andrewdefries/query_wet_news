Alan Cochrane
Faslane is for Trident, not Nat rowing boats What would an SNP-governed independent Scotland want with arguably Britain's most sophisticated defence establishment, asks Alan Cochrane.

Comments
A sure sign that the SNP administration in Edinburgh – that body that Alex Salmond insists on calling a "government" – is being buffeted by the gales of changing political fortunes is emerging as the First Minister attempts to agree the wording of a cross-party appeal on the Strategic Defence Review as it relates to Scotland.
For a week now Mr Salmond has been trying to find a form of words to which all the parties at Holyrood can agree over protecting what's called the "defence footprint" north of the border from what are expected to be swingeing cuts. In particular everyone appears to be worried that the contracts for the two giant aircraft carriers being built, in part at least on the Clyde and at Rosyth, might be scrapped.
What is intriguing is that what seemed to this observer to be a five-minute job in getting all the party leaders round a table to attach their signatures to a joint submission has taken on all the aspects of top-level summitry.
It has ended with huge SNP angst at the way the protracted negotiations have been reported and what appears to be yet another stumble by the normally sure-footed First Minister.
"Salmond pleads to keep Trident base" was this newspaper's front page headline yesterday – a reference that, at the insistence of the Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrats, the joint submission now appears certain to contain a reference to maintaining the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde.
Now the Nat leaderships insists, as well it might given the sensitivity of rank and file SNP activists over the lack of consultation on this and other major policy issues, that they're not now backing the Trident ballistic missile system. But an ordinary person might well ask what, if they're not keeping Trident, would an SNP-governed independent Scotland want with Faslane?
Or on a more prosaic level, as a colleague asked one of Mr Salmond's sharpest acolytes: " What is the point of having the Barbie house, if Barbie and Ken can't live in it?"
Whatever the Holyrood parties come up with – and, frankly, with a Conservative/Lib Dem coalition government in London there's a limit to how hard-hitting a resolution the leaders of those parties in Scotland can sign up to – there is little doubt that the whole affair is helping expose the nonsense that is the Nat view of defence.
Their insistence that they'd keep Faslane in an independent Scotland tries to suggest that we're talking here about some form of primitive wooden jetty where a couple of unarmed rowing boats would tie up alongside, rather than the lavishly accoutred base, which currently employs – directly or indirectly – 11,000 people; that is the reality of the Royal Navy's facilities at Faslane, arguably Britain's most sophisticated defence establishment.
The jobs argument regarding the review is, without doubt, an important one but we have heard nothing from Mr Salmond – and nor are we likely to – about the strategic defence needs of the carriers or any of the other bits of "kit" either being built or which are currently based in Scotland.
Elsewhere at Holyrood yesterday there was embarrassment for both Labour and the SNP in separate committee hearings.
The former's attempt to portray its alcohol commission as some form of neutral body was exposed for the partisan, put-up job that it was. The health committee heard that not only did Labour pick the commission's members but also that there was no evidence that its preferred solution of a ban on selling alcohol at below a "floor price" of the cost of production, plus the cost of duty and VAT, would work.
In another committee room, MSPs heard more evidence which confirmed, to this observer at least, that last year's Gathering – an international reunion of Highland clans – had taken on many of the aspects of a "vanity" project for First Minister Alex Salmond.
The organisation behind the event left £726,000 in debts, including the non-repayment of an interest-free loan, agreed with Mr Salmond, of £180,000. Alan Cochrane

Redundant staff at compensation body awarded ten times that handed to victims
Staff at the Government's criminal injuries body are being handed voluntary redundancy packages tens times the size of the average compensation awarded to victims of violence.
By Tom Whitehead, Home Affairs Editor
7:00AM BST 30 Sep 2010
A total of £868,000 was paid in so-called early release schemes for 14 employees of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) last year – an average of £62,000 each. At the same, around 31,500 victims of violent crime shared compensation payments from the authority of £209 million – and average of just over £6,600 each. Critics said the pay-offs for staff would be better spent helping victims of crime. CICA is the Government funded body responsible for assessing and awarding compensation claims for victims of violent crime. But it has faced regular criticism over the level of payments often given to victims. Related Articles
Government to slash cash payouts for crime victims
29 May 2011
Last month it emerged a nurse who was robbed, tied up and left for dead in her own car boot had been offered only £3,000 in compensation – a similar amount to that awarded to convicted criminals who were forced to slop out their own cells. In July it was disclosed that seven victims of the 7/7 bombings in London are still awaiting deals on compensation payouts nearly five years after the terrorist attacks. Blair Gibbs, Head of Policy Exchange’s Crime & Justice Unit, said: “Crime victims often struggle to receive adequate compensation, and the criminal injuries scheme remains bureaucratic and very inefficient at awarding payments quickly. "Money spent on pay-offs for these managers could have gone towards helping victims of violent crime.” A CICA spokesman said: “We are working with the Ministry of Justice to deliver a better service for blameless victims of violent crime. “Last year we resolved more cases, more quickly while cutting our administration costs. Departmental early release schemes help us cut future costs by reducing the number of staff.” Law and Order

Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad full of quality, says Andy Webster as he refutes Craig Levein's claims
Among the many self-serving claims made by former Scotland manager Craig Levein in recent weeks is that he failed because the players he had at his disposal were simply not up to the job.

Midfield, he claimed, was the only area where he enjoyed an abundance of quality: the defence and strikers were, he implied, not fit for purpose. Of course, what he really meant was the fact that he had won only three qualifying matches out of 12 (against Liechtenstein twice and Lithuania, all by a single goal) was the fault of the aforementioned players and that no blame could be attached to him. It is, of course, an argument with far more holes in it than the rearguard he complained about having to work with and one which was unlikely to find favour with those players he left behind. Hearts centre-half Andy Webster diplomatically declined to make the case for the Scotland defence but was quite prepared to argue on behalf of the nation’s forwards. “I think the quality in the squad is exceptionally high,” he said. “Even with the changes the manager made [to face Estonia] he was bringing on boys who are playing in the Premier League every week.

“So if you have that sort of strength in depth it’s only going to help as a team. You can call on that if and when required. “There is a lot of quality throughout the squad. Look up front and Steven Fletcher has started the game with Shaun Maloney and Steven Naismith in behind. “We have Jamie Mackie there as well, boys who are playing in the Premier League week in and week out. “Kenny Miller also offers experience so it must be nice for the manager to be able to call upon these people if and when they are required.”
Webster won his 28th cap at Pittodrie but it became a landmark occasion for the 30-year-old when he was handed the captain’s armband by Scott Brown upon the Celtic midfielder’s substitution. “It was nice to get the armband,” he said. “Any time you captain your country it’s an honour. It was good to get that opportunity because not many people do. “Of course, it was different from actually leading your team out but it doesn’t really alter the way you approach your job. You still do the same stuff and conduct yourself in the same manner, but it’s a nice touch. “There is a lot of quality in this team , a lot of boys you would look at and you wouldn’t argue with them getting the armband. So, from that point of view, it could have been any one of us.”
Webster claimed that Gordon Strachan had been pleased by the efforts of the players, who gave him his first victory in a managerial debut, a feat he had previously failed to achieve with Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic or Middlesbrough. “In the first half we kept the ball reasonably well under difficult circumstances,” he said. “In the second half we changed it round a little and they put us under a bit more pressure but I thought we coped with that reasonably well. “It was nice to get off to a good start under a new manager. You come and join up with the squad and even the boys who have been injured have made the effort to do that. “It is important to get that collective team spirit together and it’s important to show the manager what you can do.”
Webster certainly believes that things can only get better under Strachan once the manager, who turns 56 on Saturday, has the opportunity to transmit his ides to the group in more detail. “The difficult thing with international management is the short period of time you have,” he said. “Obviously, what we have done leading up to the game let us work on one or two things. It planted the seeds for people to think about it. “When you get to this level, though, sometimes the players have to take responsibility. You go out there and have to make decisions: that’s what you are judged on as a footballer. “So I think the manager has implemented his ideas, which the boys have taken on board. Marry that with the quality we have and, hopefully, that will stand us in good stead.”

Reality TV and Facebook – the worst innovations of last decade
Reality television, Facebook, Twitter and congestion charging are some of the worst innovations of the last decade, according to a survey which has highlighted the most beneficial and most negative ideas to have changed our lives in recent years. By Harry Wallop, Consumer Affairs Editor

The internet dominates both the best and worst lists, with home broadband, followed by online shopping as the two ideas to have made the most positive contribution to our lives. Google, the search engine comes in at third place. A decade ago, just over a quarter of the population had the internet at home, with nearly all of it via a slow dial-up connection, making booking a holiday, viewing pictures, or buying an item of clothing a painfully slow business. Last year 73 per cent of the population had the internet at home, according to the Office for National Statistics with most of those people enjoying a broadband connection. However, the internet is also responsible for many ideas that people don't appreciate, including Twitter, the micro blogging site; Facebook, the social network; and Pop-up advertising, all of which make it into the top five innovations that have had the most negative effect on our lives. The shortlist of the innovations of the decade was drawn up the Foundation, a consultancy, which advises retailers, banks and other consumer companies. The list was then voted on by 2,200 consumers.

Charlie Dawson, a partner at The Foundation, pointed out that the majority of the population now pay for broadband – something that was not even available more than a decade ago. He said: “This survey is a reminder of how useful broadband has become for most people in the UK. It allows us to do lots of things more quickly, more effectively and with a lot less effort, from shopping to dating to finding stuff out." The roots of reality television stretch far back, but it took off in Britain in 2000 with Castaway, featuring Ben Fogle, now a presenter and Telegraph columnist, and others living on a remote Scottish Island for a year. It was swiftly followed by Big Brother and an increasing line of more down market and exploitative shows. The main reason the format topped the list, along with Facebook and Twitter, was "irritation" and "time wasting", according to the those surveyed. Technology is also behind the fourth most hated innovation: automated call centres, which force consumers – trying to ring up their utility company or bank – to listen to a machine telling them to push numbers on their telephone keypad. Green measures feature on both the worst and best list, with community recycling schemes, such as Freecycle, being warmly welcomed as a way of obtaining cheap products and ensuring cast-offs go to a good home. However, paying for plastic bags, an idea pioneered by Marks & Spencer made the most hated list. The idea was meant to save millions of bags ending up in landfill, but some shoppers now complain that they are left with a mountain of "bags for life" cluttering up their kitchens. The innovations of that have contributed the most to Britain in the last 10 years
