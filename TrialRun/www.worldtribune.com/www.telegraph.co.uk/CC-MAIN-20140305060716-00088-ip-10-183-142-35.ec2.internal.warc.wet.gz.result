BBC: Christmas strike over sacking of five staff
The BBC's Christmas schedule could be severely disrupted after journalists were balloted for a nationwide strike over the redundancy of just five members of staff at the BBC Asian Network.

The National Union of Journalists is urging all its members at the BBC to vote in favour of industrial action, which is being planned for "several days" over the Christmas holiday. The union said the action could be "very detrimental" to the Christmas schedule and urged the broadcaster to save employee's jobs. Michelle Stanistreet, the NUJ general secretary, said: "We are fighting for jobs and quality journalism. Recent events have proved that journalism needs to be properly resourced. That is why I have called for a moratorium on these cuts."
The Asian Network, a digital radio station, is having its budget cut by around a fifth and will lose around half of its staff. The BBC said it was "extremely disappointed" by the NUJ's move. "We have implemented all the redeployment commitments we agreed with the joint unions in a timetable agreed with them," a spokesman said.

Cameron, Miliband and Clegg hopeful of agreeing 'historic' newspaper regulation deal in next 48 hours
Talks about the future of press regulation were going on late into Monday night, with the three main parties hopeful of agreeing a deal in the next 48 hours.

Follow Ed Miliband was hoping to sit down with David Cameron and Nick Clegg later on Tuesday or Wednesday to agree a historic new deal which would see newspapers regulated like the BBC. The Labour leader was due to meet with the Prime Minister and deputy Prime Minister later on Tuesday morning or on Wednesday, after a day of intensive cross-party talks on Monday. The plan was to agree a new to agree terms for a new royal charter - similar to the way the BBC is kept in check - to underwrite press regulation. Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, and Culture secretary Maria Miller are leading the talks for the Tories, Lord Wallace of Tankerness for the Liberal Demcorats and Harriet Harman, the shadow Culture secretary, for Labour. Conservative sources insisted that the talks were “on course” for agreement on Tuesday, while a Lib Dem insider said: "We are hoping we can close in on the deal - that is why we are bringing the three party leaders together."
On Monday night Labour sources briefed that the party was hoping to agree a deal "within 48 hours". The source added: "Everything is in the detail. It’s like drafting a piece of law so devil is in the detail.”
Lord Justice Leveson recommended new laws to underpin a press regulator last year as part of his inquiry into press ethics, which was set up after the phone-hacking scandal. Mr Cameron and other senior Conservatives fear newspaper laws could lead to an erosion of the freedom of the press, while Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to see Lord Justice Leveson’s proposals backed in full. The Tories have suggested a Royal Charter - the same type of legal structure that governs the BBC - as a compromise but Labour has been holding out against the current proposals. Speaking last month, Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said the party was still looking at plans for a Royal Charter, which were put forward by the Conservatives as an alternative to new laws governing the press. Miss Harman signalled her party could support the idea if the Prime Minister agrees to make sure it contains all the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry. Politics

Brussels 'to force Google to change way it presents results'
Google will be forced to change the way it presents search results in Europe or face sanctions from Brussels for unfairly manipulating its position as the world’s biggest internet search engine.

The European Union’s competition chief, Joaquin Almunia, said it is his “conviction” that Google is unfairly promoting links to its own services above those of third party companies, and that he fears it is abusing its dominant position. Google has been locked in a long-running row over whether it has changed its search results to give preferential treatment to links to its own services, at the expense of those from competitors. Last week US regulators gave Google the all-clear, but Mr Almunia, who is heading up a Brussels’ investigation into the matter, made it clear that he will take the opposite stance. “We are still investigating, but my conviction is [Google is] diverting traffic,” he told the Financial Times. “They are monetising this kind of business, the strong position they have in the general search market...This is not only a dominant position, I think – I fear – there is an abuse of this dominant position.”

Mr Almunia stressed that he was more concerned with the way that Google presents its results, rather than the complex codes at their heart. This distinction has sparked speculation that Google could be forced to clearly mark links to its own services, where it is found to have manipulated the search results to push them up the search rankings. Google chairman Eric Schmidt met with Mr Almunia shortly before Christmas to discuss possible ways in which the search engine could resolve the issue. Mr Almunia gave Google a month to come up with detailed proposals about potential concessions. By contrast, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hailed Google as “one of America’s Great Companies,” when it cleared the search giant of any wrongdoing last week. Although Google was changing the complex codes it was doing to so to improve the quality of results rather than to eliminate the competition, the FTC ruled. Google’s rivals reacted angrily to the FTC judgment. Microsoft branded it “weak” and “unusual” and called on Brussels to take a firmer stance. A Google spokesman said: "We continue to cooperate with the European Union."

Britain's best lakes
We highlight 10 of Britain's most beautiful and atmospheric lakes. Buttermere, Cumbria
Perhaps the most picturesque of the Lakes, Buttermere sits at the head of the Cocker Valley and is surrounded by dramatic fells, including High Stile, Fleetwith Pike and Haystacks. Its small size makes it perfect to walk around, and Scale Force, the Lake District's highest waterfall, is close by. Boats can be hired at the neighbouring lake, Crummock Water. Where to stay
The Syke Farm campsite (01768 770222), on the edge of Buttermere village, makes the most of this tranquil setting. Read more
