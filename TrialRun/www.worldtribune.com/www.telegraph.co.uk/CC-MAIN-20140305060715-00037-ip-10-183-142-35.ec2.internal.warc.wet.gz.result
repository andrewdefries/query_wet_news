Never-before-seen photographs of celebrities captured in informal moments by the artist Andy Warhol are to be sold. The American pop artist used photography as a medium of art towards the end of his career and had a tendancy to snap people in spontaneous moments. Warhol's shot of John Lennon was taken in New York in 1979, a year before he was shot dead, and shows the boyfriend of fashion designer Halston poking his tongue out behind the Beatle.Picture: 1stdibs/BNPS

Minister admits child care tax breaks could hit stay-at-home mothers
A minister has admitted that plans to give parents child care tax breaks could hit stay-at-home mothers and may now be reconsidered.

The Coalition was forced to postpone an announcement giving every parent with children under five tax relief worth about £2,000 per child amid haggling between senior ministers over the detail and funding of the scheme.
The scheme was billed as the principal policy to emerge from the Coalition’s Mid-Term Review and followed the controversy over the decision to cut child benefit from those earning more than £50,000.
It is now expected that an announcement will not be made until the end of February at the earliest.
Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, earlier this month suggested that rather than being a universal scheme it would now be “targeted” at certain groups of earners.
However Lord Newby, the Treasury spokesman in the Lords, disclosed that there are concerns that there could be “problems” associated with a “tax relief-based scheme”. Related Articles

Disarray as child care tax break is put on hold
10 Jan 2013
The Lord Bishop of Chester asked Lord Newby whether it would be “unfair to introduce this tax relief for working parents with children while denying effective tax relief through transferable allowances to those parents who choose to stay at home with young children and who are currently penalised through the tax system for doing so”.
Lord Newby replied: “Obviously one of the problems with simply having a tax relief-based scheme is the one that the right reverend Prelate refers to. “That is why we are looking at a number of options, some of which are tax based and others of which are not. I hope very much, however, that the Government will be in a position to make an announcement on this very shortly.”
Liz Truss, the education minister, insisted this week that the Coalition was now agreed that it wants to help "all families who go into work".
Hours later, Claire Perry, Tory MP for Devizes and Mr Cameron's adviser on childhood, said the minister "got a little bit ahead of herself" in her tax break comments.
Mrs Perry said there are “furious negotiation” going on in Government about the proposed measures.
The new measure will replace the current complex £700million voucher and allowances scheme and could still be in force before the next general election.
Britain spends more on subsidising child care than most European countries but many families struggle to meet the costs when they go back to work.
The Government believes that about one million women are missing from the workforce, deterred by high fees for nurseries or childminders.

Comments
As the new woman in the life of Prince Harry, Cressida Bonas will have to keep him amused Doubtless, it will help that the 24-year-old performing arts student is an accomplished singer. Bonas brought Isabella “Bellie” Calthorpe to tears with her rendering of George Gershwin’s Our Love is Here to Stay at her half sister’s wedding to Sam Branson in South Africa. “I was really nervous before performing and wanted to direct my singing at Bellie,” Bonas says. “But when I saw her burst into tears and bury her head under the table, I suddenly had no one to sing to.” Branson says Harry wished he could have been there. “He really wanted to come,” he says.

The kinky hedge
It was the one occasion when Julia Bradbury appeared to over-step the mark with the Prince of Wales when he appeared on Countryfile over the weekend. The charming presenter was about to hammer a stake into the gound as the prince held it for her. “I must admit I am slightly worried about this,” she said, as she raised the giant hammer. “Never mind, I am used to it,” the prince reassured her. “I keep my hands away.”
“It’s not your hands I am worried about,” Bradbury responded, with a grin. Yesterday, Bradbury insisted she was referring to his head. Still, she did admit that the hedge they were creating became known as “the kinky hedge.”
“I hammered it in at a slight angle,” she explained “I am sure someone went along after me to correct it as the prince is a stickler about these things.”
We’ll meet again
President Obama may no longer have a bust of Sir Winston Churchill in the Oval Office, but some of the old wartime comradeship between Britain and America will hopefully be rekindled later this month. Mandrake hears that on March 27 the military chiefs of staff of Britain and America are holding their first combined chiefs of staff meeting since the end of the Second World War. It’s all a bit hush-hush. “We don’t normally comment on these things,” a Ministry of Defence spokesman tells me when I inquire. The Royal Family

Superstorm Sandy: US death toll passes 80 as New York gets back on its feet The human cost of Superstorm Sandy became clearer as the death toll in the US climbed past 80, with at least 37 killed in New York.

Two of the dead included two brothers, aged two and four, who were literally swept from their mother's arms by floodwater in Staten Island. Connor Moore and his younger brother Brandon were swept away as their mother Glenda tried to rescue them from her car on Monday. After a frantic search which started on Tuesday their bodies were discovered in marshland on Thursday. Staten Island has been the site of many tragic losses of life in New York. John Filipowicz, 51, and his 20-year-old son John were found dead in the basement of their home after it was flooded by the storm. Related Articles

Andrea Dresch, 13, was one of the first killed by Sandy in New York after a tidal surge engulfed her home. After three days of searching, her father George was also found dead. The US death toll is on top of the 69 already killed by Sandy in the Caribbean. As the recovery mission continued in New York, the city was also attempting to get back to normal. Subway services resumed for the first time, but only in Brooklyn, Midtown and Upper Manhattan. But the effect on the city's transport network was laid bare above ground. While power was slowly returning to lower Manhattan, huge areas were still without power and many subway stations were still flood-damaged. It meant that the only way into Manhattan from Brooklyn and Queens for many people was over the bridges. Thursday marked the first day of travel restrictions, introduced by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in a bid to ease the traffic disruption in Manhattan. Cars with fewer than three passengers were not allowed to cross the bridges into Manhattan, with the mayor urging people instead to take the bus, but despite the attempts to ease traffic many parts of New York City reported gridlock Thursday morning. At the Barclay's Centre in Brooklyn, huge queues – upwards of one mile long at times – snaked around the arena as people waited to get on shuttle buses into Manhattan. Television footage also showed traffic at a standstill on many of the main roadways into the city. Meanwhile ConEdison, the electricity company, said that while most homes and businesses in Manhattan should be restored by Saturday, many customers served by overhead cables in northern areas of New York would not have power for at least another 10 days. The city also announced it would start to distribute food and water to those without power in downtown Manhattan – dubbed the "black zone" for its lack of electricity. Around 4.7 million homes and businesses across 15 states still remain without power, down from nearly 8.5 million. Also at the centres would be mobile phone pods to help improve service, which has been patchy in some areas and non-existent in others since the storm. As the city attempts to get back to normal, Mr Bloomberg reiterated that the New York Marathon would go ahead as planned this Sunday, refuting suggestions that it would focus attention on still suffering areas of the city which runners will pass through. He also claimed it would not divert police resources. Officers are still involved in search and rescue and other activities in the wake of the storm. They will also be required to police Sunday's race. However one city politician called Mr Bloomberg's decision to stage the race while the clean up continued "idiotic". Staten Island Councilman James Oddo made the remark on his Facebook page and then told the New York Daily News: "The notion of diverting even one police officer, one first responder, one asset away from this carnage is beyond irrational. "The mayor said to me, 'We're not going to diminish what is happening on Staten Island.' You know what happens on marathons – you put a cop on every corner. How are we going to have enough resources?" USA

'Burying bad news' claim after ministers say who got £1.2million-worth of free London 2012 tickets
Ministers have been accused of trying to “bury bad news” during the Algerian hostage crisis by releasing the details of who received free Olympic tickets worth almost £1.2 million from the Government. Thousands of pounds was spent by the Government on free tickets for ministers to go to events including beach volleyball, rowing, athletics, basketball, handball and BMX Photo: Christopher Pledger for the Telegraph	By Christopher Hope, and Peter Dominiczak

A breakdown of the list showed that the British taxpayer directly paid for 8,841 tickets to allow scores of top civil servants, ministers, actors and business leaders to attend the Olympics and Paralympics last August and September. The overall amount spent - £1.17million – was far more than the £750,000 which had previously been forecast by sports minister Hugh Robertson in November 2011. It was spent on 8,841 tickets for the Olympics and Paralympics games. Analysis by The Daily Telegraph shows that thousands of pounds was spent by the Government on free tickets for scores of its ministers to go to events including beach volleyball, rowing, athletics, basketball, handball and the BMX cycling. However, the figures did not include scores of free tickets given to the Coalition’s most senior ministers including David Cameron and Nick Clegg and most of the Cabinet by Locog, the Games’ organiser. The statistics also do not include visits to the Games paid for by companies and sponors. Last night Labour MP John Mann compared the decision to release the information during the Algerian hostage crisis with an attempt by a former adviser to Labour Cabinet minister Stephen Byers to “bury bad news” during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He said: “People will be very cynical about the Government doing this now when everyone is rightly concentrating on what is happening in Algeria. It is yet another attempt by successive Governments to bury bad news – will someone reason like Stephen Byers’ assistant had to?”
Details of the spending, disclosed on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s website, show: - the Government paid for 7,646 Olympics and 995 Paralympic tickets. Of the Olympic allocation 3,137 tickets went to central Government, 2,020 to council officials, 116 to VisitBritain, and 2,373 to Olympic ‘ambassadors and individuals’. - £7,560 was spent on free tickets for 50 ministers including those for Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude and Universities minister David Willetts to watch the Beach Volley Ball, yards from Mr Maude’s Whitehall office; - the most treated politician was foreign office minister Alistair Burt who went to five free events, costing £605, including BMX Cycling, diving and artistic gymnastics; - Local Government secretary Eric Pickles and Bob Neill received tickets worth nearly £100 each to watch the athletics, while welfare minister Lord Freud was given a ticket worth £155 to watch the basketball, - David Cameron’s father in law Lord Astor, who was an Olympic ambassador, was given a £10 ticket to watch the rowing; - Jonathan Stephens, the Culture department’s permanent secretary, was the most treated mandarin, going to the BMX cycling (£55), show-jumping (£55), sailing (£55), swimming (£185), as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. The disclosures also show that Commons speaker John Bercow was given two tickets worth £145 to go to watch the tennis, while an official from the Home Office whose name was “redacted for security reasons” was given a £45 ticket to the tennis. Guests who were treated by the Government to the opening and closing ceremonies included Cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood and his wife Suzanne, Google chief Eric Schmidt, Sir Mervyn and Lady King, George and Frances Osborne, as well as Homeland star Damian Lewis and his actress wife Helen McCrory. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said that ministers had agreed to publish the information earlier this week.
“The London Olympic and Paralympic Games were a phenomenal success. To suggest that Government should be reproached for playing a part in that by hosting delegations and promoting British interest and business on this international platform is ridiculous. "It took a while to collate the required information and as with all written ministerial statements we notified Parliament earlier this week of our intention to publish.”

ZX Spectrum relaunch: the original gaming machine
The ZX Spectrum is to be releaunched to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Here we chart its history
The new ZX Spectrum could use a wireless keyboard and an iPhone 6:15PM GMT 04 Feb 2011
Comments
For a generation of Britons, the ZX Spectrum was the first home computer.
Released in 1982 as a replacement for the ZX81, the first edition of the computer cost £125 - or £175 for the top of the range 48kb model. Though puny by today’s standards, the Spectrum could handle a range of programs, including word processors, databases and, of course, games. Many of today’s 30-somethings got their first experience of gaming on the Spectrum, wowed by platform games like Boulder Dash and Manic Miner, shoot-em-ups like R-Type. Many of today’s games, though vastly superior in terms of graphics are simply variations on those seminal early titles. The ZX Spectrum’s distinctive rubber keys were mocked by sceptics, and despite fans’ affection they didn’t last. The ZX Spectrum+, released in 1984, used a more traditional keyboard. Eventually, Alan Sugar’s Amstrad bought the brand and released a range of 'Spectrum’ machines of their own. But none ever attained the affection in which the original ZX Spectrum is still held.
