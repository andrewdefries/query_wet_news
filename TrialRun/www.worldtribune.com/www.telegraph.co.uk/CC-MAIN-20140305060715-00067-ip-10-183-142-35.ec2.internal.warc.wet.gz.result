Britain’s remarkable economic resilience
For every job cut in the public sector, at least two have been created in the private one
Green shoots? The unemployment figures have been a source of surprise to many economic observers Photo: ALAMY	By Telegraph View

Comments
Yet again, the latest employment figures have confounded expectations of what should happen in an economic downturn. Despite a lengthy period of stagnant growth, including two periods officially identified as recession, there are more people in work today than at any time in our history. Between February and April, the workforce grew by 24,000 to 39.7 million and the numbers claiming jobless benefits fell for the seventh consecutive quarter. Partly, this reflects the failure of official GDP statistics to pick up on the creation of new micro-businesses and an expansion of self-employment, both facilitated by the internet. But it is also a function of a willingness of people in work to take a pay cut or no real-terms increase over the past few years. Where once the trade-off for year-on-year wage rises was higher unemployment, today people are prepared to forgo the former to reduce the latter. The consequence has been a period of declining living standards as inflation has kept ahead of pay, a point that Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, made in the Commons yesterday. However, his description of this phenomenon as a “crisis” demonstrates how his party hankers after the days when the unions would drive up wages at the expense of jobs. The resilience of the labour market has been replicated elsewhere in the economy. Manufacturing firms are hiring once more and average weekly earnings are growing, though this may reflect bonus payments delayed until after the higher rate income tax cut came into effect in April. David Cameron was right in the Commons to talk up this good news: persistent gloom from our politicians is an enemy of confidence, which investors and job creators desperately need. But he is also wise to be cautious: the premature sighting of economic green shoots has proven to be politically embarrassing in the past, and there are still worrying trends, including unresolved difficulties in the eurozone, an economic slowdown in China and the apparent fragility of the global stock-market boom. Quantitative easing has also made it hard to rebalance the economy away from a recovery fuelled by debt to one led by manufacturing and exports.
None the less, the signs are promising, and while we would have liked to see a more robust, pro-growth, tax-cutting approach from George Osborne, the Chancellor can at least rebut Labour’s charge that austerity is wrecking the country. For every job cut in the public sector, at least two have been created in the private. Given the historic scale of the contraction since 2008, the seeming resilience of the economy is nothing short of remarkable.

Prince Charles
Charles and Camilla in Papua New Guinea: sing-sings and nose rubs await Royals Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall begin a tour of Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand on Saturday with traditional sing-sings and Maori nose-rubbing welcomes awaiting them. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were recently entertained by a traditional Papua New Guinean drummer at a reception at St James's Palace Photo: AFP/Getty Images	10:17AM GMT 02 Nov 2012
Comments
The November 3-16 trip is the latest to the Commonwealth by senior royals to mark Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee, a landmark that saw millions of patriotic Britons attend various events during four days of festivities in June. Looking to build on a surge in enthusiasm for the royal family, Prince Charles will make a nostalgic return to impoverished Papua New Guinea. He first visited in 1966 while studying at Geelong Grammar School in Australia. Prince Charles has since twice revisited the Pacific nation. But it will be a first visit for the Duchess, who has reportedly been on a private holiday at a holistic health retreat in India ahead of their arrival. The Royal couple may have trouble landing, with disgruntled landowners vowing to disrupt their arrival in the capital. Related Articles

The locals claim they are still owed some 4.5 million kina (£1.4 million) in outstanding compensation for the land on which Port Moresby's airport is built and have threatened to blockade the terminal. "If it means shutting down the airport on the arrival of Prince Charles, then we can do it and face the consequences," their spokesman Kila Joe Gabutu said, although Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has played down the threat. "The royal visit gives us an opportunity to showcase Papua New Guinea to the rest of the world," he said. "It's a significant event which the people of Papua New Guinea are looking forward to."
During the PNG leg, the royals are also due to visit the village of Boera, where locals are restoring coastal mangroves. On the agenda will be traditional sing-sings, in which tribes or villages gather to show off their distinct culture, dance and music, dressing in elaborate costumes and war paint. Prince Charles has not visited Australia since 2005, although the Queen was Down Under last year when thousands turned out to greet her, and the Duchess will be making her first visit. They will tour the outback town of Longreach and the cities of Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Sydney and Canberra. Support for the royals in the former British colony remains strong, although debate flares periodically about whether ties to the monarchy should be cut and the nation become a republic. The Australian Republican Movement said Prince Charles and his wife were welcome but the country's link to the monarchy was outdated. "We welcome distinguished visitors from the UK, as we would welcome distinguished visitors from other countries with which we have close cultural links," said its national director David Morris. "But we should have the confidence to do so as a fully independent nation."
The royal couple wrap up their Southern Hemisphere trip in New Zealand, where Prince Charles will celebrate his 64th birthday on November 14. Their main functions are in Auckland and Wellington and will include a traditional Maori welcome that involves the hongi, or pressing of noses, and inspecting costumes from the forthcoming Peter Jackson film "The Hobbit".
