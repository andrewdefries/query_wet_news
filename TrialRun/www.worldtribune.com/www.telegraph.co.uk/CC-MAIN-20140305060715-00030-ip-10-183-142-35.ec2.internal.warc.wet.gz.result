China built its HS2 in two years. Don’t let Labour derail ours
Balls and Co thought it was a great idea. Until they spotted a chance to woo the sceptic vote

There were quite a few amazing things about the high-speed train I took the other day in China. It went faster than the fastest Maserati ever made, and it shot through fields dotted with stooping straw-hatted peasants and it zoomed past high mountains and sprouting new cities and it emitted no more noise or vibration than a purring cat – but that wasn’t the truly extraordinary thing about the route. It wasn’t the speed or the silence or the comfort or the supply of hot towels. It was the fact that our Chinese friends had built the whole darned thing since I had been there last, in 2006. They made the entire 813-mile track from Beijing to Shanghai, rifle-barrel straight, with umpteen gorgeous new marbled stations, with concourses so clean you could use them to gobble your dim sum – and how long did it take them? It took two years! Two years, amigos. That is how long we have already been gassing away about HS2, a period in which we have spent literally hundreds of millions of pounds on drawings and consultants and planning and what have you – and not laid so much as a rail. Two years! That is the kind of period we set aside, in our big infrastructure projects, for the first consultation on the environmental impact assessment. And then there will be the equalities impact assessments and the judicial reviews and the appeals and the planning inquiries and the whole spine-cracking yawnathon that will comfortably soak up a decade or more in which we fail to achieve what the Chinese have done in two years. If we are to have any hope of meeting the infrastructure needs of this country we need first to recognise the severity of the problem – that with a population set to grow to about 80 million by the middle of the century, we need to plan now for the most effective and environmentally sensitive way of housing this population, of providing them with sanitation and power, and above all of enabling them to move speedily between the great wealth-creating zones of this country.

Upgrading rail network better value than HS2, government finds
03 Nov 2013
One way or the other, we are going to need HS2, and it is a total disgrace that the Labour Party is now playing politics with the scheme. They are shamelessly courting the sceptic vote – feigning support but unofficially signalling that a Labour government would pull the plug. Ed Balls has said that the case has yet to be made out – even though he went into the last election with HS2 in his manifesto. Alistair Darling has said it is a “disaster”. Peter Mandelson now claims the whole thing was nothing but an electoral gimmick and should be junked. And you can see why Labour is so tempted, and why they have played this card. They have an economic credibility problem. They are going to have to persuade the electorate that they have some big and unexpected source of funding that will enable them to fulfil all their promises – to cut your fuel bills and plump your pension and subsidise the minimum wage – and the answer is always going to be HS2. They can also see that the Tories are facing a revolt from those on the route, and from those who aren’t convinced that the scheme represents a good use of public money. Their objective is to make the project politically toxic with a drip, drip, drip of cold water, in a kind of chemical reaction: HS2 + H2O = H2SO4. They hope that continuing anxieties about noise and property prices will cost the Tories votes in key marginals. They are fomenting general hostility to the scheme, and, in particular, they are supporting those who say that investment in HS2 means diverting crucial spending from other parts of the railway network – and there I believe they are talking more nonsense than ever. This was exactly the case that was made to me, more than five years ago, when the economic crash first happened and we were about to commit to spending £16 billion on Crossrail. It was mad, people said, to build a whole new railway under London when the rest of the Tube network was in urgent need of repair, when we were still using bakelite signalling on the District line and when funds were so desperately short. I remember a passionate denunciation of the scheme from one distinguished transport executive. “Why would you buy a shiny new car and park in front of the house, when the house is falling down?” he asked me. Well, I think he was wrong then, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he agreed that he looks even more wrong now. We have not only got on with delivering Crossrail – absolutely vital to increase capacity on the London rail network. We have upgraded the Tube as well. We have cut delays by 40 per cent over the last five years, to pick a period entirely at random, and we are going on with a programme of improvements – with new signalling and automation – that will cut delays by a further 30 per cent. It is now absolutely clear that this decision was right, because the population of London has risen by about half a million in the same period, and is likely to keep rising for the next couple of decades. Without these investments, our public transport system would have rapidly exploded with the strain. Britain has the potential to be the biggest economy in Europe, both in population and output, in our lifetimes; but we simply will not be able to cope, or to give business the platform it needs, if we fail to invest in infrastructure. We need a new supersewer under London, we need a new hub airport, and we need to increase our rail capacity. There was a time when people like Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair would have recognised this. It is deeply regrettable that the current Labour Party leadership should be so opportunistic and short-sighted as to pussyfoot around about HS2. They are putting short-term tactics before the long-term needs of Britain, and they will not succeed. In 2015 the choice is going to be clear: between fool’s gold, and a Conservative programme for investment and long-term growth. Boris Johnson

Muse, Emirates Stadium, review
A space station, a giant robot on wheels, pyrotechnics, trapeze artists... Muse's show at the Emirates Stadium was certainly one to remember, writes James Hall. 3

Last Monday night, petrified residents of Coventry saw flames licking high above the city’s vast Ricoh Stadium. They took to the internet to tell the world that their beloved football ground was on fire. The apparent inferno forced the stadium’s owners to rush out a statement. Don’t panic, they said, it’s not a fire, it’s just Muse rehearsing the pyrotechnics for their world tour. The 34-date trek opened at the Ricoh last Wednesday and landed in Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium on Saturday for a two-night run. The word "landed" is appropriate. The stage set resembles a colossal space station which is supplemented over the two hours-plus show by a robot on wheels, a ginormous floating light bulb, trapeze artists, and CGI images of David Cameron and Angela Merkel performing the running man dance. The terrifying Spitfire Liquid Flame system that so upset the good people of Coventry is one of the saner things on stage. It’s all bonkers and suits the Devon trio’s brand of bombastic space rock down to the ground. Stadium shows tend to be tame affairs these days, but not here. The site of 60,000 people leaping as one to the astonishing Knights of Cydonia or Time is Running Out must be the most exciting thing that has happened in the Emirates all season. And the audience is a refreshing mix of young and old: a brutal "circle pit" in front of the stage – imagine a whirlpool of people moshing in a vortex – is countered by families with young children singing for all they’re worth a little further back. Crystal-clear sound helps, as does the slick playing of a band six albums into their career, brilliantly underpinned by Chris Wolstenholme’s shuddering bass. Related Articles

Muse: 'We're kind of cyborgy'
04 Oct 2012
But while the show encompasses all the positives of a modern Big Rock Show, it also includes too many of the negatives. Some of the imagery is hilariously dated. At one point an actress dressed as a 1980s secretary (all big glasses and power suits) runs across the stage, drinks petrol from a giant pump and... dies. Meanwhile a "banker" runs through the crowd flinging money into the air. He also dies. Flickering share prices cover the stage. The band is clearly trying to make a point about how big business and complex financial derivatives almost bankrupted the world. However the anti-capitalist shtick is all a bit too much, particularly when a pint of beer costs £6.50 and comes in a Muse-branded cup. Punters can claim £2 back if they return the cup after the show. It is the kind of ingenious financial engineering that got us into this mess in the first place. Follow Telegraph Music on Twitter

Mercedes-Benz GLA review
The Mercedes-Benz GLA is another contender in the increasingly impressive class of small SUVs
4
The Mercedes-Benz GLA is based on the A-class hatchback By Andrew English
3:00PM GMT 25 Feb 2014
Comments
Two years before the arrival of this new GLA, Mercedes-Benz launched the latest A-class with the line “A for attack”. It’s a premium manufacturer’s conceit to think it can do anything better than a non-premium counterpart, but in Mercedes’s case it has made a pretty good fist of building a Focus-sized series of models. This latest version is the GLA SUV, the fourth A-class derivative after the A- and B-class and CLA, all using the same basic chassis and front-wheel drive greasy bits. They’ve been doing bonanza business for Mercedes. Unexpectedly so, admitted Zetsche at Detroit in January, when he said that in addition to A-class production in Germany and eastern Europe he was also looking at making the cars in Finland. Since last year, the UK has bought 18,000 A-class models, with 70 per cent of buyers new to the three-pointed star. The GLA soft-roader should be just as successful, especially since it sells into one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Mercedes calls the GLA’s design “sensual purity” – I laughed, too. It’s wedgy and pretty anodyne but, like the rest of the A-class family, slippery through the air, with a drag coefficient of 0.29. Aerodynamics manager Norbert Fecker explained how beneficial this can be. Related Articles

“If you were doing say 70mph,” he said, “and the engine was consuming fuel at the rate of 53.3mpg and then you increased the aerodynamic drag by 0.01, your consumption would increase to 44.84mpg and the equivalent weight increase in the car would be 175kg [385lb].” So now you know. Like a lot of compact SUVs, it’s hard to see the corners of the GLA from behind the wheel, so it’s just as well the reversing camera is standard. And it’s not just the body that’s low in this car (it’s 2.5in lower than a Nissan Qashqai, 1.7in lower than a BMW X1), but you sit low as well. Just 1.5in higher than in an A-class and subjectively not much higher than the general traffic. Which seems an odd decision, since whenever you see market feedback on the appeal of SUVs, the commanding (high) driving position is always cited, particularly by women. The cabin is spacious, airy and full of useful storage. All the seats are reasonably comfy and the sports items in the AMG version are very supportive (as they need to be). The cabin’s design echoes that of the A-class so the instrument binnacle, the porthole air vents on the facia, the central screen and clear sans serif graphics are the same. The door cards feel hollow and cheap, however, some of the press cars were bedecked with a spectacularly fake timber facia and in places there were mismatched trim panels. There’s a generous amount of space in the rear and the back of the seat can be tilted upright to increase the size of the boot to 481 litres, which is almost 40 per cent bigger than the standard A-class. The UK’s most popular version is likely to be the 220 CDI diesel with four-wheel drive and Merc’s seven-speed, semi-automatic, twin-clutch transmission. Actually the 200 CDI version of the same engine is more refined and quieter, but also pretty slow, especially if you chose the all-wheel-drive, automatic version. The extra power and torque of the 220 CDI gives welcome get up and go to this 1.55-ton car (134mph, 8.3sec, 57.6mpg and 129g/km of CO2) and the automatic changes up briskly and early, which mitigates high-rev harshness. In comparison, the 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol unit in the 250 is nicely refined (143mph, 7.1mpg, 42.8mpg and 154g/km), but its extra thirst means it won’t be as popular. The GLA 45 AMG is an extraordinary device. Its unfeasibly quick 355bhp four-cylinder, 2.0-litre has 355bhp and is boosted at more than 26psi, so much you fear the little engine will get the bends if you lift off the throttle sharply. It’s limited to 155mph, does 0-62mph in 4.8sec, delivers 37.6mpg and 175g/km. Quite what it is for is beyond us and, at a price north of £42,000, it’s competing against serious kit such as Porsche’s Macan and we’re not sure it’s good enough in that company. The standard A-class is far from being the finest riding vehicle in its class and on sports suspension it feels like a wheelie bin on a staircase. The GLA rides about 2in higher than a standard A-class and, as a result, has more wheel travel. The test cars were also shod with 235/50/R18 Yokohamas and had the standard “Comfort” suspension for the MacPherson strut front and multilink rear suspension. Consequently, they rode better, the suspension "breathed" better on undulations and didn’t crash into potholes. It’s far from perfect, but so much better than the A-class. Mercedes has improved the handling, too. Turn-in to bends is slightly slower and more deliberate and there’s more body roll, but there’s also a more faithful response to the steering. Understeer is there but it’s not excessive and the 4x4 system keeps the whole shebang roughly in the direction of travel even if you play the fool. The steering is inconsistent in the way it loads up, but it’s accurate and nicely weighted at shopping speeds. But is this really a sports utility vehicle? Most will be sold with four-wheel drive, there’s a standard hill-descent control and from later this year you can order an "Off-Road" pack including an off-road setting for the electronic stability control and suspension raised by just over an inch. We drove these vehicles on a small off-road course at the Spanish launch. Frankly you could have pushed a four-poster bed around it and even in "head for the boondocks" trim the GLA has about as much off-road ambition as a pair of bunny rabbit slippers. If the standard A-class had never happened and the GLA was introduced instead, no one would have batted an eyelid. The GLA is a fine driving machine, not horribly compromised, economical and not exorbitantly priced (for a Mercedes). Just don’t talk about SUVs, because it isn’t. THE FACTS Mercedes-Benz GLA 220 CDI 4Matic Tested: 2,143cc four-cyl turbodiesel, seven-speed semi-automatic, four-wheel drive Price/on sale: £30,030 as tested (range £25,850 to £31,030, AMG versions £42,000 to £45,000)/now Power/torque: 167bhp @ 3,400rpm/258lb ft @ 1,400rpm Top speed: 134mph Acceleration: 0-62mph in 8.3sec Fuel economy: 57.6mpg (EU Combined) CO2 emissions: 129g/km VED band: D (£0 first year, £105 thereafter) Verdict: Try to forget the SUV description and you are left with a fine-riding, economical and not unattractive five-door hatchback. Whether that’s enough to convince folk that there’s sufficient difference between this and an A-class remains to be seen Telegraph rating: Four out of five stars RIVALS Nissan Qashqai, from £17,595 Non-premium market leader, though you can spec up a Qashqai to near the entry-level price for the GLA. Much improved and larger cabin with a good ride and handling compromise. BMW X1, from £25,755 Not BMW’s finest hour, with an awkward looking body and choppy ride quality for this 3-series-based SUV. Cabin only just passes muster, although there’s a good range of drivelines. Range Rover Evoque, from £29,200 Land Rover’s baby has stolen hearts in this sector in spite of high prices and cramped rear seats. The cabin is classy, off-road ability is good and it goes well, but not brilliantly economical. Follow @TeleMotoring

Oscar Pistorius's fame could help him make bail in Reeva Steenkamp murder case
South African legal expert Llewelyn Gray Curlewis says it is possible Oscar Pistorius would be awarded bail on the basis of his celebrity status, which could count as an "exceptional circumstance".
8:03AM GMT 19 Feb 2013
Oscar Pistorius: latest The athlete is accused of murdering his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Thursday, Valentine's Day, at his gated community home in Pretoria. Llewelyn Gray Curlewis, Vice Chair of the Criminal Law Committee of the Law Society of South Africa, said would have to prove "exceptional circumstances" in order to be granted bail at a magistrates court hearing in Pretoria Mr Curlewis said that the fact Pistorius is celebrity may count as an "exceptional circumstance". "Everyone knows who he is, it's not as if he can hide or get a passport and run away overseas without anybody noticing him," Mr Curlewis said. Related Articles

Mr Curlewis also pointed out that Tuesday's bail hearing would only concentrate on "whether to grant bail or not." "It's not a question of guilt or innocence at this stage of the proceedings. That is only to be determined in a couple of months' time from now." Pistorius made history at the London Games last year when he became the first double-amputee track athlete to compete in the Olympics. Known as 'the Blade Runner' a nickname that plays off the hi-tech carbon-fibre blades that he races on, Pistorius remains in custody in a red-bricked, one-storey police station in Pretoria. Reeva, a blonde-haired model, law graduate and reality TV contestant, died last week of multiple gunshot wounds suffered inside Pistorius' upscale home. A 9mm pistol was recovered from the scene and Pistorius was arrested and charged with murder the same day. Prosecutors said in Pistorius' first court appearance on Friday that they would pursue a more serious pre-mediated murder charge against the Olympian and world's most high-profile disabled athlete. His family strongly denies he committed murder. The bail hearing will be the first time the prosecutors and defence will show their hands about the evidence involved in the killing. Pistorius' lawyers will likely try to show that he is not a flight risk and represents no danger to the community if he is free until trial. Prosecutors have said they will pursue a premeditated murder charge against Pistorius, which could make it more difficult for him to be granted bail. South Africa is one of a few countries in the world that that has a court system that takes root in Roman-Dutch law. Because of this, those appearing in criminal trials do not have the option of a jury trial, common in the US and other countries. Instead, a single judge will hear the entire case and then rule on a person's guilt or innocence. A premeditated murder charge carries a minimum sentence of life in prison. There is no death penalty in South Africa. Contains video from APTN

Patrick Devillers returns to China as witness in Bo Xilai case A French architect with ties to the family of Bo Xilai has flown to China to be a potential witness in the case against the politician and his wife.

Patrick Devillers, 52, was detained in Cambodia last month at China's request. Investigators believe that he was a close business associate of Mr Bo and his wife, Gu Kailai, and may be able to shed light on the couple's financial dealings. He may also be able to provide a possible motive for the killing of Neil Heywood, the 41-year-old British businessman and Old Harrovian who was found dead in Chongqing last November.

Mr Heywood was another foreign business associate of the family and Ms Gu has been accused of his murder. Mr Devillers was freed from a prison in Phnom Penh on Monday and boarded a flight for Shanghai on Tuesday 'by his own will', said Sok Phal, a deputy national police chief, to AFP. Related Articles

Cambodia had previously promised not to extradite Mr Devillers without evidence that he had committed a crime. "He said he is going there to be a witness," he added, saying that China had requested his release. "The French embassy supported this 100 per cent." China has allegedly guaranteed Mr Devillers will not be prosecuted himself while on Chinese soil in return for his cooperation. Mr Devillers arrived in Shanghai on the same day that Laurent Fabius, the French Foreign minister, met with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi in Beijing. It is not clear if the two men discussed his case, however. The architect, who had lived quietly in a modest villa in Phnom Penh for several years, met the Bos in Dalian in the 1990s, when he was hired by Mr Bo to design part of the city's street grid. After becoming close to the family, Mr Devillers set up a company with Ms Gu in the UK in 2000 named Adad, but it was dissolved shortly afterwards. Mr Devillers said the company was an architectural design firm that had never been operational. China

Michelin guide 'covered up criticism of top French suicide chef' The Michelin guide was on Wednesday accused of covering up its alleged role in the suicide of leading French chef Bernard Loiseau. Chef Bernard Loiseau Photo: PHOTOPQR/LE BIEN PUBLIC	By Henry Samuel, Paris
8:58PM GMT 23 Jan 2013
Previously unseen documents suggested Michelin had told him it had serious reservations about the quality of his restaurant months before he shot himself.
Ten years ago, Loiseau was France's most feted chef. The charismatic cook's beaming face smiled from billboards, TV shows and recipe books. His restaurant, Le Relais Bernard Loiseau in Saulieu, Burgundy was a favourite with the late president François Mitterrand. Robert de Niro would drop in by helicopter for his signature dish of frog's legs with garlic purée and parsley sauce.
But on February 24, 2003, the chef finished his lunchtime service, rolled up his apron and drove home. Telling his ten-year old son – one of three children – to go and play outside, he went upstairs, locked the bedroom door and shot himself in the head with a hunting rifle, a present from his wife.
The following day, France was in shock and, within hours, a media storm erupted over what pushed this leading gastronomic ambassador to end his life.

27 Sep 2012
His wife, Dominique, who took over the reins of the restaurant, described it as a "moment of madness" from a highly-strung "manic depressive" who was "capable of great moments of euphoria and periods of deep anxiety". He was also steeped in debt after floating his culinary empire on the stock exchange and over-investing.
Loiseau was known to be obsessed with losing a Michelin star, saying it would cost him a "40 per cent" of his business.
But Paul Bocuse, the elder statesmen of French gastronomy, instantly pointed the finger at Michelin's rival, Gaul&Millault, which had docked the chef two points to 17 out of 20 in its 2003 edition. "Bravo Gault&Millault, you won: your appraisal has cost the life of a man," he exclaimed.
Next up for public condemnation was François Simon, Le Figaro magazine's waspish and influential food critic, who had published an article shortly before Loiseau's death citing Michelin sources as warning that the third star of his flagship restaurant was "legitimately under threat".
This led another top chef, Jacques Pourcel, to designate Mr Simon as the "prime culprit" in pushing Loiseau to commit suicide.
Michelin denied ever threatening to pull a star, which Loiseau's restaurant ended up keeping.
But on Wednesday, L'Express magazine published a confidential note penned by the legendary red guide's then British head, Derek Brown, that suggests otherwise.
Although Mr Brown this week insisted he never had "any real problem" with Loiseau's cooking bar "a few details, like the temperature of his soup", minutes from his November 2002 meeting with the couple at his head office recount how he gave them a serious dressing down.
"I spoke of our concerns: irregularity, lack of soul, of recent character in the cuisine and readers' mail that is VERY mixed in terms of quality," he wrote.
"Visibly 'shocked', (Loiseau) took me seriously," Mr Brown concluded. "We'll see."
Two days later, his wife sent a deeply apologetic response, promising to get their cuisine "back on track". But Mr Loiseau apparently never recovered.
On Wednesday, Mr Simon said he felt vindicated after all these years as he had merely reported on this stark warning, which he had obtained from impeccable sources.
"Michelin did indeed envisage docking Bernard Loiseau a star. They wanted to pass me off as a killer, while Michelin exempted themselves of any responsibility," he said.
"I was thrown to the dogs, treated as a murderer and still am by some. They needed a scapegoat," he told The Daily Telegraph. Derek Brown, Michelin director at the time, said: "There was no threat made to Bernard Loiseau of losing a star at any time. Michelin doesn't threaten anybody."
"He asked to see me. People who want to come and talk about their restaurant are very welcome," he told the Daily Telegraph.
"The idea of telling him about the concerns we had about some of his cooking was in order to give him an opportunity to consider whether he wanted to do something about it, which he did, as it turned out."
Michael Ellis, current director of Michelin told l'Express: "These types of meetings are part of daily life at Michelin. I'm not surprised such a meeting took place." But he added: "We don't summon chefs. We only receive ones who wish to see us." France
