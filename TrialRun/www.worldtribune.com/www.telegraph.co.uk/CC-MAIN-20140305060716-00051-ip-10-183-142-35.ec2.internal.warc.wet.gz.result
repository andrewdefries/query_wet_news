The Events: 'What do we do about evil?'
A new play at this year's Edinburgh Fringe was inspired by the atrocities committed by Anders Breivik in Norway. Tom Wicker meets its writer David Greig and director Ramin Gray. By Tom Wicker
11:31AM BST 02 Aug 2013
Comments
“If people had suggested he should be poked with sharp knives, 24 hours a day for the rest of his natural life, a bit of me would be thinking, yeah, that would be good,” says Scottish playwright David Greig about Moors murderer Ian Brady, recently in the news for his failed bid to be transferred from a psychiatric hospital back to prison. Greig is talking about Brady in the context of his latest play, The Events, which couldn’t be more different from the current West End musical extravaganza Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, for which he wrote the libretto. Exploring the idea of evil and the limits of forgiveness after an atrocity, The Events centres on a young church choir leader trying to make sense of a politically motivated mass murder that has torn her Scottish community apart. It debuts at the Traverse Theatre at this year’s Edinburgh Fringe. I meet Greig and the play’s director, Ramin Gray – whose Actors Touring Company is co-producing it – in London shortly after the dust from Charlie has settled and a deadline is looming. The Events has long been in gestation, but Greig only really began writing it a few months ago. Gray has directed two of Greig’s previous plays, but this time he’s been there from the start of the writing process. “I find it very bracing,” he says. “It’s always been a robust conversation that strengthens and challenges our respective viewpoints. And we’re still friends.” He laughs. These “fruitful discussions” have helped shape The Events since its birth in a post-show conversation between the two men in the Traverse bar at the 2011 Fringe. Anders Breivik had just slaughtered a total of 77 people on the Norwegian island of Utøya and in the capital, Oslo, in protest against multiculturalism. As the two men discussed this, Greig found he was at odds with himself. A “classic liberal” for whom “it’s hard to say a person is evil and beyond understanding”, his gut reaction was nevertheless to want Breivik imprisoned – if not killed – and never spoken of again.

“It’s quite a challenging moment, realising that your empathy has a limit,” Greig says. As a dramatist, the discovery of “this voice you’re trying to suppress, the violence of retribution”, demanded to be explored on stage. “ ‘Evil’ is a word that we associate with religious morality in a very pure and simple, black-and-white way,” Gray adds, adding that, thanks to science and psychology, “it begins to evaporate as you approach it. So,” he continues, “it’s very confusing when you have, as David says, impulses surging up towards someone like Breivik or Brady of ‘just kill him’. How you quiver in front of that position is very interesting.”
Through working on The Events, the two men also hoped to find an explanation for how atrocities such as the Utøya massacre occur at all. “When we were having that discussion in the bar, we were also talking about Islamic terrorism, political violence and the young men who perpetrate it, and whether there were connections there,” Greig says. “I’ve just done a musical [Glasgow Girls] about asylum seekers, and my orthodoxy is that diversity is good, mixing is good. But the question of its value when set against the disturbing backdrop of religiously or racially-motivated murders was “another perspective”. As research for the play, the pair interviewed experts in anthropology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology as well as several priests and an Utøya survivor – anyone with an insight into how people cope in the aftermath of a traumatic event – while still asking: why? “I really did think that if we pushed dramatically hard enough we’d find an answer,” says Greig. “Something like, ‘Now we can see that Islamic terrorism is linked to right-wing extremism because it’s all about fear of The Other.’ ”
But then came the Boston Marathon bombing and the Woolwich killing. And as “all the same whys” appeared, about radicalisation and the West’s involvement in foreign wars, Greig began to feel that “this human urge to understand” was endless and insatiable. It could never make the loss right. So, says Grieg, “you have to find a way to go beyond understanding. You have to go, ‘I need something else. I need acceptance, or something.’ ” Then, he explains, “it’s about communities, people, religion – about transcendent things, which drama is very good at.”
For Gray, the very question of whether it is possible to distil a single explanation is “one of the things that The Events wrestles with, as we all do”. ATC is co-producing the play with Young Vic Theatre, Brageteatret in Norway and the Schauspielhaus Wien in Austria. After Edinburgh it will tour the UK and internationally. In each place a different local community choir will perform during the show – a reminder, says Gray, that “these events can happen anywhere. That’s important.”
Greig is glad The Events is starting on “home turf” at the Traverse, where much of his work has debuted and “audiences trust you’re not a w­­-----”. This play is “a deep thing” for him. “It’s an attempt to understand what we do about evil. Do we try to accept it? Do we live with it?”
So how does he feel about opening night? “It reaches a point for me where there are two risks: that I’ve got the story wrong or people think it’s boring.” He smiles faintly. ‘Three stars – Metro – “interesting” ’ is always my terror.”
‘The Events’ is at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh (0131 228 1404; traverse.co.uk), from July 31-Aug 25, then touring nationwide from September. Details: atctheatre.com Follow @TeleTheatre

TODAY'S RADIO HIGHLIGHTS
TV GUIDE UK: SEARCHABLE TV LISTINGS THURSDAY 6 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: 37 Days BBC Two, 9.00pm
Two of the BBC’s best offerings last week saw historians Sir Max Hastings and Niall Ferguson present opposing views of whether the First World War was necessary. This absorbing three-part drama asks the same questions in a rather more theatrical format by exploring the complex power plays and political squabbles that occurred behind the scenes in London, Berlin and Vienna in the weeks that elapsed between the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June, and Britain’s declaration of war on 4 August, 1914. Writer Mark Hayhurst, a specialist in historical/political dramas, does a good job of breathing life into such stiff and remote figures as Liberal prime minister Herbert Asquith (Tim Pigott-Smith), his much-maligned foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey (Ian McDiarmid), ambitious chancellor David Lloyd George (Mark Lewis Jones) and a bellicose Winston Churchill (Nicholas Asbury) – with Sinéad Cusack a rare female presence as Asquith’s socialite wife, Margot. Hayhurst also excels in highlighting the sometimes pivotal role played by chance and misunderstanding in determining the course of global events. Some viewers may find it less than credible that up against such a sober array of British worthies, most of the foreign players tend to the more flamboyant end of the character spectrum. But it gives the production an unexpectedly comical lift, and counterbalances all that gloom in the face of coming war. Continues tomorrow. GOD

FRIDAY 7 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: Paralympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony Channel 4, 3.30pm The sporting action in Sochi is by no means over yet. After a Winter Olympics which saw home nation Russia top the medal table, while Team GB exceeded targets and equalled our best ever performance – in the process making a new national hero out of Lizzy Yarnold – it’s now time for 10 days of Paralympic competition to begin. Building on its Bafta-winning coverage of the London 2012 Paralympics, Channel 4’s broadcasts will total a record 150 hours – 45 hours on terrestrial and a further 100 shared across More4 and online – so there’s no need to miss a thing. Team GB is sending a team of 15 athletes to this 11th Games, which also see the debut of para-snowboarding. First up, though, Channel 4 News duo Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy present from Fisht Olympic Stadium, as 600 athletes from 44 countries assemble for the lighting of the cauldron. The ceremony promises to include pyrotechnics, ballet, acrobatics and “wheelchair contemporary dance inspired by traditional Russian choreography”. The mind boggles. Meanwhile, Jonathan Edwards, Ade Adepitan, Iwan Thomas and a raft of Paralympic experts are on hand to assess Team GB’s prospects. We were hugely successful at London 2012, winning 34 golds, with the likes of Ellie Simmonds, Sarah Storey and David “Weirwolf” Weir to the fore. Hopes here are high for our alpine skiers and wheelchair curlers. Can our Paralympians exceed expectations again? MH

Fonteyn ’59 Sleeping Beauty
BBC Four, 8.00pm
Last seen in1959 is a rare film of Dame Margot Fonteyn dancing in Tchaikovsky’s Sleeping Beauty, a segment of which was believed to have been lost until recently. Darcey Bussell introduces an edited hour-long version of the ballet. The footage which went missing was Act Two, which included the iconic scene when Sleeping Beauty is awakened by a kiss from the Prince. SH
Storyville: Muscle Shoals – The Greatest Recording Studio in the World
BBC Four, 9.00pm
The unlikely musical significance of Muscle Shoals, a backwater town on the Tennessee river in Alabama, is told in this beautifully filmed documentary about a recording studio and its links with Aretha Franklin, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. However the real star of this anecdotal film is Rick Hall, a musician, producer and the man behind the “Muscle Shoals sound”, which initially, and at a time of segregation, brought together black singers with white musicians to produce a highly distinctive blend of soul and earthy R’n’B. Interviews with Hall (memorably described as an “imperfect perfectionist”), his first backing band (The Swampers) and heavyweight contributors such as Mick Jagger and Percy Sledge add much to a story of success, rejection and a rare musical legacy. SH
SATURDAY 8 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: Paralympic Winter Games
Channel 4, from 5.45am
The sight of hundreds of disabled people performing Ian Dury’s Spasticus Autisticus at the 2012 Paralympics was a brilliant moment when both prejudice and liberal hand-wringing about disability evaporated. Channel 4’s coverage was superb and it’s good news that the network is airing the Sochi Games, too. These 11th Winter Paralympics will see 700 athletes from 45 nations tackling 72 medal events, including snowboard cross, which makes its debut as a Paralympic sport. Today’s first day of competition sees 12 gold medals up for grabs, and early bird presenters Arthur Williams and Kelly Cates will cover the action from 5.45am, after which Jonathan Edwards and Ade Adepitan will take over for the rest of the day and evening highlights show. The contest gets off to a thrilling start for Britain with the women’s downhill event for visually impaired skiers, in which we have strong medal hopes in Kelly Gallagher and Jade Etherington, who just won gold in January’s world cup. Sit-skier Anna Turney hopes to improve on her sixth place finish in the Vancouver Games, and Britain’s wheelchair curling team begins its campaign against reigning champions Canada. There’s also coverage of men’s and women’s biathlon and ice sledge hockey. The packed schedule will not only provide the usual high-octane thrills, but also move us a step closer to making sport for people with disabilities as important a TV event as its able-bodied predecessor. VP
The Voice UK
BBC One, 7.00pm
The singing contest that vies with The Great British Bake Off for the title of Britain’s politest TV competition continues to force its kindly quartet of judges to whittle their teams down ruthlessly. In tonight’s second and final battle round, two singers from each team perform the same song, after which their coach must eject one. Rachael O’Connor, who wowed judges with her cover of Emeli Sandé’s Clown is still favourite to win. VP
Discovering: Fleetwood Mac
Sky Arts 1, 8.30pm
Discussing the soap opera that is Fleetwood Mac’s 46-year history is a big ask for a show of only 30 minutes, but critics Camilla Pia, Will Hodgkinson and John Aizlewood tackle the incredible story tonight. They focus on how the group’s turmoil-filled personal lives were exposed in Rumours, their 1977 meisterwerk. VP
Salamander
BBC Four, 9.00pm and 9.45pm
The subtitled Belgian political thriller takes it up a notch tonight when Detective Gerardi’s only ally, the Attorney General, becomes the fall guy for the national crisis sparked by Salamander’s exposure. Though this lacks the flair of the Scandinavian sagas that usually occupy this time slot, there are intriguing moments, particularly when the series scrolls back to include Belgium’s wartime past. VP
True Detective Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm
The third episode of this cop drama focuses largely on the past, when cop Marty Hart’s (Woody Harrelson) personal life implodes and his good ol’ boy demeanour betrays an underbelly darker than the murky depths of a Louisiana bayou. Well acted by Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, this is as much a murder mystery as it is an exploration of the dark recesses of the mind. VP
37 Days
BBC Two, 9.15pm
In tonight’s final episode of this engaging political thriller about the tense days preceding the First World War, the Cabinet is split over Britain’s moral commitment to defend France, leading to arguments and resignations in the corridors of power. Though the drama is largely static, it fleshes out our knowledge of how Europe’s leaders were drawn inexorably toward the ensuing slaughter. VP
The Jonathan Ross Show
ITV, 9.20pm With Richard Branson pledging to launch himself and his family into orbit this year via his fledgling space travel venture, he has a lot of material for tonight’s natter with Jonathan Ross – a rare chat show appearance for the Virgin boss. Joining Branson on the sofa for Ross’s final outing of this run are US actress and singer Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) and ubiquitous comic Sue Perkins, plus there’s music from Mancunian rockers Elbow. VP
Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle
BBC Two, 10.15pm
Racist cab drivers and UKIP are easy fodder for comedians to take pot shots at, but Stewart Lee eviscerates both with a refreshing originality in tonight’s second instalment of his stand-up show. More uncomfortable are the segments with Chris Morris that punctuate the stand-up, in which Lee takes himself to task for being a poor specimen of a comedian. It’s a strange mash-up, but never less than thoroughly entertaining and often very clever. VP
SUNDAY 9 MARCH CRITIC'S CHOICE: Call the Midwife
BBC One, 8.00PM
“Nurse Lee has some news for us,” declares Sister Julienne (Jenny Agutter) in tonight’s third series finale. Could this mean that Jenny (Jessica Raine) is leaving for good after the mid-season hiatus prompted by the death of her partner, Alec? There are a few clues, if you care to look for them. Raine’s involvement in Sky Atlantic’s forthcoming Icelandic thriller Fortitude is likely to be more prolonged than it was in Line of Duty. More significantly, tonight also sees Jenny exchanging a few glances with a man called Philip. The real Jennifer Lee, it’s worth noting, married one Philip Worth. But second-guessing Call the Midwife is a dangerous game. Miranda Hart hardly wants for work but has always returned – and tonight really tests her skills as a serious actress as the condition of Chummy’s mother’s worsens. And if the third series started sluggishly, this creative stasis was never reflected in ratings which established it as Sunday’s most popular show. Alec’s demise also suggested that the necessary abandonment of Jennifer Worth’s source books need not be detrimental, allowing the formula to be tweaked and, if anything, for even bleaker material to be smuggled into the pre-watershed schedules – not least, last week’s depiction of electroconvulsive therapy. But with or without Nurse Lee, Call the Midwife can’t hold the Sixties at bay for ever; perhaps the most upsetting sequences of all are still to come as this warm-hearted but chaste series starts to swing. GT
Paralympic Winter Games
Channel 4, from 6.00am
Jonathan Edwards and Ade Adepitan present coverage of day two of the Paralympic Winter Games, when Great Britain take on Korea in the Men’s wheelchair curling. Highlights of all the day’s events get under way at 6.30pm. RH
Dancing on Ice
ITV, 7.00pm
Tonight’s grand final is the last ever episode of Dancing on Ice and it promises to be a spectacular conclusion for this surprisingly popular show. Former soap actors Ray Quinn, Hayley Tamaddon and Olympic gymast Beth Tweddle will battle to win, but more enticing is the fact that Torvill and Dean will perform the Boléro, 30 years after their gold-medal winning performance at the 1984 Winter Olympics.

Top Gear: Burma Special BBC Two, 8.00pm
In the first instalment of this two-part special, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May set off across Burma in three lorries bought sight unseen from the internet. Heading north towards Thailand, the trio must build a bridge over the River Kwai (geddit?). Worth watching, if only for the footage of this staggeringly beautiful landscape. RH
The Wigan Casino
Sky Arts 1, 8.30pm
Tony Palmer’s 1977 film celebrates the Lancashire dance hall that became the home of Northern Soul in the Seventies. With stories from dancers, DJs and soul singers such as Edwin Starr, the documentary finds a contrast between the all-night weekenders in the casino – and the invention of the dancers – and Wigan’s then-drab and economically deprived surroundings. A legal loophole allowed the club to thrive for eight years but in 1981 it closed; Palmer’s film is a reminder of those joyous times. SH
Fast and Fearless: Britain’s Banger Racers
BBC Two, 9.00pm; Wales, 10.25pm
This two-part documentary offers an alternative perspective on the much-derided world of banger racing. Admittedly, there are a few suitably shady characters on display to verify the stereotypes but what shines through is a universal love of, and respect for, the motor car. In tonight’s opening episode, we meet brothers Paul and Ricky as they prepare their Pontiac for the legendary “Firecracker” race, in which any size and model of vehicle is welcome. RH
Good Swan, Bad Swan: Dancing Swan Lake
BBC Four, 9.00pm
“It is the one ballet we all imagine doing,” says Tamara Rojo of Swan Lake in this documentary about the history of Tchaikovsky’s “indestructible” work, first performed in 1895. The ballerina and artistic director of the English National Ballet explains how when she first danced the role she watched swans to try and incorporate their moves into her dancing. She also tells of the challenging demands of Odette/Odile, the “innocent and pure” white swan and the “manipulative and erotic” black swan. The captivating Rojo also explores why Tchaikovsky’s score was so innovative and why the ballet is deeply ingrained in Russian culture. SH
MONDAY 10 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: The Michael McIntyre Chat Show BBC One, 10.35pm; NI, 11.35pm
The most popular comedian on British TV graced many a chat show sofa during the course of his phenomenal career. Now he’s trying his hand at being the host (for a reported fee of £500,000 for six 45-minute shows). In terms of USP, the most original thing about the show appears to be its Monday night scheduling, although McIntyre’s team insist his show will be less plug-centric than most, the aim being to get audiences laughing rather than yawning at stars droning on about their latest films or memoirs. While we know that’s not really how the chat show circuit works, McIntyre probably does have the celebrity clout to get people on just for the fun of it – especially as his style is almost certain to be less abrasive and intrusive than many of his fellow comedians turned chat show hosts. Of his debut trio of guests, neither Sir Terry Wogan nor Lord Sugar have new books, films or shows coming out, as far as we are aware, although Lily Allen does have an album coming out soon. The show hadn’t even been recorded as we went to press, so it’s anybody’s guess as to how successful it will be. However, McIntyre’s infectiously funny personality makes the likelihood of its success very high. Rumour has it that a recent trial run was exceedingly good fun, with McIntyre making especially good use of his renowned audience-handling skills to get everyone rolling in the aisles. Let’s hope it lives up to that promise. GOD

Silk
BBC One, 9.00pm
Part of this legal drama’s appeal is the chemistry between its two leads, Rupert Penry-Jones and Maxine Peake. When they’re on screen together, you can almost forgive its copious inaccuracies about the legal profession. In tonight’s episode, the sexual tension between Martha (Peake) and Clive (Penry-Jones) is ratcheted up a notch, as they find themselves on opposing sides in a high-profile case of assisted suicide. PS
Mind the Gap: London vs the Rest

Grand Canal Journeys

TUESDAY 11 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: Shetland
BBC One, 9.00pm
There’s a fine tradition of Scottish TV sleuths, from Taggart to Rebus, via Hamish Macbeth, Messiah’s Red Metcalfe and Mike Walker from Trial & Retribution. As a genre, Caledonian crime-crackers tend to be dour, dogged, partial to a dram of whisky and prone to pronouncing the word “murder” in distinctive ways. The latest in this fine line is DI Jimmy Perez, star of the Shetland Island novels by Ann Cleeves. After a one-off adaptation last year, Perez, played with natural ease by Douglas Henshall, now returns for a trio of two-part mysteries. In an atmospheric opening rather reminiscent of ITV’s hit whodunit Broadchurch, a 17-year-old girl is found strangled to death on a secluded beach. Strong suspects include the victim’s “down with the kids” schoolteacher, the town’s resident rich philanderer and an eccentric recluse (played by craggy character actor Brian Cox) whose cottage overlooks the crime scene. Is one of this shady trio the murder culprit? And is there a link to the unsolved disappearance of another local girl 19 years ago? Scandi-crime fans will relish the chunky knitwear, rugged landscapes and angst-ridden characters, while there are echoes of Poe and Hitchcock in the eerie use of ravens. Henshall credibly portrays Perez as he methodically goes about his investigation. However, he doesn’t touch a dram in this opening episode and even breaks into a smile on a couple of occasions. He clearly needs to consult his “dour Scottish detective” handbook. MH
Live Paralympic Winter Games
Channel 4 & More4, from 9.00am
Today’s events include thrilling ice sledge hockey match-ups and alpine skiing. The pick of the action is at 9.00am when fierce rivals Norway and Sweden will be clashing in the sledge hockey.

In the Rocky Mountains in the western United States, Professor Richard Fortey examines a 520 million-year-old fossilised seabed containing the remains of bizarre lifeforms – among them a fish with five eyes and a proboscis, worm-like scavengers covered in spikes, and a metre-long predator resembling a giant shrimp. Fortey, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum, explains how they have revolutionised our understanding about the beginnings of life. SH
Doll & Em
Sky Living, 10.00pm The friendship between Em (Emily Mortimer) and Doll (Dolly Wells) is ever-more strained in this clever, semi-improvised spoof. Actress Em continues to face a crisis of confidence on set and Doll exploits her role as her assistant to the full. With Doll making the most of her recent injury, Em loses her cool with her friend in front of cast and crew. Beautifully written, terrific stuff. SH
Insane Fight Club

RS
WEDNESDAY 12 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: Famous, Rich & Hungry
BBC One, 9.00pm
Whatever your opinion about Benefits Street, Channel 4’s recent dramatically divisive documentary series, it proved that television can still be provocative and really have the power to generate heated debate. Perhaps mindful of its impact, Love Productions, the company that made the programme is following it up with another exploration of life on the poverty line, now with added celebrity spin. This two-part series, part of the BBC’s ongoing commitment to Sports Relief, sees four reasonably famous faces forgo their lives of plenty in order to highlight the experience of those in Britain who regularly go hungry. Former EastEnders actress Cheryl Fergison, journalist and writer Rachel Johnson, Made in Chelsea’s Jamie Laing and Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Theo Paphitis each volunteer to stay with different families struggling to feed themselves. Before heading off, the stars meet Lily Caprani from the Children’s Society and community support worker Craig Last in order to prepare them for the experience. The celebrities are then given daily food budgets amounting to the price of a takeaway coffee. Their volunteer families live lives where a daily decision has to be made between eating and keeping warm. Food banks, currently on the rise in the UK, are indispensible. Accusations of exploitation will no doubt abound, but there is also the possibility that Famous, Rich & Hungry will bring home the hardships that some people in the UK must endure. TD
Collectaholics
BBC Two, 8.00pm
Fans of Antiques Roadshow may relish this new series presented by Mel Giedroyc and antiques expert Mark Hill.

Line of Duty
BBC Two, 9.00pm
The shocking climax to last week’s episode shows just how well this thrilling crime drama is written. What of poor DI Lindsay Denton (Keeley Hawes) now? Also tonight, Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) puts his career on the line in order to pursue a high-level target. RW

Astronauts: Living in Space
Channel 4, 9.00pm
If you thought that life in space was literally out of this world then think again. There’s still the rubbish to take out, the windows to clean and daily exercise to do. This first of three programmes, made with Nasa, documents what life is really like outside of Earth’s atmosphere. Here, three astronauts reveal the effects of microgravity on their bodies. RW Who Needs Ibiza? The Great British Holiday
BBC Three, 9.00pm
Europa Park is an 18-30’s campsite in Woolacombe, Devon, which aims to bring some Mediterranean style fun to Brits on a budget. This raucous new series follows the owners, the Toms family, as they and their young staff try to beat the stormy summer and entertain the partying holidaymakers. SH
How to Get Ahead
BBC Four, 9.00pm
Presenter Stephen Smith provides a lively account of what it took to be a success in medieval times, specifically during the reign of Richard II. The royal court in the 14th century could make or break you and Richard’s was a place of shifting sands with courtiers having a stressful time as they tried to stay in favour. Getting ahead was a question of knowing the right moves and Smith has a list of 18 “rules”, including being the king’s champion, knowing your place and proclaiming your allegiance. However, Richard was prone to be spiky, capricious and peevish and he craved absolute power. Smith also suggests that he was “too modern for his time”, while David Tennant, who has played the king on stage, says he was a bit like Michael Jackson because, from a very young age, Richard II was treated “not as other men”. SH
The Miners’ Strike and Me
ITV, 10.35pm; UTV/STV, 11.05pm
“Eighty-four was the changing of a world. There was a way of life in Britain being wiped out. Not just for the miners, but for society in general.” The words of one former miner capture the thoughts of many involved in the 1984 strike against pit closures, in which Margaret Thatcher’s government intervened. To mark the 30th anniversary of the dispute, this documentary interviews police, miners and then-cabinet minister Michael Heseltine, who has historical family links to the mining industry. RW
THURSDAY 13 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: How to Be a Billionaire
Channel 4, 10.00pm
There are 1,400 billionaires in the world, yet we know little about most of them. The ultra-rich tend to be elusive, publicity-shy figures but this jaunty film drags three into the spotlight. Two turn out to be dreaming big and funding futuristic projects. The third, amusingly, seems more interested in opening pubs. In the former category is Indian entrepreneur Naveen Jain, who made his fortune through e-commerce and now runs his own space programme in Seattle. In a plan that could make him the world’s first trillionaire, he’s aiming to land on the moon next year, before launching commercial space flights. The evangelical Jain explains that he’s driven by a desire to improve lives, rather than profit. “Making money is a by-product of doing things you enjoy, never a goal in itself,” he says, behind the wheel of his black Ferrari. “It’s like sex and orgasms. You have to enjoy the process and not just focus on the end goal.” Jain seems a model of sanity compared to Russian media tycoon Dmitry Itskov, who is heading a worldwide project in pursuit of immortality, via mind-controlled robots, brain transplants and full-blown human avatars. Lastly and refreshingly, British geek Michael Birch is altogether more normal. This computer programmer from Hertforshire sold his social network Bebo at the peak of the dotcom bubble and now lives off the proceeds. He has a bar in his house, one in his office and is opening another to the public. Your round, Mr Birch. MH
Live Paralympic Winter Games: 2014

Hidden Histories: WWI’s Forgotten Photographs
BBC Four, 9.00pm
This film about the photographs taken by men from all ranks on both sides of the First World War is personal, moving, and unexpectedly surprising. Many of the images featured in it were hidden away after the war, with the men who took the photographs wanting to forget the past. But the pictures are finally coming to light and they capture images that are neither official nor staged (for a time the British high command banned soldiers from taking pictures). Using the new “Vest Pocket Kodak”, the soldiers’ photos capture the effects of the war and give an insight into its battles. What is surprising is how the images from both sides are so similar and focus on friendship and camaraderie. SH
The Walshes
BBC Four, 10.00pm Following Mrs Brown’s Boys and Moone Boy comes another Irish comedy, this time from Father Ted (and The IT Crowd) writer Graham Linehan. The knockabout sitcom follows the ups and downs of the loveably dysfunctional Walsh family who live in the fictional west Dublin suburb of Strollinstown. Star of the show is “mammy” Carmel (Philippa Dunne), who tries to maintain order over her “eejit” – but quick-witted – taxi driver husband Tony (Niall Gaffney), gormless unemployed son Rory (Rory Connolly) and despairing daughter Ciara (Amy Stephenson). SH
Arkle: The Legend Lives On
Channel 4, 11.05pm
Voted Britain and Ireland’s all-time favourite racehorse in a Racing Post poll, the Irish steeplechaser is long-remembered. On the 50th anniversary of Arkle’s victory over Mill House in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, this super documentary compares the thoroughbred to the modern greats. RS
FRIDAY 14 MARCH
CRITIC’S CHOICE: I Was There: The Great War Interviews
BBC Two, 9.00pm
“I’d never seen so many dead men clumped together. I thought to myself the world is dead. They’re all dead.” The BBC’s First World War commemorations have already seen some fine contributions and the coming months will see legions of historians and talking heads debate further the conflict as a great clash of competing global powers. In the end though, none can convey its horror and tragedy like the poor souls who suffered it at first hand on the battlefields and at home. This hugely moving documentary revives and restores an extraordinary treasure trove of interview material recorded by the BBC for its landmark 1964 series The Great War, bringing it to the screen after 50 years in storage at the Imperial War Museum – much of it for the very first time. From the psychological horrors of artillery bombardment to the haunted memories of men forced to become killers, or wishing for death above survival, nearly 300 eyewitness accounts of life in the trenches and on the home front were recorded for the series. But only a tiny fraction of the material made it to air at the time. Five decades on, listening to these men and women recount their experiences is like having access to the living past – so much so that the introduction’s grandiose claim that this is the “closest we will ever get to what it was like for those who were there” seems justified by the end. A further 13 films, featuring selected interviews in full, are to be made permanently available on BBC iPlayer. GOD

Channel 4, from 11.30am

In Their Own Words: 20th Century Composers
BBC Four, 8.00pm
The best feature of the In Their Own Words series (previous shows have focused on scientists, novelists and artists), has been the wonderful archive footage and tonight’s episode includes Arnold Schoenberg playing tennis and Richard Strauss with his grandchildren. The film illustrates the huge changes that classical music underwent in the first half of the 20th century, while Olivier Messiaen’s account of writing his most significant work in a PoW camp perfectly captures what it took to be a composer in turbulent times.

The Byrd Who Flew Alone BBC Four, 9.00pm
West Coast folk-rockers The Byrds have sometimes been described as “America’s Beatles” and one of the band’s brightest stars was its enigmatic singer Gene Clark who died aged 46 in 1991 following a long battle with drugs and alcohol. Subtitled ”The triumphs and tragedy of Gene Clark”, this documentary chronicles his successes and misfortunes, looking at his life and work, the contradictions in his personality and the rivalries within the band – and asks why “the father of Americana” is not better appreciated today. Numerous talking heads, including family and friends and former band members Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman, are among those paying tribute to the great man. SH

BBC crisis: George Entwistle to keep £450,000 pay-off
George Entwistle, the former director-general of the BBC, is to defy ministers and keep his £450,000 pay-off, The Daily Telegraph has learned.

Earlier this week the Prime Minister and the Culture Secretary said that the pay-out was “hard to justify” and urged Mr Entwistle to forfeit part of it. However, a source close to Mr Entwistle said he planned to keep the severance pay, which is twice as the amount as he was entitled to under the terms of his contract. Yesterday, Mr Entwistle was defended by former colleagues who said he was entitled to the compensation after having his career “destroyed in full view of the entire world”. Simon Smith, the head of TV Operations at BBC Vision, said he deserved the pay-off after becoming the victim of a “political and media witch hunt”. Mr Entwistle resigned after Newsnight was forced to issue an “unreserved” apology to Lord McAlpine after it broadcast a report that smeared him as a paedophile. Related Articles

12 Nov 2012
He stood down on Saturday night after just 54 days in the job but left the corporation with a lump sum of £450,000 on top of his £877,000 pension. The pay-off is equivalent to £8,333 for every day he spent as director-general. Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC, admitted earlier this week that he gave Mr Entwistle a pay-off worth twice as much as he was entitled to so he would go quietly. On Monday Maria Miller, the Culture Secretary, urged Mr Entwistle to forfeit part of his severance payment. “This payout is difficult to justify,” she said. “It is for Mr Entwistle to decide whether it is appropriate to accept this payment.”
However, a source close to Mr Entwistle said: “He is not going to give any of the money back. It’s very unlikely he will shift on this position.”
Mr Entwistle was yesterday defended by a fellow executive. In a letter to BBC staff magazine Ariel, Mr Smith said that critics were “ignoring” the fact that Mr Entwistle had an “exemplary career”. He said: “In all the endless copy and comment regarding the DG’s severance pay, one important fact has either been played down or completely ignored. “George devoted 23 years of his life to this organisation, building an exemplary career and earning the respect and devotion of everyone lucky enough to have ever worked with him. “Anyone who doubts that need only to have experienced the atmosphere of sadness and disillusionment which hung over BBC Vision teams last Monday.”
He said that Mr Entwistle had fallen victim to “the ineptitude and silence of others”. He said: “has now lost his job and been the victim of a political and media witch-hunt, which is a damning indictment of the society in which we all now live. “George has not been 'rewarded for 54 days of failure’. “He has been compensated for having his BBC career destroyed in full view of the entire world. In the circumstances, it is the very least he and his family deserve. “He should now have his privacy respected and be given time to recover from an experience which no-one would wish on their worst enemy, let alone a man of his intelligence, wit, vision, integrity and all round decency.”
According to William Hill, Ed Richards, chief executive of Ofcom, is favourite for the post with odds of 10/11, closely followed by Tim Davie, the acting director-general, who has odds of 2/1. Caroline Thomson, the BBC’s former chief operating officer, is 5/2 and Lord Hall is 5/1. Fran Unsworth, the new temporary head of BBC News, has appealed to staff not to Tweet about “our problems” as she tries to sort out the mess of the Newsnight scandal. Referring to the “tumultuous and very sad events of the past few days”, Ms Unsworth sent an email to the corporation’s staff saying: “It would be helpful if some of our problems were not played out publically across social media and in the pages of the national press.”

But his likely transfer to the Bernabéu has drawn a cool response from Cristiano Ronaldo, currently the world’s most expensive player. Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, and Florentino Pérez, the Real Madrid president, are expected to meet in Miami on Wednesday to discuss the Spanish club’s latest offer. Although there is a degree of resignation at Tottenham over Bale’s likely departure, there are significant sticking points over the structure of the deal. Madrid have had one offer in excess of £80 million rejected, with Levy keen on an up-front cash deal that would also involve Madrid striker Álvaro Morata joining Tottenham. Madrid have so far suggested only Ángel di María and Fabio Coentrao as makeweights, with Levy far more attracted by the option of Morata, who was the top scorer in Spain’s winning team in the European Under-21 Championships.

However the deal is constructed, Ronaldo reacted coldly when asked for his opinion on the prospect of the Welshman joining Real. “It’s not my place to comment on new players,” said Ronaldo, who joined the Spanish side for £80 million from Manchester United four years ago. “I am very happy with the players that I have by my side at the moment. "It’s not for me to talk about the figures being talked about for players. The president and the coach are qualified to talk about that.”
The response contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic endorsement for Bale from other Madrid players. Ronaldo was more effusive when asked about Isco, Asier Illarramendi and Dani Carvajal, the three players who Real have already signed. “I am very content with the new players,” said Ronaldo. “They are all quality players who are going to bring a lot to the squad. They are all Spanish players and they know the league.”
Although Tottenham did speak with Real at Bale’s request, the situation has become increasingly tense. Bale has set his heart on joining Madrid but Tottenham have been angered at the aggressive and very public pursuit of their best player. If Levy is not given any indication that Real are prepared to meet his demands over Morata or a straight cash deal, he may yet refuse to meet Pérez. Levy has a property in Florida and Pérez is with Real in Miami as they prepare for their match against Chelsea in the final of the International Champions Cup. Although the final decision on such a huge deal will rest with Joe Lewis, Tottenham’s majority owner, it is Levy who has so far conducted negotiations with Pérez. There was also a suggestion on Monday that Bale himself could attempt to force through a move by refusing to train. A foot injury ruled him out of the match against Monaco on Saturday and the Spanish newspaper AS claimedon Monday that Bale was “very upset” at the assertion from his manager, Andre Villas-Boas, that he will not be leaving. Bale, however, did report for treatment at the club’s Enfield base on what was a day off and the expectation is that he will train on Tuesday. A full first-team session is scheduled and, with a home friendly looming on Saturday against Espanyol, Tottenham want to assess Bale’s foot and fitness. They have made it clear that any player refusing to train or play would face an internal club fine. Bale has not played any first-team football since the first pre-season friendly against Swindon on July 16 and informed Tottenham of his desire to leave while in Hong Kong for the Barclays Asia Trophy. Ronaldo, meanwhile, was non-commital when asked to comment on suggestions from Pérez that he had already agreed to finish his career at Madrid. “I don’t know what the future holds. Let’s wait and see what happens. But for now I am a Madrid player and I am content with that.”
Ronaldo also denied reports that he has agreed a contract extension until 2018 worth an extraordinary £282,000-a-week. “No, there is still no solution,” said Ronaldo. Ronaldo faces his former coach, Jose Mourinho, on Wednesday night and the deterioration in their relationship appeared evident on Monday. Mourinho referred to the Brazilian Ronaldo as the ‘real Ronaldo’ in a recent interview. “Some things are not worth commenting on,” said the Portuguese Ronaldo. “I am used to having to speak about people that have spoken about me. There is a Portuguese phrase that comes to mind: ‘Don’t spit on the plate you eat from.’ ”
