MPs could be forced to debate 'Granny Tax'
More than 90,000 pensioners sign petition asking MPs to rethink tax plans.

MPs could soon be forced to debate the so-called "Granny Tax" due to come into force this April, as a petition calling for its abolition has attracted almost 100,000 signatures. After the e-petition was featured in a recent article in The Telegraph, the number of signature jumped from 75,000 to more than 91,000. If a further 9,000 sign this should trigger a parliamentary debate on this issue. Those signing are protesting against the latest tax grab on pensioners – which is due to raise £3.5bn. In April the Government plans to abolish the special age-related tax allowances which pensioners have enjoyed since 1925. These currently give pensioners a higher tax allowance than the general public, so they can earn an extra £3,000 from pensions or savings before paying income tax. However, this allowance does not apply to the richest pensioners, as a clawback facility means that pensioners with an income of £27,000 or more do not benefit from this higher personal allowance.

Equitable pensioners 'still waiting for justice'

Under current plans anyone who reaches their 65th birthday after April 5th this year will now longer qualify for this higher allowance, and it will be frozen for those already in receipt of it – meaning its value will be seriously eroded over time. Ros Altmann an economist and leading pensions specialist said: "I am not against a simplification of the tax system, but the politicians really need to look at whether this is the fairest way to achieve this." As she points out this change hits middle-income savers hardest. "Those who are reliant solely on their state pension, and who have not saved for their retirement are not going to be affected as they don't get enough income to pay tax. The wealthiest pensioners are similarly unaffected."
But those who have "done the right thing and tried to be self-reliant, often in quite difficult circumstances" now stand to lose out as a result of these changes, she said. At the same time many of these savers are being squeezed by other areas of policy: with the rates paid on savings plunging, thanks to historically low interest rates and the Government's new Funding for Lending scheme. Baroness Joan Bakewell, a campaigner for older people called these changes "fundamentally unfair". She said: "The claim that it makes things simpler for pensioners to understand just adds insult to injury."
Neil Duncan-Jordan, a spokesman for the National Pensioners Convention – which has launched this online petition – said: ""We want as many people as possible to sign the petition as we need to get the plight of pensioners higher up the political agenda. We do not object to harmonising the tax regimes of those in work and people who are retired. But it should not be done by penalising pensioners."
The Coalition defended its policy, saying that as the personal allowance for all is rising, it is no longer necessary to make pensioners a special case. According to the Government, 4.4 million pensioners will lose an average £83 in the 2013-14 tax year. However, many could find themselves paying up to £479 more tax next year, or £511 if they are aged over 75, than they might have expected before this change, costing a couple nearly £1,000. In the current tax year, for example, the personal allowance for under-65s rose by £630 to £8,105, and is due to leap again to £9,440 in April, with a target of £10,000 during this parliament. Ms Altmann added: "As recently as 2011, George Osborne said that the age-related allowance would be increase in line with inflation, as measured by the Retail Price Index. Now we find that it has been taken away for some, and frozen for others."

Vauxhall Insignia review
Andrew English ponders whether the changes to the 2014 model year Vauxhall Insignia go far enough.
4
Cosmetic changes to the 2014 model year Vauxhall Insignia include new bumpers, headlights and front grille By Andrew English
5:17PM BST 25 Sep 2013
Comments
I overheard a couple of colleagues talking about the discounts availabe on the Vauxhall Insignia recently. This 2009 Car of the Year is still doing good business, selling 32,610 in the UK last year, yet apparently they can be had for just four-figure sums. "Yeah, but it's an Insignia," said one as if that explained everything. The problem is that however well the Insignia drives, rides and sells, people still see it as a prestige-free repmobile. In the UK, where at least 80 per cent of the 167,000 Insignias sold since 2009 have gone to business customers, Vauxhall doesn't do itself any favours by allowing sub-10-grand new cars on the forecourt. It's Britain's fleet market which distorts and corrupts values. Even BMW, which sells more of its 3-series models than Vauxhall sells Insignias, is not immune to discounting. As Stuart Harris, Vauxhall marketing expert, says: "the premium makers have now got a taste for volume, but sometimes that's a bitter taste."

The facelifted Insignia is on sale now for delivery in October as a five-door hatchback, four-door saloon and "Sports Tourer" estate, with the range priced from £16,279 to £29,329. Scope those new headlamps, grille and more coherent brightwork. The Insignia was one of the first Vauxhalls to benefit from design chief Mark Adams' new-form philosophy and this update is designed to make it look lower and wider. All the sheet metal is carried over, as is the underbody, but the tailgate is new. I used to like the old model with its pert tail and although the facelift makes it look more modern, it's also slightly fussy. Step inside and you can see why you might learn to love a non-premium car for reasons other than price. Unlike German rivals, Vauxhall/Opel is neither in thrall to the Apple Corporation, nor cowering like ignorant medieval villagers from the voodoo technology of touchscreens. The dash is simple but well finished, the combined digital/analogue instrument binnacle works well and the large optional touchscreen, with its accompanying touch pad is both clearly marked and relatively easy to use. There are simple icons you can move around the screen, or if you use two fingers on the touch pad it will scroll, three fingers and you access a favourites menu, including phone numbers, tunes, destinations or a selection of 'curated' apps. The software isn't the world's most straightforward, but fiddling and Anglo Saxon gets you there in the end and if you are of the Luddite persuasion, you can download a smart phone handbook app, which you point at the switch in question for a tutorial. What's clear here is that Vauxhall has grown up. The colour choices are warm and welcoming, the fit and finish is as good as anything from Audi or BMW. The plain, dark plastics lovely to touch and the contrasting nappa leather is a delight. Remember, though, that this is a fleet car, and that leather costs an extra £3,000. I wasn't convinced by the standard seats, but the optional £1,149 orthopedically designed driver's seat is one of the most comfortable chairs you'll find outside of a Volvo. There's plenty of room in the back for two six-foot adults and the boot is a healthy 530 litres. Even this simplified range is bewildering. The Insignia is available with four four-cylinder petrol engines and four diesel options, all variations of the same 2.0-litre, four-cylinder unit delivering power outputs of between 118bhp and 192bhp and CO2 emissions of between 99g/km and 125g/km. There's also a new 320bhp, 170mph 4x4 VXR model and a Country Tourer 4x4 estate. Both cars use twin electronically controlled Haldex clutch packs, the first to direct up to 40 per cent of the engine's torque to the rear wheels, the second to direct torque to the rear wheel with the most grip. The Country Tourer arrives in January, with prices starting at £25,349, and the VXR will cost from £29,749. We concentrated on the £21,159, 161bhp diesel, which will occupy about 30 per cent of sales. It returns 65.7mpg on the Combined cycle, emits 114g/km of CO2, and attracts 17 per cent benefit-in-kind tax. Of six basic trim levels we chose SRI, which comes with that ergonomic driver's seat as standard, but not the £1,200 large touchscreen. It's quick enough to make a satisfying drive, but economical (we managed 49.6mpg). Refinement at speed is good and noise levels are low, but there's an annoying vibration as the engine revs drop towards 1,000rpm, so you need to row it along below 45mph. Not really a problem, because although the gearlever is a monstrosity, the change quality is precise, if a little stiff. Vauxhall/Opel engineers have worked hard at the suspension. Front MacPherson struts have specially shaped compliant top mounts to help the wheels roll over bumps and potholes. New bushes and dampers are fitted all round and the multi-link independent rear has new springs. The suspension was honed in Britain as well as Germany and it shows. A week before the German elections, driving the Insignia near Frankfurt was like driving through a party political broadcast, all corners obscured by grinning images of politicians bearing a startling resemblance to either Thelma from Scooby Doo or the Hoff. Eventually we found a bumpy, twisting road and could clearly determine that the Insignia's ride is more compliant and comfortable. Vauxhall says the handling hasn't been compromised in the process and we'd agree. There's a lightness to the major controls and a mostly progressive build up of steering loads. The electronically assisted system can be inconsistent, however, and has an over-centre feel particularly in the Sport mode of the £790 Flexride system. There's also not much feedback through the wheel even when pressing on, which inhibits spirited driving. That said, the chassis is well balanced and understeer and body roll are reasonably well controlled. So, good just got better. The Insignia is still a great car and it seems a pity we all spend our money on other German cars - with flashier badges - since they're not necessarily better. VAUXHALL INSIGNIA
Engine/transmission: 1956cc four-cylinder turbodiesel with double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Six-speed manual transmission (optional six-speed auto) driving the front wheels (opt 4x4 system) Price/on sale: From £16,279 to £29,329. As tested in SRI 163PS CDTi form, £21,159. On sale November Power/torque: 161bhp @ 4,000rpm, 258lb ft @ 1,750rpm. Top speed: 136mph Acceleration: 0-62mph 9.5sec. Fuel economy: 52.3mpg/65.7mpg EU Urban/Combined. On test 49.6mpg. CO2 emissions: 114g/km VED band: C - £0 for the first year, £30 thereafter Verdict: Good just got better, with an improved ride quality, classier cabin, a bit of felt-tip fandango on the exterior and quieter high speed running. Not the greatest driving machine, but comfortable and competent. Telegraph rating: Four out of five stars. RIVALS
Ford Mondeo (from £15,995) The blue oval's ship of the line is getting rather long in the tooth, with a much delayed replacement due at the end of next year. It still makes a fine drive, with better handling than most, but the ride is showing its age and we're waiting for some new engines. Don't pay retail prices... Peugeot 508 (from £19,105) This is the first of the new-look Peugeots under design head Gilles Vidal. It's handsome with a lovely and comfortable cabin, although some of the fleet-friendly driveline and suspension combinations don't sparkle. Avoid the ponderous semi-automatic transmission. Hyundai i40 (from £18,765) Well made and stylish, and there's the benefit of a five-year warranty, but not quite as plush or as good to drive as the best. Worth consideration, though. Vauxhall

BBC in chaos as abuse victim says Lord McAlpine was not my attacker
The BBC is mired in a fresh crisis after the key witness in a Newsnight report alleging that senior Tory Lord McAlpine was a paedophile admitted that he identified the wrong man.
By Sam Marsden, and Gordon Rayner
10:00PM GMT 09 Nov 2012
Follow Steve Messham, whose claims prompted David Cameron to open new inquiries into the north Wales child sex abuse scandal, said he had wrongly named Lord McAlpine as his attacker. The Conservative grandee, a party treasurer under Baroness Thatcher, was not identified in the Newsnight programme eight days ago. But yesterday his lawyers accused the current affairs programme of “taking the coward’s way out” by encouraging people to seek out the accused politician’s name on the internet. Breaking his silence for the first time since the scandal erupted, Lord McAlpine condemned the “wholly false and seriously defamatory” claims against him. His solicitors suggested that they would sue Newsnight, which was previously heavily criticised after it dropped an investigation into Jimmy Savile’s decades of child abuse. Rob Wilson, a Conservative MP, said the Nov 2 broadcast alleging that a senior Thatcher-era Tory was a paedophile had triggered a “wave of innuendo and smears”. Related Articles

He added: “This brings into question whether their report was either fair or responsible. It is my view that this report was at best ill-advised and at worst incendiary, and could have damaged the reputation of an innocent man.”
The BBC “unreservedly” apologised last night for broadcasting the child sex abuse allegations. In a statement the BBC said of its 2 November Newsnight programme: “We broadcast Mr Messham’s claim but did not identify the individual concerned. Mr Messham has tonight made a statement that makes clear he wrongly identified his abuser and has apologised. “We also apologise unreservedly for having broadcast this report.” The BBC said director general George Entwistle had designated a senior news executive to supervise last night’s edition of Newsnight. BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie will write an urgent report for Mr Entwistle covering what happened on the programme’s investigation into the north Wales children’s home scandal. In the meantime there will be an immediate pause in all Newsnight investigations to assess editorial robustness and supervision. The BBC is also suspending all co-productions with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism which worked with Newsnight on the investigation. The apology was was read out in full at the start of last night’s Newsnight programme and the first section of the show was given over to the controversy. Presenter Eddie Mair ended the programme by saying: “Newsnight will be back on Monday, probably.” The latest BBC furore raises questions about whether Newsnight rushed into running a highly sensitive child abuse story in an attempt to rebuild its credibility after the damaging controversy over the scrapped Savile investigation. Several commentators pointed out the bitter irony of the programme’s failure to identify a genuine paedophile before it targeted an innocent man. Andrew Neil, the broadcaster, said the very future of Newsnight was now in doubt. Lord McAlpine has released a strongly-worded statement addressing the “slurs” against him Lord McAlpine’s name circulated widely online after Mr Messham, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn care home in Wrexham, told the programme that he had been repeatedly abused by a high-ranking Tory politician. However, evidence emerged yesterday suggesting that the peer had been mistaken for another member of the McAlpine family. Mr Messham confirmed last night that he had been wrong and issued a statement in which he offered his “sincere and humble apologies” to Lord McAlpine. He also suggested that journalists working for Newsnight had not shown him a photograph of the Tory peer to confirm his identity. He said: “After seeing a picture in the past hour of the individual concerned, this [is] not the person I identified by a photograph presented to me by the police in the early 1990s, who told me the man in the photograph was Lord McAlpine.”
Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said they would take legal action against “all media” who had defamed his reputation. They singled out Newsnight and ITV1’s This Morning, which was criticised after a list of supposed paedophiles was inadvertently shown to viewers as the presenter Phillip Schofield handed it to Mr Cameron. Andrew Reid, of RMPI LLP, the solicitors who are representing Lord McAlpine, said the two “respected” programmes had between them informed most of the country about “something that simply is a complete lie”. “What I think is so wrong is that Newsnight trailed this and encouraged people that some major revelation was going to come about, and that they actually were going to name this individual, but then they took what I think is the coward’s way out,” he told Radio 4’s PM. “They ran the programme, trailed it and then told everyone where to go and look for the name. In my view that’s just creating the defamation. They have done a very, very good job of severely damaging Lord McAlpine’s reputation.”
Lord McAlpine released a strongly-worded statement yesterday addressing the “slurs” against him. He said he had visited Wrexham only once, and that was in the company of an agent from Conservative Central Office. “I have never been to the children’s home in Wrexham, nor have I ever visited any children’s home, reform school or any other institution of a similar nature,” he said. “I have never stayed in a hotel in or near Wrexham, I did not own a Rolls-Royce, have never had a 'Gold card’ or 'Harrods card’ and never wear aftershave, all of which have been alleged. “I did not sexually abuse Mr Messham or any other residents of the children’s home in Wrexham.”
Keith Gregory, a local councillor who was also a victim of abuse at Bryn Estyn, said he believed a different member of the McAlpine family may have been mistaken for Lord McAlpine. Several people suggested that Mr Messham may have been referring to the late Jimmie McAlpine, a former chairman of the building firm Alfred McAlpine Ltd, who lived in Chester, near Wrexham. But Malcolm King, a Labour councillor who helped to expose the cover-up of abuse in north Wales, described Jimmie to The Daily Telegraph as loving “eating, drinking, ladies, cricket and golf” and said he had “no knowledge of him doing anything wrong”. The Waterhouse inquiry into the north Wales abuse recorded that, according to Mr Messham’s statement to the police, “X [the letter used to hide the identity of the McAlpine family member] had several different motor cars and would wait for him at the bottom of Bryn Estyn Lane.”
Jimmie McAlpine had one of the largest private collections of cars in Britain. His widow, Cynthia, 71, described her former husband as a “real gentleman” and said there was “absolutely no way” the allegations were true. Mr Wilson wrote to Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, asking him to investigate the Newsnight’s report and questioned whether the politician was given a right of reply. The BBC said in a statement: “Newsnight broadcast an investigation into alleged failures in a child abuse inquiry. It worked with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to give a voice to concerns raised by an abuse victim. “It was in the public interest to air these. We did not name any public figure for legal reasons. It is now for the inquiries announced by the Home Secretary to dig deeper into Mr Messham’s concerns.”
Almost 50 recordings of a Jimmy Savile BBC radio show in which he can apparently be heard behaving inappropriately with young girls have been passed to police. The audio clips, from the 1970s show Savile’s Travels, were discovered by an archivist in Finland. The BBC has been unable to verify the authenticity of the recordings, three of which have been made available online. A comment left by a member of the public on the BBC website in the days after Savile’s death has also been referred to police. Politics

Why Philadelphia really is a big cheese
Though derided by famed son W C Fields, Philadelphia is a city to savour, says Teresa Levonian Cole.
Philadelphia, as any Greek will tell you, is the City of Brotherly Love, so named by the British Quaker William Penn By Teresa Levonian Cole
3:42PM GMT 11 Mar 2013
Comments
"I once spent a year in Philadelphia; I think it was on a Sunday," quipped W C Fields in one of his long-running digs at the city of his birth. Poor Philly. She lacks the glamour of New York, the edge of Chicago or Boston's reputation for quasi-British gentility. And yet, as I discovered, Philadelphia conceals a clutch of cultural aces – among others, America's first opera house (the Academy of Arts), America's first theatre (the Walnut Street), the nation's oldest art institution (the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts) and the largest concentration of 18th-century architecture in the US (Society Hill), as well as an orchestra that ranks among America's "Big Five" and a thriving restaurant scene. Philadelphia, as any Greek will tell you, is the City of Brotherly Love (philos meaning friend or love; adelphi meaning brother), so named by the British Quaker, William Penn, when he landed here in 1682 armed with a land charter from King Charles II in settlement of a debt. A Quaker heritage, which persists to this day, has much to do with the quiet philanthropy that informs the city's cultural scene. "Quaker values are about modesty and simple living," says Carlos Basualdo, curator of contemporary art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA), whose magnificent collection of 227,000 items is formed almost entirely from bequests. "We are much less flashy here than, say, in New York. Perhaps that is why we do not trumpet what we have to offer." Nevertheless, 610,000 people annually visit Philadelphia. Most head first for the historic Liberty Bell, its E-flat toll silenced by a giant crack which occurred, ironically enough, on George Washington's birthday (February 22) in 1846. They then cross the road to Independence Hall where, in 1776, the Declaration of Independence and, 11 years later, the American Constitution were signed. Related Articles

Portland, Oregon: wine country, cuisine capital
14 Nov 2012
I had come to see the city's famed museums, and had not expected so many competing claims for my attention. First on my long list of must-sees was the PMA's exhibition of Marcel Duchamp alongside his friends and collaborators, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, John Cage and Merce Cunningham – an ambitiously cerebral yet engaging exhibition combining art, music and dance [now at London's Barbican until June 9]. The monumental 1928 museum building itself, known, for its Revivalist style, as the "Great Greek Garage", stands at one end of Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the 19th-century diagonal that cuts a swathe through William Penn's original grid design for the city. Three generations of Calders provide historic continuity along this avenue, from the equally impressive Second Empire City Hall – whose crowning bronze statue of the city's founder was created in the 1890s by Alexander Milne Calder, through the Swann Fountain by his son, Alexander Stirling Calder, to the "Ghost" mobile of Alexander Calder III, which hangs inside the entrance of the museum. It was, incidentally, Duchamp who suggested to Calder that he name his kinetic sculptures "mobiles". One can only imagine the museum authority's thoughts when this axis of "The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost", as it is irreverently known, was interrupted by a giant statue of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, arms raised in triumph, placed atop the 72 steps of the museum. After several relocations, it has now found a more discreet home at the foot of what remain known as "the Rocky Steps", in honour of a scene in the eponymous film. The statue, meantime, has become almost as popular a photographic backdrop as Robert Indiana's iconic Love statue in John F Kennedy Plaza. A short hop away is the Rodin Museum, reopened last July after a $9 million restoration that returned the interior and exterior of the building to their original 1929 appearance. An architectural echo of the sculptor's tomb in Meudon, containing some 140 sculptures donated to the city by the movie theatre magnate Jules Mastbaum, it is the largest collection of Rodins outside Paris. Exceptionally, the Rodin Trustees permitted Mastbaum to commission a marble copy of The Kiss, which has now been returned to public view after 40 years in purdah. The architect of this Beaux-Arts building, Paul Cret, was also responsible for the original Barnes gallery in Merion which, last May, was relocated amid much brouhaha (because Barnes did not want the collection housed within the city) next door to the Rodin Museum, in a superb new building surrounded by Zen-like gardens, which completes a Golden Mile of museums along Parkway. Barnes, as heterogeneous in his tastes as Mastbaum was focused, amassed an astonishing collection that numbers 181 Renoirs, 69 Cézannes, 59 Matisses, dozens of Old Masters, and much, much more besides. The collection is displayed in 24 galleries exactly as the donor intended, interspersed with African art and Native American objects and metalwork, in a jumble of styles, eras and continents whose logic lies only in a rhythmic formality and often humorous visual punning. The scope of the collection, combined with the intimacy of the setting – large UV-filtering windows allowing natural light to illuminate the chubby impasto of Van Gogh's flowers, for example – is breathtaking. It is not often one visits a gallery and discovers works by great artists never before seen, even in reproduction. For me, at least, the Barnes was full of wow moments. Dizzy with images, I felt ready for more trivial pursuits. Like shopping, along elegant Walnut Street and Rittenhouse Row; exploring the independent boutiques and galleries of 3rd Street in the Old Town; trawling the renowned vintage shops of Fabric Row and shops of Antiques Row; and sampling Amish farm produce at Reading Terminal Market. Compact and human in scale, friendly in atmosphere, Philadelphia is a city made for walkers, divided into contrasting neighbourhoods and dissected by the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, whose banks sport the boat houses of the city's six proud universities, prettily illuminated at night (a scene popularised by the paintings of Thomas Eakins). Shanks's pony is the best way to experience the city's architectural heritage, wandering nose-in-air from cobblestoned Elfreth's Alley – the oldest continuously inhabited street in the United States, with narrow-fronted houses dating to 1702 – through the neoclassical and on to Frank Furness's bold and unorthodox 19th-century creations. And thence to contemporary masterpieces such as the Kimmel Centre, home of the renowned Philadelphia Orchestra, and the skyscrapers at Liberty Place which, in 1987, broke the unspoken agreement that no building should be taller than the statue of Penn, atop City Hall. On the 37th floor of No 2 Liberty Place, R2L, one of Philly's most sumptuous restaurants offers panoramic views over where you have just been. On the subject of restaurants – Philadelphia is blessed with a great many. From the humble hoagie and cheesesteak to the finest of fine dining, the city has more places to eat than you could ever want. Two of the leading restaurateurs in the city, Stephen Starr, with 21 differently themed restaurants, and José Garces – whose Chifa, one of seven in his stable, makes a triumph of the imponderable fusion of Latin, Asian and Peruvian cuisines – lead the pack and set the standard. Creativity is the name of the game – even the humblest pizzeria signs up to the fierce competition to create the zaniest cocktail. W C Fields, it's said, was fond of a tipple. I suspect he'd have found plenty to enjoy in Philadelphia today. What to avoid
Philadelphia is basically a safe city, but some parts of Northern Liberties are best avoided. The rather tacky South Street – unless it is to queue for cheesesteaks at Jim's. The displays at the famous Franklin Institute Science Museum are dated and the museum is rather disappointing – unless it is to loop the loop in a F-4 Phanthom jet simulator. GETTING THERE British Airways (0844 493 0787; ba.com) flies from Heathrow to Philadelphia from £553 return and US Airways (0845 600 3300; usairways.com) from £477 return. Check Flight Centre (0800 587 0058; flightcentre.co.uk) for cheap options. Traffic permitting, the airport is a 15-minute taxi ride from Center City. THE INSIDE TRACK A Philadelphia Pass (philadelphiapass.com) will buy you a 100-page guidebook and free entry to 30 museums and attractions, worth up to $400 (£266). From $49/£31 for a one-day adult pass, to $115/£72 for a five-day pass.
Don’t miss the Eastern State Penitentiary (easternstate.org). Built like a fortress, this massive, abandoned prison had plumbing and electricity before the White House, and was the world’s most expensive prison when it opened in 1829. Al Capone was an inmate, and had his tonsils removed here in 1929. Charles Dickens was among the early visitors to the prison, which served as a model for Europe and the colonies.
Take one of the popular private tours of the city’s Mural Arts – billed as the largest outdoor gallery in the world (001 215 925 3633). Take a day-trip to Longwood Gardens (longwoodgardens.org), 1,077 acres of beautiful woods and formal gardens, the land purchased in 1906 by chemical magnate Du Pont, to save it from a timber merchant. While at Longwood, drop in on the newly opened studio of Andrew Wyeth, one of America’s most-loved artists, and to the Brandywine Museum that features the works of three generations of Wyeth artists. (brandywinemuseum.org). Longwood is about an hour’s drive from the city.
Philadelphia has no tax on clothing or shoes (shoes are a particularly good buy). For one-stop shopping, King of Prussia Mall is the largest in America, while Philadelphia Premium Outlets (premiumoutlets.com/Philadelphia) is a bargain-hunter’s dream. Visit Mitchell & Ness (mitchellandness.com) for varsity jackets, repro vintage baseball jerseys and flannels are a must for fans of sporting nostalgia. THE BEST HOTELS Hotel Monaco £
This new hotel is located opposite Independence Hall in the Old Town and is notable for its contemporary design of bold, contrasting colours and clashing patterns. There’s a rooftop bar, and the adjoining Red Owl Tavern offers meals and friendly service. Expect to meet a very superior canine in the lifts of this dog-friendly hotel (001 215 925 2111; kimptonhotels.com; doubles from $206/£129 per night). The Ritz-Carlton ££ This magnificent domed 1908 building in Center City, originally a bank, was the work of architect Frank Furness. The adjoining skyscraper was added later and offers wonderful views from the classically designed bedrooms over the 37ft-high statue of William Penn on City Hall. The bar, located beneath the rotunda, is a popular meeting place. And there is a spa in which to unwind after shopping on neighbouring Walnut Street (523 8000; ritzcarlton.com; doubles from $225/£140). Rittenhouse Hotel £££
A member of Leading Hotels of the World, the city’s grande dame hotel on elegant Rittenhouse Square emphasises personal service – flowers of your choice placed in your room, for example, and even your room key imprinted with the flag of your home country. It is also home to the sophisticated and award-winning restaurant, Lacroix. (546 9000; rittenhousehotel.com; doubles from $287/£180) THE BEST RESTAURANTS Zavino £
A pizzeria with flair that offers great cold cuts and cheeses. Try the Stache pizza, with mozzarella, pistachio pesto and baby rocket (112 South 13th Street; 732 2400). The Oyster House ££ A buzzing and informal restaurant, offering a dozen different varieties of oyster, along with the freshest seafood. The Maryland crab cakes with sprout and pecan salad are divine (1516 Sansom Street; 567 7683). Vernick ££ New, young and sexy, with the slickest service, Vernick is perfectly judged, and features such delicacies as sea urchin with scrambled egg. Delicious (2031 Logan Street; 639 6644). Fountain Restaurant at the Four Seasons £££ Opposite the Swann Fountain in the heart of museum land, the Fountain is one of Philadelphia’s best fine-dining institutions. Flawless continental dishes, with service to match (1 Logan Square; 963 1500). USA
