Why it is harder for women to save for retirement
Only 50pc of women in their 30s work full–time and almost 20pc prioritise financially supporting their children above saving for retirement.
Gary and Laura Lurcock prefer the flexibility of saving into a joint cash account. By Nicole Blackmore

Most people struggle to put enough money away to fund a comfortable retirement – but the challenge is particularly difficult for women who take time out of work to raise a family. Research suggests that only 50pc of women in their 30s work full–time, compared with 81pc of men of the same age. Whether taking an extended career break or returning to work parttime, mothers will usually see their income reduce significantly. Combined with the added costs of raising a family, pensions are often relegated to the bottom of the priority list. Almost 20pc of women in their thirties prioritise financially supporting their children above saving for retirement, according to this year's Scottish Widows "Women and Pensions" Report. And 21pc of women in this age group expect to rely on their partner's income for retirement, according to the annual study. This can be a risky move – especially considering the rising divorce rate among couples in their fifties and sixties. There are steps women can take to boost their chances of a comfortable retirement. Your Money collected tips from financial planners on Unbiased.co.uk, the directory of advice firms, to help women plan. Related Articles

Maternity leave
Legislation requires employer and employee pension contributions to continue while a woman is on paid maternity leave. The length of paid leave will vary between companies but the statutory minimum is up to 39 weeks. Thanks to compound interest, any money saved into a pension in your twenties or thirties will work hard over the years to grow your retirement income. So continuing saving even a small amount can have a significant impact. Women who take longer than 12 months off work can be forced to leave the pension scheme – check with your employer. Protect your state pension
The new flat–rate state pension will be worth approximately £144 a week from 2016. Anyone with 35 years of qualifying National Insurance contributions will qualify for this. Stephen Womack, an adviser at David Williams Chartered Financial Planners, said women must not underestimate the importance of building up entitlement. "It would cost a woman aged 66 approximately £195,000 to buy that level of index–linked pension with their own savings," he said. Women who take time out of employment should continue building credits. This happens automatically if a family claims child benefit. It is worth registering even if one partner earns an annual salary of £60,000 or more and you must repay the benefit at the end of the tax year. Pension credits stop when the youngest child reaches 12 years of age, so if you haven't gone back into work by then, consider making voluntary National Insurance contributions. Save – but not necessarily into a pension
Most stay–at–home mothers will be a non or basic–rate taxpayer, so to put additional money into a pension would offer limited tax benefits. However, savers benefit from a 20pc tax relief boost on the first £2,880 of pension contributions per tax year, regardless of whether income is earned, turning the sum into £3,600. The same limits apply if someone else, such as a partner, makes contributions on your behalf. An Isa is often a better option. You can invest up to £11,520 in an Isa during this tax year – which at £960 a month is often sufficient – and your money grows tax–free. You can access the cash if you need, but be careful not to dip too deep into retirement savings. Back at work, you could move the money into a pension to generate tax relief – a good idea for women who pay higher–rate tax. Should you leave the company, consider transferring the pension to a self–invested personal pension (Sipp), which has greater investment control. However, check for valuable benefits offered by your company first, such as life cover or guaranteed payout rates on annuities. Don't rely solely on your partner's pension
Unfortunately, marriages do break down – around 42pc end in divorce across England, according to the Office for National Statistics. Pensions are frequently undervalued in divorce settlements, so make sure you have separate provision. Don't disregard saving as a couple, though – if the husband or partner is a higher–rate taxpayer or his employer will match some or all of any contribution he makes to his company scheme, it could be worthwhile using his scheme. 'It's hard to save when you've just had a baby'
Laura Lurcock, 28, is on maternity leave from her role as an administrator at Brighton & Hove council. She had her son, Joshua, four and a half months ago and plans to take 12 months' maternity leave before returning to work part–time. Mrs Lurcock has a company pension scheme, so her contributions will continue from her maternity pay. Her husband, Gary, 32, an operations manager, does not currently have a workplace pension. Mrs Lurcock said: "We decided to save as much as we can at the end of every month into a joint savings account and part of that is for our retirement. It's difficult to put much away because there are so many expenses that you just don't expect when you have a baby. "We like the flexibility of a savings account and the easy access to our money that an online cash account gives us."

Catherine Zeta Jones 'received treatment for manic depression'
Catherine Zeta Jones on Wednesday revealed that she sought treatment for manic depression after struggling to cope with the stress of husband Michael Douglas's battle with throat cancer.

The 41-year-old Welsh actor reportedly checked into a £770-a-day clinic in Connecticut for five days earlier this month. "After dealing with the stress of the past year, Catherine made the decision to check in to a mental health facility for a brief stay to treat her Bipolar II Disorder," said publicist Cece Yorke said in a statement. "She's feeling great and looking forward to starting work this week on her two upcoming films," she said. Bipolar disorder is the technical term for manic depression, and involves wild mood swings from high to low, though in Bipolar II the "up" moods never reach full mania. A friend told America's People magazine: "There's no question it's been a stressful year. Catherine has had deal with Michael's illness and that's been hard. She went in for a few days because she's about to start working, and wanted to make sure she's in top form, which she is."

Douglas, 66, underwent chemotherapy for stage four throat cancer last year but said in January his tumour had gone after six months of intensive treatment. His son Cameron from a previous marriage, was sentenced to prison last year on drug charges. Zeta Jones, who won an Oscar for her role in "Chicago", was photographed at Buckingham Palace in London in February where she was awarded a CBE medal by Prince Charles for her services to charity and the film industry. The couple, who wed in 2000, has a ten year old boy and seven year old girl. Zeta Jones will next appear in Playing the Field, with Gerard Butler. Health News

NHS care hit by more rationing
Rationing of treatment has increased in the NHS and GPs are now forced to apply for funding for IVF treatment, obesity surgery, and for drugs to stop people going blind, a report claims.
A Department of Health spokesman said: "It is unacceptable for the NHS to impose blanket bans for treatment on the basis of cost" Photo: Alamy	By Rebecca Smith, Medical Editor
11:43PM GMT 18 Nov 2012
The health service is struggling to save £20 billion over four years and a growing number of treatments are being restricted. Even essentials such as cataract surgery are being withheld in some areas, experts said. When a primary care trust refuses to fund treatment, GPs or other doctors can make an “individual funding request” on behalf of the patient and this is looked at by a panel of experts. A series of Freedom of Information Act requests has revealed that such requests increased by a fifth between 2010/11 and 2011/12. In England there were 85,200 requests last year, GP magazine found. As the number of requests has risen, the proportion approved has fallen, from 59 per cent in 2008/09 to 55 per cent in 2011/12. In some areas doctors have to request special funding for one in every 200 patients while in others it is just one in 11,000. Related Articles

Some patients have to rely on requests for cataract surgery and some therapies backed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence such as diabetes education and insulin pumps, GP found. A Department of Health spokesman said: “It is unacceptable for the NHS to impose blanket bans for treatment on the basis of cost.”
A report into the impact of the Blair government’s NHS reforms has revealed the proportion of patients seeing their local NHS trust has fallen significantly, while those referred to privately-owned centres has risen. The study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that in 2010/11, private sector treatment had gone from a “negligible presence” in outpatient care to accounting for 3.5 per cent – almost half a million – of all first appointments.

Cruising for Christmas Carol concerts, Nativity plays, visits from Santa – cruise ships really go to town at Christmas, says Sara Macefield.

Comments
Cruise lines do things in more than usually fine style at Christmas. Many spend thousands of pounds transforming their ships into Yuletide fun palaces, with huge Christmas trees, garlands, wreaths, ornate sleighs and handcrafted ornaments. Crystal Cruises, for example, lavishes around £50,000 on seasonal decorations for each of its ships, while P&O Cruises even flies out professional decorators to transform its Caribbean cruises. "It's a big operation for us," says the company's marketing spokeman, Philip Price. "It's not just a question of the captain going around and sticking up bits of holly."
And this is just for starters. Then there are the carol concerts, choirs, Nativity plays and Christmas Day church services. On some ships, Santa pops in with presents for every passenger and on P&O's hugely popular child-friendly vessels he even has his own grotto, complete with a gingerbread village. So which cruise? Experienced cruisers tend to look for the onboard atmosphere when it comes to choosing their Christmas trip, but first-timers often opt for fly-cruises in the Caribbean or other warm climates.

Then there's the question of whether to spend just a week away over Christmas or New Year, or go the whole hog and take a two-week trip over both. To help you choose, here is my selection of festive cruises that still have availability. Prices are per person and based on two people sharing, unless otherwise stated. Norway Hurtigruten (020 8846 2666; www.hurtigruten.co.uk), the Norwegian cruise specialist, lets you spend Christmas off the Norwegian coast on a five-day trip from Tromso to Bergen. The trip, which departs on December 22, visits the dramatic Lofoten Islands, where you can take a dog-sledding tour and observe a traditional fishing community. The voyage also offers a good chance of seeing the Northern Lights, as well close-up views of some of Europe's most spectacular coastline. The cost is from £775, including half board on the ship, transfers and flights from Heathrow. The Mediterranean MSC Cruises (0870 850 4883; www.msccruises.co.uk) has a 12-day Mediterranean fly-cruise from Genoa on December 18 from £799, including flights. The cruise, aboard MSC Musica, calls at Ajaccio, Malta, Rhodes, Egypt, Tripoli, Messina and Naples before returning to Genoa. The Canaries Fred Olsen cruises (01473 742424; www.fredolsencruises.co.uk) offers a 16-night Christmas and New Year to the Canary Islands aboard Black Watch, departing Dover on December 20. The first ports of call – La Coruña in Spain and Tangier in Morocco – allow for last-minute Christmas shopping before the ship docks at Arrecife, in Lanzarote, on Boxing Day. Subsequent stops include Las Palmas in Gran Canaria, Santa Cruz, Tenerife, San Sebastián in La Gomera and Santa Cruz, La Palma. New Year's Eve is spent in Funchal, Madeira, where guests welcome in the year with a fireworks display. Prices start at £1,866, which includes a 40 per cent discount. Travelscope (0844 412 4444; www.travelscope.co.uk) still has cabins on its 15-day Christmas and New Year "Sunshine Cruise" departing Falmouth on December 21 and visiting seven ports, including Vigo, Gibraltar on Christmas Day, Casablanca on Boxing Day and Funchal, Madeira, on New Year's Eve. Prices start at £899. The Caribbean Carnival Cruises (020 7940 4466; www.carnivalcruise.co.uk) still has space on a seven-night sailing from Miami on December 22 to the Eastern Caribbean. The cruise calls at Half Moon Cay, a private island in the Bahamas, St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, San Juan, Puerto Rico and Grand Turk in the Turks and Caicos islands. The cruise costs just £449, but you need to organise your own flights to Florida. Ocean Village (0845 358 5000; www.oceanvillageholidays.co.uk) is a casual cruise line, with laid-back trips where you could spend the festive season swimming with dolphins or roaring around on Harley-Davidson motorbikes. The company's "Coral & Calypso" seven-night sailing (from £1,179) departs Barbados on December 19, visiting Tortola, St Maarten, St Kitts, Antigua and Dominica. Passengers wanting a longer cruise can add a second sailing, the one-week "Sugar & Spice" voyage, which follows directly afterwards on December 26 and follows a different route. The price for the combined 14-night cruise is from £1,749, including return flights to Barbados. Royal Caribbean cruises (0845 165 8330; www.royalcaribbean.co.uk) is offering (among other things) an eggnog party, carol singing, Midnight Mass and a Christmas talent show on its 14-night Southern Caribbean fly-cruise on December 22. The cost is from £2,212, including flights and a one-night hotel stay. The 12-night cruise sails from New York for St Maarten, Antigua, Dominica, Barbados, St Kitts, St Thomas and Puerto Rico before returning to New York. Saga Cruises (0800 505030; www.saga.co.uk) has an option for customers wanting to avoid the airport crush of the festive getaway: drive to Southampton and step aboard the Saga Rose for a 30-night voyage, costing from £4,229, which departs December 6 and calls at the Azores before reaching the Caribbean, where stops include Tobago, Grenada, St Lucia and Antigua before returning to the UK via Madeira. SeaDream Yacht Club (0800 783 1373; www.seadream.com) is offering Christmas and New Year sailings on its SeaDream I luxury yacht. The Christmas voyage departs San Juan in Puerto Rico and calls at the uninhabited island of Culebrita, Esperanza – famous for its bioluminescent waters – and the Caribbean islands of St John, St Martin, St Barts, Virgin Gorda and Jost Van Dyke – before returning to Puerto Rico. The cruise-only price is from $5,112 (£2,560). The New Year sailing follows a similar path and costs from $5,433 (£2,720), cruise only. Ascension Island The Royal Mail Ship St Helena (020 7575 6480; www.rms-st-helena.com) lets you really get away from it all on a 128-berth boat that serves the remote South Atlantic outposts of Ascension Island and St Helena. Passengers can join the ship on December 21, when it departs Ascension Island for a three-night voyage to St Helena and then travels on to Walvis Bay in Namibia, where it arrives on December 29. This cruise costs from £452, but for an extra £160 passengers can sail from here to Cape Town, arriving on New Year's Day. Flights are not included. The US and Mexico Crystal Cruises (020 7287 9040; www.crystalcruises.com) still has availability on a 16-night fly-cruise from Los Angeles with calls at San Diego and Cabo San Lucas, before sailing to the Mexican resorts of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo, Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and La Paz (returning to Los Angeles). Prices start at £5,243 and include flights, an overnight stay in Los Angeles pre-cruise and transfers. On the 14-night sailing, basic gratuities and soft drinks are also included. Norwegian Cruise Line (0845 658 8010; www.ncl.co.uk) is offering a heady combination of New York and the Caribbean on one-week cruises departing the Big Apple on December 19 and 26. The line's newest ship, Norwegian Gem, cruises the Atlantic before calling at Port Canaveral in Florida (for Orlando), Key West and Great Stirrup Cay, NCL's private island in the Bahamas. It then returns to New York. The 11-night package, which includes three nights' room-only in New York, costs from £1,589, flights included. P&O Cruises (0845 678 0014; www.pocruises.com) offers those wanting a child-free festive season a trip through the Mexican Riviera on adult-only ship Arcadia. The 15-night fly-cruise departs on December 14 from Barbados, sailing through the Caribbean with calls at islands including Grenada, Bonaire and Aruba, before heading southwards along the coast of Latin America. Christmas Day is spent at sea between Fuerte Amador in Panama and Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala before the ship calls at Huatulco in Mexico and finishes in the Mexican resort of Acapulco. It costs from £1,898. The Red Sea Thomson Cruises (0870 165 0079; www.thomson.co.uk) has an escape to the warm waters of the Red Sea for a one-week Christmas cruise. Passengers join the ship in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh and sail to Port Sokhna, for excursions to Cairo. The next stop is Safaga, where customers can visit the beach resort of Hurghada or the ancient city of Luxor and the Valley of the Kings. The ship then sails to Jordan, where passengers are able to explore Petra. The cruise costs from £829, including flights. The Indian Ocean Costa Cruises (020 7940 4499; www.costacruises.co.uk) has knocked £530 off the price of its 14-night Christmas sailing around the Indian Ocean. The voyage now starts at £2,269, including flights, and departs on December 22 from Port Louis on Mauritius. The Costa Marina sails for Mahe in the Seychelles and on to Mombasa, Mayotte in the Comoro Islands, Madagascar, St Denis and Réunion Island before returning to St Louis. Indian Ocean Cruises (0800 032 7020; www.indianoceancruises.net) lets you celebrate Christmas on the ancient spice route along India's Malabar Coast. The company's two-week cruise departs Goa on December 15, spending Christmas Day in Trivandrum, India, before following the south coast to the virtually uninhabited Lakshadweep islands in the Indian Ocean and calling at Sri Lanka's capital Colombo. The sailing costs from £940, representing a discount of more than £300 on the normal price. Flights are not included. The Antipodes Holland America Line (0845 351 0557; www.hollandamerica.co.uk) allows passengers an Australasian touch to their festive celebrations with a 16-night cruise from Sydney on December 20. The ships then calls at Melbourne, Tasmania, Milford Sound, Dunedin, Christchurch, Picton, Wellington, Napier and Tauranga before finishing in Auckland. It costs from £1,479, excluding flights. Silversea Cruises (0844 770 9030; www.silversea.com) is offering a 16-night sailing of Australasia from Singapore on December 20, with calls that include Kura Kura, Darwin, Cairns, the Whitsunday Islands, and Brisbane before finishing in Sydney on January 5.

Why I love the great British pub - even when sober
Dry January: Tara Gladden is still supporting her local during her month off the grog. And yet, despite being sober, she still managed to pick a fight... British pubs are totally unique. By Tara Gladden
12:42PM GMT 11 Jan 2013
She’s holding a glass of wine. I’m holding a glass of water.
‘So how’s it all going? You know, the whole not-drinking thing?’ She cocks her head, smiles and looks expectantly at me. “Slowly.”
“But it’s…”
“Boring. Yeah, really boring.”

New York's only Welsh pub to pay $2,500 after asking for British job applicants
21 Jun 2013
In a world without alcohol, we'd have fewer murders, rapes, assaults, STDs, unwanted pregnancies, road deaths, twisted ankles, shoot-ups on submarines, tragic rock-star deaths, cases of liver cancer, student clubs, kebab shops, karaoke nights, A&E admissions, stolen street signs, Pogues songs, paparazzi scoops, random bruises, dinner parties, comedians, corner shops, love bites, stag dos, silent discos, festivals, New Year's Resolutions, friends, regrets and stories to tell our grandchildren.
Not only would year-round abstinence pack a full-force sucker punch to restaurants, theatres, working men’s clubs, opera houses, cabarets, speed-dating events, sports grounds, casinos, nightclubs, music and comedy venues – all of which rely, to a greater or lesser extent, on booze sales to remain profitable – but it would also spell the death knell for that laudable British institution: the pub.
Now I’ve lived in Germany, the States and Japan, and travelled about a fair bit, and I have yet to encounter anything remotely approximating a decent British boozer. Yes, Berliners can order beer in Maccy Ds, and New Yorkers can opt for bottomless mimosas with their weekend brunches, but they don’t generally hang out in drinking dens during the day, unless they’re dating a bar-person or self-defined as an alcoholic. For years Starbucks has been busting a gut to market itself as the ‘third place’ – a cosy, social space between work and home. It might as well have saved itself a lot of corporate bother. We’ve already got a ‘third place’: somewhere to catch up with friend, kick back by an open fire, or pick a fight with that tosser who’s looking at you funny.
For now we do, anyway.
Eighteen pubs a week are shutting their doors and/or being transformed into Sainsbury’s Locals. For this we can thank to beer tax, the credit crunch and, presumably, some of them being a bit shit. In London, where we have an embarrassment of both decent and grotty boozers, it’s hard to feel the full impact of this pub blight. But head out to the sticks (by which I mean anywhere outside of Zone 3) and it’s easy enough to find pretty villages and boring housing estates where the one local pub sits boarded up and abandoned. This is a damn shame – particularly when you’ve been on a long walk to clear your hangover, and you’re bursting for the toilet and a decent pint of cider. Which is why I’m still supporting my local, despite being perched resentfully on the old sober wagon.
Given last night’s performance, though, they might not be as grateful as you’d imagine.
I'm on my feet. My voice is raised. I might even have resorted to Angry Pointy Finger. My face hasn't been this flushed since I watched three Ryan Gosling movies back-to-back. The punters at the next table are craning their necks to look. The mates who have just joined us shuffle awkwardly. I'm almost, sort of, kind of making a scene - starting a punch-up in a brew pub.
And it's all because of Fentimans ginger beer.
Now, I'm generally more a lover than a fighter. As a middle child, I'm usually self-designated keeper of the peace, steering the conversation into safer territory whenever it threatens to founder on the rocks of dissention or stray into the shallow waters of 'Was-it-me-or-was-that-a-little-bit-racist?'
But in my defence, this time the provocation was extreme.
"You know that's alcoholic, right?" Brighton Friend asks, nodding at my glass.
I narrowly avoid choking. "You're thinking of Crabbies."
"No, look!" She grabs the bottle and jabs her finger at label. "Look, it says 'brewed'."
I snatch the bottle back. "So? That doesn't mean anything..."
"It is! It's definitely got a trace of alcohol in it. Look, I'll get my glasses and show you ."
I hold the bottle about two inches from my eyes, desperately scanning the small print. "Ha! Nothing!" I plonk the bottle down, safely out of her reach.
I'm attempting a smile, but my heart is racing. It’s like the scene in the Josh Hartnett celibacy romp 40 Days & 40 Nights where his scheming ex sabotages his attempt at abstinence with the aid of a pair of handcuffs and Hartnett's own super-sized libido. For a second there it feels like Fentimans is the scheming ex, and I'm poor Hartnett, manacled to the bar
Which is when I got shouty and indignant. "Fine! Take my last remaining pleasure away! Just get me a... a sodding water then! Or are they brewing that now too?"
My friends exchange amused glances, pat me on the shoulder, and head off to the bar to get a round of proper drinks in.
