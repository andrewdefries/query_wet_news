Britain used to win the wars it fought – so what happened in Libya?
Stalemate with Gaddafi and lack of resources in Afghanistan all point to a lack of leadership, says Con Coughlin.

Comments
As we sink ever deeper in the Libyan mire it is easy to forget that, not so long ago, we enjoyed an enviable reputation for winning wars. Whenever the British government took the painful decision to commit our Armed Forces to action in a distant land, its priority was to guarantee that the military campaign reached a victorious conclusion. Even during the darkest days of the Second World War, when German military supremacy led some of the more faint-hearted members of our political establishment to advocate a diplomatic accommodation with the Nazis, Winston Churchill resolutely stuck to his demand that nothing less than total victory would suffice. Margaret Thatcher displayed similar fortitude during the Falklands campaign when, despite stiff opposition from Cabinet “wets” and even close allies in Washington, her insistence that the Argentine invaders must be defeated was the driving force behind the islands’ liberation. So what happened? Why is it that whenever we involve ourselves in conflict, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya, it seems almost inevitable that the outcome will fall short of the expectations generated at the mission’s outset? It is not as if there has been a rapid decline in the quality of the young men and women who volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces. One need only look at the number of awards being made every year for outstanding acts of courage and bravery to see that there has been no diminution in the nation’s fighting prowess. No, the reason we appear to have lost the art of winning wars is, to a large extent, due to the failure of our politicians to provide effective leadership, and the knock-on effects that this lack of political direction and focus has on the manner in which our military campaigns are prosecuted. It is more than two hundred years since Karl von Clausewitz, the Prussian general, wrote his definitive textbook On War, in which he declared that no one in their senses should start a war “without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to do it”. And yet here we are, two months into the Nato-led military campaign against Muammar Gaddafi, and no one in Whitehall seems to have the faintest clue what our priorities are in Libya, let alone how we might accomplish them. When the RAF began bombing Gaddafi’s forces in March, its primary objective was to prevent him from massacring Benghazi’s civilian population, who had been actively encouraged in their rebellion against the regime by William Hague, the Foreign Secretary. But now the Government is pursuing an entirely different priority – namely, removing Gaddafi from power. The only problem with this new objective is that there appears to be neither the means nor the international support for it to have any chance of success. Related Articles

Libya: arrest warrants sought for Gaddafi family
16 May 2011
In the multilateral age in which we live, it is virtually impossible for any country – with the possible exception of the Americans – to achieve military success without the support of coalition partners. Many of the governments that supported the Nato mission in March did so on the basis of UN Security Council resolution 1973, which authorised the use of military force to defend Libya’s civilian population and impose a ceasefire. But most of that support, particularly among the Arab states, began to disappear the moment there was a whiff that the campaign’s ultimate objective was regime change in Tripoli, rather than humanitarian assistance. The days when we might be able to finish the job ourselves are long gone. One of our senior Army officers told me at the start of the Libyan crisis that a good tank battalion could get rid of Gaddafi and his inner circle within 24 hours. But after the recent bruising experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is no political will for such action, even assuming we had a tank battalion to spare. For one of the other great inconsistencies at the heart of the Libyan conflict is that it is being undertaken against a backdrop of the most savage defence cuts implemented for a generation. The Government’s insistence last year that it wanted to invest more resources in conflict prevention so that it could avoid becoming involved in unpopular military campaigns resulted in the overseas aid budget receiving a sharp increase, while the Armed Forces have been denuded of their stocks of tanks, ships and warplanes. But if David Cameron is serious about getting rid of Gaddafi, then the more military firepower we have at our disposal, the better. The strains caused by this contradiction no doubt explain why Dr Liam Fox, the Defence Secretary, has suffered the embarrassment of having yet another private letter to the Prime Minister leaked, on this occasion setting out his formal objection to give legal force to the Government’s plans to increase the aid budget by billions of pounds. But then, given our recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, we should hardly be surprised by the inability of our political masters to provide an effective and joined-up strategy for delivering success in Libya. Most of what went wrong in Iraq, where a brilliantly executed military campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein was ruined by the lack of adequate post-war planning, can be laid at the door of the last government. If, however, our military involvement in Afghanistan reaches a similarly inglorious conclusion, Mr Cameron will be as much to blame as New Labour. From its outset in 2006, Britain’s military contribution to the Nato effort has been hampered by two factors: woefully inadequate resources and our politicians’ failure to articulate a convincing mission statement. Five years later, we finally have the men and equipment in place to defeat the Taliban, not least because of General Sir David Richards’s insistence, when he became head of our Armed Forces last autumn, that Afghanistan should take precedence over Britain’s other military commitments. Whether that can remain the case now that the Government is more interested in overthrowing Gaddafi is a moot point. All Mr Cameron talks about these days is how many troops he can withdraw from Afghanistan, rather than how he expects them to achieve victory. Certainly, any reduction in Afghan force levels could make extra resources available for Libya – which may soon be necessary if, as looks increasingly likely, the conflict is heading towards stalemate. At present, most of the operational activity against Libya is being undertaken by the RAF and Royal Navy, which have mainly had a peripheral role in combat operations against the Taliban. But all that could change if, as seems likely, the Government decides to concentrate its resources on removing Gaddafi from power. Sir David has warned that Nato’s campaign needs to be expanded to include the regime’s infrastructure if the dictator is to be toppled. For example, Sir David wants Nato warplanes to bomb the perimeter fence around Gaddafi’s compound in Tripoli, a step which is not allowed under the current rules of engagement on the spurious grounds that the fence does not constitute a threat to Libya’s civilian population. But Sir David argues that if it were removed, this would demonstrate the regime’s vulnerability to ordinary Libyans, as well as affording rebels the opportunity to overthrow Gaddafi themselves. Another idea under active consideration is to cripple the dictator’s main oil refinery at Zawiyah, which supplies the regime’s energy needs. If the lights went out all over Tripoli, even Gaddafi might finally concede that his time was up. There’s still a chance we can win in Libya, but we need strong and effective leadership if we are to do so. Then, at long last, we can celebrate a rare success in a British military campaign.

Business Club - Use marketing to your advantage
Marketing can be used to gain better business advantage, writes Marc Nohr of Kitcatt Nohr Alexander Shaw.
3:46PM BST 28 Sep 2009
Comments
When the economy nosedives you can rely on at least one brave marketing director making the case for maintaining or even increasing investment in marketing rather than cutting back.
Is this just the Mandy Rice-Davies defence - “well, he would say that wouldn’t he” - or is there something in it?
There are plenty of examples of brands launching, maintaining or increasing their spend during recessionary periods - First Direct, Gillette Sensor, Levi’s, BMW, Gold Blend – and seeing the right kind of return on investment.
But as with all success stories you need to be careful in drawing the right conclusions. Some of these examples illustrate the competitive advantage that can be gained from innovation, creativity, improved customer service or consistency of messaging as much as they prove the case for increased advertising activity per se. Arguably we need to compare similar brands across a wide range of markets, over a long period of time.
Which is exactly what Professor Gerard J. Tellis of California’s Marshall School of Business has done. In a recent paper he surveyed a century’s worth of recessions. His conclusions are worth studying yourself but perhaps the most telling was that firms “that increased advertising during a recession experienced higher sales, market share or earnings during or after the recession”.

And he concluded that the converse was also true – namely firms that cut-back during recession impacted negatively on sales during and after recession, without necessarily impacting positively on profits.
Tellis’s study is not the only one to reach the conclusion that brands can lose share by cutting back in recessions. But for the average small or medium-sized business it takes nerve to maintain expenditure in the face of declining revenues, especially if cash is tight and there is shareholder pressure to bring costs into line.
So what’s a business to do, short of closing its eyes, crossing its fingers and hoping that boldness in the face of adversity will reap dividends over time?
Fortunately, investment in marketing is not a yes or no question. It could be that there are areas of your marketing mix which you can or should seek economies in the short-term. Whereas there may be others that would benefit from greater expenditure.
How do you tell the difference? You start to measure. When you invest in marketing, you need to make a corresponding investment in intelligence gathering. If you fail to gather data and insights – about your market, your brand, your customers, the performance of your communications – then your financial planning will have the precision of pinning a tail on a donkey.
If you can measure, over time, the performance of your marketing (both quantitative and qualitative measures) then self-evidently your decisions should be better informed.
And if your business is new and lacks historic metrics, then there’s plenty of data out there if you know where to look and who to ask (the various marketing industry bodies are a good place to start).
Zigging when others zag is not only about increasing share of voice when others go curiously silent with their advertising. It’s also about being more interesting, more relevant and more engaging than your competitors. This is a plea for investing in high standards of creative thinking and execution. But also engaging all of your colleagues in product and customer innovation.

Ten tips to safely invest in ETFs How can you tell if an exchange -traded fund is safe? Here are 10 tips for investors considering ETFs.

Comments
Look for the UCITS label
Any fund which complies with EU undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) statutes will be subject to investor protection rules, such as compulsory diversification to reduce risk. For example, no more than 5pc of these ETFs can be invested in any one share and no more than 10pc can be invested in unapproved securities.
Beware exchange-traded products
ETPs are often loosely described as ETFs but no ETP qualifies for UCITS, so may hold assets which are difficult to turn back into cash in a hurry.
Where's the beef?
Physical ETFs hold the assets on which they are based and so are less risky than synthetic ETFs which rely on financial derivatives. Ben Yearsley of Hargreaves Lansdown said: "The only ones I would consider holding are physically backed ETFs which actually own the underlying commodity. They do a far better job of tracking the underlying price than a derivative-backed ETF. Second, a derivative backed ETF doesn't reduce risk as there will be a counterparty involved."
No guarantee is worth any more than the guarantor Counterparty risk is City jargon for the danger that companies backing synthetic ETFs may fail to deliver.
Past performance is no guarantee of future returns
However, it is well worth considering. John Fletcher, of Charles Stanley stockbrokers, said: "Tracking error – that is, the degree to which the ETF price varies from the index or commodity it follows – can vary greatly between similar ETFs and this needs to be researched."

Is your fund manager lazy?
22 May 2011
Don't get caught short ETFs that aim to profit from falling prices can produce surprising results. Ben Gutteridge, a director of wealth managers Brewin Dolphin, explained: "Most are based on daily closing prices. This means a 10pc rise one day will lead to a 10pc fall in your short ETF. If we carry this on for a five-day pattern, a £100 long investment would be worth approximately £161 – that is, up 61pc. But, such is the mechanics of daily calculation that a £100 investment in a short ETF will be worth £62 – that is, down 38pc. This imperfect hedge needs to be accounted for. Also, the more volatile the referenced asset, the greater this imperfection risk becomes."
Big may be beautiful Mr Fletcher said: "One indicator of whether to invest or not is the level of assets under management (AUM) within the ETF – a low AUM may eventually result in a delisting. So we lean toward the larger funds."
Leverage is a two-edged sword Borrowing to invest – called "leveragee_SDRq – can increase losses as well as profits.
Synthetic commodity ETFs can deliver a nasty surprise Mr Gutteridge pointed out: "Unless purchasing an ETF that holds the physical commodity, investors are at the mercy of not only of the spot price but interest rates and a phenomenon known as 'roll yield'.
"In order not to receive delivery of the underlying commodity, ETFs will sell the expiring contract – known as a 'future' – and buy back into one with a longer maturity. This is not a like-for-like transaction, however, as longer maturities are usually more expensive. Each time a contract is rolled in this way, the ETF will suffer. Using financial parlance, contango is a rising futures curve with a negative roll yield and backwardation is a falling futures curve with a positive roll yield."
If in doubt, do nowt

Dry January will be tough – that’s why I must do it
Many of us worry about how much we drink – now we can join Allison Pearson in taking up the Alcohol Concern challenge
Grape expectations: 'The recommended units for a woman bear little relation to the amount of sauvignon blanc I merrily splosh into my glass,’ says Allison Pearson
By Allison Pearson
7:22PM GMT 29 Dec 2013
Comments
I am not an alcoholic, though alcoholism runs in my veins. My father drank steadily, and sometimes unsteadily – it was a bad sign if there was whisky before noon – and I feel the pull of alcohol like the tide feels the moon.
The other morning, at breakfast, the Small Boy and I were talking about the claim that Nigella Lawson smoked cannabis with her children, and he said: “You and me, Mum, we have to be careful about drugs because we’ve got addictive personalities.”
I felt a pang of pride, and then dismay. I hadn’t realised quite how many times in his 14 years I’d given him that particular lecture but give it I had, and enough times to make it stick. If I’m honest, and here we enter painful territory, I have always told my son to beware of drink because I see my father in him so clearly. In his brightness, in his blondness, but above all in the way he snaffles up sugary things like he’s feeding some inner sugar monster. Don’t worry, I tell myself when he’s polished off a packet of Jammie Dodgers after school, all boys like sweets and biscuits. Then I remember how my dad always had three sugars in his tea and how that sweet tooth – a craving for sweetness I have inherited – seems to be a part of the personality that drinks not for fun but out of some furious need.
So that’s why I’ve banged on about the dangers to a teenager who, thus far, has only had a few disgusted sips of fizz on special occasions, and pronounced it “sour” and “gross”.

Given the family history with alcohol, I suppose I should be able to tell you that I heed my own warnings. But I don’t. Like many women of my age who try to combine a family with a full-time job, I drink to relax, to put me in a better mood, to make the sharp edges of a tight schedule go fuzzy. When the children were small, the debate among my fellow mums was whether you had your first glass of white wine before you bathed the kids or whether you saved it as a reward for when the little darlings were finally in bed. “Gin o’clock” for me was that moment after the kids’ tea when the kitchen looked like a battlefield, with pizza crusts and bare Barbies strewn over a wide area; and I still had the marathon of getting a squally toddler and a five-year-old into pyjamas. I would go to the fridge and pour myself a soothing glass of white wine. If I had tonic in the house, I would make a G&T, my favourite drink. There is nothing quite like the healing sting of gin for stiffening the synapses and making another viewing of Teletubbies seem bearable.
How many shattered working mothers make alcohol part of their evening routine? For me it’s not every single night, but if I haven’t had a glass of wine by 7.30pm then I definitely feel the lack. It’s as if a vital piece of punctuation were missing in the essay of the day.
Don’t get me wrong; I’m not a heavy drinker. At least I don’t regard myself as one, though I do have a sneaky sense that the recommended units for a woman’s alcohol consumption bear very little relation to the amount of sauvignon blanc I merrily splosh into a large wine glass. If a unit is one of those dismal, stumpy little glasses you get at a school parents’ evening then I must be consuming at least twice that, and even more if I give myself a top-up, which is not unusual before I settle down in front of Downton or Strictly.
By far the worst time of the week, though, is Post-Column Night. That’s Wednesday, after I’ve spent the whole day in the office at home writing my Daily Telegraph column. Trying to produce inspired, topical prose flat-out to a deadline over nine hours, during which I scarcely permit myself a visit to the loo, means that, come Gin o’clock, I am emitting a high-pitched hum of stress. Think menopausal hornet.
I can’t wait to get downstairs and have a glass of wine. Actually, arranging for it to be administered intravenously while I type would be even better. On the rare Wednesdays when I find we haven’t got any wine in the fridge, I get very agitated, angry even. “I need a drink, goddamit!”
So that’s one reason why I am glad to have signed up for Alcohol Concern’s Dry January. Not because I think it will be easy, but because I know it will be hard. The fact that it will require a serious effort of will to swerve away from the fridge every Gin o’clock tells me that my relaxing reward has become a dependency, and dependency is the mild-mannered cousin of addiction.
Besides, although I like alcohol, alcohol really doesn’t like me very much. Not any more. It seems to be another sign of middle age. Just one glass of pinot grigio and I can guarantee my sleep will be disturbed, mind slamming open like a shutter at 3am. The next morning, I feel sluggish and slow-witted. Frankly, I can no longer afford to kill brain cells voluntarily when so many are dying of their own accord.
And beneath all this, the fear. The fear that I am a drunk in waiting. All it will take is for life to deliver one grievous blow and the slippery slope becomes the north face of the Eiger, and I won’t be able to stop myself. Just as, when I go to a party and the drinks tray is brought round, I have one more than I should, then two, then three. Because whatever pause button comes as standard issue in normal people doesn’t in me.
The great actress Ellen Burstyn once described a woman who “moves from one addiction to another. All are ways for her to not feel her feelings.” I can relate to that. Any child of an alcoholic can relate to that, which is a really, really good reason not to become one yourself.
I have tried cutting back on alcohol before, with mixed success. I found if I had enough wine and gin substitutes in the house – lemon barley water, slimline tonic with ice and elderflower – then I could kid myself I wasn’t on the wagon. I’m very good at kidding myself, and overlooking my lapses. Not drinking in company will be hard. Already, I can see the pitfalls of a dry January looming – a special college dinner on the 10th, my sister’s 50th birthday on the 20th, my daughter’s 18th on the 25th. Am I really going to drink a toast in San Pellegrino?
Well, the difference this time is that I’m under observation. I want to have a month without alcohol for physical health and for mental clarity. I want to do it to show that a predisposition to alcoholism is not the same as a fixed appointment with fate. As my son said, people with addictive personalities like us have to be careful. Wish me luck.
* One of the ways to stay committed to the Dry January challenge – to go for 31 days without drinking – is to ask your friends and family to sponsor you. Set up your sponsorship online at dryjanuary.org.uk and raise money for a good cause while you’re not drinking. The money you donate will help Alcohol Concern make a real difference and help raise awareness of the problem of alcohol misuse. For full details, visit the Alcohol Concern website

Fountains Abbey, Yorkshire
This UNESCO-listed site is home to a beautiful ruined abbey and over 300 hectares of countryside. It also features a stunning display of snowdrops, supposedly dating back to the 1800s when an aristocrat planted snowdrops to spell out his name on the banks of the river. Abbey and garden open from 10am to 5pm, every day except Fridays. Park open every day, 7am to 9pm.

Presidential Debates
If Barack Obama and John McCain can debate, why won't Gordon Brown take on David Cameron? Dr Liam Fox, shadow secretary of state for defence, attended the debate between US Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain, here he gives his account of the event and asks why British politics adopt a similar approach.
5:19PM BST 18 Oct 2008
It was a perfect autumn evening in New York for the third and final Presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama. The 700-strong audience which stood outside Hofstra University under a full moon were like a cross between a theatre audience and a sports crowd. We had just been through a scrum for tickets at a central secure location and then bussed to the hall for the debates. Security was tight – very tight. There was a tangible excitement in the air. The Obama supporters, many of them young, were heavily decorated with badges and stickers and exuded a brash (self?) confidence. The McCain supporters were more sedate and there was a feeling that their man would have to produce a bare knuckle fight to pull back up in the polls. The media swarmed around, anxious to get their vox pops ahead of the broadcast of the debate itself. Related Articles
McCain fights for political life
18 Oct 2008
We have nothing like it in Britain; it was like a cross between a party conference and election night. Eventually the doors opened and we swarmed into the cavernous hall where the air conditioning made hypothermia a distinct possibility. Then we waited. And waited. We were told not to laugh. Not to jeer. Not to applaud. Several hundred of the most enthusiastic and partisan people in America were told to remain studiously neutral. I wondered what sort of atmosphere we might expect as a result. The debate, we were told, would begin not at 9pm but 9.01 and 30 seconds precisely so that the networks could get their introductions done. Spontaneity, it seemed, was not to be the watchword of the evening. The candidates' wives took their seats in the front row and a ripple of nervous energy swept over the assembly. Then, suddenly, Senators McCain and Obama rushed on stage to a standing ovation with much whooping and cheering from their adoring fans. Engagement at last. And so it began – the jousting that would give us all a further insight into how these men would nurture the position of the world's most powerful chief executive. Yet, from the outset the structure mitigated against real momentum or fisticuffs. The debate was broken down into nine carefully-timed segments with micro-timing of each answer and counter-response rigidly enforced. I missed the freestyle encounters of the Commons and felt sorry for the constraints on the candidates whose campaign teams and lawyers had produced this debating straitjacket. John McCain began aggressively and continued in the same vein. Barack Obama remained a picture of studied calm, parrying each charge made against him. They discussed the economy, the deficit, the Vice Presidential candidates, education and energy. Each question resulted in a torrent of sound bites and counter-sound bites. Yet the resulting lack of context for each subject rendered the debate interesting but unexciting. I was surprised at how often people checked their watches. There were some flickers of real excitement such as John McCain's charge that "I'm not George Bush. If you wanted to take on George Bush you should have run four years ago," but mostly it was calm, even risk averse. The discussion of health care plans was virtually impenetrable to the outsider (and, talking to people afterwards, to many of those attending the event.) At the end, the applause for both candidates seemed strangely muted, perhaps a result of the absurd length of the campaign and the fatigue of the party troops. It had not quite produced the fireworks promised and the consensus seemed to be that while it was John McCain's best performance of the three debates, there had been no knock out blow. Yet, despite the slight sense of anticlimax I couldn't help a sense of jealousy. At least the American people had been allowed three occasions where their potential leaders had come face to face on equal terms. We are denied such an opportunity in Britain. We are told that we have Prime Minister's Questions so we need no other forum. Yet the bear pit of the House of Commons is hardly a venue for considered debate and the dynamic of Prime Ministers' Questions always favours the Prime Minister of the day. Is there any chance that next time we will be granted the courtesy given to American voters by their candidate?. Surely we should demand it? David Cameron has made clear that he is ready and up for it. Would Gordon Brown have the stomach for it? The evidence suggests not. Very recently our Prime Minister refused an invitation to engage in the gentlest of discussions with the Leader of the Opposition on the GMTV sofa. The American debate, despite its structural rigidity, had a real sense of history. This election will, after all, produce either the first African-American President or the first woman Vice President. Count yourselves lucky, voters of America. At least you get to see the goods before you buy. We in Britain are denied it by a Prime Minister who, despite all the monumental challenges we face, would rather keep us in the dark. Funny that.

David Cameron stands by his attack on Islamism David Cameron is standing by his decision to attack multiculturalism and hit back at Labour claims that he was helping the far Right. David Cameron called for a 'muscular' defence of British values Photo: AP	By Melissa Kite, Deputy Political Editor
9:00PM GMT 05 Feb 2011
Comments
An angry row broke out after Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, accused the Prime Minister of "writing propaganda" for the nationalist English Defence League by calling on Britons to be more robust in rejecting Islamist extremism. Ministers demanded that Mr Khan apologise for "smearing" the Prime Minister by linking him with the EDL, whose members demonstrated on the streets of Luton on Saturday, chanting "Muslim bombers off our streets" and holding banners aloft, some of which read "No more mosques". Baroness Warsi, the Conservative party Chairman, said: "For Sadiq Khan to smear the Prime Minister as a Right-wing extremist is outrageous and irresponsible. "Mr Khan is Labour's shadow justice secretary and ran Ed Miliband's leadership campaign. He must apologise, and Mr Miliband needs urgently to disown his colleague's baseless accusation."
The Prime Minister was also criticised by Muslim groups for pronouncing that multiculturalism had failed in Britain because it had led to segregation. Related Articles

Cameron: We'll get the deficit down – but it won't be easy
05 Feb 2011
In a major speech tackling the threat posed by Islamic extremists, the Prime Minister warned that "hands-off tolerance" of unacceptable practices by minority communities had only served to encourage extremism. He called for a "muscular" defence of British values. Speaking to a conference in Munich, Mr Cameron said that the threat of terrorism must be confronted not only though intelligence and surveillance, but by taking on the ideology of Islamist extremism at home. "Frankly, we need a lot less of the passive tolerance of recent years and much more active, muscular liberalism," the Prime Minister said. While a "passively tolerant" society allows its citizens to do what they like, so long as they do not break the law, a genuinely liberal country "believes in certain values and actively promotes them", Mr Cameron said. "Freedom of speech. Freedom of worship. Democracy. The rule of law. Equal rights, regardless of race, sex or sexuality. It says to its citizens: This is what defines us as a society. To belong here is to believe these things. "Each of us in our own countries must be unambiguous and hard-nosed about this defence of our liberty." He said it was no longer enough for the authorities simply to proscribe groups which advocate violence, or to ban foreign preachers of hate from coming to the UK. "Non-violent extremists" who disparage democracy, oppose universal human rights and promote separatism were also "part of the problem", he said, because they lure young Muslims on to the path of radicalisation which can later lead them to espouse violence. Organisations of this kind had been "showered with public money" by presenting themselves as representatives of the Muslim community while doing little to combat terrorism, Mr Cameron said. "Let's properly judge these organisations: Do they believe in universal human rights – including for women and people of other faiths? Do they believe in equality of all before the law? "Do they believe in democracy and the right of people to elect their own government? Do they encourage integration or separatism? "Fail these tests and the presumption should be not to engage with organisations. "No public money. No sharing of platforms with ministers at home. At the same time, we must stop these groups from reaching people in publicly-funded institutions – like universities and prisons." The pledge raised the prospect of ministers refusing to share platforms with Muslim spokesmen and women on grounds of extremism. A huge row was generated when senior politicians wrangled for weeks at the prospect of appearing on the BBC's Question Time with the BNP leader Nick Griffin in 2009; eventually Labour was represented on the panel by Jack Straw, then the justice secretary, and the Tories by Baroness Warsi. Mr Cameron's speech was a departure from the previously-stated views of Baroness Warsi, who recently caused controversy by speaking out against the division of Muslims into "moderates" and "extremists". The Prime Minister argued that extremism appealed to some young Muslims in the UK. Britain had been too cautious in standing up to "unacceptable views and practices" when they involved people who were not white, he said, citing forced marriage as a case in point. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of Muslim youth group the Ramadhan Foundation, said the Prime Minister had failed to tackle "the stooge of the fascists EDL and the BNP". "Singling out Muslims as he has done feeds the hysteria and paranoia about Islam and Muslims," he said. "On the day we see fascists marching in Luton we have seen no similar condemnation or leadership shown from the Government. Only when we see true action on the fascists will confidence be restored in our politics."
Dr Faisal Hanjra, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, described Mr Cameron's speech as "disappointing". "We were hoping that with the new Government, the Coalition, there would be a change of emphasis in terms of counter-terrorism and dealing with the problem at hand."
Saturday’s demonstration in Luton passed off peacefully despite fears of confrontation. Around 2,000 EDL supporters were kept apart from 1,000 counter-protesters from Unite Against Fascism. Police said there were seven arrests, most for possession of weapons and assault. Around 1,000 officers were present, costing taxpayers £800,000. Gavin Shuker, the Labour MP for Luton South, also questioned the wisdom of Mr Cameron's speech on the same day as the EDL demonstration. "On the day far-right extremists are descending on Luton, inciting tension between communities and costing the taxpayer in excess of £800,000 to keep Luton people safe, you have to ask yourself – is Cameron being unwise to attack one form of extremism when another form is out on the streets today making people in Luton feel unsafe?"
* A planning appeal will open this week to decide whether Tablighi Jamaat, a fundamentalist Islamic group, can build one of Europe’s largest mosques next to the 2012 Olympic site. Newham council turned down the proposal after moderate Muslims said it would promote separatism. David Cameron

Stars beat the dot.com kids in race for riches
By Simon English in New York
12:01AM BST 06 Sep 2001
THE film star Tom Cruise and the golfer Tiger Woods joined the ranks of the youngest and wealthiest in America this year as entertainers edged out businessmen in the race for riches. Fortune magazine's third annual survey of the 40 richest self-made Americans aged under 40 places the 39-year-old actor at number 19, with an estimated personal wealth of $251 million (£180 million). Cruise is one of six celebrities to join the elite group, which last year included only the basketball star Michael Jordan on the list of mostly internet entrepreneurs. The stock market slump and plunge in the value of many of the top technology companies has seen many of America's young business titans decline into comparative poverty. Even those entrepreneurs who did hold their own are considerably poorer. The average wealth of the 40 has dived by almost half to $935 million.

Tiger Woods, 25, scrapes into this list at number 40 with a personal fortune of merely $160 million. Last year the poorest of the 40 was worth three times that figure. Last year's list included 13 billionaires, while this year there are only five. Michael Dell, the 36-year-old whizz-kid who leads Dell Computers, remains top with a net worth of $16 billion (£11 billion). Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, remains fifth, yet his fortune has dropped from $4 billion to $1.2 billion. Jordan, at number 13 with $398 million, the rapper Sean Combs, at 22 with $231 million, and the actor Jim Carrey are among the entertainers who have shown sharper business acumen than some of those in commerce. Nicholas Stein at Fortune said they had exploited what had been a huge power shift in the industry in the past few years. "An elite cadre of celebrity athletes, actors and musicians transformed themselves from mere entertainers into powerful brands," he said. Fortune spent months analysing financial documents to come up with the list, which specifically excludes those who inherited their money. Knocking on the door of the prestigious survey is Britney Spears who, at 19, is already worth $46 million. Julia Roberts, with $138 million, is one blockbuster film away from staking her claim. USA

Telepathic computer can read your mind
Telepathy has taken a step closer to reality after British scientists developed a computer that can read your thoughts.
By Richard Alleyne, Science Correspondent
5:00PM GMT 11 Mar 2010
Comments
The system is able to decipher thought patterns and tell what people are thinking simply by scanning the brain.
The breakthrough is a step forward because it can delve into people's memories and differentiate between different recollections.
The breakthrough follows research last year by the same team who used the same technique to track a person's movements around a computer-simulated room.
The study published online in Current Biology focussed on the hippocampus, an area at the centre of the brain that plays a crucial role in short term memory.
A telepathy machine raises the prospect of a lie detector tests and could even lead to manipulations of memories such as in the film the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MInd.
In their latest experiment the researchers showed 10 volunteers three seven second films featuring different women carrying out an everyday task in a typical urban street such as posting a letter or drinking coffee from a paper cup.
The volunteers were asked to memorise what they saw and then recall each one in turn whilst inside an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanner which records brain activity by measuring changes in blood flow within the brain.
The computer algorithm then studied the electrical patterns and could tell which film the volunteer was recalling with an accuracy of about 50 per cent - which was well above chance.
Prof Eleanor Maguire, of University College London, said: "In our previous experiment we were looking at basic memories, at someone's location in an environment.
"What is more interesting is to look at 'episodic' memories – the complex, everyday memories that include much more information on where we are, what we are doing and how we feel.
"We've been able to look at brain activity for a specific episodic memory — to look at actual memory traces. We found our memories are definitely represented in the hippocampus.
"Now that we've seen where they are, we have an opportunity to understand how memories are stored and how they may change through time."
The researchers used the same scanning technique in their earlier study to work out the locations of four men as they navigated their way around a virtual reality room.
The pattern of brain activity was different for each of the four points they visited - allowing the team to work out where the men were. Science News

St Mirren and Ross County veto plans for restructuring at Scottish Premier League meeting
Plans to restructure Scottish football look to have died after St Mirren and Ross County vetoed the proposals at a Scottish Premier League meeting.

Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne emerged from talks to announce the teams had failed to secure the 11-1 majority needed to send the plans to the Scottish Football League. The proposals would have seen both league bodies merge in a 12-12-18 structure with a pyramid system below. The most controversial aspect was for the top two leagues to split into three after 22 games in a bid to generate extra revenue. St Mirren last week confirmed they were going to vote against the deal, which had been agreed in principle in January. Their chairman Stewart Gilmour refused to comment after the talks at Hampden, but Milne said: "One club in particular you would need to ask just exactly what their agenda is - St Mirren.

Reconstruction plans appear doomed

"What was on the table for everyone to consider today was back the plan, an opportunity to move Scottish football forward. "If it doesn't deliver to the extent that 10 clubs genuinely believe it will deliver, then the opportunity is there to re-look at it down the line within two to three years. "It's the status quo. The offer of changing the reconstruction rules was rejected by the two clubs, which no one can see the logic behind." Hearts managing director David Southern claimed St Mirren had rejected the offer of moving future league structure votes to a 9-3 voting system.
Southern said: "We were very close. The concession was a significant concession. All 11 clubs were led to believe the stumbling block was the 11-1 vote.
"The concession was to change the 11-1 to 9-3 so the stumbling block was removed. You now need to go and ask the club that believed that was the stumbling block and then change their mind."
He added: "I do believe that the 11-1 vote was just used as a smokescreen to protect other people's interests." Edited by Ben Bloom

Dr Sarah Wollaston MP: 'Fat and happy? Forget it. That's why I'm subjecting myself to RideLondon'
For Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, it's time to work off the mince pies and start training for RideLondon, a gruelling 100 mile bike race this August. Can weight loss really be so much harder in your fifties? The real deadly white powder in most of our lives is sugar, says Dr Sarah Wollaston MP Photo: JAY WILLIAMS By Dr Sarah Wollaston MP
3:42PM GMT 02 Jan 2014
Is it really so much harder to lose weight in your fifties? Many women used to tell me so and now the supersize chickens have come home to roost. Did my 'metabolism' suddenly change once I hit my half-century or was it more that I stopped running and started grazing? Once past a certain point the reality is that it is extraordinarily difficult to return to a 'normal' weight. Fat and happy? Forget it. Obesity is more likely to be associated with a downward spiral of low self-esteem, stress and fatigue, aggravated by junk food and drink. The real deadly white powder in most of our lives is sugar. Many women also struggle with secret drinking, especially if that becomes their anaesthetic of choice for a failing relationship, financial problems or an empty nest. Comfort and binge eating followed by crash dieting rarely leads to any improvement in body image or mood. Like any other addiction, change probably starts with some honesty; that there is more to middle age obesity than 'metabolism'. It really is all about the calories. Related Articles

Sarah Wollaston: Female MPs fear being 'derided' in Commons

It's never too late to turn it around but there are no safe short cuts; you can only lose weight if you take in less than your body uses. The calories burned through exercise are surprising low and it is not possible to exercise yourself thin; you have to reduce calorie intake too. That said, exercise really matters as it improves well-being and motivation, controlling the drive to binge. Fitness independently also reduces some of the risks from the host of medical problems which obesity brings in its wake. So why is it so difficult to just get on and do it? Too little time, too painful, too embarrassing, didn't work last time ... The trouble with overly ambitious New Year's resolutions is that they can just set you up to fail. The draft NICE guidance on obesity, expected to be published in May this year, talks of the need to make gradual changes to eating habits and physical activity, as too many changes at once can lead to an increased risk of failure. If your goal is to improve your health, even small changes in weight make a significant difference. But the advice needs to be tailored to individuals and gradual change won't suit everyone. Some people do need more of a push, like a realistic but achievable physical challenge to get them to train. I know that I do. That's why I'm taking part in RideLondon this August – as this pic shows, I've started training already for the 100 mile race on a tandem with a Middle-Aged Man in Lycra (MAMIL). Whatever the route to shifting excess weight, a positive non-blame approach is essential but honesty about intake and some of the other causes is not the same as blame. My tips for successful dieting Don't drink your calories: It's worth checking out how many calories are hidden in a large glass of wine, fruit juice or latte. Some seemingly healthy juices can pack up to 600 calories a bottle. Eat off a smaller plate and cut right down on bread and pasta. Most of all, if you are addicted to junk, have absolutely nothing in your shopping trolley or at home in your cupboards to lead you astray. Zero-tolerance approach: Like any other addiction, when you cut out sugar and alcohol expect the first week to be miserable. It doesn't have to be hell though; you can reduce the lows and improve motivation by joining a group or finding a no-nonsense training buddy. Issue yourself an ultimatum: As for my training buddy, the front of my tandem has issued an ultimatum; lose a stone or RideLondon on my own bike (all by myself). One hundred miles in August is a long way without a MAMIL; probably more painful than that long overdue change in lifestyle. Time to ditch the excuses and the calories, ramp up the exercise and see if the advice works. As for government, it's time to take the obesity epidemic far more seriously and look again at the devastating human cost of junk food and drink and of ultra-cheap alcohol. It is time for a price differential between high sugar versus low calorie alternatives and, if we want to help reverse the super sizing of Britain, to put an end to the super sizing of junk food and drink. Dr Sarah Wollaston, 51, is the Conservative MP for Totnes. She has started a training blog ahead of RideLondon in August, which records her favourite cycling routes around Devon and encourages others to add their own
