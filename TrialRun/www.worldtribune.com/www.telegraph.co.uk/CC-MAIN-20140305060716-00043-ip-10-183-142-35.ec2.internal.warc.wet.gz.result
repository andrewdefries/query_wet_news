Libor Scandal
FSA admits slow response to Libor but denies failure
The Financial Services Authority has admitted there was widespread knowledge of Libor-rigging among its employees years before it launched an investigation in 2010, but denies "major regulatory failure".

The regulator, which on Tuesday released the findings of an internal audit into its handling of the scandal, said employees "at all levels of management" were aware of "severe dislocation" in the Libor markets from summer 2007 to early 2009, years before it launched a formal investigation in 2010. The audit, which reviewed 97,000 documents, threw up "instances where information available provided some indication lowballing might be occurring" but insisted that no information available to the watchdog could have indicated that traders were manipulating the key rate for their own financial gain. It blamed its sclerotic response on preoccupation with the ongoing financial crisis and the fact that it had no formal regulatory responsibility for Libor, but stopped short of admitting to major regulatory failure. Adair Turner, FSA chairman, conceded these factors led the regulator to fall short when it came to detecting so-called lowballing, the submission of falsely low rates for Libor, a key interbank lending rate used to price financial contracts around the world. “As the financial crisis developed in 2007 to 2008, the FSA’s bank supervisors were primarily focused on ensuring they understood the prudential implications of severe market dislocation. And the FSA had no formal regulatory responsibility for the Libor submission process," he said. Related Articles

"As a result, the FSA did not respond rapidly to clues that lowballing might be occurring."
Two UK banks, RBS and Barclays, and Swiss lender UBS have been fined for rigging Libor and other benchmark rates, with others expected to settle similar charges soon. The banks were fined for manipulating Libor to make money on their derivatives contracts, or for lowballing Libor submissions to give an appearance they were having no difficulty borrowing money during the 2008 markets meltdown.

Prank video: students admit faking clip of Golden eagle snatching a toddler in Canada
Three Canadian students admit that this viral hit video of an eagle snatching a child in a Montreal park is fake.

It might, at first glance, look like one of the most startling moments of man versus nature ever caught on camera. It is, in fact, a hoax. In footage uploaded onto YouTube on Tuesday a golden eagle is seen circling above a sunlit park in Montreal while onlookers murmur their admiration in French. Twitter: BillCorbett - Baby-grabbin' eagle video = fake, says @bstiteler. Do not let Big Eagle fool you again, sheeple! http://t.co/I1LQtvFi
Suddenly the bird swoops down and seizes a child who is sitting contentedly on the grass. The eagle takes to the air but after a moment the todder falls from its talons. The minute-long film ends with the weeping child being consoled by a parent. Within hours the video, titled "Golden Eagle Snatches Kid", had garnered more than a million views on Youtube but soon armchair critics and experts alike began to express scepticism over the remarkable footage.

They seized on a moment right before the eagle gathers the child in its talons, when its shadow appears to disappear, and the strangely floating way that toddler falls after being released. Others pointed to the fact that sunny day in the film did not match Montreal's recent weather, protesting that there was no way a person could resist immediately posting the footage to the internet. Twitter: John R. Hutchinson - Hmm, some frame-by-frame analysis of eagle-vs-kid... still not sure; shadows can do funny things: http://t.co/t3jomWb7
Finally there is the issue of the bird itself - according to Kenn Kaufman, a wildlife expert, golden eagles are rarely seen in Montreal and the bird in the video appears to be some kind of falcon. "This was clearly a setup: using a falconer's bird, and probably a fake toddler for the distant scene," he said. What do you think of the eagle video? Is it real or fake?
Their suspicions proved correct when a post on the official website of Canada's National Animation and Design Centre (Centre NAD) revealed that the video was, in fact, the work of three of its students, who had used sophisticated visual effects to create the fake scene. Canada

Most dinosaurs were vegetarian, research suggests
Most dinosaurs were vegetarian rather than meat-eating beasts, research suggests.
Theropods are a group of bipedal dinosaurs colloquially known as "predatory" dinosaurs and include the iconic hunters Tyrannosaurus rex (above) and Velociraptor Photo: AFP/GETTY IMAGES	By Andy Bloxham
6:55AM GMT 21 Dec 2010
Follow While Tyrannosaurus Rex sums up the image of a dinosaur wreaking terror by ripping flesh with powerful jaws, many of its closest relatives were more content nibbling leaves. A new study of the diet of 90 species of theropod dinosaurs challenged the conventional view that nearly all theropods hunted prey, especially those closest to the ancestors of birds. Rather it showed that among the most bird-like dinosaurs known as coelurosaurs plant eating was a common way of life. Their diet may have also helped them survive and exploit new environments becoming the most successful group of dinosaurs throughout the Cretaceous Period, 145-65 million years ago. Dr Lindsay Zanno of the Chicago Field Museum said: "Most theropods are clearly adapted to a predatory lifestyle, but somewhere on the line to birds, predatory dinosaurs went soft."

Theropods are a group of bipedal dinosaurs colloquially known as "predatory" dinosaurs and include the iconic hunters Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor. Among theropod dinosaurs, all modern birds and several groups of their closest extinct relatives belong to a subgroup known as Coelurosauria. Most were feathered and most intelligent dinosaurs and those with the smallest body sizes also belong to this group. However researchers have been only left with fossilized bones and teeth to work with and so had to deduce their diets. For example the bone-crunching teeth and jaws of Tyrannosaurus rex were the tools of a megapredator or that the tooth batteries of Triceratops were used for shearing plant material. However many coelurosaurian dinosaurs have more ambiguous adaptations such as peg-like teeth at the front of the mouth or no teeth at all so determining their diet has been a challenge. Dr Zanno added: "These oddball dinosaurs have been the subject of much speculation but until now, we have not had a reliable way to choose between competing theories as to what they ate."
But a small number of fossilized dinosaur dung, stomach contents, tooth marks, the presence of stones within the stomach that serve as a gastric mill for digesting vegetation have been found along with a number of species. And two dinosaur species preserved locked in the throes of combat have been found to cast light on the mystery of what dinosaurs ate. The researchers found almost two dozen anatomical features statistically linked to direct evidence of herbivory including a toothless beak. "Once we linked certain adaptations with direct evidence of diet, we looked to see which other theropod species had the same traits. Then we could say who was likely a plant eater and who was not." Applying their data on diet, the researchers found that 44 theropod species distributed across six major lineages were eating plants and that the ancestor to most feathered dinosaurs and modern birds had probably already lost its appetite for flesh alone. Because plant eating was found to be so widespread in Coelurosauria, the hypercarnivorous habits of T. rex and other meat eating coelurosaurs like Velociraptor should be viewed "more as the exception than the rule." Besides identifying diet, the researchers analyzed whether different groups of coelurosaurs followed the same evolutionary pathways toward an herbivorous diet. They found that over time, species lost their flesh-rending teeth, developing strange tooth types such as peg, wedge, and leaf-shaped teeth, and ultimately, some lost most or all of their teeth altogether and replaced them with a bird-like beak. The beaks then continued to evolve into a myriad of forms and help support a high degree of dietary diversity in modern birds. One theory why they were so successful was that the break up of continents and origin of new habitat opened up new dietary niches for coelurosaurs to explore. Dr Zanno said: "The ability to eat plant materials may have played a pivotal role in allowing coelurosaurian dinosaurs to achieve such remarkable species diversity. "But more study is needed to understand what role dietary shifts may play in evolutionary processes." Because ceolurosaurian dinosaurs include the closest extinct relatives of birds, understanding their biology is also extremely important to understanding how, why, and under what conditions birds evolved and first took flight. "We don't know what drove the ancestors to birds to take flight," she says, "seeking food in the trees is just one of many possibilities." Using statistical analysis to find correlations between physical traits and diet could offer a new window as to how evolution works. "Being able to establish diet in extinct animals with confidence will allow us to start tackling even broader questions, such as whether animals tend to increase in body and diversity when they evolve herbivory." The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dinosaurs
