Paul Simon: 'God's not into pop - he likes gospel'
At 69, Paul Simon is about to release a new album full of big issues and jokes, he tells Neil McCormick
.

In an unassuming rehearsal room in a small Connecticut town, Paul Simon sits facing into a circle of a dozen musicians, sound technicians and roadies, issuing soft-spoken instructions. “It’s just on the verge of being really great,” he says, thick, strong arms resting on a guitar perched across his midriff as he makes detailed comments regarding parts his band should play. “I like the talking drum, but maybe it should talk a little less.” The groove starts up again, and Simon joins in. With his pale, round face, thin flyaway hair pasted across a balding pate, he looks all of his 69 years, but he sings with a soft, pure tone undiminished by age, and as the music gathers momentum, a big grin spreads, and the years fall away. “I love to make music,” Simon tells me later. “I love it when the rhythm is right, when the sound is really what I want, when the parts fit together so intimately, it feels natural and you give yourself over to the pulse and excitement.” He is, he admits, a demanding band leader. “If it’s not quite right, it really drives me crazy. Your ear goes to the irritant. The main villain is usually clutter. It takes a lot of work to get it up to a point where it’s wrong.” His fastidiousness is impressive, but I don’t suppose you get to be one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time without paying attention to detail. “I really think of myself as a songwriter- singer, not a singer-songwriter,” says Simon. “This is all I’ve really done my whole life, write songs, but there’s still plenty to learn, even if, at this point, I’m mostly teaching myself.” Simon is preparing for the release of his first album in five years, So Beautiful or So What (out in the UK on June 13). It’s an album that seems to bring together all kinds of strands of his musical life, the African grooves of Graceland shaded with his constant devotion to American blues, doo-wop and rock’n’roll underpinning the acoustic guitars, flowing melodies, orchestrations and beautiful harmonies of classic Simon & Garfunkel, all wrapped around the kind of philosophical, self-questioning, conversational lyrics that have been his hallmark since the solo Seventies classics such as Still Crazy After All These Years.

“One of the things people have attached to me is that I’m always changing, but I think I’m just evolving, shedding some things and taking others along with me. There are things that I’ve taken from the first songs that I wrote when I was 15. I like doo-wop. I stick it in all the time. I like that finger picking I learned when I lived in England. I can’t play much blues at all, but the little bit I play is slap and pushed strings that all comes from Davey Graham and Bert Jansch. A lot of things I learned about rhythm from African musicians were useful and made sense to me.” One of the things, he dropped, of course, was his partnership with Art Garfunkel, although the duo still reunite for occasional gigs. “It’s a pleasure to sing with Artie, but I don’t like it when it overwhelms what I’m doing now. We only made five albums, so when we go out we can do maybe 22 songs, and after that you’re getting into songs that you really don’t want to sing. I Am A Rock is a little on the young side. Some of them, I couldn’t be happier with. Sound of Silence is beautiful when I sing it with him, The Boxer is great, Bridge Over Troubled Water I never sing without him, so that is pleasurable, but it’s what I did 40 years ago. I don’t like the inference that what I did then is the definition of who I am.” The themes of Simon’s new album are typically grand (the value of love in hard times, the question of whether existence is just a cosmic joke, the very meaning of life) but the way they are addressed is light and spry, offering questions rather than answers, and peppered with jokes. There are a lot of appearances by God, although He is not conjured up as a particularly benign deity. Love Is the Eternal Sacred Light collapses the whole history of the universe into a couple of quite extraordinary verses, but has God commenting, “Big bang, that’s a joke I made up once when I had eons to kill”. Simon leaves God driving down a highway in an American car, flicking through radio stations for something he can bear to listen to. “God’s not into pop music,” laughs Simon. “He likes the gospel shows.” Simon concedes that “this type of metaphysical or spiritual thinking is a part of what goes on when I wander around”. Simon rose to prominence when the first great wave of post-Dylan singer-songwriters were seen as spiritual seekers, poetic voices of their generation’s higher aspirations. With his soft-spoken manner and thoughtful aura of Jewish New York intellectual, Simon seems the definition of a musical sage, yet shrugs off the notion of imparting wisdom. “When I write these songs, I don’t know what they are when I begin them. My criterion is truth. Is that what I think? Is that what I believe? It doesn’t have to be incredibly insightful, it just can’t be a lie. I’m not even crazy about making a point. I think that’s why it takes me longer now to write, because I see both sides. Most of the time I find it really interesting.” It is odd to find this most eloquent and considered of wordsmiths admitting that lyrics aren’t his songwriting priority. “It’s easier to talk about the words, but my joy out of this is the music. The words are hard. If I think something is really poorly said, I won’t stay with it, but if I think the lyric is okay, I’ll let it go. I feel like a kid let out of school. 'Alright, see you, bye!’ ” Simon lives a quiet life in Connecticut, an hour’s train ride from Manhattan but, by his own admission, cut off from the city’s energy. Married (for the third time) to singer-songwriter Edie Brickell, they have three children, and can sometimes perform together at school events, singing the Everly Brother’s All I Have to Do Is Dream (a song on which the young Simon and Garfunkel learned their harmonic trade). “It’s beautiful, our blend, I like to sing with her.” He has also written and played with his 38-year-old son Harper (from his first marriage), appearing on his acclaimed 2009 debut album. His demeanour suggests domestic contentment. At 69, with a young family, he doesn’t feel old, but hopes he will “write into old age”. He has a sense that the first generation of Sixties singer-songwriters (Dylan, Cohen, Neil Young) are on “a new frontier”, a place where songwriters have never ventured before. “My desire is just to see how far I can go. Really old age is such a foreign country. Hopefully, I’ll be able to speak from that point, and bring pleasure to people with what I observe. Although what I observe might be harsh. It might mean writing songs saying, 'What can I tell you? It stinks.’ So we’ll see. What’s the other choice? Go away? Be quiet? This is what I am, this is what I do. I make up songs and try to make them interesting. Stand back and let me get on with it.” Buy Paul Simon Tickets from Telegraph Tickets Rock and Pop Features

Ed Davey: Climate change deniers are 'crackpots'
Climate change sceptics are "crackpots and conspiracy theorists", the Energy Secretary has said. Eggborough Power Station, a coal fired plant near Selby Photo: PA	By Peter Dominiczak

In one of his strongest attacks yet on groups that question whether climate change is caused by human activity, Ed Davey warned that they are seeking “to create doubt where there is certainty”. “Of course there will always be those with a vested interest in the status quo,” Mr Davey said during a speech in Brussels. "Who seek to create doubt where there is certainty. And you will always get crackpots and conspiracy theorists who will deny they have a nose on their face if it suits them. “But the truth is this: while forecasts of the future rate at which the world will warm differ, and while many accept we will see periods when warming temporarily plateaus, all the scientific evidence is in one direction.”
Mr Davey warned that the debate over climate change has “long moved on”. Related Articles

“It’s about how you reduce emissions, not whether you must reduce emissions,” he said. Earlier this month Mr Davey attacked “destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism” about climate change, and criticised parts of the media for the way they report that scepticism. In his speech to businessmen in Europe the Liberal Democrat minister added: “And climate change’s long-term impact on the global economy? “Well, we can be sure it will make current economic troubles look mild in comparison. “So if you meet in your boardrooms people who still doubt the evidence, ask them how they normally assess risk. “And how they normally act on the evidence and presence of risk. For on the basis of any normal risk assessment – weighing probability against impact, weighing the cost of acting against the costs of inaction – taking a gamble on climate change wouldn’t be just incredibly stupid, it would have you locked up in jail for corporate negligence.”
Mr Davey said the Goverment supported a strong overall target for the EU to cut its emissions 50 per cent by 2030 if a global deal on tackling climate change is agreed, and 40 per cent if not. But he said the UK opposed any new renewables target for 2030 as "inflexible and unnecessary", although he insisted the coalition remained "very pro-renewables". "I see renewable energy having a long and prosperous future in the UK and across Europe way beyond 2020, and in fact well beyond 2030. "Yet renewables aren't the only way to decarbonise energy - from energy efficiency to new nuclear, from carbon capture and storage to renewable heat, there is strength and sense in a diverse, mixed energy strategy. Renewables are part of the solution, but not the whole solution. "Countries should be free to pick the energy mix they prefer, and not be penalised for the choices they make - including on whether they choose nuclear to deliver their emissions reductions," he said. Some Conservative MPs say that the most important change required in energy policy is to allow more “fracking”, the extraction of shale gas from the earth. Shale gas has transformed the energy market in the US, reducing American dependency on imported oil and gas, and some MPs say Britain could follow suit. IGas, a company licensed to explore for shale gas in northern England, has claimed that reserves in the area are much larger than previously thought. The company said there may be up to 170 trillion cubic feet of gas in the area. That is almost 20 times more than previously thought, and equal to more than 50 years of the UK’s current annual gas consumption. Read the latest news from Westminster at telegraph.co.uk/politics

New treatment for prostate cancer gives 'perfect results' for nine in ten men: research
A new treatment for prostate cancer can rid the disease from nine in ten men without debilitating side effects, a study has found, leading to new hope for tens of thousands of men.
By Rebecca Smith, Medical Editor
10:00PM BST 16 Apr 2012
Comments
It is hoped the new treatment, which involves heating only the tumours with a highly focused ultrasound, will mean men can be treated without an overnight stay in hospital and avoiding the distressing side effects associated with current therapies. A study has found that focal HIFU, high-intensity focused ultrasound, provides the 'perfect' outcome of no major side effects and free of cancer 12 months after treatment, in nine out of ten cases. Traditional surgery or radiotherapy can only provide the perfect outcome in half of cases currently. Experts have said the results are 'very encouraging' and were a 'paradigm' shift in treatment of the disease. It is hoped that large scale trials can now begin so the treatment could be offered routinely on the NHS within five years. Related Articles

NHS's disservice to those with prostate cancer
16 Dec 2007
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will say in new guidance next week that the treatment is safe and effective and larger scale trials should go ahead. A larger trial is already recruiting patients and men interested in the treatment should speak to their cancer doctor or GP about being referrred, experts said. Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men with more than 37,000 diagnoses each year approximately 10,000 deaths. Current treatments include surgery to remove the whole prostate or radiotherapy. Both of which can effectively treat the cancer but often cause side effects such as incontinence and impotence. However in many men prostate cancer will not progress to a life threatening disease meaning that radical treatment risks side effects unnecessarily. For this reason, research is now focused on reducing side effects. Focal HIFU involves careful selection of tumours, as small as a grain of rice, within the prostate gland and targeting them with highly focused ultrasound to heat them and destroy them. The advantage over previous HIFU and other treatments is that damage to surrounding tissue is minimised, meaning there are far fewer side effects. In the study published in the journal Lancet Oncology, 41 men were treated with focal HIFU. After 12 months, none were incontinent and one in ten suffered impotence. The majority, 95 per cent, were free of cancer after 12 months. Dr Hashim Ahmed, who led the study at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust andUniversity College London, said: “This changes the paradigm. By focusing just on the areas of cancer we reduce the collateral damage to surrounding tissue. "Our results are very encouraging. We’re optimistic that men diagnosed with prostate cancer may soon be able to undergo a day case surgical procedure, which can be safely repeated once or twice, to treat their condition with very few side-effects. That could mean a significant improvement in their quality of life. “This study provides the proof-of-concept we need to develop a much larger trial to look at whether focal therapy is as effective as the current standard treatment in protecting the health of the men treated for prostate cancer in the medium and long term.”
He said after Nice guidance is issued next week, he expected other doctors to consider using the treatment. He said: "These results will encourage more physicians to look at it more carefully. "If men are interested in this concept they should speak to their cancer doctror or their GP. "The next step is a large scale randomised controlled trial. This needs to be evaluated in a timly way so men can benefit." The research programme is led by Professor Mark Emberton, of UCL and UCLH. He said: “Focal therapy offers harm reduction – it is a strategy that attempts to redress the balance of harms and benefits by offering men who place high utility on genito-urinary function an alternative to standard care. "In fact, the concept is not new - tissue preserving strategies have been used successfully in all other solid organ cancers such as breast cancer by offering women a lumpectomy rather than mastectomy.”
Professor Gillies McKenna, director of the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology and Biology, said: "Clinical trials, like this one supported by the MRC, are a fantastic tool for telling us whether experimental new treatments are likely to be effective in the clinic. "If these promising results can be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial, focal therapy could soon become a reasonable treatment choice for prostate cancer alongside other proven effective therapies.”
The research was funded by the MRC, the Pelican Cancer Foundation and St Peter’s Trust. Jacqui Graves, Interim Head of Healthcare at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “We welcome any research that shows early signs of improving the outcomes of treatment for prostate cancer patients. "Significant reduction in the likelihood of common side effects, such as incontinence, will enable men to recover better and go on to lead good quality lives. We hope that a larger trial will be supported to ensure that the UK achieves the best outcomes for men affected by prostate cancer.”
Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity said: “We welcome the development of any prostate cancer treatment which limits the possibility of damaging side effects such as incontinence and impotence. These early results certainly indicate that focal HIFU has the potential to achieve this in the future. “However, we need to remember that this treatment was given to fewer than 50 men, without follow up over a sustained period of time. We look forward to the results of further trials, which we hope will provide a clearer idea of whether this treatment can control cancer in the long term whilst ridding men of the fear that treating their cancer might mean losing their quality of life.”

Heathrow Terminal 5: 'It was a shambles as soon as doors opened'
By Gordon Rayner, Chief Reporter
11:31PM GMT 28 Mar 2008
British Airways was warned by its own staff that the move to Terminal 5 would be a fiasco because they had not been given sufficient training, it was claimed yesterday.
There were allegations that senior executives had been urged to put back the opening date, and managers were accused of being "complacent" about the possibility of major problems.
Despite months of preparations for the opening of the £4.3?billion facility, during which BA staff supposedly tested the terminal's systems to destruction, such basic and foreseeable problems as workers having trouble parking and getting through security led to a catastrophic failure of the baggage handling system.
Baggage handlers, in particular, were woefully under-prepared for the job in hand, as they were not sufficiently familiar with their new working practices or with the geography of Terminal 5 to be able to work at full tilt.
One baggage handler said yesterday: "It turned into a shambles the moment the doors opened. The staff would blame the lack of training and essential support that was promised. During the inadequate training days prior to the opening, any staff questions were bounced back with 'I don't know' and 'It will be clear on the day'."

Heathrow Terminal 5: BA apologises for chaos
28 Mar 2008
The anonymous worker, speaking to the BBC, added: "Staff signage is non-existent and, quite frankly, how are we expected to help customers if we are not helped first?"
Another member of Heathrow staff suggested there were too few baggage handlers to deal with the 12,000 bags per hour which can be processed by the automated baggage transfer system.
"We knew it wasn't going to work," the worker said. "It shouldn't have opened. The computers are too quick for the people - you have to have a human at the other end unloading bags."
Although Heathrow's Spanish-owned operator, BAA, was partly to blame for some of Thursday's early glitches, such as problems with a staff car park, BA's own press office said "staff familiarisation" problems had been partly to blame for the meltdown.
One industry source said: "Both sets of management at BA and BAA have been incredibly complacent about T5. You have got to put your heart and soul into a project like this and they haven't."
The airline's chief executive, Willie Walsh, said: "I am accepting responsibility for the mistakes we made. If people want someone to point the finger at then they can point it at me. Our performance was not good enough."
Although Mr Walsh, who has huge support from the City after turning around BA's fortunes by dramatically cutting costs, is unlikely to be forced out of his job at this stage, he has a tough month ahead.
He admitted yesterday that the planned transfer of all long-haul services from Terminal 4 into Terminal 5 next month was now "under review" and BA faces another test next week with the implementation of the European Union's "open skies" policy, which will undermine BA's dominance at Heathrow by allowing many more airlines to operate services to the United States.
David Wilshire, a Conservative MP whose Spelthorne constituency includes Heathrow, and who sits on the parliamentary transport committee, said it was too early to say whether Mr Walsh should go.
"This has been an utter disaster but it still isn't clear exactly who is to blame," said Mr Wilshire. "We keep hearing stories about car parking problems, lifts not working, and security clearance logjams - all of which are BAA's fault - so I think we have to wait to find out whether Mr Walsh is being a gentleman by accepting the blame or whether it really was his fault."

The £40 million clean up of St Paul’s Cathedral Wren’s masterpiece, which is 300 years old, has been restored to its full glory, finds Iain Hollingshead . Link to this video
By Iain Hollingshead
7:00AM BST 21 Jun 2011
Comments
“The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.”
One can see what the author of the Acts of the Apostles was getting at, but perhaps he’d change his tune if he visited St Paul’s today. In a service this morning attended by the Queen the cathedral is celebrating not only its 300th anniversary, but also the fact that, for the first time in 15 years, it is entirely free from scaffolding.
The cathedral’s restoration – the first comprehensive works, both inside and out, in its illustrious history – cost £40 million and has taken almost half as long as it did Wren to design and build it. The result, however, is nigh-on miraculous. Inside the light floods in from the heavens, falling on freshly scrubbed carvings and sculptures. The Portland stone exterior gleams once more; the ravages of three centuries of pollution, wind and rain a distant memory. Even the office workers lunching on the steps facing Fleet Street take occasional admiring glances at the newly naked west front.
“I used to think it was rather more like a railway station than a great cathedral,” says Martin Stancliffe, the wonderfully titled Surveyor to the Fabric, who has overseen the project. “It was very dirty, very unkempt. And that made it a very gloomy, very disappointing building to work with. I think it’s not unfair to say it has been a transformation.”
Transforming the “temple” that has witnessed the funerals of Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Churchill, the peace services for the end of both world wars, and the marriage of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, has certainly required many hands. And perhaps most hands-on of these are the stonemasons, all of whom have been invited to today’s service. If anyone deserves to celebrate the end of the cathedral’s makeover – perhaps with a reading from Psalm 84, “How lovely is your dwelling place” – it is they.
When the Telegraph visited last week Gareth Shiels was sitting astride one remaining bar of scaffolding, “pointing” the final bits of the north wall. Pointing involves cutting out the cement joints where water has entered, and replacing them. More than 150,000 blocks have been restored in this way. How long has Shiels been doing this? “Long enough,” he answers (it turns out he’s been there since 2006). Mark Fosh, who spent three years cleaning almost one million cubic feet of stone, is similarly relieved it’s all over. “It was like being a chimpanzee at the zoo,” he jokes, rocking backwards and forwards to display his technique with a hosepipe.
The pressure had to be kept low so as not to damage the stonework. Lichen and moss build-up was widespread. Some carbon and soot deposits had to be chiselled out by hand. The south side of the cathedral, nearest the various power stations, was the worst (ironically, Wren’s rebuilding of St Paul’s after the Great Fire, the fourth cathedral on the Ludgate Hill site since 604AD, was financed by a tax on coal imports).
Not all the work, however, was mundane. Stancliffe was puzzled by an alarming horizontal crack that went right through the middle of the Thornhill dome. Eventually he concluded that it was the result of a high explosive bomb dropped on the north transept during the Second World War, the blast lifting the entire dome for a millisecond or two.
The stonemasons’ work also involved the reconstruction of the west steps and the re-covering of all the external cornices. Michael Crocker, a recently qualified apprentice, describes enthusiastically how he spent four weeks in the workshop under the cathedral renovating a balustrade that was on the verge of falling 30-odd feet to the ground. Some 25 balustrades were renovated this way. A lot of the work, however, had to be carried out in situ, high above the London skyline.
In the dome they restored a rusty structural chain that had existed since Wren’s time. Slightly lower, facing north, the statue of St Philip, which was removed 20 years ago when it became unsafe, is back in his rightful place, keeping a watchful eye on the London Stock Exchange. Up here the attention to detail is remarkable. St Philip’s back might be adorned with an ugly lightning conductor, but such practicalities aside, the cherubs at an altitude rarely glimpsed by the public are still carved with intimate intricacy. The cleaning process has revealed previously concealed details such as a solitary tear on the face of a cherub. The high-level swags show exquisite pomegranates and apricots. Today’s stonemasons are full of admiration for their predecessors – and, it has to be said, jealousy. As well as finding marbles in the stonework (for spacing, presumably), oyster shells (a common food in the 18th century) and one intact clay pipe, they also regularly came across initials, or Masons’ Marks, carved into the stonework. “We wanted to carve our own initials but were not allowed,” says Fosh.
No matter. They should take inspiration from the inscription on Wren’s tomb: “If you seek his monument, look around you.”
Today St Paul’s again holds its own on the City skyline, a reminder of matters spirtual among the towers of Mammon. “It probably looks better than at any time since its completion in 1711,” says Stancliffe. “The driving intention of the whole project has been how to make the cathedral act as the real missionary for the church – to make the building speak as clearly and as openly as it can to everybody who comes through the door.”
Inside those doors the cathedral’s annual two million visitors will find the Whispering Gallery repainted, every pipe of the organ which Mendelssohn once played cleaned, the walls washed several shades lighter and all six million pieces of a mosaic individually cleaned with cotton buds and de-ionised water.
They might even find God. “It causes everyone to pause and look around them with wonder,” says Stancliffe. “It makes all the services here much more glorious than they were before.”

Roddy Forsyth: Craig Whyte and Rangers paying heavy price for damage done by Sir David Murray
The familiar sound which greets each fresh piece of bad news about Rangers does not come solely from gleeful Celtic fans relishing the torments of their ancient adversaries. That cackling is also the clamour of flocks of chickens flying home to roost at Ibrox. Going with the Flo: one only has to utter the name of Tore Andre Flo to conjure the limits of Rangers's folly in the transfer market Photo: REUTERS	By Roddy Forsyth
11:00PM BST 15 Sep 2011
Comments
The tax tribunal that could tip Rangers into insolvency is the legacy of an era of such profligacy that it makes the eyes water to consider how money was once lavished on the club in a vain – and the word is employed here in both its meanings – attempt to conquer Europe. No manager of a Scottish club has ever come close to Dick Advocaat’s spending on players and, as matters stand, none ever will. Advocaat laid out £80 million on players who made no impact whatsoever in European competition. Even worse, their brief period of domestic domination came to a crunching end when Martin O’Neill arrived at Celtic in 2000. The Dutchman quit as Rangers manager the following season, although his contract had two years left to run. From time to time he attempts to rewrite history, as when he said last year: “If I have a debt of £60 million but the players are worth £150 million, then I don’t have a debt – it’s like buying a house.” You got it in one there, Dick. Look what happened to people who bet large on that particular commodity. As for Rangers, we only have to utter the name of Tore Andre Flo to conjure the limits of the club’s folly in the transfer market. Related Articles

Interesting to note that the hapless Norwegian cost the club 20 per cent of £60 million – and would have been worth what, by Advocaat’s standards or anyone else’s? However, it is not the oddly insecure and bombastic Dutch manager who compels our attention so much as the philosophy he represented. Sir David Murray’s tenure at Ibrox is encapsulated in his boast that if Celtic spent £5, he would outlay £10 and – as was pointed out in these pages when Craig Whyte assumed control of the club – Murray’s cash did bring in almost exactly twice as many trophies as Celtic over the period of his ownership. The fatal flaw in the calculation – and it is debatable how much was ever calculated – is that the honours were all domestic, a native Scottish currency that was rapidly declining in value compared to the prestige and riches to be acquired from success in the Premier League and Champions League. Even in that respect, Rangers have simply reaped what once they sowed. When David Holmes, then chairman at Ibrox, appointed Graeme Souness as manager in 1986, he unleashed wage inflation in Scotland. For a while, all the auguries were golden – at least for Rangers. With English clubs banned from Europe after the Heysel disaster, Souness pillaged the England international side for players. Ibrox had been reconstructed – largely through funds made available by Rangers Pools – in response to the 1971 Disaster and was well ahead of the game when the Taylor Report into safety at football grounds saddled almost every other club in Britain with massive bills for rebuilding. Such an immense outlay had to be clawed back somehow and, with shining new arenas projecting the image of a reformed and wholly modern sport, the Premier League was born. That, together with the unfeasibly large salaries generated by the Bosman case, meant that any Scottish club trying to compete in like style over the longer run was bound to be throttled by debt. Very few foresaw the outcome, yet the scenario had already been played out in Scotland itself. Unable to compete with Rangers on salaries or transfer fees, Aberdeen and Dundee United declined sharply from their 1980s prosperity and competitiveness. Hearts were double victims because they did, for a brief spell, try to achieve some sort of parity in spending, only to acquire a millstone of debt that exists to this day and is currently borne by Vladimir Romanov with the help of his banking interests. However, Celtic – deeply scarred by the events of 1994 when they came within minutes of bankruptcy – did learn a traumatic lesson. Although their trophy cabinet was replenished much less frequently than its Ibrox equivalent, they can bring another perspective to bear on Murray’s now notorious pronouncement. For every £1 of Celtic debt, Rangers have run up £25 – and that is not counting the worst case scenario of an adverse verdict in the HMRC tax tribunal, which could take the Old Firm debt ratio up to 1:120. As for Whyte, nobody knows how he has made his money – because he is remarkably secretive about its provenance – or how much he is worth or what his business plan promises, other than the reduction of salaries and an increased dependence on the notoriously unreliable commodity of young players. Perhaps he will have Rangers declared insolvent – when we spoke on Monday he did not refute the suggestion that the notion must have its attractions – and, if so, it is very likely that the club will endure a welter of recriminations that will make the current publicity look like a favourable advertisement. If it does come to that, though – and whatever responsibility or culpability falls upon Whyte – the serious damage was done back in the days of Advocaat, when the manager and the owner of Rangers revelled in their ability to outspend their local rivals. And – mea culpa – the media did not urge restraint because every big transfer headline sold newspapers and satellite TV subscriptions. Plus the fact, it made Scottish football look forceful, attractive and wealthy. What price that happening again? What price indeed? The day David Francey got a real mouthful
Sad as I was to learn of the passing of my old colleague, David Francey, there was a certain aptness to hearing the news while in Madrid. David’s greatest feats were accomplished on the road – he covered all three Scottish successes in European competition – Celtic in Lisbon in 1967, Rangers in Barcelona in 1972 and Aberdeen in Gothenburg in 1983 – and his modulated, old-style Scottish accent was familiar to listeners elsewhere in the UK. Mind you, it was David’s turn to get a mouthful – quite literally – when Celtic played a game in Budapest in the 1970s. Francey was installed in front of the stand with the veteran newspaperman, John Blair, later to become press officer for the Scottish Football Association. As Francey was in full flow, a mighty clearance was booted straight at him. He was working with the old-fashioned metal lip microphone (still in use) and took the full force of ball and mike in the face. As David fell backwards, dazed and disoriented, Blair gamely attempted to offer a description of the action, but was soon forced to admit that it was an acquired skill that he lacked. Happily, Francey was able to resume normal service, albeit with a swollen and bleeding lip. After the match he deserved the opportunity to retire to his hotel room to “debrief and relax” – a Francey-esque euphemism for the opportunity to uncork the miniatures of whisky he effortlessly charmed air stewardesses into slipping into his cabin bag. What are your favourite memories of David Francey?
