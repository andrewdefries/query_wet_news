Antiviral, review
The excellent debut feature, Antiviral, by David Cronenberg's son Brandon has a level of craft you rarely expect from a first-timer, says Tim Robey. 4
Caleb Landry Jones as Syd March and Malclom McDowell as Dr. Abendroth By Tim Robey

15 cert, 103 min. Dir Brandon Cronenberg starring Caleb Landry Jones, Sarah Gadon, Malcolm McDowell
David Cronenberg may have an unlikely competitor in the field of making your skin crawl, if the excellent debut feature by his son Brandon is anything to go by. Antiviral, an eye-widening delve into conceptual science fiction, has the gruesome verve of Cronenberg Sr’s early work, and morbidity to match. It won’t do to shrug it off as a jejune clone of dad’s low-budget body-horror pictures (Shivers, Rabid), because there’s real muscle in its ideas, a potent kind of satirical despair, and a level of craft you rarely expect from a first-timer.
Celebrity obsession has tipped over the edge in this chilly vision of the near-future, where biotech firms compete to harvest stars’ ailments – cold sores, STDs, even fatal viruses – and pass them on to paying fans. Syd March (Caleb Landry Jones) is a technician for The Lucas Clinic, whose prize asset is a cover girl called Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon), an icily perfect blonde whose blood Syd regularly collects for this thoroughly icky purpose. Syd is embezzling within the company by secretly injecting himself with some of this “product” and selling his own newly infected tissue on the black market, but he goes too far when one especially virulent bug kills Hannah off.
Imagine a poutier, even frecklier Eddie Redmayne, and you’re halfway to Jones’s alien looks, which Cronenberg isolates against yards of white wall for effect. The movie is more thinkpiece than thriller, and the plot sometimes coasts a little, but it has a horrific Orwellian suggestiveness and the coldly arresting style to back it up. Like all the best science fiction, it speaks directly to our age and feels like a hideous warning: if this film’s fixation on celebrity bodies disgusts, it is merely taking its cue from the likes of The National Enquirer and its ilk.
It’s also proof that there’s room for more than one brainy provocateur in the Cronenberg gene-pool. Related Articles

Chelsea manager Rafael Benitez hits out over Marco Materazzi's 'lies'
Rafael Benítez has angrily dismissed criticism of his management style from Marco Materazzi, branding the Italian World Cup-winner a “liar” and a troublemaker. By Paul Kelso, Chief Sports Reporter
8:29PM GMT 22 Jan 2013
Comments
The defender, best known for provoking Zinedine Zidane into the fateful butt in the 2006 World Cup final, has been a persistent critic of Benítez since the pair worked together briefly at Internazionale. Materazzi repeated some of his criticism in an interview with France Football magazine this week, describing playing under Benítez as like “being back at school”. “He [Benítez] is not exactly my ideal coach. If I were in charge of a club, I would never entrust him with my team,” Materazzi said. “What I did not like about him was the way he presented himself to the team. Great coaches like Marcello Lippi and Jose Mourinho use unwritten rules, but Benitez wanted to write 10 to 12 things down. It was like we were back to school or had to follow traffic rules.”
Materazzi, who was a member of Inter’s 2010 European Cup-winning team under Mourinho, has also claimed that Benitez was approached for the Internazionale job while the Portuguese was still in charge at the San Siro. He claims to have told Mourinho, “please don’t leave me with Benítez”. He also accuses Benítez of making him remove pictures of Mourinho and Lippi from his locker, which the Chelsea manager denies.

It took only the mention of Materazzi’s name at Chelsea’s training ground on Tuesday for Benítez to respond forcefully. “He’s lying. He’s lying. He’s lying, just lying. Everything he has said is a lie. Simple. "Everything about what he talks about: about me, the two things he said about me. About when he was talking to Mourinho, nobody knew about me going to Inter. And the pictures, it’s a lie. He’s a liar,” Benítez said. “In Italy everyone knows him, and at Inter everyone knows him. What he said he told Mourinho was not true. Nobody knew Mourinho was leaving and no one knew the Inter position would be available. I don’t know his locker room, so it’s a lie. If you talk lies, he’s a liar. “I want to be professional and respect people. But everyone knows him. He cannot discredit anyone because everyone knows him. Forget about him. “Keep talking about Chelsea because we’re wasting time. It’s a lie. Simple. Finished.”

Ireland international hooker Richardt Strauss has been diagnosed with a heart condition and he will not play again this season. Strauss, 27, is set to undergo surgery this week, his provincial team Leinster announced. The South Africa-born player made his Ireland debut against the Springboks last year. He has won four caps, but missed the whole of last season's Six Nations because of an ankle ligament injury. "Following the result of extensive medical tests, it has emerged that Ireland hooker Richardt Strauss has been diagnosed with a heart condition and will be unavailable for selection for the remainder of the season," Leinster said, in a statement. "The management are confident that the 27-year-old, who is set to undergo surgery this week, will make a full recovery and will provide him with the best care in his recovery."

There will be 24 weekly flights to and from Amsterdam, 12 weekly flights to and from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, eight weekly flights to and from Milan's Malpensa Airport, and six weekly services to and from Geneva. It will be Darwin's first UK base. It will use its 50-seat SAAB 2000 regional aircrafts on all of the new routes. "The opening of this new and exciting base by Darwin Airline is a strategic step in our development of Cambridge as a regional international airport,” said Steve Jones of Cambridge Airport. "This puts our city firmly on the international transport map, making it easier for people from around the world to get here."
