City Diary: Are Bob Diamond's frequent City breaks all for charity?
Back in town: Bob Diamond, caught on camera this week, has unfinished business in London By Harriet Dennys, City Diary Editor
7:00AM GMT 11 Jan 2013
Follow Comments
Ousted Barclays boss Bob Diamond just can’t stay away from the city that the bank he told Parliament he “loved” calls home. It emerges the career banker has been combining his new gig giving the occasional lecture at Ivy League institutions with a number of trips back to London over the last few months – apparently on business connected to his charity, The Diamond Family Foundation. This explanation of the penitent banker returning to do God’s work rings true. Earlier this week, as Diamond was snapped by a hawk-eyed passerby on his most recent jaunt to the City (pictured above), his foundation filed a change of business address to the London Bridge office of auditor PwC in the names of Diamond, his wife Jennifer, and children Nell and Robert Diamond III. But whether Diamond oversaw that “purely administrative” change in person, or flew to Britain this week on other unfinished business, PwC refused to say. Interesting to see Bob Diamond is still loyal to Barclays in one respect, after a rocky ride that left him taking extended time out in the States to plot his next move. His charity’s net assets of $2m (£1.2m), as of March 31 2012, are managed by … Barclays Wealth. But for how much longer will this legacy banking arrangement last?

Early start for Kleinman Where was Sky News-maker Mark Kleinman the morning after his scoop from an “information drop” on M&S’s Christmas trading results that sent the City into a tailspin? In The Wolseley by 8am, Diary has learnt. Kleinman was spotted at the Piccadilly restaurant in conversation with GlaxoSmithKline finance chief Simon Dingemans, the former Goldman rainmaker who oversaw €500bn (£410bn) worth of deals for the bank. Dingemans, watched over by an aide, presumably made no information drop of his own as the pair chatted at a discreet corner table. That would be premature even by Kleinman’s standards – GSK’s full-year results are not due until February 6. Meanwhile, Paddy Power was first out of the traps with prices for M&S shareholders keen to take a punt on how long chief Marc Bolland will last in his job. Not long, reckons the bookmaker, which places Bolland as the 9/4 favourite as the next retail CEO to quit, followed by Morrisons boss Dalton Philips, at 5/2. Food for thought for Bolland, whom Paddy Power also prices as a 9/2 shot to be “cooked” by the end of June. This isn’t just a slump, it’s an M&S slump …
Lush rush around the world Citi Private Bank’s board adviser Eddie Jordan will be out of office for the foreseeable future, should the company need to call on his counsel. The ex-racing driver was last seen putting out to sea from the coast of Antigua on a sailing boat bought by his family trust, with the aim of completing the round-the-world Oyster World Rally. Diary hears the Monaco resident’s boat is sponsored by Red Bull, which readers will know goes well with vodka. And the name of the “glorious” vessel? Lush. Silver slickers are 50, not out All hail the rise of the silver-slickers. As the number of people employed in financial services shrinks, and energetic 40-somethings squeeze out their more “seasoned” elders, the next big thing will be a rash of highly profitable start-ups from the City’s still-got-it 50-somethings. “You haven’t heard of them yet, but they will be big,” predicts investment banking grandee Anthony Fry, 57, confidently. So confidently, in fact, that Diary suspects Fry may be thinking of setting up an advisory practice himself, undercutting the likes of Goldman’s million-pound fees. “I never make plans,” hedges the Espirito Santo UK chairman and BBC trustee. What to give the City grandee who does a lot of entertaining – or just can’t be bothered to change the sheets? The Good Guest, an indoor sleeping bag company set up last month by the ex-mayor of Hammersmith & Fulham, is doing a roaring trade in the more austere circles of the City. Fans include Reliance Security founder Brian Kingham and Robert Benton, chairman of shipbroker Clarksons, who has bought the bags in bulk for his London home. One for each of he and his wife’s ten children, Diary hears.

08 Nov 2013
2-3 tsp curry paste (or to taste – powder will do)
1 tbsp plain flour 175ml/6fl oz stock 500g/a generous 1lb cooked turkey cut into rough chunks, or a mixture of turkey and sausage meat stuffing 150ml/5fl oz (a small carton) single cream
500g/1lb 2oz block of all butter puff pastry
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp nigella (black onion) seed (optional)
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Put a baking sheet in to heat up. Heat the butter and the olive oil in a large pan. Add the leeks (or onions) and cook gently until soft.
Stir in the curry paste or powder and cook for a few seconds, until fragrant. Stir in the flour and then the stock. Bring to a simmer, stirring all the time. Remove from the heat and stir in the turkey and enough cream to make a nice spooning consistency – creamily saucy but not soupy.
Taste and season. Leave to cool.
Grease a 1.2 litre/2 pint metal pie dish. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry about as thick as a £1 coin, and use it to line the dish, letting the extra hang over the sides. Brush the edges with beaten egg. Spoon in the filling.
Roll out the rest of pastry to double the thickness and cover the pie with it. Use a sharp knife to trim away the overhanging pastry. Press the edges together with the tines of a fork. Brush the top with beaten egg then scatter over the nigella seed.
Bake for 20 mins, then lower the heat to 180C/350C/gas 4 and bake for another 20 mins or until golden.

The linkdrop: Monday 28 October, 2013
Rounding up the day's trending stories, videos, and features in seven bitesize paragraphs Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher share a joke on the set of a Star Wars movie By Jonny Cooper
11:21AM GMT 28 Oct 2013
Follow --- The most recent linkdrop can be read here --- 1. Banksy the unpublishable
Venerable street artist Banksy continues his assault of America, land of the free. After peddling just four works of art during a guerrilla street stall stunt earlier this month, he's now had an op-ed piece on the One World Trade centre building rejected by the NYT. Here's 'Banksy' during more comfortable times in good ol' Blighty... Related Articles

2. When The Force went missing
These previously unseen outtakes from Star Wars have only been on YouTube for twelve hours or so. Enjoy them while they're 'fresh' (and look out for some hapless Stormtroopers turning in a great physical comedy performance). 3. What lies beneath New York City
Vanity Fair tunnels under the Big Apple to find a maze of infrastructure and intrigue. It's a long read - but a good one. 4. Worst fire safety demo ever
Pretty much none of this safety exhibition goes as it should - from the gently spreading flames at the start to the moment near the end where the fireman seems to be acting as a human Catherine Wheel. 5. The five ages of sleep
Teenagers are the Yodas of sleep; old people seem to eschew the slumber hours almost entirely. So where do you fit on John Niven's scale of snooze? 6. Blue is the colour, but what is the name?
This simple little website tests your brand knowledge - and calls to attention the preponderance of the colour blue in today's online palette. So, do you know your Instagram blue from your Facebook blue? Or you Twitter blue from your AOL blue? 7. Russia, where bad things seem to happen
Men driving around with axes, handguns, and rifles; cranes falling into buildings; a drunk riding a hog: here's 20 gifs that prove Russia is a little unhinged. 8. What happens on January 12, 2017?
This short story masquerading as a Twitter bug report is worth five minutes of your time. It's a well worked bit of online sci-fi in which a small coding error heralds glimpses of the future.

Dozens of drug users rush to dealer's car 'like children to an icecream van' CCTV footage released by West Midlands Police shows dozens of people running to be first in line as a drug dealer arrives in a Birmingham street. 11:41AM GMT 15 Mar 2013
Forming part of BBC1 series Caught Red Handed, the footage shows the addicts running towards a drug dealer's vehicle just seconds after it pulled up in a street in Bordesley Green, Birmingham. The scene was all the more shocking as it occurred at 8:30am on a weekday morning near a local nursery. West Midlands Police released the clip after 29 men were sentenced to prison as part of Operation No Deal. DCI Nick Walton said: "You'd imagine drug transactions are carried out in a discrete manner, but the footage we obtained shows around 30 people rush towards the dealer's car in broad daylight. "I'd never seen anything like it in my police career. It was clear we needed to take decisive action to tackle the problem. No one should be expected to put up with drug dealing on their doorstep."

Prince William's 30th birthday marked with sea 'doughnut' ride
The Duke of Cambridge celebrated his 30th birthday by being pulled in a rubber ring behind a speed boat, it has been reported. The Duke of Cambridge is said to have been given the present by his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge. Photo: PA	By Telegraph Reporters
10:00AM BST 25 Jun 2012
Follow The second in line to the throne is said to have celebrated the milestone last week by being dragged through the freezing sea near his Welsh home. The high-speed present was booked by his 30 year-old wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, several weeks ago in the expectation that the weather would be “summery”, it was claimed. But instead, the Duke was pulled behind the boat in freezing conditions, pouring rain and bitter winds, causing him to become “soaked to the skin”. Despite the weather the Duke, who turned 30 last Thursday, insisted on going ahead in the sea at Anglesey, North Wales. The Duchess, Prince Harry and a small group of his closest friends were said to have “roared with laughter” as he bounced through the waves. Related Articles

Members of the 12-strong party included his lifelong and best friends Thomas van Straubenzee, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher and David Jardine Paterson. At one point the Duke lost his grip of the “doughnut” and was flung out to the sea, The Sun reported. A source told the newspaper: "For most 30-year-olds who have just inherited £10 million, the last thing they would want to do is freeze themselves on a wet weekend in Wales. But this is typical of William." After drying himself off, the party retired to their tiny rented cottage on the island for a home-cooked supper and drinks. At the weekend it was disclosed that the Duke is to receive a cottage on the Sandringham estate to mark his 30th birthday. The gift from the Queen will be made available to him and his wife later this year. Alongside the cottage, the Duke also received £10 million from his mother’s estate for his 30th birthday. The inheritance has fuelled rumours that the Duke will build a property in which he could raise a family. But a royal aide has insisted there will be no obvious change to Prince William’s lifestyle over the coming weeks or months. Palace aides have said the Duke celebrated his birthday in a low-key and private fashion. The Royal Family
