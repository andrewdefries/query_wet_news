Fern Britton reveals how her depression led to a suicide attempt Fern Britton, the host of This Morning programme, has spoken of her fight with depression which led her to attempt suicide. Fern Britton said there had been days when she "could hardly get out of bed" Photo: SKY	By Urmee Khan 11:58AM GMT 27 Oct 2008
The television presenter revealed how she was so depressed that she planned to crash her car into a brick wallBritton, 51, said: "There were days I could hardly get out of bed. I was so seriously depressed I needed medication. It was very tough. "If I wasn't such a coward, I know I would have killed myself. I contemplated it very seriously. I remember sitting in the bath one day thinking 'How many pills have I got in the bottle?'" she said."I did seriously think about driving the car into a brick wall. It was that bad. I remember writing a letter, not a suicide note, but a letter to myself to read the next day when I was feeling better to see if it made me think, 'Pull yourself together'. But it didn't. It made me cry. I didn't know what to do."The mother of four, describes the experiences in a her forthcoming memoir, 'My Life by Fern Britton'.

Britton said Phil Vickery, the chef, had been her salvation since they met on her show Ready Steady Cook. She said: "I was halfway to falling apart. If it hadn't been for Phil, God knows what would have happened. I think I would have done myself in. Phil was the only person who knew how serious it was. He helped to pull me through." The host of ITV1's This Morning said her husband had been a pillar of strength during the controversy over her gastric band operation in May. She was accused of deceiving people by failing to mention the band and suggesting that her weight loss was down to healthy eating and exercise. She subsequently had time off for stress. "I did it for me because I wanted to. I didn't feel I had to ring round and let everyone know", she said. Celebrity news

Lethal Force to prove decisive in July Cup at Newmarket
Clive Cox’s expertise in developing raw racing talent comes under the microscope again as in-form Lethal Force seeks to step up on his Royal Ascot triumph by winning Saturday's Darley July Cup at Newmarket.

Comments
The four-year-old lived up to encouraging reports of his progress with an emphatic victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, over six furlongs. He finished off his race really strongly, suggesting he is well up to another major success against similar opposition.
Cox is gaining a reputation for moulding and developing young horses and Lethal Force is an excellent example of his skill. There is no reason why this sprinter should not go on improving and I fancy him to get the better of South African challenger Shea Shea and the King’s Stand winner Sole Power.
Shea Shea was caught close to home by Sole Power in the King’s Stand over five furlongs at the Royal meeting, but there is enough evidence to suggest the latter is better over five furlongs than six and I expect this to prove a completely different test.
Another feasible option is the Aidan O’Brien-trained Gale Force Ten, who won the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot. In an interesting move O’Brien will fit blinkers for the first time to the three-year-old. With the added advantage of Ryan Moore in the saddle, he could prove the biggest danger.
Not only is there high-class racing at Newmarket, York, Ascot and Chester, the French supply one of the highlights of the weekend in the Group One Juddmonte Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. Once again, the Epsom Derby form faces a thorough examination.

Battle Of Marengo, second in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot after finishing fourth at Epsom, is reopposed by Derby fifth Ocovango. As only half-a-length separated the pair at Epsom, I fancy the Andre Fabre-trained colt to get back on the winning list.
Brian Toomey, the jump jockey who suffered a severe head injury at Perth last week, has made some slight improvement, according to a report issued by the Injured Jockeys Fund on Friday.
Although he remains in intensive care, he is no longer under sedation and his condition has not deteriorated. There have been signs of movement, although he remains on a ventilator to assist his breathing. Close friends are welcome to visit, according to the statement.

Parents using GPS tags to monitor their child's whereabouts
Growing numbers of parents are turning to technology to allay their anxieties about their children’s whereabouts by getting them to wear satellite tracking devices.
'Freedom for Kids' devices are designed to simply clip onto a child’s wrist By Rebecca McGann, and John Bingham
7:30AM BST 30 Jun 2013
Comments
Barely distinguishable from a wrist watch, the systems use a combination of the technology in motorists’ sat nav devices and methods used by police to track criminals by their mobile phone signal.
Already popular in the US, internet retailers have reported a steady growth in sales in Britain as parents try to reconcile calls from experts to give their children greater freedom to play, with anxiety about traffic and strangers.
In a vivid illustration of how technology is transforming family life, some parents are using them to keep tabs on older children as they travel the world on gap years. Meanwhile children have also begun to use them as a “bargaining tool” with their parents, agreeing to wear one in return for permission to go out with their friends. Charities said they could prove a pragmatic extra protection for older children but cautioned that parents could be lulled into a “false sense of security”.
GPS tracking devices and tags are already widely used for wandering pets as well as, controversially, dementia patients living at home.

One retailer which markets cords fitted with tracking devices for elderly people claims to have sold its products to social care departments in 90 per cent of local authorities.
Variants for children have, until recently, remained a niche market, largely confined to special schools and parts of the criminal justice system.
The devices work by sending a satellite signal to a computer or mobile phone. The parent then logs onto their account via the internet or can send a text to a special number to receive a message back indicating the wearer’s location, accurate to within 10ft. Steve Salmon, chief executive of the specialist GPS supplier “Lok8u”, said that while the bulk of orders for his “Freedom for Kids” devices are from the US, he now sells up to 200 devices a month in the UK. The devices are marketed for children as young as five and designed to simply clip onto a child’s wrist. Prices start from £100. Mr Salmon said he had noticed an annual pattern with sales peaking in July as the school holidays begin, and again in late August as parents prepare to send their children back to school. He added that he had more inquiries in the wake of the disappearance of five-year-old April Jones in North Wales last year.
Mark Carfe, chief executive of Trackershop-uk, another supplier, said he sells about 150 trackers a month to British parents, with sales rising by 20 per cent in the last year.
“It is not the case that parents want to snoop on where or what their children are doing so much as that they want an added sense of security from knowing that their children are indeed where they should be,” he said.
“If something untoward should happen they can be alerted, 24 hours a day, globally and instantly. Our trackers do all of this.”
But he said there were also unexpected uses – with students even using them to produce digital souvenirs of their gap years. “The tracker is recording all of its movements, so is a fantastic way of replaying a holiday, school trip or gap year travel,” he said.
A spokesman for the NSPCC said that the devices could be helpful if used alongside more traditional ways of supervising their children but expressed reservations. “I’m not sure we would promote or endorse them as they could breed a false sense of security; there is no proof they will help,” he said.
“Just because you know where the GPS is doesn’t definitely mean you know it’s still with the child or even that you can get there quickly.”
