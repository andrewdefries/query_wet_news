Liverpool Biennial 2012: Where stalkers are stalked and lifts smash into the pavement
The theme of this year’s Liverpool Biennial, “Hospitality”, feels highly relevant to this port city with its history of departures and arrivals, writes Mark Hudson.

As you enter the Cunard Building, a magnificent but little-visited 1930s edifice on Liverpool’s waterfront, your eye alights on a mass of estate agents’ signboards. Surely things haven’t got so bad in Liverpool that even this majestic building is to be let out and sold off piecemeal.
These signs have, in fact, been painted on canvas by Danish artists’ collective Superflex as part of the Liverpool Biennial 2012, the latest manifestation of Britain’s biggest contemporary art event, featuring works by 242 artists in 27 venues around the city — and many more in fringe events and exhibitions.
This year’s theme, “Hospitality”, feels highly relevant to this port city with its history of departures and arrivals. But Superflex’s signboard installation gives it a perplexing edge, alluding to the large number of buildings standing empty across the city that aren’t hosting anything.
Where once the Venice Biennale was the only international art event of any significance, the Liverpool Biennial is typical of new breed of mega-exhibition that has grown up over the past two decades, with new biennials and triennials springing up everywhere from Istanbul to Whitstable. All aim to make a global impact on art, while hopefully bringing economic development in their wake.
Liverpool’s success in the latter capacity is impressive, on paper at least, with visitors to the last biennial spending £27 million. Yet this upsurge in international art activity has also given rise to a whole new class of international artists and curators who make at least part of their living from servicing these events.

Walking the Cunard Building’s palatial floors you encounter, in quick succession: an immersive video installation about a Johannesburg tower block; renditions of failed utopian speeches by Russian punk singers and performance poets; and a very funny film by Tunisian-German artist Nadia Kaabi-Linke in which the UK visa application form is performed in the manner of the Anglican liturgy.
Some of these works are more interesting or entertaining than others. But there’s the sense that a similar range of ideas is being employed everywhere in the world and a similar language used to explain them — manifested in a flurry of curatorial discourse-bites that buzz all over the Biennial.
Entering the Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool’s venue for photographic art, we’re informed that the exhibits concern “how we use public spaces in our quest for sexual desire”, though Kohei Yoshiykui’s voyeuristic photographs, which bizarrely stalk peeping toms, are some of the few works across this vast festival that feel bound into a particular culture — in this case, Japan.
The sense that talking about the art is as important as the art itself is compounded in American artist Doug Aitken’s The Source at Tate Liverpool, a series of filmed conversations on creativity with artists as diverse as veteran photographer William Eggleston and the White Stripes’ Jack White, projected on to six large screens which surround the viewer in circular formation. While the conversations are beautifully shot, the whole project reeks of cosy self-congratulation.
Alongside the main Biennial are a range of events, including the John Moores Painting Prize exhibition, now in its 55th year, at the Victorian Walker Art Gallery, and Bloomberg New Contemporaries, a show of the best student graduation work from around the country, held in the Copperas Hill Building, a vast former sorting office near Lime Street Station. The young artists’ work struggles for attention amid these vast industrial spaces, but City States on the floor above gives space to a number of cities to present themselves through art in a kind of zany alternative trade fair. Vilnius is represented by a gigantic, room-filling black pillow, Nuuk in Greenland by a collection of suspended glass vessels containing seal blubber, Birmingham by a collection of anarcho-punk fanzines.
It might sound odd to call a festival of cutting-edge art a great day out for the family, but among the work on offer there’s a lot that provides good, honest entertainment, from a Chinese-language reworking of Roman Polanski’s film Chinatown shown in Liverpool’s real Chinatown to Oded Hirsch’s Peter’s Lane, a lift smashed into the pavement of the new Liverpool One shopping centre.
If many works feel like not much more than visual jokes, and of varied quality, British artist John Akomfrah’s film The Unfinished Conversation at the Blue Coat Gallery is a work of real depth and imagination. A subtly layered portrait of the Jamaican-born academic and cultural theorist Stuart Hall projected across three screens, it shifts freely in time and space around its subject, exploring his conflicts of identity and belonging in a way that tells us a great deal about what Britain has become over the past half century.

Colorado Batman shooting: woman survives thanks to brain defect The survival of a woman shot in the head during the Colorado cinema massacre has been hailed as a "miracle" after a shotgun pellet traversed the precise course of a brain defect she was unaware she had. Miss Anderson, a violinist, has recently graduated from the Conservatory of Music at the University of the Pacific in California, and is due to start a master's degree in Maryland Photo: FACEBOOK	By Nick Allen, Aurora, Colorado
7:10PM BST 24 Jul 2012
Follow According to her family Petra Anderson, 22, a musician, lived because she had a rare genetic condition that left her with a small channel of fluid running from the front to back of her brain.
When she was shot in the face the projectile followed the exact course of the defect, avoiding vital areas and lodging in the rear of her head.
Doctors removed it after five hours of surgery.
Her sister Chloe Anderson, 25, said: "It entered right through her nose. It went all the way through her brain and to the back of her skull. It did little damage which is a mystery to many people including the doctors."
Miss Anderson, a violinist, had recently graduated from the Conservatory of Music at the University of the Pacific in California, and is due to start a master's degree in Maryland.

James Holmes in court: as it happened
23 Jul 2012
She had gone to the cinema with two friends to see Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises" and was among the victims when a gunman dressed in body armour began spraying the audience with bullets.
Twelve people were killed and 58 injured. Suspect James Holmes, 24, who later identified himself to police as "The Joker," made his first appearance in court on Monday.
Miss Anderson's mother Kim Anderson, who has terminal cancer, said her daughter was expected to make a full recovery.
"I believe that she was not only protected by God, but that she was actually prepared for it," she said. "God won't let the suffering or the setbacks have the last word."
Brad Strait, the family's Presbyterian pastor who was at the hospital with them, said: "Kim and I know a miracle when we see it. The doctor explained that Petra's brain has had from birth a small 'defect' in it.
"It is a tiny channel of fluid running through her skull like a tiny vein through marble. A millimetre in any direction and the channel is missed, the brain is destroyed, evil wins a round."
Another woman who survived the mass shooting on Friday went into labour in the same hospital where her critically injured husband is being treated.
Katie Medley, 21, gave birth to a boy she named Hugo, while her husband Caleb Medley, 23, a stand up comedian, was one floor away in a medically induced coma.
He has lost his right eye and suffered some brain damage, according to his family. He was one of 16 victims still in hospital.
Mrs Medley said of the shooting: "I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene.
"Then he opened fire and Caleb was shot in the right eye as they all tried to duck and cover."
A friend of Caleb and Katie Medley said their first baby was “doing great.” Michael West added: “He is loud and full of life just like his daddy.”
Family members said Mr Medley was showing some improvement and “can tell who we are.”
It was unclear if the baby would be brought to see him because of the risk of infections.
Bomb disposal experts revealed more details about the booby traps Holmes placed in his apartment before the attack.
There were 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline in glass containers. Had they gone off they would have engulfed the entire apartment block.
A control box had been positioned in the kitchen with wires leading to it like "spaghetti." A law enforcement officials said the set up was similar to improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan. A man who was in the audience when the gunman opened fire is suing the cinema, movie producers, and doctors.
Torrence Brown, Jr, whose friend AJ Boik was killed, is suing the Warner Bros studio, claiming Holmes copied violence in the film.
He said: “Somebody has to be responsible for the rampant violence that is shown today.”
He is also suing Holmes’ doctors who he argues should have monitored him.

Cristiano Ronaldo transfer: I've had my time at Manchester United, says Cristiano Ronaldo Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled his £80m transfer to Real Madrid as "historic" after admitting that his time is up at Manchester United.

Comments
Ronaldo, 24, is set to seal a world record move to the Bernabeu following Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to accept Real's offer for the Portuguese winger.
The deal ends Real's two-year pursuit of Ronaldo, who learned of United's acceptance of the bid while in Los Angeles, where he is currently on holiday.
Ronaldo said: "It's flattering when two of the top teams in the world want you to play for them, but I have had my time at Manchester United.
"Now I can look forward to Real Madrid and a new stage in my career.
"I learned about the deal here in Los Angeles and have heard from my people that Manchester United have accepted.

"I am on vacation and will remain in Los Angeles for a bit more, but the deal is historic. £80 million is quite a sum of money."
Real are ready to send a medical team to Los Angeles to assess Ronaldo's fitness following his withdrawal from Portugal's squad for the midweek friendly against Estonia due to a suspected hernia problem.
But the player insists that he will be fit to start pre-season training with his new club after ruling out the need for surgery.
Ronaldo said: "I have been told that Madrid want to have a medical team look at me as expected, but I do not require a surgery. The hernia is nothing to worry about." Manchester United

Google doodle becomes an enigma in honour of Alan Turing
Search giant Google has turned its homepage "doodle" into a Turing machine in honour of British mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing. The Google Doodle has been replaced with an interactive animation of a Turing machine to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Alan Turing 4:34PM BST 23 Jun 2012
Comments
The Google Doodle was turned into an interactive animated representation of the computing device Turing invented to mark the 100th anniversary of the scientist's birth. Turing, regarded as the father of computing and artificial intelligence, is best known for his contribution to cracking the German Enigma codes during the second world war with the creation of early computers such as the bombe. On Saturday scientists and others paying tribute to Turing gathered in Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge to take part in events to celebrate his work. Plaques in his honour will be erected in Cambridge, Manchester and at his childhood home, Baston Lodge in St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex. A spokeswoman for Alan Turing Year, a campaign to celebrate his work during the whole of 2012, said: "Turing was godfather of computer science and (an) artificial intelligence pioneer, as well as someone who saved literally millions of lives through his code breaking work."

Turing's anniversary comes as a leading academic has claimed that the mathematician may not have committed suicide but had died as a result of an accident. Professor Jack Copeland, director the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, believes crucial evidence was overlooked following Turing's death from cyanide poisoning at the age of 41 in 1954. He believes Turing could have died as a result of inhaling the poison he used in amateur experiments rather than deliberately ingesting it. Professor Copeland, who has written a new biography of the academic to be published shortly, said: "From the records I have been able to obtain, it seems to me very obvious that the inquest was conducted in a very superficial way. "The coroner didn't really investigate the evidence at all, he just jumped to the conclusion that he committed suicide. "He seems to have been very biased from the statements in newspapers at the time." The coroner in Turing's death case ruled he committed suicide "while the balance of his mind was disturbed", adding: "In a man of his type, one never knows what his mental processes are going to do next." Turing, who was gay, was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952. To avoid prison, he agreed to receive injections of oestrogen for a year, which were intended to reduce his libido in a process known as "chemical castration". In 2009 Gordon Brown issued an official apology for the way Turing had been treated. Professor Copeland, from the University of Canterbury Christchurch in New Zealand, will talk about Turing's death at an event in Oxford on Saturday night. He said medical evidence suggested Turing died from inhaling cyanide rather than drinking or ingesting it. He said police reported a strong smell of cyanide coming from Turing's lab, where he used it in amateur experiments. The inquest should be reopened "if possible", he said. "It would be a terrific thing to do. I think the nation owes it to Turing, in the Second World War he saved the nation." Perhaps best known for his part in breaking the German Enigma code, Turing was by that time already established as a mathematician of extraordinary capability. During his time at King's College, Cambridge, he devised the "Turing Machine", a mathematical model that went on to become one of the cornerstones of computer science, when aged just 22.

The evolution of Grand Theft Auto
From the unveiling of 1997's original Grand Theft Auto to the imminent release of the highly anticipated fifth installment, the GTA series has been winning fans and angering critics for 16 years. 11:23AM BST 13 Sep 2013
Comments
Grand Theft Auto V - the latest title in the phenomenally successful series by Rockstar Games - is due for release on 17 September. It has proved to be one of the the most hyped games of the year, with a string of leaks and released details from Rockstar fuelling anticipation for the title. According to a recent report in The Scotsman, GTA V is the most expensive video game ever made, with a development and marketing budget of £170 million – the equivalent of a blockbuster film. The GTA series has seen incredible changes as the two dimensional landscape of the 1997 original has morphed into a ultra realistic 3D world packed with storylines, context, richness and depth scarcely imaginable 16 years ago.
