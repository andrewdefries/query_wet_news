We need to cool things down over climate change
It is surely past time to take matters out of the hands of the zealots – on both sides
Climate change campaigners have not been helped by the fact that their advocates include some of the bossiest and most irritating people in politics like Chris Huhne, Caroline Lucas and Ed Miliband Photo: Getty Images	By Telegraph View

Climate wars are about to break out again. When the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is released today – after the world’s politicians have finished tinkering with the draft conclusions produced by their scientific advisers – it will be a cue for the usual overheated rhetoric from both sides. Some will warn that the report grotesquely underestimates the dangers of imminent global apocalypse; others that the whole thing is a tissue of fabrications from an organisation that has lost any credibility.
Certainly, the years since the release of the IPCC’s last report, in 2007, have not been kind to its authors. One of its claims – that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 – turned out to be a ludicrous exaggeration, based on nothing remotely resembling peer-reviewed science. Global temperatures have failed to follow the upward path predicted, causing many to question whether the problem is as severe as they were told. And the multinational conference in Copenhagen that was intended to forge a new global agreement to replace the Kyoto treaty collapsed in rancorous acrimony.
Climate change campaigners have not been helped by the fact that their advocates include some of the bossiest and most irritating people in politics. When told by the likes of Chris Huhne, Caroline Lucas or Ed Miliband that they must pay sky-high energy bills to plaster the country in ineffective wind turbines, it is no wonder that the public are resentful.
It is surely past time, therefore, to take matters out of the hands of the zealots – on both sides. No one can deny that mankind is pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at unprecedented rates, or that this will inevitably have a warming effect on the climate (the reason for the current “pause”, scientists believe, is that the heat has been stored up in the deep oceans, as part of a natural cycle). The debate is over the extent of the problem, and the possible solutions.
Rather than issuing prophecies of doom, policy-makers must start afresh, with a serious, realistic conversation with the public about what is happening, and what is to be done. In particular, it is far from clear that taking an axe to advanced economies will do anything to make matters better, not least since the developing world will not deny itself prosperity in the name of environmental extremism. Instead of issuing quixotic calls for a complete decarbonisation of the economy, politicians should foster investment in innovations that can wean us off fossil fuels without damaging growth, and research sensible, cost-effective ways to adapt to a changing climate. The last thing the planet needs is more hot air.

Richard Briers: The Good Life star battling emphysema
Richard Briers, the healthy, vegetable-growing star of The Good Life on television, has emphysema, he disclosed last night.
It’s still a good life: Richard Briers enjoys spending time with his children and grandchildren Photo: REX FEATURES By Telegraph Reporters
6:30AM GMT 01 Feb 2013
Follow The 79-year-old admitted his smoking habit involving about 500,000 cigarettes had left him dying. The father-of-two admitted it was “too late” and that “the ciggies got me”. Mr Briers made the admission during an interview alongside Prunella Scales, his 80 year-old co-star in the sixties sitcom Marriage Lines. The pair have remained close friends, but Mr Briers said his other principal co-star Felicity Kendal, 66, who played his wife in the Seventies hit The Good Life, had “disappeared” from his life. “I’ve got emphysema, you see, so I’m b*****d,” he told the Daily Mail.

“Five hundred thousand cigarettes, darling — that’s the trouble. “I haven’t even got the strength to garden any more.”
Good Life stars (L-R) Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal, Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith (Picture: BBC)
He added: “It’s totally my fault. So, I get very breathless, which is a pain in the backside. Trying to get upstairs, oh God, it’s ridiculous. Of course, when you’re bloody nearly 80 it’s depressing because you’ve had it anyway. "The ciggies got me. I stopped ten years ago but too late. If you do it in your thirties then you’re okay, but after 30 it gets you. “I was diagnosed five years ago and didn’t think it would go quite as badly as it has. It’s a b*****, but there it is. I used to love smoking.”
In The Good Life, Mr Briers played Tom Good, a suburban husband who gives up his job and leads a self-sufficient lifestyle by growing his own food in his garden. The show’s comedy was centred on his bickering relationship with Barbara, his wife played by Miss Kendal. He disclosed the pair had never been close in real life and have since lost contact with each other. Health News

David Cameron's ban on cheap alcohol 'may fail to curb drinking'
A ban on cheap alcohol may do nothing to cut crime or prevent health problems resulting from excessive drinking, research warns today.
An Adam Smith Institute report warns there is no evidence that a minimum price for alcohol will cut problem drinking. Photo: ALAMY	By Tim Ross, Political Correspondent
6:00AM GMT 26 Nov 2012
Follow David Cameron is preparing to introduce a minimum price of at least 40p per unit of alcohol and ministers are expected to launch a public consultation on the scheme within days. However, a report published by the Adam Smith Institute found that there was no evidence that a minimum price would reduce the harm caused by high levels of drinking. Such a move could even lead to a new illicit market in alcoholic drinks, push poorer drinkers into poverty, and fail to acknowledge the potential health benefits of moderate drinking, the report said. The proposals for a minimum price have been highly divisive in government, with the Prime Minister facing opposition from inside the Cabinet. Mr Cameron is thought to be personally committed to the idea and argued this year that a 40p minimum unit price could result in 50,000 fewer crimes a year and 900 fewer alcohol-related deaths a year by the end of the decade.

Alcohol concern: minimum unit price will save lives
28 Nov 2012
However, John C Duffy, a former government health official with 40 years’ experience as a statistician working on alcohol-related problems, warned that ministers had no evidence to back up the figures. His study claimed that the proposal for a minimum price per unit of alcohol was based on a single, flawed computer model, which assumed that the reform would have a significant impact on heavy drinkers. But this ignores the psychological and social reasons why some people drink to excess, the researchers said. The model, devised by the University of Sheffield, predicts the effect of minimum pricing on NHS expenditure, crime and unemployment. But it is based on untested “assumptions” and “wild speculation”, Mr Duffy’s report states. “There is not enough information around to produce a reliable model,” he said. Christopher Snowdon, co-author of the report, said ministers were in danger of making a “mistake”. “Minimum pricing might reduce alcohol harm, or it might increase it, or it might bring about other unexpected consequences, good or bad,” he said. “An admission that the evidence base is, to all intents and purposes, non-existent is less likely to mislead decision-makers than a spurious prediction. “The only certainty is that minimum pricing will transfer large sums of money from the poorest people in society to wealthy industries. This is a deeply regressive leap into the unknown and it should not be taken as a response to wafer-thin ‘evidence’.”
The Home Office has modelled a minimum price of 40p but health campaigners have called for the level to be set at 50p, mirroring the policy in Scotland. The Treasury is said to be reluctant to introduce a 50p rate on the grounds that it would damage the drinks market and lead to a dramatic fall in tax receipts. Senior Liberal Democrats are said to believe the plan is “illiberal” and Andrew Lansley, the Leader of the House of Commons, has also voiced concerns. However, Mr Cameron is understood to have resolved to press ahead with the plans, which may include a compromise option of 45p per unit. A Downing Street spokesman said the proposals would be published “shortly”. “Binge drinking isn’t some fringe issue, it accounts for half of all alcohol consumed in this country,” he said. “The crime and violence it causes drains resources in our hospitals, generates mayhem on our streets and spreads fear in our communities.”

North Korea 'under martial law' North Korea has been placed under martial law and Kim Jong-un has told his front-line troops to "be ready for a war," according to South Korean media reports. A woman walks by a board which reads 'Forward to Final Victory under Leadership of Great Party' (L) and another reads reads 'Let's firmly arm ourselves with the patriotism of Kim Jong Il,' in Changgwang Street, Pothonggang District of Pyongyang, North Korea Photo: AP	By Julian Ryall in Tokyo 4:29AM GMT 31 Jan 2013
In an emergency meeting of his top defence and security officials on Saturday, the North Korean leader issued a series of orders that included the conclusion of preparations for a new nuclear test, the Joongang Daily reported.North Korean state media has also reported that Kim ordered his officials to take "effective, high-profile state measures."While it has been anticipated that Pyongyang will go ahead with what will be the regime's third nuclear test, in spite of international pressure to refrain from doing so, analysts had predicted that the blast would be timed to coincide with the birthday on February 16 of Kim Jong-il, the former leader who died in late 2011, or the inauguration of the new government in South Korea nine days later.The reports now suggest that the demonstration of North Korea's nuclear prowess is more imminent.In March 1993, North Korea placed the nation under martial law shortly before it announced it was withdrawing from the Treaty in the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The regime also ordered its troops to be ready for war.

Pyongyang's preparations have been corroborated by South Korean government officials and sources in Beijing, with surveillance images suggesting that the mouth of the shaft has been sealed in readiness for the test at the Pyunggye-ri site.North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006 and carried out a second underground detonation in May 2009.This latest test is in direct response to international criticism of its launch of a rocket in December that Pyongyang claimed was for peaceful purposes. The United Nations Security Council concluded unanimously that it was a test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile.Lee Myung-bak, the president of South Korea, ordered the military to be ready to make a "strong response" to any provocation from North Korea.
