Real IRA denies inquiry threat
12:00AM BST 10 Apr 2002
The Real IRA said yesterday that police and military witnesses due to give evidence to the Bloody Sunday inquiry were under no threat. The suggestion that the republican terrorist group posed a threat to witnesses was "a smokescreen". Military witnesses are to give evidence in London when the Saville inquiry moves there from Londonderry in September. Lawyers had argued that making them go to Londonderry would endanger them. News

George Osborne says he's happy Obama called him 'Jeffrey'
George Osborne has joked that he is pleased to be “on first-name terms” with Barack Obama even though the US President got his name wrong.

At the G8 summit last week, Mr Obama had to apologise to the Chancellor after calling him “Jeffrey” three times during talks on tax avoidance. The President confessed that he had confused Mr Osborne with his favourite R&B singer, Jeffrey Osborne. The singer subsequently appeared on television to invite the Chancellor to join him in a duet. Teased about the President’s mistake in an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Mr Osborne joked that his new friendship with “the cool Osborne” was not progressing smoothly. “He asked me to do a duet, sadly I can’t sing. He has now asked me for a game of golf and I can’t play golf, so it’s not going very well, this new friendship,” the Chancellor said. Related Articles

“It’s nice to be on first-name terms with the President of the United States, even if he sometimes gets the name wrong. That’s the way I would look at it.”
Mr Obama apparently suffered a short bout of memory loss during a presentation by the Chancellor at the Lough Erne summit. The President earnestly told the other world leaders that he agreed fully with “Jeffrey” during the discussion. Mr Osborne, however, continued with his speech, despite the interventions from Mr Obama. At the end of the presentation, Mr Obama realised his mistake and apologised to the Chancellor. “I’m sorry, man. I must have confused you with my favourite R&B singer,” he said. Jeffrey Osborne is a well-known R&B and soul singer from Rhode Island. He was the former lead singer of seventies band, L. T. D, before scoring a top 30 hit in the US charts with one of his first singles as a solo artist, On the Wings of Love. He went on to record five gold and platinum albums as a solo singer. Politics

David Cameron: Church needs to 'get with the programme' after rejecting women bishops
The Church of England needs a "sharp prod" towards the modern world after its "disappointing" decision to vote against women bishops, David Cameron has said.
By Rowena Mason and Tim Ross
12:56PM GMT 21 Nov 2012
Comments
In his weekly question time, the Prime Minister said he would "certainly look carefully" about how Parliament can make the Church of England "get with the programme". Mr Cameron has previously said the issue is not a matter for politicians. However, his remarks raise the possibility that the Government could use equality laws to force the Church to accept women as bishops. Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP and former culture minister, told the BBC's World at One that he ask the House of Commons authorities how Parliament can intervene to make the Church change its mind. The Church of England is currently exempted from equality legislation forcing all groups to treat their male and female members the same. Mr Bradshaw suggested this could be repealed. "The Church of England is not like any other church," Mr Bradshaw said. "The Church of England is established and answerable to parliament and if Church of England Synod is not able to save itself then I think Parliament does have a role. The parliamentarians I have spoken to are dismayed. Forty-two out of 44 dioceses supported women's bishops. Related Articles

"I am asking the clerks and lawyers in the house and those who help serve the ecclesiastical committee what locus we would have. There is the possibility as to whether we would look at repealing the exemption to the quality legislation. That would be a big step and might take a bit longer."
If Parliament were to take on the bishops, it raises the possibility that the Church of England could lose its established status and split from the state. Politicians intervened after the Church’s decision-making General Synod yesterday tore up plans to ordain women as bishops for the first time. The Prime Minister told the House of Commons that he is a "strong supporter of women bishops" and "very sad" about the outcome of the vote. Did the General Synod make the right decision to reject women bishops?
"I'm particularly sad for the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, because I know he saw this as the major campaign he wanted to achieve at the end of his excellent tenure of that office," he said. "I'm very clear the time is right for women bishops, it was right many years ago. They need to get on with it, as it were, and get with the programme. "But you do have to respect the individual institutions and the way they work while giving them a sharp prod." Mr Cameron's “personal view” is that women should be able to hold the highest offices in the Established Church but that it was not a matter for politicians to decide. Downing Street earlier said there were no plans to change the law to force the Church of England to comply with equality legislation that bans discrimination on the basis of a person’s sex. But Mr Cameron told MPs that he will "look carefully" at what can be done. The Church is facing what many regard as its greatest crisis for a generation after the reforms were defeated by just six votes despite winning the support of Rowan Williams and his appointed successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Chukka Ummuna, the shadow business secretary, said he is "utterly dismayed"
"It makes Church of England looks thoroughly out of touch and out of step," he said. "The queen is the head of the Church of England If the Queen can head the Church of England why can't we have female bishops."
Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, said the Synod vote was “disappointing” and had left the Church of England “in crisis”. “This debate will continue and it will continue to damage the Church,” he told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme. “That is bad for our society whether one is a member of the Church of England or not.”
He suggested it would be “difficult” for the Church to “project moral authority” after the vote. Politics

Michael Owen - a 'killer' goalscorer synonymous with youth and two gilded memories
Young men felt old and the middle-aged were lost to nostalgia as Michael Owen announced his retirement from the game at the end of the season. In the country’s mind, England’s all-time fourth leading goalscorer is synonymous with youth and two gilded memories.

The first was his audacious, slaloming goal against Argentina in Saint-Etienne during the 1998 World Cup. The second is arguably better: a hat-trick in a 5-1 win over Germany in Munich in 2001. After that trio of hits Sven-Goran-Eriksson, the England coach, said of him: "He’s cold. He’s a killer."
Owen has been the subject of much vilification in recent years on social media and elsewhere. Newcastle fans have accused him of being along for the ride during his unhappy time on Tyneside: an accusation he considers unfounded and offensive. Liverpool fans turned on him for moving to Manchester United after Newcastle. Yet when the announcement came that he will cease playing when his contract at Stoke runs out in May the prevailing sense was one of admiration and regret. Since 2001, England have laid on few spectacles to compare with Owen’s spectacular goal at France 98 or his hat-trick against Germany. His club career tailed-off. But his 350 appearances for Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United point to a solid body of work that was always going to be hard to extend, given his precocity, his susceptibility to injury and the change in tactical style that rendered his predatory style of play less popular.

The decisive point on his journey was unquestionably his move in 2004 to Real Madrid, where he was used mostly as back-up to Ronaldo and Raul. Though he scored the winning goal in a Clasico against Barcelona (and 16 overall), his subsequent move to Newcastle caused his career to stall. By the time he reached Manchester United he was too far off his prime to make a major impact but Sir Alex Ferguson always spoke warmly of his professionalism and influence on the dressing-room. The move to Stoke at a time when Tony Pulis’ team were reverting to an even more direct style was the final inauspicious chapter. But when his 16 years were assessed on the day of his announcement Owen’s achievements with Liverpool and England especially shone through again. The appreciation of him rose once more to the level where it should be. England

Wet and stormy weekend due to seal 2012's title as wettest year on record
The New Year is to start with sunshine, but 2012's deluge will continue into Monday, according to forecasters. A vehicle makes its way through flood water on Calmore Road in Totton, Hampshire Photo: PA	By David Barrett, and Richard Gray
12:55PM GMT 29 Dec 2012
Comments
Put away your brollies and stand-down the sandbags (at least temporarily): 2013 is forecast to start with sunshine.
The first day of the New Year will have sunny spells, albeit tempered with scattered showers, offering some hope that a year which has seen England achieve a record for rainfall may be followed by better conditions.
However, there will be little respite from 2012’s deluge before then, meaning that the whole of Britain can also expect to record 2012 as the wettest ever.
Up to two inches of rain are expected in some areas before clouds begin to move away during Monday, meaning 2012 is likely to secure the little-desired title of the wettest year since records began in 1910.
The west of England and Wales - where parts are already underwater - were forecast to take the brunt of the latest downpours on Sunday and Monday.

Six weeks of rain expected by New Year as deluge continues
26 Dec 2012
Gareth Harvey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said temperatures will peak at 46F across most of England and Wales on New Year’s Day. Scotland will see a maximum of 43F.
“There should be sunny spells between showers for pretty much everywhere across the UK,” he said.
“It will be quite windy and squally over most of England and Wales on New Year’s Eve but those winds will ease up. The temperature will then turn quite cold behind all the rain.
“On the evening of New Year’s Eve there is a chance that in the south east there will be a little bit of rain, perhaps in Kent and eastern parts of East Anglia, but even that should disappear by midnight.
“In the rest of England and Wales it looks as though it will be largely dry during the evening on December 31.”
According to the Met Office just under 2in of rain is needed to fall before December 31 to make this year the wettest on record for Britain overall. The country saw 1,291.2mm (just under 51in) of rain between January 1 to December 26, compared with the wettest year on record, 2000, when 1,337.3mm (just over 52½ inches) fell.
A new record has already been set for England with 1,095.8mm (just over 43in) falling between January 1 and Boxing Day.
More than 320 flood warnings and alerts were put in place across England and Wales by the Environment Agency on Saturday night, plus a further 23 in Scotland.
Fine weather on January 1 may offer little indication that 2013 will be better than 2012, however. The year started with the driest spring in more than 100 years and as reservoirs dried up to their lowest ever point, 20 million people were issued with a hosepipe ban and parched roads cracked open.
That was quickly rescinded as a series of freak weather events began: hail stones the size of golfballs caused widespread damage when they fell in Leicestershire in June; that same month more than 111,000 lightning strikes were detected across the UK during one day and an inch of rain fell in just 30 minutes over the north east during storms. The wettest day of all was June 22 when eight inches of rain fell in 24 hours at Honister Pass in the Lake District.
In August there were several reports of tornados: in Oxfordshire, in May, and Somerset, North Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, while in September North Somerset received a month’s worth of rain in just one night. Weather

The bicycle diaries: Serbian hospitality
Continuing his epic 6,000-mile bike ride to India, Douglas Whitehead receives a warm welcome in troubled Serbia.

Five seconds after sitting down outside a cafe in the Serbian border town of Backa Palanka, I was joined by a boy of about six or seven. He had a cheeky face, an equally cheeky manner and introduced himself as Zoltan. He beckoned for me to give him some money. No. Could he have a cigarette, then? Related Articles

Definitely not. Next, he pointed to my bottle of Coca Cola on the table. I wasn't overly enamored with the idea of sharing it as he was grubby, even down the insides of his ears, but the repeated refusals felt mean-spirited. However, rather than taking a drink he simply unscrewed the top and glanced underneath. There must have been a promotion running, but my bottle couldn't have been a winner because he handed the top straight back. The rest of the large but diminutive gang now put in an appearance. Their obvious leader was aged about 11 and had a name that sounded as though it might have been Dragon. He had a rub-on transfer of Spiderman on his hand, and for something to say I asked facetiously if it was a tattoo. He shook his head, then rolled up his tracksuit leg to reveal an inky series of scratchings covering his calf, which depicted ...I don't really know what. Had he done the tattoo himself? Yes. It must have been very painful? No. Where was I from, he wanted to know. He then snatched my map from one of the other boys. Repeating the word "London" he began to slowly run his finger across its length and breadth. As the map went no further north than Hungary, I decided to save him a fruitless search. Quiet, he ordered with a brisk wave of an upturned palm - I was breaking his concentration. Yes, he was in charge, alright. The others, meanwhile, fired off questions until, finally growing bored of my complete inability to answer, regardless of how slowly they spoke, they went over to a well-dressed couple sat at the cafe next-door to offer their services as eaters of ice cream. I confiscated my map and also headed off, only to find at the next stop that my lighter had gone missing. Maybe it had fallen out of my pocket along the way. Maybe it hadn't. The hotel room at Novi Sad, Serbia's second biggest city, contained a nice big double bed ...and nothing else. Electrical wires hung down from the shower in the communal bathroom and there was evidence that the toilet didn't flush. It was Saturday night and the occupants of the room to one side were happily having a party, complete with accordion music. Well, looking on the bright side, the room had cost less than £15. I came down the next morning at about 8am to find a plaque on the wall showing a young Albert Einstein. It was written in the Cyrillic alphabet but I managed to decipher that he had once lived here. Not such a genius, after all. Sophie, the hotel manageress, said some very nice German tourists had stayed before, but a couple of recent female guests from England had complained about absolutely everything. "English women too fussy," she said. She went on to tell me that there was a fashion for cellar bars in Novi Sad. Why? Because since the devastating NATO bombardment of the city in 1999 during the Kosovo war, people now felt psychologically safer underground. Sophie liked to practice her English and the conversation went veering onto many different subjects. Although only 26, she said she was already worried about being left on the shelf. Many of her friends hankered after the Montenegran men in Novi Sad because they had money and designer clothes, having sold their houses on the coast to Western buyers. This was shallow, she said, but added that it was better behavior than that displayed by one of her friends, a Slovenian girl, who had married her brother. Sorry? Whose brother? I thought I must have misunderstood, but I hadn't. "Is that normal," I asked. "Of course, it is not normal," she said, throwing up her hands in exasperation. "I told her I will kill myself before I agree to something like that. She is not my friend now."
"No, I meant is it usual. Does it happen a lot?"
"Yes, but not among Serbs. Some people, they like to keep the wealth in the family."
"And is it legal?"
"No, but very little is illegal if you have money."
Thankfully, our talk then led towards safer ground. "Is it true that the Queen chose Prince William's girlfriend?"
When I looked at my watch it was 2pm. I decided to stay for another night. It's not that Serbs are bad drivers. Judging from the way that they consistently manage to whistle past just inches from your left elbow, they are, in many ways, very good drivers. However, they do seem possessed by an urgent need to overtake each other wherever and whenever possible. Evidence for this can be found in the large number of roadside memorials. As a result, I was deeply relieved to swap the busy and narrow main road out of Novi Sad for a quiet country lane. But although it was a sunny day, a head wind soon picked up that was so strong it was difficult to walk against, let alone cycle. My speed dropped to below 5mph. India? At this rate I would be lucky if I ever made the 30 miles to Belgrade, Serbia's capital. I began to fantasize about a black London cab drawing up by my side. "Lambert Road, Brixton ... and please hurry."
But rather than a taxi, a man on a bicycle came towards me from a side road. He lent over, slapped me on the back and then uttered three very welcome words: "You, me, beer." Like men on a mission we peddled on together side by side. Outside a small store we sat down on a low wooden bench and, sheltered by a high wall, we communicated partly by writing on the ground with a bottle top. He was an apple farmer called Sasha, was 35-years-old, had two children, and was Slovakian although his family had lived in Serbia for at least three generations. He didn't own a car, just the old Chinese-made bicycle that was held together by masking tape, but his lack of wealth did not prevent him from loudly insisting that he bought all the beers. "You guest," he kept saying whenever I tried to protest. "Jiveli" is the Serbian for "Cheers", but despite Sasha's long-suffering efforts to help me pronounce it exactly right, by the third beer I was going backwards. Clinking our bottles together for the umpteenth time, I proclaimed "Jumanji", the title of a mediocre film starring Robin Williams. It was quite funny at the time. Sasha kissed me goodbye on both cheeks and bought me another can of beer for the journey. The gale was still blowing just as fiercely but now I was travelling at twice the speed ... at least for a while. Soon a van driver called Boris pulled up. His English was better. "Do you want to come for a beer with me," he enquired. While many Serbians hold a grudge against the Western media for the way they feel they have been portrayed, any rancour certainly doesn't extend to a personal level. In fact, I don't think I've ever encountered such widespread hospitality as I've enjoyed in the past few days. "Serbs are not bad people," said Boris, who explained that during the Civil War he had been forced to flee from Osijek, the Croatian city I had visited last week. "CNN is wrong about us." He also insisted on paying for the beer. Opening the door of hostel in Belgrade, I was met by the sight of a man slouched on a settee, who wore a large pair of Dr Martens, black leggings and a hoodie, which he drew back to expose a head that was balding and grey on top, but had a long plait of hair that reached right down to the small of his back. Coiled around his neck was a large tattoo of a snake. Angel, as he called himself, had been born in Los Angeles. I would guess he was aged about 60, but his many years as a stage hand with Alice Cooper and several other well-known bands had left him with a face that might have been living the Rock 'n' Roll lifestyle for twice as many years. He had been in Belgrade for about 18 months. Was he enjoying it? "I'm surviving it, man," he said, and went on to explain that he had moved here from Amsterdam where he had met his Serbian wife, another Sophie, ten years ago. "We're here for our kid. She's at the best school in Belgrade, possibly in the whole of Serbia. All the rich kids go there... and those of the famous and the crime bosses. And it's a good city... cheap and not filled with freaks and perverts like New York or London."
But it was a struggle. Their landlord had broken a contract and asked for more rent, and they were presently moving as a family from hostel to hostel. He outlined a number of future entrepreneurial ideas, but bureaucracy was such a problem over here, he said. In the short-term, though, the band AC/DC, who he had worked for previously, were coming to Belgrade next month and he was hoping to drum up some cash from that. Sophie, who was not much more than half Angel's age now joined us, having been asleep in the dormitory. I learned that, early the next morning, she was catching a bus to a resort in Croatia for two months in order to find work. They were off to meet their daughter from school in about an hour. Did I want to go with them? Angel said he would show me the best hamburger joint in the city. "Real meat, none of that big corporation cardboard crap."
Zen was a very bonny and precocious eight-year-old. Bilingual and top of her class, it was clear that she was the apple of both parents' eyes as they took turns to look through her school books at the work she had done that day. They treated her to a pizza, but money was tight so they themselves were going back to the hostel to eat. However, they first had to get Zen's mobile phone unblocked. The man in the phone shop was demanding the equivalent of 10 pounds; they only had eight. An argument ensued and the little girl put her face in her hands as though she was about to cry. Grateful that they had shown me around the city, I began to blurt out that I could I lend them the remainder, but was stopped in my tracks by a glance from Angel. In Britain the prices for such things are fixed, so I had no idea that they were haggling and that Zen was in on the act. The hostel was split into a pair of 10-bed dormitories, one of which was filled by students from Belgrade University. We returned to find that a late booking meant that the other beds in our room had also been taken. The place was packed, leaving them with nowhere to be alone as a family on their last night together for two whole months. A difficult existence, indeed. Earlier, when I asked Sophie what she was going to do in Croatia, she said something about a "bank". As I got to know them, though, I realised that "make bank" was an expression that they both used to signify earning money, so I'm still not sure. Our new roomates were a gang of labourers who were putting up marquees on the bank on the River Danube in preparation for the Serbian Tennis Open. Amongst them was Goran, an Australian, who had moved to Serbia more than a decade ago, and had now built himself a house in the countryside. As the after-work beers began to flow, he explained that the others, who he referred to as his "brothers", all originally heralded from a village in Kosovo but had been forced out at gunpoint by ethnic Albanians. There were 400,000 such refugees now living in Serbia, he added. "I tell you, it's not like they say on the news," - a remark with which I was becoming very familiar. "These are some of the best, the friendliest people on earth."
The gang were a collective and either did everything together or, at least, shared the profits. When they had finished erecting the marquees, Goran was planning on transporting some home-grown tomatoes back to the capital in his van. With Serbia still starved of outside investment and with 30 per cent unemployment and little in the way of social security, you had to be resourceful, he said. "You can't just say 'I'm a welder', for instance, and then sit on your backside until the next welding job comes along."
Goran, himself, had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks in Sydney, had come to his parents' homeland of Serbia to do his military service and then been caught up in the Civil War. Had he seen any action, I wanted to know. Straight forward and gregarious up to that point, his happy smile left him for a short moment. "Yeah, I bagged my fair share of terrorists," he said with a nervous laugh. I sensed it was time to change the subject. After a week-and-a half in Croatia and Serbia the only thing I understand is how much I don't understand. It would possibly take a whole year here before I felt confident enough to be assertive about the problems of the Balkans. What I will say, however, is that any tendencies to portray them as a straight fight between good guys and bad guys do appear to be wide of the mark. Real life is always far more complicated. Let's leave it at that. The next day, suffering from a hangover, I went off to find a repair shop to change a broken spoke and one of the brake cables on my bike. Passing through the smart cafes in Belgrade city centre where the beautiful people hang out, I crossed the railway tracks where Romani gypsies live in the sort of appalling conditions that I had not expected to witness until I got to India. Eventually I found the workmen sitting under a tree, taking a short break. Much back-slapping ensued, and then Goran explained to his boss that I was a Briton who was was cycling to India. "You are crazier than a Serb," said the boss, before reaching into a carrier bag and handing me a beer. The bicycle diaries
