Planning rule book is torn up
Thousands of pages of planning rules are to be torn up, prompting concerns from MPs and campaigners that protections for the countryside will be weakened.
When the panel started the review it discovered there were 7,000 pages of guidance, much of it contradictory and dating from the 1960s Photo: Julian Simmonds	By Christopher Hope, Senior Political Correspondent

A review by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor has concluded that up to 80 per cent of the 7,000 rules governing where development can take place should go.
Last year, the Government faced a major battle over proposals to simplify planning laws, because they appeared to create a bias in favour of builders.
The proposals suggest changes to how that law is interpreted, in a process which could generate new pressure to develop more of the countryside.
The Liberal Democrat peer insisted that the changes would not weaken protections for greenfield areas and would clarify how new national planning policy should work.
But some of the changes, which could apply by March, are likely to be controversial because one of the areas under review is how councils assess housing need. Ministers are desperate to increase house building throughout England.

Buidling on 1,500 square miles of English countryside will not make much difference, says Nick Boles
12 Dec 2012
Last month, Nick Boles, the planning minister, caused a storm by saying that he wanted to see another 1,500 square miles of England developed for housing.
The Daily Telegraph led an eight-month Hands Off Our Land campaign earlier this year before the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was set, urging the Government not to weaken protections for greenfield and green belt land.
Lord Taylor was appointed in October to review thousands of pages of planning guidance which underlies the NPPF.
His review found that existing guidance was “not fit for purpose” and that the “historic accumulation of out-of-date, contradictory and unmanageable material must be brought to an end”.
When the panel started the review it thought that there were 6,000 pages of guidance, but discovered there were 7,000, much of it contradictory and dating from the 1960s.
The peer said: “No one bar my group has read all this as a body until now, so, unsurprisingly, it is full of internal contradiction.”
Lord Taylor said that the process to cut the regulations would be similar to the changes made to the NPPF, which involved 1,200 pages being reduced to just 52. His 45-page report recommended that the guidance should be “whittled down to an essential, coherent, accessible and well-managed suite of guidance that aids the delivery of good planning”.
The report recommended that work starts immediately so that the guidance is updated by March 28, the first anniversary of the NPPF.
The end result will be a website that is “vastly shorter than 7,000 pages, a similar process to the NPPF, proportionately, 70 per cent or 80 per cent” smaller.
Lord Taylor conceded that the changes to the guidance would be “entirely neutral”, although he admitted “there will be some arguments about what they should say”, adding “what goes into it may or may not increase or reduce protection”.
The public and planning experts would be able to access the website to make the system more “accountable”, he said. One area which could cause a major row between campaigners and developers is forecasts for future housing needs. The report said that “guidance can and should clarify the 'ground rules’ for these processes, so there is clarity about approach … but guidance should support the application of local skills and judgment, not automate them”.
On Thursday night, Clive Betts, the Labour MP, who chairs the communities and local government committee, warned that smaller local planning authorities may rely too heavily on the guidance.
He said: “They have previously tried to weaken planning controls and we need to be very vigilant that it does not happen. The worry is that smaller planning authorities without expertise rely on this guidance to help them.
“What we need is a very thorough impact statement which would examine whether this would in practice weaken the planning guidance and controls that exist.”
Campaigners said that they were worried that Treasury officials might try to write an economic imperative through the guidance.
Shaun Spiers, the chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “Detail is all important in planning and we will be on high alert to ensure there are no unintended consequences for the countryside.”
Two consultations are planned into the changes. The first, which starts today, will seek views from the public on the principle of the changes. The review will then take place, and the public will be given the chance to comment on the changes in a second consultation.

Why propping up banks will not rescue a debauched financial system
Confession time. As 228 Representatives in Congress voted against Hank Paulson’s bail-out plan on Monday, I was cheering them on.
By Jeff Randall
10:43PM BST 30 Sep 2008
Comments
At last, there were public figures prepared to reject the political and financial blackmail of a debased White House-Wall Street elite. Previous

Barclays
Lloyds Banking Group
Royal Bank Of Scotland Group
This is an unfashionable view; it runs counter to The Daily Telegraph’s editorial line. But the hard-sell of President Bush and the US Treasury Secretary felt too much like the pressure patter of a door-to-door hawker. Their message was crude: “Trust us. You are in a terrible place. Only we can get you out of this mess. No need to check the details. Hurry now, or it will be too late. Here’s a pen. There’s the dotted line. Just sign.”
But with the President’s ratings so low, few would let him leave the House with anything more than small change. Congress asked, not unreasonably: “If you guys know so much about banking, how come we are in such trouble?”
Having spent most of the year telling America, contrary to mounting evidence, that the US economy was just dandy, Mr Bush’s credibility is threadbare. When making statements, he’s beginning to look as if he doesn’t even believe himself. As for Mr Paulson, his long association with the jackpot culture of Goldman Sachs is, in the eyes of many outsiders, a gilded millstone. Predictably, the refuseniks have been pilloried as ill-informed nihilists. They have been lambasted for failing to understand the consequences of their actions. They are, according to the Big Bail-out Brigade, condemning the rest of us to be buried alive in the rubble of a disintegrating banking system. Try a different take. Yes, the West’s financial infrastructure is in severe distress. Yes, more banks are going to crumble. Yes, there will be a recession. But allocating $700bn (it would almost certainly turn out to be more) to a clean-up programme for toxic assets, in effect socialising the poison of private greed, has no merit other than to delay the inevitable. No amount of federal cash can rewind the X-rated horror video. There is a conspiracy of bankers and politicians whose self-interest is masquerading as sophisticated policy. They want us to believe that they have the keys to salvation. I have not seen a scrap of evidence to confirm this. There will, of course, be a renewed effort in Washington to push through a package of national deliverance. Concessions will be made. The US taxpayer will be offered improved terms. And, having made their point, having stood up for “traditional American values”, some of the naysayers in the House of Representatives will cross over, enabling a deal to be done. Their consciences will be salved, but the crisis will not be solved. Meanwhile, in Britain, the ban on short-selling bank shares has done nothing to make them more attractive to investors. Having blamed hedge funds for driving down the price of supposedly healthy businesses, officials must be at a loss to explain why bank shares keep falling. Halifax-Bank of Scotland dropped another 14pc yesterday to 122p. There is now a yawning gap, about £3bn, between the offer made by Lloyds TSB and HBOS’s stock market capitalisation. This is the share price’s way of telling us that it doesn’t think the takeover is going to happen. Both boards insist the deal will go ahead, but shareholders may have other ideas. Which is a shame, because the creation of Lloyds-TSB-HBOS would help perform the much-needed service of consolidating a bloated industry, clearing out thousands of unwanted bankers, and ridding our high streets of too many branches. It baffles me that we’re closing Post Offices (2,500 out of 14,000 to go) and yet we have a multiplicity of banks. I recently visited Kingston-upon-Thames, where there is a blight of banks in the centre. On one street alone, there were five or six. I checked online and discovered that in this one wealthy town there are three Barclays, two HSBCs, plus branches of Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Cheltenham & Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester, Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds TSB, Co-operative Bank, Abbey, NatWest, Household Bank, and Beneficial Finance – I may have missed a couple. This, perhaps, will surprise you, but traditional banking – collecting retail deposits and making loans to ordinary customers – is barely profitable. Compared with the potential gains from a day at the currency-swap races, or a night in the derivatives casino, current accounts are cold potatoes. That is why bonus-hungry executives, at what we used to think of as boring banks, were so keen to spin the red-hot wheel of fortune. In these troubled times, protecting customers, especially depositors, is the right thing to do. The Government should extend the guarantee it has given to Northern Rock to all bank deposits. Beyond that, however, Britain’s over-banked economy needs a Malthusian cull. Update: David Goldsby accuses me below of failing to anticipate this crisis but in fact I have been predicting that things would go horribly wrong for some time, as this article shows.

Mugabe hunts for internet mole 'Baba Jukwa' revealing his secrets
President Robert Mugabe has reportedly offered a $300,000 reward to anyone who can unmask an anonymous whistleblower behind a string of leaks about alleged Zimbabwean government assassination plots, corruption and plans to rig this month’s election.

The well-informed mole, who calls himself “Baba Jukwa” and appears to be operating from within the heart of the regime, began posting revelations on a Facebook page four months ago.
The page has been viewed more than a million times and he has amassed more than 239,000 followers, with hundreds of responses and shares to every update. Efforts to track down the mole have so far failed. His postings have accused government ministers of corruption and senior police chiefs of brutality, publishing their private mobile phone numbers.
Reassuring government statements about 89-year-old Mr Mugabe’s health have been contradicted regularly, so infuriating the president that he offered the reward for exposing the mole – details of which were revealed by Baba Jukwa.
Determined attempts by senior Zanu-PF party officials to persuade Facebook to close the page failed and the president has now reportedly appealed to friends in the Chinese government for technical support to censor the site and identify its user.

The most unnerving postings by the mole — or moles, as seems more likely — were published last month and warned of an assassination plot against a former government minister who was suspected by Zanu-PF of leaking information.
Edward Chindori-Chininga was then killed in a car crash shortly after publicly criticising Zimabwe’s controversial diamond industry. “I told you there will be body bags coming this year... The war has begun,’’ Baba Jukwa posted on his wall after the politician’s death.
According to reports, the minister died when his car hit a tree, and no other vehicle was involved. Opponents of Mr Mugabe in the past have died in similar unexplained road accidents.
The advent of social media in Zimbabwe, which has dramatically influenced political events elsewhere in the world, is predicted to have a significant impact on elections due to be held on July 31.
Most access to the internet is via mobile phones, with more than six million users having direct access in a country with a population of 10 million.
Zimbabweans who follow Baba Jukwa – who signs each update with “Asijiki” which means “We do not retreat” in the local language Shona – say they now have unfettered access to information they have always wanted but were in fear of having.
Under the nation’s sweeping security laws, it is an offence to undermine the authority of the president and national security apparatus.
Nomatter Khumalo, a Zimbabwean based in the US, who follows Baba Jukwa’s updates, believes it would be too unsafe for the blogger to be based in Zimbabwe. Instead, he says, the mole probably lives abroad and draws on a network of informants, who are probably not even known to each other.
“We do not have Holy Cows any more in Zimbabwe,” he said. “From murders, diamond deals, torture camps, corruption, vote rigging, power struggles, internal thoughts and secrets, everything gets to be known. We feel like there are no more secrets, that we really can be free.”
Those who have been targeted by Baba Jukwa – which means father of Jukwa in Shona – have suffered. Savior Kasukuwere, the youth and empowerment minister, who was accused of involvement in state-sponsored political violence, admitted that he received at least 50 insulting phone calls a day and said his children also suffered.
“They go to school, and somebody is saying 'Baba Jukwa says your father does this and that’ – they are under emotional stress,” the minister said. World News

Mitt Romney can still win – and he deserves to
While Obama has suffered in televised debates, Mr Romney has become himself By Janet Daley
9:00PM GMT 03 Nov 2012
Comments
We were among the thousands who thronged JFK airport last Sunday night in the hope of escaping the omnistorm. It felt rather like clinging to the undercarriage of the final B52 to leave Saigon, but we made it. Then, from the haven of temperate London, we watched New York and poor, desperate New Jersey fill up with water and plunge into darkness. Friends on Long Island who could still manage to use email told us of their flooded homes and lost possessions. Much of lower Manhattan, as I write, remains effectively uninhabitable.
So where does this come on the scale of facts that will affect the presidential election? Almost nowhere. In spite of some rather tastelessly blatant wishful thinking in the Obama camp, this was not a great emotional turning point for the sitting president – mainly because the sitting president does not do emotion. If he did, he might well have benefited by becoming the consoling father of the nation, or at least the effective spokesman of its collective agony. He might have had as electrifying a spontaneous moment as the one George Bush had at Ground Zero when he shouted the country’s anger and defiance through a loudhailer: “The rest of the world hears you – and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.”
But he didn’t. He remained the cool, detached, self-regarding presence we have come to expect, reiterating his personal claim to the expeditious release of federal emergency funds, which is, in fact, no more than would be expected from any competent administration. His language and manner were too official, too quantified, too removed from any sense of trauma. In his first appearance at the Washington Red Cross headquarters, he actually uttered the sentence: “Unfortunately, we have had some fatalities.” Sounding like an insurance loss adjuster is not what America looks for in a national leader at moments such as this.
As he followed Governor Chris Christie around the scenes of devastation in New Jersey, the dissimilarity in their reactions was stunning. Mr Christie, born and bred in the state he now governs, was almost overwhelmed by personal grief. As a result, his tone was perfect – compassionate, genuinely involved, and moved, as he put it himself, beyond concern for party politics. The President did get photographed hugging one distraught woman, whom the Governor had earlier spent 10 minutes earnestly comforting – and the picture went round the world, facilitated by a helpful media. So no, this crisis did not alter the balance of this breathtakingly close presidential race. And the reason it didn’t – the failure of the incumbent president to rise to what the event demanded – is the key to Obama’s collapsing popularity and possibly the loss of his second term.
This was supposed to be a presidency of great thoughts and ideals. Obama was the big ideas guy: hope, change, the transformation of Washington, and a new post-racial, post-partisan politics. But whenever a moment came to go big, Obama went small. Instead of being larger than life, he repeatedly became bogged down in obstinate, technocratic detail. Instead of facing up to the historic enormity of the economic crisis, he became obsessed with ramming a very unpopular and expensive health care programme through Congress, thus destroying any possibility of bipartisan co-operation over the Budget (which remains frozen in futile gridlock). Instead of telling the truth as it was known over the Benghazi terror attack and its implications for Middle East policy, he and his White House evaded, denied, covered up – and smeared those who demanded answers and pointed out the contradictions. Instead of conveying wholehearted empathy with the victims of Hurricane Sandy, he offered a detailed list of facilities (water filtration equipment and “pre-position supplies”) that he was making available, leaving it to Governor Christie to speak of the sorrow that “won’t be permitted to replace resilience”.

Romney's push to win New Hampshire votes
03 Nov 2012
Where was the great orator? Was this the man who might have been expected to lift the spirits of a stricken community with a spellbinding statement like Franklin Roosevelt’s “We have nothing to fear but fear itself”, or even an unguarded display of genuine feeling as Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton would have produced? Was he lost without a script – as he seemed to be in that startling first debate with Mitt Romney? Or, indeed, in the second and third debates too – where again, he went small instead of big. The great themes that should have dominated his message and the entire campaign, considering that the United States is now in the throes of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, were lost in a morass of incomprehensible data and petulant retorts: technical minutiae and obscure debating points were thrown up like flak to conceal – what? The absence of any remaining big idea? Or the sense that his presidency, having exhausted all its political energy over Obamacare, had lost its way? Or that he is out of his depth on the economy?
But if Obama loses the White House, everyone – absolutely everyone – will attribute that fact to the fatal first presidential debate. And that will be largely right, not just because the President performed badly but because the public expectation of Mitt Romney was so dramatically contravened. Having been traduced and travestied by an Obama-worshipping mass media, Mr Romney simply became himself: reasonable, intelligent, obviously pleasant and impressively commanding of the argument. The electorate was not just bowled over with surprise, it was outraged by the misrepresentation of this man who had been depicted as half-monster, half-buffoon. American voters learnt an important truth not only about Mr Romney, but also about the systematic bias of the media – which would not regain the public trust again, and thus became worse than useless as cheerleader for the President. As one pundit put it, the media had “loved Obama to death”.
Like everybody with any sense, I am not going to make a prediction of the outcome. This one is truly too close to call. But I have two observations which may or may not prove pertinent. The first is that there could be a significant number of people intending to vote for Romney who, bullied by the liberal media, are not saying so to the opinion pollsters. And the second: I am sure that many Americans of good conscience voted for Obama in 2008 because they wished to exorcise the country’s hideous racial history. But having proved with that election that America is no longer a nation of bigots, they do not have to do it again. If they reject him now, they will be doing so on the basis of his record in office, not his race. He will have been judged as any president – of any colour – would have been. So if Mr Obama loses, it will not be the end of post-racial politics. It will be the beginning.

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini refused to publicly back Joe Hart after yet another error from the England goalkeeper saw Chelsea triumph at Stamford Bridge. The City No1 and Matija Nastasic were involved in a mix-up which gifted Fernando Torres a 90th-minute winner. Following the loss, Pellegrini refused to discuss the errors which resulted in Torres' winner or whether Hart's place is under threat from Costel Pantilimon. "I do it privately with the players," Pellegrini said when asked how he would assess Hart's contribution. After defeats at Cardiff and Aston Villa, the Chilean was left to rue the further loss of "stupid points" away from home. "We repeat the story," he said. "We had absolutely the control of the game. We played very, very well in the second half. We didn't have any problem with Chelsea but finally in the last minute we lost. Related Articles

"We are losing stupid points."
Pellegrini was incensed and at the final whistle refused to shake hands with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who celebrated the goal with supporters behind the visitors' dugout. Pellegrini said: "I didn't shake hands. I didn't want to shake hands."
Mourinho had no complaints with Pellegrini and insisted he entered the crowd to share his joy with his son, who has a season ticket. "I don't feel it is a lack of respect," Mourinho said. "If he was sad because of the result, I understand. If he was sad thinking that I was doing something wrong by going to celebrate there, I accept that too. No problem."
He added: "Chelsea is guilty. They have to give my kid tickets behind my dugout."
Mourinho was thrilled with Torres' response to his early miss. The £50-million frontman missed a sitter, set up Andre Schurrle's opener, hit the crossbar and then netted the decisive goal - his first Barclays Premier League goal of the season and second of 2013 - after Sergio Aguero's stunning equaliser. "When a striker misses an easy early chance, many times he's affected for the rest of the game," Mourinho said. "It looks like that moment was the moment where Fernando thought 'I will be the man of the match'. "The goal comes in a very intelligent action by Fernando. [A] misunderstanding by Joe and Nastasic, but Fernando was very clever. "He's sharp, he's powerful, the belief is high. We are happy for him, but we are all happy because it's a very important victory against a team we couldn't beat last year." Manchester City
