Viking descendants form a torchlight procession before sacrificing a longship at the annual Up Helly Aa festival in Lerwick, Shetland Islands. The festival, which began in 1870, celebrates the influence of the Scandinavian Vikings in the Shetland Islands. Shetland and neighbouring island Orkney were ruled by the Norse for about 500 years until they became part of Scotland in 1468.Picture: David Cheskin/PA

Russian residents buy up tinned goods and matches ahead of apocalypse Russian residents have been buying up cereals, tinned meat and boxes of matches in anticipation of the pending apocalypse. A Mayan priest performs a ritual in Yucatan, Mexico on Nov 19, 2012. The Mayan calendar predicts that Dec 21, 2012 will herald the end of the world.

3:37PM GMT 07 Dec 2012
In a widely reported – and derided – prediction, it has been claimed across the globe that the world will end on December 21 when the Mayan “long count” calendar comes to an end.
The head of a chain of hardware stores in Chita, Siberia, told reporters that demand had trebled the prices of candles. Some shopkeepers have taken a tongue-in-cheek approach, flogging "Meet the End of the World" kits which include a tot of vodka, a bar of soap, and a piece of rope. But others appear to be awaiting a genuine cataclysm. In Barnaul, close to the Altai Mountains, panic-buyers snapped up all the torches and Thermos flasks, while locals in Omutninsk in Kirov region rushed to buy kerosene and other supplies after an article supposedly written by a Tibetan monk appeared in the local paper confirming the prediction of a December 21 catastrophe. The industrial city of Novokuznetsk, meanwhile, has seen a run on salt and a disgruntled resident wrote to local authorities demanding they prepare themselves for the electricity cuts and looting which will surely accompany the planet's final moments.

The world may not end soon predicts newly found Mayan calendar
11 May 2012
The impending sense of doom spurred a group of MPs in Russia's lower house of parliament to write to the heads of federal television channels this week asking them not to disseminate "pseudoscientific information about the end of the world". In an editorial on Friday, the Moscow broadsheet Vedomosti said the atmosphere of unease reflected something deep in the Russian character. "Your average American will run for salt and matches only under the real threat of a storm or tornado, announced by the authorities for the next day. "Our Russian psychosis has two curious features. Firstly, that an 80 per cent Christian Orthodox society for some reason reacts to a Mayan calendar which no one has even seen. And secondly, that the end of the world is perceived as an economic crisis that can be survived on the banal level of consumption." Speaking in a live interview to five television channels on Friday, Prime Minister Dimtry Medvedev seized on a chance reference to the Mayan prediction to express his scepticism. "I don't believe in the end of the world," he said, before adding mysteriously: "At least, not this year." Russia

Connecticut school shooting: state's governor calls for action on gun control
Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy has spoken out against gun violence and called for a federal framework for gun control laws.
10:48PM GMT 17 Dec 2012
Mr Malloy joined a growing and increasingly urgent chorus of voices calling for stricter gun laws and a clampdown on the high-capacity magazines that allowed Adam Lanza to fire dozens of rounds without needing to reload. "These guns are not used to hunt deer," the Governor of Connecticut said. "I'm a big believer in hunting rights and a big believer in supporting the Second Amendment but there's a reality that this stuff has going too far and is too easy to own."
He said that the high-capacity magazines were "extremely dangerous" and that laws limiting rifle clips to 10 rounds could have made a "significant" difference in limiting the scale of the massacre. Although Connecticut has stricter gun laws than many other states, Mr Malloy said "that no state would ever be safe" until national limits were in place because weapons move so easily across state lines. "Do I think Washington DC needs to get its act together and enact stricter gun control laws at the federal level? You bet I do."

The governor briefly wept as he described his decision to end parents' false hope that their children might still emerge from the school alive. "I made the decision that to have that go on any longer was wrong," he said. "You try to feel their pain but you can't. You try to find some words that you hope will be adequate, knowing that they will be inadequate and you see little coffins and your heart has to break," he said. Mr Malloy said he was calling for a statewide moment of silence on Friday morning, when 26 bells would toll to mark the 26 dead at the school. USA
