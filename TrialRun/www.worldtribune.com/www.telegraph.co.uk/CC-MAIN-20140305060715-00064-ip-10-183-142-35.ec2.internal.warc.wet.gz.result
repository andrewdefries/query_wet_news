The euro crisis also provides some opportunities for the UK

As it chews towards its destination, it is further opening up the important channels of communication that exist between Britain and Europe.
At the end of last year she was joined by eight other giant boring machines, including Ada and Phyllis toiling in the west, Elizabeth and Victoria devouring underground in the east, and Sophia working quietly in the south.
As these machines tunnel their way underneath London, they are carving out the essential new infrastructure that so many investors around the world cite as being key to capital confidence and investing in Britain.
It’s not just the engineering and construction industries that make us great as a nation, but our services industry, too. As the British leader of a global professional services business with connections into the emerging markets, our offices up and down the country provide a global gateway for our clients who are looking to expand overseas and attract foreign investment.
Harnessing British business, our infrastructure, people and their important skills, will be at the forefront of international finance leaders and chief executives’ minds this Thursday at the annual Global Investment Conference (GIC), hosted by the UK Government.

02 May 2013
The guests at GIC, one of Britain’s biggest business summits, will discuss how we can boost business investment and global economic growth, while showcasing Britain’s attractions as a world leading destination for investment.
When I address the summit, my message will be that Britain has made some exceptional progress in the past few years in improving its standing as a destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).
According to the latest annual Ernst & Young (EY) European Investment Monitor, Britain has been the leading country in Europe for FDI both for the numbers of projects and for the amount of employment for the past 10 years.
This is a remarkable testament to the openness and international orientation of the British economy.
Our country’s ability to win vital investment has been a crucial source of pride, job creation and growth over many years.
But now we have a real fight on our hands if we wish to retain our coveted decade-long lead as the number one European investment destination for FDI.
In 2011 the number of projects into Britain actually fell by 4pc, with total projects in Europe rising 7pc.
And the gap between Britain and its peers, especially the powerhouse of Germany, has been narrowing year-on-year.
It is clear that as the world recovers from the worst financial crisis in a generation, the international environment has become more uncertain.
Recent British economic data tell us that we have performed poorly in our European export markets.
The EY ITEM Club has predicted that Britain would have to wait until 2015 before exported produce started contributing positively to economic growth.
The trend has been exacerbated by weak demand from Europe, which continues to be one of our strongest trading partners.
Competitive pressure on Britain is clearly intensifying.
But I remain confident that Britain can and will retain its leading position in Europe. There are numerous reasons for this, including real progress on the British ambition to become one of the most competitive corporate tax regimes in the G20.
I know of more than 40 multinational companies, for example, that have been looking to undertake global and regional headquarter relocations into Britain.
They have the potential to bring £1bn of additional annual tax revenues and more than 2,000 high value senior management jobs to the country.
The euro crisis also provides some opportunities for the UK, with investments appearing lower risk than in the eurozone and fiscally stressed euro states starting to invest more overseas to avoid troubles at home.
This situation presents openings for us to sell our advantages as an FDI location to investors in Europe and beyond.
The debate about Britain’s membership of the European Union (EU) has been cited by many commentators as a potentially significant factor in future business investment decisions.
Yet, what I’m hearing in the market is that renegotiating our relationship with the EU would actually have little negative impact on foreign investment decisions into the UK.
In an EY survey of 300 investors from around the world – to be released in June – we asked their reaction to Britain moving to a renegotiated and looser relationship with the EU. The difference in investor attitudes across the world was really quite surprising.
Only 36pc of investors from western Europe said reduced integration with the EU would make the UK more attractive as an FDI location.
However, both North American and Asian investors were much more positive about the opportunity.
Some 72pc of US and 66pc of Asian investors said that a renegotiated relationship would actually improve the attractiveness of Britain as an FDI location.
No doubt this will be a major topic of discussion on Thursday. Whatever the outcome of a potential referendum on UK/EU relations, British business must stay the course.
Britain, as the recent campaign said, is GREAT.
It is open for business and we have a lot to be proud of.
Anyone seeking to challenge our leading position in the global race may just have Annie to contend with.
Steve Varley is the UK chairman and UK & Ireland managing partner of Ernst & Young

Jonathan Ross docked £1.4m and given final warning by BBC for Russell Brand radio prank
Jonathan Ross has been docked £1.4 million in pay and issued with a "final warning" by the BBC’s director-general, Mark Thompson, as punishment for the obscene phone calls made to Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs on Russell Brand's radio show. Image 1 of 3	Jonathan Ross has been suspended by the BBC and Russell Brand has quit over their obscene phone calls to actor Andrew Sachs.

10:30PM GMT 30 Oct 2008
In an unprecedented move, the corporation announced it was to suspend its star presenter for 12 weeks, and he would not be paid his £16,000-a-day wages. But while Ross clung on to his record £18 million three-year contract, Lesley Douglas, the controller of Radio 2, was forced out of her job. Following an emergency meeting of the BBC Trust, Miss Douglas announced that she was resigning her post after four years, admitting that she was ultimately responsible for allowing the offending material to be broadcast. The Daily Telegraph understands that Mr Thompson and the trust were privately furious over Miss Douglas’s failure to contain the crisis. They also blamed her for failing to "manage the risk" that was Brand, who joined Ross in making the prank call to Mr Sachs. They were broadcast on Brand’s Saturday night Radio 2 programme on Oct 18.

30 Oct 2008
Mr Thompson finally took decisive action after a day of crisis meetings with the trust, bowing to mounting public and political pressure by suspending Ross from all broadcasting duties. His Saturday morning Radio 2 show and his two BBC1 programmes – Friday Night With Jonathan Ross and Film 2008 – will be removed from the schedules. "I believe in this case Jonathan absolutely overstepped the mark," Mr Thompson said. "It doesn’t mean in the future that Jonathan can’t continue his broadcasting for the BBC. But I have to say, I think he and everyone else should regard this as a final warning."
His comments leave a question mark over whether Ross will return after his three-month hiatus. The 47-year-old presenter has made innuendo and risque humour his trademark, and the fear of further censure could lead him to walk away from the corporation. The director-general added: "The ultimate editorial responsibility for BBC programmes lies with producers and editorial managers. The consequences of errors of judgment are therefore more serious for managers. Nonetheless, Jonathan Ross’s contribution to this edition of the Russell Brand Show was utterly unacceptable and cannot be allowed to go uncensured or without sanction. "A 12-week suspension is an exceptional step, but I believe it is a proportionate response to Jonathan’s role in this unhappy affair. "Jonathan Ross has already made a comprehensive and unreserved personal apology to Andrew Sachs and his granddaughter. I believe that he fully understands the seriousness of what has happened."
He added: "We agree that nothing like this must ever happen again and that tight discipline will be required for the future."
The chairman of the BBC Trust, Sir Michael Lyons, ordered Mr Thompson back from his Mediterranean holiday to deal with the fallout, and is said to be incensed that the debacle has dragged on for days. The number of complaints received stands at more than 35,000. Sir Michael said: "The transmission of these comments via a BBC radio programme represents an abuse of the privilege given to the BBC to broadcast to its audiences."
The trust has demanded that the BBC management broadcast an apology to licence fee payers on Radio 2 for what it called "serious and deliberate breaches" of the editorial code. It has also instructed Mr Thompson to write a personal apology to Mr Sachs and his granddaughter, Georgina Baillie, for the "deplorable intrusion". In their calls, Ross and Brand left a series of lewd messages on Mr Sachs’s answering machine, claiming that Brand had slept with Miss Baillie. Brand announced on Wednesday that he was quitting his £200,000-a-year show, and Miss Douglas followed yesterday. In her resignation letter to Mr Thompson, Miss Douglas said she took the decision to step down "with enormous regret" but stressed: "This is my decision alone."
She wrote: "The events of the last two weeks happened on my watch. I believe it is right to take responsibility for what has happened. It is a matter of the greatest possible sadness to me that a programme on my network has been the cause of such a controversy." She offered a personal apology to Mr Sachs and his family. Her resignation comes 12 months after the BBC1 controller, Peter Fincham, was forced from his job over "Queengate", in which a trailer was wrongly edited as if to show the Queen walking out of a photoshoot "in a huff". Critics said the BBC’s slow response to the Ross row showed that the regulatory system, overhauled in the wake of the Hutton inquiry and fakery row, remains flawed. Ross was unavailable for comment.

British climber falls 2,000ft to his death A British climber fell to his death in New Zealand after telling his family he was “living the dream”.
Robert Buckley had told his family he was "living the dream" Photo: FACEBOOK	By Rosa Silverman
4:35PM BST 16 Sep 2013
Follow Robert Buckley, 31, tumbled about 2,000 feet while climbing to a small hut on Mount Sefton in the Aoraki-Mt Cook National Park in snowy and icy conditions on Saturday. He was wearing crampons but was inexperienced and insufficiently equipped, police said. Mr Buckley, who was originally from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, lived in Christchurch and had spent three years travelling the world. He was with three climbers from Britain and Ireland when he fell after slipping on ice. His body was recovered by a team of rescuers yesterday afternoon after attempts to do so on Saturday were unsuccessful. Related Articles

His mother Jill Ray, 58, described him as a “loving son and brother” and said the family was “devastated” by his death. She had been looking forward to seeing him at Christmas, when she was due to meet up with him in Thailand, she added. “He always used to say, ‘Mum, I’m living the dream,” she told the London Evening Standard. “He travelled so much and had hundreds of friends around the world.”
Mr Buckley leaves behind his younger sister Kate, 23, and brother Alex, 28, as well. His father died unexpectedly last year. Kate posted a string of kisses on his Facebook page today, while friends also paid tribute to him on the site. John Cruikshank, who attended Shoeburyness High School with Mr Buckley, wrote: “Wish I had half the get up and go of Rob, 100% lived his life to its full x.”
Another school friend, Sam Bundock, wrote: “Top bloke may not be travelling this world but def is somewhere else now be missed mate.”
The other climbers Mr Buckley was with were rescued yesterday after spending the night on the mountain. They were released after an examination by medical staff. Police inspector Dave Gaskin said: "There was a lot of snow and ice in very steep conditions. "It appears as if the party were insufficiently equipped and inexperienced for the climb they had undertaken." Mr Buckley's death came a day after 36-year-old Duncan Rait died after slipping and falling about 200 feet from a ridge in the same national park. The New Zealand-born man, who lived in Australia, had been dropped off by helicopter and was walking to a hut when he fell in the Tasman Glacier area. Mr Gaskin said the deaths were a reminder that climbers needed to use extreme caution. “I can’t speak for the first death, but in this case it looks like to be a lack of experience," he said.

FA chairman David Bernstein ready to deal with football's 'bad guys' and invoke spirit of 2012
From Fabio Capello’s departure to Roy Hodgson’s appointment, Luis Suárez’s ban to John Terry’s current charge, many of the Football Association’s most momentous events in the past year must be seen through the prism of David Bernstein’s moral crusade.

6:30AM BST 25 Sep 2012
Follow A sheriff in a suit, the FA chairman has been determined to bring order to the Wild West of English football. Capello left because Bernstein did not want Terry to enjoy the honour of the England armband at a time when he was embroiled in a dispute over alleged racism. Hodgson was brought in for his footballing credentials and also because Bernstein trusts him. The disciplinary tribunal that found Suárez guilty was independent but echoed the desire for high standards in the age of Bernstein. There is always a feeling with the FA chairman of his wondering: ''How will this be viewed down at the golf club?’’ Related Articles

Terry found himself caught in the perfect storm of a campaigning chairman, a public increasingly disenchanted with underachieving England footballers and the censorious shadow cast by the Olympics. London 2012 strengthened Bernstein’s evangelical zeal. As the new season opened, he urged players to improve their behaviour, cut out dissent to officials, moderate on-field language to each other and please, please try to be role models, drawing on the “sporting spirit we have seen at the Olympic Games”. Players have been warned. Bernstein’s mission statement is clear: behave, be responsible. When called to debate football governance by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Bernstein detailed where his priorities lay. As an accountant, he acknowledged the importance of sensible, sustainable financial planning for clubs and his own organisation. Determined to clean up the game, Bernstein also spoke of offering “moral leadership” and taking “the high ground”. In robust health, Bernstein reaches the FA statutory retirement age of 70 next May. Such is the admiration within football for Bernstein’s moral crusade that he will be given an extension, probably taking him until the end of the 2014 World Cup. It is no time to be leaving the FA with a 150th birthday to celebrate next year. More immediately, Bernstein will soon be involved in the official opening of St George’s Park, he has Dan Ashworth arriving from West Bromwich Albion to guide the elite technical reforms and he really enjoys Hodgson’s company. He could take Hodgson down the golf club and the members would love him. Bernstein is a man who genuinely wants to do good. Walking along the touchline at Villa Park before the FA Community Shield, he took particular pride in being applauded by the Manchester City fans. They remember his crucial work as their chairman, steering the club through difficult times. There are certain concerns with Bernstein’s stewardship. For someone so strong on principles and a committed family man, Bernstein was caught out badly by the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s report. The FA’s response was sluggish and inadequate, confirming long-established fears on Merseyside about the governing body. Initially, there was no apology from the organisation that cleared the game to go ahead in a stadium without a safety certificate. Eventually sensing the families’ understandable ire, Bernstein recorded an interview in which he emphasised the governing body was “deeply sorry this tragedy occurred at a stadium the FA selected’’. It was partly damage limitation, partly the reaction of a decent man who realised the FA had erred. Certain previous chairmen would not have responded. A further issue is that the pressing need for money to cope with Wembley, St George’s and grass-roots developments has seen the FA increasingly in thrall to broadcasters. The 5.15 pm FA Cup final kick-off tramples on tradition and mocks fans from the North reliant on trains. Bernstein is clearly a corporate man as well as a moral man. England
