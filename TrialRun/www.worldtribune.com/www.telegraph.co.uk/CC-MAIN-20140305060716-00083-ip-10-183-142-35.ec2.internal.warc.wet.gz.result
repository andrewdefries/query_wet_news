CVC set to return with higher offer for Betfair
A consortium led by CVC Capital Partners is poised to return with an offer slightly less than £10 a share for gambling exchange Betfair.

The private equity group, which is working with two major Betfair shareholders — Richard Koch and Antony Ball — is understood to have sounded out investors over a revised approach ahead of a takeover panel deadline at 5pm on Monday.
It is believed the new offer, which would value the company close to £1bn, could be tabled to Betfair’s board as early as Sunday. But sources this weekend stressed that conversations were still ongoing and that a final decision had not been made.
It is believed CVC, the owner of Formula 1, will come back with a sweetened proposal, above last month’s 880p-a-share approach, in order to gain access to Betfair’s books.
However, the new price is expected to be short of the £10 a share analysts say CVC will have to pay out to be in with a shot of succeeding in its offer.

CVC in talks over Betfair takeover bid

One top-10 shareholder suggested on Saturday night CVC may tell Betfair it is not prepared to dramatically raise its offer unless it is allowed access to the company’s books.
Betfair’s board, led by City veteran Gerald Corbett, the former Railtrack chief and chairman of Woolworths, could, in theory, give the consortium access to its books without recommending an offer. The company, which was founded in 2000 by one-time professional gambler Andrew Black and former JP Morgan trader Edward Wray, both still major shareholders, last month rejected CVC’s £912m preliminary offer, saying it “fundamentally undervalues the company and its attractive prospects”.
Betfair’s chief executive, Breon Corcoran, used a trading update last Tuesday to set out the firm’s defence, which included increasing expected cost savings from £20m to £30m and raising full-year revenue forecasts to £387m, up from previous guidance of £370m-£385m.
Mr Corcoran, who joined last summer from Paddy Power, admitted the CVC bid had forced the betting exchange to show “a bit more leg than we might have liked to”, as he seeks to turn the business around.
The group has axed around 500 staff and has withdrawn from markets such as Cyprus, Germany and Greece, where there is unstable online betting regulation.
Ivor Jones, analyst at Numis Securities, raised his target price to £11 a share, from £10, following Tuesday’s presentation. He said the group’s share price was “reasonably well insulated from the disappointment of a bid not emerging”.
A number of institutional investors are understood to have built up stakes in Betfair last week — suggesting the market believes a takeover bid may not come off. CVC, which has been talking to shareholders since Tuesday’s update, declined to comment. It is understood the private equity group was taken by surprise when news it was in talks over a potential bid leaked out last month. The consortium has the option of asking the Takeover Panel for an extension to the deadline.
Key to any potential deal will be Mr Wray and Mr Black, who between them still hold about 19pc of the shares. Last month Mr Wray backed the board’s rejection of CVC’s bid and expressed support for the group’s new chief executive, saying: “I think Breon is doing a good job.”
Mr Koch is one of Betfair’s early backers and a former management consultant. He has a 6pc stake, despite selling almost a quarter of his shares in 2004 to Japan’s Softbank, a deal that made him £27m before tax. Mr Ball is a non-executive director at Luxembourg-listed investment group Brait. Betfair’s exchange allows customers to bet against one another, while the group takes a commission.

Our conscience is clear over tax and profits, says Thames Water
Britain's biggest water company Thames Water has declared its conscience “absolutely clear”, after Ofwat chairman Jonson Cox claimed some utilities’ profits and tax-reducing corporate structures were “morally questionable”. Ofwat has already asked water companies to look at ways of sharing windfall gains with consumers. Photo: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Telegraph	By Emily Gosden

Privately-owned Thames, which serves 14m customers across London and the south of England, paid no corporation tax this year and has faced criticism by MPs and campaigners over its tax arrangements. Speaking as the company unveiled a plunge in annual profits, Stuart Siddall, Thames Water finance director denied that the company was avoiding paying tax and said: “We have an absolutely clear conscience about everything we are doing. "Everything is transparent. We are reviewed by HMRC every year as a major corporation and we are seen as low-risk because our tax is very straightforward."
In the year to March 2013 Thames’s pre-tax profits fell 35pc to £144.9m owing to bad weather, unpaid customer bills and rising energy costs. The company booked a £5.1m tax credit and said that although it paid no corporation tax it paid business rates and other taxes which amounted to about £150m. The company said: “We have not paid much corporation tax in recent years because the Government’s tax system allows us to delay, not avoid, payment of tax based on how much we invest. Because we are investing £1bn a year from 2010 to 2015, more than any water firm in the UK’s history, we are able to defer a lot of tax payments to future years.”

Writing in the Telegraph today Mr Cox said that some water companies’ use of high-coupon loans to shareholders to reduce their tax liability was “morally questionable” and noted criticism of “complex offshore holding structures”. He said companies must share windfall returns with consumers and pledged to “lift the veil” on corporate practices, claiming he was yet to find an unlisted water company that fully complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code “or satisfactorily explains why not”. Mr Siddall said Thames had taken further steps to make sure its accounts were "very transparent" and gave "good reasons" for not complying with parts of the code over the number of non-executive directors on its board. "[Mr Cox] won't have seen our accounts today but I think if he reads our accounts he will find that everywhere we have either complied or explained," he said. "We haven’t left a stone unturned in making sure we have done that.”
Defending its profits, Mr Siddall said: "We need to make a sensible return because we have to service our debt and attract equity into the business. Our return this year was 4.31pc which is below what was determined by Ofwat."
Thames Water said its shareholders bore the £17m costs of drought and flooding and were "exposed to these risks so our customers do not have to be". Thames Water’s accounts show it paid £231.4m in dividends to parent company Kemble Water Holdings, down from £279.5m, due to the “dip in financial performance”. It paid £92m to its ultimate shareholders, which include funds from Australia, China, Abu Dhabi and Britain, down from £200m last year after paying no distribution in the second half of the year. Of that £92m, £74.5m was paid as a dividend, after tax, while £17.5m was paid as interest on an 11pc-rate Eurobond loan to its shareholders. “That would be tax deductible in our books but our shareholders would pay tax on that," Mr Siddall said. "It is only £17.5m. It's effectively a proxy for dividends; if they didn't have that they would receive dividends. It's part of the corporate structure and whoever receive that interest will pay tax on it."
Thames Water’s accounts also show it paid £328.2m interest on “intercompany loans”, which Mr Siddall said was paid via a Cayman Islands funding vehicle to its external bondholders such as pension funds. However, he said the funding vehicle was “registered in the UK for tax” and there was “no tax advantage” as a result. “The Cayman Island companies are there purely to comply with UK company law requirements for the acquisition financing structure,” he said.
