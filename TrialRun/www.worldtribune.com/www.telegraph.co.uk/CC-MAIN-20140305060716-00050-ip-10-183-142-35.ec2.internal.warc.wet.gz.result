Michael Jackson: key facts about the singer's life
Michael Jackson, 50, one of pop music's biggest stars, is reported to have died after suffering a cardiac arrest in Los Angeles on Thursday. Image 1 of 2	Michael Jackson has died, according to reports Photo: SPLASH NEWS	Image 1 of 2	Michael Jackson has died, according to reports Photo: AP	11:55PM BST 25 Jun 2009
Comments
The TMZ website, which broke the story he had been taken to hospital, were first to post rumours of Michael Jackson's death. The LA Times, Associated Press, BBC and Press Association all later reported Jackson has died.
However, there has not yet been official confirmation, and spokesmen for Jackson could not be reached for comment.
Here are some key facts about Jackson:
EARLY LIFE:
* Jackson was born on Aug. 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, the seventh of nine children. Five Jackson boys – Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael – first performed together at a talent show when Michael was 6. They walked off with first prize.

26 Jun 2009
* Their group later became The Jackson Five, and when it was signed by Motown Records in the late 1960s it underwent its final metamorphosis to become The Jackson 5. Jackson made his first solo album in 1972.
SUCCESS:
* Jackson released "Thriller" in 1982, which became a smash hit that yielded seven top-ten singles. The album sold 21 million copies in the United States and at least 27 million worldwide.
* The next year, he unveiled his signature "moonwalk" dance move while performing "Billie Jean" during an NBC special.
* Jackson's lifetime record sales tally is believed to be about 750 million, which, added to the 13 Grammy Awards he has received, makes him one of the most successful entertainers of all time.
ACCUSATIONS:
* In 1993, Jackson was accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy, and police raided his California ranch "Neverland."
* The same year, Jackson announced he had become addicted to painkillers and abruptly cancelled a world tour to promote his album, "Dangerous."
* He reached a settlement in 1994, later reported to be $23 million, with the family of the boy he was accused of abusing.
MARRIAGE & FAMILY:
* In 1994, Jackson married Elvis Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1996. Jackson married Debbie Rowe the same year and had two children, before splitting in 1999. The couple never lived together.
* Jackson has three children named Prince Michael I, Paris Michael and Prince Michael II, known for his brief public appearance when his father held him over the railing of a hotel balcony, causing widespread criticism.
MORE CONTROVERSY:
* A television documentary "Living with Michael Jackson" was aired in 2003, saying that Jackson still had sleepovers with young boys and had his third child with a surrogate mother. Jackson aired his own rebuttal.
* Jackson went on trial in 2005 on charges of molesting a 13-year-old boy in 2003, as well as conspiring to abduct the boy. The singer faced nearly 20 years in prison if convicted.
* The four-month trial ended in June 2005 with his being acquitted of all charges. Jackson has spent time in Bahrain, Ireland and France since the child molestation case ended.
COMEBACK?
* After several false dawns, Jackson and music promoter AEG Live announced he would perform 50 concerts at London's O2 Arena. Jackson had been due to start the concerts on July 13. Jackson had been rehearsing in the Los Angeles area for the London shows, which sold out within hours of within hours of going on sale in March.

Blow for George Osborne as Tory council chiefs oppose fracking in Chancellor’s constituency
Cheshire East council leader says it will remain "fracking free" while Cheshire West and Chester leader says he is unlikely to support fracking unless cash benefits are increased

George Osborne's hopes of a British shale gas boom have been dealt a blow after Tory council chiefs indicated they would oppose fracking in the Chancellor’s own shale-rich Tatton constituency. Mr Osborne has been the government’s most vocal advocate of fracking, which he believes can lower energy bills and create thousands of jobs. Maps published by the British Geological Survey last year show the entire area covered by the Tatton constituency as being highly prospective for shale gas. But Cheshire East council, which covers the majority of the Tatton, has declared it will remain “fracking-free”, while the leader of Cheshire West and Chester council, which covers the remainder of the seat, said he “wouldn’t be minded to support” fracking unless cash benefits for communities were increased. The comments are a setback for the Chancellor, who has brought forward tax breaks for fracking firms and said he would "love fracking to get going in the UK" and was "doing absolutely everything" he could to encourage it.

In a statement this week Cllr Michael Jones, leader of Cheshire East council, said: “Fracking may well be a useful technology for other areas and good luck to them if it is, however the people of Cheshire East have our assurance that there won’t be any in our borough.”
He told the Telegraph he was not “against fracking as a concept” but did not support it at the moment because he believed much of the area was better suited to geothermal energy which, unlike fracking, “doesn’t use chemicals as much” and so “clearly could be a much more preferable and green way of doing it”. He suggested the only areas that were prospective for shale gas in Cheshire East were in green belt land. Meanwhile Cllr Mike Jones (no relation), leader of Cheshire West and Chester council, told the Telegraph that he “wouldn’t be minded to support” fracking in the area unless cash benefits for communities were increased and more done to demonstrate the safety of the process. Mr Jones is a senior figure in the Local Government Association, which has demanded communities are given a legally-enshrined right to a 10pc share of shale gas revenues. He said the current 1pc offer from the industry was “derisory”, adding: “If the revenue share is increased I would be much more minded to support it.”
Mr Jones said that every planning application had to be taken on its merits but as things stood: “I don’t think we can carry residents and elected members to support applications if people don't see they have got a fair deal out of it." He said he did believe shale gas could have potential to help deliver lower energy costs for major industry in his area but that his support was conditional on "safety for people and safety for the environment" as well as community benefits. Cllr Jones of Cheshire West and Chester is one of five north-west council leaders who, along with seven MPs, wrote to the Prime Minister this week warning that “without some significant retention of revenues… we would find it difficult to support further development” of shale gas. An aide to Mr Osborne said: "George is one of the biggest supporters of fracking for the jobs and growth and investment and lower energy bills it brings. He has no problems with it taking place in his constituencies at all."

Glencore to raise $11bn in joint London, Hong Kong float
Glencore, one of the world's leading commodities traders, plans to raise up to $11bn (£67bn) in a joint London and Hong Kong flotation that will create 485 millionaires. The proceeds will go toward increasing Glencore's 50.7pc stake in Kazakh zinc miner Kazzinc, to pay off debt, and to fund investment projects. Photo: AFP	11:41AM BST 14 Apr 2011
Comments
The Swiss-based group said in an intention to float document that it is looking to sell between 15pc and 20pc of its equity. This would value it at up to $60bn (£37bn), making it potentially one of the largest stock market listings in history. Glencore plans to use the cash raised to increase Glencore's 50.7pc stake in Kazakh zinc miner Kazzinc, to pay off debt, and to fund a range of capital investment projects over the next three years. Over the month the company has been closely monitoring events in the Middle East and Japan before deciding to launch the listing process. The listing comes as commodity prices trade at record-high, although prices have fallen after Goldman Sachs' commodity team called time on one of its major trades. Commodities traders read this as the investment bank calling a temporary top in commodities. Related Articles

The trader is currently owned by its 485 partners, who will each end up with shares worth an average of just over $100m. Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore, who owns a 15pc stake in the company, will become one of the world's richest men if the business achieves the valuation it is looking for. Glencore has announced that Simon Murray, South Pole adventurer and former Vodafone Group board member, will be chairman.
Other board members include former BP chief executive Tony Hayward, who takes on the role of senior independent director. The initial public offering is being handled by investment banks Morgan Stanley, Citi, Credit Suisse, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Barclays Capital, Societe Generale, UBS and Liberum Capital. Glencore employs approximately 54,800 people in more than 30 countries. A further 2,700 people are employed in Glencore’s marketing operations, in a global network of more than 50 offices in over 40 countries. Commodities

Personal insolvencies hit record of 134,000 in 2009
A record number of people in England and Wales were declared insolvent during 2009, new figures have shown. According to the Insolvency Service a total of 134,142 people went bankrupt during the year Photo: PHOTOLIBRARY	By Richard Evans

A total of 134,142 people went bankrupt or took out an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) or Debt Relief Order during the year, according to the Insolvency Service. This figure is equivalent to about one in every 320 adults or 0.31pc. The figure dwarfed the previous record of 107,288 personal insolvencies set in 2006, with insolvency practitioners estimating this level had already been passed by October last year. The 134,142 insolvencies in 2009 comprised 74,670 bankruptcies (which were up by 10.7pc on 2008), 47,641 IVAs (a rise of 21.8pc) and 11,831 DROs. In the fourth quarter of 2009 there were 35,574 individual insolvencies in England and Wales. This was an increase of 24.9pc on the same period a year previously. This figure consisted of 17,007 bankruptcies (which were down 5.5pc on the corresponding quarter of the previous year), 13,219 IVAs (a rise of 26.3pc on the previous year) and 5,348 DROs. The DRO is a new individual insolvency procedure which came into force on April 6 2009 and provides an alternative route into personal insolvency for certain categories of over-indebted individuals.

IVAs: Your questions answered
01 Aug 2008
The Insolvency Service said: "Some of those who had a DRO approved would have been declared bankrupt had the DRO route not been an option, but it is not possible to quantify this proportion."
It added: "In 2009, 85.4pc of bankruptcies were made on the petition of the debtor, up marginally from 83.9pc in 2008. For bankruptcy orders there has been a pronounced shift towards debtor’s petition bankruptcies and away from creditor’s petitions in recent years."
Chris Nutting, director of personal insolvency at KPMG, the accountancy firm, said: “Our research shows that over 223 people a day are choosing to petition for their own bankruptcy. The figures show that there are still many people experiencing serious financial difficulties, despite record low interest rates. “While Britain is technically out of recession, the harsh reality is that many people are still living beyond their means. Lessons from history show that personal insolvencies will continue to rise after the recession finally ends and for some time to come." He added: "If, as predicted, there are rises in tax and reductions in public sector spending, a lot of people will need to take drastic action to resolve their financial problems, such as applying for bankruptcy.”
Alan Tomlinson, a partner at Tomlinsons, the insolvency practitioners, said: "The substantial increase in IVAs shows that many people are trying to work their way through the recession rather than go down the bankruptcy route. They cannot realise equity from their homes and so are turning to an IVA, which gives them much-needed breathing space. He added: "For many people struggling with their debts, the final straw could come when interest rates rise. Many people have survived this far into the recession because their mortgage payments have been lower, but once these go up they could be in trouble. "The monthly interest rate meeting of the Bank of England is hanging over people like the Sword of Damocles."

Two-tier A&E as 100 units cut care
At least 100 A&E departments will offer reduced levels of service and patients will have to travel further for expert treatment under a shake-up of NHS casualty departments
Senior doctors say that the present A & E system is on the brink of collapse, adding that last winter many casualty units became like “warzones” as they struggled to cope with demand Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Laura Donnelly, Health Correspondent

At least 100 accident and emergency units will offer reduced levels of service and patients will have to travel further for expert treatment under the biggest shake-up of NHS casualty departments in 40 years. A new two-tier system of A&E departments is the only way to keep a safe health service which is free at the point of use, officials claim. Under the system up to 70 of England’s 170 casualty units will be designated as “major emergency centres” which treat the most serious conditions and injuries. The remainder will deal only with less serious injuries. The plan will also attempt to ease the burden on A&E by keeping patients who do not need emergency treatment away from hospitals. The reorganisation comes amid fears that this winter will put unprecedented strain on England’s A&E units. Related Articles

12 Nov 2013
Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, said the system was under “intense, growing and unsustainable pressure” from an ageing population and high numbers turning to casualty departments because of widespread confusion about where else to go. Under his plans, thousands of patients who suffer heart attacks and strokes will travel further by ambulance in order to access specialist care, which he says cannot be safely provided alongside every casualty unit. Officials said the remaining A&E units would care for the vast majority of emergencies, such as broken limbs, blackouts and abdominal pain, with the intention that those patients could be seen quicker. Despite travelling longer distances, patients with more serious conditions, including severely ill children, would receive better care in the new “major emergency centres”. The changes in NHS urgent and emergency care call for “a fundamental shift in how and where” patients are treated, within three to five years, to relieve pressure on hospitals, amid fears that the system cannot cope with rising demand. A spokesman for NHS England said: "Bruce Keogh specifically rejected the idea that there would be cuts in accident and emergency departments. His aim was to properly reflect the reality of emergency care now and provide a blueprint for a network of care in the future. "He is not proposing any downgrading but believes after this process the overall number of emergency care centres will remain broadly the same."
Senior doctors say that the present system is on the brink of collapse, adding that last winter many casualty units became like “warzones” as they struggled to cope with demand. The NHS proposals, published on Wednesday, include same-day access to family doctors for routine health problems seven days a week, and GP telephone appointments. The report also calls for extended training for paramedics to keep more patients out of hospital, with evidence suggesting that up to half of 999 calls could be managed at the scene. Under the plans, the controversial 111 phoneline would have a central role in managing demand for urgent care. Senior NHS officials said that despite problems which have dogged the non-emergency telephone line, which collapsed in some parts of the country when it was introduced earlier this year, an “enhanced” version of the service would help improve care. In future, call centres will have more medical staff on hand, and staff will be able to access electronic patient records so that advice was better tailored, they said. Sir Bruce said that a transformation of the whole system of urgent care was “the only way to create a sustainable solution — and ensure future generations can have peace of mind that, when the unexpected happens, the NHS will still provide a rapid, high quality and responsive service free at the point of need”. He said the NHS needed to acknowledge that A&Es are all not of equal quality — with one in seven operating without intensive care departments and one in five without a paediatric department. Officials said the current system of A&E departments had not been reviewed since the Seventies, when heart attacks were treated with bed rest, with one in four dying. Today, advances in cardiology have reduced death rates to five per cent. Sir Bruce insisted the changes would not mean closures of A&E departments, with “no degradation” of the service currently provided at casualty units. Under the plans, standard emergency departments that receive cases requiring specialised care would be expected to be able to stabilise patients, before transferring them Officials also said a plethora of extra services set up to relieve pressure on casualty units, such as walk-in centres, urgent care centres, and minor injury units, had created a “whole heap of confusion” for patients about where to turn, and should be rebranded with one name to provide consistent services. The principles behind the changes were broadly welcomed last night by medical experts, charities, patients groups and think tanks. However, changes to scores of hospitals across the country, in which specialist services such as acute stroke units would be centralised, are likely to prove more controversial as decisions are taken about which hospitals will see services stripped back, and when details emerge of the distances between major centres, especially in rural areas. Changes to centralise stroke care in London were made in 2010 and have been credited with saving 400 lives. However, the former head of NHS London said last year that hundreds of patients died or suffered disability in the years before, amid political arguments which delayed the changes. Concerns were raised last night about the role of 111 in the strategy, with patients groups saying it would need to improve on a “woefully inadequate” performance before it could cope with an expanded role. Officials at NHS England said further plans would be published within months, setting out the costs of the changes and the implications for the NHS workforce. The proposals could become a political battleground in the run-up to the next election. On Tuesday, Mr Hunt told the House of Commons he would not “stand in the way of changes” that save lives. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, welcomed Sir Bruce’s recommendations but accused ministers of an attempt to “abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in A&E”. NHS

Detailed information on your constituency and its newly elected MP. General Election 2010: Lib Dem plans will not pass scrutiny, says George Osborne
George Osborne warned the Liberal Democrats yesterday that their policies will come under intense scrutiny following Nick Clegg’s victory in the first televised leader’s debate.
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne Photo: EPA	By Simon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor
8:00AM BST 17 Apr 2010
The shadow Chancellor said the Lib Dems’ surprise entry to the “top table” of the general election battle meant voters would examine pledges such as scrapping Britain’s nuclear deterrent more carefully.
He also said the surge in support for Mr Clegg’s party would melt away when voters considered the ramifications of a hung parliament for the British economy and cleaning up Westminster.
An opinion poll published yesterday showed that backing for the Lib Dems increased 14 points following the debate, putting them in second place and just one point behind the Tories. But, speaking during a campaign visit to Scotland, Mr Osborne said there was no panic among Tory ranks and insisted that David Cameron showed he was the right man to be Prime Minister.
“Polls come and go. We’ve still got three weeks to go and two more debates,” he told The Daily Telegraph.
“People will start to focus on what a hung parliament means. People will need to understand it’s not a solution to the frustration with the political system. It will lead to more economic uncertainty at a time when we need economic certainty and decisiveness. What’s been lacking is strong economic direction.”

Mr Osborne conceded that Mr Clegg had performed well in the debate, but said the Lib Dems “have all the advantages and disadvantages of the third party”.
“The advantage was Clegg was saying 'a plague on both your houses’,” the shadow Chancellor said. “(But) if the Liberal Democrats want to be treated by people as being at the top table, that comes with a high degree of scrutiny.”
As an example, he highlighted the effects of scrapping the Trident nuclear submarines, based at Faslane on the Clyde, on the Scottish economy and national security.
The Lib Dems’ support for joining the euro is also likely to come under scrutiny in the second and third debates on international affairs and the economy. Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, said: “The greater degree of scrutiny these policies have, the more that people will realise that while Nick Clegg is a very attractive individual in many ways, the policies of his party are a little bit eccentric — not necessarily what you would want at a time of crisis and difficulty.”
Mr Osborne was campaigning in East Renfrewshire, a key Tory target seat held by Jim Murphy, Labour’s Scottish Secretary. Mr Murphy announced Labour’s Scottish manifesto on Monday with a warning to remember “the dark heart of the Tories”.
Labour’s first party political broadcast north of the Border, the following day, featured images of Margaret Thatcher, Norman Tebbit, closed mines and the Poll Tax riots. Mr Osborne said he had seen the broadcast, which was shown north of the Border only, and called it “pathetic and desperate”. “Labour have got nothing else to say to themselves except to drag up attack from 20 to 30 years ago,” he said.
“They’ve run out of ideas and energy. Scotland needs a change.”
He said more than 100 Scottish businesses, including Sir Tom Hunter and Sir Tom Farmer, the entrepreneurs, had signed up to Tory opposition to an increase in National Insurance.

Kate Winslet collects CBE as the Queen tells her 'motherhood is the only job'
Kate Winslet reveals what the Queen told her as she collected her CBE at Buckingham Palace. 4:23PM GMT 21 Nov 2012
Kate Winslet has won an Oscar, several Golden Globes and Baftas, but she was still slightly bemused when she collected her latest honour, a CBE for her services to drama. Speaking outside Buckingham Palace she said: "I thought, 'why am I being given one of these?' And now, having just been through the ceremony, I still think, 'why was I given one?'" The 37-year-old actress said it was an "unbelievable honour" and revealed that the Queen had congratulated her and asked about her enjoyment of acting. "I said yes I loved it but not as much as I love being a mother. She said, 'yes well that is the only job' and I thought that was really touching." Ms Winslet has a daughter, Mia, 12, with her first husband Jim Threapleton and had a son, Joe, with American Beauty and Skyfall director Sam Mendes in 2003. Related Articles

West Africa delegation tells Ivory Coast's Gbagbo he must go West African leaders delivered an ultimatum to Laurent Gbagbo in person on Tuesday after threatening military action if he does not accept an offer to go into exile in a neighbouring country a month after the disputed election.
Mr Gbagbo, the incumbent leader who has been in power for a decade in Ivory Coast, has so far shown no interest in stepping aside despite the calls for him to go Photo: AFP	11:37PM GMT 28 Dec 2010
The regional delegation led by presidents from Sierra Leone, Cape Verde and Benin held meetings with both Mr Gbagbo and internationally recognised winner Alassane Ouattara.
Mr Gbagbo's government reacted by threatening to expel ambassadors whose countries, at the request of his rival Alassane Ouattara, ended the tenure of his appointees abroad.
"We understand that some governments, saying they are acting on the basis of statements coming from Mr Alassane Ouattara, intend to put an end to the missions of our ambassadors in their states," Mr Gbagbo's government said in a statement read out on RTI public television.
"Faced with such decisions ... contrary to diplomatic practice," the government "reserves the right to apply reciprocity by ending the missions of the concerned countries' ambassadors."
Mr Gbagbo, the incumbent leader who has been in power for a decade in Ivory Coast, has so far shown no interest in stepping aside despite the calls for him to go. While Mr Ouattara has been endorsed by most of the world, Mr Gbagbo still maintains control of Ivory Coast's military and security forces.

Ivory Coast's incumbent president locked in crucial negotiations
28 Dec 2010
Weeks of post-election violence have left at least 173 people dead, according to the U.N. The toll is believed to be much higher: The U.N. said it has been unable to investigate reports of a mass grave because of restrictions on U.N. personnel movements.
The U.N. mission said on Tuesday that a peacekeeper had been wounded with a machete when a large crowd encircled a convoy and set one of its vehicles on fire. There have been growing concerns about violence targeting peacekeepers since Mr Gbagbo called for the U.N. mission known as UNOCI to leave earlier this month.
"UNOCI vigorously condemns this attack and reiterates its determination to pursue its work in the service of the Ivorian people," the U.N. mission said in a statement.
The 15-nation regional bloc ECOWAS has threatened to use "legitimate force" if Mr Gbagbo does not relinquish power. Nigeria has the strongest army in the region and is expected to play a major role if an operation is launched to oust Mr Gbagbo.
Mr Ouattara's camp has been confident in recent days that such help is coming.
"It's not a bluff," one senior Ouattara adviser said on Monday on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. "The soldiers are coming much faster than anyone thinks."
ECOWAS has intervened in past disputes, including the seizing of Sierra Leone's capital in 1998 that forced military junta leaders to flee and allowed an elected president to return to power. ECOWAS also intervened in Liberia in 1990 and its forces stayed for several years, and it has sent troops to Guinea-Bissau as well.
Some analysts feel an ECOWAS mission in Ivory Coast would entail a full-scale invasion, causing numerous civilian casualties. Cote Divoire

School secretary talks down AK-47 wielding gunman in police 911 tape
A newly released police recording reveals how a school clerk in the USA helped calm a gunman who had entered the school armed with an assault rifle and begun firing.
9:32PM BST 23 Aug 2013
Police in Decatur, Georgia, are calling a school secretary a heroine for helping talk a school gunman into surrendering. A recording from a 911 call on Tuesday reveals how Antoinette Tuff, a school clerk in the Ronald E McNair Discovery Learning Academy, helped talk Michael Brandon Hill, who was armed with an AK-47, out of shooting. Hill walked into the school and fired shots, but not at anyone. Ms Tuff called the police and kept talking to the gunman until they arrived whilst schoolchildren were evacuated. The standoff ended with no one getting hurt. Hill was arrested. Related Articles

Peterborough 1 Crystal Palace 2: match report
Read a full match report of the Championship match between Peterborough and Crystal Palace at London Road on Saturday Nov 10, 2012.
United in opposition: despite going head to head over 90 minutes on Saturday, Darren Ferguson and Ian Holloway were at least in agreement over the electrifying performance of Palace youngster Wilfried Zaha Photo: ACTION IMAGES	By Tom Prentki, London Road
10:23PM GMT 10 Nov 2012
Comments
Wilfried Zaha celebrated his 20th birthday by inspiring Crystal Palace to a fourth successive victory and a return to the top of the Championship as he laid on two late goals at Peterborough.
Zaha, whose performance was described by both managers as “unplayable”, ran 60 yards with the ball glued to his feet, as it was for much of this game, before feeding Kagisho Dikgacoi for the decisive strike, leaving Palace 13 games unbeaten.
“Well done Dougie, thanks a lot. Let’s see if we can keep going,” said Holloway in a nod to his predecessor, Dougie Freedman. “There’s only 30 [fixtures] left.” Ian Holloway described his time at Blackpool as “the best trip I’ve ever been on” but his new journey with Palace could hardly have started better. The signs were ominous when Zaha’s double step-over beat Joe Newell inside two minutes, but Grant McCann needed only six to put the home side in front after good work from George Boyd.

Zaha was determined to enjoy himself, though, and danced past defenders at will. “When he’s got the ball at his feet, God help you,” said Holloway. “Fantastic footballer and what a lovely kid.” Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson agreed: “I’d pay to watch him myself. He’s the best player outside the Premier League hands-down.”
The excitement of the situation was threatening to get the better of the birthday boy and the referee asked Palace captain Mile Jedinak to mediate in discussions with Zaha following a series of petulant fouls and steely glances.
“I’ve never seen so many fouls on one player in my entire life”, added Holloway. “Maybe Pele in the World Cup when they carried him off on a stretcher.”
Peterborough were proving more obstinate opposition than Palace’s recent opponents with Yannick Bolasie, Glenn Murray and Zaha repeatedly frustrated by a combination of wilful defending and inspired goalkeeping.
The irritation was notable on the touchline, too, with the fourth official being given a regular ear bashing by Ferguson and Holloway before Andre Moritz fired home a brilliant equaliser.
Despite the late timing of the goals, Ferguson, whose side stay in the bottom three, felt the result was not unjust. “We were well beaten. They were by far the better team. Our possession, in terms of us on the ball, was very poor.”

Severity of Luis Suarez ban bitterly disappointing, blasts Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers claims the severity of Luis Suarez's 10-match ban has left them "bitterly disappointed". Stunned: Luis Suarez will be sidelined for 10 matches Photo: AFP	By Telegraph Sport, and agencies

The Uruguay striker was yesterday handed a lengthy suspension for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. Liverpool have until midday tomorrow to appeal and will make their decision after receipt of the disciplinary panel's report, which has to arrive with the club before 6pm today. "It is the severity of the ban that has hurt most," said the Liverpool manager. "That is something we are bitterly disappointed with - not so much the ban because everyone has seen it and Luis was very open and honest to know it was wrong.
"I felt it could have been 12 games but with a six-game ban and six games suspended, looking at his future behaviour. Related Articles

If money's tight, here's how to supplement your income
Purse Strings: As the cost of living rises, Kara Gammell reveals a few ways you could increase your cash flow this winter in Telegraph Wonder Women's weekly money advice column. Make like Pippa Middleton and plan parties. Being a party consultant is another way to earn money flexibly, because you can choose how many parties to book and work around your schedule.

Families across the country will be reeling from yet another blow from the government last week – and who can blame them? I'm annoyed and my first child is not even due until April. In his Autumn Statement, the Chancellor revealed plans to limit the annual increase in most benefits to just 1pc for the next three years. He gave the impression that the move would largely affect the unemployed, but what he failed to mention was that it will be new mums and hard-working families who are paying the price. In the small print in the documents issued by the Treasury, it said that maternity pay would be one of the benefits that will not be rising in line with inflation. Funny, he didn't mention that. As it stands now, the first six weeks of maternity leave are paid at 90pc of the mother's usual wage, and this will not change. However, women currently receive £135.45 per week for the remaining 33 weeks of statutory maternity pay, worth up to a total of £4,469.85. Normally, the Treasury would increase maternity pay by the Consumer Price Index measure of inflation, which recent figures put at 2.7pc. However now maternity pay will now rise by just 1pc for the next three years. Related Articles

13 Nov 2012
As a result, by 2015 the amount paid to a new mother will be £236.48 lower over the course of the 33 weeks than if maternity pay rose in line with inflation. Which on the face of it, might not look too bad. But trust me, from where I am standing, it doesn't look so good. If most pregnant women are like me and worriedly counting down the number of full pay packets until the money from our employer stops, dropping down to about £540 a month will be a shock to the system – no matter how much you can save before then. What's more, it is only going to get worse for pregnant women over the next three years. And as if this is not bad enough, families are also about to be hit with the changes to child benefit. The changes, which come into affect in January, mean that while once a universal benefit, parents who earn over a certain amount will have payments stopped. It is only going to get worse for pregnant women over the next three years. Currently, child benefit is worth £20.30 a week for the first child, then £13.20 a week for each subsequent child. However, from January 7 next year, any family in which anyone earns more than £50,000 will see their payment reduced, depending on the earnings above that level. Anyone who earns more than £60,000 will see their family's benefit disappear completely. Thanks for that George. Just when we thought times were tough enough already, it keeps getting worse. A home finance double whammy. So with the cost of living constantly rising, many families are desperately trying to come up with ways to supplement their income. If this sounds like you, read on for a few ways you could increase your cash flow this winter. When money gets tight, it's time to get creative. Train as a doula If you have a supportive nature and are not the squeamish sort, then why not train as a doula and help new mothers? Doulas are usually women who have had children of their own and are hired to assist new mothers either during pregnancy or in the weeks following the birth. To get started, you will need training. One option is British Doulas (britishdoulas.co.uk) an agency that offers a five-day training course which is taught by midwifery trainers and a working doula. Courses run several times a year and cost £300. Here you will also benefit from the agency who will provide you with introductions to expectant mothers. But how much money can you make? Doulas in this country make on average between £10 and £12 per hour for post-birth work and between £200 and £400 for a birth depending on your experience and where you are located. For more information on training in your local area, visit Doulas UK (doula.org.uk). Sing for your supper If you have a loud singing voice and enjoy working with children, then running your own music classes for babies and toddlers a way to make a bit of extra cash. Getting started is easier than you think as franchises are available from Caterpillar Music (caterpillarmusic.com) and Monkey Music (monkeymusic.co.uk) and for a fee, you will be provided with everything you need to launch your own business – such as equipment, training, lesson plans, web site and national advertising. In terms of earnings potential, the amount you can charge depends on your location. For those who live in London, for example, prices for a 40-minute class vary from £7.95-£10 or for those outside the capital, £4.95. Caterpillar franchises cost £9,500 (plus VAT) to start while Monkey Music costs £11,895 (plus VAT) and includes sole right to run the business in a specified territory using the brand name, and trademarks under a renewable five-year licence. But if you live in London and teach three classes a week with 18 children for one year, you could easily earn £20,736 – meaning you can earn the franchise fee back in no time at all. Get paid to party Being a party consultant is another way to earn money flexibly, because you can choose how many parties to book and work around your schedule. As a consultant, you would book and organise parties to demonstrate products to the host and their guests. The amount you earn can vary on the number of parties you work, for example, with Jamie at Home (jamieathome.com), you get 20pc commission of anything you sell while The Body Shop (thebodyshop.com) will pay you 25pc commission on sales. Most companies will offer additional bonuses and incentives on products you sell, helping you maximise your earnings. Start up costs vary with each company but most starter kits range from as little as £38 with Usbourne Books (usborne.com) and The Body Shop to as much as around £120 or £198 at Jamie at Home and Stella & Dot (stelladot.co.uk) respectively. Teach language to kids If you have a lively personality and are fluent in French or Spanish, you could teach pre-school and primary schoolchildren a second language to generate extra income. Using the La Jolie Ronde (lajolieronde.co.uk) method, you teach the language through action songs, games, stories and role plays. To get started you need £750. This includes a licence, all curriculum, training and free advertising, marketing training plus a £150 refundable bond for all teaching materials. Teachers can charge an average of £4.20 per child, per 30-minute class and once you set aside the hire of premises at £10 an hour and have deducted 80p royalty fee per child per lesson, you could easily earn an annual income of £8,500 for teaching just 5 hours a week, thirty weeks a year. Don't forget the taxman While extra income will be welcome in most homes, you will still have to pay tax on your earnings. Any sources of extra income need to be declared, so make sure you're upfront with HM Revenue and Customs. If you've got self employed income, you must register with the HMRC Helpline for the Newly Self Employed on 08459 15 45 15 by the end of the third calendar month after you started, or you face an automatic £100 penalty. For more information, visit hmrc.gov.uk/selfemployed. Telegraph Wonder Women wants to hear what's on your mind when it comes to money. Are you perplexed by pensions, enraged by energy bills or confused by childcare costs? Email your questions or comments to wonderwomen@telegraph.co.uk with 'Purse Strings' in the subject line and we'll consider including them in future columns.
