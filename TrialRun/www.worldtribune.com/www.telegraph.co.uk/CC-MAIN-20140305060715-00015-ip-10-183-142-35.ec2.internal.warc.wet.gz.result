Michael Barker is named alongside Martin Sinclair, the brother of Swansea star Scott, and 5-a-side legend Dave Clarke who was won the Golden Boot at three World Cups. Twelve of the squad will feature in the 7-a-side team, for players with cerebral palsy, while 10 players have been named in the 5-a-side squad, for players with a visual impairment. Clarke, who recently introduced David Beckham to the sport at a training session, said that competing at a home Games would fulfil a life time dream of his. “It is very difficult to describe my overwhelming emotion after learning of my selection for London 2012," said Clarke. "The confirmation of my place in the squad is the realisation of a life time dream and a unique chance to compete at the pinnacle of my sport and on home soil in front of our own fans.

“From the moment I heard the remarkable announcement that London had been awarded the 2012 Paralympics, the journey to selection and competing at the Games has been my life. Selection is merely the start of the hard slog toward a medal, however, and the real work begins now to achieve what we all unanimously crave.” ParalympicsGB Chef de Mission Craig Hunter welcomed the footballers who made the squads, saying: "Their selection is undoubtedly the culmination of many years of hard work and I'd like to congratulate every one of them."
