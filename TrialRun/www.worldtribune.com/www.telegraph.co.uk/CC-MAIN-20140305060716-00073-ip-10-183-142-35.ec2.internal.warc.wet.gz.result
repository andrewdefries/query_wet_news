First butterflies, now moths decline
Britain's moths are in danger of dying out, a new report has warned, with three species already extinct and two thirds in decline. Once common garden species such as garden tiger moths have seen numbers fall by more than 90 per cent Photo: ALAMY By Louise Gray, Environment Correspondent
7:00AM GMT 01 Feb 2013

The night-flying insects are just as important to the ecosystem as the colourful butterflies we see during the day. But in the last 40 years two thirds of teh 1,000 British species have declined and three species - the orange upperwing, bordered gothic and Brighton wainscot - all went extinct in the last ten years. Once common garden species such as the V-moth, garden tiger and spinach moths had seen numbers fall by more than 90 per cent. The Butterfly Conservation report said moths were declining as a result of changes to habitats, in particular more intensive agriculture, and the effects of climate change, and warned it signalled a "potentially catastrophic" loss of wildlife in the UK. Across all moths - both "micro-moths" and larger species or "macro-moths" - some 62 species became extinct in the 20th century. Related Articles
Moths engulf Madrid
17 Jun 2013
Total numbers of moths have fallen 40 per cent in southern Britain but stayed stable in the north, with declines in some species balanced out by other moths faring well, the report carried out with Rothamstead Research, said. The difference between north and south is likely to be down to greater loss of habitat in southern Britain and beneficial impacts of climate change for some species in the north. On a species by species basis, populations have declined on average by 43 per cent in the south and 11 per cent in the north. Chris Packham, TV wildlife presenter and Butterfly Conservation vice-president, said we all suffer if moths decline. "Larger moths are key indicator species that let us know how our environment is faring in a period of unprecedented environmental change. "As well as being important pollinators, moths are an absolutely vital cog in the food change for other species such as birds and bats. "The dramatic and ongoing loss of moth abundance highlighted in this report signals a potentially catastrophic loss of biodiversity in the British countryside." Richard Fox, surveys manager at Butterfly Conservation and lead author of the report, said the decline in moths points to a wider decline in insects that affects the whole ecosystem and ultimately the human food chain. "This report paints a bleak picture about Britain's biodiversity. "Much has been made of the decline of butterflies and honey bees but moths represent the massive but largely un-noticed diversity of insects that form the vast majority of animal life in Britain. "The severed declines of once common moths and overall decrease in moth abundance that we found are a damning indictment of how recent human activity has devastated our native wildlife." "Larger moths are representative of that huge wealth of insect life that is out there, which is absolutely crucial for keeping the natural world going and all of the benefits that humans need from the natural world." Mr Fox said the removal of hedgerows and flower-rich margins to make bigger fields and the increasing use of pesticides and inorganic fertilisers all had an impact on moths, particularly in southern Britain where intensification of farming has been greatest. Climate change appears to be having a positive effect on some species, allowing some southern moths to spread north, but negative impacts on other moths. For example, the garden tiger moth, which has undergone a 92% fall in numbers over the 40-year period studied, is adversely affected by warmer winters and wetter springs which are becoming more common as the climate changes. The report also found that while native species have declined significantly, there has been an influx in new moth species to Britain, thought to be the consequence of warmer conditions making the country suitable for continental species. More than 100 species have been recorded in the UK for the first time this century and 27 species have colonised Britain since 2000. Earth News

GW Pharma allays worries over payments for prescriptions
GW Pharma has sought to play down reports that primary care trusts (PCTs) were not paying for prescriptions for its cannabis-derived multiple sclerosis drug.
By Rachel Cooper
6:11PM BST 02 Jul 2010
Comments
Reports earlier in the week suggested that PCTs in the south central area would not prescribe Sativex, which was approved by regulators earlier this month.
GW said the decision by certain PCTs was made last year, prior to the approval of Sativex when the drug was only available on a "named patient" basis.
The company said under that programme, over 90pc of PCTs in the UK paid for Sativex on the NHS and it hoped such policies would continue for "the vast majority of PCTs". It added that NHS prescriptions for Sativex were already being written around the UK, sending GW shares up.
In March 2009, nine PCTs in the south central area, including Hampshire, Southampton, Berkshire and Portsmouth, adopted a policy that commissioning of cannabinoids such as Sativex would be low priority and therefore not routinely funded. Related Articles

Margaret Thatcher: The 'Iron Lady's' pivotal role in ending the Cold War
When a Soviet army newspaper called Margaret Thatcher the "Iron Lady" in 1976, this was intended as a scornful put-down. Margaret Thatcher with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the start of talks at the Kremlin in Moscow in 1987 Photo: AFP/GETTY	By David Blair

Margaret Thatcher obituary
Margaret Thatcher death: latest reaction
Four days earlier, the new Conservative leader had delivered a speech entitled "Britain Awake", stating her resolve to resist the "Communist aggression" that had threatened Europe and the world since 1945. "Red Star" duly retaliated by deriding the empty words of a rusting "Iron Lady". By the end of Margaret Thatcher's premiership, however, the Cold War was over and the world had been remade. As she left office in November 1990, the Soviet Union was in the throes of dissolution, the former vassal states of Eastern Europe had cast off their Moscow-installed leaders, the mighty Russian Communist party was on the verge of extinction, and the world was entering an era of unquestioned Western dominance that is only now drawing to a close. As in 1945, 1918 and 1815, this was a moment when global affairs changed forever. None of that would have seemed possible when Mrs Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979. Inevitably, Britain was second fiddle to the United States during these tumultuous events, but Mrs Thatcher played the most important supporting role in transforming the geopolitics of the world during her 11 years in office.

In the process, she made her own country infinitely more secure. After all, it was during her premiership that the shadow of nuclear annihilation, which had haunted two generations, was finally lifted. At the beginning of Mrs Thatcher's time in Downing Street, however, the Soviet Union felt confident enough to enlarge its sphere still further by invading Afghanistan. With martial law declared in Poland in 1980, the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe seemed solidly entrenched. Perhaps most seriously for Mrs Thatcher, the Kremlin also chose to escalate the Cold War by deploying a new generation of medium-range nuclear missiles - the SS20s - in European satellite states. These weapons could have destroyed every Nato capital save Washington. One of Mrs Thatcher's early decisions was to allow America to respond by stationing nuclear-tipped Cruise missiles on British soil. "No Cruise" promptly became the rallying cry for "peace campaigners", some of whom camped outside RAF Greenham Common, where the first weapons arrived. Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, had no need to worry about public opinion in his own domain. He deployed the SS-20s because he believed that Western leaders lacked the stomach to respond. Had CND - then a mass organisation - been heeded, Brezhnev would have triumphed. As it turned out, Mrs Thatcher wrecked his gamble. By offering British bases for Cruise missiles, she helped West Germany to follow suit. This counter-move forced the Soviet Union to the negotiating table, eventually leading to the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty of 1987, which eliminated both Cruise and the SS-20s. As such, it provided a classic example of multilateral disarmament in action. When Ronald Reagan became US president in January 1981, his analysis of the Cold War was identical to Mrs Thatcher's. Like the Prime Minister, Reagan believed that building the West's military strength was the key to containing the Soviet Union and then forcing the Kremlin to negotiate. Unlike Mrs Thatcher, however, he was able to build a military machine capable of outclassing Moscow. Reagan duly embarked on the biggest military build-up in peacetime history, overhauling the US armed forces and expanding its nuclear arsenal. He took this still further in 1983 by proposing a missile defence system, dubbed "Star Wars", capable of protecting the US and its allies from a Soviet nuclear strike. In retrospect, that was a turning point. The Soviet Union faced the impossible choice of building enough missiles to overwhelm "Star Wars", or matching with a version of its own. Either option was unaffordable. While the US could be a military superpower by investing about 7 per cent of its national income on defence, Moscow had to spend at least 30 per cent just to keep pace. That kind of imbalance was simply impossible to sustain. While Reagan took the pivotal decisions, he needed his allies to bolster American resolve. And that was where Mrs Thatcher came in. By offering immovable support, she helped Reagan to accelerate the end of the Cold War. She also won a degree of influence in the White House unmatched by any other Western leader. Sometimes, she would speak for both America and Britain at summits, declaring what "Ron and I both think". They might have appeared a picture of harmony in public, yet this duo had fierce private disagreements. Mrs Thatcher was infuriated by Reagan's failure to offer America's unconditional backing after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in April 1982. At first, he offered only “impartial mediation” between the two sides, placing London on an equal footing with the military junta in Buenos Aires, before he finally chose to place Washington firmly on Britain's side. Mrs Thatcher and Reagan also fell out in 1983 when the US invaded Grenada without dignifying Britain with a warning, despite the fact that this Caribbean island is a member of the Commonwealth and keeps the Queen as head of state. But their many differences paled by comparison with their unity over the Cold War. Reagan, often vague and stumbling in public, had an aversion to detail. Mrs Thatcher, the chemist and tax lawyer by training, was never less than fully briefed on any subject that mattered. Their minds worked in different ways, yet both shared identical instincts and the same Manichean view of the global struggle represented by the Cold War. She was also the first to identify a Soviet politician who grasped the hard reality that his country could not win the Cold War. While still only a member of the Politburo, Mikhail Gorbachev visited Britain in December 1984 and met Mrs Thatcher at Chequers. Afterwards, she declared: "I like Mr Gorbachev. We can do business together."
That was exactly the seal of approval Gorbachev was looking for. Six months later, he took over the Kremlin with the aim of ending the Cold War. He need to convince Reagan of his seriousness - and winning over Mrs Thatcher was the first step. Armed with this endorsement, Gorbachev duly made his way to the White House, where he and Reagan negotiated the disarmament treaties that ended more than four decades of nuclear-tipped confrontation. Gorbachev also made clear that the Soviet Union would no longer use force to prop up client regimes in Eastern Europe. There would be no repeats of Budapest, 1956, or Prague, 1968. One by one, these regimes duly fell in the revolutions of 1989. With an economy ravaged by Communism, the Soviet Union was weaker than it looked. In retrospect, its collapse was probably inevitable. But Mrs Thatcher helped to accelerate the process and deliver tens of millions to freedom earlier than might otherwise have happened. Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister and an exiled dissident in the 1980s, duly paid one of the warmest tributes on Monday. Mrs Thatcher was, he said, a "fearless champion of liberty" who "stood up for captive nations" and "helped the free world win the Cold War". Margaret Thatcher

‘Blazing ring' eclipse plunges Africa, Asia into darkness
A solar eclipse that reduced the sun to a blazing ring surrounding a sombre disk plunged millions of people in Africa and Asia into semi-darkness on Friday.

The spectacle, visible in a roughly 185-mile band running 8,060 miles across the globe, set a record for the longest annular eclipse that will remain unbeaten for more than a thousand years.
An annular eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly in front of the sun but does not completely obscure it, thus leaving a ring - an annulus - of sunlight flaring around the lunar disk. The moon's shadow first struck the south-western tip of Chad and western Central African Republic at 5.14 GMT and then reached Uganda, Kenya, and Somalia before racing across India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China.
Local media in the affected areas issued warnings about the dangers of looking directly at the sun, but fascinated onlookers thronged streets to witness the celestial phenomenon. In India, where the eclipse was visible from the southern-most tip, astronomers and curious spectators watched in awe, using sunglasses and even ultra-dark welding masks as day turned into darkness.

The maximum duration of "annularity" - the time the moon is in front of the sun -- was 11 minutes, eight seconds at 706 GMT, making it "the longest annular eclipse of the 3rd Millennium," according to Nasa. Only on December 23, 3043 will this record be beaten, Nasa said.

Police launch murder inquiry after disappearance of Florida lottery winner A man who disappeared after winning $30 million (£19 million) in the Florida lottery may have been murdered for his fortune, police believe. By Tom Leonard in New York 4:45PM GMT 06 Jan 2010
Three years after Abraham Shakespeare, 43, hit the jackpot, police are discounting his mother's optimistic theory that he is hiding away from hangers-on in the Caribbean and are instead treating his disappearance as homicide. "There are a lot of odd and bizarre circumstances in this case," said Grady Judd, a sheriff in Polk County. He said it was particularly suspicious that Mr Shakespeare did not even ring his mother at Christmas. "We fear and are preparing for the worst. We're working this case as if it were a homicide."
According to his family, the lorry driver's problems only began when he bought a winning lottery ticket at a convenience store in a town called Frostproof. Choosing to take a $16.9 million lump sum rather than the full amount in instalments, he bought a new car, a Rolex from a pawn shop and a $1 million home in a gated community. Mr Shakespeare - who has a criminal record for burglary, battery and not paying child support - talked of setting up a foundation for the poor. However, his luck started to change when a colleague sued him over allegations that Mr Shakespeare stole the winning ticket from his wallet as they drove to Miami. Mr Shakespeare won the case but rapidly became a target for people asking him for money. Elizabeth Walker, his mother, said he was generous, paying for funerals, lending money to friends starting businesses and giving $1 million to a friend. Police believe he has already spent the bulk of his winnings. Officials and relatives say that shortly after buying his new house in 2007, he was approached by a woman named Dee Dee Moore who said she wanted to write a book about him. She became his financial adviser and bought Mr Shakespeare's home for $655,000 last January. According to police, he has not been seen since April when Miss Moore, 37, told a local newspaper he was "laying low" to avoid people asking him for money. She filmed Mr Shakespeare saying he wanted to disappear because he was being hounded by other people and was tired of it. She said she had produced the video in order to "protect" herself.
In December, she told the newspaper she wanted him to reappear because police were searching her home and looking for blood on her belongings. Sheriffs would not comment further on her involvement in Mr Shakespeare's life.
"I hope so much that he is alive somewhere," said Mr Shakespeare's mother.

The farcical fiddling and meddling of 23-man rugby union is ruining the game
The overuse of replacements is shortchanging rugby fans and ruining the game, according to Mick Cleary In the pink: Cardiff Blues, outplayed for an hour by Exeter, were able to bring players off the bench and score four tries to earn a precious bonus point Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Mick Cleary

You can set your watch by them, sure in the knowledge that a gaggle of Michelin tyre-like lumps will be stripping off their padded coats and trotting on to the field around the hour mark to lend their weight to the cause and ruining the game in the process. If we all had a pound for every time that weary cliché is trotted out – “It’s no longer a 15-man game, it’s a 23-man game, it’s all about the bench, it’s all about the match-day squad” – we could retire tomorrow. It is not a 23-man game. Rugby union is a 15-man game and many of us wish to the high heavens that it would revert to it. The latest instalment of this farce came at Sandy Park on Sunday where Exeter had given one of the most exhilarating displays of high-energy rugby seen in this or any other season. Vibrant, bold, direct – it was all too much for a hapless Cardiff Blues who were an embarrassment, suitably red-faced in their pink shirts, blowing hard from their exertions as they chased shadows.

Exeter were six tries to the good, leading 41-3 when the scourge appeared on the sidelines. You knew. You just knew it. The game would go to the dogs. And it did. It lost shape, it lost meaning, it lost credibility. Yeah, yeah, the horrible mess was compounded by Exeter having two players sin-binned within a minute of each other. Of course that made a significant difference. But the process of disintegration had already begun. The Chiefs had made half a dozen substitutions by that point, only a couple of them injury enforced. Fiddle and meddle – a coach has been given full rein to do just that, and very few can resist. Exeter head coach, Rob Baxter, even admitted as much afterwards. You can understand his logic. The contest was as good as over and here was a chance to give backup players some precious game time out in the middle. All very sensible from his point of view. And all very frustrating for those of us who brought up on an older truth – that 15 blokes go at it hammer and tongs for 80 minutes until the other lot wilt and that is when you get your reward. What happened at Sandy Park? Cardiff were gifted a bonus point as they scored four tries, with a nod to the overflowing sin-bin as the prime reason for that. What would we have paid to see Exeter continue to turn the screw, really ram home their advantage over the Blues, to carry on in that first-half vein? My gut feeling is that they would have posted at least 60 points, Cardiff would have been humiliated and that there would have been, at most, only one sin-binning. One of the yellow cards was picked up by one of those replacements, Sireli Naqelevuki, within minutes of coming on to the field, for a reckless high tackle on Cardiff wing, Harry Robinson. It was in keeping with the mood of the moment: frantic, frenetic, unstructured as the new cast list tried to get used to each other. All the poise had gone, that sense of a corps of blokes all perfectly tuned to each other’s radar, finding one another no matter how dense the traffic. Instead, it was fitful and terribly unfulfilling. Players will never sound off about it. Coaches certainly will not do so as it extends their influence. But nobody can be truly satisfied with it. The players who get the shepherd’s hook from the sidelines feel aggrieved that they are not trusted to go the distance while the blokes on the bench sit there like stuffed dummies for most of the afternoon, their week’s preparation for the big moment dependent on the whim of a coach. It used to be a matter of considerable pride for props to see their opposite number begin to weaken. What exactly is the reward for a dominant prop these days? Their opponents send on someone else to test him, fresh and raring to go. That cannot be right. Of course, we know that health and safety will have their way, that front-rows must be protected, that substitutions are a welfare issue and that they are here to stay. That is as may be, although I would still favour trimming the replacement bench to a maximum of four players. Rugby is a game of confrontation, of testing an opponent’s mental and physical resolve. May the stronger or more skilful man win. That is no longer the case. Beat one, here comes another. How long before we get specialist goal-kicking replacements? Rolling substitutions? It could never happen, you say? I wonder. Let Sonny Bill be
Sonny Bill Williams, league, union, boxing, league, RWC2015 – whatever he touches turns to gold dust. Those who mock him for his butterfly tendencies, flitting from one sport to the other, have no joy in their soul. Players do not bitch about him. SBW is a professional athlete, a hired hand. Commitment is a matter of contract these days, not heart. Overkill Down Under
Remember that wonderful game in Johannesburg 10 days ago between South Africa and New Zealand, a fitting finale to the Rugby Championship? Well, if you thought it was all over in the southern hemisphere, here they come again, the All Blacks against the Wallabies in Dunedin on Saturday. Why? Good question. The less-is-more theory of marketing has never quite worked down there. Club

Harlequins 46 Leeds 11: match report
Read a full match report from the Guinness Premiership game between Harlequins and Leeds at Twickenham Stoop
on Saturday April 10 2010. By Nick Pearce at Twickenham Stoop
8:32PM BST 10 Apr 2010
Comments
Mike Brown scored two tries as Harlequins romped to a bonus-point victory to leave Leeds with a familiar feeling of relegation dread.
The hosts scored five second-half tries to keep their hopes of Heineken Cup qualification alive. Quins’ first try came 13 minutes in after wing David Strettle took a quick line-out before releasing Brown down the middle, who played in Tom Williams for a fine try. Strettle offloaded to Brown for Quins’ second try after the break before the Quins wing found George Lowe for a simple run-in. Quins’ fourth try came from the rolling maul, and hooker Chris Brooker was the man who came up with the ball. Tom Williams’ hack-on was scooped up by Brown for another score before Strettle sprinted in for the final try. Alfie To’oala bagged a consolation for Leeds, but they will need to produce better displays if they are to beat the drop.

We don't want to tell my husband's family I'm pregnant
Vicki and Octavia, our mother and daughter agony aunts, answer your questions 7:00AM GMT 05 Dec 2012
Comments
Send your 50-word dilemma to dearvickiandoctavia@telegraph.co.uk My husband and I are loath to tell his family that I am pregnant. They refused to attend our wedding and we don't want my husband’s stepmother in particular to have anything to do with the baby. She’s racist, shallow and dangerous. But I worry about the long-term consequences of not telling them. What should I do?
VICKI Congratulations: I wish you and the babe well. As to what to do, here’s a list: eat plenty of vitamin-rich food, drink little or no alcohol and try to attend yoga classes (marvellous for breath control). What not to do is visit your graceless stepmother-in-law. Cleanse her from your mind. Don’t fret about ‘long-term consequences’. The late, great childbirth guru of the 20th century, Mrs Betty Parsons, would have said, ‘Don’t fight what you can’t change.’ She died in February this year, but her lovely book, Understanding Childbirth, will soothe and settle you.
OCTAVIA My sister didn’t tell our father when she got married and she has told me recently that, looking back, she regrets it. A wedding, after all, is a one-off and, since they are on much happier terms now, it would be nice to remember him being there. But having a baby is less blink-and-you-miss-it – they will be just as interested in their grand- (or stepgrand-) child in a few years as they would be now, so if you do become reconciled (or she somehow becomes deep and unbigoted) you can make up for lost time then.
