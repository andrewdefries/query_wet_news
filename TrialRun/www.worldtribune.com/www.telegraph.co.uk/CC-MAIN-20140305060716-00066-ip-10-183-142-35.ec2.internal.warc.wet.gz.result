A global beanfeast that may yet prove its worth
The G8 summit in Lough Erne has been a curiously flat affair, but David Cameron is right to stress its importance Face to face: David Cameron and Barack Obama at the G8 summit Photo: Reuters	By Telegraph View
8:04PM BST 18 Jun 2013
Comments
The G8 conference in Northern Ireland was constructed, perhaps deliberately, in the image of its host. Instead of visionary statements and passionate rhetoric, there was a calculated blend of pragmatism, populism, consensus-building and studied – if awkward – informality.
David Cameron and his guests focused on what the Prime Minister called the three Ts: tax, trade and transparency (he then added a fourth: terrorism). To that end, there were worthwhile, if limited, announcements on a number of fronts. The “Lough Erne Declaration” highlighted the virtues of free trade, openness and fair taxation, and pledged to ensure that the developing world is not defrauded of its riches. Negotiations over a long-awaited EU-US trade deal will finally go ahead, which could bring enormous benefits to both sides. Ransom payments that fund extremists will be curbed; there will be more help for Libya; Russia and the US will cooperate further in securing and destroying surplus nuclear material; and a communiqué was agreed over Syria that sets out a blueprint for a post-Assad regime, incorporating all of the main factions and ethnic groups, although rather less was said about how this happy state of affairs will be brought about.
While these measures are welcome, there was nevertheless a curious feel to the summit, and not just because of the Potemkin shopfronts erected in Enniskillen or the complacency of the tieless, jacketed figures who gave their self-congratulatory press conferences. It was such a flat affair that even the anti-capitalists who normally turn the G8 into a circus seemed to have lost their motivation, save for a bizarre excursion in a Viking longboat. Perhaps this is because those attending knew in advance that Russian intransigence – and unease among their own voters – would prevent any drastic action over Syria. Or because a summit that includes the prickly Vladimir Putin (as well as two representatives from the European Union) but excludes the world’s rising power, China, seems an increasingly peculiar cockpit for global governance.
The temptation, therefore, is to feel that the G8 has become primarily a chance for world leaders to massage each others’ egos. Yet, as Mr Cameron said in his closing remarks, it is better for them to meet than not – and the agreements reached would have taken far longer without such face-to-face encounters. While it will take much hard graft to turn the fine talk on tax transparency into genuine action, the EU-US trade deal is certainly something that could make a real and welcome difference to voters’ lives. If it can be completed, it will make the hoopla and expense of hosting such a global beanfeast more than worthwhile.

EU committee approves sharing of public data
Public sector information could be shared across the EU, as a committee representing the 27 nations endorsed an open data plan in the hope of delivering a €40bn (£34.1bn) economic boost.

Comments
The EU council’s so-called ‘Coreper’ committee backed Commission plans to open up public sector information such as geographical data and statistics to be re-used for any purpose across Europe.
European leaders hope this will inject a much needed €40bn into the crisis­-hit Eurozone as business and developers can use the data at a low cost to create products.
Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission, said: "Opening up public data means opening up business opportunities, creating jobs and building communities.”
The UK was praised for the availability of its data. It is hoped that other countries in the 27-nation bloc can follow suit, and produce apps like Commuter, which provided live updates to London public transport users using such data.
Coreper committee’s latest endorsement is part of the drive to update the 2003 Public Sector Information Directive, which was introduced to make it easier for businesses to access and re-use government-held information.
The European Commission is also hoping to extend the reach of the Directive to include libraries, museums and archives, so information from these institutions can be accessed for the first time.
But a civil liberties protection group warned that these plans come with dangers.
Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: “Open data has huge potential, but it can equally have serious and wide-ranging unintended consequences. Whether it is used to re-identify supposedly anonymous data or added to existing datasets to better profile people, every dataset released needs to be properly scrutinised to ensure these risks are addressed.
“The so called ‘jigsaw effect’ of different information being pieced together is becoming a realistic danger as computing power and the types of information available increase.”
European Parliament must now formally approve these reforms, which form part of the Commission’s Digital Agenda strategy designed to help digital technologies deliver sustainable economic growth.

Ferrari 500 Superfast at auction
Ultra-rare Ferrari from 1964, one of only 36 ever made, to be auctioned in Paris in February The Ferrari 500 Superfast on the Pininfarina stand at the 1964 Paris motor show By Paul Hudson

The fourth of only 36 built, the 500 Superfast S1 being auctioned by Artcurial at its sale during the annual Retromobile classic car show in Paris on February 7 was displayed by Pininfarina at the 1964 Paris and Turin motor shows. It has covered only 59,965km (37,262 miles) from new but was the subject of an extensive resoration in Germany after covering 57,000km. Bodied by Pininfarina in August 1964, this extremely rare car was the most powerful, exclusive and expensive road-going Ferrari of its day. It is estimated to sell for €1,500,000 to €1,800,000 (£1,270,000 to £1,520,000 at current exchange rates). Costing twice as much as the 275 GTB, the 36 examples were tailor-made for individual clients. The 500 Superfast has become one of the most highly sought after road-going Ferraris. Built for a high-profile, wealthy clientèle, the luxuriously finished car also delivered breathtaking performance for the time, with a top speed of 170mph. It was reputedly capable of 100mph in second gear. Related Articles

After its Paris and Turin motor show appearances it was sold to its first owner, Mrs Licia Viglia from Naples, in November 1964. Featuring in the Ferrari Yearbook in 1965, the car remained in Italy until 1970 when it was exported to the US and bought by Joe Vittoria, future head of Avis Rental cars. Apart from a three-year stay in the UK, it remained in the US for over 30 years before returning to Europe. The current owner acquired the car at auction in Paris in February 2006. The car has been certified by Ferrari Classiche and will appear at the auction in its original Blu Chiaro bodywork with beautifully patinated black leather upholstery. Other highlights of the Artcurial Motorcars' Retromobile sale include a 1953 Ferrari 166MM by Oblin and a 1937 Delahaye 135MS Roadster by Chapron in superb original condition that has been in the same family ownership for the last 60 years. There's also a delectable 1975 Citroën SM Mylord convertible by Chapron, one of only seven produced. The car was bought from the Chapron stand at the Geneva motor show and has been in the same family ownership ever since. A 1929 Alfa Romeo 6C1750 SS, a rare car with excellent history and original engine, is also at the auction, along with an ex-Pierluigi Martini 1991 Ferrari F40 and a rare, French-registered 1966 Aston Martin DB6 Vantage.

Naples Pietro Cavallini, Crucifixion, San Domenico Maggiore A Roman forerunner of Giotti, Pietro Cavallini worked in Naples in the first years of the 14th century. In the Brancaccio chapel of this huge monastic complex he frescoed this touching, atmospheric Crucifixion (1208). Otranto Mosaic floor, Pantaleone Santa Maria Annunziata (above)
Probably of Greek origin, the 12th-century monk Pantaleone who signed his name on this unique mosaic artwork which covers the whole floor of Otranto’s cathedral, in a thrilling, captivating mix including the goddess Diana, King Arthur, Caron ferrying the dead across the Styx and the three Fates as well, of course, as more orthodox Christian icons.
