Follow The 27-year-old was accused of putting lives at risk by tampering with saline and other medicines at the NHS hospital.
She was also charged with one count of theft of medicine from the hospital. The charges came after three days of questioning by detectives from Greater Manchester Police. Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West, said: "We have now decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge Rebecca Leighton with three charges of criminal damage intending to endanger life, three charges of criminal damage being reckless as to whether life would be endangered and one charge of theft.
"These are serious charges that relate to allegations that Rebecca Leighton tampered with medical products, saline ampoules and saline bags in Stepping Hill Hospital and by doing so endangered the lives of patients.
The maximum sentence for the criminal damage charges is life imprisonment. She will appear at City Magistrates' Court on Saturday.

Ms Leighton was arrested at dawn on Wednesday by officers who raided the small flat in Stockport where she lives with her fiancé, Tim Papworth. Earlier the Daily Telegraph revealed that she had been passed over for a new job, thought to have been a promotion at the hospital Five patients at the hospital have now died of suspected poisoning after their saline was allegedly tampered with. Police earlier named 84-year-old Vera Pearson, as the fifth suspected victim of sabotage at the hospital. Ms Pearson was not among the 14 patients police initially believed had been treated with 36 vials of saline which were found to have been spiked with insulin. The announcement that her death, which occured on July 14, was being treated as suspicious raises fears that many more victims could now be identified. Derek Weaver, 83, died on Thursday morning. The deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, George Keep, 84, and Arnold Lancaster, 71, are all also being investigated. An unnamed 41-year-old man remains seriously ill at the hospital. Police believe that if he survives he may be able to provide vital clues to the murder investigation. Around 60 officers are now working on the investigation. A clinical audit at the hospital done earlier this year found that cupboards where medicines were stored were sometimes left unlocked and that supplies of controlled drugs were not checked on a daily basis.

Headingley washout is setback in bid to entice Yorkshire fans
A first-day washout in the second Test against New Zealand was the last thing Yorkshire wanted as they attempt to “reinvent” Headingley and their new chief executive, Mark Arthur, has warned against English cricket’s “unsustainable” model of maintaining 11 international grounds.

Umpires Steve Davis and Aleem Dar were forced to abandon play for the day without a ball being bowled shortly before 4pm, by which time the ground was virtually empty. Ticket holders on Friday will get a full refund or a ticket to next year’s Sri Lanka Test. The England and Wales Cricket Board is covered by rain insurance and Arthur said there would be “minimal” losses for Yorkshire, primarily from sales in the club shop, as the Leeds Rugby Club hold the pouring rights to the bars. With an encouraging weather forecast for the weekend, a crowd of 12,000 is expected on Saturday with 7-8,000 attending on Sunday.
Arthur took over at Yorkshire with a brief to ensure Headingley remains a big player in the battle to stage England matches. There are now 10 grounds, with Taunton also looking to join the list of venues for international cricket in this country.
Competition is fierce but the difficulty of staging international cricket and making it pay was underlined recently when Durham gave up two one-day internationals, fearing they would take a financial loss on the matches.
Lord’s and Trent Bridge are now the market leaders in staging Test cricket, but Arthur is concerned a north-south divide could develop if clubs such as Yorkshire start to miss out on matches.

“When I last worked in cricket there was a rota basis so you could set your business plans according to when you knew you would miss out on a particular Test match,” said Arthur, a former chief executive of Nottinghamshire and Nottingham Forest. “On an eight-year programme you would know what you were going to get. Now there is a huge bidding process with 10, soon to be 11, grounds and it is unsustainable.
“There is a finite amount of international cricket in this country. To spread it among 11 international grounds and expect all those grounds to be at the same level as the top international grounds around the world doesn’t work, does it? What are we all after? It is a sustainable game of cricket at club, county and international level. We all have to work together for that balance.
“One of the best things that happened to football was the reconstruction of Wembley because for a period of time England took their games around the country. They connected with more people. That is one of the unique factors of international cricket in England. It does get taken around the country and I think it is important to understand that not everybody has the spending capacity of those people who live in the South-East of the country. That has to be factored in when they are allocating matches. There is a finite amount of money that you can charge for cricket out in the provinces.” The cheapest adult ticket at Headingley on Friday for this match against New Zealand was £40 and Arthur has agreed he will review pricing policy before next year’s Test. The problem he has to solve is enticing the Yorkshire public back to the ground. There are more than 40,000 club cricketers in Yorkshire but selling international match tickets is a challenge for the club.
Headingley has a staging agreement with the ECB for regular England matches until 2019 but there are no guarantees after that, and Arthur knows a half-full ground does not project the right image.
“We have to make sure by that point [2019] people are seeing Headingley in a totally different light,” he said. “It is up to us to reinvent Headingley as the great cricket ground and stager of international cricket that it was in the past.
“We have to improve our ability to sell tickets, the capacity of the ground and the environment of the ground. The spectator experience when they first arrived at the gate is absolutely vital.”
Arthur intends to spend the winter visiting clubs to work out why there is a “disconnect” between Headingley and cricket supporters. “There must be something that is amiss. We have got work to do and we recognise that. Fundamentally we have to grow a base of cricket supporters who want to support cricket matches at Headingley. “Trent Bridge has proved once you are in a sell-out situation the demand for tickets is always that much greater. People always want a ticket for something they can’t get to and we have to improve our supporter base. We have to get more people engaged with Headingley and then we can start taking on other events.”

If you have school-age children, you're either bracing yourself for the end of term or tearing your hair out after a week or so of "I'm bored" echoing around the house. Even if you have a summer holiday booked, there will be several empty weeks to fill before you can pack off your charges for the new school year. So here is our guide to what's on in July and August, and some suggested child-friendly bolt-holes for a last-minute short break. Great child-friendly places to stay At the time of writing, all the following have availability on selected dates in July and August. Bedruthan Steps, Mawgan Porth, Cornwall Related Articles

Britain's best seaside restaurants
16 Jul 2011
Overlooking the sea and set above a classic north Cornwall surfing beach, the hotel is really well set up for children with indoor and outdoor pool, spa, surf school, golf nearby, indoor and outdoor play areas, children's clubs and high tea. From £365 a night for a family room sleeping four, including breakfast and dinner (01637 860787; www.bedruthan.com). Guesthouse East, Eastbourne, East Sussex Rent one of these stylishly decorated apartments, close to the beach, and you have the option of self-catering or b&b. £84 a night, self-catering, for two people, plus £5 a night for children under six, £10 for children aged between six and 16. Besides the usual seaside attractions, there are farm visits, cycling in Seven Sisters Country Park and the wonderful Drusilla's Zoo Park nearby (01323 722774; www.theguesthouseeast.co.uk). Calcot Manor, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire A very civilised Cotswolds hotel, where just one night can work wonders for frazzled parents. The secret is the Playzone, a large, free and staffed indoor playroom, with an adjoining Ofsted-registered crèche. Other facilities include a superb spa with indoor pool, an outdoor pool and play area, a large garden, children's high tea and an excellent restaurant. Check the website for late-availability offers announced for the following week; a typical price for a family room sleeping four is £315 a night with breakfast, plus £30 per child (01666 890391; www.calcotmanor.co.uk). Druidstone, Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire A relaxed and friendly small hotel that is likely to be full of families during the school holidays. This is emphatically not a designer hotel, and not all rooms are en suite, but it is quirky and charming, with one of the best sea views in Wales from its clifftop setting, and a wide beach with rock pools down below. The food is also very good. From £130 a night with breakfast for two adults and two children in adjoining rooms (01437 781221; www.druidstone.co.uk). Center Parcs, Whinfell Forest, Cumbria This is a good all-weather option for families. If it's dry, you can rent bikes to cycle through the forest, or sign up for activities including archery, falconry and sailing. If wet, there are indoor courses such as photography, and free use of the large subtropical "Swimming Paradise". From £499 for a three-night weekend stay in July, in a two-bedroom Woodland Lodge, sleeping four. See the website for details of similar breaks at Center Parcs in Sherwood, Longleat and Elveden forests (08448 267723; www.centerparcs.co.uk). Come to Good Farm, near Truro, Cornwall Families are encouraged to get involved in feeding chickens and collecting eggs at this friendly b&b on a working farm. The Eden Project and the Lost Gardens of Heligan are nearby. From £90 a night for a family of four, including a full farmhouse breakfast (01872 863828; www.cometogoodfarm.co.uk). Landmark Trust, London The trust rents out attractively restored self-catering houses and apartments in historic settings around the country, from follies to water towers. A range of short breaks is available throughout the summer. Properties include a Georgian house in Spitalfields, London, sleeping six (close to the Tower of London and the East End markets) from £905 for four nights, and an apartment in Hampton Court Palace, also sleeping six, from £1,062 for three nights, with full access to the public rooms and grounds. 01628 825925; www.landmarktrust.org.uk. The Lovestruck at Mohr, Lochearnhead, Perthshire Set on the banks of Loch Voil and in the grounds of the Mohr Hotel, this charmingly renovated horse truck (think gipsy caravan-cum-country cottage) sleeping four looks like something from a Roald Dahl story. There is plenty of space for children to let off steam, and you can treat yourself at the Mohr's celebrated restaurant. From £250 for two nights through Canopy & Stars (01275 395447; www.canopyandstars.co.uk), which offers a variety of other summer breaks. Ten great family days out Giffords Circus, Cotswolds A small, traditional and utterly charming touring circus of a sort that would once have graced England's commons and village greens in summer. This year the talented company of geese, tumbling pigeons, clowns and musicians are putting on War and Peace at the Circus, a family show inspired by Tolstoy's novel. At five venues in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire until September 11; adults £20, children £12 (0845 459 7469; www.giffordscircus.com). Chatsworth, Derbyshire Trailing round a historic house is likely to bore most children, but the grounds of some contain excellent adventure playgrounds. Chatsworth's woodland playground has dizzying slides, towers, rope bridges and giant sandpits – and a petting farm nearby. 01246 565300; www.chatsworth.org. There are also find good playgrounds at Groombridge Place Gardens in Kent (www.groombridge.co.uk), Harewood House near Leeds (www.harewood.org), and Wilton House (www.wiltonhouse.com) and Bowood (www.bowood.org), both in Wiltshire. Ironbridge Gorge, Shropshire The museums provide a tremendous day out for families and the highlight is Blists Hill, a re-creation of a Victorian town, which on July 30 and 31 is having a "Treasure Island" weekend. Actors will portray scenes of mutiny from Robert Louis Stevenson's book, children (who should come dressed as pirates) can follow a treasure trail and an old cargo boat will become the Hispaniola. Admission to all 10 museums costs £22.50 adults, £14.75 children, valid for a year (01952 433424; www.ironbridge.org.uk). Drayton Manor Theme Park, Tamworth, Staffs This is a good choice for families with big age gaps among the children. It has Thomas Land (yes, the tank engine) for younger children and satisfyingly gruesome rides such as Apocalypse for teenagers. For eight weeks from July 25 acrobatic divers will perform three shows a day, plunging from more than 80ft. Highlights include synchronised dives, clown dives and a fire dive. Park admission £32 adults, £25 under-12s (0844 472 1960; www.draytonmanor.co.uk). Imperial War Museum, London The brilliant exhibition Once Upon A Wartime brings children's stories about war dramatically to life. Wander through life-size sets of scenes from books including War Horse and Carrie's War and explore their themes of loyalty, separation, survival and identity. Adults £5.95, children £3.95, until October 30. From August 13 to 21 there will be a Children's Literature Festival, with talks by writers including Michael Morpurgo and workshops such as "Help Unpack an Evacuee's Suitcase" and "Make your own Warhorse Puppet" (020 7416 5320; www.iwm.org.uk). Blue Planet Aquarium, Cheshire It may not seem like the most natural suggestion for responsible parents, but one of the most exciting activities this summer has to be the Junior Shark Encounter at this Cheshire aquarium, which has the largest collection of sharks in Europe. Children aged eight to 15 – who need to be confident swimmers – can go nose to fin with some of the smaller residents, including blacktip reef sharks, in the nursery tank. The experience, which costs £140 per child, includes full instruction, dive equipment and free entry for an accompanying adult. The minimum height for participants is 1.25 metres (4ft 1¼in). (0151 357 8804; www.blueplanetaquarium.com). Summer days out in Britain: 11 of the best for families Bodiam Castle, Sussex Castles don't normally hold the interest of younger children for long, but at this spectacular setting in East Sussex on August 13 and 14 there will be sieges, gruesome battles, medieval minstrels and a history encampment to keep their attention. Battles include horseback jousting by the Knights of Arkley, a professional re-enactment group. Every day the castle will be opened in medieval style with a procession of men-at-arms and the "Black Knight". Admission £6.80 for adults, £3.40 children. Watch out too for the Knight and Princess Academy (suitable for ages four and over) on August 9 and 10 (01580 830196; www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-bodiamcastle). Lee Valley White Water Centre, Hertfordshire As the build-up grows to London 2012, there is a unique chance for teenagers aged 14 and over and their parents to get a taster of the Olympics at the site where the canoeing and kayaking events will take place. It is the only new London 2012 venue to open for public use. You can ride the rapids before the world's best athletes from August 7 (the site is closed until then to allow preparations for the canoe slalom). A White Water Rafting Adventure costs from £49 (08456 770606; www.gowhitewater.co.uk/whitewaterrafting). Conkers, National Forest Set in the heart of the National Forest, Conkers could be the ideal place in which to encourage a bit of self-sufficiency among your children. Crafts being taught every day by rangers on the 120 acres of land include shelter building, tracking and foraging. The programme runs from today until September 4. There is currently a 10 per cent discount for online bookings (01283 216633; www.visitconkers.com). Royal Armouries, Leeds There is an impressive range of events for children at the Royal Armouries (Britain's oldest museum) this summer, not least being Commando Kidz, an adventure zone with an inflatable assault course and magnetic climbing wall (£7.50 for a 60-minute session). Other highlights include a crossbow range and interactive displays showing what it would be like to ride into battle in full armour. Overall admission to the museum is free. The summer programme of events runs from July 23 to September 4 (0113 220 1999; www.royalarmouries.org). Summer days out in Britain: 11 of the best for families Five family festivals All prices are for a weekend with camping. Port Eliot This literary festival, held on a Cornish estate, offers comedy, films in an open-air cinema and swimming in the River Lynher. In the rhododendron garden is The Hullabaloo, a place for children to exercise their imagination and enter a world of fairies, giants and pirates. The Rogue Theatre group is planning performances, puppet shows, dance and jewellery-making workshops. There will also be Victorian fairground games and a poetry takeaway where leading poets will write personalised verse to order. July 21–24, Port Eliot Estate, St Germans, Cornwall (www.porteliotfestival.com). Adults £140, under-16s £70, under-eights free. Camp Bestival A good choice if you want to combine a family atmosphere with top-quality bands and DJs. This year's diverse musical highlights include Primal Scream, Blondie, House of Pain and Groove Armada. Attractions for children include a teddy bears' picnic, appearances from Dick and Dom, live performances by Shrek the Musical, Sooty and Sweep and The Gruffalo, plus dedicated theatre and comedy sessions. July 28–31, Lulworth Castle, Dorset (www.campbestival.net). Adults £170, under-18s £85, under-11s free. WOMAD This world music gathering has an on-site arboretum filled with art and plenty of activities for children, making it a firm family favourite. Parents can soothe away camping aches and pains in the spa, while little ones can create their own masterpieces and take part in music workshops, culminating in a site-wide carnival procession. This year, there is music from Rodrigo y Gabriela, Bellowhead and Gogol Bordello as well as many other acts from abroad. The programme also promises exotic food and cookery lessons. July 28–31, Charlton Park, Malmesbury, Wiltshire (www.womad.org). Adults £135, ages 14-17 £70, under-14s free. Croissant Neuf Summer Party A solar-powered big top is the focus of this independent festival, which can trace its sustainable roots back to the Green Fields area at Glastonbury. Its attempts to be a low-impact event are impressive: three trees are planted for every car that arrives. Attractions include silly Olympic games, workshops, crafts, a treasure hunt and a lantern parade. The festival is held in a secret location in the rolling Monmouthshire hills. August 12–14, near Usk, Monmouthshire, Wales (www.partyneuf.co.uk). Adults £88, under-17s £35, under-sixes free (family discounts also available). Festinho An oversized garden party with a Brazilian theme and charitable aims, set in the grounds of a manor house. Croquet is played on the lawn; a wander in the woods reveals giant games of Mousetrap and Hungry Hippos. The main stage is enclosed in a walled garden and indoors there are a café, bar and cinema to escape to should it rain. Sleeping bags are required for human caterpillar racing and there is also a bonfire for marshmallow-toasting plus a nightly fireshow and "silent disco". August 26–28, Hinwick House, Bedfordshire (www.festinho.com). Adults £90, under-16s £45, under-fives free. Guide compiled by Joanna Symons, Natalie Paris and Jolyon Attwooll UK
