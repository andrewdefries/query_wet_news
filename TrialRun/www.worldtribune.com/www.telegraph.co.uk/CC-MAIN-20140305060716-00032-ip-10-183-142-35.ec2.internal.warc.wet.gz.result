James Dyson Awards: finalist inventions
A pneumatic gun that fires an emergency buoyancy aid beat a device that uses natural sunlight to make seawater drinkable and an invention that assists paramedics

One of Britain's most respected designers has called on the Government to do more to encourage young people to embark on an engineering career. Sir James Dyson, the inventor of the world-famous eponymous bagless vacuum cleaner, said: "We produce about 22,000 engineers a year but we have vacancies for 37,000. So we must do a lot to encourage young people to read sciences and design technology at school and then to go on at university to produce the brains and the brilliant ideas that we need to create wealth for our country."
Sir James was speaking exclusively to the Telegraph as the winner of The James Dyson Award 2010 was announced. The annual international design award is run by the James Dyson Foundation, a charitable trust. The inventor added that the Government “must take engineering seriously. When it comes to big infrastructure projects or building submarines or buses the Government should encourage it and early fund it and show industry and universities that engineering matters to this country. It’s a vital part of our economy.”

Save £1,500 a year by planning meals, says Department of Health
Families could save as much as £1,500 a year and improve their diet simply by planning their weekly food shop better, according to the Department of Health.
By Martin Beckford, Social Affairs Editor

It found that households bought fewer takeaways, snacked less often and ate more fruit and veg after being given meal-planning advice.
The NHS's healthy lifestyle campaign Change4Life asked 20 households to record what they ate and drank over a fortnight. After the first week the 10 families, five couples and five single people in the survey were given basic tips such as how to write a shopping list and plan meals for the week ahead.
In the second week of the experiment, they saved an average of £29 including spending £15 less on takeaways as well as eating more regular meals and fewer snacks. Over the course of a year this could mean savings of up to £1,508.
The majority (85 per cent) of those who took part said they would continue to plan weekly meals in the future.
Anne Milton, the Public Health Minister, said: “If you're busy and on a budget, you can still eat well. “Some people might think that eating a balanced diet is more expensive but that does not have to be the case. If we plan ahead we can make better choices and save money too. “In the new year we will launch a new Change4Life Supermeals campaign that will help everyone plan and cook simple meals.”

Internet shame is killing our children
Adolescents aren't emotionally equipped to deal with embarrassment, and when they are exposed online the consequences can be tragic, as the suicide of Daniel Perry shows

It can sometimes be difficult, as an adult, to remember the routine intensity of one’s feelings as a teenager. It’s like trying to recall extreme physical pain, or the first insanity of falling in love. Your mind chases after it, remembering the shape of the dent it left in your psyche, but only a trace of it drifts back to you, like a faded scent.
Still, I can recall being much more self-conscious, and at the same time more sarcastic towards others. Teenagers are all too aware that they have a soft, malleable centre – before the trappings of adulthood harden around them – and they grope for things to protect them: sharp words, groups, philosophies, hotly disputed rules of behaviour. One of the things that shielded teenagers when I was growing up, though, was the concept of privacy; every personality needs a patch of shade in which to grow.
We didn’t have email, of course, or texting, camera-phones, Facebook or Twitter or any of the myriad sites such as Ask.fm which seem now to have become fertile grounds for the growth of peer-to-peer cruelty. There was no concept of “sexting”. If you wanted to take a photograph, you had to get out a bulky camera and click. A professional adult developed the film for you, and questions would have been asked if anything untoward had appeared on the prints.
If you did or said something stupid, it was unlikely that anyone would remember it in a fortnight, much less provide concrete evidence. The memory of your mistakes drifted on the air, on gossip and rumour and fallings-outs. The past could disperse like smoke. Within reason, you always had the option of escaping a former version of yourself.
Not any more, and teenagers know it. There was something so intensely sad about the picture last week of Daniel Perry, the 17-year-old Dunfermline boy who killed himself last July after falling prey to blackmailers on Skype. He had such an open, cheerful face, so ready for life’s possibilities.

Daniel, an apprentice mechanic, had spent much time on Skype talking to someone he believed to be an American girl his own age; it seems he was drawn into some form of sexual indiscretion, as many boys would be. Then the blackmailers revealed themselves, and viciously threatened to make the Skype material (or a manipulated version of it) public unless he deposited money in a named bank account.
The news must have stunned him, and filled him with the fear of being publicly humiliated. He asked them: “What can I do to stop you showing this to my family?”. Then he jumped off the Forth Road Bridge to his death.
There is something uniquely excruciating about the threat of such exposure for teenagers; they are still working out their responses to the opposite sex, treading on delicate ground. At best, their feelings are easily bruised. And for all the obsession of our society with talking about the mechanics of sex, the potential for shame around it, particularly for young people, has not diminished.
Shame can destroy people as surely as poison; it is the most ancient and powerful of emotions. The real shame, of course, should be on those who cruelly or thoughtlessly blast apart the private lives of others. Daniel is not the first to be killed by the threat of private activities being made public. In a much-discussed case in the US, a college freshman called Tyler Clementi jumped off a bridge to his death in 2010 after discovering that his room-mate had set up a webcam in their shared room, and live-streamed footage of Clementi in sexual activity with a boyfriend. Clementi had only recently told his family he was gay.
A 13-year-old London schoolgirl called Chevonea Kendall-Bryan fell to her death from a tower block in 2011 while desperately pleading with a boy to delete a video taken of her in allegedly coerced sexual activity. And a 15-year-old called Audrie Pott in Saratoga, in the US, killed herself in 2012 after three boys allegedly assaulted her when she was drunk and took pictures that they later showed around. Compromising images can now be captured so casually that in some cases adolescent persecutors have deluded themselves into thinking that what they are doing is no big deal: the effect upon their victims, however, is devastating.
The names pile up of teenagers tormented by the circulation – or possible circulation – of images beyond their control. What can adults do? We can try to warn them to confine sexual exploration only to circumstances and people they can fully trust. We can try to rebuild some communal understanding of the rules of privacy, and strengthen them against embarrassment. Still, it feels increasingly like trying to provide a safe map for a minefield.
Daniel’s Twitter account still stands. He talks about liking horses and Big Macs and Chinese food. His description of himself says: “I try not to take life too seriously.” I only wish that part had been true. Wine wisdom starts in your glass
The Government has been so alarmed by levels of middle-class wine drinking, it was reported last week, that it has recommended the definition of “wine” be expanded across the European Union to include low-alcohol and no-alcohol beverages which would not previously have merited the term.
Although France, Spain and Portugal are vigorously opposing the idea, the UK has promised to keep on pursuing it, in what a government spokesman called the “best long-term interests” of consumers (by which he means, I imagine, a reduction in damage to the beleaguered internal organs of enthusiastic British tipplers).
The renaming of wine, however, smacks of desperation. In my childhood, those adults who wanted wine on special occasions drank it, and those who didn’t – but wanted to look celebratory – happily drank fizzy grape juice in a wine glass.
But now, it seems, British professionals, in particular (statistically, the most tireless wine drinkers) have got into the habit of cracking open a bottle at “wine o’clock” most evenings, and carrying on merrily until bedtime. Their idea seems to be that wine-drinking doesn’t count as proper, damaging drinking, but is more of a kind of benevolent liquid homage to a European lifestyle. Doctors beg to differ.
Yet, rather than tampering with the integrity of wine, why not simply return glasses to the modest size they once were before those giant fish bowls on glass stalks grew popular in the Nineties, and a “glass” came to mean a quarter of a litre? Nutritionists are always saying that the one sure way to limit food intake painlessly is simply to eat from a smaller plate. I have a feeling that much the same applies to drink. Protest? Throw the other one
I hope that Ed Miliband’s dry-cleaner has an arsenal of efficient stain removers: the Labour leader’s suit was splattered with egg once again last week, as he toured a London street market (the last time it took a hit was in Southampton last May). To his credit, he maintained his sangfroid, shrugged off his jacket and continued with the walkabout, while the egg-thrower – whom I deliberately will not name – gave an interview to the BBC about his reasons for attacking the Labour leader.
They were predictably vague: he didn’t “believe” Mr Miliband; he was angry about “weapons of mass deception”; the poor are seen as “a burden”. Still, fair enough: so why not write a letter, vote, hold up a placard, join a protest, start a petition, stand for political office? Ruining someone’s jacket with uncooked omelette seems an odd way to promote change.
But I then don’t think that egg-throwers are really concerned with change: for all its overtones of popular, medieval protest, a fiercely flung egg in a democracy is just a nasty little form of self-righteous assault. Such actions are a reminder that the alternative to having MPs who plod through the slow detail of constituency meetings and committees is missile-chucking mob rule: when I see a politician with egg on his or her face, my respect for the job soars.
