A tale of hardihood to stir any man's heart Twitter is an adolescent craze - but it could bring to the attention of a new generation the heroism of Captain Scott, says Simon Heffer.

Comments
I would be lying if I said I understood, or was even especially interested in, the phenomenon of Twitter. However, I am exceptionally interested in Captain Scott, whose journals are to be disseminated through this medium, 99 years after they were begun. This interesting event provides an opportunity not to think about yet another craze for adolescents of all ages but to think about Scott, and people like him, and the place that type holds in our history and our culture.It is unclear where the modernist, postmodernist and revisionist schools of history have left Scott. Biographies over the past 40 or so years have portrayed him as a bungler, a man with defective strategic sense, someone who led some of his men through negligence to their deaths. In recent years, the tide of nit‑picking unpleasantness seems to have been reversed – Scott turned out to have been only human, with all that entails.It is tempting to think of him as obstinate, foolish, deluded, reckless. Some of us prefer to see in him that spark of genius which, if it ignites, is hailed by everyone as, well, genius, but which, if it goes wrong, is dismissed as madness or failure. The possibility of failure – which became more than a possibility in Scott's case – should not deter us from hailing and admiring such people. It is only by their desire to take risks that the human race ever achieves anything.Risks. That word reminds us of Scott's most famous words: not an entry in that journal but his "Message to the Public", which was found with his body and those of his companions months after he perished at the South Pole. "We took risks, we knew that we took them; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last." It continued: "Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale, but surely, surely, a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for." Those last words echo the famous last entry of the journal itself: "For God's sake look after our people."Scott reached the Pole early in 1912, to find that Roald Amundsen had got there before him. The blow was hard: harder still the impossibility of the return journey before the darkness and intensity of the southern winter set in. Scott is thought to have died on March 29 1912, and it is deduced that he was the last to go.It is thanks, too, to his journal that we know of the heroism of Captain Oates: "I am just going outside and may be some time." Oates, like his comrades debilitated by the cold, hunger, exhaustion and snow‑blindness, could hardly walk because of a problem with an old wound, and took himself off to die to ease the burden on the others. This was almost a fortnight before the others died, but they were marooned and the weather was closing in.Although Amundsen had the honour of getting to the Pole first, he seems to have come off rather badly in the glory stakes. Scott, in an age long before the value of the spin-doctor or the soundbite became apparent, made his own myth: whether consciously or unconsciously is a matter for conjecture.When his writings were brought home, his status as a hero, and that of those who died with him, was settled until the cynicism-drenched 1960s. Barely a year before the Great War, Britain and her empire had the ultimate role model. His was an example of the endurance, courage, guts and stoicism that were supposedly the hallmarks of the British character. Generations of small boys, and small girls too, would be inspired by the story of his heroism.Best of all, it was a very British heroism: he failed. He was second to the Pole and he never made it home. However, unlike the success of Amundsen – who was first, and who did – his failure was gilt with monumental glory. He failed like a gentleman, and that was part of the message that was impressed on those generations of children, too. The era of the satire boom found such things preposterously laughable. Our own era, which watches its men dying in foreign places in the name of Queen and country, is perhaps more ready to take Scott at his contemporaries' estimation of him than any for half a century.There is a superb representation of the expedition from the age just before cynicism, and that is the Ealing Studios film Scott of the Antarctic, made in colour in 1948 with stunning music by Vaughan Williams. It was appropriate that Ealing made the film just after a bloody war, and just before it and the rest of the British film industry went on a binge of films about that war right through the 1950s. In a time when the victors of the war felt as hard done by as the defeated, when austerity prevailed and struggle had not abated but simply assumed a different form, this starched upper lip film reminded everyone of how real adversity had been confronted, and the inspiration that was to be drawn from it, even in death. The film still turns up on television once or twice a year, and may be as close as many of us can come to understanding what the expedition was like, the ordeal it represented, and the courage with which that ordeal was, in the end, faced.Whether or not Scott was a hero, and a man to be admired and looked up to, is for each individual who learns his story to judge. I am not sure it is wise for anyone for discount bloody-mindedness and obstinacy as important parts of our national character: they were useful before Scott exhibited them, and invaluable in the two world wars. In Scott's case these qualities (for qualities they are) are attacked because of the deaths of the other men, and Scott's imagined responsibility for that.But they were all volunteers: they all took risks, and all knew that they took them. Each man exercised his own will, his own spirit of adventure, and prepared to take the consequences upon himself: even if Scott's last act of leadership was to implore others to have a care for "our people". If Twitter drums into the heads of a new generation that sense of daring, and of chivalry, then none of us should have any cause for complaint. Simon Heffer

Europe 'falling behind US and blighted by energy costs'
Europe is falling dangerously far behind the US in productivity growth and is blighted by crippling energy costs, the pan-EU industry federation has warned.
'Shale gas is a game-changer and we need to have a discussion based on the evidence, not based on risks' Photo: PA	By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard

“Europe doesn’t have an energy policy. It has a climate policy,” said Markus Beyrer, head of BusinessEurope. Mr Beyrer said the US is running away with the shale energy revolution, leaving Europe’s companies in the dust. Spot gas prices are now four to five times higher in Europe, with grim implications for the chemical industry. “Shale gas is a game-changer and we need to have a discussion based on the evidence, not based on risks,” Mr Beyrer told The Daily Telegraph. France has imposed a moratorium on shale exploration and few countries have yet to take decisive action.
Mr Beyrer said Europe’s carbon trading scheme is a muddle with “mutually distorting objectives” that drive up energy costs without much benefit for the climate. The latest twist is a switch to coal by EU power companies, playing havoc with CO2 goals.
“Nobody is happy. The US and even China are making more progress with renewable targets than we are,” he said.

Equally worrying, he said, is that Europe is slipping further behind in industrial efficiency, chiefly due to rigid labour markets. “Labour productivity in US manufacturing has increased by 1.8pc since the early 2000s, compared with 0.66pc in the Euro Area,” he added.
The transatlantic gap in economic growth reached 2.6pc last year after the eurozone crashed back into recession, the highest since 1993. Citigroup expects the gap to widen further to 3.4pc by 2014 as EMU remains stuck in slump, with extreme levels continuing into the latter part of the decade. This will have profound compound effects. Euroland’s overall GDP will slip from 78pc of US levels to 66pc by 2025. “We expect very different recovery paths, reflecting differing policy choices,” said the bank.
America’s per capita income will be 9-10pc higher than the 2007 level by 2017; the eurozone’s will be 3-4pc lower, worse than Japan’s Lost Decade.
The problems facing the eurozone were underlined on Tuesday with figures showing that German exports fell in February. Exports fell by 1.5pc compared with January of this year and by 2.8 pc from February 2012, official figures said.
In France, the second biggest eurozone economy, the trade deficit widened as a drop in exports was not made up for by a bigger drop in imports.

BP attack in Algeria 'linked to French military deployment in Mali'
With France mounting military operations against Islamists in Mali, it is "too much of a coincidence" that al-Qaeda linked militants have killed a Briton and kidnapped 40 others at an oil facility in neighbouring Algeria, according to the Telegraph's Diplomatic Correspondent. 5:40PM GMT 16 Jan 2013
Algeria BP attack: latest Algeria's official APS news agency cited provincial officials for news of the death, which came after an early morning attack by Islamists. The militants say they are holding an seven Americans and an unspecified number of British, Japanese and French amongst other nationalities, a spokesman is cited as saying by two Mauritanian news agencies - Agence Nouakchott information and Sahara Medias. A security source quoted by Algeria's El Watan newspaper quoted the same figure. The attack comes the same day as France ramped up military operations against Islamist forces in neighbouring Mali, and it is likely the two events are linked, says the Telegraph's Diplomatic Correspondent Alex Spillius. "It seems much too much of a coincidence that this attack on the BP facility would just happen anyway, although it is true that jihadist and Islamist groups in Mali and Algeria have been threatening to attack French interests for some time," says Alex Spillius.
