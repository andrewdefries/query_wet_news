Comments
This recipe has all the rich, creamy texture of ice cream with none of the dairy or sugar. The crunchy topping is a snap to put together and is so, so good. Makes about 1 pint 4 ripe bananas, peeled and sliced into thin rounds 30g (1¼oz) finely chopped roasted almonds 2 tsp plus 2 tbsp good-quality maple syrup
Pinch of coarse sea salt 120ml (4fl oz) unsweetened almond milk 1 tsp pure vanilla extract Freeze the banana slices in a single layer on a tray or plate lined with parchment or wax paper. Once the slices are frozen, use them immediately or keep frozen in a zip-top plastic bag or airtight container for up to a month. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the almonds with 2 tsp of the maple syrup and the pinch of salt and set the mixture aside. Combine the frozen banana slices, the almond milk, the remaining 2 tbsp of the maple syrup, and the vanilla in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is the texture of soft ice cream, scraping down the sides as necessary. Don’t worry if the mixture is not totally smooth at first - once the bananas start to break down and defrost in the food processor, they’ll give in and the ‘ice cream’ will take shape quickly. Spoon the banana ‘ice cream’ into bowls immediately and sprinkle each serving with a bit of the almond mixture. 'It’s All Good' by Gwyneth Paltrow and Julia Turshen is published by Sphere at £20

Allotments thefts rise as credit crisis causes vegetable crimewave Allotments have been targeted by vegetable thieves, as more people grow their own produce in response to the credit crisis. By Harry Wallop, Consumer Affairs Correspondent 4:39PM BST 26 Jun 2008
Allotments have enjoyed a boom few years, with many people seeing their gardening as a way of saving on fruit and vegetable bills.However, it would now seem that thieves are taking advantage of this green revolution.Rhubarb, potatoes and onions were part of a haul stolen from an allotment in Cheslyn Hay, near Cannock, while other sites in the region have also reported thefts of produce.Allan Rees, chairman of the National Society of Allotments and Leisure Gardening, is concerned the problem could get worse as the economic outlook worsens."Families are getting poorer and this is one way of putting food on the table," he said. "I believe they are being sold on. Thieves stole potatoes from my own plot and put the stalks back in place so it was two or three days before I noticed."

"There is a Zeppelin museum in Germany, but that has much bigger things, such as engines. I wanted to make a museum it had to appeal to everybody so there are children's things and jokey things. But now I'm too old so I'm selling it. All the money will go to charity - to the elderly on Jersey."

Egypt unrest continues as protesters try to occupy Tahrir Square
Clashes resumed in Cairo on Saturday between police and demonstrators trying to occupy Tahrir Square in protest at authoritarian new powers seized by President Mohammed Morsi. Image 1 of 2	The protesters in Tahrir Square have been dominated by the young, secular liberals and leftists who triggered last year's revolution Photo: Mohammed Asad/AP	Image 1 of 2	Opponents say Mr Morsi's 52 per cent is not enough support to take the radical path he's gone for Photo: Andre Pain/EPA	By Richard Spencer, Cairo
5:22PM GMT 24 Nov 2012
Follow Police fired tear gas, as they had on Friday evening as protesters hurled stones and set a school near the interior ministry on fire.
Mr Morsi was unrepentant over his move to make his decisions unchallengeable in the courts – a ruling announced on Thursday in the wake of his success in negotiating a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel. His Muslim Brotherhood backers called for a mass rally in his support on Tuesday.
But he came under pressure from Egypt's judges, who were sidelined in the declaration. Mr Morsi stopped all further legal challenges to the committee drawing up a new constitution, sacked the prosecutor-general, and decreed that all his own decisions were beyond challenge also until a new parliament was elected.
The Supreme Judicial Council held an emergency meeting to declare that the decision was "an unprecedented attack on the independence of the judiciary and its rulings".
Mr Morsi's declaration also came under fire from Egypt's backers in the West.

"The decisions and declarations announced on November 22 raise concerns for many Egyptians and for the international community," the US state department said.
"One of the aspirations of the revolution was to ensure that power would not be overly concentrated in the hands of any one person or institution."
On Friday, demonstrators ransacked and burned down offices of the Brotherhood's political front, the Freedom and Justice Party, in Alexandria, Port Said and Ismailiya.
In Cairo, the biggest demonstrations for months filled Tahrir Square, reviving the spirit and chants of last year's revolution against former leader, ex-President Hosni Mubarak.
"Out, out," the crowd chanted. "The people want the downfall of the regime."
Mr Morsi told a crowd of supporters gathered in front of the presidential palace that he was trying to stop a "minority" trying to "block the revolution".
He alleged that money stolen under the old regime was being used to fund new protests, including by "thugs" – a politically loaded term suggesting that the pro-democracy protesters were the same as Mr Mubarak's hired henchmen.
"There are weevils eating away at the nation of Egypt," he told them. He said he was trying to assure "political stability, social stability and economic stability".
"I have always been, and still am, and will always be, God willing, with the pulse of the people, what the people want, with clear legitimacy," he said.
The protesters in Tahrir Square have been dominated by the young, secular liberals and leftists who triggered last year's revolution but were later sidelined by deep support for Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood and the more purist Salafis.
However, Mr Morsi was only able to win 52 per cent of the vote in the election that brought him to power in June, which opponents say is not enough to give him the mandate necessary for the radical steps he has taken. They now believe they can capitalise on widespread dissatisfaction with the speed of economic and social progress since Mr Morsi became president.
"I reject all these decisions," said Reem Ahmed, 32. She was holding up a placard saying, "I am a dead man," in solidarity with two victims of earlier protests this week, shot by police. "The country is in danger.
"We gave Mr Morsi a chance. But now we have had enough."
Ahmed Hassan, 36, an oil company worker, said: "We don't accept this new constitution. It gives him more power than a pharaoh."
Mr Morsi's handling of the truce negotiations, which have won him praise from across the world, including the White House, is less of an issue in Egypt, where most people are more concerned with crime and the state of the economy. Many also actively oppose continuing relations with Israel in the first place.
"I voted for Morsi last year, but now he is a dictator," said Shaabel Abu Talib, 55, who runs a small business. "We have now discovered that he is also an American agent. He is playing the same role negotiating with Israel as Mubarak did."
The president in part justified his declaration as a response to calls for new prosecutions of those responsible for shooting protesters last year. He said there would be new trials of "political and executive figures".
But a more hardline group of protesters, more working class and including some relatives of those who were killed last year, continued to attack the interior ministry. On Thursday night they burned a school being used as a base by police.
"Morsi is not responding to the revolutionaries," said Faris, 27, a driver, who was wearing a bandanna saying "Remember the Martyrs". "He is making decisions based on his own opinions and of those who fund him."
Mr Morsi and his Brotherhood supporters are convinced that the secular opposition is in a minority. His spokesmen also took to Twitter, a sign of the greater political sophistication of the new leadership compared to the dictatorship which it replaced, to insist the declaration was a temporary measure.
"All constitutional declarations become void once a constitution is in place," said Gehad al-Haddad, a Muslim Brotherhood adviser.

Crosswords could knock 10 years off brain and delay dementia
Training the brain with puzzles and crossword could delay the onset of cognitive decline in old age, keeping the mind of an 80-year-old as sharp of someone 10 years younger, researchers claim
By Sarah Knapton, Science Correspondent
7:00AM GMT 14 Jan 2014

Crosswords and puzzles could knock 10 years off the age of the brains of older people and even delay dementia by keeping the mind sharp, researchers believe.
A 10 year study looking at the benefits of brain training found nearly three quarters of those who took displayed cognitive benefits a decade on.
Researchers said the findings were ‘pretty astounding’ and advised that pastimes like maths puzzles or crosswords can keep the mind ticking over like a 70-year-old when you get to 80.
Studies have long pointed towards the benefits of keeping the brain active later in life, but this is the first of its kind to show how a little training goes such a long way.
The US study involved 2,800 participants, the largest of its kind so far, and they had an average age of 74.

Participants were split into four groups: some received brain training focusing on processing speed, others on memory and others on reasoning ability.
A fourth group did not get any brain training.
All four groups were given 10 sessions lasting 60 to 70 minutes over five or six weeks and nothing else for the next decade.
The effects were measured at intervals over the next 10 years.
The findings showed that around 60 per cent of those who participated in the brain drills reported they had less difficulty with day-to-day activities such as shopping and handling their finances, compared to 49 per cent of those who did not have the training.
George Rebok, an expert on aging and a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and lead author, said: "What we found was pretty astounding.
"Ten years after the training, there was evidence the effects were durable for the reasoning and the speed training."
Study co-author Sharon Tennstedt, vice president of New England Research Institutes, said: ‘If these training interventions can have that kind of effect on preserving cognitive function, then there is potential for either delaying dementia or kind of attenuating it’.
Some 500,000 people in the UK are affected by Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia.
Previous research has found a lower risk of Alzheimer's among people who frequently go to the theater, read or play games such as cards.
Going to a museum, dancing and playing a musical instrument had a positive effect, as did regular social interaction.
The latest study appeared appears in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society .

The Masters 2013: Angel Cabrera pays tribute to Adam Scott 'a great person and truly a good winner’
For Adam Scott, it was the culmination of a lifetime’s work. “I don’t know how that happened,” he said after winning the 2013 Masters, becoming the first Australian ever to win the champion’s green jacket.

“It’s incredible to be in this position. I’m honoured. I had some lucky today, I don’t know how to digest it all. It seems a long way from a couple of years ago here.” That day he was beaten into second place by an astonishing late surge from Charl Schwartzel. What could Angel Cabrera say? He had thrown all he could at Scott, but after winning here in 2009, he ended this Masters tournament as a beaten foe. He reacted with typical class. “That’s golf,” he said. “I had some issues on the course, but I came back. That’s how golf is. I had that chip on 18 where I could have won it. "But Adam is truly a good winner. Obviously I would have been happier if I’d won, but he’s a great person and a great player. Related Articles

"We’ve been together in Presidents Cups, and I’m happy for him.”
And then there was the third man, Jason Day. This was the third time he had placed in a major without winning, after finishing runner-up here and at the US Open in 2011. “It’s a little disappointing, but there’s a lot of experience that I can take into next year,” he said. “Hopefully I can wear one of those green jackets soon.”

Facebook results: 'the social media bubble bursts' Facebook’s disappointing first results as a public company are a sure sign that the ‘social media bubble’ has burst, according to technology analysts.

Yesterday the social network’s shares slumped to a record low after its maiden results as a publicly traded company showed its growth had slowed.
The Californian company had been under intense pressure to deliver strong results given the almost 30pc drop in its share price since the $104bn (£66bn) flotation in May. Although revenues climbed 32pc to $1.18bn in the second quarter, beating analysts' estimates, it failed to convince investors who had seen saw revenues climb 45pc in the first quarter. At the same time its spending on sales and marketing more than tripled to $392m in the period. Ian Maude, head of Internet at Enders Analysis, described Facebook’s first results as the moment which investors finally "got to see the money and the real state of affairs".
“This is the proof that there is a social media bubble,” he said. “Those investors who piled in at $38 were on a hiding to nothing. Revenue growth even before Facebook’s IPO wasn’t there to support that valuation. People bought shares at those inflated prices based on the idea that Facebook was the new Google. It isn’t.

Facebook shares tumble 15pc on growth fears

“Google’s display revenues alone this year will be larger than Facebook’s entire revenue.”
Having sold shares at $38 each on May 17, they tumbled as much as 12 per cent to $23.75 in extended trading in New York. David Ebersman, Facebook's chief financial officer, said that "we are disappointed how the stock is trading".
As had been forecast, the cost of share-based pay plan for employees saw Facebook report an overall loss of $157m for the quarter. But as founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg made an appearance on the company's conference call with Wall Street analysts on last night night, the focus was squarely on how quickly the social network site will be able to drive revenues.
Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's highly-regarded chief operating officer, were at pains to stress that the company had introduced several initiatives to squeeze more revenue from a base of users that grew 29 per cent to 955m by the end of the quarter. That included the launch of advertising known as ‘sponsored stories’ in the newsfeeds that Facebook users get when they access their accounts. By the end of June, they were generating about $1m a day in advertising, with half of that coming from mobile devices, said Sandberg. Total advertising revenues rose 28pc to $992m in the quarter.
However, Maude said the biggest problem confronting Facebook was mobile.
“The issue is Facebook’s revenue growth which has slowed down over the last 12 months and the real worry is it’s not going to be able to turn it around. Plus the revenue per user is pretty flat.
“But its biggest problem is monetising mobile. As more and more of its users access Facebook on mobiles, the social network must prove it can monetise mobile if it is to dramatically grow revenues. So far it has not proved it can monetise the small screen. Sponsored stories are a start, but we are very sceptical about display adverts on the mobile screen.”
Last night Zuckerberg denied reports that Facebook was considering building its own phone, arguing it "wouldn't make much sense for us".
In May earlier this year, a week before its Wall Street flotation, Facebook warned investors that the rapid growth of its mobile apps threatens its long-term financial prospects as users increasingly desert their desktops.
Facebook said the number of users of its and apps for smartphones and tablets was growing quicker than the number of adverts it is serving up because it has not developed its mobile advertising strategy.
“We believe this increased usage of Facebook on mobile devices has contributed to the recent trend of our daily active users increasing more rapidly than the increase in the number of ads delivered,” a Facebook spokesman said at the time.
However, Vanessa Barnett, technology and media partner at law firm Charles Russell, sees the social network's maiden results as a public company in a more positive light. She said: “The high level picture is that [Facebook’s] revenue is up, hitting 1.18 billion dollars. That is a business success, whichever way you cut it. "There will be many Facebook 'Grinches' that linger on the two key negatives (margin down from 53 per cent to 43 per cent and that costs and expenses up by almost 300%) but their schadenfreude would be entirely misplaced. Margin will for the moment be trickier because there is less space on mobile to view ads. Costs and expenses are obviously up because of payments arising out of employee share schemes and the IPO.
"I see the results very positively and in the context of the internet market as a whole. Everyone is using Facebook, everyone is going mobile in terms of how they connect with their friends and how they consume information and content. Facebook has become a utility in our daily lives and now it's really about how Facebook executes on that.
"The results reveal some positive data that Facebook is heading in the right direction, in particular there are impressive statistics on return on investment in advertising, which 49% of audited campaigns returning five times spend. This is impressive. Alongside that Facebook continues to innovate for users, for example, purchasing Instagram, launching Facebook Exchange - all steps towards success and growth.”
