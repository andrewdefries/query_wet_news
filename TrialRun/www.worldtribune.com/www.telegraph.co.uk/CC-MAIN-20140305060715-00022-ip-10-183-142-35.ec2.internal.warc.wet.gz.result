Family Book Club: Little Darlings by Jacqueline Wilson Dame Jacqueline Wilson has produced a tale of true life grit for the X Factor generation Tears and smiles: Dame Jacqueline Wilson Photo: NAOMI COOPER	By Christopher Middleton 12:10PM GMT 09 Mar 2010
Comments
Our book of the month for March is a tale of two daughters. On the one hand, there's Destiny, who lives in a run-down part of Manchester, with an ailing mother who works around the clock to pay the mortgage. And then there's Sunset, who lives in luxury in Surrey, with her ageing rock star father, her neurotically glamorous mother, plus little sister, Sweetie, and baby brother, Ace.
Although they live worlds apart, the two heroines of Dame Jacqueline Wilson's novel Little Darlings have one thing in common, the same father. For Sunset's celebrity father, the now slightly desperate rocker Danny Kilman, is also Destiny's father, thanks to a brief romance with her mother back in the Nineties.
Not that he has any inkling of this at the start of the book, but by the end of this moving saga – part fable, part satire, part all-too-real-life – the two families have not just met, but collided head-on. Amid the hysteria, the recriminations and the amplified vanity of the adults, the two still-small voices of calm belong to Destiny and Sunset.
It is, of course, a Jacqueline Wilson trademark that instead of getting rid of the grown-ups early on, as other children's writers do, she puts them in the middle of the action. And they don't always come out well. "Because children today don't go out as much in the street to play, they are with their parents more than they used to," she says. "They see them close up and, on occasions, are exposed to the realisation that their mother and father don't always know best."
Just as when poor Sunset hears her father plotting over the phone to run away with his latest illicit girlfriend, and returns to the playroom with the report, "Dad's planning to dump us".
Hardly the fluffy-rabbit stuff of traditional children's books, but Dame Jacqueline stands by her subject matter. "The thing is, every child today knows at least one other child whose parents have split up," she says. "This is a part of children's lives today, and I try and portray what's happening now.
"My view is that a mixed diet of reading is lovely. Children who enjoy my books also tell me they enjoy Harry Potter, for example, and Ballet Shoes: there's room for all stories.
"In this book, for example, children get to imagine what it's like to live both on a rough council estate and in a mansion with a guitar-shaped swimming pool. They are also introduced to the notion that you can have all the money and attention in the world, and still might not be having that jolly a time."
As demonstrated by the world of celebrity in which Sunset and her family are trapped. A world where mother and father hide their tears and unhappiness from the cameras, where the guests at little Sweetie's birthday party are all either child models or the offspring of other artists on her dad's record label, and where the birthday girl isn't allowed to open her presents until the photographer from the glossy magazine has arrived.
"I don't actually know any children of celebrities, but it seems to me they all have extraordinary names and extraordinary lives," says Dame Jacqueline. "Of course, I understand the value of publicity and image, but I am concerned about the way in which young girls are so influenced by looks. Sunset is always being made to feel bad about her crooked teeth by her mother and, as a result, feels very insecure, especially about smiling. By contrast, Destiny has the same teeth, but because her mother has never made an issue about it, she's not in the least bit bothered by them.
"The biggest thing that bothers me about celebrity culture, though, is when I ask children what they want to be, and they reply, 'Rich and famous'.
"If nothing else, I hope this book will plant the idea that if everything in your life becomes public property, the result might be nowhere near as exciting as you might think."
Little Darlings (Random House) is available from Telegraph Books at £11.99 plus £1.25 p&p (0844 871 1515). Find out about Jacqueline Wilson at jacquelinewilson.co.uk The Official Jacqueline Wilson Magazine is published by D C Thomson Reading Notes LITTLE DARLINGS By Jacqueline Wilson
Chapter One
“She feels so skinny, I’m scared of snapping her in half”.
In most children’s stories, the author gets rid of the parents early on; whether it’s Harry Potter or Enid Blyton, mums and dads generally aren’t around to interfere. In this story, though, the grown-ups are around, but it’s the children who are more in control than they are. Which arrangement do you prefer in a story?
“Steve started slapping Mum about”
Destiny and her mum have had it hard. No money, living on a rough estate, taking up with a violent stepdad. A question, then, for parents: do you think this is the sort of thing that should – or shouldn’t - be in a children’s book? Is it right that they find out about the kind of problems other kids have, or is it too early and too depressing for them to be introduced to such things?
Chapter Three
“It’s like Mum has shrunk down into being a little girl, and I’m the grown-up now, left looking after her” She really is a bit daft, isn’t she, Destiny’s mum? Thinking that selfish rock star Danny Kilman is going to be pleased to see her and his secret daughter? A question, this, for the children. then. Can you put yourself into Destiny’s shoes? Can you imagine what it would be like if the tables were turned, and it was you who were more grown-up than your parents? Or have you perhaps had that feeling in real life anyway?
Chapter Four
“Isn’t it lovely here?”
On the face of it, Sunset, Sweetie and Ace have got everything. They live with rich, famous parents in a great, big house with a guitar-shaped swimming pool, they go to a school where there are no rules, they get driven everywhere in chauffeur-driven cars, they’ve got a nanny to look after them round the clock, and they’re always having their photo taken for the glossy magazines. Would you like to be them? If not, why not?
Chapter Five
“Mum has to leave, or she’ll be late for her cleaning job.”
A lot of the time, Destiny’s Mum isn’t at home because she’s out working. So who do you think is the better mother – her or Sunset’s mum Suzy? And why?
Chapter Six
“They are a matching pair, smiling, smiling, smiling, speaking softly in turn – because they are being interviewed.”
Sunset’s parents Suzy and Danny are good at putting on a show of togetherness in public, especially when they’re giving an at-home interview for a showbusiness magazine. Can you imagine living in a house where it’s all about how things look, rather than how they really are? How would it make you feel?
Chapter Eight
“They seem to think they can do anything they want just because they’re so-called celebrities”
So says Claudia; underpaid, overworked, unappreciated nanny to Danny and Suzy’s children. She’s right: celebrities do think they can get away with things that “normal” people can’t. What might be the disadvantages, though?
Chapter Ten
“They’ll be the children of other artistes from Dad’s record label, or any other likely children that Rose-May finds at a model agency”
The guests at Sweetie’s birthday parties aren’t her friends at all! Would you agree to have a birthday party with no real friends, just to get into a glossy magazine?
Chapter Twelve
“When has your father ever done anything for you, Sunset?”
This is a horrible thing for Suzy to say to Sunset, especially as it’s so horribly true. Can you understand the reasons why Suzy is being so cruel?
“This could be huge”
So that’s the reason Danny agrees to welcome his long-lost daughter Destiny back into his life! Because it will be good publicity. It sounds all too likely, doesn’t it? Can you think of anything else that would have persuaded him to accept her?
Chapter Thirteen
How happy an ending?
What do you think about the way the story ends? Would you have liked it if selfish Danny and Suzy had agreed to change their ways, and be better parents? Or do you think that would have been too much like a fairy tale? If this were a film, and we were to see all the characters’ faces at the end, who do you think would be smiling most?
Did you enjoy this book?

Joanna Lumley launches appeal to save Peter Pan windows
Joanna Lumley, the actress, has today launched a campaign to save the childhood playground of JM Barrie, asking his loyal readers to sponsor the very windows which inspired Peter Pan.

Lumley, who is a patron of the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust, said the “marvellous” campaign would ensure the real birthplace of the children’s story remained standing.
She has now appealed to readers to help save the “sacred” piece of history and keep the “magical place alive” for the next generation.

Moat Brae, a Georgian townhouse outside Dumfries, Scotland, was saved by the Trust within three days of total demolition in 2009, after they managed to buy it from a housing association.
Trustees now hope to re-open it as a children’s literature and visitor centre, with an attic room recreating the children’s nursery exactly as in the story of Peter Pan.
The gardens, where Barrie played while spending five years at school nearby, are set to be reinstated as “Neverland”, with gardens and woods designed to allow children to “play and dream of being part of that magical tale”.
In order to complete the works, the Trust aims to raise £100,000 to complete renovations, and save the damp building from the elements.
They have now offered members of the public a chance to sponsor one of the 39 windows in the property, giving them the opportunity to “have their very own link with Neverland”.
Lumley, who will speak about the project at the Telegraph’s Wigtown Book Festival, said the windows were where JM Barrie dreamt up his most famous tale.
“There’s hardly anyone in the world who didn’t grow up with the world of Peter Pan,” said Lumley. “It’s one of the most famous of all the children’s stories ever written as well as the most enduring; it will never go out of fashion.”
“Windows are terribly important to the story. Peter Pan came in through the windows, and the children followed him out through the windows. It is there that Mrs Darling waited for them to return.
“There is something very special about windows as the link between this world and the magical one of Peter Pan.
“The idea that you can sponsor a window and have your very own link with Neverland is wonderful. At every level, you can contribute to keeping this magical place alive.”
The appeal is part of plans to ensure the house is wind and watertight, with sponsors offered the chance to have a plaque with their names engraved alongside their window.
Prices will range from £500 for a small stairwell skylight, to £20,000 for “Peter Pan’s Window”, situated in what will become the nursery.
Other include the “Starlight Dome” and the “Way to Neverland” window, which will open out into the gardens.
Cathy Agnew, project director for the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust, said: “We saved Moat Brae House just three days before the bulldozers were due to arrive. A lot of work has already been done but we urgently need £100,000 to restore the 39 windows, which will make the building wind and watertight – securing it for the next chapter in its future.
“Supporting the Windows Appeal is a wonderful way to have an enduring association with J M Barrie and his ‘enchanted land’. We plan to inspire future generations through our recreation of the Never Land, and celebrating great children’s stories.”
Adrian Turpin, director of Wigtown Book Festival, said: “J M Barrie's inspiration for Peter Pan is an exciting and universal slice of such heritage, and we hope the public responds generously to the restoration of Moat Brae House.”
Lumley will be appearing at the Wigtown Book Festival on Saturday, September 28, to speak about the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust, her life, and her career.

Best 20 trees for the garden
The best 20 trees for autumn colour, year-round interest, seasonal spectacular and show pieces for the front garden
Best trees: Amelanchier lamarckii (snowy mespilus) has something special each season, and birds love the fruit. By Tony Russell for BBC Gardeners' World Magazine
10:33AM GMT 30 Oct 2009
Comments
Five for autumn colour
You don’t need big trees to get big colour in autumn — these will really knock your socks off.
1 Acer palmatum ‘Osakazuki’ is the star among Japanese maples, for truly brilliant orange-red autumn colour.
2 Acer palmatum ‘Sango-kaku’ (aka ‘Senkaki’) is my favourite for really yellow foliage, but with an extra punch thanks to contrasting bright red twigs.

How to grow: sorbus, or mountain ash
23 Nov 2009
3 Amelanchier lamarckii (snowy mespilus) has something special each season, and birds love the fruit. It’s a tough, go anywhere tree.
4 Sorbus vilmorinii is a very neat, compact mountain ash with ferny foliage and berries that change colour the wrong way round — from red to pink and then white!
5 Pyrus calleryana ‘Chanticleer’ forms a narrow, upright column and is clad in wonderful pear blossom in spring, with good foliage that colours up well in autumn. At home I have eight of these planted as an ‘avenue’ next to my terrace — they’re fabulous!
Five for year round appeal
These small and medium-sized trees earn their keep with more than one season of interest.
1 Acer griseum offers great shape, superb autumn colour and shaggy, peeling, gingery bark that shows up best in winter.
2 Caragana arborescens (Siberian pea tree) is an unusual tree for a ‘difficult’ situation, as it withstands heat, cold and wind. It has a light canopy of ladder-like leaves and yellow pea flowers followed by pods. It’s also good in pots.
3 Cercis siliquastrum (Judas tree) produces pink pea-flowers that sprout straight from the branches and trunk, before the heart-shaped leaves appear. These are followed by red pods.
4 Myrtus communis (myrtle) is a multipurpose evergreen with small bay-like leaves, gingery bark and spiky white flowers in late summer, followed by black berries that birds adore. It has culinary uses, and takes kindly to trimming and shaping so is ideal for pots.
5 Aralia elata ‘Variegata’ (Japanese angelica tree) forms a large shrub or smallish multistemmed tree with beautiful variegated foliage and large heads of frothy off-white flowers in autumn. The spiky trunks show up well in winter.
5 for a seasonal spectacular
Enjoy beautiful emerging new foliage or unbeatable blossom or fruit on these small to medium-sized trees.
1 Embothrium coccineum (Chilean fire bush) can be trained as a small tree, its sparse canopy lighting up with orange-red ‘tongues’ of fiery flower in early summer. It prefers acid soil and should be sheltered from drying winds.
2 Eucryphia x nymansensis ‘Nymansay’ is a conical evergreen tree which produces masses of large, white, cup-shaped flowers with clusters of yellow stamens in the centre. It’s spectacularly glam during August and September.
3 Acer pseudoplatanus ‘Brilliantissimum’ is a small tree with a light canopy of shocking pink leaves in spring.
4 Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree) produces flowers and ripe fruits (from the previous year) all at once during late autumn, when it’s very welcome.
5 Paeonia suffruticosa (tree peony) is breathtakingly beautiful in full bloom, reaching nearly 2m tall. The various varieties offer massive chalice-shaped blooms in frothy pinks, oriental reds or pristine white in May or June.
5 for front gardens
These trees will stay compact, with a fine tracery of branches casting only light shade.
1 Betula albosinensis (Chinese red birch) is one of the ‘posher’ birches, with pink and cinnamon peeling bark.
2 Genista aetnensis (Mount Etna broom) makes a wide, weeping tree with bright green twigs instead of leaves. It needs little attention, then in July bursts into yellow bloom.
3 Sambucus racemosa ‘Plumosa Aurea’ is a flamboyantly shaggy golden elder. Naturally forming a large shrub, it’s best trained as a multi-stemmed tree or can be pollarded.
4 Magnolia x loebneri varieties make superb small trees. My favourite is ‘Leonard Messel’ because of its abundant pale pink flowers in mid-spring.
5 Gleditsia triacanthos (honey locust) offers light, ferny foliage. The coloured-leaved varieties, such as golden ‘Sunburst’ or mahogany-red ‘Ruby Lace’, are small and slow growing and will do well in pots.
Trees and neighbours Make sure trees don’t lead to disputes with your neighbours: Don’t plant a tree close to neighbours’ buildings on soils prone to subsidence. Consider the eventual height and spread. Is the tree likely in time to overhang your neighbour’s property or restrict their light? There are legal positions on both of these issues, and these also apply to neighbouring trees that overhang your own property.
If you want to remove branches that overhang your garden from next door, first ask your neighbour if they are willing to cut them back. If they refuse — and the tree is not protected by a tree preservation order (TPO) — you are legally entitled to prune within the following criteria. You must only cut on your side of the boundary; you must not trespass on your neighbour’s property; you must offer the prunings to your neighbour; if your neighbour doesn’t want them, you must dispose of them in a responsible way (you mustn’t leave them in your neighbour’s garden without permission). If the tree is protected by a TPO, or is within a Conservation Area you must apply to your local authority for permission to prune. To find out if a tree is has a TPO, contact your local authority.
There is very little legal protection related to the loss of light caused by single trees or deciduous trees. What there is only applies to the windows of a property and not to the garden. However, when it comes to high evergreen hedges, local authorities do have powers in certain circumstances to instruct a hedge owner to reduce the height or face a fine of up to £1,000.
When is a tree not a tree?
When it’s a shrub. Some large shrubs look great trained to look like a small formal tree on a single stem, or you can leave several stems branching from ground level, like a multi-stemmed tree.
When it’s pollarded or coppiced. Pollarding (cutting all the branches back close to the trunk) or coppicing (cutting them near ground level) every few years restricts the size and gives a new shape.
When it’s topiary. Trees such as yew can be clipped into compact, ornamental shapes — balls, cones or whatever takes your fancy.
When it’s a wall shrub. You can grow quite tender trees flat against a warm, sheltered wall. They’ll look great and take up little space.

Woman dragged by truck carrying dead bodies
A truck carrying the bodies of the victims of a massacre in Mexico has crushed a woman when it crashed into two cars and pushed them down a street. 1:36PM BST 02 Sep 2010
The truck, transporting 72 frozen corpses of migrants to a morgue, crashed and crushed 20-year-old Elba Gonzalezas between two cars, which were then dragged down a street.
Gonzalez is in a serious condition in hospital, suffering from a hemorrhage in one of her legs.
The bodies which the truck was carrying were found at a remote ranch near the US border and are believed to be victims of Mexico's increasingly bloody drug war.

Abu Dhabi to build £400 million Louvre Abu Dhabi has awarded a $653 million (£406 million) contract to build a branch of France's Louvre museum, signalling the oil-rich emirate is again moving ahead with flamboyant development projects. The Louvre in Paris and other French museums are to lend works to the new museum Photo: AFP/Getty Images	8:40AM GMT 08 Jan 2013
Arabtec Holdings, a big construction firm headquartered in neighbouring Dubai, said on Tuesday it had been awarded the contract by the Abu Dhabi government. Construction is due to finish in 2015.
Abu Dhabi, the capital and second largest city of the UAE, plans to build three museums near its downtown area as part of a drive to develop itself as a top tourism destination and diversify its economy beyond oil. The other two museums are a branch of the Guggenheim of the United States, and the Zayed National Museum.
These projects and a number of others were postponed as Abu Dhabi reviewed its economic condition last year in the wake of the crisis. A property market crash in the emirate has slashed real estate prices by over 50 per cent in the past several years.
But because of large fiscal reserves built up through its oil exports, Abu Dhabi has ridden out the crisis comfortably. Following the review, big development projects are proceeding once again, though at a more conservative pace.
The plan for the Abu Dhabi Louvre calls for "a complex of pavilions, plazas, alleyways and canals, evoking the image of a city floating on the sea". Hovering over the complex will be a 590-foot dome inspired by traditional Arabic architecture.

The museum will contain archaeological artefacts and works of art from a wide range of periods and cultures. During its first 10 years, the Louvre in Paris and other French museums are to lend works to the museum, with loans diminishing as Abu Dhabi builds up its own collection.
Originally, all three of the Abu Dhabi museums were to be built between 2013 and 2014. The Guggenheim is now slated for 2017 and the Zayed National Museum for 2016.

Danny Care: I learnt my lesson and want my England place back
Harlequins scrum-half has grown up since his fall from grace and is determined to reclaim Test spot for autumn series

Audition time is coming to a climax, final casting is upon us, the curtain is set to rise. Jostling thoughts in the minds of the England selectors as they approach the autumn Test series will have to become definitive decisions over the next three weeks as the opening match against Australia at Twickenham on Nov 2 rushes into view. There is still scope for a late push into contention, still high-octane matches – think Saracens-Toulouse at Wembley or Top 14 champions Castres at home to Northampton with Ospreys to test the Saints eight days later – for fringe candidates to make their play, games of an intensity that will match what is headed England's way in a month’s time. There is only one area of the field, at prop, that you could regard as nailed on. Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole, the favoured duo, face each other in the East Midlands derby on Saturday. Even then the credentials of Mako Vunipola, and Joe Marler behind him, should not be discarded. Everywhere else places are up for grabs. Of course, there are back-stories that need hefty consideration. Those who might rush to dispense with Chris Robshaw on the openside take no account of the regard in which Stuart Lancaster holds him for services rendered these past two years. But change there will be. Every other position has new talent clamouring for attention: from Marland Yarde on the wing, through to Joel Tomkins, Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph in the centre to Billy Vunipola in the middle of the back row. All pushing, all chomping, all looking to make a vivid impression in the weeks ahead. Related Articles

Such talk is familiar to Danny Care. The Harlequins scrum-half has lived with it ever since Leicester’s Ben Youngs came on to the scene three years ago. As in the era of Matt Dawson, Kyran Bracken and Andy Gomarsall, the No9 shirt has flitted from one to the other. That is not all. You might also add Saracens’ Richard Wigglesworth to the mix as well as the Dickson brothers, Lee at Northampton and Care’s Harlequins’ team-mate, Karl. England are stockpiling talent, finally achieving strength in depth. Care is doing all he can to ensure he runs out against the Wallabies. He has been in a ding-dong battle with Youngs for the shirt. The Leicester scrum-half holds the whip hand as a Lions tourist while Care was rested from England’s tour of Argentina. “I really wanted to go, especially after the disappointment of missing out on the Lions,” Care said. “But the time off has been a real boon. I feel I’ve come back firing and just looking to do what I can for Harlequins and force myself into the reckoning for England.”
Youngs is seen as the more technical all-round scrum-half while the England management has told Care to work on his decision-making. However, he does have pace, that most precious asset. He put it to good effect last Friday against Worcester when streaking clear for a try. “It is all very well seeing a gap, it is quite another thing to be able to take advantage of it,” said Conor O’Shea, Harlequins’ director of rugby. “What Danny brings is special, an X-factor that can turn a game. Too many people focus on the occasional blemish and fail to realise just what dynamism he can bring to a side. “He does manage a game. A scrum-half has to make so many decisions. Every time the ball comes back from the forwards he has to make a call whether to pass, kick, run, pop it up, fire it out. England are blessed with the pool of scrum-halves they have at the moment. There is real quality there. “Danny has got a hell of a lot to offer. He has come back from the summer refreshed, is settled and has a smile on his face. He now looks really ready for the next phase through to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the most exciting time in prospect for any English player.”
Care intends to take full advantage. He has managed to tread the line between bringing more order to his game while allowing his natural instincts to flourish. “You cannot allow yourself to get inhibited, to worry unduly about making the right decision, you have got to play what is in front of you and back yourself,” said Care. “That is the way it is here at Harlequins. The coaches trust us. You have just got to do your stuff. If it comes off, great. If it doesn’t, you go again.”
Care has lived by that creed. He has been redemption in action over the past 18 months, picking himself up after a self-induced fall from grace when banned from England’s Six Nations squad 18 months ago for drink-related incidents. A potential opponent, Australia’s wild boy, James O’Connor, would do well to follow his example. The Wallabies’ patience with their talented utility back ran out on Thursday when he was banished from their line-up indefinitely after police escorted him from Perth Airport after an alcohol-related row, the latest of several such episodes. The 23-year-old is highly-regarded as a player and would have expected to start against England at Twickenham. Instead he was missing from the Wallaby squad on tour in South Africa and Argentina, and will not be offered another contract with the Australian Rugby Union. Care knows exactly what he is going through. He was dismissed from Stuart Lancaster’s first Six Nations squad in January 2012 yet has returned as a better, more rounded player as well as a more settled individual. “It did me the power of good even though I felt the world was against me at the time,” Care said. “Being banned from your national side is the hardest way to learn a lesson. “And perhaps the best way because it really makes an impact. I didn’t necessarily agree with it 100 per cent yet it brought it home to me when I switched on the television and there were my mates running out in the white shirts and red rose to represent their country. That really hurt. It was a horrible time, yet I had brought it on myself. I had to learn from it. And I did.”
Lancaster, who knew Care better than any other player in the squad having coached him as a teenager, would have preferred not to have been obliged to make an example of him but it certainly brought home to everyone involved in English rugby that a radical shift in behavioural standards was under way. Australia faces the same problem that Lancaster did after the tarnished 2011 World Cup campaign. O’Connor is only one of several Wallabies with disciplinary issues. “It took me time to realise that I was a role model to a lot of people and that if I wasn’t behaving off the field, then I didn’t deserve to be on it in the first place,” Care said. “People make mistakes, especially when young. James is a brilliant player. I’m sure he will learn and be back playing for Australia.”
It did the trick for Care. He intends to make sure that he does not miss out on a Twickenham experience next month. England
