Will Martin McGuinness be a guest at the Queen's Irish reception?
There is talk that the Queen will invite Martin McGuinness to the reception she is holding on March 25 for the 'Irish community'.

The Queen delights in her “all walks of life” lunches. Whether she will take such an approach to the reception she is holding on March 25 for the “Irish community,” ahead of the first state visit of Ireland’s president, Michael D Higgins, remains to be seen. Martin McGuinness, whose accomplices murdered Lord Mountbatten, the Queen’s cousin, shared a historic handshake with her when she visited Belfast in 2012. So is the Stormont Deputy First Minister on the guest list? Neither Buckingham Palace, nor McGuinness, will tell me. Least said “I know far too many fathers who have to grovel to their ex-wives for the odd evening or weekend with their children,” Ben Goldsmith observed on a social networking site. Did this mark the recommencement of public hostilities between him and his former wife Kate Rothschild, with whom he traded barbs after her affair with the rapper Jay Electronica. Related Articles

Christmas exodus gets off to disastrous start with rail delays
The great festive getaway got off to a disastrous start after a fire caused major disruption to London's Paddington station, the main gateway to the west and Heathrow Airport. By David Millward and Richard Alleyne
8:11AM GMT 21 Dec 2012
Vast numbers of Britons are taking a two-week festive break this Christmas, with the exodus already well under way, according to transport experts. But the fire in an equipment room at Acton station in west London has led to many services being cancelled to Paddington station, forcing travellers to find alternative routes on one of the busiest days of the year. According to Network Rail, the fire meant only two of the four lines were open on Friday morning. Network Rail said the fire damage was so extensive it has had to rebuild the equipment room from the ground up but it hopes to have all lines back open "some time this morning". No trains were running between Paddington and Heathrow Airport, putting extra pressure on the Tube network where there were delays on the Jubilee Line following a signal failure. Related Articles

The service, which runs every 15 minutes, carries 16,000 passengers a day. Some reports said the delays could last until 3pm. The major failure could not have come at a worse time. Heathrow Airport said it was expecting 123,000 passengers to depart and 104,000 to arrive. On the railways, flooding near Ellesmere Port on Merseyside meant buses had to replace trains between Ellesmere Port and Hooton. Buses also had to be laid on between Bridge of Orchy and Crainlarich in central Scotland due to a landslip. No trains were able to run between Crewe and Chester in Cheshire due to flooding, while floods were also the cause of the bus replacement that had to operate between Uttoxeter and Stoke-on-Trent. The flooding also led to disruptions to services in the Derby and Nottingham areas as well as hold-ups between Chester and Wrexham General in north Wales. A person being hit by a train at Levenshulme in Greater Manchester meant long delays to services between Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly, with some other services in the area having to be altered. In the West Midlands, a signalling problem near old Hill caused delays between Smethwick Galton Bridge and Stourbridge. Numerous roads were flooded. Among towns where motorists had to contend with floods were Reading, Bedford, Nottingham, Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire and Egginton in Derbyshire. Heathrow was handling 123,000 passengers today, with a further 114,000 departures on Sunday and 88,000 on Christmas Eve. British Airways was also having its busiest day of the holiday period today, with 111,000 travellers getting away for the Christmas break. BA will handle nearly 31,000 passengers on Christmas Day, with the airline carrying nearly 1.6 million in the period up to January 7. Many of the estimated four million Britons travelling abroad for the holiday set off today. Travel organisation Abta said a number of Britons were taking advantage of bumper snow levels at ski resorts, while travellers seeking winter sun were choosing such destinations as the Canary Islands, Tunisia, Cuba and Mexico. From today until January 3, a total of 700,000 will be leaving from Gatwick airport, 320,000 from Manchester, 300,000 from Stansted, 125,000 from Luton, 116,000 from Birmingham and 75,000 from Glasgow. In addition over the period from tomorrow to the end of Christmas Eve, 52,000 will fly from Edinburgh airport and 56,000 from Bristol. Popular overseas spots for new year revellers include Paris, Reykjavik, Rome, Dublin and New York. Many hundreds of thousands will also travel across the English Channel by ferry or through the Channel Tunnel, with 160,000 heading off on high-speed trains run by Eurostar. On the roads, the Highways Agency, which is responsible for all of England's motorway and major A-roads, said more than 250 miles of roadworks will have been completed before Christmas. In addition, a further 57 miles of works will be suspended between today and January 2. But works remain in place at 19 locations covering nearly 100 miles. These include the M4 between junctions 10 and 11 at Reading in Berkshire, the M25 at junctions 5 and 6 near Godstone in Surrey, and the M5 between junctions 19 and 21 near Bristol. The AA said the busiest days on the roads were expected to be today and tomorrow, with 60 per cent of AA members likely to take to the roads over the festive period. Northern Ireland drivers were most likely to get behind the wheel over Christmas, with the Welsh least likely to. The busiest roads this weekend are likely to be the M25, the M6 in the West Midlands, the M1 near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, the M5 near Bristol and the M62 near Warrington in Cheshire. VisitEngland said that over the festive period as many as 12 million Britons intend to take at least one trip in the UK involving an overnight stay. These trips are likely to generate around £2.1 billion for the economy. Of those taking trips involving overnight stays, 35% said they are going to be away for longer than last Christmas. Two main line rail strikes that threatened travel chaos over the Christmas period have been called off. But on the Underground, the train drivers' union Aslef is stopping work on Boxing Day in a strike that has already led to the postponement of the London football derby between Arsenal and West Ham United. Apart from the Aslef Tube strike, the main train problem is likely to be engineering work on the West Coast line. This will mean there will be no direct services from Euston station in London to Milton Keynes, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool or Glasgow on December 23 and 24. Hourly services will run from Euston via an alternative route (Chilterns) to Nuneaton where passengers will be able to change for services heading to any and all the destinations mentioned above. Direct services resume on December 27 but with two of the four lines closed up to and including New Year's Eve. There is engineering work affecting a number of other lines, although Network Rail and the Association of Train Operating Companies have said that the number of replacement buses having to be laid on has almost halved compared with the 2011/12 festive period.

WikiLeaks: Britain secretly advised Libya how to secure release of Lockerbie bomber
Ministers secretly advised Muammar Gaddafi’s Libyan regime how to secure the successful early release of the Lockerbie bomber, documents obtained by The Daily Telegraph have disclosed.

A Foreign Office minister sent Libyan officials detailed legal advice on how to use Abdelbaset al-Megrahi’s cancer diagnosis to ensure he was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds. The Duke of York is also said to have played a behind-the-scenes role in encouraging the terrorist’s release. The Libyans closely followed the advice which led to the controversial release of Megrahi – who was convicted of the murder of 270 passengers on Pan Am Flight 103 – within months of the Foreign Office’s secret intervention. The disclosure seriously undermines British Government claims that is was not complicit in the release of al-Megrahi, and that the decision to free the convicted terrorist was taken by the Scottish Executive alone. It will also lead to renewed pressure from senior American politicians on David Cameron to release all internal documents detailing Britain’s role in the scandal. Last summer, the Prime Minister pledged to release the relevant information – but the publication has yet to occur sparking fears that a cover-up may have been ordered. Related Articles

Lockerbie bomber: timeline of key dates
20 Aug 2010
The Daily Telegraph today publishes more than 480 American documents detailing international relations with the Libyan regime over the past three years. The documents – obtained by the WikiLeaks website and passed to this newspaper – provide the first comprehensive picture of the often desperate steps taken by western Governments to court the Libyan regime in the competition for valuable trade and oil contracts. Any perceived political slight on the part of the Libyans often leads to western companies losing lucrative contracts with Gaddafi’s erratic behaviour a major problem in maintaining good relations. Last year, the British Ambassador is recorded as telling his American counterparts in Tripoli that he had to negotiate with the Libyans “on their terms” and should “not be frightened by the name Gaddafi”. The documents disclose in detail how British ministers and officials were desperate not to allow Libyan anger over the ongoing imprisonment of Megrahi to derail the growing commercial relationship between the two countries. Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer, was imprisoned in 2001 for life after being found guilty of bombing Pan-Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. For several years, the Libyans pressed for the terrorist to be returned to the north African country under a prisoner transfer agreement that was being negotiated. According to American officials, Tony Blair was suspected of securing trade deals after agreeing to include Megrahi in the agreement. However, Megrahi was imprisoned in Scotland – where the offence occurred – and any decision on his release was for the Scottish authorities although Westminster drew up the relevant legislation. In October 2008 – as negotiations on the prisoner transfer agreement were ongoing – Megrahi was diagnosed as suffering from cancer. It can now be disclosed that within a week of the diagnosis, Bill Rammell, a junior Foreign Office minister, had written to his Libyan counterpart advising him on how this could be used as the grounds of securing al-Megrahi’s compassionate release from prison. Rob Dixon, a senior Foreign Office official, met with the American Ambassador to brief him on the letter. An official American memo on the meeting states: “FCO Minister for the Middle East Bill Rammell sent Libyan Deputy FM Abdulati al-Obeidi a letter, which was cleared both by HMG and by the Scottish Executive, on October 17 outlining the procedure for obtaining compassionate release. “It cites Section 3 of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act of 1993 as the basis for release of prisoners, on license, on compassionate grounds. Although the Scottish Crown informed the families of the Pan Am 103 victims in an email October 21 that the time frame for compassionate release is normally three months from time of death, Dixon stressed to us that the three month time frame is not codified in the law.” Mr Dixon went on to disclose to the Americans that Jack Straw, the then Justice Secretary, had also spoken to Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister about the case which had led Government officials to believe that the terrorist would be released. The minute of the meeting with the Americans records: “Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond told Jack Straw that he will make the final decision in this case. Salmond told Straw that he would make the decision based on humanitarian grounds, not foreign policy grounds; Dixon told us HMG has interpreted this to mean that Salmond is inclined to grant the request.” Following the meeting, the American Ambassador reported back to his superiors in Washington said that the release of al-Megrahi could “occur sooner rather than later” and that Whitehall officials were handling sensitive negotiations with the Libyans on the issue. Later documents also disclose that the Qatari government, one of the richest in the world, also became involved in the effort to secure al-Megrahi’s release. The Americans thought that the Qataris may have offered financial incentives to the Scottish Government. The Libyans are also recorded to have offered a “parade of treats” to the Scottish government. A senior Qatari minister visited Scotland to discuss the case. The documents reveal a meeting between the American Ambassador in Doha and the Qatari government. “At an October 28 meeting with MFA Minister of State for International Cooperation Khalid Al-Attiyah, Ambassador raised strong USG concerns about Qatar’s role in the release of convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbasit Al-Magrahi,” the record of the meeting states. “ Al-Attiyah said that Qatar became involved because Qatar, as 2009 President of the Arab League, had been asked by the Arab League to do so. “Ambassador pressed the issue of whether Qatar had offered any financial or trade incentives to induce Al-Megrahi’s release. Al-Attiyah strongly dismissed such speculation, saying 'That is ridiculous; It was not necessary to offer money. It was all done within Scottish law. We offered no money, investment, or payment of any kind’.” After Megrahi was released in August 2009, another American document records Gaddafi’s comments – which suggest that Prince Andrew, the UK’s trade envoy, may have played a role. The document records: “He [Gaddafi] went on to thank his 'friend Brown’, the British Prime Minister, his government, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Andrew, who 'against all odds encouraged this brave decision’. [Gaddafi] noted that the UK efforts would positively affect 'exchange’ between the two countries. When al-Megrahi was finally released, it also emerged that Gordon Brown instructed the British ambassador to hand deliver a note to Gaddafi. The letter was ostensibly to ask the Libyan leader not to lionise the released terrorist but the delivery of the letter also presented British officials with the opportunity for a rare private meeting with Gaddafi. The leader usually only sees very senior foreign politicians and dignitaries. The disclosure of the secret Foreign Office advice to the Libyans is set to spark renewed calls for the British government to appear before the US Senate to justify its role in the bomber’s release. In September 2009, it emerged that Mr Rammell had told the Libyans that neither the Foreign Secretary or the Prime Minister wanted to see al-Megrahi die in prison. However, government ministers strenuously denied that they had become involved in the release. David Miliband, the then Foreign Secretary, said that there had been “no double dealing”. Wikileaks
