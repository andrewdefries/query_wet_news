Follow A female serial killer has pleaded guilty to murdering three men before dumping their bodies in ditches. Joanna Dennehy stabbed her landlord Kevin Lee, 48, and housemates Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, and John Chapman, 56, within days of each other. The body of Mr Lee, who was a married father, was found stabbed to death in a roadside ditch in March. Four days later, a farmer found the corpses of the two other men in a remote dyke five miles away. A post mortem found Mr Slaboszewski, who was unemployed, had been stabbed in the heart. Dennehy, 30, from Peterborough, appeared in the dock in a white shirt with a star tattooed under her right eye. She stood alongside her boyfriend Gary Richards, who is 7ft 3in tall, and also known as Gary Stretch. Related Articles

He denied three charges of preventing burial and the two attempted murders. Dennehy had been due to stand trial charged with the three murders and preventing the lawful burial of the victims. But she told the court on Monday: "I have pleaded guilty and that's it." Her shock guilty pleas left the oak-panelled courtroom stunned. Her barrister, Nigel Lickley QC, said: "The course of the arraignment is not one we had anticipated." Dennehy also pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to the attempted murders of another two men, Robin Bereza and John Rogers. She objected to her lawyers being given more time to check her guilty pleas and said: "I'm not coming back down here again just to say the same stuff. "It's a long way to come to say the same thing I have just said.' At the time of the murders neighbours claimed Dennehy had been involved in a row over the rented property she was living in. Mr Slaboszewski and Mr Chapman, who was also unemployed, were said to have lived with Dennehy in a shared house in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough owned by property developer Mr Lee. Friends said Mr Lee had been trying to evict Mr Slaboszewski, Mr Chapman and Dennehy in the weeks before the killings. Toni Roberts, 25, who used to live in the house, said the tenants had been served an eviction notice by Mr Lee ordering them out by April 25 so the house could be renovated. "Kevin was my landlord and really kind to me and didn't make me pay a deposit or anything," she said. "I can't say a bad word about him really. "I moved out and then Joanna moved into my room. I don't know if she paid rent or anything though." The bodies of all three men were found between March and April. Mr. Lee died from stab wounds to his chest, while Mr Chapman was knifed in the neck and chest. At the time of his Mr Lee’s death, his family described his death as a “tragic loss” They said in a statement: “He was a wonderful husband, father, loving brother and son. His naturally infectious personality touched everyone who knew him.' His friend Chris Wilson, a plasterer, said: 'We have no idea why he would be targeted or what has happened.” Two other defendants appeared at the hearing by videolink. Leslie Layton, 47, and Robert Moore, 55, have previously denied helping to cover up the killings and harbouring Stretch and Dennehy when they were wanted by police. Moore, of Peterborough, denies two counts of assisting an offender, while Layton, of Bifield, Orton Goldhay, pleaded not guilty to perverting the court of justice at an earlier hearing. Crime

Barack Obama's view on Iran 'completely different' from Israel's Iran has claimed that the Obama administration has "completely different" views on the Islamic Republic to Israel and the US Republican Party, according to an intelligence ministry report.

The report, posted on the ministry's newly launched website vaja.ir, claimed that the Democrats had "pinned their" hopes on a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear threat, and that there was "open confrontation between President Barack Obama and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue. It was apparently prepared before Mr Obama's re-election victory on Tuesday over Mitt Romney. "The Republican party has a more severe confrontational approach towards Iran ... and its proposed policies are close to those of the Zionist (Israel) regime," it said according to an AFP report. Mr Obama's "Democratic party's position is completely different" on Iran, it added. Related Articles

The analysis contradicts the rhetoric of Iranian leaders and media who daily denounced Mr Obama during his first term, accusing him of aligning his policies to those of Israel in a bid to weaken the Islamic republic. "Although Democrats have not hesitated in implementing hostile policies against the Iranian nation and repeatedly say that 'all options are on the table,' they have pinned their hope on diplomacy," the report said. Mr Obama has rallied US allies against Iran, toughening sanctions, with Tehran's oil exports and access to world financial systems being key targets. The United States and other world powers, including Tehran's arch-enemy Israel, accuse Iran of using its nuclear programme to mask a drive for atomic weapons. Tehran denies that, saying it is for purely peaceful purposes. Although Mr Netanyahu has exerted "immense pressure" on Mr Obama to adopt a firmer stance on Iran, the report said, "the policies of the Obama administration are different from those of the Zionist regime". The analysis also argues that the Obama administration has a more moderate approach on sanctions against Tehran than European countries. "Although Americans have themselves imposed expansive sanctions against Iran, they are still trailing the Europeans in this regard," it said. Iran has also signalled it may be open to hold dialogue with the "Great Satan," its epithet for the United States, following the re-election of Mr Obama. Meanwhile, Iranian warplanes fired multiple rounds at an unmanned unarmed US surveillance aircraft in international airspace over the Gulf last week, but the craft was undamaged and returned safely to its base, Pentagon spokesman George Little said on Thursday. President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta were both advised early on about the unprecedented incident on Nov 1. Iran was later warned through diplomatic channels the US would keep conducting surveillance flights in the region and would protect its military assets, Mr Little said. Iran
