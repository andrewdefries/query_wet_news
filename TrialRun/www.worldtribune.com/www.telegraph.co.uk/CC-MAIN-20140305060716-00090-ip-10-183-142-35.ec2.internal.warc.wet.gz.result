Scandal of doctors paid more to do less
Senior hospital doctors have received pay rises of up to 28 per cent following the introduction of a “nonsensical” contract that allows them to refuse to work in the evenings and at weekends, a report warns.
Taxpayers are now faced with an annual bill of almost £6 billion for the most qualified doctors, who are typically receiving six-figure salaries, despite growing concerns over the quality of care being offered at many hospitals outside of normal hours Photo: ALAMY	By Robert Winnett, Political Editor

Comments
An investigation by the public accounts committee concludes that the productivity of consultants “continued to decline” over the past decade as new terms and conditions for those working for the NHS were introduced.
The inquiry found that 60 per cent of consultants were qualifying for special bonuses that are supposed to be restricted to those doctors demonstrating exceptional performance.
Taxpayers are now faced with an annual bill of almost £6 billion for the most qualified doctors, who are typically receiving six-figure salaries, despite growing concerns over the quality of care being offered at many hospitals outside of normal hours.
A report last year found that patients admitted to hospital at the weekend were 40 per cent more likely to die than those treated during the week.
Some NHS trusts are having to make additional payments of up to £200 an hour to doctors who agree to work at weekends. In the report, the committee of MPs concludes that the hospital consultants’ contract offers “poor value for money”.

Health ministers today said the deal offered to consultants by the last government had been “absurdly naive” and needed to be renegotiated.
Many of the problems uncovered by the MPs mirror those identified in an analysis of the GP contract, which also offered generous pay rises while scaling back out-of-hours care.
Tonight, Margaret Hodge, the chairman of the PAC, said: “A new contract which increased consultants’ pay by between 24 per cent and 28 per cent failed to halt a continuing decline in productivity. Many of the improvements envisaged by the Department [of Health] were achieved but that’s because its objectives were absurdly unambitious. The contract allows consultants to refuse to work during evenings and weekends. As a result, hospitals struggle to provide the appropriate level of consultant-led care for patients. Some trusts even pay up to £200 an hour for additional work which is done at weekends.”
The report also highlights the failure of the NHS to link doctors’ pay to performance. It criticises the release of tables that are supposed to allow patients to compare surgeons and identify whom they wish to treat them. Although a “good idea in principle”, the MPs say that the figures being published “remain poor and are not transparent”.
Clinical Excellence Awards, costing £500 million a year and intended to reward performance that is over and above that which is normally expected, are also singled out for criticism, as they have actually been paid to about 60 per cent of consultants.
“This nonsense highlights how badly consultants’ performance is being managed,” Mrs Hodge said. “A proper culture of performance management for consultants and other NHS staff must be implemented if we are to avoid incidents of poor performance.”
The committee said improved monitoring was “essential” to avoid another care scandal after hundreds of suspicious deaths at Stafford Hospital. It recommends that a new contract be introduced that demands seven-day working and caps payments for additional hours. A more sophisticated system that offers doctors higher pay to work in certain areas and specialities suffering from shortages should also be considered. Tonight, Dr Dan Poulter, a doctor and health minister, said that reform of the contract was necessary. “This is yet another example of the Labour government being absurdly naive when negotiating contracts with the medical profession,” he said. “Medical contracts need to reward doctors fairly … but must also provide a service which benefits patients, and change in this area is long overdue. That’s why we have begun discussions on making changes to the consultant contract and clinical excellence awards.” The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, accused the committee of using “barbed rhetoric” and said the criticism of performance awards was unfair. Dr Paul Flynn, the chairman of the BMA’s consultants committee, said: “The public accounts committee report tries to use productivity statistics as a justification to attack the terms and conditions of hard-working doctors. “But these statistics take little account of the quality of patient care or of changing working patterns elsewhere in the hospital … the perversity of using these statistics to measure the value of consultants is that we are judged to be less productive if we spend more time with our patients.” He said that the BMA was in exploratory talks with NHS employers about many of the issues discussed in the report, but added: “The barbed rhetoric from the public accounts committee describing the system for awarding excellence as 'nonsense’ is particularly unhelpful at a time when we are trying to come up with some broad principles for potential negotiations.”
Consultants account for 4 per cent of NHS staff but their pay amounts to 13 per cent of all NHS employment costs. The 40,000 consultants working in the health service were paid £5.6 billion in 2011-12 — an average of £140,000 each — according to the committee’s report. Mr Hunt and Sir David Nicholson, the outgoing head of the NHS, will today appear before MPs and are expected to be questioned over plans for improving the standard of care in hospitals.

Latest SWANSEA 0 LIVERPOOL 0
15.22 Disappointing scoreline in the end, but it was the archetypal entertaining goalless draw. Both keepers in great form, and some sparkling moments from standout attacking players Hernandez and Suarez. Sterling was busy but error-prone, Gerrard is beginning to look Actually Past It and Swansea could do with a better lone striker than Ki or Shechter. Thanks for your company, I'll talk to you again soon. FULL TIME
90+3 min No immediate benefit from the corner, but Shelvey frightens Tremmel with a menacing shot which he has to parry away. 90+2 min Corner to Liverpool. 90+1 min We're going to have four added minutes. 89 min Swansea applying the pressure as we drift towards full time. 87 min Great effort from a free kick by Hernandez. Reina gets his fingertips to it and it's another Swansea corner. Williams on the end of it once more, but heads over. 85 min De Guzman off for Swansey, Kemy Agustien is on. 83 min Huge chance for Liverpool after Rangel completely misjudges Reina's punch and it ends up totally passing him by. This puts Suarez and Sterling into a two on one againse Davies. They trade passes, but Sterling's return ball is overhit horribly and the chance has gone. Suarez still finds space for a dig, but Tremmel gets behind it and holds on. That should have been a goal. 81 min Sterling, still looking fresh, never hiding, does well to get to the byline and deliver a cross. Overhit, and Dyer briefly looks to have fashioned a chance by knocking it over Enrique, but it's out for a throw. 77 min Double sub for Liverpool. Shelvey on for Henderson, Joe Cole replaces Downing. 75 min Reina and Dyer both up and seemingly okay. Michael Laudrup here from the category of managers apparently celebrating goals in games without goals: 73 min Excellent from Reina, who races off his line to close down Dyer after Downing's miskick opened up a run at goal. Reina and Dyer both hurt in the process, Reina seems to have come off wiorst. 72 min Flores is all over Suarez as he's turned just inside the Swansea half. Gerrard floats in the free kick, but Agger's header is easy enough for Tremmel. 70 min Dyer shoots from the edge of the box after a Swansea corner. Deflects behind for another. Williams the target again, but he heads over this time. 68 min Nathan Dyer on for Wayne Routledge for Swansea. 67 min Routledge goes down in the box after an apparent tug from Agger. The incident happened outside the box, but nothing was given, in any case. 64 min Williams rises highest from the corner and heads towards goal and Allen clears from off the line! 63 min Swansea enjoying a better spell now. Routledge finds Angel with a marvellous reverse pass. Good control from the Spaniard, and his shot deflects behind for a corner. 60 min Liverpool certainly having the best of this half so far. Suarez forces a good save from Tremmel, who's then played into trouble by his own defender and forced into a frightening clearance. But clear it he does. 56 min Gerrard with shot from what would have been exciting range in 2006. As it is it's never threatening the keeper, and well over the bar. Time for a pertinent statistical tweet from our friends at Opta: Twitter: OptaJoe - 97% - Joe Allen completed 35 of his 36 passes for Liverpool in the first half vs Swansea. Prodigal.
53 min Hernandez has a pop from the free kick. Up and over the wall, but also up and over the crossbar. 52 min Hernandez is fouled not far from the "D" by Allen, after turning too quickly for the former Swansea man. Free kick, good position. 49 min Not really clicking for either side so far. Johnson steps up to cut out a too-obvious pass to the wing, the dribbles forward 40 yards with a noticeable lack of options ahead of him. He's dispossessed. 46 min Swansea get us re-started. They've replaced Shechter with Ki at the break. 14.16 One of the best halves of football I've seen in the Premier League this season. As little as Liverpool fans would want to admit it, these are two fairly evenly-matched teams, and the way they're going about their business is extremely easy on the eye. Sterling and Johnson looking strong and threatening for Liverpool, Swansea thriving whenever Hernandez is on the ball. See you in 15. HALF TIME
45+1 min We're into the sole minute of time added on. 44 min Rotten pass from Gerrard as Liverpool are camped in Swansea's half. Woefully wide of Johnson, who'd found space on the right. I don't think it's too controversial to say that Stevie G may have peaked as a player. 42 min Suarez wins a corner after trading passes with Sterling. Liverpool beginning to shade it as half time draws close. Johnson heads it over from the corner. 38 min More of the same from the excellent Hernandez, who is running Liverpool ragged today. Wonderful control, then a nutmeg to get past Johnson before another curling shot from 25 yards. Over this time. Not by much. 34 min Enrique has a goal ruled out, he'd strayed minutely offside just before stabbing in Suarez's pass. Probably just about the right decision, but still feels somewhat harsh. Marc Melander has a question about the referee I presume the whistler is not THE Jon Moss?
I presume you mean THIS Jon Moss? If so, I can confirm that today's oficial is not the former Culture Club drummer. Disappointing. 33 min Sterling hits the bar! Wonderful shot in the aftermath of the corner. Rattles the woodwork. 32 min Nice inteplay betweetn Sterling and Johnson, with the full back spotting Sterlings outside-in run and playing the correct ball through the gap. Sterling crosses well, and Tremmel palms it way, extremely dangerously, to Suarez. His attempt is well blocked, Liverpool corner. 30 min Reina's playing a risky game today. Third time so far he's been very close to being dispossessed in his own box. Gerrard loses it for Liverpool and Swansea pour forward. De Guzman, with two open options to his left, has a shot. Silly boy, it's wide. 28 min Sumptious curling effort from Hernandez from just outside the box after some excellent close control eked out the chance. Just wide. 27 min This is a thoroughly enjoyable game to watch. Both sides very pretty on the ball, and they're both attacking with vigour. Suarez tries to go it alone with four Swansea defenders in front of him and the goal. His shot is blocked. 24 min Johnson plays an excellent one-two with Enrique and finds himself in a one-on-one against Tremmel in the Swansea goal. Well saved! 23 min Swansea still on top, but Liverpool are doing a good job of containing them. Their rigid two banks of four are limiting Swansea to aimless balls over the middle at the moment. 21 min Brendan Rodgers has been frantically writing notes all game so far. Whadda man: 20 min End to end at the moment, with Swansea having the better of it. 19 min Great Swansea move. Intricate, clever but gutsy too, with Hernandez winning the ball with a surprisingly snappy tackle before clipping it into the box. Shechter wants to get on the end of it but Reina, bravely, gets there first. 17 min Enrique with Liverpool's best chance of the game so far. Johnson swings in an excellent pass from a fairly deep position on the right. Enrique's able to get onto the end of it but his finish betrays his defence-based pass. He opts to connect with his chest. Never wise. Wide. 15 min Sterling shoots from just outside the box. Tame, and easy for Tremmel. Should have done better. Serious business from Twitter's Football Cliches: Twitter: Football ClichÃ©s - Jonathan de Guzman is eligible to play international football for Holland, Canada, Jamaica and the Philippines. Dilemma.
13 min Quasi-chances for Michu and Williams from the corner, but both are snuffed out. 12 min Routledge with the best shot of the game so far, running with purpose into the box from the right and striking it hard and low towards Reina's left-hand post. Reina saves smartle, but concedes a corner. 11 min Davies v Sterling is turning into an enjoyable battle. The Swansea full back tries to get onto a chipped ball out towards the left flank. Sterling tracks him all the way, perhaps indulges in a spot of shirt-tugging, then buys a goal kick off Davies. Some mild handbags afterwards too. Bonus. 9 min Good spell of possession for Liverpool, but there's an element of toothlessness about them, with Allen and Henderson having attempted defence-splitting passes cleared with ease. Sterling beats Davies out wide and delivers a cross but it's headed away. 7 min More good work from Hernandez down the right. Certainly fancy him up against Downing and Enrique today. He's also got Pablo H on his back, which is a charmingly Primary School move. 5 min Of course it wasn't a cross from the corner. How naive am I? It's Swansea, so it's a short pass, which comes to nothing despite Liverpool being visibly surprised that it's not been smacked into the area. 4 min Swansea corner, after Hernandez sneaks in behind Downing. Good recovery tackle from Downing to prevent the cross. Now we will have a cross. From a corner. 1 min Here we go then, Liverpool begin the game with a kick off fit for a country named Wales. 13.27 Luis Suarez and Ashley Williams shake hands. And even smile at each other. My word, football growing up? Who knows, Chelsea might get through their match later this afternoon without upsetting anyone. Stranger things have happened... 13.25 The match ball arrives in unusual fashion, a couple of members of our armed services assailing down from the roof with one of their number with it tucked in a rucksack. We're good to go then once we have the teams, who are coming out in a more conventional walking out of the tunnel formation. 13.20 Well done Swansea fans. Brendan Rodgers, who helped mould their team in to one famed for passing and possession football, gets a decent reception from the Liberty Stadium. Now let's see how they greet Luis Suarez the first time he hits the turf... Twitter: dangerhere.com - Ray Wilkins: "This could be a record game for possession stats, as both teams like to keep the ball." 70% each maybe? #lfc #swansea
13.01 Things now take a turn for the marginally surreal, courtesy of emailer Ghalib Hussein: The turkey I saw on thanksgiving was beautiful, but I guess she didn't get the warmest of receptions.
12.48 Here are the teams: Swansea: Tremmel, Rangel, Williams (c), Chico, Davies, Britton, de Guzman, Routledge, Hernandez, Michu, Shechter.
Subs: Cornell, Monk, Tiendalli, Agustien, Ki, Dyer, Lita. Liverpool: Reina, Johnson, Agger, Skrtel, Enrique, Allen, Gerrard (c), Henderson, Downing, Sterling, Suarez. Subs: Jones, Carragher, Coates, Suso, Shelvey, Cole, Sahin. Referee: Jon Moss 12.30 Afternoon liveblog fans. We could spend this introduction talking about two teams with similar styles facing off, the exciting prospect of Leon Britton passing the ball 300 times or Raheem Sterling's hair. But let's face it, this afternoon is all about Brendan Rodgers and his return to South Wales. How will he be received? You'd hope with a modicum of politeness, given what he did for Swansea. Politeness is an ever-decreasing commodity in The Modern Football, though, and if Swansea's supporters have watched any of Being:Liverpool they'll have extra reasons to dislike their former manager. Seems like a nailed on home win, amirite? Disagree? Send polite emails to the address above. Team news and more bobbins to follow, stay tuned. I suppose that you better have a lovely preview, then: Sunday, November 25 Swansea City v Liverpool
Liberty Stadium
Kick-off: 13.30 GMT
TV: Live Sky Sports 1, Highlights BBC ONE Match of the Day2. Swansea (Possible, 4-3-3): Tremmel; Rangel, Chico, Williams, Davies; De Guzman, Britton, Hernandez; Ki, Michu, Dyer.
Out: Lita (thigh), Situ (Achilles), Taylor (ankle), Vorm (groin). Tests: Graham, Davies and Moore (illness). Liverpool (Possible, 4-3-3): Reina; Johnson, Agger, Skrtel, Wisdom; Allen, Gerrard, Suso; Enrique, Sterling, Suárez.
Out: Borini (foot), Kelly (knee), Lucas (match fitness).
Test: Wisdom (knee). Referee: Jon Moss. Matches 6, R1 Y22. Team News
Swansea manager Michael Laudrup has Ki Sung-yueng and Kyle Bartley back in his squad. Ki missed the win at Newcastle with a hamstring problem, while defender Bartley returns after a lengthy absence with a thigh problem. Goalkeeper Michel Vorm is a couple of weeks away from full fitness after a groin injury while Danny Graham, Ben Davies and Luke Moore are struggling with illness but should be available. Defender Andre Wisdom is expected to be fit for after sustaining a knee injury in the Europa League on Thursday night. The 19 year-old was taken off in the first half as a precaution but manager Brendan Rodgers, who will restore the likes of Steven Gerrard and Luis Suárez to the starting line-up, is confident the right-back will be ready in time. Meanwhile, midfielder Lucas Leiva returned to competitive action on Friday after three months out with a thigh injury after playing 45 minutes for the under-21s but is probably a week away from rejoining first-team squad. Match Notes
The return of former manager Brendan Rodgers dominates this intriguing Sunday contest. Rodgers left the Liberty Stadium for Anfied in the summer and will be keen to win this particular game if only to address their modest league form. Swansea, who were 2 1 winners at Newcastle last week, will need to find a way of preventing Joe Allen dominating the midfield much as he did for the Swans last season. Betting: Home 21-10, Away 23-20, Draw 12-5. Stat of the game: Swansea manager Michael Laudrup has 16 points, three more than Brendan Rodgers had in his first 12 games at Swansea last season. Graham Clutton’s prediction: Swansea City 2 Liverpool 1. Premier League

Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook's first lady
Before Sheryl Sandberg joined Facebook or Google, she was chief of staff to US Secretary of the Treasury, Larry Summers. That she started out in politics comes as little surprise.

The 43-year old who, as Facebook’s chief operating officer, ranks as one of the most influential women in business, is masterful at charming her crowd whilst giving very little away.
Yesterday, on a rare visit to the social network’s headquarters in Britain, all coiffed hair and stylish outfit, she rattled off stats and polished sound bites with barely an um or an er.
Facebook is “the most engaging platform this planet has ever seen”, she claimed. Its new “Home” product, which allows people to turn the fronts of their mobiles in into a Facebook newsfeed, is “as important if not more important than television”.
In America, one out of every four minutes spent on smartphones is spent on Facebook. Did she mention that 63pc of users in Europe check into Facebook at least once a day?
Next came a dose of flattery. Facebook chose London as the site of its first engineering centre outside America “to take advantage of what is a very strong pool of technical candidates”. Europe is “really important to Facebook. We are growing and expanding and investing”.

She doesn’t get here more than once a year, a member of her entourage explains, but that’s because she doesn’t like being away from her children.
Ms Sandberg will spend part of her visit to Britain promoting her new book, Lean In, which advises women to wilfully ignore the glass ceiling, and to refuse to modify their ambitions in order to accommodate family plans. The book has sparked controversy, with critics claiming that it is all very well to take that view when you have more than $400m in Facebook stock and a pay package of more than $30m a year. Ms Sandberg said yesterday she was “surprised by how many people paid attention” but was grateful for debate “because I don’t know of anything that changes without heated debate on both sides”.
Many have interpreted Lean In as a political tract designed to ease her route back into the sphere where she began her career. But Ms Sandberg said yesterday that she had no such plans. “I’m not [leaving]. I love my job. I wrote this book because, along with my job, I’m watching what’s happening – or not happening”.
Facebook’s investors would be rattled by a Sandberg departure. Alongside founder, Mark Zuckerberg, Ms Sandberg is the main face of the company. The possibility of her departure is listed in the “risk factors” section of its Securities Exchange Commission filings.
However, shareholders might also be concerned that Ms Sandberg is spending so much energy campaigning for seismic social change, less than a year on from Facebook’s disastrous flotation. Shares in the company were trading at $26.59 in New York yesterday afternoon, well below its $38-a-share initial public offering.
One of the biggest issues the company has faced is the rapid increase in mobile users, which has outpaced the advances Facebook has made in monetising them through advertising.
“To say that mobile is important to Facebook is the biggest under exaggeration of all time,” Ms Sandberg said yesterday. “We now have a computers in our pockets that are 100 times more powerful than the computer that sent the first man to the moon in the year I was born.”
Facebook’s attempts to harness that shift have been controversial, but Ms Sandberg said the company would not back away from its strategy of serving up ads based on detailed user information.
Facebook Home goes a step further, by turning the fronts of users’ smartphones into a Facebook “feed”, featuring ads and updates from friends. It is available on devices that run on Google’s Android operating system, but not Apple’s iPhones and iPads.
Ms Sandberg came the closest yet to declaring a Facebook alliance with Google, and distancing the company from Apple.
“Home is based on the openness of Android,” she said. “Apple controls its interfaces...Just look at Android phones - there is a huge range of them. The iPhone always looks like the iPhone.
“We are going to going to continue to develop for both [but] it is true that Android allows us to develop a far more immersive Facebook experience.”
She refused to disclose how Facebook’s discussions with Apple went, insisting blandly that they have a “very good relationship”. But in the world of technology giants, it feels like the ghost of a new battle line has been drawn - just with deft, political diplomacy. Facebook
