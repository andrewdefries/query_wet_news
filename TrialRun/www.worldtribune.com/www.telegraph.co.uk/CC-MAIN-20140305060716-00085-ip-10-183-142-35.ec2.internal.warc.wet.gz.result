Seduced by Art: Photography Past and Present, at National Gallery – Seven magazine review
Photography comes off a distinct second-best when compared to Old Master paintings at the National Gallery 2
The Destroyed Room by Jeff Wall, in the Seduced by Art exhibition at the National Gallery
Photo: Jeff Wall	By Andrew Graham-Dixon
2:18PM GMT 08 Nov 2012
Comments
For the first time in more than 150 years, the National Gallery has put on an exhibition devoted to photography. The result intrigues, beguiles and disappoints in roughly equal measure. It opens with an enigmatic selection of photographs inspired by Eugene Delacroix’s inflamed depiction of rape, murder and solipsistic obsession, The Death of Sardanapalus (1827) – itself meagrely represented by a small copy in oils, lent by the Louvre. Beside this ghost of the original hang Jeff Wall’s light-boxed Cibachrome, Destroyed Room (1978), which reconceives Delacroix’s mayhem as the aftermath of a teenager’s self-destructive rampage through their own bedroom; Tom Hunter’s Death of Coltelli (2009), in which a half-naked girl in a Hackney bedsit adopts the pose of one of Sardanapalus’s doomed consorts; and Sarah Jones’s The Drawing Studio (2008), the image of a dirty mattress draped with a purple sheet in a paint-spattered room. From the off, photographers are cast as parasites feeding on the meatily substantial body of Old Master painting – a little mystifying, given that the strident rhetoric of the exhibition frames photographs as works of art in their own right.

Cotman in Normandy, at Dulwich Picture Gallery, Seven magazine review
02 Nov 2012
The rest is grouped according to the genres of old-fashioned artistic theory. There is a room of portraits, containing some extremely ordinary photographic portraits, as well as one or two genuinely arresting pictures – notably, Craigie Horsfeld’s hypnotisingly intense, large-scale picture of a man with a beard, Hernando Gomez, Calle Serrano, Madrid (2006), a homage to Velazquez printed on rough-toothed watercolour paper that gives the inks a subtlety of tone not often encountered in photographs. There’s a room devoted to the human figure, in which Richard Learoyd’s Man with Octopus Tattoo II (2011) stands out: the transfixing image of a man caught in the coils of his own tattoo, grabbing behind his back at the inky octopus which itself grabs forever at his frail flesh. Then there are rooms of still life, landscape, and “Tableaux”, (shorthand for history painting). Sam Taylor Wood’s time-lapse film of rotting fruit looks trite by comparison with the mute wonder of oranges and lemons painted by Goya’s contemporary, Luis Melendez. None of the assembled landscape photographs begin to compete with the tiny monochrome explosion of a storm at sea painted by the Norwegian Romantic Peder Balke. Only Luc Delahaye can be said to have made a photographic contribution to history painting: his panorama of US Bombing on Taliban Positions, of 2001, shows nothing much, a stretch of wasteland over which the ghostly smoke of recent explosions still hovers; but it has a brooding quality that at least gives pause for thought. The truth is that very few photographers have ever produced images with the weight of thought and feeling found in the greatest paintings. The camera is certainly an artistic tool, and photos can certainly be works of art. But can they be works of art of the same order as paintings? Modern critical orthodoxy would say yes. But the real answer is no. Photography lacks the depth and heft, the thinking sense of touch, that painting possesses. That is why the greatest images of the last 150 years– the images people argue about, contest, return to again and again – are not photographs but paintings: Turner’s Rain, Steam and Speed, Picasso’s Guernica, Pollock’s Autumn Rhythm, Bacon’s Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. The camera can do lots of things, but not those things. To Jan 20, www.nationalgallery.org.uk

Wimbledon plan second roof on Court No 1
Plans for a second roof at Wimbledon have emerged, with Court No 1 benefiting from continued redevelopment by the All England Club.
Doubling up: Wimbledon chiefs are planning a second roof at SW19 Photo: PA	By Telegraph Sport

Follow Comments
The All England Club showed off their closed roof for the first time in 2009 after a five-year plan and around £100 million spent in technology and labour. According to the Daily Mail, the development could be unveiled next month, with construction going ahead after this summer's Championships. It is understood that a second retractable roof at Wimbledon would also be more cost-efficient than the Centre Court offering. As part of SW19's plans - entitled 'Wimbledon 2020' - further redevelopment includes alterations to the Royal Box, while the practice facilities and the club's indoor court complex will also be uprgraded. The news of a second roof is signficant given that it means television would be able to cover two matches at the same time, regardless of the weather. Related Articles

The Centre Court's roof was put into immediate action during its first Championships in 2009 when the head groundsman took the decision to close it overnight. Court No 1 currently holds 11,500 spectators and a second roof would match the Australian Open, though Melbourne is currently building a third. Wimbledon

Every country without a flight: trip gets Guinness record
Graham Hughes’s trip to every country in the world without flying has been recognised by Guinness World Records, more than a year after he completed the journey The route Graham Hughes took to achieve his record By Soo Kim

The British traveller's epic trip visiting the world's 201 countries in four years and 31 days has been officially accepted as “the fastest time to visit all countries by public surface transport” by Guinness World Records. The five-month long verification process, which normally takes about eight weeks, was prolonged due to the vast amount of data that needed evaluating before confirming the record. The documentation of Mr Hughes’s travels included 193 pages of passport stamps, more than 10,000 photographs and more than a million individual GPS data points as well as 400 hours of video footage. Last July, Mr Hughes put together a compilation video tracing his epic 'Odyssey Expedition', taking viewers around the world in four minutes and one second. This late acceptance of his feat follows Guinness World Records’ previous refusal to ratify his journey as a record achievement. In January 2013, Mr Hughes was forced to retrace a part of his journey in order for it to be recognised as a record. Although he had previously crossed into Russia from Estonia in spring 2009, he went over the border illegally, making it the only country he did not enter officially. Mr Hughes then paid £100 for a return coach ticket to Gdansk, from where he travelled with a €75 visa to Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave bordering Poland and Lithuania. “I can’t remember a more absorbing record to verify in recent years,” said Marco Frigatti, senior vice president of the records management team at Guinness World Records. "It took a lot of effort and time to authenticate. Graham’s achievement is astonishing and it’s a pleasure to recognise his new Guinness World Records title."

The proud Liverpudlian globetrotter described the recognition as "the icing on the cake" and something he had strived for "since day one of my adventure back in January 2009.”
Mr Hughes's journey began on a ferry from Buenos Aires to Colonia in Uruguay and ended in 2012 in South Sudan. He travelled alone on a shoe-string budget and with no professional support such as a camera crew. His main reason for undertaking the challenge was to "prove it was possible" and that "with a fistful of dollars and the right amount of tenacity, grit and patience you can – if you really want to – go anywhere", as he recently wrote in Telegraph Travel.
