Nairobi Storymoja Hay Festival: Defiance in the face of loss
Alice Vincent was at the Hay Festival Nairobi when terror struck. She hears the writers who refused to be silenced.
Storymoja Hay Festival: Professor Kofi Awoonor (inset), one of the guest speakers, died after sustaining injuries during the attack at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi By Alice Vincent
12:38PM BST 30 Sep 2013

Half way through the Storymoja Hay Festival I stopped concentrating. Two miles away, in the only part of Nairobi I had become familiar with during my short stay, militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab had opened fire on innocent people in the Westgate Mall. Helicopters flew overhead, and although normality prevailed around the festival tents, I felt a little sick, a little scared, a little short of breath. The speculated casualty numbers passed through Twitter to word of mouth around the National Museum of Kenya, the leafy, rambling location for the festival. By lunchtime 12 had died, shortly after it was 20. A cloak of confusion hung over us, as it did over the whole of Nairobi. The events were alien, but also horribly familiar; emerging from my memory as headlines from earlier terrorist attacks in London or New York. Heavy clouds drew in with the evening and the site emptied as emergency security was brought in. A handful of brave, stubborn speakers gave the talks they were in Nairobi to give, regardless of what their embassies told them. Notably, the African poets from Sierra Leone, Kenya, Uganda and Ghana, who went to perform without Ghanaian poet and diplomat Kofi Awoonor. The 78-year-old could not be reached. People said that he had gone to Westgate with his son earlier in the day. The one lesson I learned from it all, a heady, heart-wrenching mix, was to tell stories. During the festival’s opening Dr Auma Obama, activist and sister of the US President, stressed that “people need to write. Kenyans have wonderful stories to tell, we must share ourselves, share our stories.” Four days later, we reeled sleepless from the events that had passed and Kenyan storyteller Atinuke told me that I must write, and write beautifully, about my experience. Stories were a cradle of comfort in those 24 uncertain hours. The strength and efficiency of the festival’s organisers ensured that I rarely felt unsafe, shuttled from safe place to safe bed in the company of others. Our driver, Moses, navigated a path along Nairobi’s dusty and unlit roads, deftly avoiding the roadblocks and closures in the city. Unable to sleep, we sat up with tea and gin, depending on the time, and shared anecdotes against the insects’ calls in the forest nearby. Related Articles

A few hours later we learned that Awoonor had died after sustaining injuries from the shooting. It was dizzying news that made the walls within which we were safely confined seem smaller. Storymoja is a friendly festival, and while I had not met Awoonor, we had shared the same spaces over the previous days. After arriving at the festival, I listened as he praised the diversity of African writers on the bill: “together we are discussing the birthing pains of countries.” None of us realised then how painfully prescient this statement would become. For this type of mourning, silence was not an option. Four days earlier, Storymoja founder Muthoni Garland had introduced the festival as “an unadulterated, unapologetic celebration of writing”. She showed the same strength by hosting an evening of reading and remembrance for Awoonor on the festival site on Monday, the siege still ongoing a short drive away. More than 150 people came, read, lit candles, a glimmer of hope that something good could come out of the atrocities that had so recently occurred. Although he had lost one of his country’s shining lights, the Ghanaian High Commissioner was undeterred. “Next year,” he told Garland, “I will bring you more writers from my country. That is what Kofi Awoonor would have wanted.” Other authors, Atinuke, Teju Cole and Jenny Valentine, insisted they wanted to return to the line-up next year, when Dr Obama will be Festival Director, to tell their stories in defiance of fear and loss.

Email Thom Gibbs with the answer to this question: What or who is Newcastle's greatest export? Latest 21.55 I've been standing by my belief that United would win the league this season, but after that I'm not so sure. The oddest thing about that game was how little they offered. Newcastle weren't fortunate to win by that scoreline. You could argue that it flattered them, but they simply looked better than United, who offered so little in response that they looked like a mid-table side. Extremely worrying times for them, especially given that Rooney and Ferdinand, supposedly key players missed in their defeat to Blackburn, were present. Losing twice on the bounce to the likes of Newcastle and Blackburn is not what champions are made of. Newcastle looked back to their early-season best and played well all over the pitch. Their long balls weren't dealt with by the United defence, and the entire side worked tirelessly with and without the ball. I like the look of full-back Santon, who looks better every game. Several excellent dribbles from him this evening. The loss of Tiote and Ba to the African Nations is a genuine shame. For the record, in answer to the question above, I'm saying Viz. Over and out from me, thanks for your company. FULL TIME
90+2 min Four minutes of added time will be played. Alex Ferguson and Phil Jones silently summon large hole which will swallow them both. 90 min GOAL!!! Newcastle 3 Man Utd 0 (Jones OG)
Wow. Seemingly aimless punt into the box from Krul from a free kick deep in his own half. Lindegaard comes for it, Jones hasn't realised and heads it awkwardly after it bounces in the box. Lindegaard is stranded and the ball heads straight for the vacant net. Laughable. Come back David, all is forgiven? 89 min Demba Ba comes off to a suitably heroic reception from the Newcastle fans. It's Obertan on against his former club. 87 min Anderson gives it away cheaply. Best collects the ball and is fouled cynically by Carrick in the centre circle. Newcastle look home and hosed here. 86 min Coloccini criminally misjudges a l;ong hoof through the middle by Carrick which lets Welbeck in. He miscontrols, but it might fall for Hernandez... No, Krul's alert, off his line, and smothers it. 85 min Severe bout of The Gloom in this email from Peter Littley: 5 or so mins to go and MUFC heads are down. Ferguson has more problems than he realises. This team is old, weak across the back, leaky in goal and toothless upfront. Spurs really do have a chance. 83 min United corner worked shot. Headed out of danger. Carrick wins another corner from the other side. Played short again. Nothing comes from this one. Newcastle get it clear and have a throw in their own half. 81 min Tiote tumbles over Carrick as the United midfielder looks to break from the centre circle. He's booked. United do nothing with the free kick. This is not looking promising for Fergurson's side. 79 min Krul comes off his line to punch a Nani cross from the right clear as Hernandez loiters with intent beyond the penalty spot. Good keeping. Krul's been pretty much impeccable tonight, but hasn't had much to do. 78 min James Perch is coming on for Cabaye. Eeeek! The game's fallen flat, which will suit Newcastle just fine, cheers. 75 min While Leon Best comes on for Ameobi for Newcastle. 74 min Wayne Rooney is coming off to large-scale delight from the St James' Park crowd. It's Anderson replacing him. 70 min Mancthedaddy has blamed predictice text for his confusing use of the word "depth". "Swap was the intended word," he says. It all makes more sense now. 69 min Krul takes a free kick from just inside Newcastle's half aiming for Ameobi, but Evra gets the better of him on this occasion. 66 min Hernandez on for United at last. It's Park coming off. 64 min Newdastle still trying to attack here which is both brave and sensible. Taylor wins a free kick on the touchline. Tiote is down and receiving treatment. I expect Alan Pardew will be hoping that's a serious enough injury to keep him out of the African Nations Cup. 63 min The dubiously named Mancthedaddy is concerned: I've been worrying about Fergie's dubious tactics of late, and once again he disappoints me. Manchester's problems are a lightweight midfield, who have provided the top 2 nothing. Fergie's answer..... To swap forwards??? Marvellous... Just a different forward to be isolated. Park and Giggs off, Anderson and Rafael on, depth Nani and Valencia. Not sure what he means by "depth" there, but it all sounds fairly logical other than that. 62 min Ohmygoodnessagoalkeeperhasscored!!!! Sadly it's not in this game. Tim Howard has done it at Goodison Park against Wigan, a wind-assisted clearance, apparently. Brilliant scenes. 61 min Some more contributions for Newcastle's greatest export: Ant & Dec. You didn't specify if it was football related so this is the best I can offer says Rachel Davis. Ant and Dec, no contest! says Sally, while Simon Coombs offers some vaiety: I still think any of Newcastle’s exports are outclassed by Bristol City sending (Andy) Cole to Newcastle.
59 min So close for Rooney! It's cleared off the line by Simpson after an untidy tussle in the middle. Welbeck collects near the byline and attempts to square it but it's too far in front of Park sliding in at the far post. 57 min Welbeck coming on for United, who, in fairness, I overlooked on the subs bench. He is decent. Berbatov is the man coming off. 55 min Williamson free in the middle! Lindegaard nowhere near it! The centre back heads over. 54 min Newcastle corner. Taylor looks for Williamson, but can only head it towards the other corner. He runs to collect his own ball and Newcastle keep possession. Taylor tries a dink from deep and Valencia is forced to concede another corner. 53 min Valencia crosses from the left looking for Rooney on the far post. It's over his head. Newcastle need to weather the storm for 15 minutes here. 52 min Ferguson has his armed crossed, miserably, on the bench. Really hard to see how his side are going to get back into this. Who's going to do much (aside from Chicarito) on his bench of De Gea, Anderson, Hernandez, Welbeck, Rafael Da Silva, Pogba and Lingard? 50 min ...and a lovely stat about direct free kicks from Opta Joe: Seven of the 13 direct free kick goals in the PL this season have been scored by Newcastle (3) & Sunderland (4). Regional.
49 min Here's Peter Lilley once again: Hard to see what SAF can do in terms of subs. to change things up. Nothing on the bench looks to be the spark to counter the play of Tiote. Giggs will run out of steam soon, probably get a yellow and have to be taken out. is the wind behind MU this half ? No, they're attacking into it. Worrying times for United. 47 min GOAL!!! Newcastle 2 Man Utd 0 (Cabaye)
Oh my, what a free kick!Three steps, struck beautifully, curling and swirling in the wind and that's perfectly placed into the top corner. Lindegaard got a finger to it, but could only deflect it ono the bar and in. It bounced out again, but was clearly over the line. 47 min Jones illegally jostles Ba off the ball as he runs diagonally from a central position about 35 yards from goal. He's booked. Newcastle free kick. 46 min An email about kick-offs from Victor Ireland: Sometimes a teams approach (strategy/confidence) to a match (opponent) can be "read' from the way the kick-off is executed; or conversely how the opposition i.e. "defending" team counters i.e. lines up.
I can tell you that United kicked off, worked it short, and Newcastle had bodies around the ball almost immediately, forcing United to play it backwards. What does it all mean? 20.48 Superb half from Newcastle who are looking hungry, and full of pace and desire so far. It's not really clicked for United other than a spell of dominance at the very beginning of the game. Too much is going through Giggs in the middle of a flat four in midfield, and as good as he remains he's not really got the ability to boss games at this level any more, especially not when he's being so thoroughly hounded by Tiote and Cabaye. Rooney's not been in the game enough and Berbatov has barely contributed at all. They need a re-think. If Newcastle can keep up this level of performance it's going to take something special to break them down. See you in 15. HALF TIME
45+2 min Ba with a decent shot from very long range at the end of a really assured passing move by Newcastle, working it forward from a position of pressure on the back four to a chance, largely thanks to a purposeful diagonal run by Santon. 45+1 min Two minutes of added time this half. 44 min Decent effort from the free kick, but it dips just over the crossbar. Think Lindegaard had it covered even if it hadn't. 42 min Ba shrugs off Giggs in the middle and Giggs tries a Scholesesque lunge to win the ball back which has me instinctively waving an imaginary yellow card at the screen. What have I become? Newcastle have a free kick about 30 yards from goal, fairly centrally. Taylor's going to take it. Not the one with the rubbish suit. 41 min Nani looks close getting into the box at the end of a dribble on the right. Tiote is on hand to provide a crucial tackle, and neat backheel to Coloccini to keep the ball away from United. Tiote's having a blinder tonight, he's everywhere. 39 min Peter Lilley on the new sponsor picture below: Must be a good logo, Evra can't wait to rip it off. 37 min The ball is blown out of the quadrant by the still-fierce wind. It eventually settles down for Giggs to take the set play, but Newcastle get it clear. 36 min United looking shaken here, they've faded badly after a swashbuckling start. But Taylor gives the ball away on the right, giving the away side a chance to break. Nani plays in Giggs on the left, whose cross is turned behind for a corner. 33 min GOAL!!! Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0 (Ba)
Ah, that's some goal, and much deserved from Newcastle who have grown in confidence markedly as this half has progressed. Total route one. Krul puts a gigantic kick on Ameobi's head, who flicks on above Jones to cause Ferdinand and Ba to chase it into the box. Ba sticks out his right foot and half-volleys it in beautifully beyond Lindegaard, perfectly positioned into the exposed far side of the goal. 31 min Jones goes on "one of those runs" which seem increasingly ineffectual to me. He bursts foward at the end of a one-two but is pretty easily dealt with by Tiote in the middle. 30 min Good spell for Newcastle, with St James' Park roaring following that denied penalty and a series of tenacious tackles to win the ball back from United every time they're in possession. It's brought to an end by a poor cross from Taylor from the right which goes behind for a goal kick. 29 min James Harrington on the continuing saga of Steve Taylor's suit: Regarding Steve Tailors dress code, it appears to be some sort of G suit, and his bulls appear to be fighting to get out...
27 min Pfff, Ray Wilkins is convinced by that penalty shout, but it just looked like an innocent tangle of legs to me. 25 min Howard Webb waves away what looks a credible penalty shout after Ba gets away from Ferdinand and looks to be dragged down. Here are Newcastle United's newly-sponsored shirts. Note how you can see the outline of their former sponsor underneath the new ironed-on patch. 22 min Rooney's put through by Giggs! He's played onside by Coloccini after Williamson moved up, the ball's straight through the two centre backs. Rooney stumbles over the ball, and the chance is gone. That's pretty poor for the man with the expensive hair. 21 min A decent Rooney free kick is struck low and powerfully from 30 yards. It deflects off the wall for a corner. Aimed at Berbatov, with Jones attacking the ball just behind him, but it evades them both and Newcastle have a throw on the other side after Valencia failed to keep it in. 18 min Taylor's corner is beaten down unconvincingly by Lindegaard, but United clear their lines to avoid any further danger. (I'm obviously going for a "Newcastle" = Newcastle United "United" = Manchester United approach this evening) 15 min Lovely move fom United, with Rooney the architect, turning and releasing Nani on the right who puts a wonderful cross on Berbatov's head, just shy of the far post and 10 yards from goal. His header takes a deflection off Tiote and hits the bottom of the post. Goal kick, says Howard Webb, incorrectly. 14 min Peter Littley on Taylor's clobber: Looks like he's ready for a Bull Fight. Someone on Twitter has already asked: "Is Taylor going to a wedding after the match?"
12 min Nani stings Krul's palms with an aggresively-struck curler from just inside the box. The keeper puts his punch straight at Rooney, but he fails to control it on his knee and Krul can catch the rebound. 11 min Here's his look for this evening: 10 min Gervase King on tonight's pressing question: what on earth was Steven Taylor wearing in the Sky studio before kick-off? I am not a waistcoat wearer myself so not up on such matters, but is it usual to tuck one's tie into one's waistcoat? I am sure that Steven Taylor is better versed than me so I shouldn't question it.
8 min Tiote with a decent shot from range from at least 30 yards. Lindegaard is down quickly to block it. Solid start from the seemingly-un-error-prone custodian, who's also claimed a couple of other shots and crosses with confidence so far. 7 min Ben Howard on Newcastle's greatest export: Byker Grove, surely?
4 min Great chance for Ba! Simpson's cross evades everyone and it falls to Ba at the penalty spot, but is bobbling somewhat and seems to deveive the striker, who stumbles and falls rather than leathering it past Lingegaard. Big miss. 3 min Crucial tackles for Newcastle. Gutierrez tracks Berbatov into the left-hand corner before dispossessing him. United win the ball back, Park beats Coloccini too easily and looks set to take it into the box, but Tiote is on hand with a slide tackle. 2 min United in promising positions already. Giggs almost slides a through ball into Rooney but Coloccini gets in the way. Park has a decebt cross from the left cleared for a throw. 1 min Swirling wind at the Sports Direct Arena of Sadness as the game kicks off. Newcastle have one point from nine here since the ground was renamed. 19.57 The teams are out. The animated angry gold Premier League lion does a roar to signal some adverts. We are mere minutes away from a football match taking place. 19.55 The person operating the St James' Park wheels of steel is playing the Ramones as a pre-match appetiser. Great shout. I will recreate the atmosphere by posting the song below: 19.52 Steven Taylor, on punditry duty for Sky, has also just said that Ba was suffering in his early days at the club because he was "doing the Ramadan," making religious fasting sound like a hip new dance trend. 19.50 Extraordinary interview with Demba Ba on Sky at the moment, in which Geoff Shreeves asks the striker to tell him a secret about himself. Ba channels the spirit of an eight year old, Shreeves a kindly uncle: Demba Ba: "I love syrup."
[Pinteresque pause]
Geoff Shreeves: "Syrup?"
DB: "Yeah, you know what it is?"
GS: "Yes. Why?"
DB: "I just love it. Like, strawberry syrup. It just is..."
GS: "How often do you have it?"
DB: "Every day. If I have water, I put syrup in it."
GS: "Is that good for you?"
DB: "Don't know."
19.45 While MC "Jeff" Kenna has a witty retort: Best thing out of Newcastle? The A1.
19.39 David Nemeth has a query: Even though I'm from the States, I've been following English football for 20 some years. One question that has been bothering me is: Why is Newcastle considered a "big club"? Since it is obviously not because they win trophies, what could it be? Oh, that tiresome "trophies" argument... Excepting about six of the 92 league clubs the idea of "winning trophies" is a distant dream for almost every football supporter these days. Newcastle have a bloody big ground which they more or less fill for every home game. They take huge away support everywhere they go. If you were one of the 0.006 per cent of the population good enough to play football professionally but not one of the 4.5 per cent of those good enough to play for one of those six clubs you'd jump at the chance to play for Newcastle. (Yes, I've done the sums. Probably badly). 19.34 Alex Ferguson has totally merked Sky pundit Dwight Yorke about his suit choice for this evening. "That's an old suit, that is," he said. OOOOOOH!!! Yorke has responded with smiles and jokes. That's not how you do it, Dwight! You should have had a go at his club tie or something. 19.28 Here are the teams in full: Newcastle: Krul, Simpson, Coloccini, Williamson, Santon, Ryan Taylor, Tiote, Cabaye, Gutierrez, Shola Ameobi, Ba. Subs: Harper, Ben Arfa, Perch, Best, Obertan, Sammy Ameobi, Vuckic. Man Utd: Lindegaard, Valencia, Ferdinand, Jones, Evra, Park, Carrick, Giggs, Nani, Berbatov, Rooney. Subs: De Gea, Anderson, Hernandez, Welbeck, Rafael Da Silva, Pogba, Lingard. Referee: Howard Webb (S Yorkshire) 19.21 David De Gea is dropped for Manchester United after his Blackburn howler, replaced by Anders Lingegaard. Wayne Rooney returns for the visitors. 19.17 While Steven Hartley corrects me: It's Newky broon. Newcy rhymes with sissy, nearly.
19.10 Here's Karl from Exeter chiming in with his favourite Geordie things: Newcastle brown, Paul gascoigne and the large and much vaunted naturist on the terraces at the second St James park.
19.07 Some very exciting news from St James' Park. Newcastle have signed a new sponsorship deal with Virgin Money, who have acquired former sponsors Northern Rock. All the excitement of a (slightly) new shirt midway through a season! 18.47 Is anyone approaching football burnout after the festive period? This is about the last of the insanity isn't it? Just the small matter of the third round of the Cup this weekend to contend with. I'm all for ludicrously busy turns-of-year. Unless it produces stinkers like West Brom v Everton on New Year's Day. 18.30 Evening liveblog fans. Ah, Newcastle. Home to Viz, Newcy Brown and Newcastle United and their short-lived position as Genuine Top Four Challengers for about 20 minutes at the beginning of this season. It's 2012 now, and in this bleakest of years (for the Mayans, and presumably those in charge of organising the Olympics) things look altogether less rosy for Alan Pardew's squadron. They were comfortably seen off by a not-that-great Liverpool side in the Christmas / New Year hinterland, and recently only have a win at Bolton on Boxing Day to remember fondly in a godawful run of only two wins in their last nine games. They face that Manchester United, who looked pretty godawful themselves in the weekend o'upsets just gone, losing 3-2 at home to Blackburn and with only Nani looking anything like a creative threat in their Rooneyless side. It's got all the makings of a classic. Or a narrow and disciplined away victory. Either way I'll bring you team news and other relevant multimedia content in the lead up to kick-off at eight. Here's a lovely preview: Wednesday Jan 4, 2012
Newcastle United v Manchester United
Sports Direct Arena
Kick-off: 20.00 GMT TV: Live Sky Sports 1, highlights, BBC1 Match of the Day. Newcastle (Probable, 4-4-2): Krul; Simpson, Williamson, Coloccini, Santon; Jonas, Tiote, Canabye, Ferguson; Ameobi, Ba
Out: S Taylor (Achilles), Marveaux (groin), Obertan (toe), Guthrie (groin), R Taylor (ankle), Lovenkrands (calf).
Test: Obertan (infected toe). United (Probable, 4-3-3): De Gea; Evra, Keane, Jones, Rafael; Park, Carrick, Valencia; Welbeck, Rooney, Berbatov.
Out: Evans (calf), Young (ankle), Fletcher (bowel condition), Vidic (knee), Fabio (hamstring), Owen (thigh), Cleverley (ankle) Bebe (knee).
Tests: Ferdinand (foot), Smalling (tonsillitis). Referee: Howard Webb (Matches 13, R3 Y41) Team News
Newcastle manager Alan Pardew will make a late check on Gabriel Obertan ahead of tthe visit of his former club. The midfielder has an infected toe, but is expected to make the game. Pardew otherwise has no fresh injury problems, with Danny Guthrie and Peter Lovenkrands close to returns. Steven Taylor and Sylvain Marveaux remain on the long-term casualty list. Meanwhile, Wayne Rooney is expected to return for Manchester United at Newcastle. It is believed Rooney and midfielder Darron Gibson both missed the New Year's Eve defeat to Blackburn after angering their manager by their performance in training after a Boxing Day night out. Chris Smalling (tonsillitis) and Rio Ferdinand (back) may return on Tyneside to bolster United's injury-ravaged squad as they look to keep pace with leaders Manchester City. Match Notes Wayne Rooney will be brought back in from the cold after falling out with Ferguson and his manager will be looking for a positive, rather than a sulky, reaction against a Newcastle side beaten only twice at home this season. The return of their talisman will be a big boost for a United side embarrassingly beaten at home by Blackburn in their last game, although Newcastle are a threat to anyone at the moment despite their own injury problems. Betting: Home 7-2, Away 8-13, Draw 13-5. Stat of the game: United are unbeaten in their last ten away games in the Premier League. Luke Edwards’ prediction: Newcastle United 2 Manchester United 2. Premier League

Secret of a man’s happiness: do the dishes for a quiet life
They may be written off down the pub as “under the thumb”, but husbands who do more chores in the home are happier than those who do not, according to experts at Cambridge University. Secret of a man’s happiness: do the dishes for a quiet life Photo: CORBIS By John Bingham, Social Affairs Editor

A study of men across seven countries found that those who shouldered a bigger share of domestic responsibilities had a better sense of wellbeing and enjoyed a better work-life balance. But experts suggested that, while this may be partly because they felt less guilty, the main reason could be that they had simply learnt the secret of a quiet life. Sociologists used data from the regular European Social Survey which compares the lifestyles of people across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Britain. All of the participants are asked standard questions used to measure their happiness or wellbeing such as whether they feel “fulfilled” in life and whether they wake up feeling refreshed. They were also asked a series of questions designed to measure their levels of “work-life conflict”. Related Articles

Household chores bad for heart
13 Jan 2011
The answers from men and women were then compared with separate questions dealing with how much time they spent on tasks like cooking, washing, shopping or DIY. The researchers expected to find that where men shouldered more of the burden, women’s happiness levels were higher. In fact they found that it was the men who were happier while their wives and girlfriends appeared to be largely unmoved. Those men who did more housework generally reported less work-life conflict and were scored slightly higher for wellbeing overall. Prof Jacqueline Scott, professor of empirical sociology at Cambridge, co-author of a book on gender roles in which the study is included, said this may be because more men support gender equality than in the past. But she added that it may also be that women nowadays are more likely to be vocal in making their feelings about lazy husbands known. “Times are changing,” she said. “As a more equitable philosophy becomes the ideal, if you are experiencing something which doesn’t live up to that to are more ready to express dissatisfaction – and certainly that is what is perceived by men. “They are picking up on more family conflict.” She added: “There were really good reasons from the literature for thinking that it would be women who really benefited if the men did more but that is not what we found and that is what is interesting. “I think that really is because by and large women have taken it for granted that they would have to do a double shift. “It is not that their wellbeing rises if he is doing more on this measure.” Mother Tongue
