Poor whites are being conned - 01/14/2009 | MiamiHerald.com
Posted on Wed, Jan. 14, 2009	Poor whites are being conned
By LEONARD PITTS JR.lpitts@miamiherald.comI keep thinking I should be mad at West Virginia.Not because Barack Obama was recently beaten like a red-headed stepchild -- to use my father's expression -- in that state's primary. No, I'm thinking I should be upset about why he was beaten.

So for me, the story here isn't simply the old, familiar tale of the nation's stark racial divide, but also another tale, just as old, less often remarked, of how the white poor and the black poor have long been kept at one another's throats as a means of keeping them from looking too closely or clearly at the w
