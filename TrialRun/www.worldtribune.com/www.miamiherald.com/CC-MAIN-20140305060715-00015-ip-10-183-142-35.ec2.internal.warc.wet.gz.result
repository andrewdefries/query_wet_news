DeMint to oppose Columbia, S.C., lawyer as federal judge - 03/08/2012 | MiamiHerald.com
Posted on Thu, Mar. 08, 2012	DeMint to oppose Columbia, S.C., lawyer as federal judge
James RosenMcClatchy NewspapersWASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday recommended that the full Senate confirm Columbia, S.C., lawyer Mary Geiger Lewis as a federal district judge in a vote of confidence that could yet run aground on partisan opposition.	Lewis's fellow South Carolinian, Sen. Lindsey Graham, was the only Republican who supported her, joining 10 Democrats in the judiciary panel's 11-6 vote.	Graham, of a Seneca, S.C., didn't speak at the committee hearing and said afterward only that he's confident the Senate will confirm Lewis.	But in a highly unusual stance for a home-state senator, Sen. Jim DeMint said after the committee vote that he will oppose Lewis, casting her confirmation in doubt.	DeMint, who voted last fall for two Obama judicial choices from South Carolina, said he's now rejecting all of the president's nominees to protest his winter recess appointments of four controversial nominees to avoid GOP opposition.	"President Obama has shown a complete disdain for the people's elected representatives and our duty to advise and consent on nominations," DeMint told McClatchy.	"Unless he revokes his unprecedented recess appointments that defied the constitutional role of Congress, I don't intend to support any of his judicial nominees this year," DeMint said.	DeMint was, however, willing to return the so-called 'blue slip' for Lewis that home-state senators may withhold from the Judiciary Committee.	By policy, the committee will not move forward on a nominating hearing unless both senators from the nominee's home state return the slips — though doing so does not commit a senator to supporting the nominee, according to the committee. DeMint's stance on Lewis once again puts him and Graham at odds over an Obama judicial nominee. Graham voted to confirm the president's two Supreme Court choices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, while DeMint voted against them. Both women now sit on the high court.	With the Senate on winter break, Obama on Jan. 4 named three people — Richard Griffin, Sharon Block and Terence Flynn — to the National Lab
