BY BARRY JACKSON
bjackson@miamiherald.com
Former Miami Dolphins great Dan Marino lost his marquee television job Tuesday when he and CBS parted ways after 12 seasons as an analyst on its NFL studio show.CBS also dropped Shannon Sharpe and hired former All-Pro tight end Tony Gonzalez for its pregame, postgame and halftime programming.Marino’s next career move is uncertain. His agent, Marvin Demoff, conveyed through his assistant that he would not be answering questions about Marino on Tuesday, and Dolphins owner Stephen Ross declined to respond when asked if he would have interest in hiring Marino. But the Dolphins have not pursued Marino this offseason, even though they were aware that he potentially would be interested in a role with the organization. According to an associate, Ross has felt no need to hire a Bill Parcells-type president who would oversee football operations.CBS Sports president Sean McManus said Marino’s departure “was a collaborative decision — us wanting to make some changes and Dan wanting to pursue other professional opportunities. We both decided it has been a great partnership. Dan remains a very good friend. He will hopefully find something every bit as challenging.” McManus said he wasn’t sure what opportunities Marino planned to pursue.CBS has a game analyst role open following the retirement of Dan Dierdorf, but McManus said that job was offered to neither Marino nor Sharpe. “Both are really good at studio analysis,” McManus said, adding he had no issue with Marino’s job performance. “We didn’t think they were interested” in the game analyst role.”CBS likely will add a fifth person, probably a former defensive player, to join James Brown, Gonzalez, Bill Cowher and Boomer Esiason on its studio show.Marino, 52, spent his entire 17-year career with the Dolphins, retiring after the 1999 season, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, his first year of eligibility. He had been with CBS since the start of the 2002 season and also appeared on HBO’s Inside the NFL (which now airs on Showtime) from 2002-07. Early in 2004, he returned to the Dolphins as senior vice president of football operations, but resigned three weeks later, saying the role was not in the best interests of himself or his family.Marino and the Dolphins spoke about a role two years ago, but the Dolphins never pursued the matter.
