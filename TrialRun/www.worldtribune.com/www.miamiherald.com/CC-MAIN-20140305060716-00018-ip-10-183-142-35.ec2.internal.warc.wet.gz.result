South Dade makes history with first trip to GMAC final BY WALTER VILLA The Miami Herald BY WALTER VILLA
Special to The Miami Herald
South Dade rallied for a 3-2 victory over Palmetto to advance to the school’s first GMAC final in girls’ soccer.The Bucs (14-1-2) will play defending GMAC champion Ferguson (15-3-1) at 7 p.m. Friday at Milander. “We’re making history,” Bucs coach Erin Shelow said. Early on, though, it looked like Palmetto would win and set up a rematch of the 2012 GMAC final. The Panthers (12-3) got on the board first in the 15th-minute on a goal by Sophia Paz.South Dade tied the score on a blast by Allyssa Cili, but Paz’s second goal gave Palmetto a 2-1 lead.That’s when the Bucs made their move, getting the equalizer by veteran Jada Hayes and the game-winner from tiny freshman Thalia Leal, who lofted a long boot over the Palmetto goalie.“I didn’t think it was going to go in,” said Leal, flashing a smile. The Bucs had chance to get a fourth goal when Isamar Duran hit the crossbar in the 72nd minute. Palmetto nearly tied it a couple of minutes later, but Ava Gruener’s shot when wide left, and the Bucs and backup goalie Andrea Bueno survived.Ferguson also had a close call in its semifinal, tying Miami Springs 1-1 at the end of regulation and then winning 4-2 on penalty kicks.After Ferguson’s Isa Jara scored early in the second half, Miami Springs (14-4-4) tied the score when Ale Salazar was dragged down in the box and converted her penalty kick. It was her fourth goal in two days.Ferguson got off to a bad start on penalty kicks when Angelica Gomez hit the right post, and Salazar made her shot. But Ferguson’s Jessica Suarez converted, and goalie Patricia Pinckombe dove to her left to stop Springs’ Debbie Yance to preserve a 2-1 lead. “I read her body positioning and her eyes,” Pinckombe said, “and then I just went for it.”Given that opening, Ferguson put the game away with shots by Jara, Natalie Valderuten and the clincher from Marcela Ramirez.“I was just hoping it would go in the net,” Ramirez said. “I was nervous.”Ferguson, which advanced to the semifinals on a forfeit when Goleman failed to have enough healthy players to start the match, was out of rhythm, according to its coach.“This was our first match in three weeks,” Richard Lopez said. “We should be much better on Friday.” ALL-COUNTYThe Miami Herald will publish its All-County Fall Sports section Jan.16.
