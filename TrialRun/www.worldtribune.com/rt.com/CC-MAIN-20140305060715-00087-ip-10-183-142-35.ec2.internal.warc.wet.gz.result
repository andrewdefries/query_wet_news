Verizon admits that governments request more customer information

Court, FBI, Intelligence, Internet, Law, Obama, Security, Snowden, USA Verizon Communications this week became the first American company of its kind to publish information about the number of requests for user data they received last year from federal investigators and law enforcement agencies.
Verizon’s so-called transparency report, released by
the telecom giant on Wednesday, reveals that local, state and
federal law enforcement agencies in the United States requested
customer information no fewer than 320,000 times during the last
calendar year. The country that sent in the second most requests
was Germany with 2,996.
“Overall, we saw an increase in the number of demands we
received in 2013,” the telecommunication company admitted,
“as compared to 2012.”
Within that batch from the US, Verizon acknowledged, were roughly
164,000 subpoenas, 70,000 court orders, 36,000 warrants and
roughly 50,000 emergency requests for information issued during
extreme circumstances.
Around 7,800 of those court orders required Verizon to provide
authorities with customer information — either related to phone
or internet use — in real time, and another 1,500 or so wiretap
requests also compelled the company to let law enforcement
monitor the content transmitted either online or over the phone
as it happened. Around 14,500 warrants were received from
agencies interested in accumulating stored content from Verizon,
including but not limited to emails and text messages sent
through their service.
Additionally, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation compelled
Verizon last year for customer information through National
Security Letters, or NSLs, between 1,000 and 2,000 times. The FBI
does not need to go to court to get a NSL authorized, Verizon
admitted, but rather must have a senior official certify in
writing that the information requested could be crucial to an
investigation. Companies are forbidden from explicitly
acknowledging how many NSLs they receive, however, and those
letters are regularly issued by the federal government with gag
orders that limit the customers in question from ever hearing
about a potential probe.
During a speech from Washington, DC last week, US President
Barack Obama said that telecoms will be allowed in the future to
release more information to the public about top-secret NSLs — a
decision that Verizon hailed in their report.
“In the United States, the government is especially suited to
report the number of demands it makes from such companies,”
Randal Milch, Verizon’s general counsel and executive vice
president of public police, law and security, wrote in an
accompanying blog post published this week. A framework for the government
to tell Congress about the number of wiretap orders, pen register
and trap and trace orders, certain emergency requests and
national security letters already exists, he said, adding,
“The United States government should expand on this existing
framework and report annually on the numbers of all types of
demands made by federal and state law enforcement to
telecommunications and internet companies for data regarding
their customers.”
Milch’s remarks were echoed by the American Civil Liberties
Union, who endorsed their report but insisted more should still
be disclosed.
“We applaud Verizon for finally making it clear how much
information is being demanded by the United States government
without a warrant, including location information, and for also
pushing for even greater transparency,” Nicole Ozer of the
ACLU’s Technology and Civil Liberties officer said when the report was issued.
At the same time, however, Ozer admitted that Verizon’s latest
disclosure proved true one of the ACLU’s biggest fears.
“As we long suspected, the vast majority of the demands for
information lack a warrant,” she wrote.
Also at issue, she added, was information about the actual number
of accounts that were surveilled through these requests. While
Verizon has indeed published numbers pertaining to the amount of
requests submitted to their company, nowhere in their report do
they say that each request is limited to a certain number of
customers.
“A single subpoena could, for example, request information
oneveryone,” TechDirt blogger Mike Masnick wrote on Wednesday. “While that may be an extreme
example, the point is that the number of requests doesn't really
tell you very much overall.”
Masnick went on to recall that a legal document disclosed by
former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden last year revealed
that the government had compelled Verizon for the telephony
metadata pertaining to millions of customers with a single
order authorized under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.
Where are the other Section 215 bulk-collection orders? Hard to
have a "vigorous debate" w/o them. http://t.co/tyVkcmNLtZ via

“Where are the other Section 215 bulk-collection
orders?” ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo tweeted earlier this
week. “Hard to have a ‘vigorous debate’ [without] them.”
Mr. Snowden is expected to answer questions from the public
during an online chat later on Thursday. His remarks will come
one week after Pres. Obama announced
a handful of changes to the National Security Agency documents he
helped disclose to the press starting last year.

So your comms corp has made millions in profit but you have to pay millions in tax ,then the man says we will cut your tax bill in half if you you give us the back door .
Well this is America its all about money an profit ,the share price will go up and the management can all have a big bonus .
Times this by every corp or company in the land and you end up with a tax deficiet ,then you have the info storage ,and with all of the other costs involved you end up with a country falling apart and owing trillions .
good luck uncle sam ,your going to need it !

it is clear that the NSA ability to spy on every aspect of our citizens lives is quickly turning into a animal out of control, that doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon, this is a criminal act against the citizens of the United States, local, state, and federal levels, it is the very basic foundation for the "Orwellian" ; society, and unless checked, will surly destroy us from within, nothing about what they are doing is keeping us safe, and studies have proven that fact, the very foundation on which this nation started on is at steak.

Basically they want everything, they feel they are entitled to everything. Why? Complete control. Americans better put up a brutal fight right now, if not freedom and privacy will be a thing of the past. We will be slaves to the elite who will tell us that it is in our best interest. The naive will believe this. Next will be microchips in our bodies to contain all banking, religious, political, and medical information. Should you not be a good little slave your chip will be shut off or flagged for detention. Is this the world you want to live in? raise your children in? 0
