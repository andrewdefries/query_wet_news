Bitcoin, Currencies, Education, UK The University of Cumbria in northwest England has become the first public university in the world to experiment with accepting bitcoin as tuition payment. It follows a similar move made by a private university in Cyprus at the end of last year.
The university announced its intention to accept the online
currency as payment on Tuesday.
“We are accepting bitcoin as a way of experimenting [with]
how it works for a major organization with many
departments,” said Professor Jem Bendell, director of the
university’s Institute for Leadership and Sustainability (IFLAS).
Initially, the bitcoin payments will only be accepted for two
courses at the university. As with Cyprus, the payments will
complement the course subject matter. The two courses to begin
accepting the payments will be the “Certificate of Achievement in
Sustainable Exchange” and the “Postgraduate Certificate in
Sustainable Leadership.” Both are already validated and accepting
students. The Bitpay system for the payments is already up and
running.
“We believe in learning by doing, and so to help inform our
courses on complementary currencies, we are trialling the
acceptance of them,” said Bendell.
However, the university released a statement: “[Students]
should only use this facility if they already have bitcoin, or
can receive Bitcoin donations in order to pay their fees,”
it said, warning its students off purchasing Bitcoin specifically
for the purpose of paying tuition fees.
“This is a trial move by the university, where we approach it
as a learning exercise and welcome feedback,” it said.
The institution lauded its own track record in dealing with such
procedures: “IFLAS has specialist knowledge in the field of
complementary currencies,” reads the statement.
“There is currently much misunderstanding about complementary
currencies, both misinformed criticism and superficial hype,
which is a reason for our courses on the topic. The bitcoin unit
may vary in value, and opinions differ on that value, yet the key
innovation is the system it is based on,” the statement
adds.
The University of Nicosia (UNic), one of the major English
language universities in the Mediterranean, became the world’s
first to accept bitcoin for tuition in November. The university
was beginning a new Master of Science course in Digital Currency.
Nic, formerly known as Intercollege, is the largest private
university in Cyprus with 5,000 students.
The online anonymous ‘cryptocurrency’ has seen unprecedented
success over the past year. Although it was initially associated
with illicit online activities, it skyrocketed to an all-time
high of $1000 per unit on the Mt.Gox exchange towards the end of
last year and is currently settled around that mark.
