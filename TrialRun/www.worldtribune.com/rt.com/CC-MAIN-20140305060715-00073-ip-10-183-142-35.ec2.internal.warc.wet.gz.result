Clashes, Conflict, Opposition, Politics, Protest, Security, Ukraine Ukraine’s interim interior authorities have disbanded the elite special force that participated in the Kiev clashes and the crackdown on the Maidan protesters.
It is yet unclear what will happen to the Berkut officers, acting
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.
“Berkut no longer exists,” Avakov wrote on Facebook
early Wednesday.
The force had about 4,000 thousand members across the country.
The news comes a day after several members of the Berkut force
were made to kneel on a stage in front of protesters in the
western Ukrainian city of Lvov and beg for forgiveness, while
locals shouted “Shame!” and threw small objects at them.
Berkut officers have complained of provocations by far-right
demonstrators, and threats to themselves and their families.
“On the houses where the members of the special forces live,
they paint: ‘You’re dead’ or ‘We’ll hang you and kill all your
family, one by one.’ It’s not ordinary people who are gathering
here,” Vladimir, a Berkut officer, told RT.
However, Berkut officers were greeted as heroes in the cities of
Donetsk and Sevastopol.
Authorities in Sevastopol have refused to comply with an order by
the interim interior minister, Arsen Avakov, to disband a Berkut
detachment. The head of the city government, Aleksey Chaly, has
called for all Berkut officers to come to live in Sevastopol with
their families. The forces’ officers were invited to join the
local Interior Ministry’s troops.
“These people have done their duty with dignity, have shown
themselves to be true men, and now are being thrown to the gang
of nationalists by their own ex-bosses,” Sevastopol mayor
Aleksey Chaly said, Sevastopol.su reported.

Well, they have two options: Release those police and officials whose only crime was the defense of themselves, their country and their families, or continue to subject them to the unjustified abuse they are facing currently... and accept the coming Russian troop deployment as the consequence for their barbarity.
My thoughts go out to those police and Berkut burned alive for fighting fascists, corrupt Western sympathisers and crazed anarchists...
