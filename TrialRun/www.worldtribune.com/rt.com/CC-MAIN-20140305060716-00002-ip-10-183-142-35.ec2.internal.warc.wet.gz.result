­Shaker Masri, a Chicago man accused of planning to join a training camp in Somalia in order to become a suicide bomber for terrorist groups, pleaded guilty on Monday.

Indonesian police arrest 62 over bar attack ­Authorities in Indonesia have arrested 62 people, most of them minors, for taking part in an attack on a bar in the south of the country’s capital, Jakarta. A group of around 150 youths armed with Samurai swords, sickles and golf clubs participated in the raid on Saturday, Hermawan, a local chief detective said. The group, calling itself the Prophet’s Defenders Council, shattered windows, broke doors and smashed bottles, saying they wanted to ensure that all bars were shut during the month of Ramadan. Habib Bahar, the group’s leader also detained in the arrests, was quoted by local media as saying that he regularly raids “sinful places” during the month of Ramadan. Although Indonesian authorities have ordered bars and nightclubs to close during the month of Ramadan, the ban has not been strictly implemented.

Thirty-three other defendants linked to the scam also received sentences of up to 25 years in prison. Only general information has been released about the case, described as the country’s biggest financial scam, and the names of the defendants have not been released. The linchpin defendant, nicknamed Amir Mansour Aria, is described as the head of a company which prosecutors say paid bribes to bank staff and managers, and used “incorrect connections with executive and political elements” to accumulate wealth.

North Korea has been hit by massive floods caused by torrential rainfall since July 18. Eighty-eight people have died in the disaster and thousands made homeless, North Korean media report. Many rice paddies and other farmland have been destroyed, driving grain prices up, according to defectors in neighboring South Korea. The torrential rain came after a severe dry spell that also caused a poor harvest.

The blocking of the BBC website has not been confirmed, and an Interfax correspondent in Dushanbe freely entered the BBC English, Russian, Tajik and Persian websites. The current blocking of access to news websites follows a police operation in the eastern Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region after the murder of a security service general on July 21.

Thousands rally against China patriotism classes in Hong Kong
­Tens of thousands of people, including students, teachers and parents, have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the upcoming introduction of Chinese patriotism classes, saying that this will lead to brainwashing among children, AP reports. The demonstrators carried placards and banners and shouted slogans calling for the government to withdraw its plan. The government’s decision to introduce the Moral and National Education curriculum sparked concerns among the public and pro-democracy activists that it will be used to brainwash children into supporting China’s Communist Party. Authorities deny allegations claiming that the classes are aimed at building Chinese national pride. The people of Hong Kong see the move as yet another attempt by China to limit democracy in the semiautonomous territory. On July 1, tens of thousands of people protested over the city's new leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who was chosen by an elite pro-Beijing committee and is widely suspected of having close ties to the Communist Party.

Night shifts can kill – research
­It has long been known that shift work disrupts the body clock and hormone production and through this can cause various disorders – from high blood pressure to diabetes and even cancer. In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that shift working was “probably carcinogenic”. Later, night shift work was even linked to some specific types of cancer. With all that, the overall impact on cardiovascular health had been unclear until Thursday, when an international group of researchers headed by Daniel Hackam from the Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre in Canada published their study in the BMJ (British Medical Journal). The results of their work are based on the analysis of 34 studies involving 2,011,935 people. The group has shown that shift work is associated with a 23-per-cent increase in the risk of heart attack, 24-per-cent rise in coronary events and five-per-cent more strokes. Night shift workers run the highest risk of 41 per cent for coronary conditions. Shift work was defined in the study as "regular evening or night schedules, rotating shifts, split shifts, on-call or casual shifts, 24 hour shifts, irregular schedules, and other non-day schedules." Studies on day workers were used for comparison.
