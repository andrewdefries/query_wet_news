Conflict, Human rights, Scandal, USA A 61-year-old neo-Nazi is trying to turn his small town in North Dakota into a stronghold for white supremacists.
Paul Craig Cobb, a neo-Nazi who lives in Leith, N.D., is quickly
buying properties in the small town, which has a population of 19
people. Abandoned houses are scattered throughout the desolate
town and there is only one storefront business for miles.
“I didn’t have a clue who the guy was until he showed up. All
I know is he bought that house sight unseen, $5,000 cash, and had
no idea what it looked like, where it was, other than he knew the
directions to get to Leith,” Mayor Ryan Schock told the
Hatewatch blog, which is a media project by a civil rights group
called the Southern Poverty Law Center. Cobb hopes to turn Leith into a haven for white supremacists.
Last year, he posted in an online forum called Vanguard News
Network (VNN), claiming that he will build an all-white bastion
of racists as fast as possible. Ultimately, he wants white
supremacists and neo-Nazis to take over the country and control
the government. He also hopes to rename the town “Cobbsville”.
Tenants of Cobb’s properties will be required to fly a “racialist
banner”, such as the Nazi flag, on a daily basis. They would also
be required to become legal residents of the state for voting
purposes, as well as join his recruiting effort to attract
“radical, hard-core” white nationalists.
North Dakota is already 90 percent white, and Grant County –
where Cobb currently lives – is 97 percent white, according to
the US Census. But for Cobb, the racial diversity in his state is
still too high for him to be satisfied.
Racist organizations across the country have already supported
the 61-year-old’s vision. Tom Metzger, founder of the White Aryan
Resistance, purchased one of Cobb’s abandoned lots for $1 – a
move that is largely symbolic. Alex Linder, operator of
VVN, also purchased a lot. Cobb told the Hatewatch blog that he
also donated several buildings to the National Socialist
Movement, which the New York Times in 2011 described as “the
largest supremacist group, with about 400 members in 32
states.”
“Imagine strolling over to your neighbors to discuss world
politics with nearly all like-minded folk,” Cobb wrote last
year in the VNN. “Imagine the international publicity and
usefulness to our cause! For starters, we could declare a Mexican
illegal invaders and Israeli Mossad/IDF spies no-go zone. If
leftist journalists or antis come and try to make trouble, they
just might break one of our local ordinances and would have to be
arrested by our town constable.”
In 2010, Cobb, who has both US and Canadian citizenship, was
arrested in Canada on federal charges of willful promotion of
hatred. Grant County Sherriff Steve Bay told the Bismarck Tribune
that he will keep an eye on Leith, but that Canada has no
interest in extraditing the man on hate crime charges.
Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report and Hatewatch blog,
said people should be concerned about Cobb, since “he’s one of
the most vicious neo-Nazi activists around.”
But now that the media has caught wind of Cobb’s plans, both
Potok believes the neo-Nazi will fail in his endeavor to create a
white supremacist haven. Bobby and Sherrill Harper, a mixed race
couple that currently resides in Leith, said they were vilified
on a white activism website, but that it only helps the word
about Cobb’s racist intentions get out and be put to a stop.
“The more the word gets out, the better chance that we can
move him out,” Sherrill Harper told the Bismarck Tribune.
“People are welcome if they’re here to improve our
community, but they’re here to bring hate,” Bobby Harper
added.

Lowellan Low S 25.08.2013 09:10 @spot me ... "it hides the fact that white europeans are really being wiped out of their countries by the complicity of capitalism" ... tell that to the Native Americans. Capitalism is an economic system. I don't see how a social movement to create an all white city has to do with capitalism, an economic system.

Being gay is ok! Homosexual marriages have just as much value as heterosexual marriages! Gay marriages should be legal! The "gay propaganda" bill is stupid! Let's see how long this will stay up.
