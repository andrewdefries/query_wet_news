In recent years many Americans have come to view their country’s vast prison population as a cause for soul-searching and lamentation.
There are still, however, a few bold spirits who recognise an excellent business opportunity when they see one. The one and a half million people languishing behind bars could also be seen as potential customers with a great deal of time on their hands.
With this vast untapped market in mind, Chris Barrett, a New York marketing executive, founded SendAPackage.com, launching a retail operation that is fast building a reputation as the Amazon for inmates.
A thicket of regulations

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CHILDREN’S FICTION COMPETITION ADMINISTRATION/ENTRY FEE Because of the large numbers of entries and the subsequent rise in the costs of administration, an administration/entry fee is now charged. A cheque for £15.00 (incl. VAT) must accompany each entry, made out to Chicken House Publishing Ltd. Overseas entrants should email tina@doublecluck.com for details of how to make the payment. The fee is non-returnable and is a condition of entry. There is no alternative form of payment available. If your cheque does not clear then the entry will automatically be disqualified. 1. The competition will run from April 7 to October 26, 2012. 2. Closing date for entries is last mail delivery October 26, 2012. 3. Unless otherwise stated, the competition is open to all entrants aged 18 or over, except employees of Times Newspapers Limited (“TNL”), Chicken House Publishing Limited (“Chicken House”) and their associated, affiliated or subsidiary companies, and their families, agents, or anyone connected in any way whatsoever with this competition. 4. Entry is limited to one per person. Entries must be by post. Email submissions will be rejected. Entries must be marked “Children’s Fiction Competition” and sent to Chicken House, 2 Palmer Street, Frome, Somerset, BA11 1DS. Entries must be clearly labelled with the entrant’s full name and contact details (including a postal address, email and telephone number) and must be received by the last post delivery on October 26, 2012. 5. By entering, all eligible entrants agree to abide by each and all of these terms and conditions. The Promoters (as referred to in term 21 below) reserve the right, with or without cause, to exclude entrants and withhold prizes for violating any of these terms and conditions. The Promoters reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions. Any amendments will be published on the Chicken House Website (www.doublecluck.com) and on The Times’ Website
6. Submission Criteria
Entries must be the original work of the entrant and not previously commercially published and distributed (self-published works are allowed). The entrant must not previously have had commercially published any whole children’s fiction book in any country, but may have had published an essay, story or poem in an anthology. The entrant must personally submit the entry: any submissions from or found to be from agents will be void and rejected. Entries submitted in previous years are ineligible. The entry must be a full-length manuscript of no more than 80,000 words, with a suggested minimum of 30,000 words. The entry should be suitable for a worldwide children’s audience aged between 7 and 18. Each entry must be accompanied by a brief synopsis, plot plan and a letter of submission explaining the book’s appeal to children. (A plot plan is a chapter-by-chapter breakdown, with a couple of sentences on each, paying attention to the roles of the main characters, dramatic high points, and the most important strands of the plot. The synopsis should be no more than a page, and should give an overview of the complete story, including key characters, events and settings.) Picture books and graphic novels will not be accepted and illustrations will not be considered. Entries must be written in English, typed (in a plain font, with a minimum 12pt font size), double-line spaced, with numbered pages. Entries that do not meet these criteria will not be read. Entries should be secured using elastic bands and placed in a cardboard folder (not a ring-binder or lever-arch file). The entrant must retain their own copy as no entries will be returned. Entries will be acknowledged only if accompanied by a self-addressed postcard, with sufficient postage, placed at the front of the cardboard folder. If entrants who have included a postcard have not received confirmation of receipt 28 days after submission, they should assume their entry has not been received. Entrants in this position may resubmit their manuscript with proof of prior entry postage. There will be no feedback on any entries, either during or after the competition. 7. There will be one prize winner. Subject to submission of a suitable creditworthy entry (as referred to below), the prize is the offer of a worldwide publishing contract with Chicken House (which shall be subject to negotiation and completion between Chicken House and the winner. If the negotiations between the parties fail, then the winner will receive the alternative prize set out below). The winner will be the entrant whose story, in the opinion of the judges, demonstrates the greatest entertainment value, quality, originality and suitability for children aged 7-18. However, in the event that the judges, in their sole opinion, determine that none of the entries are suitably creditworthy for a worldwide publishing contract the Promoters shall nonetheless select the best entry in accordance with these terms and conditions and award an alternative prize; namely, a full and detailed editorial consultation with Barry Cunningham and the Chicken House editorial team, including creative and technical advice on their entry. 8. Entrants retain all rights to their entries, except in the case of the winner to whom a publishing contract will be offered (as referred to in term 7 above). The winner will retain the copyright to the work and shall exclusively license worldwide publishing rights of the entry to Chicken House Publishing Limited on completion of the publishing contract. The publishing contract with the winner will be in line with industry standards for a debut children’s novel with a Royalty Advance of £10,000 from Chicken House. The winner will also receive an offer of representation from a leading literary agent. 9. Selection Criteria
All valid entries received before the closing date will be read by a Chicken House editorially managed team of experienced freelance readers who will select a longlist of approximately 20 entries based on the judging criteria set out in Clause 7. The longlisted entrants’ names and general locations will be published on the Chicken House Website www.doublecluck.com and at http://www.thetimes.co.uk/chickenhouse in January 2013. Each of the longlisted entrants will be notified and will receive a reader’s report giving editorial advice. A final shortlist
