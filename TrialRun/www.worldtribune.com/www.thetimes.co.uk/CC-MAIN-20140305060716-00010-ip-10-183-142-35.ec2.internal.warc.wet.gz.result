AFTER 37 years the King’s Singers must be on their fourth or fifth generation of chirpy choral chappies. But wits are clearly still sharp in the world’s most durable boy-band. Case in point?

Doubts over Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi’s conviction for the Lockerbie bombing are to be raised in two TV documentaries and a book.
