The chief executive of Prudential has been censured and the company fined £30 million by the Financial Services Authority for keeping secret its planned takeover of Asia’s AIA.
The criticism of Tidjane Thiam is the most high profile censure of an individual issued by the FSA and may stoke criticism of the businessman’s leadership style.
Prudential “failed to deal with the FSA in an open and co-operative manner” in preparing its audacious $35.5 billion (£24.5 billion) takeover bid for AIA in early 2010, the regulator said today.
Due to the “scale and size” of the proposed deal, which would have

Steve Jobs, chief executive officer of Apple, has been seen attending the California cancer clinic where the Hollywood star Patrick Swayze spent his final days, prompting speculation that he may be more ill than previously thought. According to the celebrity website radaronline.com, a “skeletal looking” Mr Jobs, 55, was photographed outside the Stanford Cancer Center in Palo Alto, California, where Swayze had chemotherapy before his death from pancreatic cancer in September 2009. Mr Jobs, who has survived pancreatic cancer, took indefinite medical leave from Apple last month. He took similar leave two years ago, when he had a liver transplant.

A Royal Navy officer has been posthumously awarded one of the country’s highest gallantry honours for his attempts to disarm a gunman who opened fire on board a British submarine.
Lieutenant-Commander Ian Molyneux, 36, was awarded the George Medal, as were two officials from Southampton city council, for their selfless courage during the incident on April 8 last year. Commander Molyneux was shot in the head as he tried to reach the gunman, a

Kieron Bryan said that he was looking forward to a good meal, a beer and to seeing his family and girlfriend after a Russian judge today ended two months of captivity and released him on bail. The former Times video journalist, who was detained following a protest at sea against Arctic oil drilling, broke into a broad grin and discreetly pumped his fists inside his pink defendant’s cage when he heard the decision. “It’s a huge relief,” he said. “Massive, and hopefully the end of the beginning.” This being Russia he was then led back to his cell for what

Though a recent report appeared to indicate that the drugs were not effective, many randomised controlled trials indicate otherwise
Sir, Your article (“Beta Blockers do little to reduce risk of heart attack and stroke”, Oct 3) reports data from an American registry of 44,700 patients and raises questions about the value of these commonly used drugs in patients with, or at risk of, heart disease.
A larger UK registry clearly shows that in one particular group of patients the use of beta blockers can indeed be life-saving. Analysis of the National Heart Failure Audit, of about 55,000 patients with impaired heart function, demonstrates that the prescription of beta blockers significantly reduces the risk of death over a three-year period (2009-12).
