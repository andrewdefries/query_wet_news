Bill Burns has been shown the door of the chief executive’s office at Spirent, five years after taking the helm.
The FTSE 250 telecoms group, which makes its money testing mobile networks for faults and bottlenecks, dismissed Mr Burns after a series of disappointments that resulted in a profit warning earlier in the year.
The board decided that Mr Burns, who will leave with a pay-off of up to £720,000 — a year’s salary — had become too slow-moving to keep up with developments in the telecoms market.
Spirent, which counts BlackBerry, Apple, Nokia and Samsung among its customers, has missed out

David Moulsdale has always had an eye for a deal, having built Optical Express from a single store in Kirkgate Centre, Leith, into one of Britain’s largest chains of opticians by scooping up larger players.
His latest move, however, has been one of necessity. He has acquired the entire debt owed by Optical Express to Royal Bank of Scotland to avert the prospect of the struggling optical empire sliding out of his control. The chain owed RBS more than £30 million and a request for a further loan to pay its workers was met with a threat to sell off

Gove scores own goal after joke falls flat
Michael Gove has landed in hot water after using sports analogies to compare two neighbouring, prestigious schools.
The Education Secretary likened the independent schools to Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, causing umbrage at one of them.
While making a speech at Highgate School in North London, Mr Gove compared it to Arsenal, and drew a parallel between nearby University College School (UCS) and Spurs.
He reportedly said: “UCS might think it’s special but the glittering trophies go to Highgate. I can tell I’ve just lost about half the audience, but the right half to lose.”
Arsenal have finis
Better-paid teachers ‘do not boost results’
Paying teachers slightly more does not improve classroom standards or lead to better results, research suggests.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found no difference in attainment in similar primary schools where teachers’ pay varied by 5 per cent owing to London weighting. Previous research in the United States has found that teachers are more likely to be incentivised by the school environment and type of pupils than salary.
The IFS study, while not conclusive, will heighten debate over government moves to encourage wider use of performance-linked pay rises in schools. It loo

Blair Jenkins: negotiations expected

Alistair Darling has accused the Nationalists of deceiving voters over an independent Scotland’s membership of the EU in a blistering attack that signalled an escalation of the political battle over Scottish separation.
The former Chancellor, who is head of the Better Together pro-Union campaign, said that the SNP had misled Scots by saying that negotiations over entry to the EU would not be necessary and accused them of selling “a one-way ticket to a deeply uncertain destination”. He claimed that they were “flying by the seat of their pants”.
Mr Darling’s attack came a day after Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy
