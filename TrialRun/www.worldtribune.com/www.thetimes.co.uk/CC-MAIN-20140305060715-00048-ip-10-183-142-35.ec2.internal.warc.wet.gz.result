Pride in our offshore wind farms is wildly misplaced. They are costlier than all other forms of energy
Here’s a short quiz. Question One: which source of energy is allowed to charge the highest price for its electricity? Question Two: which source of energy is expected to receive the greatest capital expenditure over the next seven years? The answer to both questions is offshore wind.
