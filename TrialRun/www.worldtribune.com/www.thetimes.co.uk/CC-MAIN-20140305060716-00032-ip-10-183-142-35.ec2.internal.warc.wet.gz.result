Doreen Lawrence: ‘You can’t trust the police’
Sean O’Neill
Crime and Security Editor
Published at 12:01AM, March 7 2014
Hundreds of political activists could have their convictions quashed after the publication of a report into the conduct of a secret undercover police unit in the Stephen Lawrence case.
The prosecutions of protesters from the far Left and Right, as well as animal rights campaigners, black ­justice groups and Irish republicans, will be checked against the records of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) amid concerns that some were unsafe.
The review will pave the way for a public inquiry into the SDS, which was set up by the Home Office in 1968, learnt its tactics from the intelligence services and evolved into an ­out-of-control wing of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch.
A report by Mark Ellison, QC, into the actions of the SDS in the Lawrence case revealed yesterday that it had placed a “spy in the camp” of the murdered black teenager’s family. Information gathered by that spy was fed back to the upper echelons of Scotland Yard.
Twenty-one years after Stephen’s death, and weeks before new inquests open into the Hillsborough disaster and with the Plebgate affair still rumbling, the latest disclosures are immensely damaging for confidence and trust in the Police Service and the international reputation of British policing.
Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said that Mr Ellison’s findings were profoundly disturbing and a judge-led public inquiry was necessary to get to the full truth.

Armed Ukrainian soldiers inside the Belbek military base disperse to their positions in the early morning following a tense night on March 3, 2014 in Lubimovka, Ukraine. Tensions at the base, where between 300 and 400 Ukrainian soldiers are stationed, were high overnight as a 4pm deadline the day before reportedly given by Russian troops for the Ukrainians to surrender passed and the troops feared the Russians might attack the base overnight. Many of the soldiers have family that live in apartment blocks just outside the base and about two dozen family members braved the cold ready and huddled with tea and cognac by a campfire outside, ready to block the road to the base entrance should the Russians appear.
