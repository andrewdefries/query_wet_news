Forex trader suspended as scandal widens
James Dean, Philip Aldrick and Juliet Samuel
Last updated at 10:22PM, March 6 2014
A senior currency trader who served on the Bank of England’s foreign exchange committee has been suspended by his bank, dealing a further blow to London’s position as the world’s leading centre for forex trading.
BNP Paribas, the French investment bank, has suspended Robert de Groot, its global head of foreign exchange spot trading, who joined the Bank of England’s chief dealers’ group in 2007, it emerged yesterday.
The chief dealers’ group — a committee of senior forex traders and Bank officials — was thrust into the spotlight this week after the Bank responded to allegations that it had turned a blind eye to warnings that currency markets were being manipulated. The Bank released a cache of minutes from meetings of the group, which revealed that potential manipulation of the forex markets had first been discussed nearly eight years ago — long before the Bank decided to investigate.
Mr de Groot is the fourth member of the chief dealers’ group to have been suspended by their employer since allegations of currency fixing surfaced last year. In all, 29 traders have served on the chief dealers’ group since it was created in 2005, according to minutes of the group’s meetings.
Joseph Landes, a senior currency trader at Bank of America, has also been suspended, it emerged yesterday. Mr Landes did not serve on the chief dealers’ group.
Politicians and former central bankers warned that the forex scandal had put the Bank’s credibility at stake. A second regulatory failure after Libo

Mystery Bitcoin creator ‘discovered’
His true identy has been shrouded in mystery for years, but now, possibly, he may have been uncovered.
Known as “the father of Bitcoin”, the digital currency worth billions, Satoshi Nakamoto appeared to vanish in 2010 when he stopped responding to all messages from Bitcoin’s early adherents.
Since then, wild theories have spread in the digital world about his existence. Some believed his name was the pseudonym for a whizkid hacker based in Tokyo. Others believed it was the name of a collective of computer programmers. Nobody has claimed to have met him in person.
But according to a report, he is a 64-year-old Japanese immigrant living in a small town in California. He has been described as a “amazing physicist” who worked on secret US government projects, and who spends his days tending to his passion for model train sets.
And his name really is Satoshi

Police investigate death of Bitcoin chief	Barclays to break link with PwC
Barclays is to part company with PwC, its auditor for the past 120 years. The bank is pre-empting British and European regulations designed to shake up the audit market. PwC’s auditing of Barclays has come under the spotlight, with the Financial Reporting Council in December dropping a two-year inquiry into its compliance reports.
PwC has been Barclays’ auditor since 1896, when Price Waterhouse first signed off on the bank’s accounts, and the last tender was ten years ago. While Barclays’ audit committee was satisfied with the PwC’s performance, the bank’s annual report discloses that it will start a tender next year or in 2016 and that PwC will not be invited to take part.
Barclays is anticipating a European Union regulation that will place a 20-year cap on auditors, while the Competition Commission is expected to implement its decision that companies should tender their auditing ever

Jennifer Lopez's Viva Móvil mobile store is aimed at Latino shoppers
Jamie McCarthy
Published at 12:01AM, July 27 2013
For those who like their economic signals sprinkled with stardust, Jennifer Lopez came to the rescue yesterday. The singer and actress opened her Viva Móvil mobile phone store in New York City, despite concerns from more hard-headed economists that the US recovery was stuttering. In its latest assessment, the International Monetary Fund noted the gains in stock markets and house prices but said that growth was likely to be lower than expected in the second quarter as America still faced “powerful

The United States has lined up a formidable display of firepower to strike at Syria, with up to ten warships, hundreds of aircraft and a huge arsenal of precision-guided missiles and bombs primed to hit key military targets around Damascus and deep into the country’s interior.
The force awaiting offshore appears to be more in tune with a large-scale strike mission than the limited attack originally promised by President Obama. US military chiefs have deployed sufficient weaponry to knock out the Syrian regime’s air defences, missile sites, airbases, chemical weapons plants and communications sites.
A comprehensive list of targets was

Apple won’t unlock dead woman’s iPad Apple has been criticised for refusing to unlock a dead woman’s iPad.
Josh Grant, 26, said his mother Anthea bequeathed the tablet to her family after buying the computer during her treatment for cancer.
After her death, they have been unable to unlock it despite supplying Apple with copies of her will, death certificate and a solicitor’s letter.
Apple has said that its security measures help its customers protect lost or stolen devices. Mrs Grant used it for games and video calls with her sons. In her will, she said her estate should be split between her five boys, with
GCHQ ‘watched millions on their webcams’
Yahoo! has angrily reacted to reports that British spies intercepted and stored webcam images from millions of its customers around the world, describing the practice as “a whole new level of violation of our users’ privacy”.
It is believed that GCHQ, with assistance from the US National Security agency, ran a surveillance programme that collected still images from webcam conversations held by Yahoo! users. It is understood that many sexually explicit pictures were also collected, though not intentionally.
The operation, called Optic Nerve, took place between 2008 and 2010, according to a
BlackBerry goes back to the future
The new chief executive of BlackBerry has returned the struggling company to its roots with the launch of a new smartphone in the style of its popular keyboard-centric models of yesteryear.
John Chen, chief executive of BlackBerry, dubbed the phone ‘the BlackBerry Classic’ although it will officially be called the Q20. The new handset will launch before the end of the year and will restore not only the famous keyboard but also the trackpad used to scroll through emails.
Mr Chen took over the company after a disastrous 2013 when it attempted to compete with Apple and Sams
First look: Samsung Galaxy S5
Samsung had something to prove with its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S5, which was unveiled this week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The Korean company has publicly stated its dissatisfaction with the sales performance of the S4, launched last year, despite the phone maintaining Samsung’s status as the world’s largest phone maker.
The new version of the Galaxy is certainly an improvement that had the retailers at the conference licking their lips in anticipation. A bigger brighter screen and a tag line claiming the phone to be the fastest on the market
