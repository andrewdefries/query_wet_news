A Middle Eastern buyer salvaged the rump of La Senza yesterday, leaving more than 100 stores and concessions in the hands of the administrators. Alshaya will run 60 stores under licence from Limited Brands, which owns the La Senza brand outside Europe and Victoria’s Secret the American lingerie chain. KPMG, the administrator, said that the closure of the stores and concessions would put about 1,300 staff out of work. Alshaya is predominantly a franchise partner for overseas retailers opening stores in the Middle East. The deal was made possible by the approval of Limited, which had pre-emptive rights over the

Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted should all be allowed to build new runways in place of “insane, stupid, hare-brained” plans for a Thames Estuary airport, Michael O’Leary told MPs yesterday.
Private investors would finance three new runways for the main London airports “in a flash” if the Government gave the go-ahead, the Ryanair boss said.
Mr O’Leary told the Commons Transport Committee that he did not welcome the appointment of a government-backed commission to study how to keep Britain ahead as an aviation hub. He said that the commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, the former head of the Financial Services

UKIP kicked off its by-election campaign offensive in Wythenshawe and Sale East yesterday with the arrival of Lisa Duffy, its party director, in a minibus full of leaflets. After the sudden and unexpected death of the well-liked Labour MP Paul Goggins last week, UKIP has wasted no time mobilising its forces for the inevitable battle to decide his replacement in the south Manchester constituency. It is a tale of two halves. Wythenshawe, boasting the insalubrious accolade of being “one of Europe’s largest housing estates”, is a sprawling working class area. Next to it lies the middle class town of Sale.

Soul singer who became the lead vocalist of his musical heroes the Temptations after leading a tribute band that covered their songs
Damon Harris went overnight in 1971 from leading a Temptations tribute group to singing with the original hit-making line-up, who were his musical heroes. Aged 20, he was a decade younger than the other Temptations, who had a string of big hits behind them, including Too Busy Thinking About My Baby, which Harris had covered with his group, the Young Tempts.
