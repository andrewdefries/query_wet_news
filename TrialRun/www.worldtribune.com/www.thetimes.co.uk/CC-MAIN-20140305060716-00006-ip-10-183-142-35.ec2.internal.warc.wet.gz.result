Britain’s biggest bank has been accused of tax evasion, money laundering and acting like a “gang of swindlers” by the Argentine Government.
The AFIP tax agency in Buenos Aires filed a complaint against HSBC yesterday alleging that the bank had helped companies to evade 224 million pesos (£29 million) in taxes and conspired to launder a further 392 million pesos.
The accusations come just three months after HSBC paid $1.9 billion in penalties to settle claims of money laundering and sanctions busting in the United States and Mexico. The bank, which is the seventh largest in Argentina, also came under

Society and the workplace need to catch up with the realities of shared parenting made possible by new legislation
Next Monday the Children and Families Bill will have a second reading in the House of Commons.

The emotionally scarred town of Sandy Hook has been paying tributes today to the teachers who lost their lives trying to protect their young students from gunman Adam Lanza.
One of the six adults to die at Sandy Hook Elementary School was Vicki Soto, a 27-year old first-grade teacher.
According to family members she put herself in front of her young children to protect them from the gunman, although police have not yet given details of what happened at the school.

Skip the golf - the awe-inspiring beaches, cliffs, pine forests and rivers of Costa Vicentina are well above par
