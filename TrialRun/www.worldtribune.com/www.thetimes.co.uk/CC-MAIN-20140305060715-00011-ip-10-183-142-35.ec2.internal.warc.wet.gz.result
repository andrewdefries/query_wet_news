This was the year of the well-behaved. Emeli Sandé, talented, unfailingly polite and musically just a tiny bit dull, was the star of the 2013 Brits with two awards. Ben Howard, nice guy, clean-cut Devonian surfer dude and musically massively dull, also won two. Even Coldplay, the band that has ensured being in a stadium rock band need not contravene health and safety standards or recommended alcohol levels, inexplicably beat the far wilder and more exciting Rolling Stones as best live act. The genuinely unlikely success story Mumford And Sons (posh boys, banjos, million-sellers) were deservedly the best group, even

The decision by Alisher Usmanov, the Uzbek oligarch, to float MegaFon, his telecoms company, on the London Stock Exchange has once again thrown the spotlight on foreign companies that choose to list in the UK.
Look down the list of FTSE 100 stocks and you will find a string of overseas-based businesses. Antofagasta, Evraz, Fresnillo and Kazakhmys are just a few of the companies with roots thousands of miles from the UK who have chosen to seek a London listing for their shares.
So what is the attraction of a London listing and what are the benefits and pitfalls for

The top fund managers like to keep their investment secrets to themselves, so ordinary investors normally have little chance to learn much about them. Here Times Money has picked the brains of some of these experts and come up with ten things the professionals know that the average private investor does not. 1. John Bennett Henderson European Selected Opportunities Fund “The single most important factor in stock selection is the price you pay for the asset. We do not care whether it is a value stock or a growth stock, or in which country it is based. “You might think

Times+ members can download a free eBook edition of The Times 2012 A Year In Review: Arts.
In 2012, the Times’ art critics reviewed more than 1,000 concerts, shows, films, books, and performances. And that’s not counting the hours of television watched and albums listened to. It is a considerable undertaking, especially as the reviews often have to be composed in 90 minutes and condensed into 500 words.
Here is a collection of some of the things that those critics — including Rachel Campbell-Johnston, Debra Craine, Will Hodgkinson, Richard Morrison, Kate Muir, Libby Purves, Andrew Billen and Erica Wagner - really loved in the past year.
You will find some the sharpest writing in journalism, with opinions delivered crisply and praised lavished only after careful consideration.
So if you want to know what The Times thought about Skyfall, Springsteen, Hilary Mantel’s Booker-winner, Lucien Freud at the National Portrait Gallery, A Doll’s House at the Young Vic or Parade’s End (plus many, many others) then this is the place to find out.

Brendan Rodgers has stopped short of saying he will take Liverpool off the pitch if their black players are abused in tonight’s Europa League tie away to Zenit St Petersburg, instead placing the onus on Uefa and the match officials to deal with any incidents of racism. Rodgers insisted he had no qualms about naming Glen Johnson, Andre Wisdom and Raheem Sterling in the squad that travelled to Russia yesterday, despi
