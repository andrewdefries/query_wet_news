Northern trio Darkstar have undergone an impressive metamorphosis since they emerged from the dubstep scene in 2007. The addition of choirboy-on-acid vocalist James Buttery has added real depth to the warped psychedelic pop of their second album. The twinkling electronics and skittering rhythms of Timeaway and Armonica echo Radiohead circa Kid A, while the choral prog of A Day’s Pay for a Day’s Work will delight fans of Pink Floyd. They break out of the reverie with the joyous double hit of Amplified Ease and You Don’t Need a Weatherman, both driven by giddy, mantric vocal repetitions that mimic Animal Collective.

Businesses have cut their investment to the lowest quarterly level since the beginning of 2011, dealing a blow to hopes for a durable economic recovery.
The Office for National Statistics reported that companies invested £28.7 billion in Britain during the second quarter, down 2.7 per cent on the first quarter and 8.5 per cent from a year earlier. The figures suggest that companies felt there was not enough customer demand to convince them to splash out on expanding their productive capacity.
The numbers were released alongside gross domestic product figures which showed that the economy grew by an unrevised 0.7

Aviva has offloaded its American business for a higher than expected $1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) in the latest success for the turnaround plan of John McFarlane.
Britain’s second-largest insurer has been in talks to sell Aviva USA for several months, as it moves to dump unwanted assets and shore up its capital base.
Its expensive foray into the US effectively began in 2006 when it forked out $2.9 billion to buy AmerUS, a life and annuities business.
Mr McFarlane, the chairman, has already briefed investors that a sale of the US division, which requires extensive amounts of capital, would come

The Great Wall of China was once a very great wall indeed. A new survey shows that all the bits joined together would have stretched halfway round the equator.
State archaeologists have declared the Great Wall to be 21,196.18km (13,137 miles) long — more than double the previous estimate. The figure includes immense stretches that have vanished or are visible only to the trained eye.
The new length represents several times the width of China and it could still be selling the world’s biggest man-made structure short, possibly to the tune of 30,000km.
The latest survey confirmed longstanding fears that China’s
