First the diet and now the exercise, for people who don’t like either John Angerson

Dr Michael Mosley, the man behind the 5:2 phenomenon, took part in a webchat with Times readers. Read it back here
Fast Exercise, the new book by Dr Michael Mosley, is based on a surprising and radical claim — that you can get fitter, healthier and better toned with just a few minutes of intense exercise a day, three days a week. In a series of exclusive extracts published daily in The Times, the doctor and dieting expert has shared his tips for high intensity training (HIT), including how to change your body in under 8 minutes a day and the 4-minute paunch-busting exercises for men. Times readers took part in a live webchat with Michael. You can read back the questions

Surrogacy deal left ‘mother’ with no claim over son
A High Court judge has warned of the dangers of informal surrogacy arrangements after a “turkey-baster” style insemination left a mother with no parental rights over her baby.
The warning came after the boy, now 3, effectively ended up with two mothers after the woman did a deal with a friend who was “articifially inseminated at home” with the husband’s sperm.
However, the woman’s marriage broke down within months of the boy’s birth and she found that she had no parental rights because she was not the boy’s legal or biological parent.
The father and the surrogate mother appear on the boy’s
Judges attack plan to turn courts into businesses
Senior judges have delivered a scathing attack on ministers’ plans to turn the courts into a profit-making business through huge fees charged to litigants.
Plans for higher court fees from the spring to raise £190 million a year and enable the civil and commercial courts to subsidise loss-making family courts have been condemned as “unworkable”.
In response to a consultation paper from the Ministry of Justice, the judges warn that “great care and precision” would be needed to take forward the proposal “to avoid not only injustice but also damage to the international posi
Widow wins battle to preserve husband’s sperm
A 28-year old widow shed tears of joy today after winning a two-year legal battle to be allowed to keep her dead husband’s sperm and have his children in the future. Beth Warren, a 28-year-old physiotherapist from from Birmingham, could not contain her emotions as a High Court judge told the court that there was no doubt her husband intended her to have this choice after his death.
Previously, the UK fertility regulator had imposed a time limit beyond which the sperm would be destroyed, meaning she was faced with the impossible choice between starting IVF treatment whil
Weird cases: love me, love my real estate
When real estate and real love become entangled, the law always has a challenge in unthreading the knots. In Japan, a group of single men and women are suing real estate agents for 200 million yen (more than £1 million), alleging that they were tricked into buying property by misrepresentations of love. At the heart of the action is an alleged deception that estate agents had feigned romantic love for clients to persuade them to buy property as their first home together. The 12 plaintiffs, two men and ten women, are all in their early thirties to forties. The plaint
A far from academic contribution to opening Supreme Court doors
In 1982, a young academic, Alan Paterson, published a remarkable book, The Law Lords. At a time when most judges believed, like Lord Justice MacKinnon in 1940, that “the best judge” is the one “whose name is known to the fewest readers of The Daily Mail”, he persuaded many of the senior members of the judiciary to talk about how they decided cases. Professor Paterson has returned to his subject in Final Judgment: The Last Law Lords and the Supreme Court (Hart Publishing, (25).
Professor Paterson has interviewed most of the judges who sat on the Appellate Committee of th

In 2008, in the ecstasy of a first trophy for La Roja in almost half a century, Spain’s players celebrated with a raucous conga past a vanquished, and distinctly unamused Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was in the middle of a live television interview. The party had started and it would last for days. Two years later, in South Africa, they drank beer in the Soccer City dressing room and kept passing around
