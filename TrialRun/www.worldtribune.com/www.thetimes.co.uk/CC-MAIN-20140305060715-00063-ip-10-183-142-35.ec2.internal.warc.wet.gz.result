Wages of Spin Only a few days after Ed Miliband called for transparency in politics, Labour has slipped back into its old ways of censorship. The makers of a play satirising the last Prime Minister have been told that they will not be allowed to advertise it at the Labour conference in Brighton. Kevin Toolis, the writer and director of The Confessions of Gordon Brown, which will be on in Edinburgh before going to Brighton, was told he could buy an eighth-page advertisement in the conference magazine for £600 but overnight the deal was cancelled. Toolis says: “The only slot

Steve Clarke, the West Bromwich Albion head coach, has revealed that he was sacked by Liverpool as he prepares for the Barclays Premier League match against the Merseyside club tomorrow. In what promises to be one of the most eye-catching opening-day encounters, Clarke, the assistant to Kenny Dalglish at Anfield until their departure this summer, will pit his wits against Brendan Rodgers, Dalglish’s successor, at The Hawthorns.
