Welcome Break, which runs 29 sites with a turnover of more than £600 million, said that it had secured £221 million of senior debt from a consortium of eight banks and £130 million of mezzanine finance from GSO Capital Partners, the credit division of Blackstone.
Rod McKie, the chief executive, said he was seeking new sites on trunk roads and was upgrading its existing sites with brands including Starbucks, Waitrose and Days Inn.

The best that can be said about the Chancellor’s new Help to Buy scheme, designed to entice homeowners to move up the housing ladder, is that it cuts out the middle man. In a future housing market crash we won’t have to suffer the sight of reckless and greedy bankers being bailed out with our money as they sink beneath a burden of bad housing loans. We will be bearing the losses directly.

The United Nations has called for an investigation into hormone-disrupting chemicals found in everyday objects, which scientists believe could explain problems ranging from poor semen quality to low birthweight.
Evidence is mounting that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which exist in pesticides, electronics, cosmetics and food additives, become a health risk when they enter the environment, the UN Environment Programme and World Health Organisation said in a report.
