The box containing Paula Gilfoyle’s diaries and mementoes was presented to Eddie Gilfoyle’s defence team by Merseyside Police in August 2010 but its provenance remains a mystery.
Merseyside Police conducted the investigation into Mrs Gilfoyle’s death in 1992, resulting in her husband’s conviction for murder at Liverpool Crown Court in 1993. But the box had an exhibit-type label on it from Lancashire Constabulary.
This neighbouring force had been invited by the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) in 1994 to review the conduct of the murder investigation.
Lancashire Constabulary seized some exhibits from the Merseyside force and recategorised them. It is unclear

It is easy to get carried away with the potential, both for good and for harm, of synthetic life. The creation of an organism with genetic instructions written by human beings is an extraordinary achievement. Quite what its implications will be, though, remains an open question.
