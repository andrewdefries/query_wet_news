QPR manager is happy to make fun of himself
Harry Redknapp is not the first person to suggest that the fine ladies and gentlemen — mainly gentlemen — of the FA may not be the sharpest knives in the drawer. He is not the first to question whether that venerable old institution, 150 years young, may not be entirely fit for purpose.
Still, though, something jarred when reading the criticism of the FA bound within the weighty, leather-backed tome that is Always Managing, Redknapp’s long-awaited autobiography.
“I wouldn’t trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it,” he writes. “How would they know? What clubs

The discovery of the airborne bacteria was made by carefully examining hailstones, which were found to contain many organic substances
Clouds are alive with bacteria, even tens of thousands of feet high in the atmosphere, and the microbes could be playing a big part in our weather, even helping to drive violent storms. Research has discovered that storm clouds have lots of bacteria, and these appear to be species usually found on plants. Some of the bacteria found are already known to help ice crystals form, and high in the atmosphere they could give ice crystals a platform to grow on until the ice eventually falls as snow or hailstones, or melts into raindrops, depending on the air temperature.
