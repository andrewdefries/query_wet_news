Love the "in Florida" comments. Most of you that make those comments probably don't realize that well over half of the people in Florida (especially the southern part )moved there from the NE US, and of course brought all the looney-tunes with them.

Shame it is so much. Yes, I know they store it for years, but for sadly many do not have the luxury of having thousands lying around to spend this on. With the squeeze from the government and cost of living to pay for. Your email address:

Harry won't like that! Taylor Swift cosies up to yet another new man on the set of her new music video

She has the reputation of being somewhat of a maneater, and Taylor Swift did nothing to dispute that image on the set of her latest music video.Despite reportedly dating Harry Styles, the star was spotted cosying up to a mystery man as she shot scenes for her I Knew You Were Trouble video in Downtown Los Angeles on Sunday.The man, presumably an actor in the new music video, protectively put his arm around the love-addicted singer as she sported a new pink dip dye hairdo. What happened to Harry? One man is not enough for Taylor Swift as she happily cosies up to a mystery man on the set of her new music video
Wrapping her arms around the good looking dark-haired beau, Taylor looked drunk on love as she stared deep into the hunky new man's eyes.Letting go of her normal primmed long blonde hairstyle, the 22-year-old pop star donned a ratty new shoulder length hairdo with pink died ends.Sporting a rock chick outfit, the star finished off her look with a leather jacket and cut-off denim shorts. No, YOU are trouble: The singer was shooting scenes for her new music video I Knew You Were Trouble
Is she acting or is this real? It's hard to tell with Taylor's ever changing love lifeMeanwhile, the lucky fella looked every inch the Brooklyn hipster in a fedora hat, skinny jeans and plaid shirt.The video shoot followed a night at the American Music Awards, where Taylor picked up a gong for Best Female Country Artist.Taking to her Twitter page, the Love Story singer wrote: 'Thank you so much for the AMA! You're unreal. I went straight from the awards to a night video shoot. Long day but so worth it.' Love is her drug: The 22-year-old was seen canoodling with One Direction's Harry Styles just a few days ago According to reports, Taylor has recently reignited her romance with 18-year-old One Direction star Harry Styles.The couple were said to have dated earlier this year, but broke up after womaniser Harry was pictured locking lips with a mystery blonde.However, the two pop stars were spotted canoodling and holding hands backstage at the U.S. version of X Factor just a few days ago, which was confirmed by its host Mario Lopez. I got this: The star had no problem pretending she was in love with her hunky co-star
Both stars are keeping tight lipped about their affair, though it isn't the first time Taylor has gone after a teenage boy.She only recently broke up with fellow 18-year-old Conor Kennedy, with whom she enjoyed a brief romance over the summer.Her long list of famous exes include said Conor and Harry, as well as Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Joe Jonas, Cory Monteith and Taylor Lautner.
