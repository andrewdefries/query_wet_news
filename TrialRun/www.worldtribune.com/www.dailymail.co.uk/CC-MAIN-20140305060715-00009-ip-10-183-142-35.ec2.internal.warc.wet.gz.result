Tight-lipped: Sarah Catt has refused to co-operate with police after pleading to aborting her unborn child in the final week of her pregnancy
For several weeks after Sarah and Stephen Catt’s Caribbean wedding, both their families talked about how impossibly romantic it had all been. Watched by their two young children as well as their parents and siblings, the bride and groom exchanged vows at the end of a wooden jetty jutting out into the sea on the island of Antigua.The couple were so overcome by their emotions, according to one who saw them, that they cried throughout the entire ceremony.It seemed a fitting tribute to the pair’s loving, decade-long relationship, which began when Stephen, a 41-year-old electrical engineer, met Sarah Moran when she was working as
a barmaid in his local pub in Bridlington, North Yorkshire.By
the time they tied the knot, the pair already had two children, a ten-year-old girl and eight-year-old boy, who were bridesmaid and page boy at the wedding. To
an outside observer, the fact that Sarah fell pregnant again shortly after her May 2009 honeymoon would have seemed like the icing on the cake.But three years on from that dream wedding, the couple’s apparently idyllic relationship has taken a nightmarish twist. This week, 35-year old Sarah pleaded guilty to aborting her unborn child in the final phase of her pregnancy after illegally buying a drug via the internet.In a highly unusual and disturbing case which has left police officers baffled, no one knows whether the baby was alive or dead when it was born — or, indeed, what happened to it afterwards.Sarah,
who works as a secretary for a translation company in York, still refuses to speak to investigating officers about what she did with her child, despite the threat of life imprisonment hanging over her. Her
devastated husband is also said to be entirely in the dark about both the pregnancy and the horrifying way in which it was deliberately ended.
However, the family confirm that Stephen — who is back at the family home with their children — is standing by his wife.
As
things stand, Sarah Catt, whose bail address is a tiny bedsit near Leeds, appears prepared to take her secret to prison with her when she is sentenced in September, leaving those who attended her picture-perfect wedding utterly stunned.
‘None of my family has been told anything,’ says Sarah’s father-in-law, Roger Catt, who knew nothing of his daughter-in-law’s crime until he read newspaper reports of her appearance at Leeds Crown Court this week. ‘We thought we knew Sarah, but maybe we didn’t know her at all.’ More...
Divorced. The children have left home. If the phone rings, it's only a call centre... I admit it, I'm lonely
His wife, Pat, who is stepmother to Sarah’s husband Stephen, admits that the worst possible thoughts have come into their minds, including questioning Sarah’s fidelity — particularly considering Stephen works away from home about one week in every four.‘She has done a terrible, terrible thing, but she must have had her reasons because she is quite right in the head.‘We thought she was absolutely fabulous so we are asking ourselves: “Why would she do this? Why did she not confide in us? Why would she put us through this?” ’Officers from North Yorkshire police are still asking similar questions.Chief Inspector Kerrin Smith told the Mail this week: ‘Sarah Catt has not co-operated with the investigation at any stage and so the question: “What happened to the baby which Catt was carrying?” remains unanswered. To date, no child or remains of that pregnancy have been traced.’ Certainly, those who know the mother-of-two find it hard to comprehend that she could do something so desperate as to abort her own baby so close to birth.On the surface, at least, the Catts seemed no different to any other young close-knit, middle-class family. Sarah was born in Bridlington, North Yorkshire, to Judy Moran and her husband Jim, a former radio engineer who ran a tobacconist shop in the town until his retirement. She has two brothers, Christopher, 32, and Stephen, 37.Two years ago, the Morans moved from Bridlington to Sherburn-in-Elmet near Leeds to help Sarah and Stephen care for their children. ‘Sarah has the most wonderful parents, family and brothers,’ says Pat Catt. ‘They are such a close-knit family.’‘Sarah Catt has not co-operated with the investigation at any stage and so the question: “What happened to the baby which Catt was carrying?” remains unanswered. To date, no child
or remains of that pregnancy have been traced.’ When she met Stephen, Sarah was working part-time as a barmaid at The Seabirds Inn in Bridlington while studying to be a paralegal secretary. She eventually found work in a solicitor’s office in York but, a couple of years ago, changed jobs and moved to work for a translation company in the city.When their son first introduced his new girlfriend, the Catts were delighted by her. ‘She’s a wonderful and lovely, intelligent girl,’ says Pat. ‘We just can’t believe what has happened.’But strangely — and perhaps significantly — the family recall that when Sarah fell pregnant with each of her two children, she did not realise she was expecting until she was well into the second trimester — at around six months. Stephen broke the news on both occasions,’ recalls Roger, ‘starting his announcement by saying: “I hope you’re sitting down . . .’”But once the children arrived, Sarah appeared to throw herself into motherhood wholeheartedly.According to her father-in-law: ‘She has two lovely children she adores. She has always been a doting mum.’Summers were often spent with picnics on Bridlington beach where the family had a chalet. Sarah and Stephen were also keen music enthusiasts and enjoyed attending Glastonbury and the Isle of Wight Festivals.But in August 2010, just a couple of months after she aborted the baby, the Catts moved to a different house in Sherburn-in-Elmet in Leeds. Those who lived close to the Catts at their former address had no idea that Sarah was ever pregnant — or that the pregnancy had been ended barely a couple of months before the family moved.‘She never looked pregnant while she was living here,’ says one neighbour. ‘In fact, she had lost quite a bit of weight in the previous year.’In the months before they moved, Sarah decorated the sitting room of her home with wedding photographs from Antigua.‘They were so happy at going abroad to get married,’ says another neighbour who used to feed Sarah’s cat when she was away. ‘She was so proud to show off the photographs.’‘She was a nice, bubbly girl. The children were beautiful. They were always well turned-out. They seemed a normal happy family. They went out to picnics and the park and did normal family things.’But there were hints that all might not have been plain-sailing in the couple’s relationship.Another neighbour reports hearing the couple rowing frequently. ‘They used to have some right old ding-dongs,’ she says. And not long after the Catts moved elsewhere, the new owners of their terraced home began to be pestered by debt collection agencies, searching for Sarah under her maiden name, Moran.‘The people who bought their house had no end of trouble from the bailiffs,’ says the neighbour who heard the Catts arguing. ‘They had to put a notice in the window saying: “Sarah Moran doesn’t live here any more. Debt collectors and bailiffs stop contacting us.” ’Stephen’s father and stepmother, Roger and Pat Catt, say they were not aware of any problems in Sarah and Stephen’s relationship — although looking back, they say they saw less of Sarah than they would have expected over the past couple of years. ‘Stephen came to visit, bringing the two children for trips to Bridlington beach,’ says Pat. ‘We saw Sarah at their new home and were treated like royalty. No one said a word about any problems. She obviously kept her pregnancy secret.’She admits over the past few days the family have agonised over why she would have done such a thing. It was in March 2010, less than a year after the Catts’ wedding, that Sarah underwent a hospital scan which revealed she was two days short of being 30 weeks pregnant. Whether or not she knew that she was expecting before then is a mystery. Pat Catt believes that judging by how long it took Sarah to realise she was pregnant during her previous two pregnancies, ‘she would not have known she was pregnant’. She adds: ‘The other times it took four to six months for her to realise.’The May 2010 hospital scan was the only ante-natal appointment Sarah kept, but once her details were registered on the NHS computer system, the alarm was raised by medical staff when no birth was registered.According to Chief Inspector Kerrin Smith, when Sarah was questioned by police, she would only say that she had undergone a legal abortion. Chief Insp Smith says: ‘Throughout the investigation she has claimed that this pregnancy was terminated legitimately even though that would not be legally possible. ‘A legal termination can be carried out only up to 24 weeks in normal circumstances unless there are dire medical requirements to go beyond this. There were none in this case.’While Sarah’s husband appeared to know nothing of what his wife had done, a search of the family home and checks on Sarah’s computer revealed that she had purchased medication to facilitate the labour and delivery of a child.The date of purchase revealed that she must have taken the drug in the final week of her pregnancy, at a time when the baby would have been perfectly viable.The drug she used was misoprostol — usually prescribed to prevent steroid-induced gastric ulcers. The drug causes powerful uterine contractions and opens up the cervix and is widely used to induce medical, rather than surgical, abortions.Although misoprostol is legally available in the UK only when prescribed by a doctor, it is easily available via US-based websites which sell the drug under the brand name Cytotec for around £2 each. Information is readily available about what dosage should be taken to induce an abortion depending on how pregnant a woman is. The drug, which can be taken orally or vaginally, usually starts to work within four hours.What happened after Sarah took the medication she ordered online is perhaps the most disturbing part of this story. Considering how advanced her pregnancy was, her baby could well have been born alive. Indeed, in the months that followed her initial arrest in September 2010, police checked national databases for abandoned babies in the UK and conducted DNA tests on those born at around the same time. All the tests were negative.For now, then, police believe Sarah Catt’s child is dead but the tragic events that drove her to commit such a desperate act have yet to be unravelled.Sarah Catt and her parents declined to discuss the case when approached by the Mail this week. A relative insisted: ‘The family have no comment. There are innocent people involved here, including children. In the circumstances, it’s best to say nothing.’Having pleaded guilty to administering poison with intent to cause miscarriage, Sarah is due back in court on September 17 for sentencing but will first undergo a psychiatric assessment. The outcome of this will be crucial in helping The Honourable Mr Justice Maddison decide how to deal with her. This week, he hinted at the unique nature of the case when he said: ‘There are highly unusual circumstances here.’In many ways, of course, what happens next will largely be determined by Sarah Catt herself.If she has any hope of eliciting even a shred of sympathy from the court, she must open up about what on earth drove her to such an act of desperation.For now, however, she remains obstinately tight-lipped, refusing to tell anyone why she decided to end her unborn baby’s life and, more importantly, where that infant is now.

There is a lot more to this story than we are being told. That makes the comments of "RIP, little one" and "how could she kill her baby", etc not very nice. There is no proof that the baby is dead. And until there is, this woman doesn't deserve to be called a murderer. There also seems to be no proof that she had an affair other than the in-laws questioning her fidelity. They don't state if they have any reason to do this. Just because her husband works away sometimes doesn't mean she is playing away. For me, I'll reserve judgement on the whole sad story until we actually know, if we ever do, what happened.

Maybe I'm too open minded. But I don't think anyone has the right to judge this woman or any other woman as they haven't been in her place. This is a personal, unnusual case and this article is probably showing only one of many sides to it.

I have read this article twice, and i am still surprised by the top comments. No amount of internal struggle justifies in my eyes what she has done. She gets no understanding (as some people are saying we should be offering her) from me. She has done a very evil thing. She has killed her child. And yes, i WILL judge her for that. I'm not living in a glass house because i've never killed anyone. Send her to jail. I could cry for that poor baby.- Summa, London, london, 28/7/2012 13:16______________________ I totally agree with you, Summa. Nothing justifies her actions, she should be held in an interrogation room until she tells what happened. She may as well have let the child be born and then killed him/her, it would be no worse than what she has done. Poor little mite. RIP.

"God. She must have been in a terrible place to do something so awful. Nobody knows the full story. So until then let's not get the knives out.- jenny, Dublin, 28/7/2012 03:16" - thats strange. I had a look at the story on the guy who massacred the people in a cinema in the states, and you didnt make this same comment. Why is that? Or is it OK to reserve judgement because its a mother who killed her baby, so thats OK then.
- Dave Sampson, London, UK , 28/7/2012 9:03 silly man - that's because they don't print every comment sent!

So when how and when did she go into labour and dispose of the child with no-one finding out about it - and who was looking after her other children? How could she go through that and behave normally?

Perhaps she had a very good reason and the rest of her family at least do not need or deserve the intrusion of a modern day witch hunt of the sanctimonious self righteous.

Winterwatch star Chris Packham mentioned 22 Madness singles
Wildlife expert Chris Packham has gone 'One Step Beyond' other TV presenters by sneaking in 22 Madness song titles - into his BBC show Winterwatch.Chris, 51, secretly slipped the legendary 80s pop band's hit singles into the programme - even making up fictitious relatives on live television as part of the ruse.He surreptitiously mentioned a total of 22 songs by the group on the four-part nightly BBC2 series this week.Packham gave his first hint what he was up to with his introduction to Monday's opening show when he announced he was wearing "Baggy Trousers", one of Madness's most successful records.Discussing the best places to spot rare breeds of bird on Wednesday he said: "My Uncle Sam, he lives in NW5," name-checking two lesser-known singles - Uncle Sam and NW5 - in one sentence.And in the same episode, sly Chris managed to mention "Tarzan's Nuts", the band's most obscure number, which was released only in the Netherlands, by saying: "These squirrels out there swinging in the trees like little Tarzans. Nuts is what they're after." More...

The man accused of going on a deadly rampage apparently targeting TSA agents inside Los Angeles International Airport has been named as Paul Anthony Ciancia.A motive for the fatal shooting wasn't clear but Ciancia was wearing fatigues and carrying a bag containing a handwritten note that said he 'wanted to kill TSA and pigs' and that may have made a reference to a conspiracy theory about a totalitarian force trying to take over the world, according to a federal official who wished to remain anonymous. Friends and former classmates are now trying to connect the quiet young man who was sometimes the target of bullies, with the apparent anti-government attacker who opened fire and killed a TSA agent. Scroll down for video Identified: Paul Anthony Ciancia has been named as the gunman in the LAX airport shooting
Caught: Ciancia, who was shot in the head during a standoff with police, was handcuffed to a gurney'He kept to himself and ate lunch alone a lot,' said former classmate David Hamilton, who attended Salesianum School with Ciancia. 'I really don’t remember any one person who was close to him.... In four years, I never heard a word out of his mouth,' Hamilton told The Los Angeles Times. 'He was quiet and people would take advantage of that.' Welfare check: Officers visited Ciancia's apartment after his father raised concernsAnother former classmate; Jeff Skidmore, said that Ciancia may have had a speech
impediment and did not like speaking in front of the class. Skidmore told the paper that he did not remember Ciancia ever being bullied, saying instead that he was just left alone by his peers. A different federal official said that it was clear from the note that he expected to die in the standoff. 'This was clearly a suicide mission... he did not expect to walk away from this,' the official told USA Today.The 23-year-old gunman is said to have has strong anti-government views and sent a text to his brother this morning saying he was thinking about taking his own life. CNN reports
that his text to his brother was not the first one that he had sent in recent days that scared family members. In others, which were sent to his brother and father, Ciancia was said to have rambled about his negative outlook on life, his disgust with the government and his disappointment with his life in Los Angeles. Relatives
were concerned about the latest suicidal text, so they contacted the local New Jersey police station, who called their Los Angeles counterparts and ordered a 'welfare check' for Ciancia. Police went to his apartment and spoke to his two roommates before signing off and telling the New Jersey police that everything was fine. Little did they know that as they were making that phone call, Ciancia had started shooting at LAX.Ciancia,
an American citizen with a minor criminal record, was arrested after an
armed confrontation with police and taken to a hospital, where he is listed in critical condition after reportedly being shot in the face. More...

The gunman, who was raised in Pennsville, New Jersey, is accused of shooting dead
a safety screener with a high-powered assault rifle and wounding several others before being apprehended by police, according to officials. He was pictured handcuffed to a gurney as he was escorted out of the airport after being shot multiple times by responding officers. FBI names LAX gunman as 23-year-old Paul Anthony Ciancia
Investigation: Police gather at the New Jersey home of Ciancia's father
According to ABC, Ciancia's brother received a 'worrying' text from him before the
shooting, which prompted their father to call the police station to warn them of the possible threat to his own life. Los
Angeles police went to Ciancia's apartment for a welfare check, and spoke to the 23-year-old's roommates, who said when they last saw him on
Thursday he had been fine. Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday
The
officers reported back to headquarters that there was nothing to be worried about but, unbeknown to them, as they made that call Ciancia had
already opened fire in LAX.There was one fatality in the shooting: Gerardo I. Hernandez, a 39-year-old father-of-two who had been working at Los Angeles International Airport for three years. Friends and family have begun paying their respects to the slain public servant, saying that he was a loving husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his children. The
shooting makes Hernandez the first TSA agent shot and killed in the line of duty. One of his colleagues was also shot in the Friday rampage but that individual is expected to make a full recovery. NBC's
Pete Williams reported that the 23-year-old suspect may have anti-government views based on the literature he was carrying. A neighbor of Ciancia's, Whitney Hankins, 18, who went to Pennsville
Memorial High School with him, said the family were very quiet and kept to
themselves, especially after the 2009 death of the mother Susan, who suffered
from MS for years.
‘I didn’t know him personally as he was a few years older
than me,’ she said. ‘But I would see him around school and the neighborhood. Warning signs: Ciancia sent a text message to his brother on Friday morning saying he wanted to kill himself Loner: Neighbors of Ciancia say the 23-year-old was quiet and shy
'He was kinda strange, very quiet and shy. Wouldn’t really make eye contact or
talk much. Though I would never have expected him to do anything like this.
Some of the girls on the street called him “the creepy guy”.’
ANTI-GOVERNMENT LEANINGSThe motive for the Friday morning shooting has not been confirmed, but a note thought to be written by the
gunman is shedding some light on his thought process. Shooter
Paul Anthony Ciancia had 'anti-government' leanings and was reportedly carrying a note which said that he 'wanted to kill TSA and pigs'. The
Los Angeles Times reported that in a note found in his bag, he wrote about his 'disappointment with government' and how he did not intend to injure any civilians, only federal employees. Sources also added that the note was signed with the letters 'NWO' which stands for 'New World Order'. The
conspiracy theory of a 'new world order' asserts that there is a secret
group of powerful individuals who used their money and global influence
to eventually gain control of the world. The
concept of the New World Order has many different strains that have evolved over time, and has come to include mysterious elite groups like the Illuminati and the Freemasons. Some
of the more radical conspiracy theorists believe that the secret members of the New World Order will order a coordinated coup d'etat in the United States and other powerful countries using black helicopters and implement a totalitarian regime to control the world. Whitney said in the tight-knit middle-class neighborhood,
the Ciancia’s house was set back into the woods and was ‘humungous’ compared to
others on the street.‘We just assumed they were really wealthy because they have
a really big house compared to the others and his dad owns an auto shop up the
street. 'It’s a really small town and everyone knows everyone else’s business.
But everyone just kind of left them alone after the mom died.’The Pennsville Police Department has had no dealings with the younger Ciancia, Cummings said. He and neighbors described the Ciancias as a good, nice family.Ciancia graduated in 2008 from Salesianum School, an all-boys Roman Catholic school in Wilmington, Delaware, across the Delaware River from Pennsville, the school said.The suspect's father has been involved with Pennsville's Fraternal Order of Police, said neighbor Orlando Pagan, a lieutenant in nearby Penns Grove. He didn't provide details on his involvement.Outside the father's home Friday in Pennsville, a police cruiser blocked the long driveway. Phone calls weren't answered, and efforts to reach siblings were also unsuccessful.Orlando Pagan's 17-year-old son Josh said that he would sometimes encounter Ciancia at orthodontist appointments, but that it had been at least two years since the last one.'He was never weird toward me. He never gave me any weird vibes,' he said, adding that in the 10 years he has lived across the street from the Ciancia family, 'they've been nothing but nice to us.'Witness
Leon Saryan told ABC News Radio that a ‘fairly young’ man armed with a rifle fired about 20 rounds as he made his way down a hallway before confronting a TSA agent. Stranger: Some girls on the street where Ciancia grew up referred to him as 'the creepy guy'
The screener, who was holding Saryan's shoes, was shot and wounded, he told ABC. More...

The witness recalled that the suspect faced him and asked, ‘Are you TSA?’‘He saw me. He looked at me with a quizzical look and said, “TSA?” And I just shook my head. So he moved on,’ Saryan said. FBI agents and LAPD anti-terrorism officials were on the scene at Terminal 3, but sources said they do not believe the suspect was connected to any known terrorist groups, calling
him a lone shooter. LAX Police Chief Patrick Gannon told reporters that the gunman entered Terminal 3 at 9.20am local time, pulled an assault rifle out of his bag and opened fire. He shot his way through the safety screening area and moved deeper into the terminal. Officers who responded to reports of shots fired tracked the man to a Burger King and shot him.

Paranoid schizophrenia is what Obama needs to eradicate - this disease ruins lives. Sadly, its not the person's fault who has this illness, but it destroys lives. Guns need to go - yes, but the problem is this overlooked disease that is responsible for all of these tragedies.
