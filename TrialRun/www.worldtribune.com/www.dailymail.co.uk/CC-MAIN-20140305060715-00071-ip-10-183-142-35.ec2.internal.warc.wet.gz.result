The Pill ruined the institution of marriage, says Raquel Welch

Raquel Welch has blamed the Pill for the decline of the institution of marriage. The Hollywood actress said the widespread use of oral contraceptives had led to a breakdown in sexual morality and fuelled the growth of rampant promiscuity among the young. Miss Welch, 69, said the situation has grown so grave that 'these days nobody seems able to keep it in their pants or honour a commitment'. Sex symbol: Raquel Welch now aged 69, was voted by readers of Playboy magazine as 'the most desired female of the 1970s'. But she warns that the Pill has created social anarchyWhile she argued that it carried some benefits, she said the enduring legacy of the Pill has been social anarchy. Miss Welch has been a sex symbol since she sprang to international fame for her role in the 1966 film One Million Years BC - and was voted by readers of Playboy magazine as 'the most desired female of the 1970s'. But in an article to mark the introduction of the Pill to the U.S. market 50 years ago, she distanced herself from the fruits of the sexual revolution of which she was a part. Cave woman: Welch in the 1966 film One Million Years BC which earned her international fame
'The growing proliferation of birth control methods has had an awesome effect on both sexes and led to a sea change in moral values,' she said in an article for television channel CNN entitled 'It's SexO'Clock in America'. A positive consequence of the Pill was it had 'made it easier for a woman to choose to delay having children until after she established herself in a career', she said. Breakdown: Welch said the growing proliferation of birth control methods has led to a change in moral values (Posed by model)
Miss Welch, who has three failed marriages behind her, added that a 'significant and enduring' effect on women was the idea that they could have sex without any consequences - with the result that fewer today saw marriage as a 'viable option'. She went on: 'Seriously, folks, if an ageing sex symbol like me starts waving the red flag of caution over how low moral standards have plummeted, you know it's gotta be pretty bad.' Miss Welch married high school sweetheart James Welch in 1959 at the age of 18 - whom she divorced five years later. She kept quiet about the couple's two children, were Damon (born in 1960) and Tahnee (born in 1961, as she tried to launch
her career.Arriving
in LA during the 'beach party craze' of the early 60s, she landed minor
roles in films such as Elvis Presley's Roustabout (1964) and A Swingin'
Summer (1965) before being catapulted to stardom with One Million Years
B.C. in 1966.The film star, who was linked to a string of men in her heyday -
including Elvis Presley, Dean Martin and Burt Bacharach - said she would
urge women to feel comfortable with growing old.'I want them to stop being scared of it, because it's just another chapter in life,' she said on the Oprah Winfrey show.'I want to encourage them not to be disturbed and to really embrace it and go with it.'

Foxglow said "Just because I don't want a family, does not mean that I am less of a woman, thank you. ...I thank God for the pill. It allows me to remain child free."
and I thank God you will soon be EXTINCT! Live your life for all it matters, not one single person will know you ever existed a hundred years from now, about the time when my great-grandchildren will be running the world.

"The whole concept of people attaching "morality" of any kind to the entirely biological act of sex is the real problem."
do you mean to say that we are just animals with nothing beyond biological instincts? that we have no higher reasoning capacities, no ability to discern right and wrong, nothing to distinguish us from dogs and birds and snakes?
how dreadful!

She isn't saying that she thinks we'd be better off without the pill, just that it's had some unintended consequences. In fact, I think that rather than young WOMEN feeling they don't need to marry or settle down, it's actually meant that men feel they don't need to. Now that men can have sex without having to get married, as far as they are concerned there's less incentive to settle down/get married/raise a family etc. This HAS had a destabilising effect on our society - anyone can see this. The norm now is NOT to get married rather than to get married as things were 2 generations ago.
However, whether women would want to go back to life pre-pill is quite another matter, as it involves so many other questions e.g. career, financial stability etc.

The whole concept of people attaching "morality" of any kind to the entirely biological act of sex is the real problem.
Male or female, sleeping with someone is not an evil or bad thing. Jesus, put the Bible away, kids and move into the current century.
- Frank Wallace, Glasgow, Scotland, 11/5/2010 18:03
Why did this comment get red-arrowed? He's totally right. Why is sex made to be this big, sacred thing? It's completely natural, and if people want to sleep around that's their business. Also, blaming the pill is stupid. People had sex before contraception was invented, and what has it got to do with marriage anyway?

Frighteningly easy divorce is just as much to blame as the pill. Family life in the West has been irrecoverably shattered - there are few examples, reasons or morals left in place to foster respect, loyalty and commitment.
People simply don't care who or what they destroy in their pursuit of hedonism.

Ian Martin - why do you equate 'real' women with mothers and wives? I have no desire for marriage or children. Just because I don't want a family, does not mean that I am less of a woman, thank you. And from your post, you clearly don't have a clue about what feminism is either!
I thank God for the pill. It allows me to remain child free.

I NEVER thought I'd agree with a hollywood "sex symbol" but I agree. Honor has become a thing of the past. And I believe it is mostly due to the socialist/Marxist communist movement to relativistic values and acceptance of individual moral deviance in the "name" of tolerance. Of course, tolerance doesn't apply to those who adhere to Christian values and morals.

Mon of London you are right.
Now men how about you too take responsibility and use a contraceptive pill too?
Tis stupid - morals have always been broken.
come on! the child brides are a good example of marriage... yeah and let not forget this was rampant in one time or another in EVERY 'dark aged' religion and or culture.
And hold the phone the pill may be the only thing saving some young lass out there from being pregnant by her incestuous father or brother or uncle... whatever.
Come on think this through girls.
This is dark aged thinking - there is a break down in social morals lets find something abot females we can blame it on. >,> sheeeesh! Uh no... you know its more than just one small thing like the pill.

It is feminism that is the root cause of the weakening of marriage, feminism is an institution of hate that is bent on the destruction of families. It is their main aim that they think is at the heart of the "patriarchy". It has been replaced with a matriarchical underclass and men who have been traumatised by terrible laws which demonise them in many ways
Where are the REAL women who put families at the heart of their lives, why have a few extremists full of hate and NO interest in the gene pool, been allowed to do all this ? Why is the press ignoring what is happpening to fathers ?

My parents didn't rely on my school to teach me about sex, they made she I knew everything. My mother was very open and taught me self worth. Due to this I lost interest and waited until I was 18. I'm now 21, engaged and buying a home. I've only been with my fiance. I use the pill as I want to be married before I have children.
Besides the people I know who sleep around have multiple children anyway, so clearly the pill has nothing to do with it.

Clearly they gave awards to any 'celeb' who could turn up on the night. Jessie J best solo artist?! Seriously?! Glamour just create awards to give Fearne and Holly every single year. Although I like Holly as a presenter, Fearne winning best radio DJ is a joke. 0

Fearne Cotton, best Radio Personality............really, I mean really. I may be 40+ but I still listen to Radio 1 and I think she is cringeworthy. The breadth of her knowledge is about as wide as a paddling pool and she always has her producer to fill in the fact gaps. 4

Im puzzled as to why eva longoria won an award for being "inspirational" after just reading the story about the lady diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer... Why not honour her, why do the women honoured have to be famous when there are fare more deserving ladies
