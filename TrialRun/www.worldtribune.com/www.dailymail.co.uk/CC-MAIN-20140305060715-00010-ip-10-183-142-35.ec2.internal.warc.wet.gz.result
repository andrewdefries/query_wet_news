Kanye West flies into a fit of rage after he and Kim Kardashian nearly bump into her ex-boyfriend Reggie Bush By

It was no doubt an awkward moment for all involved when Kim Kardashian and Kanye West nearly bumped into the reality star's ex-boyfriend Reggie Bush on Sunday night. But it appears that the footballer's close presence while the couple were dining at upscale steak house Prime 112 in Miami, left Kim's rapper beau's blood boiling. Rage: Kanye West flew into a fit of rage after he and his girlfriend had a near awkward encounter with Kim's ex-boyfriend Reggie Bush in Miami on Sunday night The
35-year-old flew into a fit of rage when a camerawoman outside of the eatery asked the singer if he congratulated Bush, who is about to become
a father for the first time. Clenching his teeth, The Touch The Sky star walked right up to woman and grabbed her camera.Meanwhile, Kim was seen at his side with a forced smile plastered across her face. The brunette star appeared to be trying to calm Kanye, holding onto his arm. Backing down, the couple finally left the restaurant and sped off into the night in Kanye's flash car. On the edge: The rapper got angry when a camerawoman asked him whether he congratulated Reggie about becoming a father for the first time
It's hardly surprising that Kanye was rattled following the chance encounter with Kim's ex. Kim and Reggie dated on and off for two years and came close to marriage. Kim and Reggie are both currently in Miami, and just narrowly avoided meeting as they chose neighbouring restaurants to eat dinner on Sunday night. Not happy: Clenching his teeth, The Touch The Sky star walked right up to woman to confront her
A source said: 'Kim and Kanye arrived
to Prime 112 for dinner at about the same time Reggie Bush and Lilit arrived for dinner across the street at Prime Italian.'While Reggie plays for the Miami Dolphins, Kim is in town to film her new reality show.Kim
is said to have been upset by this week's news that her onetime love is
expecting his first child with current girlfriend Lilit Avagyan, 25. That was close! Kim and Kanye head home from a romantic dinner in Miami's South Beach... narrowly avoiding Reggie Bush who was eating nearby
Near miss: Dining across the street was Miami Dolphins star Reggie Bush and his pregnant girlfriend Lilit Avagyan
And as with her new beau Kanye on her arm it would have been a particularly awkward encounter.Luckily the two couples timed their exits differently, managing to avoid any stilted small talk.At least Kim could have consoled herself that she was looking her best. While her revealing outfit of a bikini style cut out top and transparent skirt may not be to everyone's taste, it certainly showed Reggie what he was missing. Expecting: It is early days for dancer Lilit, who showed no hint of a bump
This week saw the Miami Dolphins star, 27, announce his happy news.'I have a little one on the way,' he told Florida's Paul and Young Ron Morning Show. 'We're pretty excited... It's an opportunity to bring in new life and raise a child.' Reggie, 27, has been dating professional dancer Lili for a year. She shares his ex-girlfriend Kim's Armenian heritage and has been described as a 'lookalike'. Kim is reportedly upset by the news that her ex is to become a father. Showing off those famous curves: If the two couples had met, at least Kim would have been dressed to kill
A source told RadarOnline: 'Kim is very upset. Kim had pressured Reggie for a very long time to get married while they were together because she wanted to have a family with him. 'Reggie just thought that Kim placed too much of a priority on her fame and reality television though and he wanted none of it. 'Reggie was a part of the Kardashian family for over five years and deep down Kim has always held out hope that they would end up together, even though she married Kris Humphries.' The insider said it felt like 'a slap in the face' to Kim that Reggie would consider having a baby with another woman when he wouldn't with her. Near miss: The two restaurants neighbour one another; Kanye's car can be seen outside

'Flew into a fit of rage' is somewhat of an exaggeration. The question posed was purely designed to antagonize in order to elicit a strong reaction. Kanye West, all things considered, acted with admirable restraint. 4

"The 35-year-old flew into a fit of rage when a camerawoman outside of the eatery asked the singer if he congratulated Bush, who is about to become a father for the first time. Clenching his teeth, The Touch The Sky star walked right up to woman and grabbed her camera." Kim, if this isn't a warning sign to get the hell out of dodge. I don't know what is. The look in Kanye's eyes in pictures 2 and 3 is not good. It's like a red mist and is directed at a woman. You will be deluding yourself if you think Kanye is somehow 'protecting' your honour. He is a thug pure and simple.

His long dreadlocks have formed a key part of his image.But Glee's Samuel Larsen has taken the brave step of cutting it all off. The 21-year-old devoted Christian revealed the dramatic change in a before and after series of photos, first showing him with his long hair and then without, taken last Thursday in West Hollywood, California. Scroll down for video Big change: Glee's Samuel Larsen models the before and after of his dramatic haircut in a series of photos shot on May 23 in West Hollywood, California The San Francisco-born actor wears only jeans in the photo shoot, showing off his impressive physique. Glee star Samuel Larson shows off new chop on Vine with wine
In the before picture, Samuel wears his signature dreadlocks over one shoulder as he stares intently at the camera.He gets playful in another shot, holding the ropes of hair in the air with his hands as he smiles while looking skywards. Sick of it: The 21-year-old has been wanting to cut off his dreadlocks for years, saying in 2011, 'It was up to me I would have cut my hair a long time ago' Like what you see: The star looked at the camera with a cheeky half-smile as he leaned forward on his fist Look what I can do! The devoted Christian playfully held his ropes of hair in the air as he smiled while looking skywards Samuel, who plays Christian character Joe Hart in the hit Fox show, looks like a different man in the after pictures, showing the singer with short, thick black hair.He wears geek chic reading glasses as he seductively plays with his belt while wearing what looks like a shark's tooth around his neck.In both the before and after series, Samuel shows off his nose ring and numerous tattoos, including the phrase, 'I will love thee O Lord My strength' from Psalm 18 in the Bible. It's getting hot in here: Samuel looked sexier than ever with his new short do as he played seductively with his belt Geek chic: He wore tortoiseshell reading glasses, which only added to his allure Samuel clearly felt freer after cutting off all his hair, tweeting last Thursday:'Just for the record my neck feels freakin awesome okay.

'I called my agent a year ago telling her I wanted to cut my hair because I thought it limited me too much. I wanted to try to get more mainstream roles, and she talked me out of it. I guess that [Glee co-creator] Ryan [Murphy] liked it and I'm okay with that, but I do look at keeping my hair as more of a burden.'He landed the part in the series after winning the The Glee Project season one along with with Damian McGinty.He had previously auditioned for American Idol in 2010 and made it to Hollywood Week before being cut.

I hate tattoos, so trashy. I would never date a guy with tattoos and I don't see how men think they are the least bit attractive on a woman. To me it shows a lack of discipline to not follow the crowd and deface your body. Just a follower of any trend even if it looks horrid. An awful fad. Time for it to be over. No one gets them anymore except the clueless or trailer park trash. Hard to tell the difference these days though.
