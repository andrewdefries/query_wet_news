Amanda Holden towering in heels despite being weeks from giving birth
They are a biological wonder, carrying your entire body weight for up to 10,000 steps a day without complaint. They contain a quarter of the bones in your body and are vital for balance and mobility — so why do we treat our feet so badly? Eighty per cent of British women suffer problems with their feet, according to the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, while one in five men suffers foot pain most days — and experts say many of these problems are down to a lack of basic footcare and terrible choice in shoes.Just this week actress Amanda Holden was spotted in towering heels despite being weeks from giving birth.Scientists at the University of East Anglia recently warned that high heels could be to blame for flat feet, a painful condition affecting around 15 per cent of people. It appears sky-high shoes weaken tendons in feet, causing the arches to fall and leading to painful soles and postural problems. Professor Alan Silman of Arthritis Research UK, which funded the research, said: ‘Foot problems are an important and not sufficiently recognised cause of pain and disability in the elderly. 'This research represents a first step to unravelling some of the complex biochemistry that regulates tendon disorders.’Uncomfortable footwear can lead to a range of problems from back pain to osteoporosis and even migraines — yet just 19 per cent of us actually seek treatment.

If you're going to have an operation, make sure it's in March: How the passing months affect your health
The agonising pain women endure for EIGHT YEARS before they are diagnosed
It’s what Mike O’Neill, of the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, calls Ostrich Syndrome. ‘People don’t like their feet — they consider them the ugliest part of the body, so they don’t pay any attention to what’s going on down there.’ And they will pay the price of this neglect, adds Andy Goldberg, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS in London. ‘Problems can build for a long time before they really hurt. So people put up with it until the problem becomes permanent.’Here, the experts reveal the worst crimes against feet — and offer simple tips to keep our long-suffering trotters in good health.NOT OWNING ENOUGH SHOES Your feet produce an eggcup of sweat each day
Your feet produce an eggcup of sweat each day, so if you wear the same shoes day in, day out, they’ll never have time to dry out, raising the risk of fungal infections such as athlete’s foot. ‘Damp skin is more prone to infection because fungi grow most easily in warm, wet conditions,’ says Chris Walker, consultant orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon at Liverpool’s Bone and Joint Centre. ‘It takes 12 to 18 hours for shoes to dry out after you’ve worn them, so you should alternate your shoes each day. ‘Most women have a few pairs of shoes but men wear the same ones straight for six months,’ adds Mike O’Neill. ‘It’s equivalent to wearing the same underpants every day for six months and puts you at risk of fungal infections and smelly feet.’FOLLOWING FASHIONFoot binding was banned in China in 1912, but many experts wonder if anyone told the world’s shoe manufacturers — because fashionable footwear is leading to a multitude of health problems. ‘Shoewear design is in the dark ages,’ says surgeon Andy Goldberg. ‘A third of bunions are caused by shoes — we’ve become used to wearing pointed shoes and high heels.’ Up to one in ten of Britain’s 15 million sufferers are thought to be men, whose problems are often made worse by fashionable Italian shoes, which are so long and thin they squash the toes, adds Goldberg. But in the long term the effects of high heels can go way beyond bunions, says London osteopath John Durkin. ‘When you walk, the foot naturally rolls in so that when it hits the ground, it absorbs the shock. ‘High heels don’t allow for this, so the knees and back absorb the shock instead, which can lead to back pain as well as osteoarthritis in the knee and hip.’ Meanwhile, Dr Jane Andersen, of the American Podiatric Medical Association has warned: ‘The muscular tension that heels put on your back can also lead to migraines. But there aren't any studies proving this link.'
She says heels higher than 2in may throw the body out of alignment, putting strain on the back and causing neck and head pain.DIY PODIATRY ‘One of my biggest bugbears is what I call bathroom chiropody,’ says podiatrist Emma Supple. ‘People sit in the bath and carve a corn out of their own flesh, or dig out an ingrowing toenail with the nail scissors — it should always be done by a chiropodist to get rid of the problem for good.’ Surgeon Chris Walker even sees people who have used razor blades to remove calluses from the soles of their feet — dangerous because they cut too deep and can cause infection if the blade is not clean.Emma Supple also warns against metal devices — which look similar to a cheese grater — that have become popular for exfoliating hard skin. ‘Rubbing a metal object against the foot will inflame the tissue, causing pain in the area,’ she says. ‘A pumice stone would be better.’ FOOT PHOBIA Feet can provide important clues about our health
Feet can provide important clues about our health — persistent ulcers on the feet are often the first sign of diabetes, for example (high blood sugars mean they are less able to heal), while flat feet may mean you’re at raised risk of arthritis.But many of us are too afraid or disgusted to give them a once over, says Chris Walker. ‘You should check your feet for cuts or thickened skin, changes in colour or changes in the toenails, and look out for calluses in the soles, too — elderly people, pregnant women and anyone who can’t reach should use a mirror.’ Diabetics, in particular, should be vigilant, as they are at risk of neuropathy, a loss of sensation in the feet, and may not notice a dangerous cut or infection. BALLET PUMPS Flats cause the feet to roll inwards, taking the knees with them and changing gait, which can raise the risk of knee and back pain
‘People think they’re good for you because they are so flat, but ballet pumps are one of the worst shoes,’ says podiatrist Emma Supple.‘The lack of heel means there’s too much impact on the arch of the foot, over time causing a lot of midfoot pain and jamming the function of the big toe joint.’Flats also cause the feet to roll inwards, taking the knees with them and changing gait, which can raise the risk of knee and back pain.‘The heel is so flimsy that you end up clawing your toes to keep the shoe on,’ says Mike O’Neill. ‘This can damage the toe joint and the mechanics of the knee.’GOING TO THE GYMAthlete’s foot has reached ‘epidemic’ proportions in Britain as more and more of us go to the gym and use communal bathing areas, says Mike O’Neill. ‘Men are worse than women and what they often do is go to the gym, then leave their trainers in the back of the car where it’s warm and dark and a perfect breeding ground for any fungi they’ve picked up.’Athlete’s foot is characterised by flaking, itchy skin usually starting around the toes. ‘Often, people rub one itching foot against the other which spreads it into the toenails, turning them a yellowy-brown colour,’ warns O’Neill. If left untreated the condition can last for months. THE BIG SQUEEZEThree-quarters of us are thought to wear the wrong size shoes. This is partly because people stick to the size they were measured for when they were young, failing to realise that feet change shape. But a study in 2009 found that 37 per cent of women and 17 per cent of men buy shoes in the sales knowing they’re the wrong size. Squashing the toes into an ill-fitting shoe changes the alignment of the body as well as raising the risk of bunions and hammer toes. ‘You should have a finger’s width between the end of your toes and the shoe,’ says John Durkin. ‘But ladies don’t like their feet to look big, so they wear shoes too small for them.’ not going barefootStudies comparing European with African populations suggest that people who do not wear shoes have healthier feet and posture.Andy Goldberg says everyone should spend at least an hour a day walking barefoot.‘When foot muscles are inside tight shoes we don’t use them properly. You should be able to pick up a 10p piece with your toes, but I doubt most people can.’Slippers are a good alternative, says podiatrist Emma Supple, but be sure to wash them. ‘A lot of people wear slippers for years without washing or changing them. What on earth could be growing in that sheepskin?’MIXING HEELS AND DRINK 'Women are falling off 6, 7, even 8in heels and the ankle breaks,' said surgeon Chris Walker
Millions of us watched the stars of Sex And The City sipping coolly at their martinis in towering heels. But Chris Walker says alcohol and heels make for a lethal cocktail.‘Maybe 20 years ago if you got drunk and fell off a 4in heel you’d be OK — perhaps a ligament injury or fracture. 'Now women are falling off 6, 7, even 8in heels and the ankle breaks.'It’s awful to see because these patients are often young, and come to me with no idea that they will never run again. You never get over a break like that.’ Share or comment on this article

If you can find it, try Tamaris or Jana shoes with Anti-Shock. They are a miracle and look cute. The heel is quite modest, but it has a nice shape. Everybody admires mine, my girlfriends say these shoes look very elegant on me. 0

I've had ankle pain for about 4 years & been backwards and forwards to the doctors. Finally one told me my flat sensible shoes were to blame (and no, they're not ballet pumps, they're sensible wide fitting velcro-fixed shoes). He told me to go out and buy some well sprung trainers or crocs, and gave me a prescription for painkillers. On the way home I passed Millets, who were having a sale of walking boots, so I bought a couple of pairs, and now wear Crocs as slippers (he said to stop going barefoot indoors). In the next two weeks I think I took 3 painkillers, instead of the 14 he had told me to take. I just didn't need them! Although I've had some setbacks, I'm still mostly pain-free after two months. I can't believe the difference wearing the right shoes has made!

I love the look of ballet flats but have known for years that they didn't provide enough support to the heels and arches. My heels actually hurt after banging on the pavement in ballet flats! Recently, the ballet flat style has become available in relatively low wedges, which are much more comfortable and supportive. I don't know what podiatrists would think, but both my feet and fashion sense are thanking me.

I like to see articles like this. There are so many people that take their feet for granted. Unluckily I suffer from a foot condition which makes my knees swell and becase I was diagnosed so late (in my 20's) the problem will never fully go away and affects my life everyday. I hate to see girls that have perfectly normal feet with no problems wearing ill-fitting shoes and shoes which are bad for their feet and posture. I wish I could make them see what it is like to have the health of their feet taken away for even a few days and then they wouldn't abuse their bodies so badly. Unfortunately many will regret it in years to come. 0

It's TRUE that you pay the price in later life for wearing ill-fitting shoes for years! I never wore really high heels but now at 60 I have bunions. it can be very difficult now finding shoes that are comfortable and are reasonably fashionable! But styles are now more varied so I go for the round or almond toe shape. I have always found 'ballet' pumps almost impossible to wear. They are TOO flat and the uppers are cut so low that I can't keep them on!! 0

Susan Boyle is snubbed by the Brit Awards - because 'she isn't cool enough'
Author of reported comment:
Chris, Washington, DC

Comment ID:
788319
Comment:
Personally, I think her voice is brilliant and she is here to stay. One in a million.
Even if I did not think that, I would consider the economic reality of the industry. This decision is going to really hurt the ailing recording industry in the UK. A nomination need not be a win. If there were ever a time that the recording industry needed a lift, this is it.
SB had already so many broken records in ALL media before the album was released. And the vote for nominations was taken AFTER she broke a few more in the UK and US. For SB fans - it's one less show to watch and one less opportunity for the "cool" artists to win over Susan Boyle fans as customers. We are, after all, buying the CD's that keep the recording industry employed. Over 90% physical product.
Record industry execs and insiders must be insane or incompetent.

'You'll know when its right': What tragic country singer Mindy McCready told friend about releasing suicide awareness video before she shot herself Author of reported comment:
