I still find it strange that a civilisation that could predict the end of the world could not predict what was going to happen to them!

Microchips law 'won't stop dog attack menace': Critics say muzzling and training courses would better address dog attack problem

Even responsible dog owners seem to be under the impression their dogs are allowed to harrass others. Just because 'he doesn't bite' doesn't mean its okay for the animal to jump up, give chase or stick its nose where it isn't wanted. Neither children or adults are mind-readers and don't know 'he won't hurt you' when the owner is half-a-mile away, letting the dog do as it pleases. Muzzling or on a lead in all public spaces will put a stop to this. Your email address:

Female novelist sick of patronising covers on women's books asks fans to give classic literature a modern 'girly' makeoverMaureen Johnson claims publishers pigeonhole books by womenShe asked fans to 'coverflip' books like On The Road and Shutter IslandShe was inundated with classics with new 'girly' coversBy

A top novelist has asked her fans to redesign classic novels as if they were being marketed at women in protest at the 'girly' imagery publishers use on book covers for women authors.American writer Maureen Johnson claims publishers use fluffy imagery to market novels by women, so she asked her Twitter fans to 'coverflip' classics such as Jack Kerouac's On The Road and Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange as if they had female authors.She was amazed at the number designs sent in from readers sympathetic to her gripe. Coverflip: The disturbing A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess (left) is re-imagined as a book written by and intended for a woman (right)
Horror classic Carrie by Stephen King, which traditionally has disturbing images of the female protagonist on the cover, was reimagined with a smiling blonde in lipstick and soft pastel shades.The female version of fantasy masterwork A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, or Georgette R. Martin in this case, boasted a young adult-orientated pink and purple cover with a pretty Daenerys Stormborn and a cute child wielding a sword.Dennis/Denise Lehane's Shutter Island, a stark psychological drama, now has a beautiful ocean view on the cover and is subtitled: 'A novel of self-discovery'. Not quite as scary: Stephen King's horror masterpiece is wildly different in its new female-friendly incarnation
Many women writers feel their work is lumbered with patronising covers by publishers
Ms Johnson, the author of the Shades of London and the Suite Scarlett series, said: 'I do wish I had a dime for every email I get that says: "Please put a non-girly cover on your book so I can read it – signed, A Guy".' More...
How sexist advertising causes men to adopt 'violent and sexually aggressive behavior' as they aspire to the macho ideal
Demands to shut down high school hotness tournament 'May Madness' where girls are encouraged to look their finest to win
Cambridge University drinking society cancels its annual jelly-wrestling contest after complaints from feminist students
She even used one of her own covers as an example. The cover of Key to the Golden Firebird shows a neon pink background, an image of a beautiful teenage girl displaying her midriff, and features the words 'a novel' in a dark pink heart. She told The Guardian: 'It's about three sisters who are dealing with the sudden death of their father. May, the middle sister, is trying to hold her family together and learn how to drive. This is the cover.' Gender reassignment: Even Maureen Johnson's own young adult novel 13 Little Blue Envelopes is changed into how it may look as written by a man
From sinister to silly: Crime writer Harlan Coben becomes Helen Coben
She added: 'The simple fact of the matter is, if you are a female author, you are much more likely to get the package that suggests the book is of a lower perceived quality because it's "girly", which is somehow inherently different and easier on the palate.'A man and a woman can write books about the same subject matter, at the same level of quality, and that woman is simply more likely to get the soft-sell cover with the warm glow and the feeling of smooth jazz blowing off of it.' It's Kind of a Funny Story (left) deals with controversial themes like teenage depression and suicide, but you wouldn't know it from the new female version
Amanda Hocking, the million-selling self-published novelist, blogged about the 'gender cover-up'.She said: 'More women read books than men, more women write books then men, but only a small fraction of books that win literary awards are written by women.'Women are the publishing industry's bread and butter, we are the backbone of the damn entertainment industry, but we are constantly demoted to "fluffy" to "light" to "meaningless".''I'm sick to death of this. I am so sick of the constant, blatant sexism. And any time any one points anything out as being sexist, they're accused of "whining" or "nagging" or "not taking a joke".'British author Polly Courtney went so far as to drop her publisher after her third book, It's a Man's World, was given the tagline 'but it takes a woman to run it'. Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas loses the pretty model for a distinctly more gender-neutral design
Maureen Johnson says she receives messages from male fans who don't feel comfortable reading her books because of the 'girly' nature of the cover
Reception: It's hard to imagine the reviewers who gave Jonathan Franzen's Freedom (left) glowing reviews would praise the book on the right quite as highly

She's known to favour generously-sized underwear.But Nicki Minaj took her preference for large lingerie a step further this evening.The star took to the stage at London's Wireless festival in Hyde Park wearing what can only be described as old-fashioned bloomers. No danger of flashing: Nicki Minaj wore some sizable bloomers to perform at London's Wireless this evening Psychedelic: Nicki teamed her bloomers with a mini skirt, gold knee-high boots, patterned tights and a florescent jacket
Thankfully that was not the extent of her outfit, and she teamed the underwear with a white and pink mini skirt with short black petticoats, psychedelic tights, and gold knee-high boots. More...

She added: 'Now I'm gonna take a big dose of Nyquil. :/'Nicki appeared a little more positive once on site, and tweeted: 'Yoooooo the WIRELESS crowd is LIVE to the billionth power!!!!! WOW. I'm in the ukaaayyyyyyy!!!!!!!'After her set she posted: 'The WIRELESS crowd was really exceptional. 65K people just enjoying life and exuding love. So glad I could be a part of it. ‪#IlovetheUK' Tricks of the trade: NIcki doesed up on Nyquil before her performance
She was accompanied on stage by dancers wearing silver, and despite being poorly gave as much energy as ever.Nicki was watched by stars including Mark Wright, who was pictured looking in high spirits in the crowd. Performed next: Drake took to the stage for his set after Nicki Crowd went wild: The audience raised their mobiles in salute to the singer

He found himself the unwilling participant in a fracas between Lindsay Lohan and Florida psychic Tiffany Eve Mitchell at a Manhattan nightclub on Wednesday night - which led to Lohan's arrest. But a smiling Max George didn't look too bothered by the star's fate, or all the attention surrounding him as he returned to his hotel after performing at New York's Madison Square Garden on Thursday. The Wanted singer planted a kiss on one waiting lady, and wrapped his arms around her as he posed for a picture on her camera phone Scroll down for video... Sealed with a kiss: Max George from The Wanted plants a kiss on a fan as he returned to his hotel after a second night of performing at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night Wearing a casual black hoodie and black trousers, Max smiled as he hugged another fan holding a camera.Max and British The Wanted had just been supporting Justin Bieber for the second night.On stage, the diminutive star made no mention of Wednesday night's fracas, but posted on his Twitter: 'Eventful night.'Max split from his fiancée, British soap star Michelle Keegan in August and a
band source told MailOnline; 'Max is a single guy, he is flirtatious, and a lot of women find him attractive. He's free to play around.' Hugging it out: Max embraced the fan before posing with her for a photograph on her phone Pleased to meet you: Max half hugs another enthusiastic fan who waves a camera around After the concert, Lohan, 26, and a friend joined Max and his bandmates Jay McGuiness and Tom Parker at the club.
Apparently a fight broke out near where a riled Lohan, a very drunk Max and the Tiffany Eve Mitchell and her husband were partying - and it is not yet clear how it involved The Wanted singer. Police sources said Mitchell claimed the actress knocked her to the ground with a strong blow to the left side of her face,with sources saying Mitchell 'suffered swelling and substantial pain to the face,' but refused medical attention, even though an ambulance was called.Police
were called, and Mitchell identified Lohan as her attacker. Most Wanted: Max seemed in good spirits as he returned to his hotel on Thursday night Fun night? Max George tweets following Lindsay Lohan's arrest
Feeling blue: Max was spotted leaving his New York hotel in Friday
The actress had already left the venue but police later intercepted a car in which she was passenger and made the arrest.
As she was led away in handcuffs, the star is believed to have yelled: 'Oh my God! I didn't touch anyone!'
She kept repeating: 'Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?'
Lohan was later taken to the 10th Precinct Station House in Manhattan, where she was accused of misdemeanor assault. She received a desk appearance ticket and will have to appear in court on January 7. She was described as being 'visibly tired'.
Under cover: The star was seen emerging from a nearby police station with a coat over her head later in the day I'm only here for Max: Fans tweet pictures of Lindsay Lohan at Justin Bieber's concert on Wednesday night The actress's day got worse when California prosecutors filed charges against her over a car crash on the Pacific Coast Highway in June, in which she rammed her Porsche into the back of a dump truck while on her way to the set of her TV movie Liz & Dick.
The
flame-haired star allegedly lied to police, telling them she was the passenger in the car, when, in fact, she was the driver.
The
three charges are obstructing or resisting a police officer, providing false information to a police officer, and reckless driving. According
to reports, Lohan told officers that her assistant Gavin Doyle had been
behind the wheel. But Santa Monica police said in a statement: 'During the subsequent investigation, information was developed that Lohan was the driver of the Porsche when the accident occurred.'
The legal implications for Lohan are more serious because she was probation at the time of the June 8 crash.
Latest trouble: Lohan has reportedly been arrested after getting
into a physical altercation with a female patron in a New York City nightclub on Wednesday evening VIDEO: Lindsay Lohan arrested outside NYC nightclub	Share or comment on this article
