Sooo predictable and childish that the first thing that comes to mind about this article is "The Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies"...... Actually, to be honest, that's the first thing that sprung to my mind too ^^ Totally looooved that production! 'Sides, I think the bust (statue) is quite cool and keeping up with the times. Women are indeed becoming larger chested, earlier, as time passes.

Police on drugs bust uncover 24 stolen tombstones in backyard

Comment:
What possible use could they have for the tombstones? They can't be sold for any amount of money -- they're already engraved. There's not much metal to make it worthwhile selling for scrap. The only thing they have would be blank slabs (once they remove engraved plaques). Are blank slabs in demand?
It's disgusting they've desecrated those graves and caused pain to families and friends! What could the families possibly have done to make them targets of these thieves?

It seems that these two can never be single...there is more to life then consistently being in a relationship...Taylor Swift really needs to slow down with the relationships and just focus on her singing...cause all she is getting known for now is who she is dating....she can do so much better then him...he's awful

A U.S. academic has been gang raped in Papua New Guinea by nine armed men who hacked off her blonde hair and left her husband tied naked to a tree.The 32-year-old woman, who was conducting research into exotic birds in a remote forest on Karkar Island, was walking along a bush track with her husband and a guide on Friday when they were set upon by the gang armed with knives and rifles.Her husband and the guide were stripped and bound by the men, who then used a bush knife to hack off the woman's hair before raping her in a terrifying ordeal lasting 20 minutes. 'Act of animals': The U.S. academic, 32, was with her husband and a guide when they were ambushed by nine men armed with rifles and knives - she was gang raped and her blonde hair hacked off
The woman chose to speak out about the horrific attack - condemned by the country's prime minister Peter O'Neil as 'the cowardly act of animals' - to highlight the violence that women in Papua New Guinea experience. More...

The brutal gang rape came less than a week after an Australian man living in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea was shot dead and his Filipina girlfriend gang raped when a group of men broke into their house.The U.S. woman, who posed for a photograph but did not want to reveal her identity, spoke to media in Port Moresby as she and her husband waited for a flight to leave the country.'I was walking along a bush track with my husband and our guide when we were ambushed by nine men armed with rifles and knifes,' she said.Relaying an ordeal that has sent shock waves throughout the country, the woman said the men first ordered her husband and the guide to strip naked before they were tried to trees.Then they turned to the woman.Her clothes were torn off, her hands were bound and her blonde hair was chopped off with bush knives. She was then raped one by one by the gang for a terrifying 20 minutes. Her ordeal ended only when something in the forest startled the gang and they ran away. The U.S. couple's guide managed to break free and released them, before they all ran naked along jungle tracks for several hours, determined to put as much distance as possible
between themselves and the scene of the attack in case the gang came back.Eventually they reached a remote village where they were given some clothing and from where they were able to raise the alarm. Violence: The woman, who was on her fifth visit to Papua New Guinea, was conducting research into exotic birds and climate change on the remote island off the country's northern coast
Remote: The 32-year-old academic was working on remote Karkar Island during her fifth trip to Papua New Guinea when she was attacked
They later made their way back to Madang, on the northern coast of the mainland, before flying to the capital Port Moreseby.A local photographer working for AFP helped the couple file police reports and organise a flight out of the country.'This
story should not come out just because I am white,' said the woman, who
was on her fifth visit to the country since her first trip in 2010. She
would stay for up to four months conducting her research into exotic birds and the impact of climate change on the forest.'My
story should come out in the hopes that it empowers Papua New Guinean women to stand up and say no more violence against women in this country,' said the woman, who did not want to reveal her identity.'I hope my story can make a change.'But senior police admit they have heard such calls before from tribal women all around Papua New Guinea.Wives suffer extreme violence in some cases from their husbands over domestic issues, and brutal punishments are handed out to women accused of witchcraft, which is practised in remote parts of the country.In February a 20-year-old mother accused of witchcraft was dragged from her village, taken to a rubbish dump, stripped and burned alive near Mount Hagen, in the centre of the country.And earlier this month an elderly woman was beheaded with a bush knife after being accused of sorcery. The U.S. woman's terrifying story has been reported to the US Embassy in Port Moresby, but a duty officer today gave no comment.A spokesman for the police in Port Moresby said a statement had been taken but no arrests had been made.

It`s very sad to see such tragic incidents of atrocities,sexual assault on women are on increase, day by day, all over the world. Mind set of the certain men appears gone derailed horribly worrisome ,creating such nuisance, warranting sternest possible punishment by law of the land. Women`s dignity,modesty,respect need to be protected by us all, in all the circumstances. P.Gautampurkar,Sawai Madh opur,Rajasthan

I just spent three weeks in PNG over Christmas. I can see how these folks were lulled into a false sense of security. A very beautiful and rather REMOTE place. While I never really felt the need to have my normal cache of firearms during the visit, I am a 6'3" male with a 14" bush knife and machete. Not sure why a blond girl would travel in such a small, unarmed group. That is really asking for trouble. PNG isn't a PC nation full of law enforcement and folks that absolve victims for really poor decisions. 7

Swansea City 1 Manchester United 4: Rooney's back in red but Van Persie and Welbeck double up to delight Moyes

Normal service is resumed. Amid what seemed like a mini-tornado at Swansea, David Moyes calmly took the first
steps on a journey of indeterminate length undertaken amid unprecedented scrutiny. For
years we have imagined what Manchester United might look like without Sir Alex Ferguson. For now, the answer is: much the same as before.
Of course, there are sterner tests to come and steeper paths to be travelled. Nevertheless, it was impossible to disguise the satisfaction emanating from an entire football club that the first fence had been negotiated so well. Red hot: Robin van Persie lashed in Manchester United's third goal and his second, from long range Time for No 10: Wayne Rooney made his return to Manchester United first team duty Match facts Swansea: (4-5-1) Vorm 6; Rangel 6, Flores 6, Williams 5, Davies 6; Britton 6 (Bony 46, 6),Canas 5 (Ki 76, 6), Shelvey 7, Dyer 6, Routledge 6 (Hernandez 46, 6); Michu 6.Subs not used: Tremmel, Amat, Pozuelo, Taylor. Booked: Canas.Goal: Bony 82. Manchester United: (4-4-2) De Gea 6; Jones 6, Ferdinand 6, Vidic 6, Evra 6; Valencia 6, Carrick 7, Cleverley 7, Giggs 6 (Rooney 61 6); Welbeck 8, Van Persie 8 (Anderson 86). Subs not used: Lindegaard, Smalling, Fabio, Kagawa, Zaha. Booked: Carrick, Cleverley, Valencia.Goals: Van Persie 34, 72, Welbeck 36, 90. Ref: Dowd.Att: 20,733. Ratings by Ian Ladyman at the Liberty. Click HERE for full results, fixtures and tables in the Premier League - plus your stats zone from the Liberty Stadium United were effortlessly good. Those hoping to exploit the vulnerabilities caused by regime change will have to wait. Many
feel that change might be afoot in the English game - and maybe it still is. But when your starting XI includes Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Robin van Persie it is clear that not so much has really changed. True, there was a late goal conceded and Swansea are a dangerous outfit who threatened at times. United were not faultless, but as debuts go, this was as close to perfect as it comes. There
was even a cameo from Wayne Rooney, which you could interpret in any way you wished. He contributed to two goals in a lively performance but seemed an outsider as his team-mates celebrated those goals. Rain
swirled around the Liberty Stadium and the cold wind provided the most inhospitable of welcomes. But for Moyes it was a day in which metaphorical dark clouds were banished, though naturally there was no fuss afterwards. 'I'm pleased to get it out the way but it's only one of many, and we'll move on to the next one,' he said. 'I think if we had lost, we wouldn't have been talking too much about it. And I will talk about this, but it's a job and it's what we do.' The
previous incumbent had been in touch in the morning to wish him luck - and to complain about an unsuccessful racing tip he had passed on - but otherwise Moyes's mantra was that this was just another normal working day. 'I didn't feel any different,' he said. 'I came here to do a job. The colours were different today but I was doing what I've done for a long time.' Moyes acknowledged that United could have played better in periods and Swansea were, indeed, a threat. Sensational: Robin van Persie opened the scoring with this acrobatic effort
How's that? Robin van Persie celebrates with Patrice Evra after his goal
Here's how Van Persie scored his stunning third - click here for your brilliant stats zone from the Liberty Stadium Michu, in particular, was a handful, forever darting and dashing, irrepressible and indefatigable, having a goal disallowed on 19 minutes, forcing David De Gea into a sharp save on
24 and heading just wide from the resulting corner. When
Wilfried Bony came on at half-time for his Premier League debut, they looked a formidable partnership. But it helps immeasurably when you have
Van Persie on your side. For
Michael Laudrup, the Dutchman's finishing was the difference, and he was right that 4-1 was an unkind result for his Swansea side. The
first goal of the Moyes era matched the magnitude of the occasion. Giggs floated a hopeful ball into the area on 34 minutes which Chico Flores failed to clear and the execution by Van Persie was exquisite. Keeping his cool: David Moyes (centre) with Phil Neville watching as his United side took a first-half leadControlling the ball on his chest, it
seemed to have bounced too high but he was undeterred, leaping and swivelling in one movement to strike it mid-air past Michel Vorm. 'He's
been a pleasure to work with,' said Moyes. 'And he's really keen to improve and get better. You might think, "How good can he get?" I thought his goals today were terrific.' Within two minutes of that opener, United had established a comfort zone.
Patrice Evra floated a cross which fell to Antonio Valencia on the opposite wing. He drove the ball across goal and from two yards Danny Welbeck simply turned it in. Relief emanated from the United bench. Double up: Danny Welbeck extended Manchester United's lead by firing home from close range Celebration time: United players join Welbeck after he pounced on a loose ball and converted
Better than last year? Welbeck only scored one goal in the Premier League in the whole of last seasonThe arrival of Pablo Hernandez and Bony at half-time did tip the scales somewhat and United were on the back foot. But the introduction of the renegade Rooney proved too much. On 72 minutes he fed Van Persie and created a decoy run as his teammate advanced on goal. The
Dutchman turned inside Ashley Williams and evaded Flores to strike superbly from the edge of the box. The entire United bench leapt up for that, Moyes among them. The
serenity was briefly interrupted when Welbeck dallied on the ball outside his area and Hernandez robbed him, darted through to feed Bony and the Ivorian completed a good debut with an excellent finish. Taking no prisoners: Jose Canas feels the force of a challenge from Welbeck Good times: Moyes roars with delight as United turn the screw on Swansea
Destination unknown: Rooney pictured on the bench, watching as his colleagues took charge of the game
Wazza's back: Rooney returned to Manchester United first team duty... but Van Persie was the star man David Moyes pleased with Welbeck and Van Persie
Michael Laudrup didn't such heavy Swansea defeat
The Liberty Stadium hoped, even believed, that something significant might be stirring but it was not to be as this was Moyes's day. When Welbeck ran on to Rooney's ball in added time to deliver a joyously delicate chip over Vorm for the fourth goal it was complete. It was, of course, just the first three points in a long season. But it felt a whole lot more significant than that. Exquisite: Welbeck scored his second with a tidy lob into the far corner
Shake on it: Moyes and Michael Laudrup greeted each other before the match Big kick-off: Phil Dowd picked up the ball as he led the teams out onto the pitch

David Moyes in 2009 calleed the CURRENT FA referee's chief, Mike Riley, a Man Utd fan before the Man Utd-Everton FA Cup game, which he refereed. Even Man Utd's own manager admits referees favour them- SO WHAT DO THE MAN UTD FANS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?????????????????? No doubt that they won't say anything about that as the truth hurts...well at least can't call it a conspiracy anymore, it's fact, even their own manager said it.

Chelsea are a tiny little corner shop, which the locals can walk to. MU are a global brand which you access via modern medium of Internet, television etc. All this nonsense about plastic fans is just that, nonsense. 600 millions supporters can't all live in Manchester, whereas a few Chelsea supporters can. Add to that lack of any class and principles, the Pensioners will remain a tiny corner shop. 4

It looks as through Sarah Harding could be hoping for three wishes if her latest ensemble is anything to go by. The Girls Aloud singer opted for an unusual pair of genie-style trousers as she stepped out in London on Thursday.With a bright blue floral design, the loose-fitting garment seemed to be paying homage to the last few weeks of summer. Missing her lamp: Sarah Harding stepped out in unusual genie-style trousers as she ran errands in London on Thursday
Pairing the wacky trousers with a black vest and a matching leather jacket, the blonde looked happy and relaxed as she ran errands near her home in Primrose Hill.Dark shades protected Sarah's eyes from the early autumn sun, and she teamed her slightly unusual ensemble with an oversized grey handbag and towering black platform stilettos.

The star seemed to be in need of a caffeine hit and carried a large coffee as she went about her chores.Sarah kept her locks long and wavy around her shoulders, and wore minimal make-up as she basked in the sunny weather. Soaking up the sun: The Girls Aloud singer paired her floral trousers with a simple vest top and a leather jacket After a tough year, which has seen the star check into rehab following her split with DJ boyfriend Tom Crane, the singer is embracing a cleaner lifestyle.She told Hello! magazine in a recent interview: 'I've done a lot of healing, a lot of thinking. I went through a break-up with a man I'd been with for five years and who I planned to marry and start a family with and it was horrendous.'I hit rock bottom and went off the rails. I needed to find myself again and I really feel I've done that and turned a corner. I finally feel I'm in a really good place in my life.' Toned: Sarah showed off a hint of her taut stomach as she stepped out near her home in London's Primrose Hill
The star is also preparing for a musical comeback with her Girls Aloud bandmates, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Cole, Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle, as they prepare to mark their 10-year anniversary this November.Sarah added: 'When I watched the Spice Girls on stage at the Olympic closing ceremony I did think, "I want that to be us".'We needed a break, time to do our own things, but now we're starting to feel really nostalgic about the 10 years we've been a band and really want to mark it with something special.' Looking ahead: Sarah is now looking forward to the upcoming Girls Aloud reunion in November to mark the band's tenth anniversary

'I couldn't say words': Malcolm In The Middle star Frankie Muniz reveals the horror of experiencing a stroke at 26... while his fiancée tweets emotional hospital picture

Malcolm in the Middle star Frankie Muniz has revealed that he couldn't speak simple words after suffering a shock stroke at the age of 26. On Good Morning America today the actor/musician explained: I couldn't say words. I thought I was saying them! My fiancee, was looking at me like I was speaking a foreign language.'He also told the show that a loss of vision tipped him off to the neurological problem and it happened in the worse possible circumstances because Muniz was riding his motorcycle in Phoenix on Friday when he realised he couldn't see out of one eye. 'Please be OK' This picture of Frankie Muniz taken after his 'mini stroke' was Tweeted by his girlfriend Elycia Marie Doctors told him he had suffered a 'mini-stroke,' something that happens to fewer than 10 percent of people under 45. Muniz says he doesn't drink, do drugs and has never had a cigarette.
'I can't get a deep breath in,' he said, adding, 'I'm still trying to make sense of it, but happy I'm alive.'
The interview comes after Frankie's girlfriend Elycia Turnbow tweeted a picture of her boyfriend in hospital bed with the emotional caption: 'Please be OK.'
Muniz broke the news himself on Tuesday, via Twitter: 'I was in the hospital last Friday. I suffered a ‘Mini Stroke’, which was not fun at all,' he told his 158,000 online followers. Unsettling ordeal: But Frankie says he's just pleased to be alive after suffering the stroke 'Have to start taking care of my body! Getting old!' he continued. The photo of Muniz looking passed out
under a hospital blanket was posted on Instagram by his longterm girlfriend Elycia Turnbow on Friday when the stroke hit him. Muniz, who turns 27 today, is wearing two plastic hospital bands on the arm of the hand that’s covering his face.Frankie is scheduled to begin touring with his band Kingsfoil on Friday, however he is having to now rest under doctors orders.Muniz
was once considered one of the most bankable teen stars during his years in the hit show Malcolm in the Middle, which finished in 2006 after a six year run. (Bryan Cranston, who played his onscreen dad Hal, is now the Emmy-awarding star of Breaking Bad.) Recovering: The actor posted this message on Twitter late last month
Muniz played the lead character in the show, which was about an ordinary boy who tests at genius level and his dysfunctional family.While his acting career has slowed down, the actor's personal life has made plenty of headlines in recent times. He got engaged to his longtime girlfriend, publicist Elycia Marie Turnbow, in October last year. Tumultuous relationship: Frankie with his fiance Elycia Turnbow in March
The couple had reconciled after a dramatic incident last February where police were called to their home in Phoenix. Muniz allegedly wielded a gun and punched Turnbow in the back of the head during an altercation.His
spokesperson said at the time: 'Neither one is interested in finger-pointing at the other. It was a situation that escalated beyond a
point that it needed to be. If anything, they will look back at this as
a learning opportunity.' Child star: Muniz (center) in Malcolm in the Middle in 2000

My dad had a stroke Jan. 2011 and he still has some speech problems. It's no fun at all. At 25 that has to be extremely scary. I hope he gets better.

Glad Frankie is ok. A stroke is very scary to deal with, specially when it affect your sight. My late husband suffered a stroke when he was 42. Woke up completely blind after a nap one afternoon. Thankfully his sight did slowly return over the following days. Unfortunately his was a complication of extreme high blood pressure while on years of dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant.. He was never quite the same after his stroke, sleeping up to 22 hours a day. He passed away 2 yrs later from a massive heart attack, due to the high toxins in his blood. The worst part about his stroke was the hospital ER making him wait 6 hours in the waiting room to be seen!!!!!

It's an awful feeling. I had a series of mini-strokes following a head injury. Back in the 90's and early 00's, doctors didn't treat these things. I was told that I had a mini-stroke and that I could die at any moment from a CVA or stroke and could expect to descend into schizophrenia or mental illness later in life and that no cognitive or drug therapy existed. LOL. Nothing has changed - but now they milk the insurance company for all it's worth.
