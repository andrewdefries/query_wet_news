Perhaps he regrets turning down the club he supports (Palace). The one he always wanted to play for. Not welcome at Selhurst Park now.

Sky Sports have taken the lead in the TV race to recruit Graeme Swann by offering him a role for the World Twenty20 in March.And Swann, who added to England’s Ashes turmoil by quitting halfway through the series, will be given other opportunities on Sky, including work on the revamped domestic T20 Blast.

Swann was at Sky’s Isleworth headquarters last week for talks with sports chief Barney Francis and later tweeted: ‘Great couple of days down in London working out what to do in the future. Very exciting stuff.’ Swann’s signing would be a considerable U-turn for Francis, who said in Australia after the spin bowler had announced his retirement that he wasn’t interested in adding Swann to the army of ex-England players on Sky.It is understood Sky have no issue about Swann continuing with his BBC Radio 5 Live magazine show Not Just Cricket that he co-presents with Jimmy Anderson and Greg James. But it is unlikely they would be happy with Swann working for BT Sport, who had been the favourites to employ him.Meanwhile, Swann’s former England colleague Kevin Pietersen was in the Sky box at Stamford Bridge to watch Chelsea beat Manchester United. However, the TV network denied they were positioning themselves to sign him if he is jettisoned by England.David Beckham watched the match from Roman Abramovich’s box. The pair are said to know each other well and the Chelsea owner’s money would be useful for Becks’s Major League Soccer franchise in Miami.Thierry Henry is understood to have turned down the opportunity to sign up as a Sky Sports pundit with immediate effect. Henry, whose last season in Major League Soccer doesn’t finish until the autumn, is in no hurry to commit, knowing that BT Sport and Al Jazeera, globally rebranded BeIN Sport, will also offer him big money.

The appointment of Dutchman Andries Jonker as successor to Liam Brady as head of Arsenal’s youth academy has been seen as more of a chief executive Ivan Gazidis appointment than an Arsene Wenger one. But Holland manager Louis van Gaal, who had Jonker as his assistant at Bayern Munich and reckons he is an ideal fit for the Gunners, revealed Wenger was enquiring about Jonker more than a year ago.
Recruited: Dutchman Andries Jonker is to replace Liam Brady as the head of Arsenal's academy
Frank Lampard's late arrival at London’s Savoy Hotel on Sunday night may have held up the Football Writers Association’s tribute to Jose Mourinho. But the eloquent Lampard, rarely using notes, redeemed himself with a memorable speech that upstaged Louis van Gaal’s address and Jose’s reply. Champagne goes flatFormer Fifa executive Jerome Champagne’s launch of his bid for the FIFA presidency in London on Monday turned out to be nothing more than a vanity project.Champagne, who is funding his own campaign, spoke about his desire to globalise football’s world governing body and give more influence to the national associations — especially mending bridges with the FA. He carefully chose as a venue for his press conference the Connaught Rooms, where the FA was founded 151 years ago. Vanity project: Former Fifa executive Jerome Champagne speaks during a news conference in London
But Champagne was not prepared to name any of the five federations he needs to support his candidature, nor whether he would even stand if Sepp Blatter puts himself forward — as is widely expected — for a fifth term.And by refusing to say anything that could be seen as anti-Blatter, Champagne boosted the conspiracy theory that wily old Sepp is pulling his strings in an effort to derail UEFA president Michel Platini’s more relevant challenge.The surreal occasion included an amateurish video of Pele endorsing Champagne in a number of languages. It was anything but convincing. Dominic Cork, one of Alan Brazil’s roster of co-presenters on his talkSPORT breakfast show, has embraced commercial radio to the extent of shamelessly plugging Derbyshire firm Kedleston Windows, who are working on his conservatory.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's bizarre baby name instantly became the subject of jokes around the globe after it was revealed on Thursday. And it seems even the reality TV star, 32, found the name North West rather humorous when it was first raised in public during an interview with Jay Leno back in March. Scroll down for video Not going for North: Kim Kardashian firmly turned down the idea that her child would be named North West in a March interview with Jay Leno
It's official: A birth certificate obtained by MailOnline reveals that the little girl will be called North West, with no middle name
Three months before giving birth, Kim laughed at Leno when he brought up rumours Kanye wanted to name the baby North - 'so he [or she] would be North West.'
Without batting an eyelash, a giggling Kim immediately dismissed the idea and the audience guffawed along with her. 'That is not one of the names on our list,' she insisted, before adding: 'But that I do like Easton West.''It kind of goes with North. I think that's cute,' she said with a smile.Despite her chuckles, North West turned out to be no joke - MailOnline obtained a copy of the birth certificate on Friday, confirming that the couple have settled on the moniker - and no middle name.There was widespread speculation that Kim would follow her family's 'K' tradition but even back in March she admitted that her baby name list was varied. 'Some of them are K names and some of them are not,' she said.
Short term memory loss? Kim on Leno in March 2013...
Another direction: The 32-year-old instead offered the name Easton West, which she thought was 'cute'
Mixing things up: Kim also said that she's fond of the trend to give girls names traditionally used for boys
News
of the baby's name comes five days after Kim was rushed to a hospital in Los Angeles on June 15, giving birth to her daughter after going into
labour five weeks before her due date.One week later, the pair checked out of the hospital following the premature birth. And a source told UsWeekly that the couple have already given their daughter a nickname - she will be 'Nori for short'. Proud parents: Kim and partner Kanye West welcomed their first child on 15 June
While North was to prove her final choice, Kim was said to be very keen on Kaidence, to match her family's fondness of the letter 'K'. The reality star was reported to like the idea of calling the baby Kai for short.And further report claimed the middle name would be Donda, in honour of Kanye's late mother, who died in 2007 due to complications from cosmetic surgery. Nothing official: Despite the birth certificate leak, Kim has yet to make a statement on the baby's name
Meanwhile Kim's close friend Larsa Pippen recently revealed that she had been to visit the baby in the hospital and a decision was nearly made.But she said Kim didn't welcome her suggestions.'We kind of went back and forth and the name that I wanted, [Kim] didn't love,' she said. First for everything: The name of the baby was predicted to start with K, just like the names of the couple and of Kim's siblings
Kim gave birth to her first child Saturday 15 June.Mail Online exclusively revealed that the reality star had been admitted to hospital in Beverly Hills the night before.Kim had taken out a birthing suite at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital of choice among many celebrities including Britney Spears, Victoria Beckham and Jessica Simpson. Something for Kim? Kim's stepfather Bruce Jenner was seen stopping by a flower shop in Tarzana on Friday Hours later - around 1:30 a.m. - she gave birth to her baby girl, now believed to be named North.Her partner, rapper Kanye, and mother Kris Jenner were reportedly at her side. Kim's due date was reportedly July 12, just one day after Kate Middleton. The date would also have been Kanye's mother Donda West's 64th birthday.'A NOVELTY NAME!' TWITTER REACTS TO KIMYE'S BABY NAME NORTH WEST'Kim & Kanye almost named the baby South West, until they heard the infant would then be required to make 3 daily flights to Phoenix.' @joelmchale'Sending poor North West my attorney's number. No one should have to go through life with a novelty name, not even a Kardashian.' @surisburnbook'Sorry North West, but I've never been a fan of One Direction.' @LovesxParadise'We heard North West MONTHS ago. It's like an episode of House where it turns out that it actually was Lupus. What a let down.' @Kelly_C_Chase'Somewhere Blue Ivy is thinking, "My name isn't as bad now, is it"' @NatashaCarpio'oh good when kim and kanye’s daughter has her own fragrance it’ll be called “north, by north west”' ‏@andylevy'The only way we can fix this and save North West is if we all change our names to North to make her feel perfectly normal.' @samir'Wait, #Kim and #Kanye named their kid NORTH WEST? This might be better than Blanket.' @JESSI'North West? Did Kim give birth to a baby or a compass?' @TreMelvin'whenever you're mad at your mom just remember she didnt name you north west' @hashtagfranki'Kim and Kanye would have named their baby South West but that dang airline beat them to it!' @Yowhzie'So Blue Ivy got the stripper name, and North West got the direction to the strip club?

Way to almost spend a minute thinking of a name.' @Brianhopecomedy'Her siblings "South", "Wild Wild" and "Mae" are coming soon...' @djcoreycraig'We need to successfully abolish bullying before North West gets to 4th grade.' @pinkyBrayne'Kim and Kanye named their baby "North West".I guess it's one of the few things in Kim’s life that hasn’t gone south!' @jordansammy'Not even Kim & kanye's fortunes combined could pay for the amount of therapy this kid will need for being named North West.' @ShaunDiviney'Too late to change to "Knorth?"' @kenbakernow
