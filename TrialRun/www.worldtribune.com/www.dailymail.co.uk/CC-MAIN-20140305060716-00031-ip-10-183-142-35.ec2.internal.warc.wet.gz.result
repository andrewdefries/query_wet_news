Laura Williamson: Don't use women's sport just to plug a gap, please Auntie...

For public interest, what comes first, the event or the publicity? I'm sure the FA could do a lot more to spread the message about the matches and the players but I reckon the media must carry the lion's share of the blame. Last Wednesday's Mail had no preview information about the game or its importance for the national team. It wasn't even listed amongst the fixtures for the day!! The kick-off time obviously didn't help for attendance or TV audience but that was down to UEFA. Your Thursday Mail did carry a short report on the result in Football Shorts but it wasn't really enough to keep the team or the players in the spotlight.

Mig was told he was going to be No. 1 so Reina on his cash had to go. I wouldn't buy a car off Brenda Rodgers.
