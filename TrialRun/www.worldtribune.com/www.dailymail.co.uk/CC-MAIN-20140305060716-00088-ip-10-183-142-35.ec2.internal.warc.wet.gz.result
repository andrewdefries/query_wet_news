Comment:
Everyone moans about Kim but I personally think her body is a better role model to young girls than those size zero models
- SophPA , England, 13/11/2012 19:55
>>>> I have no problem with her body or the work she's done. However, please it's not something I wish on someone to go through. The woman is an ad for cosmetic surgery. Breast augmentation, rear enlargement and who knows what else, it's not something that it should be considered a norm and good enough to be copied by others. Your email address:

Residents' fury as council bans APOSTROPHES from street signs 'to avoid confusion'
Author of reported comment:
ChrisCooper, Loughborough

Comment ID:

Comment:
Good puncutation and grammar makes writing clear and unambiguous. Removing it makes writing interpretable. The legal profession loves interpretable language. It allows them to be paid vast sums of money to interpret it for us. This also benefits government and others in power. They can allow things to be interpreted one way before pointing out they always intended them to be interpreted another way. They can also interpret what other people say in a way that suits them. Remember how punctuation does not matter when you are being carted off to prison for threatening to eat your grandma, when actually you were inviting her to eat. "Let's eat Grandma" and "Let's eat, Grandma" are not the same thing.

Could your compost kill you? Bacteria that can cause disease in humans - and even death - is present in bags of organic material

Hang on a minute, the article shows a guy diging his bare hands into a bag of compost. No gardener with any regard for their health would have done this since the 1960's when it became known that tetanus was infecting people who had cuts on their hands while gardening and then getting their hands filthy with compost. I always wear thick gloves while gardening, and as for an airborne infection such as Legionella longbeachae. The odds of contracting it this way are remote indeed

It's no secret that David Beckham loves being a father as he is constantly spotted enjoys days out with his wife and kids.But leaving Victoria and Harper at home, David and his three boys, Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz were pictured last night as they took their seats in the Los Angeles Staples Center to watch the LA Kings take on the New Jersey Devils.The boys were seen hollering and cheering as the teams battled one another on the ice to take home the Stanley Cup. Father-of-four: David Beckham was spotted last night as he took his sons to see the LA Kings take on the New Jersey Devils at the Los Angeles Staples Center
The doting father-of-four carried his youngest son Cruz for most of the match probably to help the seven-year-old get a better view of the match.David was seen putting a loving arm around Romeo, 10, as they got lost in the intense game which saw the Kings defeat the Devils 6-1.His sons were pictured eating ice cream and joking around with their 37-year-old father as they sat in their rink side seats. The baby of the boys: The 37-year-old was pictured carrying his youngest son Cruz during the match
Sharing secrets: Cruz was seen whispering his David's ear at one point during the game
Doting father: David placed his loving arm around Romeo's neck

In the late summer of 2001, Michael Jackson’s family were after him again. It was two days before his scheduled departure for New York, where his 30th Anniversary concerts were to be staged at Madison Square Garden. Performers would include Destiny’s Child, Ray Charles and Whitney Houston, and friends Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando had been recruited to deliver televised speeches.Michael wanted his family in New York as well; his brothers to perform a medley of hits from their days as the Jackson 5, while his parents sat in special box seats. The Jacksons insisted that they should receive appearance fees and it was agreed that family members would get honorariums of $250,000, even those who would just be there to watch the show. Pride and joy: Michael Jackson, pictured with his two oldest children Prince and Paris in 2001, was used by his family for money, something which continued after his death
Just days before the first concert, though, Jermaine Jackson read an article that said his brother would be making as much as $10 million from the two shows and convinced his parents that Michael should pay the three of them another $500,000 apiece.Jermaine and his father Joe drew up a contract and, with mother Katherine in tow, chased Michael around California to try to get him to sign. Michael took refuge for several days at the house of his friend Marc Schaffel, co-producer of the event, then made a dash north to Neverland Ranch. He and his two young children, four-year-old Prince and three-year-old Paris, had barely set foot inside the house when Joe, Katherine and Jermaine appeared at the gate. More...

Michael told the security guards to tell his family he wasn’t there. Joe Jackson, though, refused to budge. ‘I’m his father,’ Joe told the guards. ‘I need to use the bathroom. His mother needs to use the bathroom. Let us in.’Frantic, Michael phoned Schaffel. If they got through the gate, his family would hound him to sign this contract, he explained. But he couldn’t keep his mother locked outside when she was pleading just to use the bathroom. He told Schaffel he would instruct the guards to tell his family again that Mr Jackson was not on the premises, but to admit them so that they could use the facilities.But as soon as Joe and Jermaine were through the gate, they drove to the main house and pushed their way inside. ‘They literally ransacked the place,’ Schaffel remembered. Michael retreated with Prince and Paris to a hiding place concealed behind a secret door at the back of his bedroom closet and phoned Schaffel from there. He was in tears, literally whimpering into the phone. Sisterly love: Michael Jackson, with sisters and Janet, right, and LaToya who allegedly ransacked his home for cash and valuables
‘You see what they do to me? Do you understand now why I don’t want anything to do with my brothers, why I hide from them and refuse to answer their phone calls?‘I’ve supported my brothers, supported them all,’ Michael cried. ‘I’ve put their kids through school. But they still come after me, still wanting more. It never ends. And my father’s worse than they are.’Michael choked up, Schaffel recalled, and then sobbed: ‘The worst part, the part that kills me, is that I have to lie to my own mother. Do you understand, Marc?’ Michael asked. ‘Do you understand now why I am the way I am? How else could I be?For someone who so often professed his loneliness, Michael Jackson spent a remarkable amount of time avoiding people. He wore disguises, broke off relationships, and changed telephone numbers, but still paparazzi, delusional women, and desperate men pursued him. The saddest part, though, was that the people Michael took the greatest pains to elude were the members of his own family. Guardian: The three Jackson children with their grandmother Katherine who has been giving money she received from her son to other members of the family
Until the time he found a way to live off his sons’ talent, his father Joe had worked the four-to-midnight shift as a crane operator amid the blast-furnace heat of the Inland Steel Mill, in Gary, Indiana. He earned barely enough to sustain the family home – a tiny aluminium-sided cube in which 11 people shared a bathroom. Michael’s memories of early rehearsals all centred on the father/manager who bellowed at them constantly, smacking his sons or throwing them into walls if they made a mistake. When the band signed to Motown, Michael was quickly singled out as the star. Jackie and Tito possessed only modest musical talent and Marlon had none at all. Jermaine had an adequate singing voice. Such was Michael’s talent that just one year after signing with the label, the group delivered a debut record, I Want You Back, that shot to the top of the Billboard Hot 100. In February 1970, the Jackson 5 released their second single, ABC. And with The Love You Save and I’ll Be There, they became the first group ever to send their first four releases to the top of the charts. Between tours, Joe and his sons returned home to a five-bedroom, six-bathroom mansion in the Los Angeles enclave of Encino. There was an Olympic-size swimming pool, sports facilities, luxury cars and servants’ quarters. Reunited: His brothers, including Jermaine, left, hounded Michael over fees for appearing at the King of Pop's 30th Anniversary shows in 2001
By the mid-Seventies, the Jackson 5 were in professional decline – in sharp contrast with Michael, the true star of the group. His brothers had wanted to work on the Off The Wall album with him, but Michael refused, even when his mother attempted to convince him that he owed them. Released in 1979, it sold nearly seven million copies worldwide.Then came the release of Thriller in December 1982, which turned him into, as Rolling Stone put it, ‘quite simply, the biggest star in the pop music universe’. Off The Wall had already made him wealthier than the rest of his family put together, now he would earn more than $200 million from sales of the Thriller album.No longer his manager, his father was as calculating as ever. He knew that playing the boys against one another was a winning strategy. What a great idea it would be, he suggested to Jackie, Tito, Marlon, and Randy, to capitalise on the success of Thriller by including Michael in a ‘reunion tour’.Michael resisted. He was tired of touring, he said, tired of all the attention, tired of travel and hotel rooms. Tired of his family, period. The brothers first tried using guilt to sway him. Marlon was going through a divorce and couldn’t even make his mortgage payments. Maybe he should sell up and buy a smaller house, Michael suggested. The brothers then called a meeting at which they showed up with a life-size poster of Michael and told him they were going to put it onstage in his place. Michael wouldn’t relent. It was time to play their ace in the hole. During a private meeting Katherine requested with Michael, she implored him to join his brothers on the tour. They needed the money, she told her son. Finally, when all else failed, she pulled out the big gun: ‘For me, Michael, please?’ Legacy: Michael Jackson, on stage during the Dangerous Tour, left his children everything
It was a choice between the only two things Michael had, his mother’s love and his career. He chose his mother’s love, of course.At
the first stop in Kansas City, Jermaine told a reporter: ‘Even though Michael is very talented, a lot of his success has been due to timing and a little bit of luck. It could have been him, or it could just as easily have been me.’Michael
distanced himself from his brothers as the tour progressed, refusing to
stay on the same hotel floor with them. He insisted his attorneys be present at the business meetings that, within the first few dates, became the only conversations he had with his siblings. The other Jacksons insisted upon collecting their payments immediately after each
show. No one in his family, though, was prepared for the shout-out Michael gave on December 9, 1984: ‘This is our last and final show. It’s been a long 20 years and we love you all.’ Michael looked at the shocked expressions on his brothers’ faces and couldn’t suppress his smile.Now established as one of the most famous families on the planet, life among the Jacksons was becoming a soap opera, and a sordid one at that. Michael was determined to distance himself. The public humiliations seemed endless. In 1983, Jackie’s affair with Los Angeles Lakers cheerleader and future television talent-show judge Paula Abdul blew up his marriage. In March 1987, Jermaine showed up for Marlon’s birthday party carrying his three-month-old son by a woman named Margaret Maldonado, while his wife looked on with an expression of bewilderment. During their divorce, Jermaine’s wife Hazel would allege that her husband had attempted to rape her.By 1990, Michael had moved to Neverland, his personal amusement park in Santa Barbara County, California. He made no comment when newspapers reported that Randy’s wife Eliza was accusing her husband of beating her throughout her pregnancy. The Jackson brothers were all just like Joe, Eliza told a reporter, except for Michael. Though they depended on his money, usually dispensed through their mother Katherine, his siblings weren’t averse to criticising their brother in public.Michael’s relationship with his sister La Toya was shattered in December 1993, when she responded to the Jordan Chandler scandal by holding a press conference in Tel Aviv, at which she declared her belief that the accusations against her brother were true. Golden boy: It became clear early in their career that Michael was the one in The Jackson Five (left to right: Tito, Marlon, Jackie, Michael and Jermaine) who had true talent
‘I can’t remain silent,’ she squeaked into a bank of microphones. ‘I will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against small, innocent children.’ [Jordan
was a 13-year-old boy whom Michael has been accused of sexually molesting. The claims, which Jackson always denied, resulted in a payment of more than $18 million to the boy’s family. He would later describe the decision to make a deal with the Chandlers, his lawyer said, as ‘the worst mistake of his life’.]In
2003, when Michael’s world was collapsing all around him, amid his arrest on further child molestation charges, of which he would be acquitted two years later, Jermaine had gone to New York publishers with
a ‘tell-all’ book proposal. The Jacksons viewed youngest brother Randy as the most conniving among them. He was a chip off the old block, far more like Joe than any of his brothers, visitors said – and that wasn’t intended as a compliment. Joe Jackson had been hiding from creditors since 1987. He was living mostly on hand-outs from Katherine (who divvied up the $25,000 cheque Michael sent to her each month among needy family members) and was incessantly looking for opportunities to draw his most famous son into business deals. THE JARFUL OF STICK-ON NOSESIn his closet at Neverland,
Jackson kept a big jar of fake noses of various shapes and sizes, surrounded by tubes of stage glue. ‘He told me they were for disguises,’
recalled Adrian McManus, one of his staff at the ranch. At this point, Michael was disguising the result of at least six rhinoplasty operations: a pair of nostrils surrounded by a rim of shrivelled, shrunken, discoloured cartilage.The singer had been a skilled make-up artist since his teens, and in 15 minutes at the mirror could create an appearance that fooled most people. Plastic surgeons had been speculating on TV since as early as 1990 that the tip of his nose had been replaced by a prosthetic of either bone or plastic. By about 2001, the way his nose changed from year to year, sometimes from week to week, had given him away.But
he managed to salvage something from this personal disaster: at least he could now have the nose he had always wanted – Bobby Driscoll’s. The most famous child star of the late Forties and early Fifties, Driscoll had for years been an icon of Jackson’s to rival Shirley Temple. There
is footage from 2002 of Jackson standing amid an enthralled crowd outside the Virgin Megastore in Times Square, New York, his Bobby Driscoll nose raised to the sky as if to declare: ‘I am Peter Pan.’
‘They all looked to Michael as an ATM machine,’ observed the Los Angeles attorney and radio host Leo Terrell.Within hours of Michael’s death on June 25, 2009, the battle over the estate began. The King of Pop was going to be worth a billion dollars, maybe two billion, maybe more. The women of the clan initiated what became a week-long occupation and search of the Carolwood Drive chateau in Los Angeles where he died. The first night, La Toya Jackson and her boyfriend Jeffre Phillips demanded to be admitted to the house. Three hours later, Katherine went inside after them.It was mid-morning in London when Michael’s children’s former nanny Grace Rwaramba received a call from Katherine. According to Rwaramba, Katherine began the conversation: ‘Grace, the children are crying. They are asking about you. They can’t believe that their father died. Grace, you remember Michael used to hide cash at the house? I’m here. Where can it be?’But security guards said it was La Toya, along with her boyfriend, who loaded black rubbish bags filled with cash into duffel bags and placed them in the garage. La Toya would later insist that nearly all of Michael’s money was gone by the time she arrived at the house.It did not become obvious that the Jacksons intended to remove whatever valuables were inside the house until the next morning, when Janet Jackson arrived at the front gate and demanded that it be opened to admit the moving van behind her. A couple of hours later the van left with La Toya’s boyfriend Phillips at the wheel. Katherine
and her daughters made it clear they wouldn’t be leaving any time soon.
‘They camped out for most of a week,’ the head of the security firm recalled, coming and going ‘whenever they felt like it.’Michael’s
will came to light about a week after his death; its executors were to be a lawyer, an accountant and a former record company executive named by Michael. It stipulated that 40 per cent of his estate was to be held in trust for Prince, Paris, and his third child Blanket. Another 20 per cent would be assigned to various charities; the remaining 40 per cent would be used to support Katherine, who would be guardian of Michael’s children. After Katherine’s death, her share would revert to the children. In the meantime, the executors had ‘absolute discretion’ to decide how the money from the
Katherine Jackson Trust would be distributed. There was no provision for Michael’s father or siblings. Moneygrabbing: LaToya, pictured with Paris, and her boyfriend allegedly drove to Michael Jackson's house after his death and stuffed binbags with cash
Over the next two years, the clamour among Katherine’s children to collect their mother’s share of the estate grew ever more threatening. For some time, almost nothing was left over for Katherine’s children; according to the executors, Michael had made it clear that he did not intend to provide for his siblings.Even when Katherine’s monthly stipend was increased to $8,000, several of her children demanded that she challenge the estate’s administration. The opening act of the craziest Jackson family drama since Michael’s death began on July 14, when Katherine, 82, was flown to a spa resort in Tucson, Arizona, without the knowledge of her grandchildren, but accompanied by a group of her children.Within a few days, the media were reporting on a letter that had been signed by five of Michael’s siblings – Randy, Janet, Jermaine, Rebbie, and Tito – demanding that the executors of Michael’s will resign and stating that the will itself was ‘fake, flawed, and fraudulent’. [The American courts have upheld the will. Yet the allegations, dismissed by the executors as wrong and defamatory, surfaced again last month when David Gest, a longtime friend of Michael, spoke out in support of the siblings’ claim.]The adults responsible for Michael’s children, including his nephew TJ Jackson, became convinced that Michael’s brothers and sisters intended to gain a conservatorship [a legal form of control in America] over Katherine, possibly by demonstrating her incompetence to serve as the guardian of the children.
The money, as everyone knew, would follow those three children.Still
more outlandish, though, were the events of Monday, July 23. Shortly after 1pm, Prince and Paris were in an SUV returning home to the Calabasas estate through the double gates when another SUV, loaded with passengers, pulled right up to its bumper. Randy Jackson was at the wheel of the tailing vehicle, which made it to the inner gate just as the barrier was coming down. Legend lost: Michael Jackson left his billion dollar estate to his children, but members of his family are still trying to get their hand on the money
‘He just drove through and broke the arm off,’ recalled Sandra Ribera, an associate of Katherine’s lawyer, who was watching from the pool house. ‘All of a sudden the doors open and there’s this swarm of people pointing cameras all around.’ Ribera said the people in the driveway were Randy Jackson, Janet Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, and several of Prince, Paris, and Blanket’s cousins. It was friendly at first, with hugs all round. But Katherine’s security team, who were guarding the house, quickly realised that the other Jacksons were there to take Michael’s children. Janet went for her niece Paris, while Randy approached Prince and Jermaine engaged the guards, all three of them still using their cell phones as video cameras. When Janet and Randy told Paris and Prince they were coming with them, both teenagers flatly refused to go. Prince turned his back on Randy, but Jermaine pulled the boy aside and told him this was something that had been in the planning for three years and that it was important for him to join in with the rest of the family. Prince shrugged off Jermaine and continued walking toward the house. Paris, meanwhile, made it clear to Janet that she wouldn’t be leaving.The TMZ entertainment website would initially report, based on anonymous sources, that Janet told Paris she was a ‘spoiled little bitch’ and that Paris answered: ‘This is our house, not the Jackson family house. Get the f*** out!’When
security guards blocked his way, Randy, who had been smiling up until then, began to snarl warnings about not interfering in a family matter. Caught up: Michael Jackson's three children Blanket, Paris and Prince Michael have had a difficult relationship with their aunts and uncles since the death of their father
One of the guards suggested perhaps he should leave the property and Randy became enraged, cursing in the man’s face, which was when Trent Jackson, a cousin and a member of the security team, grabbed him. The two grappled, then the bull-strong Trent put Randy in a headlock.The scuffle ended when Trent withdrew with Prince and Paris into the house. Those who were staying at Calabasas would say later that the saddest thing about the entire scene was the way Jermaine had used his sons.‘Jermaine is cursing as bad as you can curse in front of these kids and fighting and doing all this stuff, and he’s telling his kids to videotape it,’ Ribera recalled. ‘And Jermajesty [Jermaine’s son] . . . is just sobbing. His face is covered in tears. He’s taping, but he’s sobbing.’ A sheriff’s car answering an emergency call arrived at the front gate and everyone froze. The sheriff’s deputies persuaded Randy, Janet, and Jermaine and their group to leave. ‘Gotta love fam,’ Paris tweeted to her followers shortly after they were gone. On July 26, Katherine was finally brought home. That series of clumsily plotted scenes left her brood more divided than ever. But it was a comfort to her to know that, in the end, they would all be together again. Katherine’s deal with Forest Lawn Cemetery to acquire Michael’s crypt in the Sanctuary of Ascension had included the purchase of 11 other burial spots. In death, Michael Jackson would be surrounded by the family he had tried to keep at a distance for most of his life.Untouchable: The Strange Life And Tragic Death of Michael Jackson by Randall Sullivan is published by Grove Press, priced £18.99.
