Well it is sizzling hot! Maria Menounos slips into a black string bikini to cool off on Greek beach break

Comment:
Some of the comments on here are disgraceful. It is obvious she has an amazing figure! The piercing is personal choice and I actually think it looks good, as do many other people as it's one of the most popular piercings after ear lobes. With regard to cellulite, most women have it or will get it at some point so if you're so perfect now then I wish I was a fly on the wall the second you notice you get a dimple on your thigh. I'm only 21 and I have it, for 35 she looks pretty darn good! As for the boney chest, that's fairly common and natural in pear shapes. They don't really store fat up top. You can't click on an article about someone on this website without finding nasty, critical and unnecessary comments. Your email address:
