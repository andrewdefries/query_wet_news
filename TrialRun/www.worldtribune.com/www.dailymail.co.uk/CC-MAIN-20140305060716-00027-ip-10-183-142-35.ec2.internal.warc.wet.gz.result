Mind the gap: Beach boardwalk left with 20metre gap after resident who owns the land refuses to let council build walkway in front of their houseLocal authority did not realise land had been owned privately since 1915Landowners refuse walkway completion, making route less accessible

A council funded boardwalk costing £103,000 has been left unfinished after residents who own part of the route refused permission to build along a 20m stretch.The 400m boardwalk on Shoreham beach, West Sussex, was put up in Autumn 2011 but Adur and Worthing District Council did not realise part of the route was owned by local residents.According to the Land Registry the stretch is part of the plot attached to a house backing onto the beach, and the owners have refused to allow the council to build the walkway there. The 20-metre gap in the walkway makes the route less accessible for people with mobility problems
This has caused criticism because it will make access to the beach more difficult for people with mobility problems and for young families with pushchairs.The elderly owners, who do not wish to be named, explained that the land in question has been owned by the house since 1915 and that they have no wish to sell it to the council.

They added that they have never stopped people walking along the shingle to the back of their home but do not want the walkway to be built.Joss Loader, editor of Beach News in Shoreham and Vice-Chairman of Shoreham Beach Residents' Association, said: 'Shoreham Beach Residents' Association supports the boardwalk and believes it is an invaluable community resource, particularly for disabled people and young families with pushchairs. Unfinished: The 20-metre gap in the walkway makes it inaccessible for wheelchair and pushchair users
Incomplete: The boardwalk along the shinge at Shoreham cost £103,000 and has been left with a large gap
Not in my backyard: The owners refused permission for the council to complete the boardwalk behind their house
'We believe that everybody should have access to this unique open space, and be able to enjoy the sea views and the nature reserve, which supports many rare plants.'We are keen to see a situation whereby Adur District Council works with affected local residents to reach a solution as soon as possible.'Joy Daintree, chairman of the Friends of Shoreham Beach, said: 'The boardwalk was put up in Autumn 2011 and has been in this state ever since.'We had a celebration when the boardwalk first went down. We had been campaigning for better access on the beach for two years before that.'Nobody seemed to know that that bit of beach was privately owned. Campaign: Supporters of the walkway are fighting to get the gap filled in
'I think the council must have felt reasonably certain it was publicly owned as people have always had free access in the past.'The reason we wanted it is for people who are dependent on four wheels and find it difficult to get across the shingle.'They now can't use it anyway because of the gap.'Mrs Daintree has now started a petition called 'Fill That Gap' which she is hoping will show public support.Posters have been put up in the local church and shop in support of the campaign.She added that one option was to bend the boardwalk around the private area of land but that it reached so far out the shingle might not be strong enough to support it that far down the beach.Adur and Worthing District Council confirmed that the area of land owned by the couple on the beach is 20 metres wide by around 18 metres long.John Mitchell - Strategic Director Adur & Worthing Councils said: 'The Council is pleased that the Boardwalk on Shoreham Beach has proved to be so popular with beach goers since its installation.'A lot of positive feedback has been provided by our community about the boardwalk.'At the same time we recognise that the existing gap in the Boardwalk renders it incomplete and is inconvenient.'The Council remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of the gap.'Options to close the gap are currently being investigated and it is the intention to bring the details of these options back to Councillors for a decision in the next month or two.'We are aware that there remains strong feeling among the community about the need to close the gap in the Boardwalk, and to potentially extend the Boardwalk at a later date.' Putting their foot down: The landowners who own the 20-metre stretch have refused to let the council buy the land

New chapter: Boston bombing victim Jeff Bauman is releasing a book about his experiences in April
Boston
bombing survivor Jeff Bauman has written a book that will be published a week before the first anniversary of the deadly blast in April.His publisher revealed the cover of the book, 'Stronger', on Twitter on Tuesday night, ahead of Bauman's appearance at the State of the Union speech.After heading to the Capitol for the event, Bauman tweeted: 'I wore pants for the first time in 9 months! And I also met the president.'The cover shows him standing on two prosthetic legs with 'Boston' emblazoned across his t-shirt.The New Hampshire native, 27, lost both of his lower legs in the April 15 attack. An iconic photo taken moments after the blast showed Bauman gray-faced with nothing but exposed bone below his knees.But he has since overcome unimaginable adversities to remain positive and Grand Central Publishing will publish the book about his experiences on April 8, CBS Boston reported.Bauman, who was working to pay off his
student loans at the deli counter in Costco before the life-changing blast, worked with co-writer Bret Witter on the book.A description on Amazon explains: 'Jeff Bauman woke up on Tuesday, April 16th 2013 and he had no legs. Fighter: On Tuesday, Bauman, right, appeared beside Carlos Arredondo, who helped save his life after the bombings, at the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol

'Jeff
asked for a pad and paper and he wrote down seven words, "Saw the guy. Looked right at me", setting off one of the biggest manhunts in the country’s history and beginning his own brave road to recovery.' It adds that the book aims to inspire people by sharing his experiences and his mission to walk again.'Jeff will show the terrorists that they accomplished nothing with their act of cowardice and prove to the entire

Life-changing: Carlos Arredondo pinches Bauman's femoral artery as they rush from the blast site moments after the April 15 bombing in Boston. Bauman lost both lower legs and much of his hearing
Battle: He lost both of his lower legs in the blast and has since been fitted with prosthetic limbs
Bauman appeared at the State of the
Union speech alongside the man who helped save him, Carlos Arredondo. The men have remained close and Bauman was pictured with his arm around the man's shoulder.Bauman went to the marathon waiting to see his girlfriend cross the finish line when was close to one of the explosive-filled backpacks allegedly placed by the Tsarnaev brothers.He
was thrown by the force of the blast and opened his eyes to find himself in a pool of blood. He saw one of his friends look at his legs in horror and looked down to see his limbs were shredded.He
underwent an emergency amputation to remove his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until four inches above the knees. Support: He is pictured with his girlfriend, Erin Hurley, who had been running the marathon that day
Authorities have praised Bauman, who also lost much of his hearing in the blast, as key to stopping Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar after he helped identify them as the suspects.'Even in the ambulance ride I was trying to say something, trying to say, like, "I knew who did it, I knew
what went on",' he said in an earlier interview with NBC News. 'And then I think they were kind of thrown back by that.'Bauman
added that he is now looking forward and, while he could wonder how differently he could have acted that day to avoid the blast, there is no
point.Instead, he is focusing on his recovery, which has impressed doctors.'It's insane,' he said. 'I'm a quick healer. They were calling me 'Wolverine'.' Read more:

One doesn't need to be a paramedic like me to see that he was in shock and in danger of dying as he was being rushed to medical care in that wheelchair. You loonies who want to debase and discredit these people who suffered out to have to lose a limb yourselves, see how you feel about it then. 2

Go back to your bunker and put your tin foil hat back on. I was there. I was volenterring at the finish line that day. I helped pull down the fencing and barricades to get to him and the others. I was there when they picked him up off the sidewalk. You are just another loon.

Some idiots actually believe this never happened and actors were used. The conspiracy theory nuts have anything to say to this man who is battling against the odds to get back his life?
