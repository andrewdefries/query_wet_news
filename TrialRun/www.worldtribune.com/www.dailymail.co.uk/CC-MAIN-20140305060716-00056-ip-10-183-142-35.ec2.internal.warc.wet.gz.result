He's actually a veracious eater, rather than ferocious! - easy mistake to make. But what is not known, is that the BBC filmed Oliver's operation and recovery of the pendant for a new daytime TV series next year, gruesome! Your email address:

Something to smile about! Man of Steel stars Russell Crowe and Henry Cavill bask on red carpet as retelling of Superman story scores big at box office

Comment:
Christi needs to know a LOT more about Crowe before criticising. Crowe has actually been home with his children in Australia since Christmas time and has stated that he NEVER takes vacations outside Australia. His trip to Greece earlier this month was location spotting with film executives. Did she actually think Les Mis was mediocre?
Lastly film premieres are no place for 7 and 10 year old children. He prefers to keep them away from Hollywood and that can only be a wise thing. PS his hair has silver in it. Not unusual for a 49 year old. We all get old, even Christi.
