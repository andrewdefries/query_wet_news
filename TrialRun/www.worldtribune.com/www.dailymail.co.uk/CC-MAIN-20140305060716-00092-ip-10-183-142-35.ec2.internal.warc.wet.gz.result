Cringe-worthy photographs of Charlize Theron modeling in Seventeen magazine around the age of 18 have emerged.The blonde-haired beauty, who looks much the same as she does today, is seen pulling a number of carefree poses as she showcases the latest fashions.New York-based photographer Carolyn Jones told MailOnline that the Oscar-Winning actress, now aged 37, was 'game for anything' during the editorial shoot and 'terrific to work with'. Youthful appeal: Charlize Theron's looks have barely changed over the years as demonstrated in this Seventeen magazine shoot she did as a teenager
'It was really lively and funny,' she added. One frame shows Ms Theron cheekily blowing bubble gum at the camera and another shows her carrying a satchel wearing thigh-length socks, skorts and chunky brogues. Life in the spotlight: Ms Theron quit modeling to pursue an acting career when she was 19 years old
In one sports-inspired shot she appears dressed in gym kit with her foot resting on a basketball and her fist pumping the air.Photographer Ms Jones said that Ms Theron's outgoing personality really 'added to the spirit of it.'Ms Theron, an only child, from Benoni, South Africa, started her modeling career aged 16 after winning a local model contest.The win came the same year she witnessed her mother, Gerda Maritz, killing her alcoholic father Charles in self-defence.

From Dita Von Teese's red-carpet dresses to the costumes of Mad Men, Hollywood's favorite vintage shop is now the star of its own TV show
Modeling jobs took her to Europe and she relocated to Milan for a short time. Recalling one of her early jobs she previously told talk show host Jay Leno: 'I had one horrible experience. I was about 16 years old. 'I did a job in Morocco and they were shooting me on this camel and the sun was setting... And the photographer wanted this camel right in this one position.
'[But] finally the camel just said, ''No more,'' and decided that was it and threw me off - like bucked me off him.
'Long story short, the camel had hit its head back into my face and dislocated my jaw and I had no idea. I came home with X-rays.'
Career on camera: Ms Theron started her modeling career aged 16 after winning a local model contest
Flashback: Photographer Carolyn Jones said that Ms Theron was 'game for anything'
She said that she was constantly told to lose weight but her heart wasn't in it and she told the New York Times that she 'saw modeling like waitressing - it was
a way to pay for another career, and that career was dance.'She later moved to New York for a modeling job with Pauline's Model Management but once there she decided to stay-on and pursue her dreams of becoming a ballerina.'I went to New York for three days to
model, and then I spent a winter in New York in a friend’s windowless basement apartment,' she told the New York Times. Strike a pose: Photographer Carolyn Jones said she couldn't remember the theme of the shoot, which took place in the early Nineties, but it was really lively and funny
'I
was broke, I was taking class at the Joffrey Ballet... My mom came over
from South Africa and said, ''Either you figure out what to do next or you come home, because you can sulk in South Africa.''At 19, after a knee injury prevented her from dancing, she bought a one-way ticked to LA and that was when her acting career took off.Since becoming an actress however she has secured numerous modeling gigs - she is currently the face of Christian Dior's perfume J'Adore - and graced hundreds of magazine covers. Destiny: Despite her beauty Ms Theron, pictured here when she was 16 years old, said she 'was too tall, too big, too late for the supermodel look of the Eighties'
However she says that she has to work hard to keep her body in shape for the camera.'I'm sure there are women who never have to worry about what they eat. But I do. I exercise a lot, and I hike a lot. My mom and I hike at least three times a week,' she told Vogue.'I was too tall, too big, too late for the supermodel look of the Eighties. Kate Moss and all the tiny, grungy girls had just become fashionable, and I didn't fit the bill.' Read more:

I don't believe Barbie will last very long.Who still buys those dolls? No level-headed 21st C mother would(or should) buy them for their daughter.Its unrealistic,sexist and fills girls' heads with incorrect ideals about the modern woman.Now if Mattel decides to put her in a Clinton powersuit(just making a ref. don't bite my head off) instead of making her up like Nicki Minaj,I wont have a problem.

A company behind a new range of Afro style washing up sponges has been slammed for being racist.Campaigners have attacked British makers Paladone for its latest range of dish cleaning products which caricatures black soul legend Diana Ross as having a brillo pad for a hairstyle.The offending items, which have just gone on sale across the UK, have been likened to reproducing golliwogs or the Black and White Minstrels by reinforcing negative stereotypes. 'Negative stereotypes': The range of dish washing products have been branded racist The Unite Against Fascism general secretary Weyman Bennett said: ‘What are we going to have next, toilet brushes like that?
‘This is not appropriate for the 21st century to show images like that. It reinforces negative stereotypes and ideas. More...

‘Although it’s aimed at being humorous, sometimes it’s not funny. 'We’ve spent 40 years removing racist
imagery out of general politics, removing golly wogs, removing black and white minstrels, and it would be a shame if it crept back in.
Anger: The cleaning brushes 'were not appropriate for the 21st century', campaigners said
Mr Bennett, who has been campaigning for almost thirty years, warned: ‘It opens the door for people to produce racial stereotypes and that’s not something we want to see in our society. Offence: Unite Against Fascism's Weyman Bennett slammed the makers for reinforcing 'negative stereotypes''We’ve worked very hard to make sure that doesn’t happen.‘That’s can’t be a positive thing in the 21st centry that we are using images that were really invented in periods of slavery and discrimination.'
Aiming a stinging attack directly at the company behind the products and called on them to be take off the supermarket shelves.Mr Weyman said: ‘They need to think again. Is there no way they can come up with positive views of people without just using negative views of black people.
‘Trying to compare black people’s to brillo pads is not a really positive image – it’s not appropriate.'Paladone said the range had been a phenomenal success since hitting the shelves.But its attempts to give the humble cleaning implement a funky 70s disco makeover seems to have backfired.
A company spokesman said: ‘Our range of four washing up sponges are designed to make an everyday chore like washing up more fun.
‘The Disco, Beehive, Punk and Diva have sold hundreds of thousands of pieces. They have been a phenomenal success.’
Each, priced at up to £8, are currently on sale in the UK.

Brazilian stroke victim cannot stop helping others after developing pathological generosity because of changes in the brainMan, 49, developed 'excessive and persistent generosity' according to researchersLost control of his finances and couldn't return to his job in a large corporation following change in behavior Stroke victim said it was time to 'enjoy life' and 'be in high spirits' By

The man's frontal lobe showed signs of low blood flow, although the stroke occurred in a subcortical region of the brain which is linked to higher level thinking
A man in Brazlil developed what doctors have called pathological generosity, after a stroke damaged parts of his brain causing his behaviour to change. The 49-year-old began to give away money, food and drinks excessively after a stroke disrupted the part of his brain related to higher thinking and decision making. Researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro concluded the man was left with 'excessive and persistent generosity' by the stroke which was brought on by bleeding in his brain. Doctors were able to determine the stroke occurred in a subcortical region of Mr A's brain which controls higher level thinking, and therefore could have affected areas associated with regulating normal behavior. It was caused by bleeding in the brain, a side effect of the man's high blood pressure. But,
experts say knowing where the stroke occurred does not predict changes
in behavior or personality, as the complexity of networks means an area
not necessarily next to the injury can be affected. Dr Larry Goldstein, a neurologist and director of the Stroke Centre at Duke University said: 'Although the observation of personality change is not that unusual, this particular one is apparently novel.'
The doctor told the Huffington Post: 'Stroke can cause a whole variety of neuropsychological and behavioral changes', adding that brain damage caused by low oxygen supply can lead to emotional changes with depression being the most common. Stroke has also been known to cause uncontrollable laughing or crying or neglect syndrome, in which people don't recognize one side of their visual field. More...

Could hyperactivity be linked to poor HEARING? Scientists discover that inner ear problems and restlessness are caused by the same faulty gene
Doctors at the University in Rio de Janeiro found Mr A's case particularly interesting as it represented the opposite attitude to conditions which result from stroke more commonly, such as hoarding and sociopathy. Studies have indicated in the past that certain brain structures, including the region which registers reward, have been involved in instances of generosity like donating anonymously donating to charity. The researchers said Mr A's condition could shed light on the relationship between 'altruism and egoism' which are crucial to decision making. According to the man's wife he started giving away money and food excessively and became unable to control his finances
According to his wife, the man spent his money on food and drink for children in the street, and was incapable of resuming his managerial job within a large corporation after the stroke. When
asked by researchers if he wanted to return to work, he reportedly said
he had worked enough and that it was time to 'enjoy life which is too short.' Mr A told doctors he
was aware of changes in his behavior and claimed he 'saw death from close up' and wanted to 'be in high spirits' from then onwards.Other streaks of generous behavior have been linked to people with mania, dementia and Parkinson's disease when treated, but Mr A showed no symptoms of such conditions when psychologically evaluated. He reported being depressed, forgetful and unable to focus, and showed symptoms usually associated with damage in the frontal lobe of the brain such as lack of persistence or impaired judgement. A CT scan showed low blood flow in several brain regions, including areas in the frontal lobe. These regions, although far from the bleed focus, are connected with it by neural pathways, which may have been the interrupted the interplay of neural systems that contribute to personality traits, researchers say. Mr. A was put on medication to treat his depression and said he felt cured two years later, but his generosity was unchanged. The full report was published on August 20 in the journal, Neurocase.

Maybe we should redefine what we call "Higher Thinking"
"Higher" than what?
Is generosity "Lower" thinking?

Pity the Minister for Finance doesn't get the same type of stroke:-)
But comments here that generosity is seen as a weakness these days are very true. The generous are regarded as fools. And indeed it's a very bad way for society to go.
This man has seen the truth as in a vision and wants to live life and do good by everybody before he dies, when all the money will then be useless. 2

We'll miss them when they're gone... from the grand old Villa to Di Canio at Sunderland and the Canaries' songs, why we'd like all these teams to stay up

With seven weekends of Barclays Premier League football remaining, there are still nine teams battling to avoid relegation. These include grand old clubs like Newcastle and Aston Villa, headline-grabbers Sunderland and QPR and possible one-season wonders Reading and Southampton.They all add something unique to the top flight and here, ahead of a crunch weekend at the bottom, Sportsmail assesses three things we will miss about each club if they go down. Premier League: bottom nine
12th Southampton – Games 31, Points 34 SOUTHAMPTON FIXTURES
Reading (a) – Saturday
West Ham (h) – April 13
Swansea (a) – April 20
West Brom (h) – April 27
Tottenham (a) – May 4
Sunderland (a) – May 12
Stoke (h) – May 19 1. Their slick passing football. Swansea have
rightly been heralded for their style but Saints have equal verve in attack. Adam Lallana, Jay Rodriguez, Gaston Ramirez and Rickie Lambert ping the ball about in the opposition's half and have sliced open some of the best defences.2. The raised eyebrows from Mauricio Pochettino’s translator when made to answer questions about previous manager Nigel Adkins. He positively bristled after the Chelsea game. 3. Ample and tasty food for deserving reporters. All right, this one is selfish but the pre-match curry in the press room deserves recognition. Manner from Heaven: Saints are passing their way to safety under Mauricio Pochettino
13th Stoke – Games 31, Points 34 STOKE FIXTURESAston Villa (h) – SaturdayManchester United (h) – April 14QPR (a) – April 20Norwich (h) - April 27Sunderland (a) – May 4Tottenham (h) – May 12Southampton (a) – May 19
1. Noise. The Britannia Stadium provides antidote to sanitised grounds around the land and is the loudest in England. Stoke’s home crowd has been recorded as measuring 122.6 decibels, noisier than a jumbo jet taking off. My my my Delilah.2. Tony Pulis’s cap. How many other managers are able to throw down an item of clothing in anger when a refereeing decision goes awry? 3. Goalless draws. Far too many teams think scoring goals is the key to winning matches and gaining points. What’s wrong with a good old 0-0? Stoke have had five this campaign alone. To cap it all: Tony Pulis and his Stoke side bring a certain atmosphere to the top flight
14th Norwich – Games 31, Points 34 NORWICH FIXTURESSwansea (h) – SaturdayArsenal (a) – April 13Reading (h) – April 20Stoke (a) – April 27Aston Villa (h) – May 4West Brom (h) – May 12Manchester City (a) – May 19
1. Witty chants. From asking Paul Lambert how green was his grass when Aston Villa visited Carrow Road to praising Spanish left-back Javier Garrido for eating paella and playing in 'yella', the Norwich faithful have an admirable song book.2. Chris Hughton. Did you know he recently trademarked ‘Nicest Man in Football’? 3. Ricky van Wolfswinkel. If Norwich go down, this fabulously-named and splendidly-talented striker will be lost to the Premier League. A big name: Van Wolfswinkel could light up the Premier League if Norwich survive
15th Newcastle – Games 31, Points 33 NEWCASTLE FIXTURES Fulham (h) – SundaySunderland (h) – April 13West Brom (a) – April 20Liverpool (h) – April 27West Ham (a) – May 4QPR (a) – May 12Arsenal (h) – May 19 1. Graham Carr’s scouting skills. Responsible for a conveyor belt of unknown talent coming to Newcastle from France, the 68-year-old impressed yet again when asked by Alan Pardew for quick action in January. Carr reckons Yohan Cabaye is his best find and the midfielder has been sparkling since his return from injury. 2. The ability to see Iceland (the supermarket, not the country) from the away seats high up at St James’ Park. Fans can plan what frozen food they should buy for the journey home.3. John Carver having tear-ups on the touchline. Anger Management: Newcastle No 2 John Carver (left, in white) goes ballistic against Wigan
16th Sunderland – Games 31, Points 31 SUNDERLAND FIXTURES Chelsea (a) – SundayNewcastle (a) – April 13Everton (h) – April 20Aston Villa (a) – April 27Stoke (h) – May 4Southampton (h) – May 12Tottenham (a) – May 19 1. Paolo Di Canio. You have been awake this week, right? 2. Simon Mignolet. Belgian footballers have lit up the Premier League this season and Sunderland’s goalkeeper is a fine representative. Nine clean sheets and more than a few spectacular saves make the 24-year-old a contender for PFA Team of the Year. A must for many Fantasy Football managers too.3. Paolo Di Canio anyone? All eyes on Paolo: Who doesn't want to see the trials and tribulations of Di Canio at Sunderland?
17th Wigan – Games 30, Points 30 WIGAN FIXTURES QPR (a) – SundayManchester City (a) – April 17West Ham (a) – April 20Tottenham (h) – April 27West Brom (a) – May 4Swansea (h) – May 7Arsenal (a) – May 12Aston Villa (h) – May 19 1. Obscure formations. Every match is an opportunity for Roberto Martinez to give a single-finger salute to the 4-4-2. Predominantly playing three at the back with a fluid front line, Wigan offer something different. Who knew Emmerson Boyce could become an able wing back? 2. Dave Whelan. Only a man so ingrained in football’s tribal loyalties would air his (patently incorrect) belief that Callum McManaman’s horror tackle on Massaido Haidara was ‘clean as a whistle’. But we need more of his passionate ilk at executive level.3. The Great Escapes. No matter how bad it seems, they always survive. Just. Tradition: It wouldn't be a Premier League season without a Wigan great escape
18th Aston Villa – Games 31, Points 30 ASTON VILLA FIXTURES Stoke (a) – SaturdayFulham (h) – April 13Manchester United (a) – April 22Sunderland (h) – April 27Norwich (a) – May 4Chelsea (h) – May 12Wigan (a) – May 19 1. Christian Benteke. It’s not just the goals but the disdain with which he treats opposition defenders. He sent Manchester United's Chris Smalling sprawling early in the season and was at it again against Liverpool with Glen Johnson particularly bruised.2. Paul Lambert. You have to admire his faith in youth and staunch resistance to give information on certain decisions. His memorable press conference in the wake of the Darren Bent fall out brought the line: ‘If I was going to lie to you, honestly, I would.’ 3. They're one of the traditional big clubs in England and, besides, the West Midlands needs more than just West Brom in the top flight Good Christian: Benteke's goals have given Villa a fighting chance of staying in the division
19th QPR – Games 31, Points 23 QPR FIXTURES Wigan (h) – SundayEverton (a) – April 13Stoke (h) – April 20Reading (a) – April 28Arsenal (h) – May 4Newcastle (h) – May 12Liverpool (a) – May 19 1. Tony Fernandes’s tweeting. The owner has consistently opened his heart on social media, even, it sometimes seems, to the detriment of his sanity. It provides a constant stream of insight. Even Chris Samba’s getting in on the act. Just don’t mention his £100,000-a-week wages.2. Harry Redknapp. Why would we want to lose someone who compared football agency to ‘gang warfare’, offers honest appraisal of his team’s failings, and stops for interviews out his car window? 3. Paying £55 for away tickets. Forking out more than half a ton to sit in a cramped, well-worn stand is a privilege, relieving supporters of money that would only have been frittered away on petrol or train fares. OK, maybe not... Salute for Harry: The Premier League would be a poorer place without the QPR manager and his quotes
20th Reading – Games 31, Points 23 READING FIXTURES Southampton (h) – SaturdayLiverpool (h) – April 13Norwich (a) – April 20QPR (h) – April 28Fulham (a) – May 4Manchester City (h) – May 12West Ham (a) – May 19 1. Late, late goals. The season began with an added-time equaliser from Adam Le Fondre at home to Stoke and he and his team-mates have consistently defied logic to pick up points since: 12 have been gained in the final 15 minutes of matches this season. Deliciously unpredictable even to the very end.2. The owner’s wife. We shall let pictures of Katsia Zingarevich speak for themselves. Ahem.3. The potential for manager Nigel Adkins to use interviews to recite poetry or announce he is off to ‘make love to my wife’. This actually happened. On camera. Leaving it late: Late goals have been a feature of this season, especially from Adam Le Fondre
Stunner: The Premier League is the only place for Katsia Zingarevich More...
We may push him towards relegation on Saturday, but Southampton fans will always cherish Adkins for rescuing our club
