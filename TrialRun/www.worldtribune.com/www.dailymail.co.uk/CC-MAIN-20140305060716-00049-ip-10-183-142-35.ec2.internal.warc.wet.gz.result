So sad and so unnecessary. Most have us have done things we shouldn't have, but playing drinking games is like playing Russian roulette.

Funny story, hope she receives her new Ipad. I wondered if it was a male, if they would have considered replacing or even reimburse the individual.

A bowl of mice krispies! Father-of-two's shock as he finds rodent in his cereal Author of reported comment:
Lynzey, Toronto-Canada
Date:
06/11/2012 05:06
Comment ID:
21273762
Comment:
Maybe the mouse was in the bowl to begin with and without really looking he dumped the krispies and milk on the poor dead mouse. They should also check his house for rodent poison and his eyesight - especially his peripheral sight ... brings to mind the TV commercial here for eye glasses ... the woman calls the cat inside for the night and a raccoon walks in and settles down. Most likely it was in the cereal.

Revealed: The full transcript of how Paul Lambert explains his treatment of Villa's �24million misfit striker Darren Bent

Comment:
The manager was recruited because of his football knowledge and track record of success - and is significantly more qualified to make the decision than a controversy seeking sports journalist. He doesn't even need to explain - Sir AF has made a career out of it.

When I was young and would have to change in the locker room at school, I'd always go to a bathroom stall. I would not shower at school either. I waited until I got home. Maybe that wasn't a bad idea after all.

Brazilian police have detained one man and were seeking two others in the killing of a referee who was gruesomely quartered and beheaded after fatally stabbing a player on the field during a match.Officer Valter Costa, who was heading the investigation into the June 30 slayings, said police have detained Luis Moraes Souza, 27, who is suspected of pummeling the referee over the head and smashing a bottle of cachaca sugarcane rum onto his face. Souza's brother, Francisco, is among the two still being sought, Costa said. Beheaded: 20-year-old soccer referee Octavio da Silva Catanhede Jordan was quartered and beheaded after fatally stabbing a player during a match last Sunday
Perpetrators: Police in Brazil have already arrested one man suspected of beheading the referee, but are still look for two others associated with the act
Fatally stabbed: Josenir dos Santos Abreu died on the way to the ambulance after being supposedly stabbed by referee Catanhede Jordan
The match took place June 30 at Pius XII stadium in Maranhao, northeastern Brazil. The slayings began after the 20-year-old referee, Otavio Jordao da Silva, expelled player Josemir Santos Abreu, 31, from an amateur match in the small town of Centro do Meio, in the northern state of Maranhao. Angered by the expulsion, Abreu threw
Silva to the ground. As he rose, Silva pulled a knife and stabbed Abreu
in the chest, Costa said, and the player died on the way to the hospital. Players and spectators then rushed Silva, tying him up by his arms and legs while Souza hit him over the head with a spike and then broke the bottle on his face. One of the suspects being sought, a man nicknamed 'Pirolo,' then took the knife that had been used to stab Abreu and stabbed the referee in the neck, said Costa. It was not immediately clear why Silva had been carrying the knife in the first place. Souza's brother Francisco then used a
sickle to cut off Silva's arms, legs and head, which he placed on a spike in the middle of the field, Costa said. He added that Francisco may have been on drugs at the time. The mob showed no mercy as they quartered and decapitated the referee and then placed his head on a stake. Arrested: Police in Maranhao have already brought into custody Luis Moraes Souza in relation to the beheading, but are on the lookout for two other men
Costa said violence was unusual in Centro de Meio, a remote rural community with little crime. He said those involved in the slayings were all from neighboring towns. While violent clashes between rival fans is common in Brazil, the brutality of the killings in Centro de Meio sent shockwaves through Brazil, which last month played host to the
Confederations Cup and is gearing up to host next year's World Cup soccer tournament. Paulo Storani, a professor and security expert who spent three decades in Rio's police forces, called the slayings 'an isolated incident' and said they don't reflect on Brazil's ability to ensure security at during the World Cup. 'It's something that's completely out
of the ordinary which took place in an isolated area of the poorest state in the country, an area where violence is very widespread,' said Storani. 'While it's true we are used to soccer violence in Brazil, this
is completely off the charts of what we usually see.'
A video shows the damage the mob did to Catanhede Jordan, but it is exceptionally graphic. Valter Costa, police chief of Santa Ines, released a statement about the investigation. 'Reports
of witnesses have indicated some people that were in place at the time of the fact,' he said. 'We will identify and hold accountable all those involved. A crime will never justify another. Actions like this do not collaborate with the legality of a state law.' Read more:

Keeping your goldfish in a tank which contains plants and sculptures could make them cleverer, according to new American research.Scientists at Penn State University, in Pennsylvania, discovered that fish benefit from being in ‘enriched environments’.They believe that their discovery could provide an insight into how to successfully repopulate our oceans and rivers. Fish kept in tanks with hiding places and floating artificial plants showed signs of improved brain function and could better navigate mazes than the those in a less exciting environment
Professor Victoria Braithwaite explained that currently a lot of fish that are bred in captivity do not survive once they are released into the wild.She said that, now, fisheries overcome this problem by breeding huge numbers of fish in the hope that some will survive. More...

Scientists discover a 52ft fish that would have weighed more than two double-decker buses and lived 160 million years ago
The professor believes that part of the reason so many of the fish die is that they are bred in ‘pretty boring’ tanks where there is always plenty of food and no predators meaning that they are totally unprepared for release.To test this hypothesis Braithwaite bred 30 salmon in two separate tanks.One contained plants and rocks which were regularly changed to ensure the fish did not become bored, while the other was empty. Conservation fish hatcheries are good at rearing lots of fish, but their survivability rate is low. Victoria Braithwaite, professor of fisheries and biology, Penn State, said that adding objects to make hatchery tanks more stimulating for the fish can make fish smarter and better adapted to survive in the wild
In contrast, Braithwaite said the hatchery world is homogenous: ‘The water flow is the same, you don't have to find your food and you don't have to avoid predators.’ Researchers discovered when fish were raised in the enriched tank, parts of their brains changed and they could escape from a maze quicker than fish raised in standard tanks
When the researchers placed the salmon in a maze, the fish raised in the enriched tanks made fewer mistakes when trying to escape the maze.The performance of the salmon from the enriched tank continued to improve with each trial, and they learned to solve the maze much faster than fish reared the standard way.The brains of the fish from the enriched tank were also different from the fish raised in the standard hatchery tanks, according to the researchers.They noted increased expressions of a gene in a region of the fish's brain that is associated with learning and memory, an indication of increased brain function and growth.Braithwaite has concluded that interacting with the environment can influence gene expression in the brain.‘If you want to make the environment more interesting for your fish, change things around a bit,’ she told The Times. ‘If you are a hobby aquarist, bring in some new ornaments for the tank.’ Share or comment on this article
