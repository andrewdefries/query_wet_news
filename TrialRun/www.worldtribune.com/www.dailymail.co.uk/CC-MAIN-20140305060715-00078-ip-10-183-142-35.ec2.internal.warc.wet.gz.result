There is no smoke without fire, managers are critisied for team slection players critisied for there performance, so what is wrong with critisising referees, every week we whatch players diving pulling at each others shirts what is the referees response nothing. I do not beleive that a forty year old referee can keep up with the modern day game of football. if you cannot take the heat get out of the kitchen.
