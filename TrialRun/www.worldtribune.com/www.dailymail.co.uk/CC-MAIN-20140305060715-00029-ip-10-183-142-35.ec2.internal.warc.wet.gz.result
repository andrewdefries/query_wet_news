The lush ponytail of my youth would have done a Californian cheerleader proud
Saturday night in a candlelit wine bar on a cobbled back street in York. A romantic evening at the end of a busy week.Adam puts down his glass and leans across the table to brush a stray eyelash from my cheek. A tender gesture, I think. He’ll pick it off and blow it gently from his fingers, making a wish for our future as he does so.‘Oh!’ he says, suddenly looking sheepish as I feel a sharp twinge.‘Mmm. It’s not an eyelash.’‘Well, what is it?’ I asked. ‘Fluff? Make-up?’Adam takes a large gulp of his Shiraz, clearly seeking Dutch courage (or oblivion?). He stares at me blankly, and I think I sense panic stirring somewhere inside him.‘Errr, it’s a hair. Quite a big one. Kind of browny-black. And it’s attached to your cheek,’ he tells me. There is a pause as he looks at me with . . . what? Pity? Contempt? I storm home, Adam silent in my slipstream, and make a beeline for my new five-times magnifying mirror and tweezers while he tries to make himself invisible, perhaps to spare me the humiliation of having to pluck out my first facial hair with an audience.This was a whole fortnight ago, which is a long time in menopause years. Since then my newest indignity is white, about a centimetre long and slightly curly. Strong as a steel guitar string and of similar girth, it snakes out of my right nostril and seems to be mocking me. More...

I assumed at first that it must have blown into my nose from an outside source: it was only when I tried to brush it away that I realised it was home-grown.
Menopause, it seems, is the time of The Great Hair Migration. No one warned me about this, but where it was thick (head, underarms, eyebrows etc), it’s thinning; and where it never grew (nose and ears so far), it now accumulates. Hairs from my head accumulate in the plughole every time I have a bath or showerThe lush ponytail of my youth would have done a Californian cheerleader proud: now my mane looks like one of those sad strips of half-hair worn by ageing rockers.Hairs from my head accumulate in the plughole every time I have a bath or shower, and I’m reduced to removing newly arrived nasal hair with a light-up shaving wand which makes my nostrils look like mine again — instead of a fat, retired colonel’s.The late, great Hollywood writer and director Nora Ephron observed: ‘At a certain age, legs get less hairy. My guess is that by the time I’m 80, I will be able to handle any offending hair on my legs with two plucks of an eyebrow tweezer.’I know how she feels. Nora also said that the ‘fair, downy and inoffensive’ moustache of her youth became a force majeure when the menopause arrived.‘It was no longer dormant, incipient and threatening; it was now just plain there,’ she wrote. That’s one indignity I have so far been spared — but it can only be a matter of time before my beauty routine involves a full shave. Share or comment on this article

Hahaha....yes..yes...I'm with you on this. Fortunately my hair was thick enough that it's still pretty good. But the wandering hairs that pop up seemingly overnight on my nose, chin, eyebrows (gotta love it when you get two matching attenae that suddenly pop up out of the brow arch), even a cleavage hair (!) are driving me crazy. I stand in front of a mirror, with an other mirror held in one hand and the tweezers in another, scanning to make sure I'm clear. And then, the next morning...there's another one! HOW can they grow so fast?

So funny. Yes what about the one solitary hair that you only notice under your chin when it is about 2cm long and can be pulled straight - but until then it wasn't there! It is only the one hair but it is so tough and wiry you could pull a barge with it! he he

Now in my 60's Ive sailed through my menopause by taking supplement like evening primrose along with cod liver oil, multivitamin, zinc, hair and nail capsules, vitamin d,and ginseng, Joints move well and life is good.

One hair, seriously one hair? I've been plucking hairs out of my chin since my mid thirties and I know plenty others who do the same, menopause or not. Not to mention hairs on the chest etc. to all those ladies that have the same, in my case, inherited hairiness, wouldn't you love to have had your first hair later in life!!!!

PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) also can cause excessive hair to grow on your face/body, since it causes your body to secrete excess androgen (male hormone); ironically it can also cause male pattern baldness in severe cases. It's the most common endocrine disorder among women. It also can cause metabolic syndrome. Your body can mitigate it better when you're young (depending on severity), so if you think you might have it stay on top of it.

Tell you what love, I'll have your facial hair outbreak (easily sorted out with some tweezers) and you can have my psoriasis outbreak which makes me look like I've got a bad case of fleas all over in addition to the chronic plaques I've had since I was 14. No?

You cannot compare one condition with another - they all cause some sort of suffering. Psoriasis, I know, is terrible as my brother has had to painfully live with it for the last 30 years and has had a terrible affect on his confidence. Countrylass, I wish you all the best.

James ‘Arg’ Argent is no stranger to yo-yo dieting and his ongoing struggle to maintain his weight has been publicly documented over the years that he has starred on The Only Way Is Essex.But now, the reality TV star is facing facts. With a BMI of 32 he is clinically obese and according to NHS guidelines needs to lose 5st 6lbs to reach a healthy weight. Taking drastic action to slim down, he is determined to lose weight and keep it off to prove his ‘haters’ wrong. Weight loss struggle: James Argent is on a mission to lose weight after hurtful Twitter comments about his size spurred him on
To kick-start his new fitness regime, he paid a visit to military-style bootcamp No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, where Made In Chelsea stars Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews have also lost weight, where he lost 8lbs in three days but he still wants - and needs - to lose more.The 26-year-old, who weighed in at 17st 7lbs on arrival, said he is determined to shed the pounds and become the new heartthrob of his ITV2 reality show, which returns later this month.

He said: 'I want to lose another two stone before the next series of TOWIE. I want to be the new heartthrob. I don't want to be skinny but I want to come back and look handsome again.'Arg aims to shed his excess weight in record time and it won’t be the first time he’s proved his doubters and critics wrong. Having fun, Arg? James hit No. 1 Bootcamp in Norfolk, which has also helped fellow reality TV stars Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews get into shape
In April 2012 he completed the Virgin London Marathon having only put in six weeks training. And as part of the Men’s Health Challenge last year, James lost a 2st in six weeks and 10 per cent of his body fat.In the past he has talked openly how hurtful he finds Twitter abuse about his weight. He said: 'What hurts is that I still get called the names every single day on Twitter. I don’t think people realise how much the criticism hurts sometimes. Lifestyle overhaul: Arg, pictured at his heaviest last year, is keen to lose weight and become the new TOWIE heartthrob
'The comedian Keith Lemon called me a fat b*****d recently. He said it in a funny way, but it still really upset me.'The reason Arg’s diets have failed in the past is simply down to his love of takeaways. Arg added: 'I just love food too much, I love takeaways.'
Favourite food: Arg has admitted to struggling with his weight because of his love of takeaways and unhealthy food
Nutritionist Nigel Penny warns Arg’s love of food and yo-yo weight loss is putting his health at serious risk. Nigel said: 'With a BMI of 32, James could be heading towards Type II Diabetes Mellitus and he is putting immense pressure on his heart. 'The takeaways he loves contain almost an average adult’s daily calorie recommendations in one meal.'They are high in salt and sugar and are often low in vitamins and minerals, including antioxidants, which help to protect against heart disease, insulin resistance and numerous cancers. Losing two stone in a matter of weeks is harmful to health.'Short-term effects include nausea, dizziness, headaches and long-term health issues could include osteoporosis. 'We should aim to lose no more than two pounds per week to give ourselves any chance of keeping off the weight. People who “yo-yo“ diet tend to put the weight back on incredibly quickly (and often put more on than before). 'On crash diets the body goes into a starvation protection mechanism, storing energy in an effort to protect itself if this ever happens again. Long way to go: While Arg has lost 8lbs, medics have warned there's more to lose in his quest to maintain a healthy lifestyle
'To maintain fat loss and avoid the negative health effects we should be realistic and encourage permanent and healthy lifestyle changes, rather than quick fixes. 'Our diets should be nutritionally balanced and including a variety of foods is essential in attempting to avoid deficiencies. We also need to consume the correct amount of calories for our age and sex, and for our individual activity levels.'Only time will tell if the only way is weight loss for Arg. As he was: Arg pictured, left, at a military style bootcamp this week and, right, when he first joined TOWIE in 2010

From glory to gory in 114 days: Golden duck for Cook leaves Ashes triumph at Oval a distant memory

It was just 114 days ago that Alastair Cook was holding the precious urn aloft in the gloom of The Oval, just over three months since a third successive series against Australia had been won and a fourth triumph was being keenly anticipated. How quickly those joyous Ashes scenes have turned to dust.What has happened here over three humiliating Tests has been a spectacular transformation in fortunes, with England having to face up to the harsh reality that they have been emphatically outplayed in every department.England may have held the Ashes since 2009 but no team have lost them quite as quickly after last winning them, back-to-back series proving that familiarity has bred not just contempt but a more defiant Australia.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Newman: England's hold on the Ashes hanging by a thread Looking glum: Alastair Cook (left) and Kevin Pietersen sit on the dressing room balcony after their dismissals Going... Pietersen (right) attempts to hit a six off Nathan Lyon
Going... The England batsman looks as the ball goes high into the sky Gone: But he doesn't get enough on it and Ryan Harris pouches the ball at long on
Nervous glance: Pietersen looks at the ball's trajectory but Lyon (right) does not look too confident it'll be caught
Lyon King: The Australia spinner celebrates with George Bailey after dismissing Pietersen Trying to pull it back: Kevin Pietersen attempts to stay positive as Australia home in on victory Positive mental attitude: Pietersen took the attack to Australia... but did it once too often
Mighty England have not so much fallen as crashed. Ben Stokes was a ray of light amid the gloom on the fourth day of the third Test, but the Ashes have been torn from their grasp before Christmas and the most chastening of inquests is about to begin.Everywhere England look they will see painful confirmation that Australia, such a shambles in India this year and at the start of the English summer, have out-thought, out-fought and almost bullied them with superior plans and intent.If England arrived in Australia thinking it would be the same story as last time they were here, when it was they who had the gameplan and personnel to trample all over Australia, they have been sadly mistaken.As Andrew Strauss, the captain who led them to their glorious away triumph three years ago, said at the weekend, England came here expecting to fight the same war as in 2010 but instead discovered their old enemy had re-grouped. Now Australia have outfoxed England, leaving them looking like a tired team in decline.It has been the rudest of awakenings. If there was a degree of complacency, maybe even arrogance, about the way England greeted last summer’s 3-0 triumph then it has come back to bite them. They need to take a good long, hard look at themselves before they can move on from this.Sunday was a microcosm of all that has gone wrong in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth — only more extreme. For the morning session of the fourth day was perhaps one of the worst England have known, certainly coming against an Australia side who stand poor comparison with the greats.From the moment Graeme Swann conceded 14 from the first over of the day it was carnage, 134 runs coming in just 17 overs with Shane Watson, who so seldom converts, helping himself to the easiest century he will score. Then, to compound the embarrassment, Jimmy Anderson, the leader of the England attack, was thumped for 28 by George Bailey — yes, George Bailey — to equal the record scored off one Test over. Michael Clarke declared with England’s spirits on the floor and they got lower immediately after.When Alastair Cook was bowled first ball of the England second innings, a golden duck in his 100th Test, it was possible to argue that — right there, right then — English cricket had never been lower. Paul Newman: England's hold on the Ashes hanging by a thread
What a start! Alastair Cook is bowled by Ryan Harris with the first ball of England's second innings Castled: Cook seems disbelieving after the ball evades his bat and crashes into the stumps Brilliant ball. Harris's delivery to Cook first up was nigh-on unplayable, as our Hawk-Eye graphic shows
Don't look back in anger: Cook looks back at his stumps, minus the bails, and then trudges off disconsolately Jumping for joy: Harris is delirious after bowling Cook with the first delivery of the innings
Jubilation: The Australian fielders go wild after the wicket makes it a dream start to England's second innings High fives: Cook leaves the field as Harris takes the acclaimAt least when they were whitewashed in 2006-07 they were playing one of the greatest teams. It could have been over by tea but thankfully England rallied, in the main through the promising and plucky Stokes, who finished in sight of England’s first century of the series. Compared to Australia’s seven, that is the most damning statistic of all. Wheels come off: Michael Carberry walks back to the pavilion after being trapped lbw by Shane Watson
Plumb: Watson's delivery to Carberry is hitting middle and the batsman is rightly given out Spectacular: Brad Haddin (left) dives to his right to take a superb catch to dismiss Joe Root
He's uprooted one: Mitchell Johnson celebrates after having Joe Root caught behind
Bad review: Root (centre) asks the third umpire to have a look at his dismissal but the decision is upheld Getting it right: Pietersen gets down the pitch and hits Lyon for six over long on The fallen: (from left) Root, Carberry, Cook and Pietersen on from the balcony after their dismissals
Close call: Root (left) was given not out after this lbw shout and it was upheld following an Australian review Appealing habit: The Australia slip cordon go up for lbw against Root (centre) Digging in: Root drives at the ball after coming in after Cook's very early dismissal Caught out: Brad Haddin attempts to take a ball that deviates off one of the huge cracks on the pitch
Watch out: Steve Smith and David Warner are obviously keen and collide while fielding Laughing it off: Smith and Warner share a chuckle after their fielding mishapBRUTAL BAILEYGeorge Bailey's assault on James Anderson equalled the highest number of runs scored in one Test over. Here is the top 10 28 G Bailey (Aus) off J Anderson (Eng) Perth 2013-1428 B Lara (WI) off R Peterson (SA) Johannesburg 2003-0427 Shahid Afridi (Pak) off Harbhajan Singh (Ind) Lahore 2005-0626 C McMillan (NZ) off Younis Khan (Pak) Hamilton 2000-0126 B Lara (WI) off Danish Kaneria (Pak) Multan 2006-0726 M Johnson (Aus) off P Harris (SA) Johannesburg 2008-0925 AB de Villiers (SA) off A McDonald (Aus) Cape Town 2008-0924 A Roberts (WI) off I Botham (Eng) Port-of-Spain 1980-8124 S Patil (Ind) off B Willis (Eng) Old Trafford 198224 I Botham (Eng) off D Stirling (NZ) The Oval 1986
Pietersen thrills and infuriates in equal measure and England will have to look at his dedication when the dust settles on this debacle for they will need proof that he really is committed to the next tour of South Africa.But they will be loath to throw out someone so talented without an adequate replacement and it should be said Ian Bell was equally culpable in trying to repeat the uppercut that also brought him six when he fell to Peter Siddle. It seems both England’s big guns misfired with their shot selection, so it would be unfair to single out Pietersen for that.The debate as to where England go from here can wait for another day but for now the sad truth is they are not a potentially great team any more.The senior batsmen are culpable for that and for England’s biggest problems here. And that is why scrutiny will rest on Kevin Pietersen, who will inevitably have his desire questioned after holing out again trying to hit Nathan Lyon for a second
straight six in consecutive overs. Instead
he gave away his fifth legside catch in six innings, which is simply not good enough for a batsman who aspires to greatness. Cruel cut: Ian Bell tries an upper cut but feathers the ball through to Haddin and is given out after a review
A good review: Siddle and his Australia team-mates roar after Bell's not out decision is overturned
Hitting out: Bell carves the ball through the off-side
Fully focused: Ian Bell keeps his eyes on the ball and drives it through the covers Nifty fifty: Bell raises his bat after scoring his half century
England on their knees: But Bell tried to stay positive and score when he could
On his marks: Bell looks as if he is ready to set off for a run during his innings Encouraging: Ben Stokes salutes his half century and ended the day on 72 not out
Giving them short shrift: Ben Stokes pulls the ball away
Fired-up Stokes: England's No 6 plays an expansive shot into the leg-side Steaming in: Johnson in his delivery stride as he attempts to bowl England out Declaration of intent: Clarke signals for the Australia batsmen to come in after they extended their lead to over 500 It's a wonderful life: George Bailey plays his shots with glorious abandon at the end of the Australia innings Shambles: Ian Bell (right) and James Anderson almost collide trying to take a catch - which Bell drops anyway Super effort: Tim Bresnan takes a stunning catch on the long-on boundary...
Unlucky: But Bresnan's momentum takes him backwards, and unfortunately he falls over the rope (below)
Light relief: Ben Stokes takes the congratulations after taking the wicket of Steve Smith
Roar talent: Shane Watson celebrates reaching his century after walloping the England attack around
On the front foot: Watson hit out on the fourth morning on the way to his hundred
Pushing the boundaries: There were plenty of fours and sixes in Watson's century
Now that's a crack! A ground staff member places his hand in a crack on the pitch before the start of play
