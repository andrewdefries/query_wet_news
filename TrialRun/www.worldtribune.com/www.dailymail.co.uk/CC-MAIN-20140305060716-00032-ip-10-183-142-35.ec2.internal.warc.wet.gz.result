People look into this far too much. There is nothing wrong with wanting to make you child the best version they can be. Me and my partner regularly let our 7 year old use fake tan. We have agreed that when she is 9 she can use our friends sunbed. If it makes her happy.

OMG, David!!! I can't get my jaw off the floor! You've got to be having a laugh, otherwise I feel for your baby girl and the Irresponsible parents she was born too :( Your email address:
