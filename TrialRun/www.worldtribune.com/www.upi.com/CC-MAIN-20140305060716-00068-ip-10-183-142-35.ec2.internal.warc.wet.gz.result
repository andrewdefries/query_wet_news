BEIJING, May 19 (UPI) -- China's National Bureau of Statistics said property prices fell in a majority of cities studied in April with declines in 46 of 70 urban centers.The decline in prices outpaced the study in March, which posted losses in 38 of 70 cities, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Saturday.A recent study pegged China's gross domestic product as growing 7.5 percent in 2012 with a slowdown partly attributed to lower property prices. Some analysts, the BBC said, consider 8 percent the breaking point. With 8 percent growth or above, China can continue to increase jobs, invest in infrastructure projects and support domestic demand. In so many words, with 8 percent GDP growth, China can continue to expand its middle class.In January through March 2012, China's GDP grew at an annual pace of 8.1 percent.

TUCSON, March 31 (UPI) -- Children with obstructive sleep apnea -- sleep-disordered breathing -- may have higher rates of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, U.S. researchers say.Lead author Michelle Perfect, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson, examined data from a longitudinal cohort, the Tucson Children's Assessment of Sleep Apnea Study. The longitudinal study prospectively examined Hispanic and Caucasian children age 6-11 to determine the prevalence and incidence of sleep-disordered breathing and its effects on neurobehavioral functioning. The study involved 263 children who completed an overnight sleep study and a neurobehavioral battery of assessments that included parent and youth reported rating scales.The study showed 23 children had incident sleep apnea that developed during the study period, and 21 children had persistent sleep apnea throughout the entire study. Another 41 children who initially had sleep apnea no longer had breathing problems during sleep at the five-year follow-up.Compared to youth who never had sleep-disordered breathing, children with sleep apnea were more likely to have parent-reported problems in the areas of hyperactivity, attention, disruptive behaviors, communication, social competency and self-care. Children with persistent sleep apnea also were seven times more likely to have parent-reported learning problems and three times more likely to have school grades of C or lower."School personnel should also consider the possibility that sleep disordered breathing contributes to difficulties with hyperactivity, learning and behavioral and emotional dysregulation in the classroom," Perfect said. The five-year study is scheduled to be published in the April issue of the journal Sleep.

LAKE FOREST, Ill., Nov. 26 (UPI) -- Chicago cornerback Nathan Vasher will miss the Bears' game against the Minnesota Vikings Sunday because of a fractured right hand and a right thumb injury.Vasher, 27, originally hurt the thumb in a Week 4 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Following surgery, he missed three games.On the team's Web site Wednesday night, Coach Lovie Smith said Vasher will "be out for a while," but declined to speculate about whether the Bears will place the 2004 fourth-round draft pick, who is in his fifth NFL season, on injured reserve."Right now all I can say is he's out. He's not playing this week," Smith said. "Whenever you have a fracture and you re-injure the same hand that you had a little trouble with, I mean you can go from there, so right now just know that he's out now."Vasher, who has been plagued by injuries the past two seasons, has 21 tackles and one interception this season.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 19 (UPI) -- Thirteen financial companies getting assistance under the Troubled Assets Relief Program owe $220 million in back taxes, U.S. Rep. John Lewis said Thursday.Lewis, D-Ga., who is chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, said he examined the 23 companies getting the biggest share of bailout money, The Washington Independent reported. He reported that two in the group are the biggest offenders, in debt to the Internal Revenue Service by more than $100 million each.Neil Barofsky, in charge of oversight of the TARP program, said that companies must certify that tax payments are up to date as a condition of getting aid.Lewis didn't release the names of the companies for legal reasons, The Hill reported. "We want to get to the bottom of what is going on here. The taxpayers deserve nothing less than the truth," he said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 6 (UPI) -- The U.S. Education Department announced Friday that two more states had been granted waivers from some provisions of the No Child Left Behind law.The department said Washington and Wisconsin received waivers from meeting the goal of making all students proficient in reading and math by 2014, raising to 26 the number of states relieved from meeting the centerpiece of the legislation passed during George W. Bush's presidency.Waiver requests are pending in 10 states and the District of Columbia, while 14 states have not applied for them. Because more than half of the states have received waivers, observers question whether the law is, in effect, nullified, The New York Times reported."The more waivers there are, the less there really is a law, right?" asked Andy Porter, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education. No Child Left Behind has been praised for forcing schools to be more accountable for educating minority students and students from poor families, but it also has been criticized for its reliance on test scores and for its rating system that classified so many schools as low performing it made the system meaningless. In exchange for the education waivers, schools and districts must pledge to set new targets for preparing students for post-secondary education and careers. They must also link school and teacher evaluations, in part, to student achievement on standardized tests and focus on troubled schools. Congress has tried unsuccessfully to reauthorize the education law during the last five years. Education Secretary Arne Duncan told the Times states receiving waivers would use a mix of indicators to evaluate teachers and schools. Education officials in the states that received waivers said they were relieved about not having to meet the 2014 deadline. "There was a general feeling that there were these goals that no one was ever going to meet," Kelli Gauthier, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Education, told the Times. "Now we have standards that are possible." A practical effect is that waivers remove many schools from being labeled as having failed to make what No Child Left Behind determined to be "adequate yearly progress" in getting more students to pass standardized tests. During the 2010-2011 school year, nearly half of the schools nationwide missed their targets. "To label an improving school a failure is the worst thing you can do," Duncan told the Times. "If they're doing the hard work to get better, it's like, 'Why are we killing ourselves to improve if we're going to get slapped in the face for it?'"

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 26 (UPI) -- Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said Sunday she hopes federal disaster aid to tornado victims in her state "will be very prompt."In an appearance on CBS's "Face the Nation," Fallin said the city of Moore -- where the brunt of the tornado struck -- was on the rebound with the help of scores of volunteers, but financial assistance from Washington was urgently needed to help pay for cleanup and repairs from the tornado, which killed at least 24 people."We know at different times in the past, money hasn't come always as quickly as it should," Fallin said. "So I'm hoping that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) will be very prompt in getting the relief here."Fallin said she would press the need for a streamlined process for federal aid when she met with President Barack Obama during his tour of Moore Sunday.She said volunteers on the ground are a valuable resource in the immediate aftermath of the storm but there was also a need for heavy equipment, skilled workers and other expertise that would require government assistance and money."I'm certain there will be some delays just because there's so much to do," Fallin said on CNN's "State of the Union." "Even finding the personnel, the people to do this stuff, will take a while. And how do you help people in the very long run?"

WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UPI) -- The number of volunteers across the United States was 62.6 million last year, or 25.4 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday.The volunteer rates for both men and women -- 22.2 percent and 28.4 percent -- declined for the year ending in September 2013. The bureau said women still volunteered at a higher rate than men across all age groups, educational levels and other major demographics.Volunteering data were collected through a supplement to the September 2013 Current Population Survey, a monthly survey of about 60,000 households that obtains information on employment and unemployment for the nation's civilian non-institutional population age 16 and over. The bureau said the volunteer rate in 2013 was the lowest it has been since the supplement was first administered in 2002.Broken down by age groups, the 35-to-44-year-old group was most likely to volunteer at 30.6 percent. The volunteer rate, was lowest among 20-to-24-year-olds at 18.5 percent. The data indicated the volunteer rate tapered as age increased for persons at least 45 years old.Volunteers spent a median of 50 hours on volunteer activities during the period from September 2012 to September 2013, the BLS said.

TUNIS, Tunisia, March 27 (UPI) -- Tens of thousands of activists from all over the world were gathered in Tunisia's capital Wednesday for the 2013 World Social Forum.This year marks the first time the four-day event, which grew out of anti-globalization protests in the late 1990s, is being held in an Arab country, Tunisia Live reported.The forum began with a Tuesday afternoon march by participants sporting banners, flags and even balloons as they chanted social justice slogans such as "down with dictatorships" and "freedom to the people.""The revolution is far from being over," said Danny from the Spanish 15-M Movement. "It hasn't achieved its goals yet. Tunisians must go on with the struggle."During the forum participants will attend hundreds of workshops, debates and concerts on the campus of Tunis El Manar University.High on the agenda are tax justice and campaign against debt, organizers said.

Feb. 8 (UPI) -- John Harrison is Khan! John Harrison isn't Khan!Speculation over the true nature of Benedict Cumberbatch's villainous role in Star Trek: Into Darkness has been wild, especially as director J.J. Abrams has kept a tight lid on the plot and details of the highly anticipated sequel.But when Entertainment Weekly released a of brand new stills from the movie, one of the photo captions in the back issue catalog labeled Cumberbatch as 'Khn'--as in Khan Noonien Singh, one of Star Trek canon's greatest baddies.Cumberbatch's character is supposedly named John Harrison, a former member of Starfleet who has turned against the good guys (including Captain Kirk and Spock, played by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, returning to their 2009 roles) and terrorizing the Earth with his secret agenda.But rumors have persisted that Harrison is just an alias, despite J.J. Abrams' insistence that Cumberbatch isn't Khan.So was the caption just a typo born of wishful thinking, or a major, giant plot-revealing slip-up by whoever typed it?We'll probably have to wait until May, when Star Trek: Into Darkness hits theaters, to know for sure.

Wiki
Rosanna Lauren Arquette (born August 10, 1959) is an American actress, film director, and producer.
Arquette was born in New York City, the daughter of Brenda Olivia "Mardi" (née Nowak), an actress, poet, theater operator, activist, acting teacher, and therapist, and Lewis Arquette, an actor and director. Her paternal grandfather was comedian Cliff Arquette. Her mother was Jewish, the daughter of a Holocaust refugee from Poland. Her father was a convert to Islam and a descendant of explorer Meriwether Lewis. Her siblings are actors Patricia, Alexis, Richmond, and David Arquette.
In 1963, Arquette's family moved to Chicago, where her father managed The Second City theater for several years. When she was eleven years old, her parents moved to a commune in Front Royal, Virginia. Arquette did not do well at school. In 1974, she hitchhiked across the country with three older teenagers, eventually going to San Francisco, where she worked at renaissance and Dickens fairs. Her professional theater debut was May 27, 1977, appearing in the Story Theatre Musical production of Ovid's The Metamorphoses at the Callboard Theatre on Melrose Place in Los Angeles.
