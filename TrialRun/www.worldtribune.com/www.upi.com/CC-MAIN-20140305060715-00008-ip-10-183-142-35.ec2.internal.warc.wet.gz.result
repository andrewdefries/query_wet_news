RIO DE JANEIRO, July 17 (UPI) -- Brazil is offering manufacturing and building firms special perks to diversify into defense production as part of its plan to capture a greater share of global military sales.Brazilian government investment and subsidies have pushed the nation's aviation and defense industries to the forefront of regional production in those sectors.Officials say Brazil's share of the global aviation, defense and security markets remains small and they want to see greater participation from the Brazilian industrial sector. The global defense market is estimated to exceed $1.5 trillion.Essentially the government of President Dilma Rousseff wants firms to diversify -- not switch -- production through the creation of subsidiaries and additional units, officials said.Generous credit terms and tax breaks are on offer to companies that follow the government's guidelines, the daily newspaper O Globo reported.Many of the incentives are covered in Law 12,958, passed in March, which set out special conditions and tax advantages.Aviation group Embraer is the lead producer of aircraft in Brazil and has moved swiftly from executive jets and small transport planes into manufacturing military aircraft, with large tactical transport aircraft next in line for development.Embraer's Super Tucano light aircraft has emerged as a serious competitor to rival firms in North America, Europe including Russia and East Asia.O Globo said several major Brazilian companies active in the areas of civil construction and engineering and infrastructure have already responded to the government. Besides Embraer, companies now busy diversifying include Andrade Gutierrez, Engevix, OAS, Odebrecht and Queiroz Galvao.Odebrecht is involved with a $4.8 billion Brazilian navy program to build a nuclear-powered submarine combining French technology with Brazilian parts.The Brazilian Association of the Defense and Security Materials Industry, also known as Abimde, estimates the country has the potential to earn at least $7 billion a year from defense exports by 2030.The Synergy group, the owner of Avianca and Taca airlines, and Camargo Correa are negotiating with potential foreign partners to enter the market, O Globo said.Other aviation and defense firms that are active in the field, Helibras, Avibras and CBC have built international connections and partnerships.Brazil's domestic aviation and defense market, on an upswing, is seen by government planners as a starting point for targeted marketing for new lines of defense hardware and software produced locally.The Brazilian armed forces are to spend $35 billion on procurement by 2015.

BOSTON, May 3 (UPI) -- Homegrown singers New Kids on the Block, Aerosmith and James Taylor will return to Boston with other artists for a concert benefiting marathon victim families.The event, titled "Boston Strong: An Evening of Support and Celebration," will be held at the TD Garden May 30, organizer Live Nation New England said Friday.Net proceeds from the concert will go to The One Fund Boston.The One Fund was started by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino "to help the people most affected by the tragic events that occurred in Boston on April 15," the fund's website says.Other "Boston Strong" performers are Jason Aldean, Boston, Jimmy Buffett, Dane Cook, Extreme, Godsmack, the J. Geils Band, Carole King and Steven Wright. Additional artists will be announced soon, organizers said. "Special guests" are planned."Like so many other proud Bostonians who have been extremely generous, we are honored to step up and do our part to help the victims and their families," NKOTB member Donnie Wahlberg said in a statement. "Hopefully this event will not only raise money, but spirits as well."Taylor said the event, listed online at AConcertForBoston.org, was "destined to be a true Boston landmark.""From the promoters to the sound and lights, to the performers and the Garden staff; everyone involved has responded from the heart in a spontaneous and simultaneous desire to be there, and to do what we can for the city we love," Taylor said."I am honored to be a part of it, and ... I can't wait."

GAINESVILLE, Fla., Jan. 4 (UPI) -- Burmese pythons in Florida can withstand exposure to salt water for long enough to expand their range through ocean and estuarine environments, researchers say.Hatchlings of the invasive snake species in the Florida Everglades may be able to survive in marine and estuarine environments such as bays, inlets and open seas, scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey said.The findings raise concerns the invasive species may invade nearby islands such as the Florida Keys, a USGS release said Wednesday."Because reptiles, in general, have poor salinity tolerance, it was hoped that salt water would naturally hinder pythons' ability to expand their range beyond the Everglades," USGS research ecologist Kristen Hars said. "Unfortunately, our results suggest salt water alone cannot act as a reliable barrier to the Everglades python population."The Everglades, the expansive and predominantly freshwater wetland, is home to the only known wild-breeding population of Burmese pythons in the United States."The fact that this study has ruled out one of the most hoped-for forms of physical barriers -- salt water -- as preventing the spread of invasive pythons in Florida, it puts even more onus on human action to prevent the spread of these damaging reptiles," USGS director Marcia McNutt said. "This study demonstrates the distinct possibility that pythons could spread to new suitable habitats one estuary at a time."

ARLINGTON, Texas, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Eddie Lacy's go-ahead, 1-yard touchdown run with 1:31 left Sunday completed the Green Bay Packers' wild comeback over Dallas, 37-36.The Packers were trailing by 23 points at halftime but outscored the Cowboys 34-10 the rest of way, including two touchdowns in the final 4 1/2 minutes to snatch an improbable victory.They were aided by two late interceptions tossed by Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo -- the first by Sam Shields set up Lacy's decisive score, and second by Tramon Williams effectively ended the game.Matt Flynn, again subbing for the injured Aaron Rodgers, completed 26-of-39 passes for 299 yards and four touchdowns with an interception as the Packers (7-6-1) stayed alive in the NFC North title hunt.Lacy finished with 171 total yards on 21 carries and four receptions.Romo went 29-for-48 for 358 passing yards with two touchdowns for Dallas (7-7), which remained one game behind Philadelphia in the NFC East.DeMarco Murray racked up 134 rushing yards with a score on 18 carries and added four catches for 19 yards.

NEW YORK, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Quarterbacks Johnny Manziel of Texas A&M, Collin Klein of Kansas State and Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o Monday were named Heisman Trophy finalists.The 2012 Heisman Trophy award is set be handed out Saturday in New York. Redshirt freshman Manziel turned in a fabulous year for the Aggies, passing for 3,418 yards and 24 touchdowns while also running for 19 scores en route to 1,181 rushing yards.No freshman has ever won the award, and neither has a linebacker, but Te'o, a senior, could be the first after intercepting seven passes and leading undefeated Notre Dame's stingy defense as it prepares to compete against Alabama for a national title in the Jan. 7 BCS Championship game.Senior signal-caller Klein, meanwhile, amassed 2,490 aerial yards and 15 touchdowns for the Wildcats, who will play Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl.Klein also ran for 22 touchdowns on his way to 890 rushing yards for the Big 12 Conference champs.

| License Photo	BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 14 (UPI) -- Mitt Romney won the Republican caucuses in Hawaii in his bid to be the party's presidential nominee, taking 45 percent of the vote.Earlier, Rick Santorum staked two primary wins in Mississippi and Alabama.With 99 percent of the vote counted in the Aloha State, Romney picked up 3,407 votes to Santorum's 1,930 votes (25 percent). U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was third with 1,425 votes (19 percent) and former House speaker Newt Gingrich won 848 votes (11 percent).Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, released a statement rather than make a speech after losing to Santorum and Gingrich in the Alabama and Mississippi GOP primaries.Romney aides told The New York Times the candidate was now unlikely to reach the 1,144 delegates needed to secure the Republican presidential nomination for at least two more months."We will be increasing our delegate count in a very substantial way after [Tuesday's primaries]. We are even closer to the nomination," Romney's statement said after he got 29 percent of the vote in Alabama and 30 percent in Mississippi.Romney also won the American Samoa Republican caucuses.Aides said Romney made a statement rather than a traditional election-night speech because he was in transit.Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, won with 35 percent in Alabama and 33 percent in Mississippi. Gingrich, a former U.S. House speaker from Georgia, garnered 29 percent and 31 percent, respectively, and Paul, a Texas congressman, tallied 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively."We did it again," Santorum told supporters in Lafayette, La., a state where the GOP will hold a primary March 24.He said he would campaign in Puerto Rico, Missouri and other states with upcoming primaries."We will compete everywhere," he said, calling on conservatives to "pull together."In a swipe at Romney, Santorum added: "For someone who thinks this race is inevitable, he spent a whole lot of money trying to be inevitable. Who would have ever thought in the age of media that we have in this country today that ordinary folks can defy the odds day in and day out?"Gingrich, who finished a close second in both states, noted he earned about as many delegates as his rivals and pledged to take his candidacy to the Republican National Convention in August."The elite media's efforts to convince the nation that Mitt Romney is inevitable just collapsed," Gingrich told a subdued crowd in Birmingham, Ala."If you're the front-runner and you keep coming in third, you're not much of a front-runner," he said.He separately told WZZK-FM, Birmingham: "The biggest bloc is saying Romney, but it's not a big enough bloc to be a majority. We now are beginning to think he will literally not be able to get the delegates to get the nomination."The Alabama and Mississippi primaries, along with the Hawaii and American Samoa caucuses, pushed the Republican presidential contest past the halfway mark.Voters in 27 states have now weighed in on the process of selecting delegates for the party's nominating convention.The race moves to the Missouri caucuses Saturday and the Illinois primary Tuesday.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 4 (UPI) -- President Obama Thursday thanked the men and women of the military and recognized the generations of Americans who worked to make the country what it is today.Using his weekly address to commemorate Independence Day, Obama acknowledged Americans -- from farmers to teachers to entrepreneurs -- and expressed gratitude for the service and sacrifice of the country's military."Hi everybody. I hope you all had a safe and happy Fourth of July, filled with parades, cookouts, fireworks and family reunions," Obama said in opening his greeting to the nation."We celebrated at the White House with a few hundred members of the military and their families. And we took a moment amid the festivities to remember what our Independence Day is all about -- what happened 237 years ago, and what it meant to the world. "On July 4th, 1776, a small band of patriots declared that we were a people created equal -- free to think and worship and live as we please. It was a declaration heard around the world -- that we were no longer colonists, we were Americans, and our destiny would not be determined for us; it would be determined by us."It was a bold and tremendously brave thing to do. It was also nearly unthinkable. At that time, kings and princes and emperors ruled the world. But those patriots were certain that a better way was possible. And to achieve it -- to win their freedom -- they were willing to lay it all on the line. Their lives. Their fortunes. Their sacred honor. "They fought a revolution. Few would have bet on our side to win. But for the first of many times to come, America proved the doubters wrong," the president said."And now, 237 years later, the United States -- this improbable nation -- is the greatest in the world. A land of liberty and opportunity. A global defender of peace and freedom. A beacon of hope to people everywhere who cherish those ideals. "Generations of Americans made our country what it is today -- farmers and teachers, engineers and laborers, entrepreneurs and elected leaders -- people from all walks of life, from all parts of the world, all pulling in the same direction. "And now we, the people, must make their task our own -- to live up to the words of that Declaration of Independence, and secure liberty and opportunity for our own children, and for future generations."I want to say a special word of thanks to the men and women of our military, who have played such a vital role in the story of our nation. You have defended us at home and abroad. And you have fought on our nation's behalf to make the world a better, safer place. People in scattered corners of the world are living in peace today, free to write their own futures, because of you. We are grateful for your service and your sacrifice, especially those still serving in harm's way and your families here at home."So, God bless you all. And may God bless the United States of America," Obama said.

MOSCOW, Feb. 23 (UPI) -- Russian officials said Saturday about 1,500 people sought psychological counseling after a giant meteor left a path of destruction in the Urals.The spectacular fireball lit up the sky Feb. 15 and was followed by a huge shock wave that blew out thousands of windows and caused scores of mostly minor injuries.The Emergency Situations Ministry said along with the psychological treatment given to rattled residents, another 44 people remained hospitalized with physical injuries.Work crews were still cleaning up the area, where nearly 10,000 windows had been replaced and more than 160 tons of broken glass hauled away by the end of the week.Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said the cleanup was pegged at 65 percent complete. About 11,000 people had been involved in the project.

July 31 (UPI) -- How times have changed. Bill Clinton may not have been sexting with Monica Lewinsky -- as Anthony Weiner did with Sydney Leathers and other women -- but he did receive a few romantic cassette recordings. The National Enquirer has reportedly obtained a "sex tape" that Lewinsky made for Clinton during "the height" of their relationship, 16 years after the affair led to a panoply of amazing "Saturday Night Live" sketches and eventually, the second presidential impeachment in American history. Radar Online has posted excerpts of the cassette recording in which Lewinsky's voice can supposedly be heard setting up a secret meeting with Clinton, who isn't on the tape.“I could take my clothes off and start… well… I know you wouldn’t enjoy that?" Lewinsky, then 24, tells the president. "I hope to see you later and I hope you will follow my script and do what I want.”The former intern then goes on to suggest a way that she and Clinton can meet in private without an official record. “Now the first thing that has to happen is that you need to pre-plan with [the president's secretary] Betty that you will leave the office at, I don't know, at 7, 7:30 so that everyone else who hates me that causes me lots of trouble goes home,” she says.Despite the comparisons, Lewinsky's doesn't appear to favor Weiner's brand of explicit sex talk. At one point, she suggests that a rendezvous with Clinton include dinner and a movie. “Maybe we could go over and watch a movie together and just have kind of, I don¹t know, boxed dinners or something like that,” she said. The Inquirer also has love letters from Lewinsky to Clinton, given to them by a "cleaner" her friends had hired for her. “First, I forgot to tell you that the Gingko Blowjoba, or whatever it’s called, was from me,” she writes in one. Comparisons to the Weiner scandal are inevitable, especially when Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, is a longtime Hillary Clinton aide. According to Radar, the National Enquirer posits that "the emergence of the tape could torpedo Hillary’s expected run for the White House."Over at Slate, however, David Weigel says the evidence suggests otherwise. Hillary's poll numbers soared when her husband's infidelity came to light. "You can always find a bulwark of opinion, usually on the right, indicting Hillary Clinton for the sex scandals around here. But the dominant opinion is always, always sympathy," Weigel writes. Follow @KateStan and @UPI on Twitter.
