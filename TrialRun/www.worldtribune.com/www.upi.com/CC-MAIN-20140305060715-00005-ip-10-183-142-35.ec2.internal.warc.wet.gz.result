CANBERRA, Australia, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- Northrop Grumman has delivered the trial proof of concept for an automated biometric information system for the Australian Department of Defense.The proof of concept was delivered to the Chief Information Officer Group, Australian Department of Defense, under a one-year contract.Northrop Grumman said the Australian system is modeled after the U.S. Department of Defense Automated Biometric Identification System, for which Northrop is prime contractor. The U.S. network-centric system is accessible worldwide and interfaces with other U.S. government agency data systems.The Australian system will be operated for six months to enable testing and refinement of analytical techniques for producing biometric intelligence that includes face, finger, iris and palm records, Northrop Grumman said in a statement.The trial results will help determine the needs for a future complete biometrics information management solution."This delivery is a key step in the development of a multi-modal biometric data repository for the Australian Department of Defense," Samuel Abbate, vice president of defense enterprise solutions for Northrop Grumman's Information Systems sector, said.During the trial, biometric data will be collected, stored, matched and processed in accordance with existing legislative frameworks, he said."ABIS will be an important element in Australian Defense Forces capability to ensure identity dominance and assurance in the theater," Abbate said.Northrop Grumman has been supporting Australian defense and civil programs for more than 20 years. It recently was awarded a contract to build a cyber test range for the University of New South Wales and Canberra campus at the Australian Defense Force Academy.The company recently acquired M5 Network Security, a Canberra provider of cybersecurity and secure mobile communications to Australian military and intelligence organizations.This month Australian Minister for Defense Stephen Smith also announced the appointment of former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to the governing council of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.The institute advises and informs debate around Australia's national and international strategic and security choices.Downer, who was leader of the Liberal Party in the early 1990s and foreign minister from 1996 to 2007, will serve a three-year term and replaces former Sen. Russell Trood whose term ends Dec. 31.Downer was recently appointed to board of Roy Hill Holdings, the company developing the $9 billion Roy Hill iron ore project in Western Australia, a report by The Australian newspaper said.The project was publicly criticized and slammed by unions for importing around 1,700 foreign workers during the construction phase, The Australian said.

DENVILLE, N.J., Dec. 23 (UPI) -- A New Jersey lawsuit alleges two Coldwell Banker real estate agents kept a house from selling so it could serve as a location for their "sexual relations."Richard and Sandra Weiner of Denville filed a state Superior Court lawsuit naming Coldwell Banker of Madison and real estate agents Robert Lindsay and Jeannemarie Phelan for breach of trust and fiduciary duties, The Record, Hackensack, N.J., reported Monday.The Weiners said Lindsay was hired to sell the couple's vacant home in Wayne."Instead, Lindsay and Phelan, through Lindsay's illegal and dishonest acts, used the Weiners' home as their play pad to have sexual relations in the Weiners' bedroom, among other places in the home," the suit states.Lindsay allegedly made an extra key to the home and "intentionally listed the house above market value to avoid Realtor traffic in the home while he and Phelan carried on their trysts.""Worst yet, all of Lindsay and Phelan's sexual escapades were recorded on security video cameras located in the Weiners' home," the lawsuit alleges.Lindsay and Phelan allegedly had sex in the home at least 10 times from Dec. 27, 2011, and Jan. 23, 2012.The Weiners are seeking compensatory damages for invasion of privacy, infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, trespass of land and other civil counts.Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage said Lindsay and Phelan are no longer contracting with the company.

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Scott Hartnell scored the winning goal during a first-period power play Saturday in a "chippy" game Philadelphia won 2-1 over the New York Islanders.Danny Briere got the Flyers' opening goal and Josh Bailey got the Islanders' lone tally in the second period.Ray Emery made 31 saves for Philadelphia, which has beaten the Islanders 14 times in a row at home. Dwayne Roloson had 30 stops for New York, which has lost four straight."It's always fun to score a goal, that is what hockey is about," Hartnell said. "Everyone was very emotional here today. It was kind of a chippy game. A lot of stuff after the whistle, but we got two points and that's what we needed."

ATLANTA, Aug. 30 (UPI) -- Freddie Freeman hit a two-run homer in the first Friday and Julio Teheran teamed with three relievers to protect the lead in Atlanta's 2-1 win over Miami.The Braves won their fifth in a row in a likely march to the National League East title. Atlanta's magic number for clinching the crown dwindled to 15 with a full month left to play.Freeman's homer came after Eliot Johnson had reached on one-out double off Jose Fernandez (10-6).Fernandez allowed just three hits and struck out eight over six innings, but the Marlins could not do enough damage against Teheran and the Atlanta bull pen.Teheran (11-7) surrendered four hits and struck out eight in 6 1/3 innings to win for the fourth time in six starts. Anthony Varvaro worked the final two innings to claim the first save of his career.Christian Yelich singled in the lone Miami run in the third. The Marlins have lost five in a row and nine out of 10.

NEW YORK, Jan. 28 (UPI) -- New York congressional House members called on President George Bush to increase funding for first responders to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.At a weekend news conference, Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler said Bush to should restart a proposed national processing center that was scrapped last month, the New York Sun reported Monday.The program would have consolidated funding of health programs for emergency workers who responded to hijacked aircraft attacks that felled the World Trade Center's two towers.Maloney referred to Bush's scheduled State of the Union address Monday night, but said she didn't expect any good news for emergency workers."The president will probably mention 9/11 on Monday, but he's unlikely to announce any aid for the heroes who rushed to New York from all around the country to save the lives of others," she said, at the Sunday news conference.Scores of workers have since been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and various respiratory ailments from working in the debris, the report said.

CHICAGO, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- A young man returned to Mexico by a Chicago-area hospital after a construction injury that paralyzed him from the neck down has died, officials say.Advocates say Quelino Ojeda Jimenez, 21, spent months in a small hospital in Mexico that did not have the facilities to care for a quadriplegic, the Chicago Tribune reported. He was transferred to the General Hospital of Juchitan a month before he died on New Year's Day, Jeromino Ramirez Luis, the new hospital's medical director, said. "He never even made it to his home," said Jesus Vargas, a friend in Chicago. "He was always in the hospital stuck to the machine that helped him breathe."Ojeda, who was working illegally in the United States, was treated at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., after a 20-foot fall paralyzed him. The hospital transferred him to Mexico three days before Christmas in 2010.He told the Tribune in an interview last year that he did not want the transfer but was unable to speak as he was being wheeled to an air ambulance.

EAST HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 24 (UPI) -- The FBI arrested four East Haven, Conn., police officers Tuesday accused of racially profiling and mistreating Latino residents, officials said.The New Haven Register reported the four officers were involved in the Feb. 19, 2009, arrest of the Rev. James Manship, who was videotaping officers taking license plates off the wall of My Country Store. Sgt. John Miller along with Officers Dennis Spaulding, David Cari and Jason Zullo were indicted by a grand jury Tuesday morning. A U.S. Justice Department release said more than 30 acts were cited in the indictment, including incidents of excessive force and arrest on false pretenses."At its core, this is an abuse of power case," Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said. "Police officers are supposed to protect and serve, and the indictment alleges that the officers abused their power, and then added insult to injury by intimidating witnesses and creating a climate of fear."

WASHINGTON, July 9 (UPI) -- An adviser to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., couldn't confirm a conservative publication's report that Rubio will sponsor a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks.Rubio hasn't contacted his office about sponsoring the legislation and was in his home state through Tuesday, the adviser told Politico.However, a July 2 story in the The Weekly Standard reported Rubio "agreed to be the lead sponsor of a Senate bill to ban abortion after an unborn child is 20 weeks old." The Weekly Standard article did not include any comments from Rubio or his office.When the adviser eventually talked to The Weekly Standard, the adviser "couldn't confirm" the story, Politico reported Monday."When I did talk to them, I told them the same thing I told everyone: '[Pro-life groups] have been asking since April,'" the adviser told Politico Monday.A similar nationwide ban passed the Republican-led House.Even if such an abortion bill is introduced, a leadership aide said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., doesn't intend to schedule the measure for floor action, Politico said. A committee hearing isn't likely, either.But abortion opponents said they think having Rubio's name attached to such legislation would be enough to focus national attention on the abortion controversy.Rubio, who wowed the Republican National Convention in 2012, has been mentioned as a 2016 GOP presidential nominee.If he does sponsor the abortion legislation, Rubio could earn back some of the goodwill he lost among conservatives angered by his role in the sweeping bipartisan immigration legislation that would, among other things, provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, Politico said.

| License Photo	GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba, April 12 (UPI) -- Tens of thousands of emails between Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detainees and their lawyers were wrongly turned over to the prosecution, it was revealed.The revelation prompted Col. Karen Mayberry, the chief military defense counsel, to order all defense attorneys to stop using Pentagon computer networks to send privileged or confidential information until security can be assured, The Washington Post reported Thursday.Army Col. James Pohl, the chief judge at Guantanamo, also ordered a two-month delay in pre-trial proceedings in the case against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. Defense attorneys for Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, and four co-defendants filed an emergency motion seeking a similar delay.Pre-trial hearings in both cases were to resume this month.The Post said the prosecution gained access to about 540,000 emails from defense teams, although it was unclear which cases were involved. A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment.Defense attorneys said prosecutors told them they stopped reading the emails as soon as they realized the missives contained confidential defense information, the Post said.The mishandling of the emails was detected when IT specialists were searching the government's computer system on behalf of prosecutors in a specific case."Is there any security for defense attorney information?" asked James Connell, representing Sept. 11 defendant Ali Abdul Aziz Ali. "This new disclosure is simply the latest in a series of revelations of courtroom monitoring, hidden surveillance devices and legal-bin searches."In February, a military lawyer acknowledged microphones were hidden in rooms used by defendants when they met with their attorneys. The military said the system was not used to eavesdrop and had been installed before defense lawyers used the rooms. The government said it removed the wiring. That same month, Pohl learned the soundproofed courtroom at Guantanamo Bay was wired with a "kill switch" that allowed an unknown government entity to cut the trials audio feed to the public gallery. Attorneys also complained recently that work files were lost when the Defense Department tried to upgrade its network for defense lawyers handling detainee cases in the Washington area, the Post said.Meanwhile a hunger strike among Guantanamo Bay detainees has widened, but attorneys for the prisoners and the military disagree about the number of participants. The Pentagon said Thursday 43 of the 166 detainees were on hunger strike, of whom 11 were being force-fed. Defense attorneys said the overwhelming majority of the more than 120 inmates in the base's Camps 5 and 6 were on the hunger strike.International Committee of the Red Cross President Peter Maurer told the Post Thursday the hunger strike arose from detainees' frustration over being held indefinitely without any further review.

Wiki
Mack Sennett (January 17, 1880 – November 5, 1960) was a Canadian-born American director and was known as the innovator of slapstick comedy in film. During his lifetime he was known at times as the "King of Comedy". His short "Wrestling Swordfish" was awarded the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1932 and he earned an Academy Honorary Award in 1937.
Born as Mikall (or Michael) Sinnott in Danville, Quebec, Canada, the son of Irish Catholic immigrant farmers. His father was a blacksmith in the small Eastern Townships village. When he was 17 years old his family moved to Connecticut.
The family lived for a time in Northampton, Massachusetts, where, according to his autobiography, Sennett first got the idea to go on stage after seeing a vaudeville show. He claimed that the most respected lawyer in town, Northampton mayor (and future President of the United States) Calvin Coolidge, as well as Sennett's own mother, tried to talk him out of his theatrical ambitions.
