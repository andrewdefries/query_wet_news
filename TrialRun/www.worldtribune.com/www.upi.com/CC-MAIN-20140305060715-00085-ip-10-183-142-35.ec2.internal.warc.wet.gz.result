BAAR, Switzerland, Sept. 5 (UPI) -- The Greek government expressed interest in the implementation of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline for Europe, the project company announced.Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos said the government was committed to TAP as part of the Southern Corridor of transit systems planned for Europe.TAP Managing Director Kjetil Tungland said the sentiment is a testament to the enduring partnerships with European and Greek parties."This is just a further step in the good and productive relationship TAP has had with the Greek government and the country's authorities throughout the project's development," he said in a statement.The BP-led consortium controlling operations at Shah Deniz has said the pipeline is one possible transit option for European consumers. TAP could move as much as 353 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year to the region through Greece, Albania and Italy.By next year, the BP-led group should decide between Nabucco West, a scaled-down version of the larger $10 billion project, and TAP as the conduit for Azeri natural gas.

So it's really just a matter of NBC pulling the trigger," the actress said. "They have to announce it by May 15 when the up-fronts happen, right? So we're all just waiting. We're really excited to come back, everybody wants to come back. I know Rainn does have his show, but he's going to come back to 'The Office' as well, so yeah, we're just waiting."

Today is Thursday, Oct. 25, the 298th day of 2007 with 67 to follow.The moon is waxing. The morning stars are Mercury, Venus, Mars and Saturn. The evening stars are Uranus, Neptune and Jupiter.Those born on this date are under the sign of Scorpio. They include British historian Thomas Macaulay in 1800; Austrian composer Johann Strauss in 1825; French composer Georges Bizet in 1838; artist Pablo Picasso in 1881; explorer Richard Byrd in 1888; country comedian Minnie Pearl in 1912; actors Tony Franciosa in 1928 and Marion Ross in 1928 (age 79); basketball coach Bobby Knight in 1940 (age 67); author Anne Tyler and pop singer Helen Reddy, both in 1941 (age 66); and violinist Midori in 1971 (age 36).On this date in history:In 1825, the Erie Canal, America's first man-made waterway, was opened, linking the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean via the Hudson River.In 1854, known to history as the Charge of the Light Brigade, 670 British cavalrymen fighting in the Crimean War attacked a heavily fortified Russian position and were wiped out.In 1881, Pablo Picasso, one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, was born in Malaga, Spain.In 1929, during the Teapot Dome scandal, Albert B. Fall, who served as U.S. President Warren G. Harding's interior secretary, was found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office, first individual convicted of a crime committed while a presidential cabinet member.In 1971, the United Nations admitted China as a member, ousting the Nationalist Chinese government of Taiwan.In 1983, U.S. troops, supported by six Caribbean nations, invaded the tiny, leftist-ruled island of Grenada. Nineteen Americans died in the fighting.In 1986, the International Red Cross ousted South African delegates from a Geneva meeting because of Pretoria's policy of apartheid. It was the first such ejection in the organization's 123 years.In 1993, Canadian voters rejected the Progressive Conservative party of Prime Minister Kim Campbell and gave the Liberal Party, led by Jean Chretien of Quebec, a firm majority in Parliament.In 1994, Susan Smith reported to police in Union, S.C., that her two young boys had been taken in a carjacking. Nine days later, she confessed she had rolled her car into a lake, drowning the children.In 2000, AT&T announced it would break itself into four separate businesses in a bid to renew investor support.In 2001, the U.S. Senate, by a 90-1 vote, approved a final package of anti-terror reforms designed to help law enforcement monitor, observe and detain suspected terrorists.In 2002, Democratic U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and seven others were killed in the crash of a small plane near the Eveleth-Virginia Municipal Airport, about 180 miles northeast of Minneapolis.In 2003, California wildfires, fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds, destroyed 60 homes near Los Angeles and threatened dense housing tracts.In 2004, at least 78 Muslim detainees suffocated or were crushed to death in southern Thailand after the police rounded up 1,300 people and packed them into trucks following a riot.Also in 2004, a top civilian at the U.S. Department of Defense Pentagon called for a federal investigation into how contracts in Iraq and the Balkans were awarded to the Halliburton company, formerly run by U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney.In 2005, civil rights icon Rosa Parks died in Detroit at age 92. Parks, an African-American woman, gave new impetus to the rights movement when in 1955 she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Ala., bus.Also in 2005, Iraq's draft constitution was reported approved by more than three-quarters of the voters in the Oct. 15 referendum.In 2006, U.S. President George Bush said he would authorize higher troops levels in Iraq if U.S. generals ask for it.Also in 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples "must be afforded on equal terms the same rights and benefits enjoyed by opposite-sex couples."A thought for the day: Pablo Picasso said, "I am only an entertainer who has understood his time."

PETERCHURCH, England, July 30 (UPI) -- British archaeologists say they've unearthed two 6,000-year-old Neolithic "halls of the dead" in the Herefordshire countryside.Researchers from the University of Manchester and Herefordshire Council made the find on Dorstone Hill, near Peterchurch, where the remains of the halls were found within prehistoric burial mounds, a university release reported Tuesday.The timber buildings may have been "halls of the dead" similar to others from the Neolithic period found in Europe, where bodies would have been placed before being moved to nearby chambered tombs, the archaeologists said.The buildings, probably used by entire communities, were deliberately burnt down after they were constructed and their remains incorporated into the two burial mounds, they said.The researchers said they've uncovered structural timbers in carbonized form, post holes showing the positions of uprights, and the burnt remains of stakes forming internal partitions."The mound tells us quite a bit about the people who built it: they sought to memorialize the idea of their community represented by the dwelling," Manchester archaeology Professor Julian Thomas said."And by turning it into part of the landscape, it becomes a permanent reminder for generations to come.""Just think of how the burning of the hall could have been seen for miles around, in the large expanse of what is now the border country between England and Wales," he said.Archaeologists have long speculated a close relationship existed between houses and tombs in Neolithic Europe, and that "houses of the dead" amounted to symbolic representations of the "houses of the living.""This find is of huge significance to our understanding of prehistoric life -- so we're absolutely delighted," Thomas said.

There was a changing of the guard in thoroughbred racing during the weekend, with some emotional retirements and new stars shining.Notable among the retirements was Shackleford, who won his final start at Churchill Downs amid no shortage of emotion.And notable among the breakthroughs was Gentildonna, already a star in Japan but now poised to hit the international stage after upsetting Orfevre in Sunday's Japan Cup in Tokyo.There was a lot going on so let's take a look:Gentildonna dealt Orfevre his second straight heartbreaking defeat Sunday, catching the favorite in the final jumps to win the Group 1 Japan Cup by the narrowest of margins.The defeat was devastatingly similar to Orfevre's second-place finish in last month's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, when he was caught at the wire by French filly Solemia after lugging in badly with the race seemingly won.This time, the stewards took a long look at bumping in the stretch run before approving the victory by the winner of the Japanese Filly Triple Crown. They did impose a two-day suspension on winning jockey Yasunari Iwata for allowing the contact."It was a fierce battle," Iwata said. "I wish it could have been a bit cleaner. I'm sorry we bumped Orfevre and, yes, she did have a 4-kilo weight advantage. But she really deserves congratulations for her magnificent effort."It was the seventh win in nine starts for Gentildonna and trainer Sei Ishizaka now is looking overseas for new targets. "I would say the Arc is a possibility and so is running in Dubai or the United States," he said. "I am thinking long-term and not necessarily next year."The foreigners in this year's Japan Cup made little impression. Red Cadeaux got home eighth, Jakkalberry 11th and Mount Athos 12th. Sri Putra finished last of the 17 starters.Churchill DownsShackleford went out on top, leading all the way to a 1-length win over Take Charge Indy in his final career start in Friday's $400,000, Grade I Clark Handicap. With Jesus Castanon in the irons, the 4-year-old Forestry colt ran 9 furlongs on the fast main track in 1:49.12 and never let Take Charge Indy pose more than a minor threat. Bourbon Courage made a courageous late run from well back to finish third, another head back. Shackleford heads off to the breeding shed with six wins, five seconds and a third from 20 career starts. He finished fourth in last year's Kentucky Derby, won the Preakness and finished fifth in the Belmont. "That's the way he's supposed to leave," said winning trainer Dale Romans, who picked up his ninth Grade I win of the year. Castanon, who rode Shackleford for the first time since he won the Grade II Churchill Downs on Derby Day, added, "He was very impressive today. That's 'Shack' at his best. I know what he likes to do and I put him in a spot where he wanted to be. He finished up strong. Once they let me open up, I knew he was going to last. I could have gone around again and I don't think they would have gotten me."Uncaptured and Frac Daddy dueled down the long stretch in Saturday's $150,000, Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club for 2-year-olds before Uncaptured put his nose in front under the wire. Dewey Square was third, 1 1/4 lengths farther in arrears. Uncaptured, an Ontario-bred Lion Heart colt, ran 1 1/16 miles on a fast track in 1:44.97 with Miguel Mena up for trainer Mark Casse. Uncaptured became just the seventh horse to win by both the Iroquois and the Kentucky Jockey Club during the fall meet under the twin spires and thus becomes an early candidate for next spring's Kentucky Derby. "Honestly, at the eighth pole I thought he was beat," Casse said. "Very seldom does a 2-year-old get headed, be on the inside and come back and win. He showed his gameness today. Good horses can win when things don't go perfect." Frac Daddy's trainer, Ken McPeek, also spoke optimistically about his colt's future. "I really trained him conservatively coming into it," McPeek said. "I could have trained him a little harder and, in hindsight, I think maybe I would have won it. But I'm thrilled with his race. I think if you give him two or three more starts under his belt, I don't think Uncaptured wants anything to do with him." They likely will settle that dispute on some track or the other before too many more months elapse.Seaneen Girl came widest of all into the stretch in Saturday's $150,000, Grade II Golden Rod Stakes for 2-year-old fillies and went on to post a 31-1 upset win, besting the favorite Gal About Town, by a half length. It was 5 more lengths back to Liberated in third. Seaneen Girl, a Spring at Last filly, finished 1 1/16 miles in 1:44.95 with Mena up for trainer Bernie Flint, who bought her in Canada because he liked her breeding. "I know one thing," Flint said after the win. "If she stays the way she is, she'll be fine. She'll come on in the spring really good. We're going to go down to Louisiana and I'll probably get a whole van just for her."Keep Up wound up the fall meeting's stakes schedule with a 30-1 upset win in Sunday's $100,000, Grade III River City Handicap. Racing from near the back of the 12-horse field, the 5-year-old son of Unbridled's Song outfinished odds-on favorite Boisterous to win by a half length with 50-1 chance Skyring completing a nice getaway trifecta. Keep Up, with Miguel Mena up, ran the 9 furlongs on firm turf and under the lights in 1:48.05.Salty Strike got through between rivals in the stretch in Friday's $65,000 Dream Supreme Stakes for fillies and mares and held on to win by a half length over Cheery. Salty Strike, a 4-year-old Smart Strike filly, ran 6 furlongs on a fast track in 1:09.74 with Victor Lebron up.AqueductOwner Mike Repole and trainer Todd Pletcher took three of the four rich stakes on Saturday's card and jockey Ramon Dominguez also won three, including two for Repole and Pletcher.Stay Thirsty and Groupie Doll hooked up in a stretch duel in Saturday's $350,000, Grade I Cigar Mile with Stay Thirsty prevailing by a nose. Coil finished third, 2 lengths farther back. Stay Thirsty, a 4-year-old Bernardini colt, got home in 1:35.47 under Dominguez. Groupie Doll, dominant against fellow fillies and mares, brushed slightly with her rival in deep stretch but ran to the wire and did no harm to her chances for divisional honors at this year's Eclipse Awards. Winner of last year's Travers, Stay Thirsty had been winless in four earlier starts this year and now is targeted for the breeding shed. Pletcher noted the colt "was successful at 2 and won races like the Jim Dandy and Travers at 3, and the breeders love milers. He proved today he can be versatile enough to do all of those things. It was a huge win for him." Groupie Doll's trainer, Buff Bradley, said his filly "ran a hell of a race" in her first start against males. I'm glad we came. I knew Stay Thirsty was coming at us. He ran a great race, too. I thought she ran her race and ran very well."Dance Card led from the early going in Saturday's $350,000, Grade I Gazelle Stakes for 3-year-old fillies and won by 4 lengths. Sea Island was second at a big price and Puerto Rican star My Wandy's Girl finished third. Dance Card, a Kentucky-bred Tapit filly, ran 9 furlongs on a fast track in 1:50.39 with Dominguez up for trainer Kiaran McLaughlin. The Godolphin filly now has won four straight races after finishing second in her debut. The Gazelle was her first graded stakes try. "She's a beautiful animal with high cruising speed, and she can pick it up whenever you ask her," Dominguez said. "She was perfect through the whole race, and down the lane she wanted to drift out some, but she keeps running. She's special, and I love her."Pletcher, Dominguez and Repole won another in Saturday's $250,000, Grade II Remsen Stakes for 2-year-olds as Overanalyze prevailed in the middle of a three-horse stretch battle sandwich. At the wire, Overanalyze was a nose better than the late-running Normandy Invasion. The pacesetter, Delhomme, settled for third. Overanalyze, a Dixie Union colt, ran 9 furlongs in 1:50.13. He now has three win in five starts -- one in each of the major New York tracks. He also finished fourth in the Grade II Three Chimneys Hopeful at Saratoga and third in the Grade III Iroquois Stakes at Churchill Downs. The Repole stable's Unlimited Budget led all the way to a 1 1/4-length score in Saturday's $250,000, Grade II Demoiselle Stakes. Emollient, who stumbled at the start, finished second. Giant Cat's Eye and Flash Forward completed the order of finish. Unlimited Budget, a Florida-bred Street Sense filly, ran the 9 furlongs in 1:52.16 with John Velazquez in the irons. She remains undefeated in two starts. "We'll take her down to Florida and won't race her until February," Repole said, "give her all the time she needs and get her ready for a nice 3-year-old campaign."Nefertini got to the lead in the lane and then battled through the final furlong in Friday's $200,000, Grade II Go for Wand Handicap before prevailing by a neck over Willet. Hard Life finished third. R Gypsy Gold and the odds-on favorite, Fantasy of Flight, completed the order of finish. Nefertini, a 4-year-old Empire Maker filly, ran the mile on a fast track in 1:35.80. Winning rider Alan Garcia said his instructions were to stay close to the lead. At the end, he said, "She didn't want to get beat." Notacaatbutallama tracked the pace in Friday's $80,000 Super Mario Stakes for 2-year-olds, swung out entering the stretch and drove clear, winning by 3 1/2 lengths as the odds-on favorite. James Jingle came from last of seven to get place money and Sunlover finished third Notacatbutallama, a New York-bred Harlan's Holiday colt, ran 1 1/16 miles on firm turf in 1:44.31 with John Velazquez in the irons for trainer Todd Pletcher and owner Mike Repole.Hollywood ParkBetter Lucky stalked the pace in Sunday's $250,000, Grade I Matriarch Stakes for fillies and mares, put in the first run at the lead in the stretch and beat late-closing Tiz Flirtatious for a 1-length victory at 35-1 odds. Summer Soiree finished third. Better Lucky, a 3-year-old Ghostzapper filly owned by Godolphin Racing and trained by Tom Albertrani, got the mile on firm turf in 1:34.18 with Eddie Castro up. "I was surprised at her odds," Godolphin racing manager Jimmy Bell said. "She's really blossomed. This is certainly a great way to cap off this year. She's very game, tries and is dead honest. I would think she'd surely be racing next year."Unbridled Command rallied from near the back of the field to win Sunday's $250,000, Grade I Hollywood Derby by 1 1/2 lengths over the favorite, Grandeur. Lucky Chappy finished third. Unbridled Command, a New York-bred Master Command colt, ran 1 1/4 miles on firm turf in 2:01.07 with Javier Castellano riding. It was his fifth straight win. Winning trainer Tom Bush said Unbridled Command will ship to Florida and will be pointed to a race at Gulfstream Park. "He likes to track on the turns," Bush said. "He just matures from race to race to race. I couldn't dream of a horse developing any nicer than this horse. He's really gotten special."Data Link rallied three-wide into the stretch in Friday's $250,000 Citation Handicap and quickly shot clear, winning off by 2 1/4 lengths over the early leader and favorite, Ultimate Eagle. Doubles Partner finished third. Data Link, a 4-year-old War Front colt, ran 1 1/16 miles on firm turf in 1:41.00 with Garrett Gomez up for trainer Shug McGaughey. It was his seventh win in 15 career starts with the wins coming at five different tracks. "We're very pleased with the way he ran today and very pleased with the way Garrett Gomez rode him," McGaughey said by telephone. "They went slow early, but then they picked it up and Gomez was in a great spot ... . We think he's a pretty good little horse. He'll ship Monday and we'll see how he's doing."Den's Legacy got to the lead in the stretch in Saturday's $100,000, Grade III Generous Stakes for 2-year-olds and held off Rising Legend's late run to win by a half length. Shining Copper finished third. Den's Legacy, a Florida-bred Medaglia d'Oro colt, ran the mile on firm turf in 1:36.32 with Garrett Gomez riding for trainer Bob Baffert. "I knew this horse would go through wherever I pointed him," Gomez said. "He's pretty handy that way. He was hitting the hole that wasn't there yet. When the hole opened up, I told him, 'Let's go." I just didn't want him to go from zero to 100 as fast as I could. I kind of pushed the gas pedal down and he kicked on." Baffert assistant Mike Marlow said, "I would guess Bob will keep him on the grass. That's his best, I think."Travesura was on the lead shortly after the start in Saturday's $100,000, Grade III Miesque Stakes for 2-year-old fillies and prevailed by a half length over late-running Pussycat Lips. Flashy Ways finished third and the favorite, Premier Steps, settled for sixth with a dull effort. Travesura, a Kentucky-bred Limehouse filly, got the mile on firm going in 1:37.01 under Tyler Baze. Winning trainer Jeff Mullins said he started thinking about the Miesque after Travesura won a maiden event by 3 3/4 lengths at Santa Anita in early October. "There really wasn't anything else for her," he said. "It was our only option. My only worry was the distance. I know she can run and I knew she'd like the grass. It just took forever to get her there."Kindle was quickly on the lead in Friday's $65,000 Cool Air Stakes for fillies and mares and won off by 2 3/4 lengths over Broken Dreams. Schiaparelli finished third. Kindle, a 4-year-old daughter of Indian Charlie, got 6 furlongs over firm turf in 1:08.38 with Edwin Maldonado aboard.Calder Race CourseTwilight Eclipse got home first in a parade of upsets in Saturday's $150,000, Grade II W. L. McKnight Handicap, rallying late to beat Mucho Mas Macho by 1 3/4 lengths. Vertiformer finished third and the favorite, Ioya Bigtime, finished fourth after leading for much of the race. Forte Dei Marmi, who skipped a trip to Hong Kong for this race, finished last of eight. Twilight Eclipse, a 3-year-old Purim gelding, ran the 1 1/2 miles on firm turf in 2:26.71 with Manoel Cruz up, winning for the third time in just six lifetime starts. "We had such good position through the whole race and I just waited," Cruz said. "And when I wanted to go, he just took off for me and he finished so, so strong."Ducduc rallied to just catch pacesetting Csaba on the wire in Saturday's $100,000, Grade III Fred W. Hooper Handicap, producing a dead heat for win and place. It was 7 1/4 lengths back to Fair Whit in third. Ducduc and Casba ran 1 1/8 miles on a fast track in 1:52.93. Luis Saez was up on Csaba, a 3-year-old Kitten's Joy colt and Orlando Bocachica had the mount on Ducduc, a 6-year-old son of Langfuhr.WoodbineMagic Broomstick survived an awkward start in Saturday's $150,000, Grade III Bessarabian Stakes for fillies and mares, rallied through the stretch and outfinished Wyomia to win by 1 1/4 lengths. Atlantic Hurricane finished third. Magic Broomstick, a 6-year-old More Than Ready mare, ran the 7 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:22.29 under Emma-Jayne Wilson. The race was her last as she heads off to her new career in the breeding shed.Bear Tough Tiger won a duel with Bear No Joke in Sunday's $150,000, Grade III Kennedy Road Stakes, scoring by a neck. Something Extra finished third. Bear Tough Tiger, a 4-year-old Roar of the Tiger gelding, ran 6 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:08.77 for jockey Justin Stein. Bear Tough Tiger came into the race off a third-place finish in the Grade I Nearctic stakes. "He's doing better all the time," said winning trainer Reade Baker. "He'll go a little farther. We might try the Mr. Prospector Stakes at Gulfstream before the year's over and see if we can get a Sovereign Award or two."Laurel ParkShe's All Scat led most of the way in Saturday's $100,000 Gin Talking Stakes for 2-year-old fillies, was headed by Ek Haseena late but fought back to win by 1 1/2 lengths over that rival. Disco Barbie danced in third as the favorite. She's All Scat, a Scat Daddy miss, ran 7 furlongs on a fast track in 1:26.18 with Jose Caraballo in the irons. She now has won two of four career starts. "She's a game little filly," Caraballo said. "She'll go to the front, she'll come off the pace. Today, when a horse came up to me and passed me, the filly came running again and she did it."Fair GroundsUnlatch surged to the lead late in Friday's $75,000 Woodchopper Stakes for 3-year-olds, opened a daylight lead and held on to win by a neck over Aldous Snow. Ikon Ike finished third. Unlatch, a Horse Chestnut gelding, got the mile on firm turf in 1:37.96 with Jamie Theriot in the irons.Zapper Belle outfinished Francisca in Saturday's $75,000 Pago Hop Stakes for 3-year-old fillies, winning by 3/4 of a length with Cat Lore getting show money. Zapper Belle, a Ghostzapper filly, ran the "about" 1 mile on firm turf in 1:39.36 with Leandro Goncalves up.Zia ParkAfrican Rose led from the early going in Saturday's $55,000 Zia Park Distaff and got home first by 1 1/4 lengths over the odds-on favorite, Raucous Lady. Pyrite On My Mind finished third. African Rose, a 3-year-old, Florida-bred Bwana Charlie filly, ran 6 furlongs on a fast track in 1:09.88 with Isaias Enriquez up.Remington ParkOkie Ride mowed down his rivals in the stretch run of Friday's $50,000 Silver Goblin Stakes for Oklahoma-breds and went on to win by 3 3/4 length over Fifth Date. Ferdie Mac finished third. Okie Ride, a 5-year-old Candy Ride gelding, completed 6 1/2 furlongs on a fast track in 1:16.62 with Luis Quinonez up.Beulah ParkStartin' Something went to the front, plodded along on the pace and easily won Saturday's $50,000 Bobbie Bricker Memorial Handicap for Ohio-bred fillies and mares. At the wire, the 4-year-old Musical Dreamer filly was 5 3/4 lengths ahead of runner-up Sheza Runaway Star and finished the 1 1/16 miles in 1:48.63 for jockey Hector Rosario Jr.

LLANELLI, Wales, Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Four teens in south Wales were critically burned when a butane-powered curling iron heater exploded as they prepped for Christmas parties.The blaze from the explosion late Monday collapsed a bedroom roof where the girls were reportedly trying out hairstyles for holiday parties using hair-curling tongs heated by a small butane canister, The Times of London said. The girls rushed from the home with clothes on fire."Looking at the state of the building, it is amazing that anyone got out alive," local councilor John Jenkins told The Times. "It's a Christmas miracle that the girls survived."Sisters Anya and Kira Evans and two friends, Nadine Fardon and Kimberly Patterson, all ages 14 or 15, were undergoing treatment at a hospital burn unit.

NEW ORLEANS, March 25 (UPI) -- Strategists said Rick Santorum appeared to pick up supporters from Newt Gingrich in the Louisiana Republican primary, but his win may not be enough.The former Pennsylvania senator won decidedly in Louisiana Saturday, earning 49 percent of the vote to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's 27 percent, CNN reported Sunday. Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich finished with 16 percent and Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, won 6 percent of votes.Romney was the front-runner in the Republican presidential campaign with 563 delegates going into the Louisiana primary compared to Santorum's 251. Santorum will pick up at least eight more delegates in his Saturday win.Gingrich was expected to have a stronger showing in Louisiana as the only candidate with ties to the state -- he graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans, The (New Orleans) Times-Picayune said."Too many people just felt like Newt wasn't a contender, and so a lot of people who would have voted for Newt just didn't," said James Farwell, a New Orleans consultant and former top adviser to Gingrich when he served as speaker. "The media approached it as a two-man race and Gingrich simply didn't have the resources in Louisiana to rewrite the script. It's too bad: No candidate for president has ever had a stronger connection to New Orleans than Newt."Despite Santorum picking up Gingrich's lagging supporters, Bruce Haynes, a GOP strategist, told The Times-Picayune he needs to win bigger next time to have a shot at the Republican nomination."Santorum can't just win, he has to win big. He's the one who needs to 'shake up' this race. Another ho-hum win in the South doesn't cut it. He's on a political bridge to nowhere and is running out of time to change destinations," he said.

| License Photo	Now that the U.S. election is over, talk of repealing President Obama's signature healthcare reform law can be relegated to the rhetorical scrap heap -- although House Speaker John Boehner last week raised the possibility of including talk of modification in the discussions over the so-called fiscal cliff.Republicans took to referring to the Affordable Care Act pejoratively as "Obamacare." But Obama co-opted the term: "I have become fond of this term, Obamacare," Obama said during the first debate against GOP presidential challenger Mitt Romney, whose Massachusetts healthcare initiative served as a model for the federal law.Deadlines are looming for states to set up healthcare exchanges mandated by the ACA. They can either run their own, opt for the federal government to take care of it or set up a partnership with the feds. Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia were undecided as of Friday and have until Dec. 14 to decide whether to go it alone or until Feb. 15 to decide whether to partner with the Department of Health and Human Services or let the federal government run the whole shebang.Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio are planning to go into partnership with the federal government. Seventeen states -- Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming -- so far have opted to relinquish control.That leaves only 17 states opting for the do-it-yourself approach so far.Enrollment begins in October 2013 with the system to be running full bore by Jan. 1, 2014. Those who refuse to buy insurance will face a penalty -- the administration called it a fine but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it a tax, constitutional, but a tax all the same.After the states decide what to do, insurance companies will have to inform them about policy offerings. Insurers can't make any decisions, however, until HHS lays out all the rules.Among the reasons cited most often for implementing the ACA is the provision limiting insurers' ability to reject people with pre-existing conditions. Currently insurers' rejection options are limited under group policies but consumers have no such protections on the individual market."The Affordable Care Act prohibits new plans in the individual market from imposing pre-existing condition exclusions on children under the age of 19, and the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act prohibits insurers from excluding a pre-existing condition because of genetic information in the absence of a diagnosis of a condition," the Kaiser Family Foundation says.Currently, states deal differently with the issue."Eighteen states use the objective standard definition for pre-existing conditions, under which the insurer can only refuse to pay for treatment of a condition if the patient received an actual diagnosis or treatment for the condition prior to coverage. Twenty-four states allow insurers to use the broader prudent person standard. Eight states and the District of Columbia have not adopted any definition of pre-existing condition," Kaiser notes."Thanks to the health care law, no one will be discriminated against because of a pre-existing condition," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last week.The law also limits insurers' ability to vary premiums based on age and other factors, a rule lauded by AARP."The proposed rules prohibiting insurance companies from raising premiums based on pre-existing conditions, health status, gender or occupation are other critical steps forward in guaranteeing access to affordable coverage," said Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond.Boehner, meanwhile, in an op-ed piece last week in the Cincinnati Enquirer argued that for all the good the ACA does, it drives up costs, adding to the debt and hindering economic recovery."The tactics of our repeal efforts will have to change," Boehner, R-Ohio, said in reference to the dozens of House votes in the last two years to repeal the law that went nowhere in the Democrat-led Senate."The president's health care law adds a massive, expensive, unworkable government program at a time when our national debt already exceeds the size of our country's entire economy. We can't afford it, and we can't afford to leave it intact. That's why I've been clear that the law has to stay on the table as both parties discuss ways to solve our nation's massive debt challenge. ..."Over the past couple of years, I have noted there are essentially three major routes to repeal of the president's law: the courts, the presidential election process and the congressional oversight process. With two of those three routes having come up short, the third and final one becomes more important than ever."

BASRA, Iraq, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- Shiite demonstrators supporting the Iraqi government came out in force in southern Iraq, countering protests in mainly Sunni provinces, a report said.The Islamic Ahlul Bayt News Agency, based in London, said tens of thousands of pro-government and Shiite demonstrators in Basra, Diwaniyah, Karbala and other provinces carried banners supporting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and denouncing sectarian division.Protesters chanted "No to sectarianism, no to dividing Iraq," the news agency said.At a demonstration in Diwaniya province, south of Baghdad, Shiite cleric Qassim al-Moussawi told protesters "America and Israel" were behind the crisis over sectarianism, as well as "Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar." "We reject dividing Iraq into three regions, Sunni, Shiite and Kurd," he said.

DHAKA, Bangladesh, May 2 (UPI) -- The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association named a committee to investigate the collapse of Rana Plaza in which at least 400 people died.The organization's second vice president, Mannan Kochi, said the report will be issued 10 days after the panel has been convened, although some questioned the organization's effectiveness in ensuring workers' safety, The Daily Star reported Wednesday."We hope the reasons for the building's collapse will be identified in the probe report," BGMEA President Atiqul Islam said.Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin, who led the BGMEA when the Tazreen Fashions fire broke out last November, said the trade body must take some blame for not acting forcefully when the industry faces a disaster."We are sincere but we lack expertise and we have to depend on experts," Mohiuddin told The Daily Star.Islam said a day before the building's collapse on April 24, the trade body asked owners of the five factories not to operate inside Rana Plaza in Savar until experts checked the building. However, factory owners resumed operation without informing the association, he said.Labor leaders said they are frustrated with the BGMEA's failure to ensure worker safety in garment factories, the Daily Star said."It seems that workers have no rights and dignity in Bangladesh," said Nazma Akhter, president of Sommilito Garments Sramik Federation."[The BGMEA] formed committees just for show. None of its reports has ever blamed factory owners for any accidents," Akhter said.Syed Sultan Uddin Ahmmed, assistant executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Labor Studies, said new laws were needed to ensure workers' safety in clothing factories."Special laws and speedy trial tribunals are required to try those responsible for the deaths of workers," Ahmmed said.

CAPE BRETON, Nova Scotia, Nov. 13 (UPI) -- A whale trapped in a shallow cove in Nova Scotia was being towed to open waters Wednesday, a wildlife official said."Things are looking good at this time," David Jennings of the provincial Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. during the afternoon.The whale became stranded in Jersey Cove in Cape Breton during the morning, he said.Andrew Reid of the Marine Animal Response Society, who hadn't seen the whale for himself, said descriptions of the marine mammal led him to believe it's a minke whale, a relatively small species common in Atlantic waters.Reid suspected the whale may have come in close to shore to feed only to be trapped by the ebbing tidewater.
