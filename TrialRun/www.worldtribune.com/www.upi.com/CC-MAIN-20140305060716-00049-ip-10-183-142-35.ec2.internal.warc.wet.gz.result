COLLEGE STATION, Texas, Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Well-designed employee wellness programs can yield savings of as much as $6 for each dollar spent on the health intervention, U.S. researchers say.Researchers led by Leonard L. Berry of Texas A&M University, Ann M. Mirabito of Baylor University and William B. Baun of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, say since Johnson & Johnson incorporated a wellness program in 1995, the percentage of its employees who smoke dropped by more than two-thirds.Those with high-blood pressure or who are physically inactive declined by more than one-half and the wellness program saved $250 million on healthcare costs from 2002 to 2008 -- or a return of $2.71 for every dollar spent, the researchers say.Richard Milani and Carl Lavie said one study involved a random sample of 185 workers and their spouses, who were not heart patients but received heart exercise training from an expert team.Of those diagnosed at high heart risk -- for body fat, blood pressure, anxiety and other measures -- 57 percent were converted to low-risk status by the end of a six-month period. In addition, the company's medical claim costs had declined by $1,421 per participant, compared to the costs from the previous year.In addition, a well-designed employee wellness program can translate into reduced employee turnover.The findings are scheduled to be published in the December issue of the Harvard Business Review.

LOS ANGELES, April 10 (UPI) -- The important thing to know about "Anger Management," the sure-fire comedy hit starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, is that it's more of a Sandler movie than a Nicholson movie. As a human being and role model, Nicholson isn't much, but for more than 30 years he has been a trustworthy brand name indicating movies with smart, strong scripts. "Anger Management," however, is definitely a Sandler project, with his usual entourage of enablers filling assignments up and down the credit list. For example, "Anger Management" uses the same editor Sandler also employed for "Mr. Deeds" and "Little Nicky," which might explain why the comic timing in the actual movie isn't as crisp as in its ubiquitous TV commercials. The screenplay is aimed a little higher on the IQ charts than the typical Sandler contraption, but well below Nicholson's average.Sandler's character is unjustly arrested and sentenced to take Nicholson's anger management workshop. Nicholson insists upon moving into Sandler's apartment and driving him mad by acting like a sketch comedian doing Jack Nicholson.This is a can't-miss set up. Much great comedy, from Lewis Carroll through Evelyn Waugh, is based on subjecting a humble innocent like Sandler to a world of self-assured lunatics like Nicholson.Neither actor stretches. Sandler plays a milder version of The Adam Sandler Character. Here's he's an office drone with self-esteem problems, rather than his full-blown defective but loveable man-child. Just as the aging Robert De Niro has taken to playing De Niro! in an ever-growing series of comedies, Nicholson's portrayal of a psychotic psychologist self-parodies the legend of Nicholson the wild man.Jack objects to the breakfast poor Sandler cooks him (as in "Five Easy Pieces"), smashes a car window with a baseball bat (as the real Jack did in 1994 a few blocks from my house, except he actually used a 2-iron and the driver was still in the car), and horns in on Sandler's girlfriend, played by Marisa Tomei."Anger Management" is not precision-guided humor, however, but instead uses the human wave approach. Sandler's minions keep dispatching into the struggle battalions of the funny (John Turturro as a pop-eyed maniac who hasn't been right in the head since he got back from the war ... in Grenada; Woody Harrelson and his mighty jaw as history's ugliest transvestite; and Luis Guzman, the Puerto Rican Danny DeVito, as a sort of human potbellied pig) and the unfunny (cameos by Rudy Giuliani, Bobby Knight, and Roger Clemens). It's not pretty -- lots of jokes misfire -- but eventually "Anger Management" pounds out quite a few laughs.In general, having non-actor celebrities play themselves turns out to be more of a distraction than an attraction. For example, the HBO sports agent show "Arli$$" has delivered some of the most ruthless comedy in television history, but because it insists upon having famous jocks woodenly read a few lines in each episode, it has exposed itself to be slammed by the same critics who rave over the inferior "Sex and the City."Unfortunately, "Anger Management" ultimately tries to explain Nicholson's behavior. The most reasonable answer -- because he's Jack, and Jack is too cool to be bound by any standards of human decency or rationality -- isn't cuddly enough, so we winds up being informed that the preceding 90 minutes was all a charade cooked up between Tomei and Nicholson to get Sandler to uncork the rage bottled up within him and act like Jack.Normally, I don't give away endings, but that is so groaningly awful that you need to be forewarned not to let it ruin the rest of "Anger Management" for you.After seeing the film, I was surprised to discover that it's rated PG-13. Evidently, its original R-rating was lowered on appeal. Studios used to market R-rated films to children, and theaters would obligingly sell them the tickets. After the angry congressional hearings into this in 2000, head Hollywood lobbyist Jack Valenti organized a voluntary crackdown.Despite predictions of doom, this turned out to be the best thing to happen to the industry economically since the talkies. Just as Michael Medved has been predicting for a decade, R-rated movies were exposed as financially illogical. Last year, none of the top 20 movies was R-rated, yet box office revenues jumped 25 percent from 2000 to 2002.Unfortunately, the PG-13 category, which accounted for 13 of the top 20, has expanded into an overly broad catchall. These days, the G rating only applies to movies that wouldn't scare preschoolers, and PG is mostly for "Harry Potter"-type films aimed at elementary school students. That leaves PG-13 as the all-purpose rating, but it's losing any meaning to parents as the studios try to squeeze naturally R-rated films into it. Further, lots of parents don't know there's a difference between PG and PG-13.Therefore, Valenti should introduce a new level between PG-13 and R called R-13.

BEIJING, Dec. 31 (UPI) -- The first bird-watching database in China, from five years of observations, shows species moving to higher latitudes and elevations, researchers said.Writing in the journal Chinese Science Bulletin, researchers at Tsinghua University said such trends of bird distribution have garnered a great amount of attention with growing concern about climate change, since birds are one of the most sensitive indicators of ecosystem health.Recent studies have analyzed the impact of human activities on bird distribution and their response to climate change, but to date there had been had been no geographic distribution database of birds for analysis in China, the researchers said.Tsinghua University researcher Xueyan Li and her collaborators analyzed 30,936 bird-watching records from 2003 to 2007 to create the China Bird Watching Database.The database includes four critically endangered species, 11 endangered species and 44 vulnerable species in China, the researchers said.Of the species listed, 109 were observed moving outside their normal distributions from 2003 to 2007, showing a trend of moving to high latitude and high elevation regions, evidence of ecological response to climate change, the researchers said.

| License Photo	MOORE, Okla., May 23 (UPI) -- Residents of tornado-devastated Moore, Okla., have been allowed to return to their neighborhoods in what officials said were the first steps toward rebuilding.With the search for bodies and survivors completed, people lined up at dozens of checkpoints to await the signal they could begin restoring and cleaning up what was left of their homes, the Tulsa World reported Thursday.Dump trucks had begun at dawn to tote off tons of debris and crews labored to clear roads and restore utilities.Once residents were allowed back in the neighborhoods, a woman rushed to her kitchen and found $5,500 in cash she had hidden in a bag of hash browns in her freezer, the World reported. Other families searched for mortgage and insurance papers so they could apply for federal emergency assistance.More than 33,000 people have been displaced.Rebuilding efforts were cut short Thursday as rain pounded Moore, raising warnings about flash floods and severe thunderstorms, CNN reported.The 24 people who died in Moore and two killed by storms in Shawnee are to be remembered Sunday at a public memorial and prayer service at the First Baptist Church of Moore, which Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin will attend. That same day, U.S. President Barack Obama is to tour the area, the White House announced.A Tulsa couple on Wednesday presented the American Red Cross a check for more than $111,000, representing the sales of "Love for Oklahoma" necklaces they had designed in the hours following the tornado, The Oklahoman reported Thursday.The jewelry designers sold 2,500 of the $48 silver necklaces with a bronze pendant in the shape of Oklahoma within 24 hours of posting them online.

CAIRO, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- Egyptian Nubians say they are hoping to form a political party that will work to counter what they feel is neglect and marginalization of the ethnic minority.The Nubian Nile Party is in the process of collecting the 1,000 signatures required to form a political party, Ahram Online reported Thrusday.The party would be open to Egyptians of all ethnicities but spokesman Adel Moussa said its agenda would focus on issues important to Nubians."We have deep roots in Egypt," he said. "We reject those who question our Egyptian identity and commitment to Egypt." Nubians represent an estimated 3 million of Egypt's population of 87 million.About 50,000 Nubians were forced to relocate when the Aswan Dam was built on their land in the 1960s and many have complained they were never compensated by the state.Activists said last year that Nubians were not adequately represented in the constituent assembly, which drafted Egypt's new constitution.

| License Photo	Feb. 13 (UPI) -- O.J. Simpson may not be free to play football anymore, but that won't stop him from watching the sport's biggest event with his buddies on TV.The ex-football star, who is serving a 33-year sentence for kidnapping and armed robbery and was famously acquitted of his double murder in 1995, purchased a television for his cell at Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada and invited his friends in to watch the Super Bowl.According to the New York Post, Simpson was already popular--and the party couldn't have hurt.“If you have the money, you can buy a TV at the inmate store and put it in your cell,” Simpson's friend Noman Pardo told the Post. “He’s like the Godfather of the prison now.”Pardo, a producer, is trying to sell Unpromotable, a movie about his efforts to rehabilitate Simpson's public image.There's no official word whom Simpson, 65, rooted for, but he ended his NFL career with two seasons on the 49ers. He will be eligible for parole for the first time in 2017.

Jeffrey C. Halpern (born May 3, 1976) is an American professional ice hockey player who is currently playing for the Montreal Canadiens.
After graduating from Princeton University, Halpern began his NHL career in the 1999–2000 NHL season for the Washington Capitals. He played in 79 games, scoring 18 goals with 11 assists, and was +21. He was the first member of the Capitals to come from the Washington, D.C. area. Halpern first attended Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, which did not have a hockey team. In order to pursue his dreams as a hockey player, Halpern transferred to and later graduated from St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) where he was roommates with future Bachelorette winner Ian McKee.
The 2003–04 NHL season was his highest-scoring season to date as he finished with 19 goals and 27 assists in 79 games.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
