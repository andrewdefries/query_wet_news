HANOI, Vietnam, June 28 (UPI) -- Vietnam's central bank has devalued currency by 1 percent and cut interest rates, saying the moves would improve the balance of payments and spur the economy.The announcement by the State Bank of Vietnam devalued the dong to 21,036 to the U.S. dollar, effective Friday, from the previous exchange rate of 20,828 to a dollar.The bank said the currency adjustment is aimed at improving the balance of payments and increasing foreign exchange reserves, and at boosting exports, the Vietnam News Agency reported.The central bank said short-term lending rates for priority sectors, including agriculture, exports, high-tech businesses and small and medium enterprises would be cut to 9 percent from 10 percent. The bank also cut the dong deposit rate cap to 7 percent from 7.5 percent.The bank said the adjustments were made "to more accurately reflect the supply and demand of foreign currency in the market" and to "create stability" for the foreign-exchange market.Vietnam News said the country's inflation has come down from almost 23 per cent in August 2011 to 6.5 percent, bringing the embattled economy closer to achieving a growth rate of 5.3 percent this year.

MANAMA, Bahrain, Dec. 16 (UPI) -- U.S. policy regarding the Middle East has always been controversial to say the least, and when the U.S. secretary of defense delivers a major policy speech in the Middle East, it is certain to raise controversy. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates this past weekend addressed a conference organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies on security in the Gulf region, where he discussed three issues of immediate concern to U.S. allies in the region.Gates touched on Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. He also touched on optimism, pessimism, honesty and reality. His presentation coincided with a new international poll released by WorldPublicOpinion.org in which 21,740 respondents were questioned regarding Washington's approach to the Middle East and the Muslim world. The poll found the United States to be "largely disrespectful" of Muslims and gave U.S. foreign policy poor grades. The general perception is that Washington's support for democracy is seen as selective and "limited to cases where the government is cooperative with the U.S." On Iraq, Gates was highly upbeat regarding its future. At the same time he was rather pessimistic when it came to relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. And he was honestly down to earth regarding Afghanistan. As to the question of loyalty, the comprehensive poll of 21 countries puts into question just who are really Washington's friends -- and who are its fair-weather friends -- in the Middle East. While uncovering widespread opposition to the United States maintaining naval bases in the Gulf, the poll gives the United States poor grades in its dealings with the Muslim world. In Bahrain Gates offered an optimistic vision of Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011. His critics, however, said his description was overly simplistic, overly optimistic, and painted an unrealistically rosy picture of an uncertain future. Gates, who gave the opening remarks on the situation in the Middle East at the fifth Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain, said Iraq was at the "dawn of a new era."Just hours before he spoke, a massive car bomb had killed 55 people. Saadoun al-Dulaimi, a former Iraqi defense minister, told me the previous day that he believed mayhem and chaos would engulf Iraq "15 minutes after American troops pull out of the country." The irony here is that Dulaimi is a moderate and a secular. He runs the Baghdad-based Center for Research and Strategic Studies, which he founded in 2003 upon his return from exile in London. His center conducted the majority of the opinion polls in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion of the country -- polls that have demonstrated mounting dissatisfaction with the continued occupation of Iraq by U.S. forces. Yet despite his criticism of the Coalition Provisional Authority, he fears the departure of American forces will precipitate greater violence in the country.Speaking of polls, this is just in:The result of this poll should have Washington reassess the question of who its friends really are: Of the 21 nations polled, 14 oppose the notion of the United States maintaining bases in the Gulf, and three are divided. Interestingly, Egypt, a supposed U.S. ally and recipient of generous U.S. financial aid, came in first in opposing U.S. naval bases in the Gulf with 91 percent, just slightly ahead of the Palestinian Territories, at 90 percent. Turkey, a NATO member and U.S. ally, scored 77 percent, while Jordan, another friend of the United States and recipient of U.S. aid, came in at 76 percent.The United States scored good points in Nigeria, where 60 percent -- including 54 percent of Nigerian Muslims -- support having U.S. bases in the Gulf, and Kenya at 53 percent. The notion also received low points among European allies, with Germany (52 percent) and a plurality in Italy (43 percent to 31 percent). Publics remain divided in Britain (43 percent positive, 39 percent negative) and France (41 percent positive, 43 percent negative). "What is striking is that a major purpose of U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf is to ensure the flow of oil to U.S. allies, but in no case do the publics in these countries express majority support for the U.S. having forces there," said Steven Kull, director of WorldPublicOpinion.org. What is more striking is that the United States itself receives only about 10 percent of its oil supply from the Persian Gulf. The view that "the U.S. purposely tries to humiliate the Islamic world" is endorsed by majorities in three Islamic countries -- Iran (64 percent), Egypt (56 percent) and Pakistan (52 percent).After listening to Gates accuse Iran of "meddling in the affairs of other countries," a Swiss diplomat turned to me and said that part of the United States' problem was its failure to understand that Iran also has major security concerns. "Is U.S. involvement in the region not also meddling in other people's affairs?" asked the Swiss.The poll found that in both Muslim and Western countries there is a widespread perception that the United States does not unequivocally support democracy in Muslim countries. This question was asked to seven Muslim publics and five Western publics. In no nation does a majority think the United States favors democracy unconditionally; on average only 15 percent hold this view. Fifty percent think instead that "the U.S. favors democracy in Muslim countries, but only if the government is cooperative with the U.S." And finally we mentioned honesty. Talking about Afghanistan, Gates said: "There is no doubt that it is a tough fight in Afghanistan," where he said the U.S.-led coalition was fighting "a ruthless and resilient enemy.""Everyone's ticket out of Afghanistan," said Gates, "is a strong Afghan army." But he added, closing on a note of reality, "We have to recognize that we are going to be in Afghanistan for a very long time."--(Claude Salhani is editor of the Middle East Times.)

View Larger Map	ALBANY, N.Y., Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Two Albany, N.Y., colleges are creating a bachelor's degree program for students with autism spectrum disorder, college officials say. Officials at Sage Colleges and Excelsior College created the Sage Achieve degree, an online program for students with autism spectrum disorder, which can be customized to meet a student's particular disabilities, but it is as rigorous as any other degree, the Albany Times Union reports. Susan Scrimshaw, of Sage College, says the degree includes one-on-one mentoring and will lead to a bachelor's degree in liberal studies with a full 120 credits and an emphasis in computer science.Excelsior College developed the online program and Dana Reinecke, professor at Sage College, created the curriculum, Scrimshaw says. Reinecke says the degree emphasizes critical thinking, analysis, writing and reading. The program is expected to attract students from all over the world who may not be able to thrive in a traditional college classroom.Coursework will be available by video, audio and text, and students will continue their courses throughout the summer months. Tuition for the first two years is about $27,000, but when the course load doubles in the third and fourth year, it is scheduled to increase to $43,000, the Times-Union says.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 18 (UPI) -- A California scientist who has been working to debunk Dec. 21 apocalypse theories on his website is appearing in NASA videos on the same subject.David Morrison, 72, of Mountain View, senior scientist at the Astrobiology Institute at NASA Ames Research Center and a former student of famed scientist Carl Sagan, said he has been debunking theories about the apocalypse for about four years on his website, "Ask an Astrobiologist," the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News reported Tuesday."I got my first doomsday question four years ago and wondered what the heck it was," he said. "Perhaps I made the mistake of answering them, but since then I've gotten a little over 2,000 emails. I got 200 last weekend."Morrison has also been appearing in NASA-produced videos on scientific subjects, and he said the doomsday-related videos have been getting more hits than any subject other than the Mars rover.Morrison said the theories, which include a giant planet being bound to collide with Earth and solar flares destroying life on the planet, can be damaging to those who fear them to be true."I get questions from people saying, 'I'm 11 years old, and I can't sleep, I can't eat.' I have had kids saying they are considering suicide, mothers emailing me saying they are considering killing their children before the end of times," he said.Rosemary Joyce, a professor of anthropology at the University of California-Berkeley, said the Dec. 21 hysteria stems from a misunderstanding of the ancient Mayan calendar. She said the date marks the end of the 13th 394-year cycle in the calendar."It's not the end of the calendar," Joyce said. "It's the end of a cycle. It rolls over, like an odometer."

BANGKOK, June 27 (UPI) -- Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his seven ministers easily won a confidence vote Friday despite opposition charges of mismanagement and inefficiency.The six-party coalition led by Samak's People's Power Party, which has been in power for only four months, defeated the no-confidence motion in a 280-162 vote, Thai News Agency reported. The coalition enjoys a big majority in the 480-member lower house.Samak's Cabinet had come under strong attack for three days from the sole opposition Democrat Party, which has 164 seats.The ministers surviving the non-confidence vote include Deputy Prime Minister-Finance Minister Surapong Suebwonglee, Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama and Interior Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, the report said.Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva was quoted as saying his party didn't expect to topple the government but wanted to shed focus on what he claimed is the government's mismanagement and inefficiency.Among the issues was the opposition charge of government's failure to resolve Thailand's rice output and inflation problems.

BOSTON, Oct. 9 (UPI) -- A body bound to a concrete block with chains pulled from the Charles River in Boston Tuesday was confirmed by prosecutors as that of a missing graduate student.The office of District Attorney Daniel Conley issued a statement saying the death of Jonathan Dailey, whose body was found near the Boston University Bridge, was being investigated by state police detectives. The 23-year-old North Carolina native's identity was confirmed by dental records. His cause of death had not been determined."We rule out no possibility and we promise Mr. Dailey's family a thorough, comprehensive search for the truth as we investigate his death," the statement said.The Boston Globe reported a source it described as a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said Dailey's body was bound with chains and weighted down by a cinder block. The official said investigators were trying to determine whether Dailey was a victim of foul play or whether his death was due to other circumstances, including suicide.The statement from the district attorney's office said prosecutors would not discuss any evidence that had been recovered, the newspaper said.Dailey, who had been missing since Oct. 2, was taking a semester off from coursework at Boston Architectural College, the Globe said.His body was spotted by a Boston University rowing coach.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand, Sept. 16 (UPI) -- The Roman Catholic Church has accepted as valid five new complaints of child abuse by priests and other officials in New Zealand, officials said.The most recent allegations were made beginning in June. In four instances, victims reported having been sexually abused by priests, one of whom has already been convicted of child molestation in a separate case, The Dominion Post said Tuesday. The fifth allegation is over neglect by nuns at a boarding school.Bill Kilgallon, head of the church's national office handling abuse allegations in the country, said the five complaints had been investigated and accepted as valid. The incidents took place from the 1960s to the 1980s. All the alleged perpetrators except the one who was previously convicted are dead, the Post said.Kilgallon said there will almost certainly be more allegations in the coming months. Neighboring Australia has established a national commission on institutional child sex abuse in the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts, the Salvation Army and the Anglican Church. Testimony there will almost certainly deal with groups that operated in both countries.Commission hearings began Monday though the portion dealing with the Catholic Church isn't scheduled until December.

Adam Parrish Wainwright (born August 30, 1981) is a right-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals. He was drafted 29th overall by the Atlanta Braves in the 2000 amateur draft. He made his major league debut for the St. Louis Cardinals on September 11, 2005 against the New York Mets.
A highly valued prospect coming out of Glynn Academy, Wainwright planned to play college baseball for Georgia Tech, signing a letter of intent with the Yellow Jackets. But, when he was selected 29th overall in the first round of the 2000 amateur draft by his favorite team, the Atlanta Braves, Wainwright chose to forgo college and go straight to the pros, signing a contract with the Braves that included a $1.25 million bonus.
In December 2003, Wainwright was sent to the Cardinals along with pitchers Jason Marquis and Ray King in a trade that sent outfielder J. D. Drew and utility man Eli Marrero to the Atlanta Braves. After two somewhat uneven seasons in the Cardinals' minor-league system, Wainwright made his MLB debut for St. Louis on September 11, 2005.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
