SITGES, Spain, June 2 (UPI) -- Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for a central European authority over individual government finances."The European Union needs to reinforce its architecture. This entails moving towards more integration, transferring more sovereignty, especially in the fiscal field," he said at a speaking engagement in Catalonia, The Daily Telegraph reported Saturday.He called for "centralized control" over government finances."And this means a compromise to create a new European fiscal authority which would guide the fiscal policy in the eurozone, harmonize the fiscal policy of member states and enable a centralized control of [public] finances," he said.Given the precarious position of Spain's banks, which are said to require billions of fresh dollars to remain in business, and the size of the Spanish economy -- fourth largest in Europe -- Rajoy's pronouncement could have a catalytic effect on the argument that a central authority would give eurozone countries more collective clout in their effort to save the euro.Further integration of either the 17-member eurozone or the 27-member European Union would send investors the signal that the euro is here to stay, the Telegraph said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already said further discussions over a more centralized authority over government finances would be worthwhile.Rajoy has said he would support an region-wide banking union. Plans for recapitalization of Spain's struggling banks are expected by the end of June, he said.

MONROVIA, Calif., April 19 (UPI) -- The U.S. Air Force has ordered an undisclosed number of Puma small unmanned aerial systems from AeroVironment of California.The order for the Pumas -- the first Air Force order for the aircraft -- comes through an existing U.S. Army contract. It is a firm fixed-price order and worth $2.4 million, the company said.The order was received this month and the aircraft will be delivered before the month is over.The Puma, which is battery-powered, weighs 13 pounds, has a flight endurance of 2 hours and carries an integrated electro-optical and infrared gimbaled video camera. Each Puma system consists of three air vehicles and two ground control systems."More military services are choosing the Puma system because its longer duration and more precise imagery deliver enhanced organic reconnaissance," said Tom Herring, AeroVironment senior vice president and general manager of Unmanned Aircraft Systems."The Air Force already employs our RQ-11B Raven and Wasp small unmanned aircraft systems. With the Puma small UAS they will have a more comprehensive set of capabilities for force protection and force multiplication, anywhere and at any time."

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, April 2 (UPI) -- John Mayer confirmed on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" his breakup with fellow U.S. recording star Katy Perry but he declined to offer details about the split."It was a very private relationship going in," he told DeGeneres on Tuesday's edition of her show. "It was a private relationship during and it's a private relationship still."DeGeneres said she is a friend of Perry's and knows she and Mayer broke up some time after the Grammy Awards ceremony in February."I just want to say, I love you and my thoughts are with you," DeGeneres told Mayer, who thanked her for her support."I can understand asking the question based on some previous answers I have given but I have finally learned how to put the wall between one thing and the other," he said, referring to how he was criticized for talking about his past courtships with Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson."I've been much happier since then," Mayer said. "I'm on the same journey as everyone else. Coupling is a tricky thing."

VICTORIA, British Columbia, Oct. 1 (UPI) -- Climate change and its effect on water temperatures and oxygen content could cause fish species to shrink in size by 24 percent, Canadian researchers say.Scientists at the University of British Columbia have modeled the impact rising temperatures could have on more than 600 species by 2050.Decreasing oxygen levels caused by warmer waters could reduce fish body weight as well as have an effect on the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species, the researchers said.Relatively small changes in temperatures could have "unexpectedly large" impacts on fish body size, they said, because the level of oxygen in the water is affected."Rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function," study lead author William Cheung told BBC News."This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size."Fish body size could shrink between 14 percent and 24 percent, the researchers said, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30 (UPI) -- The Los Angeles Lakers scored 41 points in the fourth quarter Tuesday and outlasted the Los Angeles Clippers 116-103 Tuesday.Xavier Henry led the Lakers with 22 points and Jordan Farmar scored 16 in an attack that featured five reserve players in double figures. Pao Gasol added 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Lakers in their season opener and first meeting with a Clippers squad that many pre-season analysts predicted would have a better year than the rebuilding Lakers.The Lakers did not have Kobe Bryant in the lineup. Bryant continues to rehabilitate the Achilles tendon he injured last season.The Lakers led 75-79 at the end of the third quarter and outscored their in-city rivals 41-27 in the final period. The Clippers scored two points in the final 1:19.Blake Griffin led the Clippers with 19 points. DeAndre Jordan added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Chris Paul added 15 points and 11 assists.The Clippers bench was also productive Tuesday with J.J. Reddick scoring 13 points, but it was not enough to save Doc Rivers from a loss in his debut as the Clippers head coach.

KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- A probe into the alleged mishandling of the Koran at a military base in Afghanistan has been launched by international authorities, a U.N .official said.Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Kabul to protest the burning of the Koran. At least five people were killed in demonstrations Wednesday, CNN reports.The U.S. Embassy in Kabul was on lockdown after Afghans shouted anti-American slogans during the protests.Jan Kubis, the U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, expressed regret for the "improper handling" of the Koran. A readout from the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan stated the incident was a "sad mistake" that in no way reflects the United Nations' respect for the Islamic faith.Kubis added that authorities with the U.N.-backed International Security Assistance Force launch an investigation into the incident. UNAMA said troops "inadvertently" disposed of Islamic materials at Bagram, including copies of the Koran.White House spokesman Jay Carney described the incident as "deeply unfortunate."The alleged desecration comes as the possibility of peace talks between Afghan government officials and members of the Taliban moves forward. Western officials had said they welcomed the initiative so long as the Taliban denounced violence, though the conservative Islamist group said it wouldn't talk while foreign forces were on the ground in Afghanistan.

KAILUA, Hawaii, Jan. 6 (UPI) -- The first family was back in Washington Sunday after bidding aloha to Hawaii where President Obama's vacation was interrupted by the fiscal cliff negotiations.Obama and his family wrapped up their winter getaway Saturday night by dining with unidentified family friends at the local steakhouse Buzz's near Kailua Beach Park. They left about 8:30 p.m. local time and headed to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for the flight home aboard Air Force One.The Obama daughters boarded the plane while their parents worked the crowd on hand before walking across the tarmac hand-in-hand to join them. The president put his arm around the first lady's waist as they walked up the stairs, then turned to wave goodbye.Malia, carrying a bright green backpack, and Sasha were the first ones off the plane when it touched down on the mainland. The president was sporting a white shirt, blue blazer and black pants when he disembarked.The first family then jumped on Marine One for the helicopter ride to the White House, arriving at 11:30 a.m. EST.Obama placed his arm around his smiling older daughter as they headed toward the residence. Michelle Obama had her arm around Sasha as they followed.The president and first lady waved to the pool reporter but he didn't respond when asked "How was the trip?"Obama had no public events on his daily planner Sunday but he did sign into law a bill that temporarily increases the Federal Emergency Management Agency's borrowing authority for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program.On Monday, it's back to his usual routine, with a closed briefing in the Oval Office in the morning.The press wasn't made privy to what the president and his family did the rest of his final day in Hawaii, but a small group of demonstrators showed up in the neighborhood holding up signs. One implored "No Drone Warfare," while another asked "Is it really OK if Obama does it?"The tone wasn't as supportive as the well-wishers who cheered Obama and first lady Michelle Obama when they left Nobu, a popular Waikiki restaurant where they dined with friends, about 12:09 a.m. Saturday.

| License Photo	VATICAN CITY, July 12 (UPI) -- The detention of Pope Benedict XVI's butler, suspected of leaking documents to the news media, has been extended, Vatican officials said Thursday. Paolo Gabriele has now been held for 50 days. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said he will remain behind bars at least "for another few days," the Italian news agency ANSA reported. About 30 people have been questioned so far, Lombardi said. "Formal interrogation of Gabriele" can begin once investigators have finished with other interviews, he added. The Vatican has a small jail but anyone who receives a substantial sentence is transferred to an Italian prison and housed there at the Catholic church's expense. Gabriele is suspected of leaking documents, including letters from Carlo Maria Vigano, formerly Vatican City's deputy governor and now its ambassador to the United States, to the pope and Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone.

| License Photo	Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Obamacare death panels have nothing on this guy.The Japanese deputy prime minister Taro Aso kicked up a storm of controversy Monday with his comments on the financial burden the elderly place on society.The 72-year old finance minister said elderly should be allowed to "hurry up and die" at a meeting of the National Council on Social Security reforms, hoping to ease the financial strain caused by an aging population where fertility rates are low and the economy is struggling.Heaven forbid if you are forced to live on when you want to die," Aso said. "You cannot sleep well when you think it's all being paid for by the government.""This won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die."According to ABC News, Aso said later he intended the comments to refer to his own wishes, not the way he hoped all Japanese elderly will be treated."Even if (doctors) said they could keep me alive, it would be unbearable," he said. "I would feel guilty, knowing that (treatment) was being paid for by the government."Nearly a quarter of the Japanese population are seniors, and in the next 50 year, more than 40 percent of the population is expected to be over the age of 65.Aso is no stranger to controversy: the former prime minister once said he wanted to make Japan the kind of country where "the richest Jews would want to live," and compared the opposition to the Nazis.
