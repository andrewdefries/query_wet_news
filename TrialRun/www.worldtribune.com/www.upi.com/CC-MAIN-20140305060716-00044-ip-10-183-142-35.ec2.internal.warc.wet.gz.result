The European recession is deeper and more entrenched than many believed, the continent's primary data agency said Thursday.The European Union's data office Eurostat said the eurozone's economy in the fourth quarter dropped 0.6 percent compared to the third, a deeper contraction than expected. The larger European Union's gross domestic product dropped 0.5 percent quarter to quarter.It is a report where positive numbers are hard to find, primarily because the duration of the recession in Europe has pushed positive figures off the standard charts Eurostat provides.The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is in its fourth year. On the charts, the GDP in the eurozone has been negative for three consecutive quarters and it was unchanged for the two quarters preceding that. For the third quarter of 2012, the GDP for the European Union as a whole actually rose over the second quarter at a marginal 0.1 percent. In Germany, Europe's largest economy, the economy contracted 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, dragging the country's annual growth down to 0.4 percent. France, with the second largest economy in the EU, experienced a decline of 0.3 percent, falling for the third quarter out of the past four. In Spain, the economy shrank 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter and 1.8 percent compared to the same quarter of 2011. Italy's numbers are even worse, down 0.9 percent quarter-to-quarter and down 2.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.The most pronounced drops are in Greece and Portugal. The economy in Greece, where positive numbers have been a no-show for years, is off 6 percent from the same three months of 2011. In Portugal, the economy shrank 1.8 percent quarter to quarter and 3.8 percent from the fourth quarter of the previous year.Stock markets took the news hard. In midday trading in Europe, the FTSE 100 index in Britain dropped 0.74 percent while the DAX 30 in Germany dropped 1.14 percent. The CAC 40 in France fell 0.87 percent while the Stoxx Europe 600 index lost 0.46 percent.The prospects also look dim. Like the United States, the economies of Europe are attempting a recovery without spending a dime to pull it off. After a brief experiment with stimulus programs that were too thin and too short lived, European leaders, alarmed by sovereign debt crisis in Greece, pulled back, choosing austerity over stimulation. By all rights, investor confidence should be higher but investors gravitate toward profits as much as they do sound footing. A show of hands: How many would invest in a sure-fire, short-lived meteoric scheme versus a sound investment? Yes, Warren Buffett, your answer was clear before the question was asked, but how about everybody else? The White House and the European Commission announced Wednesday trade talks would begin with broad agenda including matching regulations on either side of the Atlantic Ocean to spur the largest trading relationship in the world to even greater heights.This is precisely the strategy Europe and the United States can afford right now: stimulus provided by rule changes rather than by tossing money into job-creating initiatives.It's the type of program that comes around when you look at your checkbook and realize you can't afford anything else. But it's a start, even if the United States runs a trade deficit with Europe every month.In other markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan rose 0.5 percent while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong added 0.85 percent. The Sensex in India dropped 0.57 percent while the S&P/ASX index in Australia rose 0.66 percent.

ATLANTA, June 21 (UPI) -- Heat-related deaths are on the rise; in a two-week period in 2012, excessive heat exposure resulted in 32 deaths in four states, federal health officials say. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said the study found the heat-related deaths in 2012 were four times the typical average for those states -- Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia -- for the same two-week period from 1999-09."No one should die from a heat wave, but extreme heat causes more deaths than any other weather event," a statement by the CDC said. "Extreme heat can lead to very high body temperatures, brain and organ damage, and even death. People suffer heat-related illness when their bodies are unable to properly compensate and cool themselves."During high temperatures and high humidity people should: -- Going to an air-conditioned place and wearing light, loose clothing. -- Staying hydrated by drinking more water than usual and avoiding drinks with alcohol, caffeine, or carbonation.-- Staying informed by tuning in to heat-related alerts in your area.-- Watch for symptoms such as muscle cramping, heavy sweating, rapid heartbeat, nausea, or fainting.

BASRA, Iraq, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Remaining British troops in Iraq's Basra province were called on by Iraqi forces to support a raid on a major smuggling operation on the Shatt al Arab Waterway.Iraqi and British forces have been targeting what officials call gangs smuggling arms and other assets to militants in the region. A recent operation led by soldiers from the 14th Iraqi Army Division and supported by troops from the British Spearhead Platoon 1st Duke of Lancaster's Battle Group on the Shatt al Arab Waterway intercepted the criminal gangs attempting to transport arms and munitions, the British Ministry of Defense reported. Officials say the four barges were equipped with heavy machine guns and armed militants. When the suspected criminal smuggling operation entered Iraqi waters, a firefight ensued. "They were engaging us with accurate heavy machine gun fire and we needed to sort it before we started to take casualties," British Cpl. John Thompson said in a statement.British officials credit the Iraqi units for the eventual success during the smuggling bust and say the Iraqi forces only called the British in for extra help."The operation was about supporting the Iraqi Security Forces; it is their success, not ours," said Lt. Col. Gary Deakin, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster. "They fought a tough fight and just needed a little extra support, both moral and physical to finish the job. They are a very capable lot. That is our job now and we are glad to be there to help."

| License Photo	FORT HOOD, Texas, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- The military judge hearing the case of the U.S. Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 has been removed, officials said.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces Monday removed Col. Gregory Gross, saying he showed an "appearance of bias" in the case against Maj. Nidal Hasan, the San Antonio Express-News reported Tuesday.The court issued its ruling on a disputed order requiring Hasan to shave his beard, which he grew in violation of Army grooming standards."I'm kind of at a loss for words," Jeffrey Addicott, head of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, told the Express-News. "I think that's one thing nobody would have anticipated, that the [court] would have taken such an extreme measure given the fact that the judge was only attempting to comply with military regulations regarding grooming standards."Hasan is charged in the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting spree in which 13 people died and 32 were wounded. He began growing the beard during the summer, leading to Gross fining him $1,000 on six occasions.Hasan, paralyzed from the chest down after being shot by post police, said he grew the beard because of his Muslim faith, arguing that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allowed him to have it. Army regulations permit sideburns and mustaches.Among other things, prosecutors argued Gross had a right to maintain the courtroom decorum and if Hasan had a beard at trial, it would have offended soldiers and undermined morale, the Express-News said.In its ruling, the appeals court said Hasan's command was responsible for enforcing grooming standards, not the judge. While Gross could control his courtroom, the evidence wasn't strong enough Hasan's beard "materially interfered with the proceedings."Gross' order "to remove [Hasan] from the courtroom, the contempt citation and the decision to order [Hasan's] forcible shaving in the absence of any command action to do the same could lead an objective observer to conclude that the military judge was not impartial towards appellant," the ruling said, noting Gross and relatives were at Fort Hood on the day of the shooting.A Fort Hood spokesman said the court's opinion was being reviewed.

Many bringing citizens back from Egypt
CAIRO, Jan. 31 (UPI) -- The first wave of foreigners left Egypt Monday amid growing fears for public safety, the U.S. State Department said.The voluntary evacuations to Athens, Greece; Istanbul, Turkey; Nicosia, Cyprus, and other nearby "safe-haven" European locations will continue until all Americans wanting to leave but unable to get commercial flights are airlifted to safety, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs said.The State Department tweeted Monday morning 220 Americans had been evacuated. State was hoping to get 900 out by the end of the day.An estimated 90,000 Americans live and work in Egypt, most in cities now roiled by anti-government protests, looting and a military presence.U.S. citizens taking the charter flights will be required to reimburse Washington for the airfare at commercial-flight rates, Jacobs said.The State Department set up an evacuation hot line at 1-202-501-4444, or 1-888-407-4747 in the United States, and a special e-mail address, egyptemergencyusc@state.gov. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is closed indefinitely.Jacobs said Washington was largely relying on friends and families in the United States to relay evacuation information to stranded Americans.Other countries evacuating citizens Monday included Azerbaijan, Belgium, Canada, China, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan and Turkey, the governments said.Britain, France, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand were among the countries poised to evacuate but waiting. They urged their nationals to avoid "non-essential" travel and encouraged those wishing to leave to take commercial flights.More than 100 protesters were reported killed since demonstrations began Tuesday. About 750 police officers and 1,500 protesters were injured.Cairo International Airport, Egypt's busiest, was packed with thousands of nervous and frustrated travelers anxious to flee, including Egyptians hoping to escape the turmoil, The New York Times reported Monday.More than 1,000 people unable to get inside Terminal 1, used by foreign carriers including Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, sat outside on sidewalks and in the parking lot surrounded by luggage, the Times said.

VOLGOGRAD, Russia, Dec. 30 (UPI) -- Two deadly bombings in less than 24 hours in Volgograd, Russia, put Russian security leaders on high alert, a deputy minister said.Russian Deputy Emergency Minister Vladimir Stepanov said officials are on high alert and prepared for another attack, given the Russian New Year is only a few days away and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi kick off Feb. 7, Euronews.com reported."A state of emergency was introduced in Volgograd yesterday [Sunday], so all the organizations and services are working on this," Stepanov said. "But, as I have already said, to ensure security during the holiday period, the entire emergencies ministry has been put on high alert."At least 14 people were killed in the trolleybus bomb blast Monday. The day before, 17 people were killed in another bomb explosion at a railway station. Russian investigation officials said suicide bombers likely were behind the two incidents and were testing the DNA from the suspected bombers' remains collected at both scenes.Terrorist incidents have been persistent in southern Russia despite efforts to step up security ahead of the Olympic Games in Sochi, about 430 miles from Volgograd, RIA Novosti said.International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach issued a statement "utterly condemning" the "despicable attack on innocent people.""Sadly, terrorism is a global disease but it must never be allowed to triumph," he said."The Olympic Games are about bringing people from all backgrounds and beliefs together to overcome our differences in a peaceful way. The many declarations of support and solidarity from the international community make me confident that this message of tolerance will also be delivered by the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi."In Washington, a statement issued by National Security Council representative Caitlin Hayden condemned the attacks and offered security assistance for the Winter Games."The United States stands in solidarity with the Russian people against terrorism," the statement said. "The U.S. government has offered our full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games, and we would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants."The U.N. Security Council expressed outraged over the trolleybus and railway station attacks."These abhorrent and abominable attacks deliberately targeted places of mass gathering, in particular public transportation," the Security Council said in a statement, noting the need to bring those responsible for Monday's "reprehensible act of terrorism to justice." A blanket protected an 8-month-old baby from life-threatening burns in the trolleybus explosion even though the attack killed the child's mother and grandmother, RT reported. The infant, in a coma, was listed in critical condition at a nearby hospital.Students from Volgograd's universities volunteered to assist those injured in the trolleybus blast, helping nurses and medics at the hospital, RT reported. Also, several businesses in the city once known as Stalingrad provided commuters with transportation to work. Meanwhile, a charity campaign has been started by the Volgograd Charity Foundation has started a charity campaign and the Spiritual Administration of Muslims in Moscow launched a fundraising effort for the families of the bombing victims, RT reported.Russian authorities said 1 million rubles (about $30,400) will be given to the families of those who were killed in the trolleybus explosion. Relatives of those injured will receive between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($6,000-$12,000), depending on the injuries. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered security tightened in Volgograd, Moscow and elsewhere, and met with leaders of the Federal Security Service and Interior Ministry Monday.RIA Novosti said video footage broadcast by TV station Rossiya-24 showed the blackened shell of the vehicle with its roof blown outward by the explosion and debris scattered across the street.Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said it appeared the explosive device was placed in the vehicle's passenger cabin.In October, six people were killed and 37 injured in a terrorist attack in Volgograd when a bomb carried by a woman from Dagestan exploded as she traveled on a commuter bus.

Alexander Douglas Smith (born May 7, 1984) is a professional American football quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League. Smith was drafted with the 1st-overall pick in the 1st round of the 2005 NFL Draft by San Francisco from the University of Utah.
His father, Douglas D. Smith, was the Executive Director at the high school Alex attended, Helix High School, until June 30, 2010. His uncle is John L. Smith, former head coach for the Michigan State University Spartans’ football team. His second cousin is New York Mets first baseman Chris Shelton.
Born in Seattle, Smith grew up in La Mesa, California. As a starter at Helix during his junior and senior years Smith led his team to a record of 25-1, including two San Diego CIF section championships. He was named to the first-team all-conference and all-county squads in the San Diego CIF system. Smith also earned the conference offensive player of the year twice, and twice won the team MVP for Helix. During his time at Helix, Smith set a school record by throwing for six touchdowns in one game, and recorded the second-highest completion percentage in San Diego CIF history. While at Helix, he played with 2005 Heisman Trophy winner (since vacated) Reggie Bush. Smith and Bush were later finalists for the 2004 Heisman, making it the first time a high school had two finalists at the same ceremony.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
