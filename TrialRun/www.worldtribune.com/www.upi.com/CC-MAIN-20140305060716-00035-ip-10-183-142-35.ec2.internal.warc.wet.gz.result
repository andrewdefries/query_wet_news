WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UPI) -- The U.S. Treasury is preparing to order bailed out companies to cut their top executive salaries about 90 percent, a source close to the discussions said.The New York Times reported that a government official said the Treasury's pay czar Kenneth Feinberg had set schedules on compensation for executives under his jurisdiction with drastic cuts. The pay schedule would drop total compensation for the top 25 executives at seven firms by an average of 50 percent, the Times reported.Feinberg has jurisdiction over the highest paid executives at Citigroup, Bank of America, American International Group, General Motors, Chrysler, GMAC and Chrysler Financial.Although more than 650 firms received Treasury funds in the past year, the Troubled Asset Relief program allows for the government to set salaries at companies that received extraordinary assistance.Huge salaries at bailed out companies have been met with political uproar in the United States and Europe. Recently, White House officials have turned up the rhetorical heat. White House adviser David Axelrod called the huge bonus checks "offensive."

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, June 21 (UPI) -- Russian energy company Gazprom said it was interested in working further in the oil and natural gas sector in the Kurdish north of Iraq.Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller met in St. Petersburg with Massoud Barzani, president of the semiautonomous Kurdistan Regional Government.Gazprom in a statement said both sides discussed the possibility of closer cooperation in the oil and natural gas sector."In particular, the parties discussed the progress with interaction in oil and gas field exploration, development and operation," the company said Thursday.Gazprom Neft, the oil subsidiary of Gazprom, is in the process of exploration activity in the Garmian and Shakal blocks in the southern regions of the Kurdish territories. Iraq has the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. A 2012 assessment from the International Energy Agency said Iraqi oil production could expand exponentially over the coming years. The IEA said Iraq could eventually pass Russia as a major oil exporter.Disputes over national oil laws, however, have cast a shadow over the Iraqi energy sector. The central government in Baghdad says it may be illegal for the Kurdish government to make its own deals, bypassing Baghdad.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UPI) -- Semiconductors may be the best way for China to move beyond simply being regarded the factory to the world, albeit a huge one at that.Given that chips are found in all technology-driven products from computers to consumer goods, becoming a world leader in producing them will lead to greater power for the country, according to William Archey, chief executive of the American Electronics Association and former U.S. Department of Commerce official. "Semiconductors determine so many things ... so China must become a leader in chips" if it is to remain a formidable economic force, Archey said at a briefing on high technology in China hosted by the Council on Foreign Affairs Wednesday. Certainly, the Chinese authorities appear to agree with that assessment as lawmakers make clear that investing in the technology sector is key for the country's growth, a fact noted by Adam Segal, senior fellow of China studies at the council. "Information technology, the environment, aerospace, energy, and biotech are where the (government) money is focused on," Segal said, adding that U.S. policymakers too could learn from the priorities outlined by their Chinese counterparts as many still appear oblivious to the fact that the United States might be losing ground when it comes to training technology specialists.As a result, it would be good for lawmakers and the general public alike to be wary of the so-called China threat, given that it may well be a reality, Archey said. Still, there are perhaps more opportunities to be had as China becomes more of an equal to the United States when it comes to raking in profits. For instance, both Archey and Segal pointed out that the Chinese government was far more open than the Japanese, especially as the Japanese fought hard to protect their domestic companies by keeping foreign competition at bay. "In Japan, it was always a question of market access" when it came to negotiating with the Chinese authorities, Segal said. He pointed out that in the case of China as well as India, it has been clear that the governments wanted to emulate the U.S. business model, which has not been the case in Japan.Of course, one of the issues for technology companies doing business in China has been the protection of intellectual property, or lack thereof, which has not been the case when operating in Japan. But analysts have broadly agreed that once the Chinese start producing goods that require patent protection, it will quickly be in the government's interest to start imposing the laws to assure Chinese corporate profits.Meanwhile, there is likely to be a shift within China on how business is conducted in coming years. Many of those who are currently driving business in China "are scientists, who aren't necessarily the best managers," Archey said, adding that a large number of those want to be their own boss, resulting in the establishment of numerous smaller enterprises rather than a handful of powerful industrial groups.

TEHRAN, Nov. 19 (UPI) -- How well nuclear negotiations go with the International Atomic Energy Agency depends in the nature of the talks, an Iranian envoy said.Tehran is to sit down with delegates from the IAEA next month to discuss Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Iranian government is accused of pursuing the technology needed to produce a nuclear weapon, an allegation Tehran denies.Ali Asghar Soltanieh, the Iranian envoy to the IAEA, called for a pragmatic discourse during the December talks."The success of talks in Tehran in removing the ambiguities (about Iran nuclear program) would depend on a calm atmosphere free from political hues and cries," he told the semiofficial Fars News Agency.A report last week in The New York Times stated that recent assessments from the IAEA suggested Iran had finished installing equipment at its underground Fordo nuclear facility. The Times report stated that while nuclear fuel production hadn't escalated at the site, some of the fuel produced there could be diverted for use in a weapon.An early November report from the IAEA stated that nuclear inspectors were unable to "conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities."

JERUSALEM, Sept. 4 (UPI) -- Israel's top court Tuesday ordered the attorney general to explain why two prominent leaders were not tried for participating in the May 2010 flotilla.The High Court of Justice said Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein must provide a more detailed reason why he chose not to prosecute Haneen Zoabi, a member of the Israeli parliament or Knesset, and Sheikh Raed Salah, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, The Jerusalem Post reported.Zoabi, an Arab member of the Knesset, and Salah were both aboard the Mari Marmara, which was part of a flotilla carrying 10,000 tons of aid to the Gaza Strip. The ship was boarded by Israeli naval commandos after the ship refused to divert to the Israeli port city of Ashdod. In the subsequent clash, nine activists were killed and seven commandos were injured.A petition requesting the decision was filled with the court Monday by Knesset member Michael Ben-Ari, activist Itamar Ben-Givir and the Movement for Our Land of Israel.The three filed the petition as part of an attempt to force the state to file the case. They hope a fuller explanation of the state's decision will allow them to point out errors in its reasoning.Previously, the attorney general's office had released a short statement regarding the decision without offering an explanation, the office's standard practice.In a short two-page ruling, the court gave general guidelines on what had to be revealed, but gave the state the discretion not to reveal classified information. The court cited no legal precedents in its decision.The state has 30 days to produce a more detailed explanation.

March. 19 (UPI) -- Christopher Robinson, 23, skipped out on child support for his 2-year-old, never making a single payment.The court ordered Facebook to allow the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office full access to Robinson's account. Facebook can help police build child support cases with evidence of a lifestyle out of line with payment.Investigators found that Robinson had posed for photos holding liquor and wads of cash.Milwaukee County Chief Deputy District Attorney Kent Lovern told CBS 58 that photos may be enough to lead to an arrest or at least effective in strengthening a case. "What a photograph enables us to do, is if somebody has more money than maybe they are indicating they do, that allows us to apply to the court for a search warrant."Robinson now faces felony charges for failure to pay child support.

By the mid 1980s the Wall Street Journal reported he was "perhaps the most powerful journalist in America," in a league with Walter Lippmann (1899–1975).
Will was born in Champaign, Illinois, the son of Frederick L. Will and Louise Hendrickson Will. His father was a respected professor of philosophy, specializing in epistemology, at the University of Illinois.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
