NEW YORK, Aug. 3 (UPI) -- Mostly overlooked in the debate about allowing more oil drilling in the United States is that the vast majority of new wells are for natural gas, analysts say.Onshore energy leases in the western United States during the Bush administration have mostly gone to natural gas exploration. The average annual production of natural gas was 2.4 billion cubic feet from 2001 to 2007, up from an average of 1.8 billion cubic feet annually during the Clinton administration, The New York Times reported Sunday.Oil produced from domestic onshore sources, meanwhile, declined. In the first six years of the Bush administration, average yearly domestic oil production was 97.9 million barrels annually, compared to 111.5 million barrels in the Clinton years. The wellhead price of natural gas is about five times higher than it was in the 1990s, environmentalists say, providing evidence that more domestic production of oil and gas won't affect its price. "We've turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is $4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof," Dusty Horwitt, a senior analyst for public lands at the Environmental Working Group, told the newspaper.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 24 (UPI) -- The Canadian government said it was interested in establishing a better trade relationship with South Korea, one of the world's largest LNG consumers.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has courted Asian economies to diversify an energy sector dependent on U.S. markets. Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver met with South Korean business representatives on a west coast tour this week. Oliver said the government viewed trade with South Korea as a top priority. South Korea is the second largest importer of liquefied natural gas in the world."Our government recognizes that exports to South Korea are an important contributor to Canada's prosperity," he said Tuesday.The Canadian National Energy Board said this week it was reviewing LNG applications. Imperial Oil Resources Ltd. and Exxon Mobil Canada Ltd. filed an application Wednesday with the NEB for the approval of an LNG terminal on the west coast of British Columbia. "The request to the NEB is for authorization to export up to 30 million tons of LNG per year for 25 years," the companies said.BG Group filed a separate application to export 14 million tons of LNG per year from a proposed facility on Ridley Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.

| License Photo	HONG KONG, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- Michael Bay was threatened by an intoxicated, air conditioner-wielding man on the Hong Kong set of "Transformers: Age of Extinction," Paramount Pictures said."Contrary to several erroneous news reports made today, Bay did not get hurt in a fight on set," the studio said in a statement about the director-producer to EW.com Thursday. "The production company did have a bizarre encounter with a man (allegedly under the influence of a narcotic substance) who was wielding an air conditioning unit as a weapon," the statement said. "The man, who had earlier accosted several other crew members, rushed onto the set in Quarry Bay and swung the air conditioning unit directly at Bay's head. The director ducked and wrested the air conditioner from his attacker, preventing what could have been a serious accident. The company's security team quickly stepped in and subdued the assault. The police, who also scuffled with the assailant and two of his companions, ultimately arrested the three men. No one on the cast or crew was injured and the production immediately resumed filming without further incident."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- The European Union and the United States this week urged Ukraine to enhance energy security by implementing the privatization of its state-owned natural gas monopoly.EU leaders and their U.S. counterparts made the call Monday as part of an EU-U.S. meeting in Washington during which a wide range of energy issues were discussed.One of the topics was Ukraine's cash-strapped state oil and gas company Naftogaz, whose privatization and breakup into separate transmission and production, transportation and sales components will be accomplished by the end of the year, Kiev has said.Members of the U.S.-EU Energy Council, led by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, issued a statement Monday saying the reform of Naftogaz is an "urgent" matter that needs to be accomplished to secure Europe's energy security.After praising Ukraine's February accession to the EU's Energy Community, which they called an important step toward increasing its trade and economic ties with Europe, council members said they felt the "urgency of Ukraine implementing the reforms in its gas sector."The restructuring would, they said, "permit the international financial institutions and the private sector to invest in the modernization of the gas transit system," on which Western Europe depends for a large portion of its natural gas supplies.Ukraine Minister of Energy and Coal Industry Yuriy Boyko said in September the restructuring of Naftogaz would be accomplished before the end of the year, with at least four new companies created and privatized.The moves, he said, would raise $12 billion from foreign investors. One of them could be the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom, which is reportedly considering a partnership with the EU and Naftogaz to buy and upgrade Ukraine's vital gas transmission system, through which Russian gas transits to European customers.The U.S.-EU Energy Council, which includes U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu and EU Commissioner for Energy Gunther Oettinger, urged Ukraine to move ahead with plans to accept partners for its gas production operations as well.This, they said, is necessary to "attract international investment in the development of Ukraine's conventional and unconventional energy resources in a responsible and efficient manner, as well as promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy resources."Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov has said the reforms are awaiting the finalization of a renegotiated 10-year gas price agreement with Moscow, which multiple reports have indicated would include a slashing of gas prices charged to Ukraine in exchange for a stake in a privatized Naftogaz.The Kremlin said in mid-November no deal had been reached.Azarov has also indicated a $15 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund, on hold due to Kiev's reluctance to raise prices charged to consumers, would be back on track after an agreement with Gazprom is reached, The Wall Street Journal reported.Disagreements between Ukraine and Gazprom over prices the utility charges have long contributed to tensions between the countries.Gazprom's move to shut off gas supplies to Ukraine in a 2009 price dispute left European customers without gas for heat.Ukraine is seeking a significant discount in the price it is paying for Russian natural gas, hoping to reduce costs from $355 per 1,000 cubic meters, which it says is the highest in Europe, to $230.

| License Photo	REDFORD, Mich., Dec. 10 (UPI) -- President Obama took his plan to avert the fiscal cliff of higher taxes and spending cuts to Michigan Monday, arguing his plan would be fair and responsible.Obama visited the Daimler Detroit Diesel plant in Redford where he praised the crowd of current employees and previous generations of workers who, for more than 70 years, "have done your part to build up America's manufacturing strength."Companies such as Daimler, based in Germany, know that investing in America's workers is a "smart bet," Obama said. "The competitive balance is tipping a little bit" in America's favor and companies are seeing "it makes sense to invest here in America."The economy is growing again, business has created more than 5.5 million new jobs during the last 33 months and the country is "making progress ... moving in [the] right direction ... going forward."If nothing is done, Obama said, taxes for a typical middle-class taxpayer will jump by about $2,200 come Jan. 1. "I want to bring down our deficits, but do it in a balanced, responsible way," he said, later urging Congress to allow lower tax rates enacted during George W. Bush's presidency to remain in effect for the first $250,000 in income, while allowing tax rates incomes that exceed that level to expire."Everybody says they agree with it, so let's get it done," Obama said of keeping the lower rates for the middle class."I've said I will work with Republican on a plan for economic growth, job creation and reducing the deficit," Obama said. "I'm willing to compromise."But lawmakers must be willing to make investments in America's future, such as education, research and development."Our economic success never come from [the] top down; it came from middle out," Obama said.Meanwhile, Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., said time is running out to act on a plan to avoid the cliff."We're getting down to as late as it's physically possible to actually turn a framework into enactable legislation and then actually get it passed," Coons told The Washington Post."For senators to responsibly vote on a big, bold framework or package, we need time to review, debate and discuss this. And we are rapidly running out of running room," he said, explaining he anticipated a complex bill with "many real consequences for average Americans' lives."His comments came after Obama met privately at the White House Sunday with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in their first face-to-face meeting in nearly a month.It was also their first one-on-one session since July 2011, when they tried to forge a far-reaching "grand bargain" on taxes and spending.Neither side would provide details, but the White House and Boehner's office issued identical statements afterward saying "the lines of communication remain open."Disclosure of the meeting indicated private discussions were moving forward despite political theatrics and threats from both sides, the Los Angeles Times said.Economists warn the broad tax increases, combined with across-the-board deep spending cuts for virtually every government program and department, could cause the economy slip back into recession.

View Larger Map	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico, July 6 (UPI) -- A Mexican federal court has denied the final appeal of two U.S. citizens jailed in Ciudad Juarez on drug-trafficking charges, the men's families say.Shohn Huckabee and Carlos Quijas were sentenced to five years in early 2010 after Mexican soldiers said they found about 110 pounds of marijuana in Huckabee's vehicle. The men say the drugs were not theirs and the Mexican army tortured them.Huckabee's father, Kevin, told the El Paso (Texas) Times Tuesday the case was transferred to Culiacan, Sinaloa, but the judge there "has done the same as the ones in Juarez -- they have said one thing and done another." Other inmates in Juarez with similar cases have filed petitions and won release, he said. "The only difference I can think of is that they are American," Huckabee said. The father said he may go to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, but the most likely option is to seek to transfer Shohn Huckabee to a U.S. prison.Shohn Huckabee has previously rejected the idea because it would mean admitting guilt and incurring a permanent U.S. criminal record.

Aug. 28 (UPI) -- It's not every day you see Queen Elizabeth out and about, decked in any less than her usual precisely matched dress coats and hats, chauffeured in some kind of limo.But apparently Her Majesty wanted to go out for a drive, taking the wheel of the Range Rover herself. Officially listed as 5 feet 4 inches (although likely considerably shorter at 86 than when she was measured in 1945), her nose barely cleared the steering wheel. Even better, she appeared to be wearing a hoodie--a hooded sweatshirt more commonly seen on the backs of surly teenagers than the ceremonial head of the British Commonwealth.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyQueen Elizabeth seems to be letting the public see more of her famed sense of humor these days, most notably taking part in an Olympics opening ceremonies stunt that appeared to send her parachuting out of a helicopter at James Bond's side.Perhaps, on the heels of Prince Harry's latest publicity SNAFU, as photos surfaced of him naked in Las Vegas, she's simply engaging in a little teenage rebellion of her own. More likely, though, she's just protecting the royal coiffure from the misty London weather.

Wiki
Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American recording artist, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, the Guinness World Records cited her as the most-awarded female act of all-time.[1] Houston was also one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 170 million albums, singles and videos worldwide.[2][3] She released seven studio albums and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for "How Will I Know",[4] influenced several African-American female artists to follow in her footsteps.[5][6]
Houston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits.[7] She is the second artist behind Elton John and the only female artist to have two number-one Billboard 200 Album awards (formerly "Top Pop Album") on the Billboard magazine year-end charts.[8] Houston's 1985 debut album Whitney Houston became the best-selling debut album by a female act at the time of its release. The album was named Rolling Stone's best album of 1986, and was ranked at number 254 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[9] Her second studio album Whitney (1987) became the first album by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[9]
Houston's first acting role was as the star of the feature film The Bodyguard (1992). The film's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its lead single "I Will Always Love You", became the best-selling single by a female artist in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period under Nielsen SoundScan system.[9] The album makes her the top female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996). The Preacher's Wife soundtrack became the best-selling gospel album in history.[10]
On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead in her guest room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, in Beverly Hills, California, of causes not immediately known.[11] News of her death, the day before and after the 2012 Grammy Awards, featured prominently in American and international media.[12]	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
