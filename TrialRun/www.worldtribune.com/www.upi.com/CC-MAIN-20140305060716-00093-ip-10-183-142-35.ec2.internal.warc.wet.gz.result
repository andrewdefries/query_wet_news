| License Photo	NEW YORK, Nov. 27 (UPI) -- Famed Broadway theater impresario Gerald Schoenfeld has died at his home in New York at the age of 84, the Shubert Organization said.The New York native and World War II veteran had been chairman of the organization since 1972. The group owns and operates one Off-Broadway and 17 Broadway theaters, as well as the Shubert Theater in Boston and the Forrest Theater in Philadelphia. It also manages the National Theater in Washington. Schoenfeld was also the head of the nonprofit Shubert Foundation.The New York Times said the cause of Schoenfeld's death Tuesday has not been released."I suppose as far as the decision goes to do a play or not do it, we do have tremendous power," Schoenfeld, a graduate of the University of Illinois, once told The Washington Post. "It's the ultimate decision. But beyond that, we're the ones who solicit the major authors, the major creative people, the major directors. For all this power we supposedly have, we're really wooing them. You have to woo a Michael Bennett or a Bob Fosse."Schoenfeld is survived by Pat, his wife of 58 years; a brother, Irving; a daughter, Carrie Schoenfeld-Guglielmi, and two grandchildren, the Times said.

$125K reward in steak hair case thrown outWEST BEND, Wis., Dec. 6 (UPI) -- A Wisconsin court tossed out the $125,000 awarded to a man who discovered a facial or public hair had been placed on his steak.The state Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday Circuit Judge Andrew Gonring erred in upholding the reward the jury bestowed on Kevin Hansen, despite the jury's 2010 verdict failing to find the Texas Roadhouse restaurant in West Bend negligent in failing to fire the cook directly after the incident, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Thursday.Hansen accused the cook of placing a facial or public hair on his steak in February 2008 after he complained his first cut of meat had been overcooked.The cook was sentenced to six months in jail and two years of probation after pleading guilty to putting foreign objects in edibles.Florida offers prizes for python huntersDAVIE, Fla., Dec. 6 (UPI) -- Florida wildlife officials are fighting Burmese pythons with a contest offering $1,000 and $1,500 prizes for catching the snakes.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission said the 2013 Python Challenge, which begins Jan. 12, will offer $1,000 to the winner who catches the longest Burmese python on public hunting lands and $1,500 for the participant who catches the largest amount of the snakes, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Thursday.Officials said Jan. 12 will feature a daylong open house on the pythons and other invasive species at the University of Florida's Davie campus."The (Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission) is encouraging the public to get involved in helping us remove Burmese pythons from public lands in south Florida," said Kristen Sommers, head of the commission's Exotic Species Coordination Section. "By enlisting both the public and Florida's python permit holders in a month-long competitive harvesting of Burmese pythons, we hope to motivate more people to find and harvest these large, invasive snakes."Restaurant gives out free TwinkiesORLAND PARK, Ill., Dec. 6 (UPI) -- An Illinois restaurant drew in business by giving away Twinkies, the cake snacks made by defunct company Hostess, with every purchase.Baby's Cheesesteak & Lemonade stocked 12,000 Hostess Twinkies and CupCakes for the giveaways Wednesday at its Orland Park and Country Club Hills locations, the Chicago Tribune reported Thursday.Andres Deleon, Baby's social media director, said owner Hani Sughayer went to a Hostess and Wonder Bread bakery outlet in Hazel Crest and bought out their supply for the promotion."We're really just trying to get a social media buzz out of the whole thing," Deleon said. "The brand recognition is just going to come with it."Hani Sughayer said more than half the Twinkie supply was exhausted by 4:30 p.m.800-pound elk statue stolenRUTHERFORD, N.J., Dec. 6 (UPI) -- Members of an Elks lodge in New Jersey said someone stole an 800-pound statue of an elk from atop their building.Elks Lodge 547 in Rutherford said the elk statue that adorned the roof of the lodge for more than 60 years was taken recently after members laid it on its side and removed its head to protect it from falling in the strong winds, WCBS-TV, New York, reported Thursday.Members said the thieves must have thought they could make money selling the statue for scrap metal."They broke it into smaller pieces and threw it over the roof in different spots," lodge treasurer Joe Europa said. "It's just senseless they did thousands of dollars' worth of damage to the building for an elk that's probably worth maybe $100, and if they needed something we would have gladly given it to them."The lodge is raising money for a new statue to be made from aluminum and plastic.

FRISCO, Texas, March 2 (UPI) -- Jackson's goal on a mistake by Colorado goalkeeper Steward Ceus in the 11th minute Saturday was enough to give FC Dallas a 1-0 season-opening victory.Ceus, playing in place of the injured Matt Pickens, came out the box to gather in a long ball played by Dallas' David Ferreira, but it skipped over his head, allowing Jackson to easily score into an empty net.Dallas (1-0-0) improved to 8-4-6 all-time on opening days with the victory.Atiba Harris had the best scoring chance for Colorado (0-1-0) in the 58th minute on a shot from 25 yards out that got past Dallas goalkeeper Raul Fernandez but missed the net.

Yeldon provided 108 rushing yards and a score on 21 carries for the victors.On defense, Alabama held the Fighting Irish to just 32 rushing yards as the Crimson Tide reeled off a fourth straight win following their only loss of the season Nov. 10 against Texas A&M.Everett Golson completed 21-of-36 passes for 270 yards, a touchdown and an interception for the Irish (12-1), whose hopes for a perfect season and their first national title since 1988 were dashed.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (UPI) -- Recent missile launches by North Korea haven't led to additional security concerns on the Korean Peninsula, a U.S. government spokesman said.The Yonhap news agency in South Korea reported that Monday marked the third consecutive day that North Korea launched short-range missiles over the Sea of Japan.A North Korean underground test of a nuclear device in February sparked concerns about the security situation in the region. Tensions escalated further during joint U.S.-South Korean drills, though the situation had calmed down in recent weeks.A South Korean defense official told Yonhap on condition of anonymity that the launch was seen as an effort to "renew military tensions on the Korean Peninsula."U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said North Korea was called on to urge restraint. The overall security situation was unchanged, however."I'm not aware that we've given any new update to American citizens in South Korea or anything of that nature," he said.Ventrell added that Robert King, a U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights, had to cancel a visit to Seoul and Tokyo because of a "logistical matter."North Korea is suspected of supporting its military arsenal to the detriment of the welfare of its people.

| License Photo	MIAMI, Feb. 4 (UPI) -- A tip involving U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic has led to a dead end, The Miami Herald reported.A week after the tip exploded in the media, the alleged prostitutes have disappeared, the Herald said. An attorney who used to represent two of the women allegedly involved said he hadn't spoken to them in months before he stopped phone calls himself. An apartment in Santo Domingo where some of the alleged assignations took place is vacant.Nothing concrete has tied Menendez and any prostitutes, the Herald first reported Saturday but the allegations were serious enough to initiate an FBI investigation and there is evidence that, at the very least, the women the tipster described exist.In April emails to a watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the tipster, calling himself Peter Williams, alleged Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye surgeon, friend and major campaign donor to Menendez, rented a unit for a Brazilian prostitute named Maria and a Colombian prostitute named Geraldine. The Herald said a call to the apartment building's landlady confirmed two women with those names and from those countries lived there, but they were exchange students who abandoned the apartment. The landlady also had never heard of Menendez or Melgen visiting the apartment.Prostitution is not illegal in the Dominican Republic. The FBI investigation also is looking into trips Menendez took on Melgen's private plane, and the senator's gift disclosures. Last week, Menendez acknowledged that he went to the Dominican Republic with Melgen three times and wrote a check for more than $58,000 to reimburse him for two flights.Separately, the agency is investigating Melgen for possible Medicare fraud. Last week, FBI agents raided Melgen's eye clinic in West Palm Beach.The emails Williams sent to authorities have been greeted with some doubt, in part because he has been unwilling to meet with investigators or talk over the phone, the Herald said. Both Menendez and Melgen have denied wrongdoing.

JUBA, South Sudan, June 25 (UPI) -- The United Nations called on South Sudan to develop a plan to curb ethnic violence that claimed 900 lives, a statement said Monday.Findings compiled by the U.N. Mission in South Sudan and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights were released in a report Monday, documenting the crimes and incidents between the Murle and Lou Nuer ethnic groups in South Sudan's Jonglei state in 2011 and 2012, the statement said.The report says 6,000 to 8,000 armed youths of the Lou Nuer group launched a 12-day attack on the Murle, who organized and retaliated. The violence led to deaths, abductions of women and children, destruction of homes and the displacement of thousands of people.The report called for immediate government action, including the prosecution of those responsible and activation of a government investigation, the statement said."To end the cycle of violence in Jonglei for good, we need to understand what happened and make sure that the perpetrators are held accountable," she said in a statement. "This needs to be part of a comprehensive peace process in the state."U.N. delegates visited regional areas afflicted by conflict alongside members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, South Sudan's military. The agency said their help was indispensable, but delays in SPLA intervention left many civilians vulnerable.South Sudan gained independence last year under the terms of a peace agreement with Khartoum. Oil disputes, border conflicts and ethnic tensions are threatening the deal, however.

DOKKI, Egypt, Jan. 22 (UPI) -- Demonstrators and police clashed in front of Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil's home after a sit-in protesting unemployment in the country, officials said.The April 6 Youth Movement had arranged the week-long sit-in in Dokki to protest to rising unemployment, Egypt Independent reported Monday. At least 3.4 million Egyptians were unemployed during the second half of 2012, reports by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics indicated.Police said they arrested April 6 member Mohamed al-Assad after he allegedly threw a gasoline bomb at a police truck at Qandil's home. Another April 6 member, Mohamed Kamal, said al-Assad was not responsible for the incident because it was an infiltrator hired at the scene who threw the improvised explosive.Twelve other people at the sit-in were also arrested, al-Ahram Online reported.

LONDON, Feb. 14 (UPI) -- Communities in southern, southwest and central Britain prepared for flooding with the threat of heavy rains Friday into Saturday, weather experts said.Cities along the Thames River in Surrey were at a high risk of flooding Britain's Environmental Agency said. The Thames has recorded some of its highest levels in 60 years.The storm has been blamed for at least one death Friday, a 77-year-old man who was hit by a falling tree, the Daily Telegraph said.Seventeen severe flood warnings have been issued and at least 16,000 homes were without power, the London Evening Standard said.British Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to "fight on every front to help people" in a "massive national effort."Prince William suggested reporters reporting on flooding in the city of Datchet should "come and help" as he and Prince Harry joined the armed forces' sandbagging effort, the Telegraph said.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Queen Elizabeth II contributed feed and bedding from the royal farms at Windsor to Somerset farmers affected by the flooding.Winds brought down high-voltage power lines in Wales, sparking a huge fire on a peat bog, officials said. Weather officials posted a weather warning for high winds in the southeast.Scientists said the red squirrel habitat in Durham county has been decimated because thousands of trees have been toppled by the winds. The red squirrel is a protected species.Since Jan. 29, more than 181,000 homes have been protected and at least 200,000 homes have been sent a flood warning following the wettest January since 1766, the agency said.Water levels have been monitored so flood warnings could be issued quickly, officials said. Sandbags and temporary barriers have been placed along riverbanks, but government officials warned residents in flood alert areas to be prepared for flooding.Chris Bainger of the Environmental Agency said Alney Island could expect "some over-topping of [temporary barriers], which is linked to a tidal surge coming up the river and also the fluvial water coming down and coming together in this area." Cameron visited Blackpool Friday on his latest leg in touring flood-hit areas, repeating his pledge that money was "no object" for relief efforts. He also acknowledged that the extreme weather would "have an effect" on Britain's economy.

Oct. 9 (UPI) -- Update (October 14, 1:42 p.m.)Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner passes 120,000 feet and is moments away from his free fall. Update (October 10, 1:40 p.m.)Due to weather concerns, the soonest a second launch attempt will come no sooner than Sunday.Meteorologist Don Day confirmed a Thursday launch is not possible. The next weather window opens on Sunday October 14th.— Red Bull Stratos (@RedBullStratos) October 10, 2012
Update (October 9, 2:00 p.m.)Tuesday's attempt at launch has been aborted, due to high winds that would endanger the balloon and capsule as it attempted to begin its 22-mile journey up.Original post followsHumans, at least the ones with the daredevil gene, keep pushing the boundaries on higher, faster, further.Tuesday, with the help of the Red Bull Stratos mission, skydiver Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner is looking to break a few of records by going higher and faster than any human has gone before, at least without the aid of a vehicle.After a brief delay due to weather, the preparation for the mission was underway Tuesday morning to lay out the balloon that will take Baumgartner more than 22 miles (36.5 km) above Roswell, New Mexico--to the very edge of Earth's atmosphere.If all goes according to plan, Baumgartner will jump out of a pressurized capsule into a near-vacuum atmosphere, accelerating from zero to 690 miles per hour in just 40 seconds. While the ascent to 120,000 feet will take three hours, the return trip to Earth will happen in just 10 minutes.He'll be wearing a specialized space suit to protect his body from the pressure of falling at supersonic speeds, but if he fails to get into an exact "delta position" (hands at his side an his head low), he could begin to spin uncontrollably.“If something goes wrong, the only thing that might help you is God,” Baumgartner said. “Because if you run out of luck, if you run out of skills, there is nothing left and you have to really hope he is not going to let you down.”The current record was set in 1960 by Air Force Colonel Joseph Kittinger, from a height of 102,800 feet.Watch the live stream of the free fall (technically, with a 20 second delay, in case of a tragedy):Tweets by @RedBullStratos

Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner lands safely on Earth after breaking the world record for highest and fastest free fall from over 120,000 feet. Activity lead Bobak Ferdowsi, who cuts his hair differently for each mission, works inside the Spaceflight Operations Facility for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California on August 5, 2012. The Curiosity robot is equipped with a nuclear-powered lab capable of vaporizing rocks and ingesting soil, measuring habitability, and potentially paving the way for human exploration, and was designed to assess whether Mars ever had an environment able to support small life forms called microbes.

| License Photo	Jan. 31 (UPI) -- Hello, Hamptons! Meet Mary Lee, the great white shark that's just hanging out offshore like a real-life Jaws.But have no fear, Montauk. The good people of OCEARCH, the nonprofit Global Shark Tracker, are keeping a good eye on her, and other great whites around the world.According to the East Hampton Patch, Mary Lee was first picked up on Tuesday at 6:04 p.m., when she came within 20 nautical miles of Quogue. She then turned eastward, and was at one point Wednesday afternoon about 40 nautical miles off of Montauk point, but has since headed away from the coast.OCEARCH first tagged Mary Lee in September in Cape Cod, and named her after founder Chris Fischer's mother. "I was waiting and waiting for a special shark to name after her and this is truly the most historic and legendary fish I have ever been a part of and it set the tone for Cape Cod," Fischer said, of Mary Lee, in her shark profile on the side.Since she was first tagged, Mary Lee has spent the past few months traveling the eastern seaboard of the U.S., getting as far south as Ponte Vedra near Jacksonville, Fla. She's a mature shark--measuring 16 feet in length and weighing in at nearly 3500 pounds. She could be anywhere from 20 years old to 70, but there's no way to tell the age of a living shark--a dead shark's spinal cord has rings that can be counted, much in the same way the rings of a tree can give away its age.OCEARCH gets a ping on one of their 35 tagged sharks each time her dorsal fin breaks the surface of the water. Mary Lee, Fischer said, is a particularly coastal fish, unlike most of the sharks who "swim out in the ocean and we don't hear from them much."Great whites can be found in oceans the world over--anywhere with water temperatures between 54 and 75°F. Despite their reputation as "man eater," most great white attacks on humans appear to be accidental or cases of mistaken identity, where the shark mistakes a swimmer, surfer or a small boat for tastier prey--and almost always non-fatal.A Montauk shark may have touched off the fear of great whites that comes from Jaws, but Fischer hopes learning more about the sharks and their still mysterious habits will help debunk some of the worst of the myths."We hope people become more enlightened and a conversation is started, especially since we opened up this tracker for the world to see," he said. "When we think of a great white, we usually think of 'Jaws' music, but now people are asking what is she doing? Where is she going?"
