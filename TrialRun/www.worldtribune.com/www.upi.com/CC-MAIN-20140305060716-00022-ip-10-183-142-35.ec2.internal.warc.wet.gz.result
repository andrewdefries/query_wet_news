TOKYO, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- A Japanese report on a problem with a battery in a Boeing Dreamliner 787 says that a system designed to separate battery cells prevented a bigger problem. The interim Transport Ministry report released Friday said that a cell next to the one that began smoking partly melted, the Wall Street Journal reported. But the report said there was no drop in voltage in that cell.The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 787 Dreamliners in the United States in January 2013 after fires related to the battery unit, and some other countries followed suit. The separation of the battery cells was aimed at correcting the problem. A lithium-ion battery unit in a Japan Air Lines Dreamliner began smoking while the plane was parked at Narita Airport in Tokyo, about to take off for Bangkok. Investigators said they found one of the cells swollen and with electrolyte evaporated.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, June 19 (UPI) -- Earning a college degree may make the difference for women in getting health insurance, compared to those with a high-school degree, U.S. researchers said.Lead author Roberta Wyn of the University of California, Los Angeles, said the study found women without a high-school diploma were nearly four times more likely to be uninsured as women with a college degree.Wyn and colleagues found that in California in 2007, 2.5 million women ages 18-64 were uninsured at some time of the year.The study found 75 percent of women with a college degree had health insurance from an employer, compared with 49 percent of those with a high-school degree and 23 percent of those who had not graduated high school.In addition, 42 percent of the women without a high-school degree did not have health insurance, in contrast to 11 percent of college-educated women, the study said."Health insurance coverage and education are clearly linked," Wyn said in a statement.

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y., Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Playing for the first time this season, Doug Flutie guided his team to the tying score in the fourth quarter Sunday, but Travis Henry capped a big day with a 26-yard touchdown run, leading the Buffalo Bills to a 20-13 victory over the San Diego Chargers.LaDainian Tomlinson carried 28 times for 110 yards and a touchdown, but the Chargers (8-6) wasted a chance to catch the Oakland Raiders (9-5) atop the AFC West, losing for the fifth time in seven games.The Bills (7-7) had lost four of their previous five. They are mathematically alive for the postseason but need a lot of help.Let go by Buffalo after the 2000 season, Flutie took his first snap of the year in the fourth quarter and led a 53-yard drive that culminated in a 53-yard field goal by Steve Christie -- another former Bill -- with 6:45 left.Flutie, who was a cult figure during his three-year stint with the Bills, was greeted by a rousing ovation from the wind-chilled crowd of 61,838 at Ralph Wilson Stadium."It was fun to hear it from the crowd, step into a situation where we are behind and we have an opportunity to go out and win a ballgame," Flutie said. "Made a couple of plays, got us in position. Didn't follow through on it."The Chargers went three-and-out on their next possession before Henry capped a 64-yard scoring drive with his second touchdown of the day. Henry carried 22 times for 144 yards as Buffalo overcame a 101-yard passing day by Drew Bledsoe."We have been talking about it a lot, that this team needs to rise up and play around Drew," Bills coach Gregg Williams said. "We shouldn't always have to lean on Drew. Our team needs to get better around him."Bledose completed only 11 of 33 passes and finished with his worst yardage total since he threw for 101 against the Bills as a member of the New England Patriots on Dec. 26, 1999."They came in with a plan they were going to harass our guys, try and get an extra defender in the box and then try and harass our receivers outside," Bledsoe said.Bledsoe still set his fourth single-season team passing record in his first year with the Bills, surpassing Hall of Famer Jim Kelly's mark for yards (3,844). Bledsoe now has 3,949."He's a hero of mine and anytime you can put your name up next to his, it's a positive thing," said Bledsoe, who also set records for consecutive passes without an interception (175), most yards in a game (463), fastest quarterback to 3,000 yards (10 games) and 300-yard games (7). "I'm proud of that."Henry reached 100 yards for the sixthtime this season."I would hope I get the recognition," he said. "It's something that I work for, respect. Something I want people to know that I'm one of the top backs in this league, too."Henry scored from four yards late in the first quarter to give the Bills a 7-3 lead. He had runs of 10 and 18 yards on the drive."I think their strategy was to put a lot of pressure on us and make us throw a lot," Bills wideout Eric Moulds said. "They had a great game plan coming in, but I think we were able to overcome it by the way Travis was able to run the ball."Henry has 13 rushing touchdowns this season, three off O.J. Simpson's single-season team record. Cookie Gilchrist also had 13 in 1962.The Chargers helped Buffalo's first touchdown drive with a pair of pass interference penalties. They were whistled four times for pass interference and totaled nine penalties for 121 yards."Defensively, we played well, except we had penalties, and you can't do that and be successful in this league," Coach Marty Schottenheimer said.After Mike Hollis kicked a 41-yard field goal early in the second quarter, Tomlinson scored on a one-yard run with 3:21 left in the half to tie it at 10-10. The Bills took a 13-10 lead into the locker room following Hollis' 36-yard field goal.The teams went scoreless in the third quarter as neither was able to move the ball through the gusts. Schottenheimer then decided to bench Brees for the more mobile Flutie."I felt in that scenario, in that situation, he'd be able to make plays by his movement," Schottenheimer said. "My decision to change quarterbacks will be driven by instinct as much as anything."Brees, a second-year pro who had taken every snap since he was given the starting job in preseason, was 13 of 24 for 148 yards. Flutie went three of 11 for 64 yards."Doug went in and did a fine job," Brees said. "I know my job is secure. I'm not second-guessing myself, coach or anybody. I'm still very confident. Obviously upset about the loss."Flutie took over with 8:23 to play and immediately threw a 47-yard completion over the middle to Curtis Conway, who juggled the ball three times before coming down with it. Four plays later, Christie kicked the tying field goal.It was the longest kick in more than five years for Christie, who also was let go by the Bills after the 2000 season.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 20 (UPI) -- Angel Pagan doubled home Andres Torres from second with one away in the ninth inning Friday, giving San Francisco a 3-2 victory over San Diego.The Giants won for the first time in four tries, coming through with the game-winning hit off Luke Gregorson (1-2).Gergor Blanco opened the ninth with a single, but he was erased on a force play when Torres was unable to execute a sacrifice.Torres, after reaching first on the failed bunt attempt, stole second and scored when Pagan doubled to right.Santiago Casilla (2-1), the fourth San Francisco pitcher, picked up the win by working the final 1 1/3 innings without giving up a hit.San Diego tied it at 2-2 on a solo homer by Chase Headley in the sixth. The Padres had won their previous three games.

BOSTON, July 28 (UPI) -- A company that admitted supplying substandard concrete to Boston's Big Dig has agreed to pay $50 million to settle the case.Under the agreement, Aggregate Industries NE Inc., will not be barred from bidding on federal and state contracts, The Boston Globe reported. The company, the largest concrete supplier in New England, gets the majority of its business from government jobs.U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said Aggregate Industries probably would not have agreed to a settlement if it meant being banned from bidding on projects. An attorney for the company said that would have forced the parent company to shut Aggregate down.Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Sullivan advocate using $27 million from the settlement for a fund to pay for future maintenance on the Big Dig, the biggest urban highway project ever.The project, already plagued by cost overruns and delays, became notorious when a chunk of concrete fell on a moving car, killing a woman.

SAN ANTONIO, July 21 (UPI) -- A U.S. Air Force boot camp instructor found guilty of rape, sexual assault and other crimes was sentenced Saturday to 20 years in prison.The Air Force charged Staff Sgt. Luis A. Walker with having illicit relationships with 10 women at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio -- all of them in basic training and some in units he oversaw, the San Antonio Express-News reported.Prosecutors called Walker a "sexual predator" and asked he be sentenced to at least 40 years in prison.Walker, 26, will come up for a parole review after completing a third of the sentence, about six years.Walked was flanked by family members including his two boys, ages 4 and 7, when he read a prepared statement. His wife, sister and stepfather pleaded for leniency. Five of his victims tearfully described how the encounters with Walker had damaged their lives. Several said they had lost trust in men. Two said they had struggled to maintain relationships and one said she suffers anxiety attacks."I can't be in a room with a male by myself," one victim said. "It's affected my relationship with my dad, it's affected my relationship with my husband, it's affected my relationship with people I haven't met yet."Victims said they first viewed Walker as a friend who wasn't always screaming at them as other instructors did.He later confronted them when he sought sex, and evidence showed he had intercourse with four of the women.There was no physical evidence in the case, only the testimony of the victims, the Express-News said.

After a two-year career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), he played in the minor leagues for three seasons. He was signed by the Canucks in 2005 from their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Burrows established himself as a checking forward with the Canucks in his first three NHL seasons before emerging as a scorer with two consecutive seasons of at least 20 goals and 50 points, beginning in 2008–09.
Before making it to the NHL, Burrows also enjoyed a prolific ball hockey career, competing in national and international tournaments in the summers. In 2005, he was named the International Ball Hockey Player of the Year. He has also been inducted into the Canadian and International Ball Hockey Halls of Fame.
Burrows played two seasons in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Shawinigan Cataractes, beginning in 2000–01.

Wiki
Miikka Sakari Kiprusoff (Finnish pronunciation: ; born October 26, 1976) is a Finnish professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the fifth round, 116th overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He has also played for TPS of the Finnish SM-liiga as well as AIK and Timrå IK of the Swedish Elitserien. He has represented Finland several times on the international stage, earning silver medals at the World Ice Hockey Championships in 1999 and 2001, as well as leading the Finns to a surprise second place finish at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He also helped the Finnish national hockey team win the bronze medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Kiprusoff began his professional career with TPS in 1994, and was named the best goaltender and best player of the playoffs in 1999 as he led them to the SM-liiga championship. He moved to North America in 1999, and after two all-star seasons in the American Hockey League, made his NHL debut with the Sharks where he served primarily as a backup. A trade to Calgary in 2003–04 brought Kiprusoff into a starting role and he set a modern NHL record for lowest goals against average at 1.69 as he helped the Flames reach the 2004 Stanley Cup Final. He won the Vezina Trophy as the best goaltender in the NHL in 2006 along with the William M. Jennings Trophy for giving up the fewest goals in the league. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game in 2007 and is the Flames franchise record holder in shutouts.
Kiprusoff was sponsored by his hometown team, TPS Turku, playing two seasons in the Finnish junior league for them between 1993 and 1995. He was selected by the San Jose Sharks in the fifth round, 116th overall, at the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He made his professional début in 1994–95, and won three of four games played for TPS. After playing 12 games for TPS in 1995–96, he moved to AIK of the Swedish Elitserien, playing two seasons as their top goaltender before returning to TPS in 1998–99. He dominated the SM-liiga that year, finishing the season with a win-loss-tie record of 26–6–6 and a goals against average (GAA) of 1.85, and led TPS to the Finnish championship. For his efforts, he was named the winner of the Urpo Ylönen trophy as the best goaltender in 1998–99 and the Jari Kurri trophy as the best player of the playoffs.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
