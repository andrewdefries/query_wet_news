"The drill results confirm our expectations and show once again that the Norwegian continental shelf still delivers high value barrels."The prospect is situated in the southern Norwegian waters of the North Sea. Haatvedt said it was encouraging to see there were significant oil discoveries remaining on the country's continental shelf."Not only does it have a proud past, but also an exciting future," added Haatvedt.The company said it would look at developmental options for the prospect. It didn't give a time or financial estimate for development.

| License Photo	LAS VEGAS, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- What happens in Vegas goes global if you're Prince Harry and a U.S. gossip Web site posts photos of you horsing around naked during a game of "strip billiards."TMZ published two photos of a naked Harry "during a raging party in a high rollers hotel suite" at the Wynn Las Vegas resort and casino."We're told Harry, along with a large entourage, went down to the hotel bar and met a bunch of hot chicks ... and invited them up to his VIP suite," the celebrity news Web site said.They eventually played strip billiards, a variation of traditional billiards in which players remove clothing when they lose a shot."Some of the partiers snapped photos of the madness," the site said of the Friday bash.In one photo, Harry cups his genitals while a seemingly topless woman in panties stands behind him. In the second, Harry bear-hugs an evidently nude woman from behind.The site did not identify the women.Buckingham Palace confirmed the photos are of the 27-year-old younger son of Prince Charles and Diana, princess of Wales."Prince Harry has been on a private holiday before he resumes his military duties," a palace official told CNN, a sister news organization to TMZ.The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the incident "risks embarrassing Buckingham Palace and raises questions about the prince's security arrangements."Harry, officially Prince Henry of Wales, has recently sought to distance himself from his early-20s image as a "playboy," the newspaper said.He stood in for Queen Elizabeth II at the London Olympics closing ceremony Aug. 12. He was in Washington in May to accept a humanitarian award from former Secretary of State Colin Powell for his work honoring wounded servicemen and women.In the British Army Air Corps, Capt. Harry is a pilot of a four-blade, twin-engine Apache helicopter and has said he wishes to serve in Afghanistan.He is a patron of 10 charities.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 (UPI) -- The American Academy of Pediatrics spells out how the Affordable Care Act affects U.S. children in each state whether currently insured or not, officials say.The AAP at its website, www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/Pages/State-Health-Insurance.aspx, outlines the benefits and protections already available under the Affordable Care Act that include: -- Children age 26 and younger can be covered by a parent's health insurance policy. -- Children age 19 and younger cannot be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition such as a congenital abnormality. -- Families can choose a pediatrician as a child's primary care doctor.-- New private health plans must cover the cost of preventive care such as immunizations. -- Out-of-pocket costs are capped at $5,950/per individual/year and $11,900/per family/year.-- Health insurance companies can no longer set lifetime dollar limits on health benefits.-- Insurance companies can no longer drop people if they get sick.Having health insurance is now a requirement and as of Jan. 1, 2014, almost all Americans will be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty.Consumers need to know that on Jan. 1:-- If you have access to affordable insurance through your employer: you do not need to change insurance coverage if you don't want to.-- If you do not have access to affordable coverage: You can get health insurance through your state's marketplace. Enrollment for new coverage begins Oct. 1, 2013. The marketplace is a new way to get health insurance for you and your family. -- You can buy insurance directly from an insurance company or through a broker, or you can sign up through your new state marketplace. Through the marketplace, you can also find out if you qualify for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. -- Through the marketplace, you can find out what the cost of health insurance will be for you and your family.-- Your application in the health insurance marketplace will tell you if you are eligible for financial assistance to help you buy private insurance. The amount of assistance depends on your family's yearly income. You may also have no cost if you qualify for Medicaid or CHIP.-- The marketplace offers four different levels of health insurance plans. Those least expensive -- bronze -- have fewer benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs. Platinum is the most expensive and has more benefits and lower out-of-pocket costs. Each family or individual can choose the plan that best suits their needs. Families, especially those who have children with special healthcare needs, can make sure the plan they purchase includes: -- Their current pediatrician.-- Access to pediatric specialists and pediatric surgical specialists.-- Preventive care, such as well-child check-ups and immunizations. -- Habilitative services to help a child keep, learn, or improve functioning.-- Rehabilitative services such as physical or speech therapy.-- Vision and dental care. The Kaiser Family Foundation provides federal subsidy estimates under the Affordable Care Act for families and individuals at: http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/.Fox example, a family of four, two adults and two children under age 18, with an annual household income of $42,000, who do not smoke would have an unsubsidized annual family health insurance premium of $9,869 and qualify for a federal tax credit $7,641 -- 77 percent of the family premium -- and pay $2,228 per year for health insurance if their employers did not provide health insurance.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress have mounted unusually early advertising campaigns in the run-up to next year's presidential election."There's a limited time period in which to brand the new Congress," Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told the Washington Post. He leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which last week launched television ads highlighting congressional accomplishments in the seven months Democrats have held the majority.Neil Newhouse, a partner at the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies told the Post Republicans needed an early start on promoting themselves as well."If you look at nothing but the numbers, in terms of mood of the country, the popularity of the president, there's no question the environment has eroded for Republicans since November," Newhouse said.As a result, recent National Republican Congressional Committee radio ads criticized freshman Rep. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., for giving "union organizers more power to intimidate employees" and for voting "for outrageous pork-barrel spending on peanut storage and transporting tropical fish."

PIERRE, S.D., March 9 (UPI) -- South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard has signed a bill authorizing public school districts to allow employees or volunteer guards to carry guns on campus.Daugaard -- who signed the measure Friday -- predicted not many school districts would take advantage of the authorization and give the green light to pistol-packing teachers or so-called security sentinels from the community, The New York Times reported.Teachers and volunteers will be required to undergo an intensive training program similar to what police officers receive."I think it does provide the same safety precautions that a citizen expects when a law enforcement officer enters a premises," Daugaard told the Times.The National Rifle Association proposed armed police officers on school campuses nationwide as the best way to prevent a repeat of the Sand Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December.Critics and advocates of gun control immediately balked at the idea of bringing more loaded guns into schools.Proponents of the South Dakota bill -- the first of its kind in the United States -- said the idea was not particularly radical in their state where many kids are taught at a young age to hunt and handle guns safely.The author of the bill, freshman Republican Rep. Scott Craig, said he hoped South Dakota could reassure doubters."It is safer than they think, it's proactive and it's preventive," he said.

MOSCOW, April 13 (UPI) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has presented two international agreements on children's rights to the State Duma for ratification.The documents -- the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention of the Council of Europe on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse -- both deal with protecting children from exploitation, RIA Novosti reported.The international non-governmental organization ECPAT, which fights the sexual exploitation of children, has been urging Russia to ratify the two documents, citing United Nations Children's Education Fund estimates there are 80,000 to 130,000 sex trade victims in Moscow -- 20 percent to 25 percent of whom are minors.

| License Photo	(UPI) -- Kylie Jenner opened up about her fear of paparazzi in Sunday's episode of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians." The episode, which was shot months ago, finds 16-year-old Kylie surrounded by photographers while she's driving to the family's Malibu beach house with her father Bruce Jenner. In a clip of the incident the then unlicensed reality star tells her father she's afraid to get her license and drive alone because of all the attention she's getting from paparazzi as Kim Kardashian's due date approaches.Though Bruce tried to keep her calm and instructed her to focus on the road and not the paparazzi, he eventually asked her to pull over so he could get out of the car and deal with the photographers. "I don't get mad very often, but these guys are really ticking me off," Bruce says in the voiceover. "I don't want them following my daughter. That's just dangerous."Later in the episode Kourtney Kardashian also complains about paparazzi as she recounts the time Kris Jenner found a photographer in her backyard.

Wiki
John Cameron Fogerty (born May 28, 1945) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist, best known for his time with the swamp rock/roots rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) and as a #1 solo recording artist. Fogerty has a rare distinction of being named on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists at #40 and the list of 100 Greatest Singers at #72. The songs "Proud Mary" and "Born on the Bayou" also rank amongst the Greatest Pop songs ("Proud Mary," #41) and Guitar songs ("Born on the Bayou," #53). Fogerty was born in Berkeley, California and is the younger brother of the late Tom Fogerty. He attended El Cerrito High School along with the other members of CCR.
Inspired by Rock and roll pioneers, especially Little Richard and Bo Diddley, John and his brother Tom Fogerty joined Doug Clifford and Stu Cook in the late 1950s to form the band Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets in El Cerrito, California. After signing with the jazz label Fantasy in 1965, they became the Golliwogs and released a few singles that were largely ignored.
Fogerty was almost drafted in 1966, but instead he joined an Army Reserve unit. He served at Fort Bragg, Fort Knox and Fort Lee. Fogerty was discharged from the Army in July 1967. In the same year, the band changed its name to Creedence Clearwater Revival.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
