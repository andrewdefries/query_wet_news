CANBERRA, Australia, March 29 (UPI) -- Australia will spend more than $15.5 million with Thales for the manufacture of Bushmaster vehicle components as part of a conditional program to buy more units.The components have long lead times for manufacturing and include hulls, axle and suspension systems, fire suppression systems, radiators, gun rings, insulation and hydraulics parts.Thales Australia, formerly ADI, makes the 4x4 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle and components at its factory in Bendigo in the state of Victoria.A statement by Minister for Defense Stephen Smith and Minister for Defense Materiel Jason Clare said the Thales manufacturing capability and the skills of the workforce are an important national security capability that the government wants to ensure remains viable.The army acquired its first batch of 300 Bushmasters starting in August 2004 and delivery of the latest variants started in 2008.Australia has around 700 Bushmasters, many of which are in Afghanistan and are credited with saving numerous Australian soldiers' lives, Smith said.The Bushmaster is available in a range of variants including troop transport, ambulance, direct fire, mortar, engineer and command for application in combat and combat support roles.Powered by Caterpillar 3126E ATAAC turbocharged engine, the vehicle is capable of carrying up to nine soldiers along with their equipment, fuel and supplies for three days, depending on the type of variant.The potential order for more Bushmasters through the $15.5 million injection into Thales Australia is in addition to 101 units the government ordered in May.In December the government announced that to retain the critical manufacturing skills in Bendigo it would explore the purchase of additional Bushmaster vehicles.The $15.5 million "is the next step in that process," the statement by Smith and Clare said."Full approval to acquire additional Bushmasters will be dependent on Thales demonstrating an efficient, effective and innovative program to maintain core protected vehicle manufacturing skills at Bendigo and in successfully meeting technical performance, cost and schedule commitments in the development of the new Hawkei vehicle."The 4x4, 6-crew, 7-ton Hawkei is Thales Australia's next-generation protected vehicle based on the Bushmaster.The government announced in December that the Hawkei vehicle had been selected as the preferred vehicle for development and testing in Australia's search for an improved protected mobility vehicle.Work on the Hawkei is being done under Stage 2 of the Manufactured and Supported in Australia option under LAND 121 Phase 4.LAND 121 Phase 4 is a $1.5 billion project that seeks to provide up to 1,300 protected and unprotected light vehicles for the military.But final government approval and orders for the Hawkei aren't expected before 2015 with production starting in early 2016, a Thales statement said.Thales Australia has worked with Boeing, PAC Group and Plasan, as well as many Australian small and medium-sized businesses to develop the Hawkei, a report on the Thales Web site says.The name Hawkei comes from the Latin name for the deadly adder -- Acanthophis hawkei -- which is native to Australia, Thales said.

WERNERSVILLE, Pa., Nov. 23 (UPI) -- The U.S. reality television series "Jon & Kate Plus 8" ended its five-season run Monday amid the titular couple's sensational divorce.Jon and Kate Gosselin, the parents of eight young children, became the focus of a media firestorm last summer after announcing plans to divorce.Although Kate initially was criticized for her controlling demeanor and sharp tongue, she was seen in a more positive light during her separation from Jon as she stayed home to care for her kids, while Jon was frequently seen partying at night clubs and out on dates.When TLC announced it planned to limit his role on the show, he sued to halt production, claiming it was detrimental to his kids.Attempts to resume work on the show were unsuccessful and the couple were interviewed separately for the last edition of "Jon & Kate Plus 8.""This is a very bittersweet goodbye for me because the kids are already missing it," Kate explained. "I don't like endings. I don't like goodbyes unless it's finishing a term paper or finishing a book."Asked how she feels about wrapping up the show, she confessed: "It's sad. It's needless. It's useless. It was totally avoidable."She said the show gave her children the opportunity to travel, paid for their educations and allowed them to be with their parents, who essentially worked at home for the series.Jon said the last few months helped him be more introspective."I think I've become more educated about myself," he noted. "I never really took blame and now I'm taking blame and I can own up to it. I've gotta stop being a kid. I've gotta grow up one day and take initiative and be a man."He said he regressed after the breakup because he had so much responsibility at such a young age -- marrying at 22, having twins at 23 and becoming the father of sextuplets at 27. "Maybe I reverted back to 23."I had kids my whole 20s and our marriage fell apart and I felt like I was free," he said. "I kinda took advantage of it for awhile and didn't really think about my actions until I started getting paparazzi and written about. That's maturing. That's growing up. ... We're going to strive to be the best parents we can, not for our sake, but for our kids' sakes."

ALBERTINIA, South Africa, May 9 (UPI) -- A South African couple said they adopted a pair of cheetah cubs that have formed a bond with their children, ages 1 and 3.Hein and Kim Schoeman, animal trainers who live and work on an animal reserve in Albertinia, said they adopted cubs Wakku and Skyla about a year ago when their mother was unable to take care of her entire litter of four, ABC News reported Thursday.The couple said the cubs have since bonded strongly with their children, Malan, 3, and Kayla, 1.The couple said their family's relationship with the cheetahs will be the subject of an upcoming documentary titled "Cheetah House.""At the end of the day, it all boils down to how humans and nature can live together and respect each other. That's what it's about," Hein Schoeman said.The couple said they are teaching the cheetahs to hunt so they can one day be released into the wild.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (UPI) -- The real loser last week on Election Day appears to be Karl Rove, who now has to explain to his shadowy billionaire donors how he spent hundreds of millions of dollars in "independent" expenditures on Mitt Romney's behalf and came up a cropper.Two groups associated with Rove and fellow Republican operative Ed Gillespie spent more than $175 million in 2012 alone to promote Romney and other conservative candidates, OpenSecrets.org reported.If a wave of Republicans, particularly Romney, had been elected, Rove would have been seen as a GOP hero and a major voice in the party for years to come. Instead, political watchdogs report, his high-flying efforts went down in flames.The OpenSecrets blog, part of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics operating out of Washington, called Rove's American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS the "heavy hitters" of about 245 outside spenders.The Center for Public Integrity, an investigative journalism non-profit operating out of Washington, said last week more than $1 billion was spent by outside groups by Election Day."Of all outside spending in the 2012 election, more than $450 million was dedicated to the presidential election with more than $350 million spent helping Romney and about $100 million spent to help President Barack Obama," the center reported on its website.All this lavish outside spending is possible, of course, because of the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. The 5-4 ruling lifted restrictions on corporate and union donors for "independent electioneering expenditures."Two months later, using the principles outlined in Citizens United, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled in Speechnow.org vs. FEC that PACs, or political action committees, that did not make direct campaign contributions or donate to other PACs could accept unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and individuals.Theoretically, outside donors were not supposed to coordinate their spending with political campaigns, who had to operate using direct contributions subject to regulation by the Federal Election Commission. And though unions were included in the ruling, their efforts have been swamped by corporate executives contributing money from corporate treasuries to super PACS and to secretive 501(c)(4) organizations -- named for the section of the Tax Code that allows their existence.American Crossroads is a super PAC. But Crossroads GPS (Grassroots Policy Strategies) is a non-profit 501(c)(4) organization that doesn't have to report contributions or contributors to the FEC, unlike super PACS or the individual campaigns. These 501(c)(4) groups are supposed to be "civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare," Tax Code regulations say, "or local associations of employees, the membership of which is limited to the employees of a designated person or persons in a particular municipality, and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational or recreational purposes."Crossroads GPS has 100 donors, all of them secret.Among others, Crossroads GPS sponsored anti-Obama ads and robo-calls by Clint Eastwood. The New York Times said their secrecy allows corporations to donate money to 501(c)(4) groups like Crossroads GPS while "shielding corporate contributors from shareholders or others unhappy with their political positions."The two Rove groups have been active since Citizens United was handed down at the Supreme Court. The Center for Responsive Politics reported the two groups raised $123 million from 2010 through the end of 2011, but the lion's share, $76.8 million, went to the non-profit.This year, the super PAC American Crossroads made more than $104.7 million in "independent expenditures." The non-profit inscrutable Crossroads GPS laid out nearly $71 million in post-Citizen United spending.But the Sunlight Foundation, a non-profit designed to promote political funding transparency, said the Rove organizations did not get much bang for the bucks, to say the least.Of the nearly $103.6 million spent in the general election by American Crossroads, only 1.29 percent "ended in the desired result," a Sunlight report said. The organization supported no winning candidates.For Grassroots GPS, the figures are somewhat better.About 14.4 percent of the non-profit's nearly $71 million spent in the 2012 general election "ended in the desired result," Sunlight reported. None of the candidates supported by the organization won election. The 14.4 percent went to successfully defeating seven candidates.The results were so miserable that instead of presiding over a triumphant Election Night, Rove squabbled on air with Fox News over the network's calling, correctly, Ohio and the election for President Obama. And now that his efforts have proved so futile, Rove's political enemies are moving in, circling like leopards around an injured water buffalo.Major media carried a number of stories last week celebrating Rove's at least temporary political demise.U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., mocked Rove Thursday for his failure to deliver both a promised Senate majority and the White House to Republicans, Politico reported.Schumer told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast: "Karl Rove's reputation is going to take a significant hit. If Crossroads was the business and Karl Rove was the [chief executive officer], he'd be fired for getting a poor return for his investors."Post-election, Rove had argued that his super PAC and 501 group helped hold down Obama's vote in crucial swing states -- even though they didn't deliver those states to Romney."I'm sure he went to [big conservative donors] Sheldon Adelson and to Harold Simmons and said, 'Put up these millions and [Obama will] win, but we'll decrease his margin,'" Schumer scoffed.However, Rove may have a point. The Washington Post points out that Obama victory margins in 10 key states were slim.In contrast to the Rove groups, Sunlight reported, the Republican and Democratic congressional committees had far more success, though in a negative way.The Republican committee spent more than $64.65 million, of which 31.63 percent "ended in the desired result." The committee supported only one winning candidate, but successfully opposed 17 losing candidates.The Democratic group spent more than $61.74 million, of which 39.17 percent "ended in the desired result." The group supported two successful candidates, and successfully opposed 28 losing candidates.Another conservative potentate who may be licking his wounds post-Election Day is Adelson, chief executive of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. and, according to Forbes, the 12th richest American."Money can't buy happiness, nor can it buy an election, apparently," the Center for Public Integrity reported on its website. Adelson was the No. 1 super PAC contributor with more than $53 million and a direct beneficiary of the Speechnow.org ruling in Washington.But he apparently backed a flotilla of losers.Adelson was the top donor to the pro-Romney Restore Our Future super PAC, with $20 million in contributions, the center said. Sources told the New York Times in June Adelson had committed to contributing $10 million to Rove's secretive Grassroots GPS, but since that group does not have to report to the FEC, no one may ever know.Besides Romney, the Jewish-American casino magnate backed losing candidates Connie Mack for the U.S. Senate from Florida, Allen West for the U.S. House from Florida, Joe Kyrillos for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey, Shmuley Boteach for the U.S. House from New Jersey, Newt Gingrich in the GOP presidential primary and David Dewhurst in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate from Texas.Adelson, along with homebuilder Bob Perry, collectively contributed $2.5 million to Independence Virginia, the super PAC backing former Republican U.S. Sen. George Allen. But Allen's opponent, former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine, won the Virginia seat with 52 percent of the vote.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UPI) -- The Republican-led U.S. House approved a bill that would impose tighter restrictions on federal payments for abortions and sent it to the Democratic-led Senate.The 227-188 vote Tuesday was mainly along party lines, with six Democrats voting yes, one Republican voting no and another voting present, the New York Times reported."Here we go again," Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. "It's another battle in the war on women." Republicans, dogged by accusations that they are hostile to women, said Democrats unfairly characterized their intentions."I will say it again," Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said, "we are not attacking women's healthcare."Existing law such as the Hyde Amendment restricts federal financing for abortion services. Since the Hyde Amendment must be renewed annually, Republicans said their proposal merely would codify what has been the law of the land.Some Republicans said they would prefer discussing jobs and the economy rather than an abortion bill, which will go nowhere in the Democratic-majority Senate, the Times said."I've always said that we ought to avoid taking on these hot-button social issues; they don't do us any good," Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said. While he voted for the bill, Dent also noted how some of his colleagues were so ill-prepared to discuss women's health issues that the leadership has had to counsel its members on how to approach the topic with greater sensitivity."Here's my suggestion for a communications strategy for some of these guys," Dent said. "Four words: Shut the bleep up."Some Democrats, too, said they think their party would be better served discussing jobs and the economy, the Times said."I'm a skeptic," said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt. "The people we represent need jobs, need better incomes and want us to focus on the economy. To the extent that we get involved in issues that take us away from that, it legitimately undercuts our credibility."

BEIJING, Nov. 8 (UPI) -- Chinese police Friday arrested a suspect in explosions that killed one person and injured eight others in northern Shanxi province.The official Xinhua News Agency quoted police as saying the suspect, identified as Feng Zhijun, is a resident of the provincial capital of Taiyuan, and that he had admitted to setting off the Wednesday blasts with homemade devices in front of the office building of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Police said ball bearings and circuit boards were found at the scene.Police said they found homemade bombs in Feng's residence and seized the vehicle they said they believe he used at the time of the explosions.The report said Feng previously served nine years in prison for theft.Last week, a vehicle ploughed into a crowd in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and police later said it was a terrorist attack planned by ethnic Uighur Muslim extremists from the northwest regions of Xinjiang. The vehicle's three occupants and two more in the crowd died in the incident.

Wiki
Alice Stokes Paul (January 11, 1885 – July 9, 1977) was an American suffragist leader. Along with Lucy Burns (a close friend) and others, she led a successful campaign for women's suffrage that resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.
Paul was born into a Quaker family at Paulsdale in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. She was the first-born child of William Mickle Paul I (1850-1902) and Tacie Parry. Her father was a banker and businessman who served as president of the Burlington County Trust Company. Alice had two brothers, William Mickle Paul II (1886-1958) and Parry Haines, and a sister, Helen (1889-1961).
In 1901, she graduated first in her class from the Moorestown Friends School. She later attended Swarthmore College (BA, 1905), the New York School of Philanthropy (social work), and the University of Pennsylvania (MA, sociology). In 1907, she moved to England where she attended the University of Birmingham and the London School of Economics (LSE). Returning to the U.S. in 1910, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, completing a PhD in political science in 1912. Her dissertation topic was titled The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania. In 1927, she received an LLM, followed by a Doctor of Civil Law degree in 1928, both from American University's Washington College of Law.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
