BRUSSELS, April 25 (UPI) -- The expected heir to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will seek to strengthen energy ties to Europe during an upcoming visit, officials said this week. Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang will make a stop in Brussels to meet with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso during a five-day state visit beginning April 30, a top Chinese diplomat said Monday. Li, who is poised to take over from Wen as China's next premier, says there is "great potential" for China and Europe to step up cooperation in energy, especially in advanced technology for conservation and environmental protection, the state news agency Xinhua reported.Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Song Tao said Li would visit Hungary, Belgium and EU headquarters in Brussels next week. As part of the trip, he will confer with Belgian King Albert II and Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo. While in Hungary, Li is to sign agreements on finance, small business and agricultural technology.China's need to conserve energy is becoming more acute with its accelerating rate of urbanization. In 1990, 26 percent of Chinese lived in cities, while last year the rate was approaching 52 percent -- some 691 million people.Song said Li will ask the EU leaders about how advanced energy technologies help Europe handle its own urbanization rate of 72.6 percent. Coping with quickly rising city populations is a chief concern of Beijing's 12th five-year plan and the issue "will define China's economic growth," the diplomat said.Beijing is also looking to tap Europe for technological expertise in geothermal energy. One of the motivations behind Wen's visit to Iceland last week was to promote bilateral cooperation in the field.China, which has abundant geothermal resources, has sent a "considerable" number of technicians to Iceland for training on how to tap the supplies and is looking to gain more expertise in geothermal utilization, Wen said.The current premier is expected to cede to Li as China's No. 2 leader in October. Xi Xiping is seen as successor to President Hu Jintao, who occupies the most powerful political position in China.Under that scenario, Li would become the most important figure for interactions with Europe and EU leaders see his early visit as a sign of Beijing's intention to strengthen ties with Europe despite the eurozone crisis, the Brussels daily Europolitics reported."The eurozone crisis is a negative story, but it has also demonstrated to the Chinese their economic dependence on the EU market," an unnamed EU official told the newspaper. "In some way, the crisis has made the EU more relevant than ever."Because the EU is China's largest trading partner, Beijing "has a direct interest" in seeing the eurozone overcome its debt crisis and bounce back, the official said.Li has already visited Britain, Germany and Spain this year.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, May 3 (UPI) -- Film director Roman Polanski, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, says the United States wants to extradite him to "serve me on a platter to the media." The 76-year-old Oscar winner has been under house arrest since December 2009 while he awaits a decision regarding whether he will be extradited to the United States in the decades-old case in which he was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. He was held in a Swiss jail for nearly two months before he posted bail and was placed under house arrest.The filmmaker, who had been living in France but was in Switzerland to attend a film festival at the time of his arrest last year, has not traveled to the United States since he pleaded guilty in Los Angeles to having unlawful sex with a minor. He fled the United States before he could be sentenced.Polanski's lawyers have alleged misconduct on the part of the Los Angeles criminal justice system at the time of the plea deal and are fighting extradition from Switzerland to the United States.Polanski spoke about the situation during the weekend for the first time since his arrest last year."I can no longer remain silent because the United States continues to demand my extradition more to serve me on a platter to the media of the world than to pronounce a judgment concerning which an agreement was reached 33 years ago," E! News quoted Polanski as saying in a statement. "I have had my share of dramas and joys, as we all have, and I am not going to try to ask you to pity my lot in life. I ask only to be treated fairly like anyone else," he continued. "It is true: 33 years ago I pleaded guilty, and I served time at the prison for common law crimes at Chino, not in a VIP prison. That period was to have covered the totality of my sentence. By the time I left prison, the judge had changed his mind and claimed that the time served at Chino did not fulfill the entire sentence, and it is this reversal that justified my leaving the United States."

ROCHESTER, Minn., April 24 (UPI) -- U.S. women age 40 and under have been diagnosed with melanoma eight times more frequently than in the previous four decades, researchers say.Dr. Jerry Brewer of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said men were diagnosed with melanoma four times as often as the previous 40 years.The reason the rate of skin cancer for woman has spiked at twice the pace as that of men, Brewer said, is because women have been spending more time in the sun getting tanned and using tanning beds.Brewer said melanoma is treatable and survivable "if you find it early enough.""Treatment has improved as cases have gone up," Brewer said in a statement. "Early detection is key. See a dermatologist. That could save your life."The study was published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, May 25 (UPI) -- Researchers at the University of Southern California found a class of pharmaceuticals they say can both prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease in mice.Lead researcher Christian Pike of the USC Davis School of Gerontology said the drugs, known as "TSPO ligands," are currently used for certain types of neuroimaging."We looked at the effects of TSPO ligand in young adult mice when pathology was at an early stage, and in aged mice when pathology was quite severe," Pike said in a statement. "TSPO ligand reduced measures of pathology and improved behavior at both ages."The team's findings, published online in the Journal of Neuroscience, found four treatments -- once per week over four weeks -- in older mice resulted in a significant decrease of Alzheimer's-related symptoms and improvements in memory, meaning that TSPO ligands may actually reverse some elements of Alzheimer's disease.Pike and co-authors include USC postdoctoral scientists Anna M. Barron, Anusha Jayaraman and Joo-Won Lee; as well as Donatella Caruso and Roberto C. Melcangi of the University of Milan and Luis M. Garcia-Segura of the Instituto Cajal in Spain, said the data suggested the possibility the drugs could prevent and treat Alzheimer's. "It's just mouse data, but extremely encouraging mouse data," Pikes said. "There is a strong possibility that TSPO ligands similar to the ones used in our study could be evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in Alzheimer's patients within the next few years."

ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- An EU spokesman said there may be offers on the table for Iran to "show some flexibility" with its nuclear program.Representatives from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Iran met this week in Kazakhstan for nuclear negotiations.Some in international community suspect Iran is pursuing the technology needed to manufacture a nuclear weapon, an allegation the Iranians deny.Before leaving for the summit, Iran's nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said Western leaders should have "a new strategy free from previous mistakes," the semiofficial Fars News Agency reports.Multilateral negotiations ended in July with few breakthroughs. International inspectors visited Iran this year but were unable to allay their concerns about potential nuclear work at the Parchin military complex outside Tehran.EU spokesman Michael Mann was quoted by the BBC as saying talks were held in the spirit of compromise."We've put some proposals forward which will hopefully allow Iran to show some flexibility," he said.A headline from Iran's official news agency, IRNA, states that Tehran has taken the "upper hand in Almaty nuclear talks."Negotiations are to resume Wednesday.

| License Photo	BOSTON, April 17 (UPI) -- The FBI said Wednesday afternoon no arrest has been made in the Boston Marathon bombings, despite numerous media reports."Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack," the FBI said on its website. "Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting."Also Wednesday, the White House said President Obama and the first lady will travel to Boston Thursday to attend "Healing Our City: An Interfaith Service" dedicated to those who were gravely wounded or killed in Monday's bombing near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Meanwhile, security officials ordered an evacuation at the Moakley Federal Courthouse in Boston, but did not give details. Offices are routinely evacuated after telephoned bomb threats.Before the FBI knocked down the reports, CNN and other news outlets, citing sources they did not name, had been reporting investigators have identified and arrested a suspect in the bombings that killed three and injured 175.The sources said the suspect, described as a "dark-skinned male," was picked up on security camera video from the Lord & Taylor department store along the marathon route, very near the second explosion.Earlier, investigators found a lid to a pressure cooker police said they think was used for one of the bombs, CNN reported.Citing a federal law enforcement source it described as having firsthand knowledge of the investigation, CNN said investigators found the item on the roof of a building near where the bombs went off.The FBI was seeking leads into who may have been responsible for the attack, combing through photos and videos taken at the race's finish line shortly before two bombs exploded at mid-afternoon Monday.FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers has appealed to the public for information."The person who did this is someone's friend, neighbor or relative," DesLauriers said at a televised briefing."Someone knows who did this. The cooperation of the community will play a crucial role in the investigation," he said."We are asking anyone who may have heard someone speak about the marathon or the date of April 15 in any way that indicated he or she may target the event," DesLauriers said.Investigators also are studying pieces that appear to have come from the explosive devices, fashioned from pressure cookers packed with ball bearings and nails.CBS reported al-Qaida's online forums and chat rooms were rife with speculation on who was responsible. The terror network has been encouraging so-called lone wolf actions -- attacks by jihadists acting on their own to reduce the likelihood their plans would be discovered."The investigators are struggling with that question as al-Qaida, on the other side of the world, is wondering 'Was that us?'" said John Miller, a former assistant FBI director and a senior CBS correspondent.Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director told CNN, based on what is known so far about the attack, it "has the hallmarks of both domestic and international" attacks."If your experience and your expertise is Middle East terrorism, it has the hallmarks of al-Qaida or a Middle East group," he said. "If your experience is domestic groups and bombings that have occurred here, it has the hallmarks of a domestic terrorist like Eric Rudolph in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics bombings."U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who formerly represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate, said Wednesday Boston "is not going to be intimidated" by the attack."But we are going to find out who did this," he said during testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill, Wednesday. "The police work being done is extraordinary. The FBI is remarkable. There is a great deal of forensic evidence. We are hopeful we can bring people to justice."No one has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts, although the Pakistani Taliban denied any connection.Among the injured, more than 20 were in critical condition, hospitals said. Thirteen people had to have limbs amputated.Officials said they have received more than 2,000 tips from the public.

| License Photo	Feb. 27 (UPI) -- Australian DJs Kyle Sandilands and Jackie Henderson broke the exclusive news--so far unconfirmed by official sources--that the Spice Girls would be reunited for an Australian tour in 2014."All the Spice Girls will be touring Australia," Henderson said on the 2DayFM breakfast show Kyle & Jackie O. "No official announcement has been made, but I have a source, a very reliable source."Her co-host then hinted that the source might be Melanie Brown--more commonly known as Mel B or Scary Spice--a good friend of Henderson's.This latest rumor comes contrary to persistent suggestions that the members of the group were more focused on newer ventures, including Brown's television appearances and Victoria Beckham's fashion line.All five Spice Girls reunited in 2012 to perform at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, their first since 2008.
