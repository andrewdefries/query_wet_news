ROCHESTER, N.Y., June 17 (UPI) -- Americans' attitudes about work are shifting, with the changes both positive and negative, the Harris Poll Jobs and Benefits Security Index indicated.The survey of 1,192 U.S. workers conducted in May 20-22 found that more workers are confident about the expectation of a raise or improved benefits.But more, compared to a poll taken in April, indicated they were fearful that a lower paid employee or improved technology could erode their job security.In addition, a growing number of workers indicated they feared having to do more work for the same pay, the survey found.By the numbers, 20 percent -- up from 16 percent in April -- indicated they believed they would receive better healthcare benefits within three months. Concerning retirement benefits, 19 percent -- up from 13 percent in April -- indicated they would receive better retirement benefits in the same period.How about a raise?Thirty-two percent -- compared to 29 percent in April -- indicated they believed they would receive a raise within three months.But all those gains were offset by fears of redundancies in the workplace that would erode hours of work or entire jobs.The survey found 18 percent of U.S. workers -- up from 15 percent in April -- indicated they believed they will be replaced by a lower-cost employee. In May's survey, 56 percent -- up from 53 percent in April -- indicated they believed they would be asked within three months to do more work without extra pay.As a result of the conflicting sentiments about aspects of job security, Harris said the aggregate total that makes up the firm's Jobs and Benefits Security Index broke even at 57 percent from April to May.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, April 10 (UPI) -- British actress Natalie Dormer is to begin a three-episode arc playing Sherlock Holmes' former lover, Irene Adler, on "Elementary," CBS announced. Dormer's television credits include "Game of Thrones" and "The Tudors." "We're moving to the next chapter in our show -- and in some ways, to a previous chapter in Holmes' story," executive producer Rob Doherty said in a statement Tuesday. "Irene Adler is perhaps the most pivotal relationship in Sherlock's life, and I can't think of an actress better suited to the challenge than Natalie."Dormer's arc is to begin May 9 and will end with the show's 2-hour Season 1 finale.Based on the 19th century stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "Elementary" is a modern-day drama about private detective and recovering drug addict Sherlock Holmes and former surgeon Joan Watson, a crime-solving duo called upon to help crack the New York Police Department's toughest cases.

July 22 (UPI) -- A crew of movie stuntmen from a company called Stunts 911 became real life heroes on the first day of Comic-Con in San Diego.The crew was setting up a promotion for "Kick-Ass 2" when they heard a commotion, and saw that a woman had climbed over her 14th-floor balcony rail in the apartment building across the street.Gregg Sergeant and his crew ran to the building, and quickly scaled a fence as bystanders shouted "Don't do it!" and "Don't jump!" while waiting for authorities.The stuntmen located a security guard who let them into the apartment. The woman, facing outward from her balcony, did not hear the men approach."She was hanging on with one hand, and had one foot off the ledge," stuntman Amos Carver told KERO. "She was ready to go," Sergeant said.Sergeant quickly wrapped her in a bear hug while Carver and Scott Schecter rushed from behind. Carver was already wearing scaffolding rigging, which aided the rescue. "It was just real easy to grab something off and throw it around her and yank her entirely back in," Carver said."I hooked my arms underneath her leg and we pulled her back in and carried her into the room and laid her on the couch," said Schecter."If we're saving somebody, it's a situation we constructed in such a way that they're out on the edge of life or death intentionally to get a certain shot [IN A FILM], and we swoop in. But those are people that are expecting this."Police arrived just after the rescue, and said the woman was distraught over a recent breakup, and had been drinking."I was just so thankful we got there when we got there. I think if we'd been there two seconds later, she would've been gone," Sergeant said.

HOUSTON, June 28 (UPI) -- Researchers at Rice University in Houston say they've developed a lithium-ion rechargeable battery that can be painted onto virtually any surface.The rechargeable battery consists of spray-painted layers each doing the job of a different component in a traditional battery, Rice material scientist Pulickel Ajayan said."This means traditional packaging for batteries has given way to a much more flexible approach that allows all kinds of new design and integration possibilities for storage devices," he said in a Rice release Thursday."There has been a lot of interest in recent times in creating power sources with an improved form factor, and this is a big step forward in that direction."The researchers formulated and tested paints for each of the five layered components -- two current collectors, a cathode, an anode and a polymer separator in the middle.The hand-painted batteries were remarkably consistent in their capacities and were put through 60 charge-discharge cycles with only a very small drop in capacity, Rice researcher Neelam Singh said.The batteries were easily charged with a small solar cell, she said, and combining them with recently developed paintable solar cells would create an excellent energy-harvesting combination."Spray painting is already an industrial process, so it would be very easy to incorporate this into industry," Singh said.

WASHINGTON, May 10 (UPI) -- The U.S. government isn't looking to set up permanent military bases in Afghanistan and ongoing presence would be on an invitation-only basis, officials said.Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he wanted security and reconstruction assurances from the United States in an eventual bilateral security agreement. He added that the U.S. government was looking to establish nine military bases in the country.Both sides are engaged in deliberations that would define the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan after international forces leave the country next year.White House spokesman Jay Carney said the U.S. military would stay on in Afghanistan only at the request of Karzai's administration. An ongoing presence would be aimed at military training and the targeting of al-Qaida.U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the terms of the bilateral security agreement were up for debate."The United States does not seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan," he said. "We envision that the bilateral security agreement will address access to and use of Afghan facilities by U.S. forces."U.S. and international forces entered Afghanistan in 2001 to take on al-Qaida and their Taliban hosts.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., March 17 (UPI) -- Six alleged rapes in Florida have occurred during the first week of spring break, Daytona Beach police said. One rape allegedly occurred in a men's washroom at Ocean Center on Sunday, during which the victim could not get a good look at her attacker because he held her hair while he raped her, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. No one has been arrested in that incident. Reported rapes usually are on the rise in March because of spring break, the News-Journal said."All of last year we had a total of 41 sexual assaults. Here we have six in one week," said police chief Mike Chitwood. In another incident, 26-year-old Donco Mitrov of Daytona Beach is accused of raping a woman who was drunk when he met her. He allegedly plied her with more alcohol and raped her twice in the hallways at a beachfront hotel, police said. Mitrov was charged with sexual battery and released from jail on $20,000 bond, police said. The other four rapes happened behind a beachfront restaurant, at another hotel, and one after a woman met a man at a nightclub and invited him to go with her, the police chief said.

WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 8 (UPI) -- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it has broken up a $100 million international software piracy ring and its Chinese leader has pleaded guilty.Xiang Li of Chengdu, China, pleaded guilty in federal court in Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Charles M. Oberly III said. Customs officials said it was one of the largest copyright infringement rings ever uncovered.Prosecutors said the 36-year-old ran the website www.Crack99.com, which offered thousands of pirated software titles for a fraction of their retail cost. When software is "cracked" its internal licensing code is compromised, allowing it to be duplicated and copied, then resold for pennies on the dollar.More than one-third of his customers were from the United States, with several high-level defense contractors named by prosecutors as having purchased cracked software to avoid the full expense.He faces a maximum 25-year prison term, a fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release when sentenced by U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark May 3.

| License Photo	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 30 (UPI) -- Osama bin Laden used five houses and fathered four children while in hiding after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. soil, a wife told Pakistani investigators.The testimony of Amal Ahmad Abdul Fateh, bin Laden's youngest wife, provided an account of life on the lam for the al-Qaida founder and his family in the years between the 2001 attacks and the U.S. raid in May that killed bin Laden at his home in Abbottabad, Pakistan, at age 54, The New York Times reported. The Times said the Jan. 19 police report paraphrased her recounting and lacked detail about Pakistanis who aided her husband in eluding pursuers. It was first mentioned in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn Thursday and the Times later obtained a copy.Authorities are interested in bin Laden's three widows, under house arrest in Islamabad, because they might be able to answer some questions that have frustrated Western intelligence agencies since the 2001 attacks. Investigators say the older wives, identified as Kharia Hussain Sabir and Siham Sharif, have been uncooperative but Fateh, who was wounded in the May raid, has spoken to officials.The women's lawyer said he expects the wives and two adult children to be indicted Monday on charges of breaking Pakistani immigration laws. In Washington, U.S. officials told the Times they couldn't confirm all information in the report, but it seemed to be consistent with what is known and believed about bin Laden's movements. Among other things Fateh told investigators was bin Laden took his family deep into rural mountain areas of northwest Pakistan, but not the tribal region focused on by the West, the Times said. She said they moved among several safe houses and that two of his children were born in public hospitals while the family was in hiding.

Jan. 11 (UPI) -- The White House issued a semi-serious response to the recent "We the People" petition demanding the construction of a Death Star for defense purposes.Unfortunately, it was "not the the petition response you're looking for."Citing the exorbitant cost ($850 quadrillion, or 850 followed by 15 zeroes), of building a such a weapon, but also that "the Administration does not support blowing up planets," the White House rejected a petition to begin the construction of a Death Star.The petition, started Nov. 14 on the White House's "We the People" site, suggested that a real-life version of the moon-like superweapon from Star Wars would spur job creation and solve all national defense problems by sheer intimidation.Paul Shawcross, the White House budget guy in charge of science and space who wrote the petition's response, also pointed out it would be an awful waste of taxpayer dollars to build something with "a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship."Shawcross then touts the space projects the U.S. is already supporting, including the International Space Station, the construction of a successor to the Hubble Space telescope, and the expansion of of private industry in space.It's not a Death Star, that's true. But the past few years have been pretty good for us when it comes to space.That, and President Obama does know his way around a light saber.
(Official White House photo)The full White House response:
OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE TO "Secure resources and funding, and begin construction of a Death Star by 2016."
This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking ForBy Paul ShawcrossThe Administration shares your desire for job creation and a strong national defense, but a Death Star isn't on the horizon. Here are a few reasons:The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it.
The Administration does not support blowing up planets.
Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?However, look carefully (here's how) and you'll notice something already floating in the sky -- that's no Moon, it's a Space Station! Yes, we already have a giant, football field-sized International Space Station in orbit around the Earth that's helping us learn how humans can live and thrive in space for long durations. The Space Station has six astronauts -- American, Russian, and Canadian -- living in it right now, conducting research, learning how to live and work in space over long periods of time, routinely welcoming visiting spacecraft and repairing onboard garbage mashers, etc. We've also got two robot science labs -- one wielding a laser -- roving around Mars, looking at whether life ever existed on the Red Planet.Keep in mind, space is no longer just government-only. Private American companies, through NASA's Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office (C3PO), are ferrying cargo -- and soon, crew -- to space for NASA, and are pursuing human missions to the Moon this decade.Even though the United States doesn't have anything that can do the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, we've got two spacecraft leaving the Solar System and we're building a probe that will fly to the exterior layers of the Sun. We are discovering hundreds of new planets in other star systems and building a much more powerful successor to the Hubble Space Telescope that will see back to the early days of the universe.We don't have a Death Star, but we do have floating robot assistants on the Space Station, a President who knows his way around a light saber and advanced (marshmallow) cannon, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is supporting research on building Luke's arm, floating droids, and quadruped walkers.We are living in the future! Enjoy it. Or better yet, help build it by pursuing a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field. The President has held the first-ever White House science fairs and Astronomy Night on the South Lawn because he knows these domains are critical to our country's future, and to ensuring the United States continues leading the world in doing big things.If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field, the Force will be with us! Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
