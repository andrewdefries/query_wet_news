| License Photo	Unleash the lawyers. A class-action lawsuit was filed within 48 hours after South Korean automakers Hyundai Motor America and Kia Motors Corp. apologized for overstating the fuel economy of their vehicles.Hyundai and Kia have admitted the estimated mileage of more than 900,000 cars, trucks and sport-utes sold in the United States and 120,000 sold in Canada since 2010 was exaggerated and said it would compensate current and former owners with debit cards for the additional amount they spent on gasoline.The automakers apologized in full-page ads in The Washington Post."We sincerely apologize for these errors, and our top priority is to make things right for you," their statement said.That's easier said than done, but that's what the Korean automakers say they will do."We think our reimbursement program provides the best, quickest, and most customer-focused remedy," Hyundai Motor America spokesman Chris Hosford told The Detroit News. "We are fully compensating affected Hyundai owners for the additional lifetime fuel costs associated with our rating adjustment -- plus a 15 percent premium." Hyundai said owners of affected vehicles "have responded very favorably to the plan," which would give an average Florida motorist who drove 15,000 miles a year about $88.However, the mea culpa and offer of compensation did not stop a Cincinnati law firm from filing a 14-page suit in U.S. District Court seeking more than $5 million in damages.The News said the reimbursement program could cost Hyundai and Kia more than $100 million in addition to any civil penalties exacted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Hyundai and Kia revised its corporate average fuel economy for its entire fleet of 2012 vehicles downward 1 mpg to 26 mph -- but the adjustment for some specific vehicles was as much as 6 mpg. The Kia Soul compact crossover, popularized by those commercials featuring hip-hop hamsters, saw its mileage reduced as much as 4 mpg, depending on the model.The automakers also retracted claims that three of its 2013 models, including the hot-selling Hyundai Elantra, get 40 mpg. Hyundai sold more than 1 million Elantras through October.Consumer Watchdog, a consumer group, filed a lawsuit in California in July, claiming Hyundai misstated and inflated gas mileage for 2011 and 2012 Elantras. The car's revised fuel economy rating is 2 mpg less, 38 mpg in highway driving.Industry experts say the mileage flap likely will reduce the resale value of Hyundai and Kia vehicles in the near term.Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court said consumers may end up with "residual values that are less than they paid for a product that doesn't deliver what they want," USA Today reported. "They advertised 40 mpg even when they knew no one would get 40 mpg."Investors sent Hyundai Motor shares down more than 7 percent Monday.Hyundai and Kia blame the overstated mileage claims on "differences in interpreting" results of fuel efficiency testing in the United States and South Korea, The Chosum Ilbo, an English-language Korean newspaper, said.The companies said the inflated mileage claims were caused by "procedural errors" and said they had "corrected the test process."Sung Hwan Cho, head of Hyundai-Kia technical centers in the United States, told the Detroit Free Press the misstatement was more a result of the complexities of the testing process rather than results in the information on a new vehicle window sticker at the dealer.One key component called "road load" measures the resistance of a vehicle's tires on the pavement, the vehicle's wind resistance and how the parts of the drivetrain, engine, transaxle or transmission, work together."There are hundreds of different parameters that can affect this road load," he said. "Ambient temperature, wind speeds, atmospheric pressure."Cho said Hyundai engineers had added steps to the testing process in 2010 different from the recommended EPA process in to improve the efficiency of the test.The EPA does not test the fuel economy of every vehicle sold. The National Vehicle and Fuel Emission Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., routinely tests 150 to 200 vehicles a year to make sure the mileage and emissions match the data submitted by auto companies to the EPA.Suzuki ending U.S. sales of cars and trucksAfter 27 years in the U.S. market, American Suzuki Motor Corp., the U.S. unit of the Japanese automaker, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and said it would stop selling new cars and trucks in the United States.Suzuki will continue to sell motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and marine equipment in the U.S. market."The realignment is intended to better position ASMC for long-term success and is a return to the company's roots in the U.S. market, which began with motorcycles," Suzuki said in a statement.The struggling small car specialist entered the U.S. market in 1985 and sold 102,000 vehicles just five years ago on the strength of such popular vehicles as the Grand Vitara SUV.The bestselling Suzuki model in the U.S. this year was the crossover SX4. Although its mid-size Kizashi sedan received favorable reviews, sales were hit hard by the financial crisis and rising gasoline prices. Suzuki also was at a disadvantage because it imported all of its vehicles from Japan while other Japanese automakers like Toyota and Nissan have U.S. factories.Sales declined to slightly more than 21,000 new cars in the first 10 months of this year, about 1,000 less than in same period of 2011. Although sales were up 5 percent last month from October a year ago, that's a far cry of Suzuki's ambition to sell 200,000 vehicles in the United States annually.Analysts said by focusing on smaller vehicles Suzuki had surrendered a large segment of the U.S. market, but that it may sell more smaller, low-cost vehicles in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China, where automakers Nissan and Volkswagen are considering selling cheaper sub-brands.American Suzuki Motor Corp. said it will honor warranties on its vehicles and offer parts and service through its dealer networkNew car vehicle mileage best everThe University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute says fuel economy of new vehicles sold in the United States in October averaged 24.1 mpg, the best in the history of the survey.Mileage based on the EPA estimates on the window stickers was 4 mpg higher than estimated fuel economy in October 2007 reflecting a 20 percent improvement, and that includes corrected mileage for Hyundai and Kia vehicles.The university's Eco-Driving Index, which estimates average monthly emissions of greenhouse gases generated by all U.S. vehicles, has improved 19 percent since 2007, the first year of the index. The Eco-Driving Index was for August.Regular unleaded gasoline averaged $3.46 a gallon nationwide this week, 5 cents higher than a year ago.The average fuel economy was calculated from monthly sales of new light-duty vehicles -- cars, trucks, SUVs, vans and pickups -- and the combined city-highway fuel-economy ratings in the EPA Fuel Economy Guide for the respective models, the Institute said in a release.

EMINEM HOLDS ON TO BILLBOARD TOP SPOTEminem maintained a stranglehold on the No. 1 position in Billboard's Top 200, holding off new entry Papa Roach and Korn."The Eminem Show" was rated the top selling album of the week for the fifth week in a row. Papa Roach debuted at No. 2 with "Lovehatetragedy," knocking Korn's "Untouchables" down to the three spot.Wycvlef Jean debuted at No. 6 with "Masquerade" and Our Lady Peace debuted in ninth place with "Gravity.""The Osbourne Family Album" plunged from 13 to 35 in the listings in its second week on the chart.BRITNEY TAKES BITE OF THE APPLEBritney Spears invited New Yorkers into her new restaurant, NYLA, Thursday at an official opening night party.The bistro at the Dylan Hotel on Manhattan's tony east side aims to capitalize on the teen pop queen's celebrity, but relies on the culinary reputation of Spears' home state, Louisiana.Chef Michael Perselay is featuring southern staples like fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, crabcakes and duck and wild mushroom etouffee.The restaurant's title draws attention to the connection between New York and Louisiana and is co-owned by Morris Moinian, who is not concerned about Spears' appeal to potential patrons of legal drinking age."It's a lounge, an alcohol environment, and our target is young executives from 25 to 40 years old," Moinian told the New York Times.JOEL DID IT FOR ALEXABilly Joel told People magazine his 10-day rehab stint at a Connecticut hospital was a Father's Day gift to his 16-year-old daughter Alexa."I told my daughter that I recognized having a problem," said Joel. "And my gift to her for Father's Day was going to be cleaning up my act."Joel said he was depressed because medical problems forced him to cancel a tour with Elton John in March."I've been touring for 30 years and only had to cancel a handful of shows in my life, so I took this really hard," Joel said. "I then began what I ultimately realized was a prolonged period of overindulgence."R. KELLY PLEADS INNOCENTR. Kelly still believes he can fly -- away from charges he videotaped himself having sex with a 13-year-old girl. Kelly pleaded innocent to 21 child pornography charges Wednesday in Cook County Court in Chicago."I can't talk right now," Kelly, 35, said after the court appearance, but lawyer Sam Adam maintained his client's innocence. "I haven't seen the tape," Adam said, "but I know the FBI has been wrong 100 times in the last year."Kelly currently is free on bail pending his next court date on Aug. 7.RAPPER KHUJO LOSES LEGGoodie Mob rapper Khujo lost his leg as a result of injuries suffered in a car accident early Tuesday in Atlanta.Khujo lost his right leg below the kneecap from an accident after he left a recording session.

CHATHAM ISLANDS, New Zealand, Dec. 28 (UPI) -- A 100-million-year-old fossil forest on an island east of New Zealand has provided clues about ancient life close to the South Pole, researchers say.Researchers from Monash University in Australia reported the discovery of large trees, early flowering plants, seed cones and rare insects preserved in a rock formation in the Chatham Islands.The fossils are the first evidence of life close to the South Pole during the Cretaceous period, 145 million to 65 million years ago, a time researchers say was a period of extreme greenhouse conditions on Earth."One hundred million years ago, the Earth was in the grip of a greenhouse effect -- a planet of extreme heat with minimal ice (except in the high altitudes) and sea levels of up to 200 meters (650 feet) higher than today," Monash paleontologists Professor Stillwell said.In the Cretaceous period many southern continents including New Zealand, Australia, Antarctica and South America were still mostly joined together as part of the ancient southern landmass of Gondwana."Rainforests inhabited by dinosaurs existed in sub-polar latitudes and polar ecosystems were adapted to long months of winter darkness and summer daylight," Stillwell said.The discovery was made in one of the most remote fossil locations in the Southern Hemisphere, more than 500 miles east of New Zealand."Never before have we had evidence about what life existed near the South Pole 90 to 100 million years, or the conditions that life on land experienced," Stillwell said.

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 2 (UPI) -- A well-known swimming coach in Charlotte, N.C., has been charged in Alabama with sexual conduct involving a juvenile, police said. Capt. Van Jackson of the Lee County Sheriff's Office said Jamie Thomas, 54, was arrested there Sept. 18, The Charlotte Observer reported Tuesday. He was released after posting $500 bail, and police in Alabama have refused to give details about the case because the victim is underage. Thomas has owned New South Swimming since 1997, serving as the club's head coach. The club, which now has about 125 members, has produced nationally ranked swimmers. In July, Thomas took a leave as head coach."It's personal at this point and I am just taking some time off and dealing with all of my issues and my family," he told the Observer at the time. Thomas was North Carolina Swimming's Senior Coach of the Year in 2010.A spokeswoman for USA Swimming said Thomas has agreed to a suspension pending a full hearing on the charges against him.

June 18 (UPI) -- A Texas teen managed to free himself after he was attacked by a shark in waist-deep water off Surfside Beach, southwest of Galveston.Garrett Sebesta, 15, was flown by helicopter to a Houston hospital for surgery after he was pulled from the water Monday afternoon.Garrett's mother said her son was wading off the beach when he felt something bite his leg. He reached into the water to pull the shark off, and was bitten on the left hand.Garrett has severe nerve damage in his hand and a chunk of his calf missing, but is expected to recover."He's gonna be good," said Z.W. Monnat, a paramedic who was one of the first on the scene. "Strong kid.""Kudos to the victim, 'cause he felt the shark bite, and then he literally tore the shark off him," Monnat said.A witness said Garrett was awake and talking when he was loaded onto a stretcher and then onto the Life Flight helicopter. Paramedics said he was airlifted so as to give him the best chance of retaining full use of his injured hand.It was not immediately clear what kind of shark attacked him.

June 16 (UPI) -- Pope Francis was greeted by hundreds of motorcyclists on Sunday, as Harley enthusiasts joined Catholics in St. Peter's Square for the new pontiff's pro-life mass and the 110th anniversary of Harley-Davidson, BBC News reported. The pope addressed the crowd, many of whom were wearing leather, following mass. He said prayers for "every human life, especially the most fragile, defenceless and threatened.""Just because we're motorcyclists doesn't mean we're not Catholics," Italian biker Emmanuele Jaconi told the Guardian. "It's just a hobby. We like to drive our bikes around, and if the pope thinks it's good then all the better," a German biker said.

Wiki
César David Izturis ( /ɪsˈtʊərɪs/; born February 10, 1980, in Barquisimeto, Venezuela) is a Major League Baseball shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles. He is the half-brother of shortstop Maicer Izturis, who plays for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Julio Izturis, who plays in the minor leagues in the San Francisco Giants organization.
Izturis' greatest strengths are spectacular defense and solid contact hitting. He is a switch hitter with good speed, but very little power.
Signed by the Toronto Blue Jays as an amateur free agent in 1996, Izturis made his debut with Toronto in 2001 and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the end of the season.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Wiki
Robert Walden (born Robert Wolkowitz; September 25, 1943) is an American television and motion picture actor. He is best known for his role as Joe Rossi on Lou Grant for which he was nominated for an Emmy three times and his role as Joe Waters on Brothers. He's currently a series regular on Happily Divorced.
Walden was born in New York, New York, the son of Hilda (née Winokur) and Max Wolkowitz.
Walden's career began in 1970, in Bloody Mama for Roger Corman. After that, and for the first several years of his career, he often played young doctors, such as in the television series "The Bold Ones" as Dr. Cohen (after the departure of John Saxon prior to the final season), and notably in films Blue Sunshine and Paddy Chayefsky's The Hospital. His breakthrough role was in the television series Lou Grant, on which he played journalist Joe Rossi. He was a cast member on Lou Grant during its entire run (1977–1982), and received three Emmy Award nominations (in 1979, 1980 and 1981) for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on that series. Walden has played several historical characters, including Donald Segretti in the 1976 film All the President's Men, and J. Robert Oppenheimer in the 1980 TV movie Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb. From 1984 - 1989 he starred in the groundbreaking Showtime sitcom Brothers as the middle of three brothers, the owner of a bar/restaurant who was a retired NFL placekicker. His youngest brother, played by Paul Regina, was gay and the series dealt with issues regarding homosexuality. Walden also made a cameo appearance as a sound engineer in the 1994 film Radioland Murders.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
