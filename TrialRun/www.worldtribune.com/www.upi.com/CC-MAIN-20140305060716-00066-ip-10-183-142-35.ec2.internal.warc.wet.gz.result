SEATTLE, Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Starbucks agreed to pay $2.76 billion to a Kraft Foods spinoff for ending a deal for Kraft to get the U.S. coffee giant's packaged brews to grocery chains.Starbucks Corp. agreed after being ordered by an arbitrator to make the payment, ending a three-year fight that started when Starbucks fired Kraft Foods Inc. as its packaged ground and whole beans distributor after complaining Kraft didn't do enough to stock and promote the coffees, which Starbucks said was hurting the Seattle coffee company and coffeehouse chain's corporate performance.Starbucks, which started the six-year deal with Kraft in 2008, sought to end the deal in 2010, offering to pay Kraft $750 million.Kraft rejected the offer, but Starbucks withdrew anyway in 2011, prompting Kraft to begin breach-of-contract arbitration proceedings to get Starbucks to pay what Kraft claimed the agreement stipulated.Starbucks said Kraft didn't live up to its end of the deal.Kraft lawyers argued Starbucks owed $2.9 billion, plus attorney fees, based on nearly $500 million in sales of the Starbucks coffee it distributed in 2010.Analysts cited by The Wall Street Journal estimated Starbucks would probably be told by the arbitrator to pay more than $1 billion.Kraft split into two companies in October 2012, with Kraft Foods becoming Mondelez International Inc. Mondelez of Deerfield, Ill., which now focuses on snacks and confections, is to get the payments from Starbucks as part of the spinoff agreement with Kraft.Mondelez said it planned to use the money to buy back shares of stock.Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said his company strongly disagreed with the arbitrator's conclusion."We believe Kraft did not deliver on its responsibilities to our brand under the agreement; the performance of the business suffered as a result," he said in a statement.At the same time, he said Starbucks was "pleased the arbitration has ended."The New York Times said Starbucks would not appeal the decision and simply pay the money.Starbucks said it had enough cash and borrowing capacity to make the payment, which will be booked as a charge to its fiscal 2013 operating expenses."We're glad to put this issue behind us," Mondelez General Counsel Gerd Pleuhs said in a statement."We can now fully focus on growing our global snacks business," he said, adding, "We're pleased that the arbitrator validated our position that Starbucks breached our successful and longstanding contractual relationship without proper compensation."Kraft now has a new partner in the packaged-coffee business -- McDonald's Corp., the Journal noted. The company said last month it would sell packaged McCafe coffee in U.S. grocery stores in test markets next year.

| License Photo	CORNUCOPIA, Wis., Oct. 13 (UPI) -- No government agency, certification group or other entity defines the term "natural" on food labels, a U.S. watchdog group says.The report by the Cornucopia Institute, an organic industry watchdog, said there is a growing trend of marketing conventional foods as natural to lure health-conscious and eco-conscious consumers.Breakfast cereals displaying the USDA's "certified organic" logo are produced under a strict set of verified standards prohibiting the use of petrochemical-based fertilizers, sewage sludge, synthetic toxic pesticides, genetically modified crops and many other common conventional agricultural and manufacturing inputs.Charlotte Vallaeys, director of farm and food policy at Cornucopia, said some companies that started out organic and built brand loyalty as organic brands, switched to non-organic ingredients and "natural" labeling.One such brand, Peace Cereal, is an example of what Cornucopia calls "bait-and-switch." In 2008, the Peace Cereal brand switched from organic to cheaper conventional ingredients, without lowering its prices, Vallaeys said."Today, the cereal is sold in natural food stores and mainstream grocers at prices above many of their certified organic competitors that are using more expensive organic ingredients," Vallaeys said.Natural cereals from brands including Kashi (Kellogg's), Mother's (PepsiCo), Nutritious Living, Barbara's Bakery (Weetabix) and 365 (Whole Foods Market) contained high levels of genetically engineered ingredients -- between 25 percent to 100 percent, the report said.The report is accompanied by a scorecard rating cereal and granola brands for healthy and environmentally sustainable practices at www.cornucopia.org.

MONTPELIER, Vt., April 13 (UPI) -- Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin said Friday he was bare when he scared off four bears raiding the bird feeders outside his Montpelier home on a recent night.Shumlin said he had retired for the evening Wednesday au natural -- "Real Vermont boys don't wear pajamas," he told WDEV Radio in Waterbury -- when he heard a noise outside. He got up and saw what appeared to be two adult bears and two cubs going after the bird feeders on a porch about 10 feet away from his bedroom window.Shumlin said he "used my strongest Vermonter" voice to shoo the bears away and then went out to bring the feeders inside, the Burlington Free Press reported.The 56-year-old governor said he started to bring two feeders inside when the bears returned. He again yelled at them and they ran to the edge of the yard.Shumlin said when he returned to get the other two feeders, the bruins appeared upset to lose their meal and the largest one game running back."He just booked it for the porch," said Shumlin, who beat a hasty retreat to the door."When I opened the door, he was on the porch and 5 feet from the door," Shumlin said. "I screamed through that door. I didn't know if the bear was coming through."Vermont Fish and Wildlife Chief Warden David LeCours said the four bears might have actually been three cubs and a sow that might have been aggressive because it perceived the governor as a threat to her cubs.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, March 21 (UPI) -- Kiradech Aphibarnrat shot a 7-under-par 65 Thursday for the first-round clubhouse lead before rains hit at the European Tour's Maybank Malaysian Open.Aphibarnrat had four birdies on each side against one bogey in earning a one-stroke lead over four other players.In that group at 6-under is Scott Jamieson, who completed 10 holes before play was suspended due to rain.About half the field of 154 players will have to complete their first rounds before the second round can begin Friday. Some players got only four holes in Thursday before play was suspended.Jamison opened with a bogey but had five birdies before making the turn and had an eagle at the par-5 10th hole before he was called off the course. Also at 6-under, but with their first rounds complete, are Gregory Bourdy, Anders Hansen and Edoardo Molinari.Aphibarnrat started play Thursday on the second nine of the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club course with a birdie but was back to even after a 12th-hole bogey. He posted back-to-back birdies at Nos. 14 and 15 before adding another at 17.He climbed into the lead with three straight birdies at holes 3-5 and closed his day with a ninth-hole birdie.

N'DJAMENA, Chad, April 14 (UPI) -- Chad has broken off diplomatic ties with neighboring Sudan a day after its troops repelled a rebel attack on the capital, N'Djamena.Sudan has denied Chad's accusations that it backs the rebels led by the United Force for Change, reports the BBC. Chad also warned that it might expel refugees who have fled the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region, the report said."We have taken the decision to break our diplomatic relations with Sudan today and to proceed to close our frontiers," Chadian President Idriss Deby told a rally in N'Djamena.A U.N. envoy from France was quoted as saying the rebels came from Darfur. France has about 1,350 troops in its former colony.The rebels want to bring down the regime of Deby, claiming the president is a dictator.

NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (UPI) -- Bedbugs have turned up in at least 16 schools in New York this school year, but school officials say it's not an epidemic.As the city at large has seen a surge in the pests, schools are reporting a rise in confirmed cases, 336 in the first two months of this school year compared with 135 in the same period in 2009, the New York Daily News reported Friday.Education Department officials insist it's not an epidemic since schools have few beds and, therefore, have not become breeding grounds. They also stressed that a confirmed case could be the discovery of a single bug."We do not have infestations," spokeswoman Margie Feinberg said. "Schools are required to report specimens."Some parents and students say they don't find that comforting."I think it's an epidemic. Bedbugs are everywhere," said Anna Shter, 37, whose son is a kindergartner at a Brooklyn school where bedbugs were found twice in the last month.Brianna Simmons, 10, a fifth-grader at the school, remembered being informed of the bedbugs by school officials."I was, like, 'OMG, there's bedbugs in the school,'" she said.Bedbugs were reported at schools in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, the Daily News reported.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- President Obama has determined there is enough oil worldwide to allow countries to rely less on oil produced in Iran, the White House said Friday."There currently appears to be sufficient supply of non-Iranian oil to permit foreign countries to significantly reduce their import of Iranian oil, taking into account current estimates of demand, increased production by countries other than Iran, inventories of crude oil and petroleum products, and available strategic petroleum reserves," a statement released by the White House said."In this context, it is notable that many purchasers of Iranian crude oil have reduced their purchases or announced they are in productive discussions with alternative suppliers," the statement said. The analysis indicates that while there have been disruptions that have interrupted oil availability and concern remains Iran's nuclear activity may have increased demand for non-Iran-produced oil, "production increases in other countries and weaker demand growth overall have mitigated oil market tightness to a degree."Obama made the determination as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 concerning the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran.

| License Photo	April 3 (UPI) -- Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks' outspoken owner, already has a reputation for unorthodox business practices. So it's not a stretch to believe he'd consider drafting a women's basketball player to the NBA. Cuban told ESPN's Tim MacMahon that he would consider Brittney Griner, the 6-foot-8 Baylor University student who has dominated women's college basketball, as a second-round draft pick for his summer league team. "I've thought about it. I've thought about it already. Would I do it? Right now, I'd lean toward yes, just to see if she can do it. You never know unless you give somebody a chance, and it's not like the likelihood of any late-50s draft pick has a good chance of making it."Griner claimed she'd be up to the challenge, posting a link to the ESPN report on Twitter: Mark Cuban may draft Brittney Griner m.espn.go.com/general/story?… ...I would hold my own!

Wiki
Gerardo Enrique Parra (born May 6, 1987 in Santa Barbara del Zulia, Venezuela) is a Major League Baseball left fielder for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
On May 13, 2009 he was called up from AA (Double A) Mobile BayBears when left fielder Conor Jackson was placed on the disabled list. He was inserted into the starting lineup the same day, and in his first Major League at bat he became the 100th player in MLB history to hit a home run in his first at bat. In his first five games he had at least one RBI, becoming the second player since Mike Lansing (1993) in the last 30 years to accomplish this feat. Parra was named NL Rookie of the Month for May and reached base in each of his first 17 games .
