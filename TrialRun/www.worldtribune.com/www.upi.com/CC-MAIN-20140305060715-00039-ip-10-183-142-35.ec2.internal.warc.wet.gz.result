BANGKOK, April 25 (UPI) -- Protesters called for a halt to construction on the proposed $3.8 billion Xayaburi dam project on the Lower Mekong River in northern Laos.Converging on the headquarters of Thai construction company Ch. Karnchang's annual shareholders meeting Tuesday in Bangkok, civil society groups and community representatives from villages along the Mekong said the company is defying a Mekong River Commission's ruling made last December.MRC -- comprised of Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia -- is the core body through which the four countries negotiate and discuss trans-boundary effects of management of their shared river. The December ruling called for the Xayaburi project to be delayed until a comprehensive environmental impact study can more properly identify potential risks.At issue with the protesters is Ch. Karnchang's announcement last week to the Thai Stock Exchange that it had signed a $711 million construction contract with the Xayaburi Power Co. for the 1,260-megawatt hydro project, which is opposed by environmentalists and villagers.The Bangkok Post reports that 3,000 residents at the construction site have already been relocated.Plew Trivisvavet, chief executive officer of Ch. Karnchang, speaking at the shareholder's meeting, said the Xayaburi dam project is vital for the future success of the company, The Nation newspaper reports. He said he expects the company will earn a return of 10 percent on its investment in the project.The longest river in Southeast Asia, the Mekong stretches 3,000 miles to the South China Sea and is home to more than 700 species of freshwater fish, including the endangered Mekong catfish. The Lower Mekong supports nearly 60 million people who depend on it for their livelihood, says the World Wildlife Fund.Laos should look beyond the short-term benefits of the dam, says International Rivers, a California-based water rights group."This project may generate some money for the government but in the long-term the government should look at possible serious impacts to the Mekong River and the whole region," Pianporn Deetes, a coordinator for the organization, told Radio Free Asia."In addition, the dam will create a conflict in the region. The government should think about the people and their children, who will have to move to new villages where not much land will be available for them to cultivate."Following Ch. Karnchang's announcement last week, Cambodia threatened to take Laos to court if it allows the company to continue with construction of the Xayaburi without regional consensus."There must be a discussion before Laos can proceed with the construction. If Laos has decided unilaterally, then according to law, we can file a complaint to an international court," said Sin Niny, permanent vice chairman of Cambodia's National Mekong Committee.

ATLANTA, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- An average of about 30 people a day in 2010 in U.S. motor vehicle crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver, federal health officials say.Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said this amounts to one death every 48 minutes and the annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totaled more than $51 billion a year.Of the 1,210 traffic deaths among children ages 0-14 years in 2010, 17 percent involved an alcohol-impaired driver, the CDC said.Though episodes of driving after drinking dropped 30 percent in the past five years, it remains a serious problem -- alcohol-impaired drivers were involved in about one-third of crash deaths in 2009, the CDC said.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 15 (UPI) -- At least two-thirds of the species that inhabit the world's oceans remain completely unknown to science, a U.N.-sponsored registry of marine animals suggests.Researchers writing in the journal Current Biology estimate the ocean may be home to as many as 1 million species in total, and about 226,000 of those species have so far been described, with another 65,000 unidentified species waiting in specimen collections around the world.A massive collaborative undertaking by hundreds of experts around the globe has resulted in the first comprehensive register of marine species of the world."For the first time, we can provide a very detailed overview of species richness, partitioned among all major marine groups. It is the state of the art of what we know -- and perhaps do not know -- about life in the ocean," Ward Appeltans of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission said.The researchers say they expect the vast majority of unknown species -- mostly smaller crustaceans, mollusks, worms and sponges -- will be found this century.The World Register of Marine Species is an open-access, online database at marinespecies.org created by 270 experts representing 146 institutions and 32 countries.It is now 95 percent complete and is continually being updated as new species are discovered, researchers said.While fewer species live in the ocean than on land, marine life represents much older evolutionary lineages that are fundamental to our understanding of life on Earth, Appeltans said.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 (UPI) -- Jose Reyes highlighted a three-run 10th inning with a two-run triple Friday that brought Miami a 9-7 victory over Washington.The Nationals overcame a four-run deficit to force extra innings, but they eventually had a five-game winning streak snapped.Washington tied it at 6-6 on a solo homer by Michael Morse, after which Miami broke it open in the 10th off Tyler Clippard (2-4).Clippard gave up one-out singles to Bryan Petersen and Justin Ruggiano. That brought up Reyes, who drove a triple to left-center. Reyes later scored on a sacrifice fly by Carlos Lee.Reyes had another RBI triple in the fourth that gave Miami a 6-2 lead.Chad Gaudin (3-1) worked the ninth for Miami to get the win. Despite giving up a run in the 10th and leaving the bases loaded, Steve Cishek picked up his 13th save.Stephen Strasburg started for the Nationals and was roughed up for five runs on six hits in three innings without figuring in the decision.

TEHRAN, March 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. government must back its rhetoric with action if it wants to open communication with Iran, a senior Iranian legislator said.The U.S. government is party to multilateral talks with Iran as a permanent U.N. Security Council member. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week "there is an opportunity to work diplomatically to reduce tensions and address the mistrust between our two countries, to the mutual benefit of both of our people."Iranian lawmaker Mohammad Ali Pourmokhtar said the United States could lift some sanctions on Iran to improve relations."The United States must end its enmity with the Islamic Republic of Iran," he was quoted by Iran's Press TV as saying. "Otherwise, its offers of direct talks would be nothing more than a deception."Iran is suspected of pursuing the technology needed to manufacture a nuclear weapon, an allegation Tehran denies. The government described February negotiations in Kazakhstan as positive, though no breakthroughs were announced.Negotiations between Iran, the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany are scheduled for April in Kazakhstan.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (UPI) -- The Obama administration is considering how much more aid they want to provide to French forces fighting Islamist militants in Mali, officials say.The decision could determine how deeply involved in the conflict the United States becomes, The New York Times reported Saturday.The United States currently is transporting 600 members of a French mechanized battalion and its equipment to Mali. American officials say they are also providing satellite images and other intelligence information.The question at hand, however, is whether to use American tanker planes to refuel French jets. Such an action would allow the jets to provide close-air support to French and Malian troops on the ground. It also would raise U.S. involvement in the conflict to a new level by directly supporting military attacks.The president and his advisers, concerned about the conflict becoming an open-ended mission for the French, are mulling the broader political and strategic implications of any deeper involvements, aides say.Complicating the problem are the transitions in major security posts. Sen. John Kerry and Chuck Hagel are still awaiting confirmation to head the departments of State and Defense, respectively. Both men are known for their views on keeping American hands off conflicts that military partners can handle, or where American interests are only remotely affected.Intelligence reports said the extremists in Mali are no direct threat to the United States, but they can threaten the region. "And that's where the argument for American involvement comes in," said one official.

MADRID, March 29 (UPI) -- Spanish trade unions were off the job Thursday to protest an overhaul of union rules. Police said about 58 people have been arrested and nine were slightly injured during face-offs on picket lines, but Interior Ministry officials said the work stoppage hasn't caused any major disruptions, The New York Times reported.The strike called by Spain's two main trade unions protested an overhaul of labor rules that makes it less expensive for employers to hire and fire employees.The walkout was called in advance of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's presenting Spain's 2012 budget, which is expected to include about $26 billion in spending cuts and tax increases to help the country reach its deficit targets as agreed with the European Commission. Spain has about 23 percent of its workforce, or 5.3 million people, out of work. Red Electrica, which operates the national electricity grid, said consumption was down 25 percent at 9 a.m., local time, Thursday, the Times reported. Most banks and retailers were open for business. Although some flights were canceled, Madrid's airport was operating Thursday. In Madrid, downtown streets had more traffic than usual because people used their cars to go to work and transit trains were operating on a reduced schedule, The Wall Street Journal reported. A transportation association said protesters blocked highways in Catalonia and Valencia, and shut down industrial parks in Zaragoza, the Journal said. Francisco Perez, a one-time union representative, told the Times the strike was a "useless response to the problems that Spain is facing." "What is the point of a strike before even knowing what kind of budget this new government has put together and when unions have presented no alternative proposal to create jobs?" Perez asked.

| License Photo	Jan. 17 (UPI) -- Have you ever felt like your girlfriend wasn't really there? In Notre Dame's Manti Te'o's case, she actually wasn't. Following the incredible Deadspin story that exposed Te'o's girlfriend as an elaborate hoax, social media users have begun sharing photos of themselves posing with invisible girlfriends -- similar to the Eastwooding trend that popped when actor Clint Eastwood conversed with an invisible Barack Obama at the RNC. 'Teoing,' as it's been dubbed, is also the subject of a new Tumblr, which curates photos of people hanging out with fake girlfriends, along with meme-y photos and references to Te'o's embarrassment.(Teoing.tumblr.com)

Wiki
Butch Miller (born October 21, 1944 in Auckland, New Zealand) is a retired professional wrestler best known as one half of the tag team known as "The Sheepherders" on the independent scene and in the National Wrestling Alliance and as one half of The Bushwhackers in the WWF.
Butch Miller started wrestling for NWA New Zealand (later known as All-Star Pro Wrestling) in 1964 where he achieved a great deal of regional success. Miller, along with his friend Luke Williams, was brought to America in 1965 by fellow New Zealander Steve Rickard, who was also the booker for NWA Hawaii. Luke and Butch initially worked in Canada among others for Stu Hart’s Stampede Wrestling billed as "The Kiwis" (Butch was known as "Nick Carter" and Luke was known as "Sweet William"). The first recorded title that the Kiwis won was in 1974 when the duo beat Bob Pringle and Bill Cody for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship on January 6, 1974. The Kiwis lost the titles to Tokyo Joe and the Great Saki only to regain them a short time later. The Kiwis lost the titles for good when Stan Kowalski and Duke Savage defeated them and kept the titles away from them in subsequent rematches.
After leaving Stampede Wrestling, the Kiwis began doing double duty in NWA Pacific Northwest as well as the Canadian based International All-Star Wrestling around 1979-1980 as "the Kiwi Sheepherders". In 1979, the team won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on three occasions between July 21 and August 5, 1980 before the left the territory. On September 22, the Sheepherders lost the gold to Dutch Savage and Stan Stasiak only to regain them a week later. On February 11, 1980, the Sheepherders became double champions when they downed Dutch Savage and Stasiak once again, this time for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship. Top faces Rick Martel and "Rowdy" Roddy Piper teamed up in May 1980 to take the NWA Canadian tag title from the Sheepherders and, in effect, run the duo out of the Northwest region by August, gaining the NWA Pacific Northwest tag titles when the Sheepherders left the promotion.
