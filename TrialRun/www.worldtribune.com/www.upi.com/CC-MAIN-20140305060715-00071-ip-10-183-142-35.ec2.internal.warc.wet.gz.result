| License Photo	NEW YORK, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- British actor Eddie Redmayne says he and his co-stars of "Les Miserables" had a secret weapon for when the heartbreaking movie musical became too emotionally grueling to bear and they sought a little comedy relief."Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter," Redmayne told UPI at a press conference in New York Friday when questioned about the emotional toll the material had on the cast members and what they needed to recover after the cameras stopped rolling for the day.The famously quirky and funny twosome, who previously worked together on the movie musical, "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," play memorable supporting roles in "Les Miserables.""It was such a wonderful thing. It was such a rigorous shooting process and fueled by passion, but, my God, there were hard days," Redmayne said of making "Les Miserables." "And the way [director] Tom [Hooper] likes to work is to create real scenarios, so Sam [Barks] was singing in the freezing rain and Hugh [Jackman] was carrying me through disgusting sewer stuff -- not chocolate milkshake -- but there was this wonderful thing where Helena and Sacha arrived and brought lightness that, my God, we needed." The movie is an adaptation of Cameron Mackintosh's stage musical, which was based on Victor Hugo's classic novel, "Les Miserables." It stars Redmayne as Marius, Jackman as Jean Valjean, Barks as Eponine, Cohen and Carter as the Thenadiers, Russell Crowe as Javert, Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette.Set in 19th century France, the story of poverty, forgiveness and redemption follows Jean Valjean after he is freed from 19 years of slavery for having stolen a loaf of bread to feed a starving child. He breaks his parole by not checking in with authorities, prompting Javert to hunt him down for the rest of his life. Now free and with the help of a merciful priest, Jean Valjean reinvents himself as an honest, successful businessman who helps others whenever he can, even when doing so puts him at risk for being caught and sent back to prison. Fantine works in his factory until she has an altercation with some of the other women there and gets fired for being a troublemaker. Jean Valjean is too distracted by the arrival of Javert to aid her at the time and she is forced to sell her hair and teeth and become a prostitute to pay the Thenadiers to continue caring for her young daughter Cosette, alongside their own daughter Eponine, at their inn. Moved by the dying Fantine's story, Jean Valjean vows to raise Cosette as his own, which he does, all the while dodging Javert. Cosette grows up, adored by Jean Valjean but isolated until she meets by chance and falls in love with revolutionary Marius, who has also stolen Eponine's heart. Asked how he coached such extraordinary vocal performances from actors not well-known as singers, Hooper told UPI at another press conference: "I did a very careful auditioning process. "Everyone had to go through auditions and they were quite extensive -- at least three hours. We did have some actors, like Russell Crowe, who you usually have to offer a role to, you don't get to audition, but it was because I was determined to do it live and needed them to prove they could handle that and, also, I wasn't just looking for great singing and great acting. I was looking for people who could act through the medium of song. And instinctively know the necessary shift from singing in a big room -- much bigger than this -- compared to singing to a camera in close up. There is a necessary minimalism in film acting, which they needed to combine with the requirements of serving the song musically. That's what I was really looking for and all of those actors proved in the audition that they could do that. That was not something I could responsibly take a risk on," said Hooper, who won a Best Director Oscar in 2010 for helming Best Picture winner "The King's Speech." Mackintosh, the force behind the stage version of "Les Miserables," and Eric Fellner, co-chair of Working Title Films, acknowledged how difficult it is to translate a successful musical from theater to screen.Pressed to describe the pitfalls of such an endeavor and to explain how they managed to avoid them in producing the movie version of "Les Miserables," Mackintosh told UPI: "What I didn't want to do was, first of all, put anything on the screen just because it was in the stage show. Neither did Tom, neither did any of us. We wanted to make a movie. I thought it would only have a chance of working if it -- in this far more realistic medium -- seemed natural and had a look that you believed in entirely cinematically.""The reason I knew we were going to be able to do something interesting is because from the very first meetings, Cameron said, 'I don't want to just put the show on screen,'" Fellner recalled. "So, immediately there, you think if the owners of the brand and the creative DNA of it are saying we want to do something new, then at that point I knew it would be possible for us to work together and make a film. The pitfalls on the physical side was if we only appeal to the fans, then with a budget like this, the film wouldn't work. So, it was really critical we made a film that had the DNA of the show and worked absolutely for the fans, but also had the potential to break out and create a whole new audience for 'Les Miserables.'"The film opens nationwide Dec. 25.

PASADENA, Calif., Aug. 20 (UPI) -- The U.S. Mars rover Curiosity fired its laser for the first time on Mars to investigate a fist-size rock dubbed "Coronation," NASA officials said Monday.The mission's chemistry and camera instrument, ChemCam, hit the fist-sized rock with 30 laser pulses during a 10-second period, NASA said in a release. Each pulse sends more than a million watts of power, exciting atoms in the rock into an ionized, glowing plasma, NASA said. ChemCam then traps the light with a telescope and analyzes it for information about elements in the target. "We got a great spectrum of Coronation -- lots of signal," said Roger Wiens, ChemCam principal investigator of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.NASA officials said the goal was to act as "target practice" for characterizing the laser instrument, as well as provide additional value. Researchers will check whether the composition changed as the pulses progressed. A change could indicate dust or other surface material being penetrated to reveal different composition.The spectrometers record intensity at 6,144 different wavelengths of ultraviolet, visible and infrared light, NASA said. Curiosity landed on Mars two weeks ago to begin a two-year mission to assess whether a study area inside Gale Crater ever had environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., May 4 (UPI) -- The death of a University of Virginia women's lacrosse player was an accident, the lawyer for the men's lacrosse team player charged with the crime said.George Huguely, 22, of Chevy Chase, Md., was charged with first-degree murder within hours of the discovery of the body of 22-year-old Yeardley Love of Cockeysville, Md., in her off-campus apartment."We are confident that Ms. Love's death was not intended but an accident with a tragic outcome," attorney Francis Lawrence said Tuesday.Love's body was found early Monday and police said it showed signs of physical trauma. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.The Daily Progress newspaper in Charlottesville said a police affidavit indicated Huguely admitted to an altercation with Love and that "he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall."Investigators said they were told Huguely and Love, both seniors, had a previous relationship.Huguely, a midfielder, had appeared in all of Virginia's 15 games this season, scoring four goals and assisting on three others. The Cavaliers men's team is 14-1 and ranked No. 1 in the nation.Love, a defender, had played in 15 of her team's 18 games, starting three.

BAGHDAD, March 7 (UPI) -- A U.S. Army unit discovered what appears to be an abandoned al-Qaida torture house six miles from Baghdad in Iraq.Lt. Col. Mark Solomon told The Boston Herald that the house was equipped with handcuffs attached to the floor and to a window and hooks on the walls. He said his squadron also found material used to train terrorists."It has certainly given us a window into the world of the enemy in a very real way," he said in an interview via satellite telephone.The house had been abandoned, Solomon said. He described it as being one of three houses in a compound tucked away in a remote area."It makes you feel good to have found it and denied the enemy the ability to use it anymore," Solomon said.His troops began searching for the compound after hearing stories from local residents of a house that had been used for torture.

WASHINGTON, June 16 (UPI) -- The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is seeking the approval of its five commissioners for a review of cellphone radiation guidelines, a spokeswoman said.The current guidelines are 15 years old, The Washington Post reported Friday. In the mid-1990s, cellphones had not become almost universal in the United States.In a statement, the agency suggested the review is simply routine."We are confident that, as set, the emissions guidelines for devices pose no risk to consumers," Tammy Sun, a spokeswoman, said.The FCC said it is especially concerned with the potential health effects of cellphone use on children. A World Health Organization panel, which concluded last year that the phones are "possibly carcinogenic," said children are more at risk of harm from radiation because they have thinner skulls.Companies supplying wireless phones and their trade group have said they believe the current standards are adequate.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 25 (UPI) -- A rare left-right bloc of House members vowed after a narrow loss to redouble efforts to curb a national-security program that amasses Americans' phone records."This is only the beginning," Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said after the House voted 216 to 205 to defeat a proposal he sponsored with Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., to restrict the National Security Agency's ability to collect Americans' phone records.The measure -- an amendment to the military-spending bill that later passed -- would have limited NSA phone surveillance to specific targets of law-enforcement investigations, not broad dragnets.It would have also required the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's secret opinions to be made available to lawmakers and opinion summaries to be made available to the public.Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said lawmakers would keep coming back with legislation to curtail the dragnets for "metadata" records, whether through phone records or Internet surveillance.At the very least, the USA Patriot Act section the NSA and FBI cite to justify mass phone surveillance will be allowed to expire in 2015, he said."It's going to end -- now or later," Nadler said. "The only question is when and on what terms."House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., promised to draft a bill in the fall to add more privacy protections to government surveillance programs.Their threats and promises came after the House vote, which was far closer than originally expected, despite last-minute lobbying by the Obama administration and House intelligence panel members.Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who as head of the House rarely casts a ballot, voted against the amendment.Indeed, Boehner found himself in the rare position of being on the same side as President Barack Obama. He was joined in opposing the amendment by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., a supporter of the Tea Party movement.Ultimately, 83 Democrats joined 134 Republicans to defeat the measure. Voting for the measure were 94 Republicans and 111 Democrats.The unusual alliance of the House's right and left wings was dubbed "the wingnut coalition" by Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, who called Amash "the chief wingnut."He said he jokingly gave it that name because "you have the right wing and the left wing working together and trying to get things done.""Wingnut" usually refers pejoratively to a person in politics who holds extreme, often irrational, political views, usually with a religious overtone.The fight will now shift to the Senate, where Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. -- longtime critics of NSA dragnet collection and storage of personal records -- have promised to take up the cause."National security is of paramount importance, yet the NSA's dragnet collection of Americans' phone records violates innocent Americans' privacy rights and should not continue as its exists today," Udall, a member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Unconventional Threats, said after the vote."I am urging the president and the NSA to join this growing bipartisan coalition and work with Congress to focus the NSA's surveillance efforts on terrorists and spies -- not innocent Americans."The White House has said Obama would veto any proposal to limit NSA surveillance.

KIGALI, Rwanda, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday he and his wife shouldn't talk about the New York City mayoral race because many of the candidates are friends.Clinton said "everyone understands" he and Hillary Clinton won't be involved in the race "as long as our personal friends and people we feel obligations [to] are involved," CNN reported.Interviewed in Kigali, Rwanda, during a six-day tour of Africa, the ex-president said "there are too many people running for mayor who have been my supporters, who supported her [Hillary Clinton] for senator, for president."He added there were "literally five people" in the race, including a Republican candidate, who were "personal friends.""Since they are, I shouldn't talk about them," Clinton added.

With her upcoming clothing line, Kelly Osbourne hopes to make shopping for plus-size clothes a little less miserable of an experience.	Posted By GABRIELLE LEVY, UPI.com | Sept. 5, 2013 at 12:16 PM | Updated Sept. 5, 2013 at 6:27 PM | 0 comments

| License Photo	Sept. 5 (UPI) -- Although she no longer needs them herself, Kelly Osbourne remembers what it's like to be a big girl struggling to find cute clothes in plus sizes.Now the "Fashion Police"-woman says her upcoming line of clothes aims to be all-inclusive, even for the ladies who need a few Xs on their tags."No one takes notice of a fat girl in fashion,” she said. "That’s the truth! It’s sad.""That’s why I love women like Beth Ditto who are doing their own clothes," she continued. "That’s why when my line comes out I’ll never make anything that won’t be translated to plus-size as well. Because everyone deserves to wear fashion."Fashion designers have notoriously struggled to (or just plain ignored) create quality, on-trend clothing for women above about a size 12. But recent efforts to improve plus size options, vary the range of body types shown in fashion magazines -- or at least shame clothes makers into doing better -- may, finally, be having an effect.
