BRUSSELS, March 16 (UPI) -- Cypriot officials reported a run on banks after the European Union said a $13 billion bailout deal for Cyprus would require an unprecedented tax on deposits.The deal includes an agreement for Cyprus to raise taxes, cut its deficit and reduce its dependence on the banking sector, the BBC reported Saturday."The Euro Group was able to reach a political agreement with the Cypriot authorities on the cornerstones of this agreement," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro Group. "The assistance is warranted to safeguard financial stability in Cyprus and the eurozone as a whole.""We don't want a Band-Aid. We want something that lasts, that is durable and sustainable," said International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde, who participated in negotiations on the bailout.Bank depositors are expected to contribute $7.5 billion to the package through a one-time 6.75 percent tax levied on bank accounts of less than $130,800 and a 9.9 percent tax on accounts worth more than that.The taxes are already being collected to safeguard against massive withdrawals of funds from the country, officials said.The Qatari-owned news network al-Jazeera reported Saturday people lined up at ATMs to try to get their money out of banks.Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the situation was "is serious but not tragic, there is no reason to panic."He said the government had to choose "between saving the economy and a disorderly default.""There is a general political sentiment that it is not acceptable to be bailing out a country, and thereby putting European taxpayers' money at risk, to basically protect Russian depositors in Cypriot banks," said economist Jacob Funk Kirkegaard at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.There has been speculation Russia could help finance the bailout by granting a $2.5 billion loan to Cyprus. Cypriot Finance Minister Michael Sarris is scheduled to visit Moscow Monday, the BBC said.

STRATFORD, Conn., Dec. 13 (UPI) -- The preliminary design for an experimental vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for the U.S. military is to be produced by Sikorsky Innovations.The Phase 1 contract was issued to the Sikorsky Aircraft subsidiary by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and is worth $15 million. Period of performance length is 22 months"Sikorsky has a solid legacy of developing game-changing advances, and the DARPA X-Plane program is exactly the kind of project that Sikorsky Innovations was created to execute," said Chris VanBuiten, vice president of Sikorsky Innovations."We are an agile, networked team dedicated to demonstrating innovative solutions to the toughest challenges in vertical flight. This program explores a generation of innovation that has yet to be introduced, and we have the opportunity to develop our novel design of the X-Plane concept with our partner at [Lockheed Martin] Skunk Works. It is an exciting project, and we are thrilled to be among the contract winners." Sikorsky Innovations and Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works will develop the aircraft's Unmanned Rotor Blown Wing concept, in which fixed wing aerodynamics and advanced rotor control are integrated to provide a low-complexity configuration.DARPA aims for an aircraft eventually developed to have a hover efficiency of 75 percent or more and a cruise lift-to-drag ratio of 10 or more.

LONGVIEW, Texas, May 4 (UPI) -- A 79-year-old Texas professor hospitalized with cancer said he preserved his 45-year-long perfect attendance record by teaching via teleconference.Professor William Kielhorn of LeTourneau University in Longview said he was one class short of completing 45 years of teaching without missing a single day when he was checked into the intensive care unit at Good Shepherd Medical Center due to chemotherapy complications for the treatment of his stage four colon cancer, ABC News reported Tuesday.He said his daughter, Martha Croft, and granddaughter, Courtney Bellamy, made arrangements for him to use the Internet to teleconference with his engineering class Thursday and complete his perfect record."I felt the students had paid for the courses and the least I could do was show up and teach," Kielhorn said. Bellamy said her grandfather has recently had trouble speaking, but the problem seemed to disappear while he was teaching."It was perfect, it was strong, it was just unbelievable really," she said. "I had not seen him talk like that in a long time."

BRUSSELS, Jan. 15 (UPI) -- A U.S. conservation group says it applauds a European Parliament action calling for moratoria on ivory sales in an attempt to curb rampant elephant poaching.The Parliament's resolution emphasizes its view that wildlife trafficking is a serious economic, national security and environmental threat, the Wildlife Conservation Society said Wednesday.The resolution calls for renewed action by the European Union member states to stop the crisis through restrictions on all commercial imports, exports and domestic sales and purchases of tusks and ivory products until wild elephant populations are no longer threatened by illegal killing."I am very glad the European Parliament fully supports me in this important challenge," MEP Gerban-Jan Gerbrandy, who led the resolution's introduction, said. "I want poaching to be seen as organized crime. That involves higher penalties, higher priority and specialist investigators. We must avoid the extinction of the most iconic animals that roam on earth. Europe cannot lag behind anymore. We have to stand up against illegal poaching."African elephants are being lost at an unprecedented rate and the demand for ivory shows no decline, WCS officials said."This landmark resolution passed by the European Parliament shows the rising amount of global concern for the toll that the ivory trade is taking on wild populations of elephants," said John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs."Without a moratorium on all ivory sales, there will always be a way for traffickers to continue this illicit trade," he said. "In order to protect elephants on the ground, we must take steps to cut off the market for these products."It is time to close domestic ivory markets."

| License Photo	DURBAN, South Africa, Jan. 13 (UPI) -- Louis Oosthuizen came from five strokes behind Sunday, catching Scott Jamison and winning the European Tour's Volvo Golf Champions event in South Africa.Oosthuizen, despite a late bogey, shot a 6-under-par 66 in the final round for a 72-hole total of 16-under 272. Jamison, who entered the fourth round with a five-stroke lead, shot even-par 72 Sunday and was 15 under for the tournament.Thongchai Jaidee, who shot 68 Sunday, finished third overall at 14-under. Padraig Harrington came in fourth at 12-under and Danny Willett and Julien Quesne tied for fifth. Harrington and Willett each matched Jaidee's 68 Sunday while Quesne shot 71.Jamieson seemed in control with the big lead and birdies Sunday at Nos. 3 and 4 but he suffered a double bogey 6 at the fifth hole. He had 10 consecutive pars before a bogey at the 16th. A closing birdie got him back to even on the day.Meanwhile, Oosthuizen, who struggled with a six-bogey round that led to a 2-over 74 Saturday, pulled back into contention with birdies at 2 and 3 and two more at 6 and 8 in making the turn in 32.He added birdies at 10 and 11 that moved him into the lead. A birdie at the par-5 14th hole gave him a two-stroke cushion that survived his bogey at the 16th hole.It was the 10th professional win overall for Oosthuizen and sixth title on the European Tour. He has at least one European Tour win each year since 2010.

Obama: Yemen packages had explosivesNEWARK, N.J., Oct. 29 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday two suspicious packages containing explosive material shipped from Yemen were addressed to Chicago synagogues.The packages were spotted at airports in Birmingham, England, and the United Arab Emirates late Thursday and prompted alerts at U.S. airports that resulted in plane searches at Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia, as well as searches of UPS trucks in New York. Obama said the packages were believed sent by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, an offshoot of al-Qaida that is known to want to commit terrorist attacks in the United States. Administration officials said the packages were rendered "inert."Obama said initial examination showed the packages "did apparently contain explosive material." As a result, additional protective measures have been put into place.Obama pledged "to spare no effort to investigate the origins (of the packages) and their connection" to terrorists.Obama said the United States is working closely with Yemeni officials and administration officials have spoken directly with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh."Last night, intelligence and law enforcement agencies discovered potential suspicious packages on two planes in transit to the United States," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement Friday.Authorities in the United States and abroad worked together, identified and examined "two suspicious packages, one in East Midlands, United Kingdom, and one in Dubai," Gibbs said.Officials gave the all-clear sign for Newark Liberty International Airport following Friday morning's search.A law enforcement official told CNN the suspicious package in Britain was an altered toner cartridge, containing wires, a circuit board and a white powder. It had been shipped from Sana'a, Yemen, to Chicago. Officials said a similar package was found in Dubai, United Arab Emirates."The president directed U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Department of Homeland Security to take steps to ensure the safety and security of the American people, and to determine whether these threats are a part of any additional terrorist plotting," Gibbs said.Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the failed bombing attempt aboard a Northwest Airlines flight above Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it was beefing up security.Halliburton says cement report wrongHOUSTON, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- Halliburton Friday criticized a report concluding the cement mixture used on the BP Gulf of Mexico well that exploded was deficient and shifted blame to BP.The presidential commission headed by former Sen. Bob Graham appointed to investigate the deadly April 19 disaster and subsequent massive oil spill released a report Thursday saying tests performed on a cement mixture comparable to that used by Halliburton showed the mixture was unstable. The report also accused Halliburton of being aware of the mixture's deficiencies.The Deepwater Horizon oil rig was owned by Transocean and leased by BP.In a statement posted on its Web site, Halliburton said internal tests conducted on a cement slurry mixture that didn't meet standards in February were preliminary and the mixture was not the same as that used on the ill-fated well."Halliburton believes that significant differences between its internal cement tests and the commission's test results may be due to differences in the cement materials tested," the company said. "The commission tested off-the-shelf cement and additives, whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Halliburton's tests were conducted."BP subsequently instructed Halliburton to increase the amount of retarder in the slurry formulation from eight gallons per 100 sacks of cement to nine gallons per 100 sacks of cement," Halliburton said. "Tests, including thickening time and compressive strength, were performed on the nine gallon formulation (the cement formulation actually pumped) and were shared with BP before the cementing job had begun. A foam stability test was not conducted on the nine gallon formulation."Halliburton noted cementing wells "is a complex endeavor" and failures are not uncommon in the industry."Halliburton believes that had BP conducted a cement bond log test, or had BP and others properly interpreted a negative-pressure test, these tests would have revealed any problems with Halliburton's cement. … BP, as the well owner and operator, decided not to run a cement bond log test even though the appropriate personnel and equipment were on the rig and available to run that test," Halliburton said.The statement again blamed BP's well design for the disaster as well as the failure of Transocean's blowout preventer.Gunman wounds 3 at Nevada WalmartRENO, Nev., Oct. 29 (UPI) -- Police surrounded a Walmart in Reno, Nev., after an armed man wounded three people there Friday morning.The store was evacuated, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. Scores of police from local, state and federal agencies gathered in the parking lot with the shooter still believed to be inside the store.Walmart reported that one of the wounded was in critical condition. Police described one as a manager at the store.Reno Police Lt. Mohammad Rafaqat said the gunman might be a Walmart employee.The shooting occurred at around 8:30 a.m.The first responders split into three teams, one for evacuation of the store, one to get the injured to medical help and the third to find and arrest the shooter, the Gazette-Journal said.FBI: Washington shooter may be MarineWASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- A U.S. Marine with a grudge may be behind a series of shootings at government targets in Washington, officials said Friday.The National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Va., became a target Thursday night for the second time, The Washington Post reported.The FBI said its agents are working on the assumption the same person is behind that shooting and three earlier ones. The agency said Thursday the same gun was used to fire at the museum and the Pentagon Oct. 17 and 19, and this Tuesday at an empty recruiting office in Chantilly, Va.At a Washington news conference Friday, FBI officials said the gunman should surrender to authorities. They did not give details on why they believe the shooter is likely to be a Marine.Museum employees found bullet holes in a window Friday morning. The shooting occurred while the museum was closed overnight.Gwenn Adams, a spokeswoman, said the museum was shut down for the day while investigators examine the scene. She said it was expected to reopen Saturday morning.At least 94 dead in Thailand floodingBANGKOK, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- Flooding in Thailand has killed at least 94 people in the last three weeks, health officials said Friday.The Emergency Medical Institute said the victims include 78 men and 16 women, Thai News Agency reported. The Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department said the waters had receded in 11 provinces, but major problems continued in the other 27.In Bangkok, the Chao Phraya River was expected to crest by early afternoon.Around 3,000 businesses with 250,000 employees have been disrupted by the floods, and 306 schools were underwater, disaster officials said.Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Wednesday the floods, the worst in the country in several years, might be a man-made disaster, the Bangkok Post reported."Heavy flooding in many provinces is caused by construction that blocks the flow of the water. After the water recedes we'll have to look into this problem again," he said.

WICHITA, Kan., April 3 (UPI) -- A new clinic offering abortion and women's health services is set to open in Wichita Kan., on the site of slain doctor George Tiller's clinic.South Wind Women's Center will perform abortions only during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, The Wichita Eagle reported. Tiller, who was killed in 2009, became nationally known as one of the few doctors in the United States willing to perform late-term abortions.Julie Burkhart, founder of Trust Women, told the Eagle on Monday she is unsure of the exact day the clinic will open but she said it was taking appointments.Trust Women, its website says, was founder to help women "control their reproductive lives, heave healthy pregnancies and deliver safely" and looks to "expand abortion care and maternal healthcare ... by opening more clinics."The new Wichita clinic has also attracted its first protesters, Burkhart said. An anti-abortion rights group, Kansans for Life, also tried to stop it by going to court to have the building rezoned.Burkhart has a court date Thursday.She says Mark Holick, a Wichita pastor, has threatened her.Tiller operated Women's Health Care Services from 1975 until his death. The clinic was firebombed in 1986, he was shot and wounded in 1993 and then, in 2009, killed while serving as an usher at Reformation Lutheran Church.

LONDON, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- The children of the British nurse found hanged after she answered a prank call about Kate Middleton's pregnancy said her death left a void in their lives.In a joint tribute Saturday to Jacintha Saldanha, her children -- Lisha, 14, and Junal, 16, said, "We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives. ... "The house is an empty dwelling without your presence," the BBC reported.Saldanha, 46, was found dead last week after she received a prank phone call from two Australian radio personalities impersonating Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. They asked about Middleton's condition and the nurse passed the call along to a colleague who gave out private information on the duchess of Cambridge, hospitalized for acute morning sickness.Her husband, Benedict Barboza, and her children attended a mass at Westminster Cathedral on Saturday. Memorial services have already been conducted at the hospital and in Bristol, where her husband and children live. Saldanha's funeral will be Monday in Karnataka, India.Barboza called his wife "the light in my darkness, who always showed me the way forward. From the day we met, you always stood by me in times of hardship and happiness. I feel a part of me has been ripped out."On Thursday an inquest at Westminster's Coroner Court heard that Saldanha was found hanged and left three suicide notes.King Edward VII Hospital has said managers tried to reassure Saldanha no one blamed her for forwarding the call through to the duchess' ward. The hospital's chief executive officer, John Lofthouse, said in a letter to Parliament member Keith Vaz that protocols were in place for dealing with calls to "high-profile" patients."Part of our procedure is to take the name and number of the individual and call them back. This is in order to verify that the call is genuine," Lofthouse said in the letter, released Friday. "We also empower our staff to use their judgment. On this particular occasion, Jacintha believed that the call was genuine, and she felt it appropriate to put the call through. We stand by her judgment."He said Saldanha would not have faced disciplinary proceedings "because she had been the victim of a cruel trick."

March. 11 (UPI) -- Thanks to Russian drivers' love of their dashboard video cameras, the world is by now quite familiar with just how crazy the roads can get.Now meet Alexei Volkov, known locally as "the Punisher," a bus driver who has turned his dashboard cam into a tool to shame irresponsible drivers.When drivers get rude, or, as often happens, instigate accidents in order to perpetrate insurance scams, Volkov said he rams his bus into the offending car, and posts the footage on YouTube."The Punisher" has another nickname, too: "teacher of teachers." (In Russian slang, "teacher" is a negative nickname for drivers who, irritated by slow drivers, will move in front and then slam on the brakes.)Volkov said he has been in more than 100 collisions in his bus -- and has won any case in which a scammer tried to sue him. The bus company management is also fine with Volkov's antics, he said, since damage to the bus is usually minor and insurance has paid for repairs.

Wiki
James Edward Franco (born April 19, 1978) is an American actor, film director, producer, screenwriter, author, painter, performance artist and professor at New York University. He left college in order to pursue acting and started off his career by making guest appearances on television series in the 1990s. Franco landed a lead part on the short-lived cult hit television program Freaks and Geeks and later achieved recognition for playing the titular character in the TV biographical film James Dean (2001), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe Award. He achieved international fame with his portrayals of Harry Osborn in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.
Franco is critically acclaimed as an actor. He has done both dramatic and comedic work in projects and has appeared in an eclectic range of projects since the 2000s, ranging from period to contemporary pieces, and from major Hollywood productions to less publicized indie films, as well as fantasy movies to biopics and soap operas. Other notable films include Pineapple Express, a stoner comedy that earned him his second Golden Globes nomination, the Harvey Milk-biopic Milk (both 2008) as well as Danny Boyle's 2010 movie 127 Hours, about real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston's struggle to free his hand from a boulder. His performance in 127 Hours earned him nominations for many high-profile awards, including the Academy Awards, Golden Globe and SAG Awards.
Franco has hosted Saturday Night Live twice as well as the 83rd Academy Awards with Anne Hathaway. He volunteers for the Art of Elysium charity.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
