| License Photo	CHICAGO, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. airplane maker Boeing Co. is proceeding with steps to build a stretch version of the grounded Dreamliner 787, a source told The Wall Street Journal.The Journal reported Saturday a source with information on the company's plans said Boeing transported a major section of the 787-9 from Japan to Charleston, S.C., and another section was expected to arrive from Italy within a week.The 787-9 is a second 787 option that will be 20-feet longer than the stock model and will carry 40 more passengers.Boeing is moving ahead with the new model even though the first 50 787 Dreamliner jets are grounded around the world, as investigators look into a series of electrical fires that involved the jet's ion-lithium batteries.Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said this week investigators were narrowing down possible causes for the fires, but the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration issued an update on the investigation Friday that did not suggest the probe would be over soon.

SUNNYVALE, Calif., March 28 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin has started a technology initiative to expand its collaboration with Silicon Valley companies to meet U.S. government technology needs.Lockheed said the Lockheed Martin Silicon Valley Alliance technology hub will give the government better visibility into innovative technology being developed locally -- including software -- and is inviting companies to join in it.By doing so, the companies would achieve greater access to the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and other government agencies. Lockheed would facilitate partnerships that mature the technological innovations into products for government."Lockheed Martin has played an ultra-high-tech role in the Silicon Valley story since 1956 when we opened our facility in Sunnyvale, adjacent to Moffett Field," said Tory Bruno, Lockheed Martin's president of Strategic and Missile Defense Systems."The government market catalyzed the initial growth of all high-tech industries in the San Francisco Bay Area. Now, through the Lockheed Martin Silicon Valley Alliance, we can help to reconnect today's companies to that market, which continues to be substantial despite a challenging economy."

BOULDER, Colo., Dec. 14 (UPI) -- A U.S. researcher says a swarm of tiny robots could be a better solution to accomplishing tasks than one big one and has made "ping-pong" ball-sized examples.University of Colorado at Boulder computer scientist Nikolaus Correll and his research team have developed a basic robotic "building block" which they hope to reproduce in large quantities to develop increasingly complex systems, the university reported Friday.They've created a swarm of 20 robots, each the size of a Ping Pong ball, which they've dubbed "droplets." When the droplets swarm together, Correll said, they form a "liquid that thinks."Swarms of tiny intelligent robotic devices could be for containing an oil spill or to self-assemble into a piece of hardware after being launched separately into space, he said.The "droplets" will be used to demonstrate self-assembly and swarm-intelligent behaviors such as pattern recognition, sensor-based motion and adaptive shape change, Correll said.These behaviors could then be transferred to large swarms for water- or air-based tasks.Correll said such distributed intelligence systems could someday accomplish even the most complex tasks."Every living organism is made from a swarm of collaborating cells," he said. "Perhaps someday, our [robot] swarms will colonize space where they will assemble habitats and lush gardens for future space explorers."

| License Photo	NEW YORK {WOMENSENEWS}--The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI is a "holy shakeup" in the Catholic church, according to an association advocating for the ordination of female priests, the National Catholic Reporter reported Monday. "The Pope’s resignation is a positive sign that the Spirit is at work renewing the church," the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests said in a press statement.
"We need a top down shakeup and new structures of accountability in the Roman Catholic Church," said the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests, which ordains women outside the formal structures of the church. "Married priests, women priests, are only a few of the necessary steps the Vatican needs to take in a more just and compassionate church that honors the gifts of God in the people of God."
The pope announced on Monday that he is resigning for health reasons and will step down on Feb. 28. A papal conclave will follow to elect his successor, who will be in place by the end of March, in time for Easter, The Los Angeles Times reported Jan. 11.
Pope Benedict is the first Pope to resign since the 1500s. He was elected in 2005 to succeed the enormously popular John Paul.
During his years as leader of the Vatican, Pope Benedict strengthened the Church’s opposition to female priests, alienating some women. He also worked to reinforce Church teachings against abortion and birth control.
Benedict eventually accepted to review the church’s stance on contraception, Business Week reported Jan. 11. He commissioned a 200-page report to explore the effect that condoms could have in stopping the spread of infectious diseases, including AIDS. The effort eventually yielded to a more practical attitude to sex. In 2010, Benedict said that condom use can be justified in “single cases,” for example by sex workers, as a necessary “humanization of sexuality.”
Pope Benedict turned the Church back to its orthodox roots, Forbes wrote Jan. 11. He has been criticized for making insulting remarks to Muslims, financial scandals during his tenure and doing little to address the priest sex abuse scandals and for calling homosexuality an intrinsic moral evil.
He later apologized for the church’s shortcomings in not better protecting children from wayward priests and he met and prayed with victims of abuse.Read more at Women's eNews

NEW YORK, Aug. 29 (UPI) -- A New York City hotel maid is seeking evidence in a lawsuit against a French politician she says assaulted her, officials said.The woman whose sex assault accusation brought down International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn -- but never led to his prosecution because lawyers determined her accusations too flimsy -- is seeking a transcript of a telephone call placed by the maid, Nafissatou Diallo, to an illegal alien reported to be her fiance, the New York Post said Tuesday.New York City prosecutors said Diallo referenced Strauss-Kahn's substantial wealth during the conversation – an allegation Diallo's lawyer denied.The Post reported that federal lawyers will seek to squash the subpoena filed by Diallo's lawyer on grounds of "federal law and the sovereign immunity of the United States government."

WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 (UPI) -- A terrorist facing trial in the United States "has greater legal protection than a U.S. Marine" alleging a sexual assault, an assault victim's husband said.Ben Klay, a former Marine who served in Iraq, spoke at a Washington news conference with a bipartisan group of senators vowing to press ahead with an effort to put the power to conduct criminal proceedings in military sexual-assaults cases in the hands of independent military prosecutors instead of the military chain of command.Such a move "will enhance our military readiness," Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., told reporters, flanked by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and five other senators."This proposal will strengthen morale," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.The lawmakers said they were among 46 senators who so far supported the measure, but they said they could need more than 51 votes to win passage.Amendments directly related to military policy are typically allowed to pass by a simple majority.But Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., told reporters this week the measure was controversial, so it would probably require at least 60 votes to pass.The final decision rests with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.Aides told The Washington Post Reid had not yet decided how many votes would be required.Even if Reid decides the proposal needs only 51 votes to pass, several GOP senators have said they may oppose the measure with a filibuster.The Pentagon is against the measure, saying sexual-assault prosecutions must stay with military commanders to maintain good order and discipline."Critics say moving these decisions out of the chain of command will diminish good order and discipline," Gillibrand said."Well I have news for you -- with 26,000 cases of sexual assault, rape and unwanted sexual contact last year alone, we don't have the good order and discipline that our military needs," she said.The Defense Department reported in May as many as 26,000 military members were sexually assaulted last year, up 37 percent from 2011's 19,000.Gillibrand told reporters Wednesday there was "zero accountability" in the ranks for dealing with assault and rape allegations, despite two decades of assurances the military had a "zero tolerance" for such crimes.The Gillibrand-led proposal is expected to be introduced as an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill. Debate on that bill is expected to start the week after next."We need a few more Republicans," Paul told the National Journal magazine after the news conference."I've got a list of Republicans I'm talking to," he said. "We need probably eight more Republicans and a few more Democrats. But I think there is a lot of momentum."Klay told reporters after his wife, Ariana Klay, a former Marine officer and Iraq War veteran, reported she was assaulted while serving at the Marine Barracks in Washington, her commander wrote "she deserved ill-treatment for wearing running shorts and makeup."Klay said the command-appointed investigator "compared rape to prostitution or marrying a rich man."Ariana Klay faced a year of retaliation after filing a complaint before her accused rapists' trial, in which she endured 15 hours of "degrading testimony" on the witness stand, Ben Klay said.The prosecution's closing statement included a Marine officer reading the definitions of offensive, sexually degrading terms for women, Klay said."When I finally got to testify, not a single question was asked that would have helped prosecute," he told reporters. "Not a single question about the day of the assault or its effects on my wife. When I asked why, I was told that would be distracting to the court."Klay said the U.S. military was "not organized to address sexual assault" and the law should not force military commanders to deal with that responsibility."It gives commanders who do not have an interest in proving the worst failures of their command the authority to decide whether those failures happened. They cannot be impartial, nor can those who work for them," he said."Even an alleged terrorist on U.S. soil has greater legal protection than a U.S. Marine," Klay said, his voice breaking as he discussed his wife's case.

Impatient brushers with $300 to spare might want to consider this high-tech toothbrush from Blizzident. Posted By KATE STANTON, UPI.com | Oct. 2, 2013 at 8:59 PM | 0 comments

Oct. 2 (UPI) -- If you can't spare the two minutes dentists usually recommend for manual toothbrushing, Blizzident has come up with a high-tech 3D toothbrush that's supposed to clean your teeth in a matter of seconds. "All Blizzident-bristles are tailored to your own teeth," the manufacturer states on its website, where the futuristic brushes go for $299. "They are placed on the surface of your teeth in a 45 degree angle. They are also aligned exactly along your gumline in a 45 degree angle."Blizzident brushes are meant to last one year, after which a replacement brush sells for $159. The makers require customers to have impressions taken of their mouth by a dentist. Then a 3D printer fashions a customized toothbrush with 400 bristles and slits for dental floss. "You simply bite and release quickly 10 to 15 times," the company explains. "It's something out of the ordinary, a different approach," British Dental Association advisor Professor Damien Walmsley told BBC News, though he said safety and technique are more important than tools. "It's not what you use, it's how you brush, it's your technique. It needs to be checked that it's completely safe."
