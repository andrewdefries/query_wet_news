| License Photo	LONDON, Dec. 16 (UPI) -- "Doctor Who" writer-producer Steven Moffat has confirmed characters Amy and Rory Pond are being written out of the British sci-fi show, the BBC said.Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill have played the husband and wife team since Matt Smith took over the role of the time-traveling Doctor early last year."The final days of the Ponds are coming," Moffat said at a London screening of the "Doctor Who" Christmas episode. "I'm not telling you when or how, but that story is going to come to a heartbreaking end."The show-runner went on to say the Doctor was going to meet "a new friend" who has not yet been cast."We had the most incredible journey," Smith said of working with Gillan and Darvill. "We took over the show and we've really had to hold hands and help each other through it. So it's very disappointing, but one has to remember that this show is about change and regeneration, and that's what galvanizes it and pushes it forwards."Smith is the 11th actor to play the Doctor on the long-running series.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- One of the leading campaign consultants in contemporary politics has hung out a shingle in Hollywood, adding to the long-running symbiotic relationship between politics and show business.Mike Murphy -- who has prospered guiding political campaigns for Republican candidates including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Iran-Contra figure Oliver North -- has taken up residence in Hollywood, with aspirations of becoming a filmmaker.Murphy, 42, told the Los Angeles Times his political experience -- including working for the past year as a consultant to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- has prepared him for the challenge."I've been selling stories to people for 20 years," he said. "There's a narrative to every campaign, with ups and downs and triumphs and reversals."Then there's the toughening up that inevitably goes with spending 20 years in the trenches in big-time politics. Veterans of the Hollywood wars, however, frequently admonish wannabes that succeeding in the movie business is one of the toughest challenges in life."I know how it sounds," Murphy told the Times. "I've read enough screenwriter memoirs to know that if I was a Vegas odds maker, I'd predict failure. But no one counted on me making it in politics either."If it's true what they say about what matters most in Hollywood -- that it's who you know, not what you know -- then Murphy has a potent champion in Schwarzenegger."Mike is the best, whether he's writing a great opening line for a press conference or knowing the history of every political campaign," Schwarzenegger told the paper. "Hollywood is like politics -- if you have real substance, you're in. And if you have nothing to say, you'll be changing agents 15 times and knocking on doors forever."Murphy wouldn't be the first political professional to break into the movie business. Far from it, in fact."The West Wing" alone has become something of a cottage industry for people who have found an outlet to spin their Washington experience into studio employment.The show has, at one time or another, engaged the services of Patrick Caddell, a pollster for former president Jimmy Carter; Dee Dee Myers, a media adviser to former President Bill Clinton; Lawrence O'Donnell, a former senior adviser to the late U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan; and Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to Clinton who currently advises Democratic nominee for president Sen. John Kerry.Of course, the public is more familiar with people who crossed over from entertainment to politics -- such as Schwarzenegger, former President Ronald Reagan, the late singer Sonny Bono and even Fred Grandy, who parlayed his role as Gopher on "The Love Boat" into a brief career representing Iowa in Congress.There have even been instances where the symbiosis between politics and show business was so close it was impossible -- and probably unnecessary -- to say whether Hollywood was invading Washington or vice versa.Consider "K Street," a send-up of the games political insiders play in the nation's capital that ran on HBO last year.The show was produced by Hollywood pros Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, with consulting help from political professionals including former Reagan media adviser Michael Deaver. The cast included professional actors such as John Slattery, as well as high-profile Washington figures including James Carville and Mary Matalin.The production staff also included inside-the-Beltway specialists such as Stuart Stevens, who worked on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, and Jon Macks, a co-producer on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" who has worked on political campaigns for such politicians as Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., and former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus.Of all the show business truisms "K Street" illustrated, perhaps the most significant is that hits are rare in Hollywood. The show was critically panned and was not renewed.Murphy sounded a note of realism -- maybe even resignation -- about how his Hollywood adventure might turn out."My goal is to pound out a commercial screenplay, maybe a talky dark comedy, and then see what happens, which of course could mean it getting made into an Adam Sandler flying-saucer invasion comedy," he said.And that's if he's lucky.Murphy may be considered a newcomer -- if not a neophyte -- in Hollywood, but he seems to have picked up one of the most essential points from reading all those trades and screenwriting memoirs."As embarrassing as it is to say," he said, "what I'd really like to do is direct the movie too."--(Please send comments to nationaldesk@upi.com.)

NEW YORK, March 28 (UPI) -- Areas of western India completely devoid of wilderness and with high human populations are attracting backyard wildlife including leopards, experts say.A study led by Vidya Athreaya of the Wildlife Conservations Society found as many as five adult large carnivores, including leopards and striped hyenas, per 38 square miles, a density never before reported in a human-dominated landscape.Evidence from camera traps showed leopards often ranged close to houses at night although remaining largely undetected by the public, and despite this close proximity between leopards and people there are few reports of attacks in the region, a release from WCS headquarters in New York reported Thursday.The research was conducted in the western state of Maharashtra."Human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict, including human deaths in adjoining areas," WCS big cat expert Ullas Karanth said.The camera traps also photographed rusty spotted cats, small Indian civets, Indian foxes, jungle cats, jackals and mongoose, the researchers said."The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other's presence," Karanth said.

AGADIR, Morocco, March 25 (UPI) -- Michael Hoey used three late birdies to cement the lead Sunday and went on to post a come-from-behind victory at the Trophee Hassan II in Morocco.Hoey fired a pair of 7-under 65s over the last two rounds to claim his fourth European Tour title.After falling behind third-round co-leader Damien McGrane on the 11th hole Sunday, Hoey birdied the 14th and 15th to claim the lead, later padding his advantage with another birdie at the par-five 17th.He finished three strokes clear of the field at 17-under 271.McGrane bogeyed the 17th and ended the day with a 2-under 70, good for a second place at minus-15. Two strokes further back was Jamie Donaldson, who flirted with a possible 59 during a fantastic round but settled instead for an 11-under 61.He shared third place with Robert Coles (67) and Phillip Price (69) at 13-under 275.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, Feb. 13 (UPI) -- As anti-Syrian Lebanese mark the anniversary of the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, allegedly by the pro-Syrian Hezbollah, Hariri's allies still face the threat of assassination as Lebanon remains in the grip of political turmoil.This was underlined by the assassination last October of the head of the Internal Security Forces' intelligence branch, Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, a Hariri protege whose death closely resembled the bomb ambush that blew up Hariri's motorcade of armored limousines in downtown Beirut.But while Hassan was a Hariri stalwart, there are indications his death wasn't necessarily part of the murderous fallout from the events of St. Valentine's Day 2005 but a fragment of a much wider conflict between Sunni and Shiite that Hariri's killing helped propagate.Hariri, a self-made multi-billionaire and five times prime minister, was killed because he'd turned against Syria, which at that time had effectively occupied Lebanon for 29 years.He was killed, along with 22 others, in a massive truck bomb that incinerated his motorcade of identical black Mercedes limos in a massive fireball.Hariri's assassination was followed by a series of attacks, mainly bombings, on anti-Syrian figures, mainly politicians and journalists, in which several were killed.Four others survived. One, Christian TV anchorwoman May Chidiac, lost an arm and a leg.A U.N.-mandated international tribunal, the first to investigate a political killing, initially pointed the finger at Syria, which suited the Americans and the French who were great admirers of Hariri and his post-war reconstruction of Lebanon.Damascus, a longtime practitioner of political assassination, denied the allegations but the killing of its adversaries in Lebanon continued, along with a wave of random terror bombings.Eventually, Hassan's intelligence branch used cellphone records to track down the alleged killers and named four members of Hezbollah, including a top official of its secretive security apparatus.Hezbollah denied involvement and branded the Special Tribunal for Lebanon as a U.S.-Israeli tool to discredit it. Hezbollah, Iran's powerful proxy on Israel's doorstep, has since its beginnings in the mid-1980s been dependent on Syria, Tehran's key Arab ally, as the conduit for its arms supplies and it's highly unlikely it would have carried out such a high-profile assassination on its own initiative.The Hezbollah suspects were indicted by the tribunal, which plans to have a trial at its headquarters in The Hague. Hezbollah refuses to hand over the men.Hassan's assassination in October eliminated a key figure in the Hariri investigation who in August had arrested former Lebanese Cabinet Minister Michel Samaha for smuggling explosives into Lebanon at the behest of Syrian intelligence to attack Syria's opponents.On Feb. 5, Lebanese Judge Riad Abu Ghaida even had the temerity to issue arrest warrants for Brig. Gen. Ali Malmouk, a senior Syrian intelligence officer close to President Bashar Assad, for masterminding the plot.But Hassan's killing was also probably a consequence of his links to Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Directorate. It funds and arms the Sunnis and the ISF against Hezbollah, Iran's ally, in the wider sectarian war between the Sunni monarchy in Riyadh and Tehran.The U.N.-led investigation into Hariri's assassination is pretty much complete. Everyone's waiting for the trial to begin in The Hague.To be sure, other ISF officers had been assassinated before Hassan in what appeared to be a systematic effort to eliminate key figures in the ISF's intelligence branch, which is backed by the Saudis, Americans and the French.One of Hassan's young officers, Capt. Wissam Eid, who traced Hariri's alleged killers through telephone records, was killed in a bombing Jan. 25, 2008, in what widely seen as an act of revenge.His superior, Col. Samir Shehadeh, narrowly escaped death but was crippled in a bombing Sept. 5, 2006.The ISF's intelligence branch is an elite Sunni unit sworn to fight the Shiite Hezbollah, and coreligionists Syria and Iran have infiltrated into the top echelons of the army and military intelligence.But knowledgeable players in Beirut believe Hassan's murder was part of a plot by Syria's president, his back to the wall, to reignite Lebanon's sectarian conflict as a means to ensure his survival."By constantly raising the stakes for all concerned, Assad hopes he can somehow cling to power -- or take everyone down with him," observed international affairs commentator Simon Tisdall.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama Saturday wished everyone Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, and thanked the troops for their service."This month, more than 90,000 people have come through the White House to see the holiday decorations," Michelle Obama said in the weekly radio and Internet address. "And our theme for this year's holiday season was 'Joy to All' -- a reminder to appreciate the many joys of the holidays: the joy of giving, the joy of service, and, of course, the joy of homecomings. ... That's what makes this season so special -- getting to spend time with the people we love most.""And this year, that's especially true for some of our military families," Barack Obama said. "You see, the war in Iraq is over. The transition in Afghanistan is under way. After a decade of war, our heroes are coming home. And all across America, military families are reuniting. So this week let's give thanks for our veterans and their families. And let's say a prayer for all our troops -- especially those in Afghanistan -- who are spending this holiday overseas, risking their lives to defend the freedoms we hold dear," the president said."Our military families sacrifice so much on our behalf, and Barack and I believe that we should serve them as well as they serve this country," the first lady said. "That's why [second lady] Dr. Jill Biden and I started Joining Forces an effort to rally all Americans to honor and support our veterans and military families. Just go to joiningforces.gov to find out how you can show your gratitude for their service.""For my family and millions of Americans, it's a time to celebrate the birth of Christ, to reflect on His life and learn from His example," the president said. "Every year, we commit to love one another. To give of ourselves. To be our brother's keeper. To be our sister's keeper. But those ideas are not just part of our faith. They're part of all faiths. And they unite us as Americans." "In this country, we take care of each other. And in this season of giving, it's inspiring to see so many people all across America taking the time to help those most in need," Michelle Obama said."And this year, I know many of you are extending that kindness to the families who are still picking up the pieces from Hurricane Sandy and your prayers to the people of Newtown, Connecticut. ... And on behalf of my favorite Americans -- Michelle, Malia, Sasha and Bo -- Merry Christmas, everybody," the president said.

MIAMI, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- An artist destroyed a $1 million vase by Ai Weiwei on display in the Perez Art Museum-Miami to draw attention to local artists, police said.Maximo Caminero, a well-known local painter who has shown works at the Fountain Art Fair, faces felony mischief charges after destroying the vase Monday. Caminero said said his action was a display of support for local artists in Miami, the Miami New Times reported Tuesday."I did it for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here," Caminero told the New Times. "They have spent so many millions now on international artists. It's the same political situation over and over again. I've been here for 30 years and it's always the same."The police report indicated a Perez Art Museum-Miami security guard saw Caminero pick up the vase Monday, and she told him to put the artwork down, but instead Caminero "threw and broke the vase on the floor in protest."Caminero then "spontaneously told [police] that he broke the vase in protest of local artists and that the museum only displayed international artists," the police report said.Caminero told New Times he didn't know Weiwei's work was worth $1 million."I didn't know that it was that amount," he said. "I feel so sorry about it, for sure."
