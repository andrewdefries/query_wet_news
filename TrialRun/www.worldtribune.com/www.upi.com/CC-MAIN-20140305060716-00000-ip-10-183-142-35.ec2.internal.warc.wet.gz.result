HAMBURG, Pa., April 22 (UPI) -- A former member of Twisted Sister helped a Pennsylvania high school rock group overturn a ban on electric instruments at their school talent show.Dee Snider, now a disc jockey for WMMR radio, took aim at the Hamburg High School rule on air, WCAU-TV reports. Snider was supporting high school senior Greg Miller Jr., who had already presented the school board with a petition bearing 215 signatures.The board changed their minds, and Miller and his band got to play in all their amplified glory. One number, Twisted Sister's "We're Not Going To Take It," had been selected before they got any help from Snider. Snider showed up for the show Thursday night and joined the band onstage."I had an opportunity, I had a microphone and I could make noise and I could help raise some hell, and why not?" Snider told the TV station.

NEW YORK, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- U.S. men and women practice some of the riskiest sexual behavior in the world, the Durex Sexual Well Being global survey indicates. Kevin Harshaw, marketing director of U.S. personal care at Reckitt Benckiser, a global consumer goods company that includes condom maker Durex, said the survey examined the sexual attitudes and behaviors of more than 29,000 people in 36 different countries. The study indicates 60 percent of U.S. men and women didn't use any form of protection against HIV/AIDS or sexually transmitted infections when they lost their virginity versus 49 percent in Mexico and 47 percent in Columbia. Among those who risked not practicing safer sex, the largest proportion of U.S. men and women -- 49 percent -- say they were confident their sexual partner was free of STIs, although 20 percent of all those in a relationship admit they are unsure of their partner's experience.U.S. men claim to have an average of 20 different sexual partners in total -- versus 27 Canada, 24 in Australia, but more than 19 in France, 17 in Britain or 15 in Mexico. U.S. women say they had 10 partners on average, the same number as women in Britain and France, but more than in Canada at 9 and Italy at 8.The survey was conducted by Harris Interactive online in 35 countries and face to face in Nigeria from Sept. 6 to Oct. 3.

| License Photo	MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- A three-building office complex in Ontario has issued a ban on holiday poinsettias for 6,000 workers due to one employee's allergy.Property manager Nexacor sent out a memo on behalf of Bell Canada explaining workers at the Creekbank campus in Mississauga will not be allowed to keep the traditional plants on their desks due to a worker suffering from an allergy that could be life-threatening, the Toronto Star reported Thursday."Please make sure all personal plants on desks and other office areas are also removed by Dec. 21," the memo read. "Any plants found after Dec. 21 will be removed and disposed of without further notification."Bell spokesman Mark Langton said the allergic employee has been with the company for 30 years.Langton said Nexacor was being "overzealous" with the memo, which said a full plant ban would be enforced. He said such a ban has been in place since the office opened, but has not been enforced because it was mostly aimed at easing the transition into the building.

MOSCOW, Jan. 28 (UPI) -- Russia's Roscosmos federal space agency has announced it would seek government approval to build the world's largest rocket.The planned launcher would be able to lift 80 tons into low Earth orbit, and could be upgraded to launch as much as 160 tons, which would be the heaviest payload every lifted into space by a single rocket, RIA Novosti reported."I think that in the near future, within a month, we will make our suggestions to the Military-Industrial Commission," Roscosmos head Oleg Ostapenko said at an annual space conference in Moscow Tuesday.The current record holder, NASA's Saturn V rocket used to launch Apollo astronauts on their journey to the moon, had a maximum lift capability of 120 tons.Roscosmos formed a working group last year to evaluate proposals for a heavy-lift rocket, including the revival of the Energia launcher, the highest payload rocket ever built in the Russia, which was canceled during an economic crisis 20 years ago.Russia's largest existing rocket, the Proton, can launch payloads of up to 20 tons.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, Feb. 9 (UPI) -- A representative government in Beirut would find it hard to back from an international investigation into the death of one its leaders, a U.S. official said.Lawmakers tied to Shiite resistance movement Hezbollah led opposition leaders in mass resignations that brought down the Western-backed government of Saad Hariri in January.Hezbollah was upset with Hariri's continued support for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is finishing its investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -- Saad Hariri's father -- in 2005.U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Maura Connelly said any new government that emerges from Beirut must respect the work of the tribunal."Any government that claims to be truly representative of all of Lebanon would find it impossible to abandon the tribunal's efforts to end the era of impunity for assassinations in the country," she was quoted by Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper as saying.Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati is moving closer to forming a Cabinet that will likely be dominated by Hezbollah and its allies in the March 8 coalition."The birth of the new government is (coming) in a matter of days, either at the weekend or early next week," a source told the newspaper on condition of anonymity.

FORT PIERCE, Fla., Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Democrat Patrick Murphy's camp declared victory Sunday over Republican Allen West in Florida's 18th Congressional District, based on unofficial results.But West, the first-term incumbent, wasn't conceding and his campaign sought a hearing for further review of the votes, The West Palm Beach Post reported. Murphy staked a claim to victory after the St. Lucie County Canvassing Board missed a noon deadline to finish its partial recount and submit its results to the Division of Elections. His lead had been widening as the recount progressed.WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, reported that after more than 37,000 St. Lucie County ballots were reviewed Canvassing Board member Tod Mowery said Murphy had 65,841 votes to 52,704 for West.While the results have to be certified by the governor and secretary of state, Murphy campaign senior adviser Eric Johnson said the outcome was clearly in Murphy's favor."As far as we're concerned, this puts an end to it," Johnson said. "The West people demanded a recount. They got that retabulation and Patrick Murphy gained a margin of 242 votes."This election is over."Murphy's unofficial lead is greater than the 0.5 percent difference needed to trigger an automatic recount under state law.West's campaign manager, Tim Edson, said the situation was under review."We are still evaluating how to handle this," he said. "It's a unique case."The Post reported Edson said Gov. Rick Scott and Secretary of State Ken Detzner "will have to take a look at these recounts."The Post said as soon as the noon deadline passed, attorneys for West went to the St. Lucie County Courthouse to request an emergency hearing on the issue. It was not known if one was scheduled, the newspaper said.Florida law allows an exemption to the deadline in an emergency and West's attorney are expected to argue that the exemption applies.
