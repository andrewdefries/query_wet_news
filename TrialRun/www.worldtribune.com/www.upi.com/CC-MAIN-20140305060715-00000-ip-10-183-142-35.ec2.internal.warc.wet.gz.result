PARIS, Nov. 5 (UPI) -- Commuters across the globe may be filling their tanks with gasoline processed in China as the country moves to expand its refining capacity, the IEA said.The International Energy Agency expects China to increase its refining capacity by as much as 2.9 million barrels within the next five years. The agency said it expected Chinese demand for oil to drop 1 million barrels per day for 2016 when compared to predictions made two years ago.Antoine Halff, director of the IEA's oil market unit, said in a statement that the global oil map "is being redrawn" and the Chinese economy is playing a large role in that development."The result could be more motorists in more parts of the world filling up with gasoline made in China," he said in a statement.The IEA reported that statements made by PetroChina and others suggest the agency has underestimated the refinery growth potential in China. Any surplus from the country may find its way to the international market.The country, in a deal with Russian oil company Rosneft and state-owned China National Petroleum Corp., has given operators at the planned Tianjin refinery permission to buy and sell oil products for export, the IEA said.

| License Photo	BERLIN, Oct. 24 (UPI) -- People with higher blood sugar levels are more likely to have memory problems, even if they don't have diabetes or high blood sugar, researchers in Germany. Study author Dr. Agnes Floel of Charite University Medicine in Berlin said people with lower blood sugar levels were more likely to have better scores on the memory tests. The study involved 141 people with an average age of 63 who did not have diabetes or pre-diabetes. They were asked to recall a list of 15 words in 30 minutes. People who were overweight, drank more than three-and-a-half servings of alcohol per day, and those who had memory and thinking impairment were not included. Participants also had brain scans to measure the size of the hippocampus area of the brain, which plays an important role in memory.The study, published online in the journal Neurology, found those who recalled fewer words were associated with higher blood sugar levels. In addition, people with higher blood sugar levels also had smaller volumes in the hippocampus. "These results suggest that even for people within the normal range of blood sugar, lowering their blood sugar levels could be a promising strategy for preventing memory problems and cognitive decline as they age," Floel said in a statement. "Strategies such as lowering calorie intake and increasing physical activity should be tested."

SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 5 (UPI) -- A Texas man got a bit too close to a snake when he found one in a toilet in the men's room at a San Antonio Starbucks.The snake, believed to be a harmless rat snake, eventually slithered away, presumably back into the plumbing, CNN reported. Bruce Ahlswede told KSAT-TV, a CNN affiliate in San Antonio, he visited Starbucks Tuesday with his wife after a business presentation. He said when he first saw the snake it was on top of the toilet and he thought it was a toy left as a prank until it began moving. Instead of using the facilities, he went to the manager: "I said 'Hey you've got a snake in your bathroom and she's kind of freaking out.' "Michele Ahlswede, who joined her husband for a look, got a picture that she posted on Facebook. The South Texas Herpetology Association sent some expert help to Starbucks at the store's request, but the snake disappeared first. An expert told KSAT the snake was almost certainly a rat snake, a non-venomous constrictor that is generally harmless to humans.

Keppinger was the last of those, forcing in Dunn to give the White Sox the lead.The Chicago rally gave the victory to Matt Lindstrom (2-2), who worked only a third of an inning in relief of starter Jose Quintana.Addison Reed turned in a perfect ninth for his 13th save.

BRUSSELS, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Belgium has reduced its terror precautions due to lowered threat levels but is still closely watching some key locales, Interior Minister Joelle Milquet says.Milquet, responding to criticism from the center-left Reformist Movement over the move, said the government is confident tight security measures introduced at Belgian international railway stations Aug. 5 could be safely reduced.Security was stepped up in the wake of the closure of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa following the interception of intelligence that al-Qaida was planning a major terrorist attack against U.S. and Western targets.The security measures were eased Friday.Milquet said the move was justified by a downward revaluation of the terrorist threat by the Coordinating Body for Threat Analysis but added security had nevertheless been strengthened in some "strategic locations until further notice," the Belgian news agency BELGA reported.The statement came only hours after Milquet was challenged by Parliamentarian Denis Ducarme, a member of the French-speaking liberal party the Reformist Movement, which is part of Belgium's governing coalition.Ducarme said he wanted a "reassessment" of the decision to reduce the police presence at the train stations, saying it would be "useful for the interior minister to confirm (with the U.S. National Security Agency) that this exercise is quite justified."I'm surprised we have changed tack in just two or three weeks," Ducarme told BELGA, noting that, unlike Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic have decided to step up security measures against terrorism risks.Ducarme also claimed that while security levels at Brussels high-speed train stations were increased, those in the French-speaking southern Wallonia region weren't.Milquet, however, denied any difference in her Tuesday statement."The measures are identical for all lines," she said.Louis Maraite, spokesman for the Belgian national railway operator SNCB, confirmed police presence was being reduced at stations despite a report by the German newspaper Bild that Al-Qaida was planning attacks on high-speed trains in Europe.Maraite said the security situation was returned to normal after consultations with the authorities, the police and Securail, the Belgian railway security force.German authorities, meanwhile, indicated they would monitor lines used by the German high-speed ICE trains and their stations for two weeks, while deploying a series of discrete additional measures, such as plainclothes police officers.Bild reported the attacks could take the form of acts of sabotage on the tracks and tunnels and bombs on trains. The newspaper said the information came from the NSA, which has reportedly intercepted a telephone conversation this month between senior Al-Qaida figures.The report prompted no additional security measures in the neighboring Netherlands, a spokesman for the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security told the Dutch daily De Telegraaf.There is no concrete information that Dutch trains are being targeted, he said, adding, "It's old information, which has been known to us."

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 12 (UPI) -- A Kentucky murder suspect is unable to find a lawyer to represent him at trial because he keeps threatening to kill them, the judge in his case says.The defendant, Percy Brown, denied making the threats and argued with the judge until deputies removed him from the courtroom, The (Louisville, Ky.) Courier Journal reported Monday.Jefferson County Judge McKay Chauvin said Brown's case was an "interesting and unique" situation because the defendant had been through numerous attorneys since being arrested in 2008 in connection with the 2004 shooting death of 19-year-old Jennifer French.Brown won't cooperate with his attorneys and threatens them continuously, the judge said.Prosecutors say Brown previously said he wanted to represent himself but now wants an attorney to serve as co-counsel.Brown's latest attorney, Ander Al-Shami, asked on Monday to be removed as Brown's counsel.He declined to discuss his reasons.Brown told Chauvin he had requested Kentucky Chief Justice John Minton remove the judge from the case.Brown's sister, Vanessa Kelly, declared his innocence, saying he was "not capable" of murder.

PARIS, Aug. 11 (UPI) -- A video taken several months ago shows five Frenchmen kidnapped in North Africa over the past two years alive in captivity. The hostage video was broadcast Friday by Sahara Media in Mauritania, Radio France Internationale reported. Sahara Media said it was made in the last months of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's term. He left office May 15. The men were kidnapped in Mali and Niger, allegedly by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the al-Qaida affiliate in the region. They were shown in the video surrounded by armed men. Phillipe Verdon, a geologist abducted with a colleague in Mali, said on the tape that AQIM is "available to negotiate." He appealed for help winning their release.Verdon said he had been unable to get medication for an unspecified condition for three months. AQIM is holding another group of French hostages, four men abducted in 2010 from a uranium mine in Niger. The al-Qaida group has said they will be released once France pulls out of Afghanistan.

LIMA, Oct. 6 (UPI) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Afghan President Hamid Karzai should thank allied forces "for the sacrifices" they make instead of criticizing them.Panetta's comments Friday came after Karzai said the United States is not doing enough to fight terror in neighboring Pakistan, CNN reported.Karzai accused the United States and NATO Thursday of attacking insurgents in Afghanistan instead of targeting their supporters Pakistan."The U.S. and NATO should go to the places where the roots of terrorism exist. They are saying one thing but acting contrary to that," Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul.Tensions between the United States and Afghanistan have escalated in recent months due to a series of fatal attacks on U.S. troops by their Afghan counterparts, as well as the accidental killing of civilians."Look, we have made progress in Afghanistan because there are men and women in uniform who have been willing to fight and die for Afghanistan's sovereignty," Panetta told reporters shortly after landing in Lima, Peru, Friday for a meeting with Latin American defense officials."Those lives were lost fighting the right enemy not the wrong enemy, and I think it would be helpful if the president, every once in a while, expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan, rather than criticizing them," Panetta said.

Feb. 27 (UPI) -- Justin Timberlake is bringing his dual acting and singing careers into alignment in an upcoming project, the Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis.Timberlake, who has a supporting role in the film that stars Carey Mulligan, teamed up with Mulligan's husband and Mumford & Sons frontman Marcus Mumford for a collaboration on the film's soundtrack."OK I can tell you this: There's a Coen brothers film coming out soon that I was lucky enough to work with Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan," Timberlake told Capital FM. "And coincidentally I did work with Marcus Mumford on the soundtrack, so I became very good friends with them.""Marcus and myself, we all kind of worked on the music together. And I don't know any other world where we would have the opportunity to collaborate like that, but it was so much fun. So not only will that be a great movie, but the music to it will be fantastic." Timberlake returned to making music with "Suit & Tie," his first single since 2007, ahead of the release of a new album, The 20/20 Experience.Mumford, with T Bone Burnett (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Crazy Heart), is producing the soundtrack for Inside Llwelyn Davis, a film about a singer-songwriter in 1960's New York, loosely based on Dave Von Ronck's memoir The Mayor of MacDougal Street.Mumford is coming off a good year, with his group's sophomore album, Babel taking Album of the Year at the Grammys earlier this month.

Seth Benjamin Gesshel Green (born February 8, 1974) is an American actor, comedian, voice actor, and television producer. He is well known for his role as Daniel "Oz" Osbourne in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as well as Dr. Evil's son Scott in the Austin Powers series of comedy films and Mitch Miller in That '70s Show. He also voices the characters of Chris Griffin on Family Guy, Lieutenant Gibbs in Titan Maximum, Systems Alliance Flight Lieutenant Jeff "Joker" Moreau in the 2007 video game Mass Effect and its 2010 sequel Mass Effect 2, and is one of the creators and producers of the stop motion comedy series Robot Chicken, where he voices many characters as well. Green appeared in many other movies, such as Rat Race, The Italian Job, Can't Hardly Wait, as a child in Stephen King's It and as Dan in the 2004 movie Without a Paddle.
Green was born and raised in West Philadelphia, a section of the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents are Barbara (née Gesshel), an artist, and Herb Green, a math teacher. His parents divorced when Seth was 15, causing havoc in his personal life. However, he found refuge in URJ Camp Harlam in Kunkletown, Pennsylvania, where he had been going since he was five years old. His mother worked there for a couple of years as the art director. There he discovered that performing was his true calling. After his parents' divorce, he said that camp was a place where he could reinvent himself and be good at anything he wanted. Green was raised Jewish and played a 1940s Jewish boy in Woody Allen's movie Radio Days; his ancestors were from Poland, Russia and Scotland. In this regard, he said:
Green's first movie role was in the 1984 film A Billion for Boris. At eight, Green landed his first film assignment, a co-starring role in the 1984 film The Hotel New Hampshire with Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe. He appeared in the 1987 film Can't Buy Me Love, playing the part of Patrick Dempsey's little brother, Chuckie Miller. He also starred in Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) as Joe, and appeared in Big Business (1988) and, in the same year, in My Stepmother Is an Alien. Green appeared in the miniseries It (as Richie Tozier, age 12), all three Austin Powers movies as Dr. Evil's son, Scott, and Enemy of the State and The Italian Job as a computer specialist. He was also in the films Can't Hardly Wait, Rat Race, Without a Paddle, Idle Hands and Sex Drive. Green also had a role in the 1992 film Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but the scene he was in was subsequently cut. In 1994, he starred alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt in the short-lived series The Byrds of Paradise. He worked with Hewitt again in 1998's Can't Hardly Wait, which also featured Paige Moss, who would later play with him in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Amber Benson (Tara Maclay, Buffy) was also in this film, but her scenes were cut in order to get a PG-13 rating.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
