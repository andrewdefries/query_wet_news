| License Photo	If you strip away the campaign rhetoric, you'll find that small business owners favor allowing the tax rate cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers to expire to help pay down the U.S. debt, Small Business Majority says. A poll the advocacy organization released last week indicated the majority of small-business owners thinks raising taxes on the top 2 percent of taxpayers is the right thing to do and government can play a role in helping small businesses thrive.The poll and another survey earlier this year, Small Business Majority Founder and Chief Executive Officer John Arensmeyer says "really show that despite the hypersensitive and partisan election environment and the rhetoric bandied about, small business wants government to play a role to create a level playing field."And one way, he said is to allow tax rates for the wealthiest taxpayers enacted during George W. Bush's administration to expire to help address the economic crisis, citing the survey's results indicating 52 percent favored such a path. Thirty-nine percent said raising the tax rate for the wealthy would mean raising taxes on job creators and small business, he said.Small business owners aren't "monolithically ideological" on these issues, seeing a role for government when it's helpful but equally recognize when government intervention isn't warranted."Small-business owners are pragmatic" about when government steps in, he said, not part of an "ideological broad-brush.""That's not the way they view the world," Arensmeyer said.A key argument for keeping the series of tax rate cuts is the claim most small businesses file as individuals and would be impacted by increases to the individual rate -- a claim the organization says its polling shows is misguided.While most respondents -- 54 percent -- report their business income is passed through to their personal taxes, only 5 percent reported having total income of more than $250,000, Small Business Majority said. Based on this finding, the survey said a huge percentage of small-business owners would not be impacted by the expiration of tax cuts on income of more than $250,000 for families.Ann Zimmerman of Cincinnati, who owns an accounting firm and an Internet solutions company, said she would be one of the upper 2 percent who would see their rates return to those in effect when Bill Clinton occupied the White House.The argument against letting high-end tax rates expire is "purely political," Zimmerman said. "I happen to be in the top tax bracket and I'm in favor of letting them expire."The majority of businesses would be unaffected by the expiration, she said. "These are the job creators that can drive the economic recovery," she added.Furthermore, Zimmerman said, "there's no way" she would let her personal tax rate "drive my business decisions."The middle class must get back on track if the economy is going to get back on track, she said, adding she favored keeping the lower tax rates for the middle class.Agreeing with her was small business owner Luke Chung, owner of a software company in Vienna, Va., who argued hiring and investment are based on "profit potential, not tax consideration."Decisions driven by tax policy are "kind of short-sighted," he said.Chung said he thinks the differences between the Bush tax rates and the Clinton tax rates "doesn't matter much" and doesn't "impact my decision-making."Chung, like Zimmerman, expressed concern about the country's economic health and the need to drive down the deficit. But Chung called the top-tier tax rate issue "just a tiny piece" of the overall picture.The National Federation of Independent Businesses, another advocate for small business, said its membership indicated federal and state taxes on business, property taxes and the complexity of the tax laws were among their major concerns."This demonstrates a strong need for tax reform that helps small business owners," the organization said on its website.The organization said tax reform must include reform for individual and corporate tax codes, tax rates on corporate and pass-through businesses (business owners who file through their personal taxes), which should stay equal and low. Additionally, reform should promote economic growth and simplify the tax code "The tax implications of choosing a pass-through entity should play a major role in the tax reform debate," NFIB said. "While most discussions on tax reform are about lowering the corporate tax rate, tax reform should also include lowering the individual tax rate to support pass-through businesses." NFIB has written to Congress on behalf of several pieces of tax-related legislation, noting small businesses, 75 percent of which are organized as pass-through entities, are "disproportionately impacted by any increase in marginal tax rates."In a letter written during the summer to Congress, NFIB said increasing the top tax rates would shrink the economy by 1.3 percent and cost 710,000 jobs.In the Small Business Majority survey, a majority of small business owners said the most important task for Congress and the president next year is to develop a plan to create more jobs.Nine in 10 small business owners surveyed said they favor eliminating tax breaks given for moving production oversees and support providing new incentives for bringing production back to the United States.Seventy-two percent of small business owners said they support eliminating loopholes that favor large corporations. A majority said it would like to see tax breaks for gas and oil companies removed and expressed support for tax incentives that encourage clean-energy investment.Finally, 48 percent of business owners said they were doing OK, 27 said they were doing well or very well and 24 percent said their business is not doing well.Small Business Majority said more of the small-business owners identified themselves as Republicans than Democrats, 47 percent to 35 percent.The telephone poll of 500 small-business owners was conducted Sept. 27-Oct.12. The margin of error is 4.4 percentage points.

TEL AVIV, Israel, April 6 (UPI) -- Israel is seeking $700 million from the United States to fund additional batteries of the Iron Dome counter-rocket system and other air-defense weapons.The Israeli military says the systems are needed to protect the country from massive missile bombardment until 2015.The move comes amid growing concerns in Israel, fueled to a large extent by strident warnings from generals and more recently Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, that the Jewish state is increasingly vulnerable to bombardment by tens of thousands of missiles and rockets held by Iran, Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.All this has emerged as Netanyahu has been forced to reduce Israeli the military budget to boost social spending after months of protests in 2011.At the same time, the U.S. administration has made major cuts in the Pentagon's budget because of economic woes.U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged that Washington won't jeopardize Israel's defense capabilities but at the same time he's been leaning on Netanyahu to hold off any unilateral Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program, which Netanyahu claims is an existential threat to the Jewish state.The feeling in Israel, and quite a few people in Washington as well, is that Netanyahu's seeking to squeeze extra funds out of Obama by exploiting U.S. concerns the Americans will be dragged into another Middle East war if Israel does strike.Israel's Ynet Web site, the online service of the Yediot Ahronot daily, quoted Israeli sources "privy to the deal" as saying the two sides are discussing the proposed aid package.Indeed, Ynet acknowledged that "the U.S. Congress and administration's apparent willingness to allocate the funds may be seen as an attempt to incentivize Israel to delay its decision vis-a-vis a military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities."If approved, the requested U.S. funding would allow Israel to build four additional batteries of the Iron Dome system developed by state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and speed up work on another air-defense weapon, David's Sling, also being developed by Rafael.The United States provided $205 million fiscal 2011 to help fund Iron Dome.In March, a bipartisan group introduced the Iron Dome Support Act in Congress authorizing the administration to provide more funds for the system as required by Israel.Obama has said he'll provide "an appropriate level of funding," and that presumably will cover whatever sum the administration decides on in the coming days.Iron Dome, which got its baptism of fire against Palestinian Qassam and Grad rockets in 2011, is designed to intercept short-range rockets and missiles. It's able to down 76 percent of the projectiles it engages.But there are only four batteries, each costing in excess of $50 million, deployed. Military planners say at least 20 are needed to cover all of Israel against short-range missile fire from Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.Three are in the southern Negev Desert facing Palestinian rockets fired from Gaza. The fourth was deployed two weeks ago near Tel Aviv, Israel's largest urban area.Rafael said in March the government has ordered seven units.There have been reports Rafael is seeking to extend the range of Iron Dome's rocket interceptors to 155 miles on the premise that fewer batteries would be needed.David's Sling is intended to counter missiles with a range of up to 70 miles as well as cruise missiles.These two systems comprise the lower tiers of a planned four-level missile defense shield.The two top layers will be high-altitude Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 systems developed by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries to counter ballistic missiles such as Iran's Shehab-3b and Sejjil-2 and Syria's Soviet-designed Scud-C and M600 weapons.Arrow-3, under development by IAI and Boeing, is designed to intercept such missiles at long-range beyond Earth's atmosphere.The entire Arrow program has been largely funded by the Americans since the 1990s.For now, the primary concern is to rush as many batteries of Iron Dome into operational deployment as fast as possible.The firing of three Grad rockets at the southern resort city of Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba from the Sinai Peninsula at late Wednesday opened up a new threat.It wasn't clear who unleashed the rockets but Palestinian fire has until now come from the Gaza Strip further north on the Mediterranean.

HOLLYWOOD, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- A ballistics test will provide a clue in the slaying of a Hollywood movie publicist, police said.Harold Martin Smith killed himself Friday when officers from the Hollywood Police Department attempted to question him about the death of Ronni Chasen, the Los Angeles Times reported.A ballistics test will reveal if the gun Martin used to kill himself was used in Chasen's death."At this time, it is unknown if this individual was involved in the Chasen homicide," department spokesman Lt. Tony Lee said.Chasen was shot to death in her Mercedes-Benz on Nov. 16 as she drove home from a premiere party for the movie "Burlesque."Three days later, the crime was featured on the television show "America's Most Wanted," and the show received a tip about a man claiming knowledge of her death."He said, 'I think I know this guy. Someone has been bragging about it or talking about it and this is a dangerous guy and I'm afraid,'" the show's host, John Walsh, said.But the caller hung up without providing further details."We begged the guy to call back," Walsh said.He called back a few days later, and said Smith was expected to visit an apartment building where he had once lived.Police followed up on the lead and when they approached Martin, he pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head.

IN YOUR DREAMS, GUYSIs Britney Spears available? A Date.com poll finds dinner or a sports event top the list of men's dream first date with the pop princess.And almost all would ask her back to their place -- whether or not the date went well or not.With Spears maybe or maybe not on the outs with long-time beau Justin Timberlake (she says not), where would men take her on a date if they had the chance? Online dating Web site Date.com asked 18,421 men that question.The most popular Britney date would be out to dinner -- selected by 45 percent of respondents. Another 21 percent said they would take her to a sporting event, 12 percent to a club, and 9 percent to a movie. Only 8 percent would take Britney to the place where she could best showcase her talent -- karaoke night. Four percent said they would take her to a concert and 1 percent said they would take her shopping.When asked if they would invite the singer "back to your place" after the date, a whopping 88 percent of wishful thinkers said "yes, regardless of how the date went up to that point." A more practical 9 percent said they would invite her back "if the date went well up to that point," and a mere 3 percent said they wouldn't even give it a shot, saying they "would never ask on the first date."BOB, BOB, BOBBLEHEADSPost Cereals has caught Bobblehead fever. For the start of the 2002 baseball season, the company will place more than 16 million Major League Baseball player mini-bobblehead dolls inside specially marked packages of nine Post Cereal brands (Alpha Bits, Cocoa Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles, Golden Crisp, Honey Comb, Marshmallow Alpha Bits, Oreo O's, Post Premium Raisin Bran and Waffle Crisp).The three-inch-tall bobblehead dolls will include Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox; Luis Gonzalez, Arizona Diamondbacks; Jason Giambi and Bernie Williams, NY Yankees; Chipper Jones, Atlanta Braves; Sammy Sosa, Chicago Cubs; Ichiro Suzuki, Seattle Mariners; Jeff Bagwell, Houston Astros; Alex Rodriguez, Texas Rangers; and Mike Piazza, NY Mets.Bobblehead dolls -- which are known for their oversized heads that shake and nod -- have been around since the 1950s but have recently become trendy again.ANIMAL STORYThe dodo bird was essentially an overgrown pigeon, genetic researchers say.The dodo was a large, flightless bird native to an island east of Madagascar that became extinct as a result of the encroachment of humans and accompanying rats and pigs. In the March 1 issue of Science, Beth A. Shapiro, Alan Cooper and their colleagues at the University of Oxford and the Natural History Museum in London reported their comparison of genetic sequences from the dodo, its close relative the solitaire bird, and 37 other species of pigeons and doves. The study showed that the dodo and solitaire are not on the fringe of this group, but fall right in the middle of it genetically. The closest living relatives to the birds are the Nicobar pigeons of Southeast Asia, the crowned pigeons of New Guinea and the toothbilled pigeons of Samoa.The solitaire and dodo probably separated from other pigeons about 42 million years ago, after they emigrated to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. "In an island situation, the birds that put on the most mass, and eat the most, can dominate in terms of mating and territory," Cooper told the New York Times. But being big and flightless made it difficult for them to escape hungry humans.(Thanks to Jim Kling, UPI Science Writer)REASONS TO CELEBRATE TODAY:WEDNESDAY: Today through April 15 is Deaf History Month.

LOS ANGELES, May 6 (UPI) -- Doctors who specialize in delivering babies and treating pregnant women are closing their offices, leaving states such as Nevada and Pennsylvania, or abandoning their profession because they can't get liability insurance -- even at sky high rates. "One New Jersey specialist -- without a legal blemish on his practice record -- was finally able to secure insurance at the cost of $300,000 a year," Dr. Thomas Purdon, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), told United Press International Monday."We are in a crisis situation," Purdon said at the annual meeting of ACOG in Los Angeles, Calif., as organization leaders issued a "Red Alert" -- warning that without relief from state and federal legislation many rural areas of the country will be without obstetricians.Not only are doctors leaving the field, but hospitals are closing their maternity wards, and Purdon said the "ripple effect" is also reaching into academic institutions where recruiting experts to teach obstetrics and gynecology could be hamstrung as well.ACOG leaders cited the states of Florida, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West Virginia as being most in danger of losing obstetric care due to difficulty in getting insurance coverage.For example, in Florida obstetricians have an average cost that exceeds $200,000 a year for insurance premiums if they practice in populous Dade (Miami) and Broward (Fort Lauderdale) counties, said Purdon, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson.In Nevada, Purdon said 70 obstetricians in the Las Vegas-area are about to leave the state due to the withdrawal from the market of one of Nevada's largest liability insurers."In Mississippi, a pregnant woman in Yazoo City which has a population of 14,000 has to travel 150 miles to get prenatal care," Purdon said. "When a woman has to travel that far to get care, she isn't going to get care."One solution, Purdon said, would be creation of national legislation to establish legal reforms such as those in place in California. Those laws impose a cap on non-economic -- that is, pain-and-suffering or punitive -- damages. "Insurance rates in California have remained stable for years there," he said.Purdon said the "Red Alert" was issued to let the public and legislators know there is a crisis that is going to have a severe effect on obstetric care. He said similar crises exist for neurosurgeons and orthopedists and are evidence that "we need to have legal reform. We have to look for better solutions.""Unlike previous crises in the 1970s and 1980s," said Dr. Albert Strunk, an administrative vice president for Washington, DC-based ACOG, "where cost was the issue, this time around there's the obstacle of finding any insurance coverage at all.""When you enter the field of obstetrics and gynecology, you have to love what you do with a passion," said Dr. Charles Hammond, president-elect of ACOG and chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., "because the liability threat will always be there, no matter how outstanding the care you provide."Purdon said the New Jersey doctor he cited had left Eastern Pennsylvania because insurance was not available. Re-establishing his office in New Jersey, the doctor searched for 90 days before he could find insurance liability coverage -- at $300,000 a year. That kind of liability insurance means the doctor "has to pay about $1,000 a day before he can even turn on the lights in his office and doesn't reflect what it costs for paying his nurses and rent," Purdon said. "A lot of doctors are finding that these types of expenses make it difficult to stay in business."Hammond noted that 15 years have passed since the Washington-based Institute of Medicine warned that high liability costs were compromising delivery of obstetric care. "We still need reform at the federal and state levels," he said. "Band-Aid solutions won't work."

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 24 (UPI) -- Boston will try to record its 20th straight victory when it faces the Los Angeles Lakers on Christmas Day.It will be the first time the NBA's most colorful franchises have met since the Celtics pounded the Lakers, 131-92, in Game 6 of last season's NBA Finals in June.In the interim, the Celtics have compiled a 27-2 record, the best start to an NBA regular season.Their 110-91 win over Philadelphia Tuesday made them one victory better than both the 1966-67 76ers and 1969-70 New York Knicks."Unless you win it all, it's pretty much just steam in the air," forward Kevin Garnett told The Boston Globe after Tuesday's milestone victory. "You see it and then it evaporates."The Lakers lead the Pacific Division with a 23-5 record, and have won seven of their last 10 contests."The only stock we put in this contest is to see where we stand at this moment," Lakers guard Kobe Bryant told the LA Daily News.

| License Photo	WARSAW, Poland, March 30 (UPI) -- Polish political icon Lech Walesa said Monday he's ready to give back his medals and emigrate for good because of a new book accusing him of being a communist.Walesa said in his blog the book amounts to a "barbarian libel" and attempts to revise his life history, Polish Radio reports.Walesa, who headed the Solidarity uprising that led to the end of Poland's communist government, expressed outrage over a new book that accuses him of being an informer for the communist-era secret police."Proper authorities should get down to some serious work to resolve the problem of slander," Walesa told Polska Daily. "It is intolerable that a man so highly merited for his contribution to democracy as I am is regarded with such contempt."Walesa said he would leave the country as a last resort if he does not get satisfaction through the courts. In the interim, he said he would refuse to participate in any commemorative events and give back his medals and honors.

| License Photo	CHESTERFIELD, Mo., Sept. 19 (UPI) -- A new Missouri group is attempting to convince female voters U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin is on their side despite of his controversial remarks about rape.Women Standing With Todd Akin held an event Tuesday to dramatize the point, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Several hundred women joined Akin and a lineup of speakers in a hotel ballroom in Chesterfield.Akin, who is challenging Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., made national headlines recently when he suggested women who were victims of "legitimate" rape were unlikely to become pregnant, giving that as a reason for banning abortion for rape victims. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other GOP leaders urged him to step aside for another candidate.At Tuesday's meeting, Heather Kesselring of St. Louis said she has known Akin for many years. She said the real war on women "is pornography, it is sex trafficking, it is abortion.""It is time for us to say Todd Akin understands these issues and he is ready to go fight for women," Kesselring said.Akin addressed the group but did not discuss his rape remarks. He spoke about his mother and read a poem and refused to answer reporters' questions later.Phyllis Schlafly, the longtime conservative activist, had harsh words for Republicans as well as Democrats."He's got a tough race ahead of him because some people who think they know better decided they're not going to give him any money," she said of Akin.

He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The identity of the woman, who is active-duty Army and teaches at the school, has not been released, but she is in stable condition at San Antonio Medical Center.video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player

May 29 (UPI) -- Having already tested the "Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger" in several markets, Wendy's is likely to debut its premium-priced burger option nationwide this fall, BurgerBusiness.com reported this week. The idea of putting a bacon cheeseburger on a dense pretzel bun is part of the food company's plan to focus on more varied bread options, from flatbreads to artisan buns, Columbus Business First reported last year.“Five-star breads at a three-star price,” Gerard Lewis, Wendy's senior vice president of culinary innovation, told the paper. Early testing on the pretzel bun has investors excited about Wendy's Co. stock. Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Mark Kalinowski said that the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger has tested as well as "any Wendy's test items from the last 20 years."But some analysts urge caution.“My immediate reaction would be don’t bet on the bun,” one told Nation's Restaurant News. “It’s all about the beef, so I’m not so sure a pretzel bun introduction is going to be as big an impact as would be necessary for someone to make an advised, intelligent decision about buying their stock.”

Jean Reno (French pronunciation: ; born July 30, 1948) is a French actor. Working in French, English, Spanish and Italian, he has appeared not only in numerous successful Hollywood productions such as The Pink Panther, Godzilla, The Da Vinci Code, Mission: Impossible, Ronin and Couples Retreat, but also in European productions such as the French films Les Visiteurs (1993), it's sequel Les Visiteurs 2 (1998) and Léon (1994) along with the 2005 Italian film The Tiger and the Snow.
Reno was born Juan Moreno y Herrera-Jiménez in Casablanca, Morocco. His Spanish parents were natives of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and Jerez de la Frontera (Spain), and had moved to North Africa to find work and escape the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. His father was a linotypist. His mother died when he was a teenager, and he has a younger sister called María Teresa ("Maite"). Reno was raised Catholic. He moved to France at the age of seventeen and studied acting in the Cours Simon School of Drama.
Due to his tall, hulking frame (188 cm, 6′2″), he mostly played villainous brutes early on in his career. He later appeared in romantic-comedies and action films. Reno's career began in French cinema, where he appeared in many of Luc Besson's films, including Besson's first film, L'Avant dernier. The two have continued to work together throughout their careers, in films produced, written or directed by Besson. Of the films they have done together, the ones that have achieved the most critical and commercial success include: Nikita (1990), the English-language films The Big Blue (1988), and Léon (1994) (known as The Professional in the United States). Additionally, Reno did the voice-over for Mufasa in the French-language version of The Lion King, a role originally performed by James Earl Jones.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
