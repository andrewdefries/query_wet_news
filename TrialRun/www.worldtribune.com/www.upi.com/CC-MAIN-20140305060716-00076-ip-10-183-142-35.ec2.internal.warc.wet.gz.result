PARIS, Nov. 7 (UPI) -- The French government said it would reduce its payroll tax paid by businesses to stimulate industrial growth.The cuts would total 20 billion euros, or $25.6 billion, over three years.The socialist government led by President Francois Hollande said it would make up the difference in revenue with a sales taxes increase and spending cuts that have yet to be announced, The New York Times reported Wednesday.French ministers agreed to the tax cuts in response to a report by Louis Gallois, the former chief executive officer of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, that also recommended a payroll tax reduction for employees, which the government rejected.The report recommended a "competitiveness shock" to the French economy, which has shed 750,000 industrial jobs in the past decade, the Times reported.The deal breaks Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault's pledge, which he made in September, not to raise sales taxes.The sales tax, called a value-added tax in Europe, is considered harder on the poor than the rich, because the poor spend a larger portion of their income.To make up some of the difference, the sales tax is set up in three separate categories.The sales tax for food and other basic needs will drop from 5.5 percent to 5 percent, but the sales tax for most items will rise from 19.6 percent to 20 percent in January 2014.There is also an "intermediate" value added tax in France that covers items such as home repairs and restaurant meals. That tax will rise from 7 percent to 10 percent.

| License Photo	STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- A paternity test has proven U.S. tabloid fixture Michael Lohan is the father of 17-year-old Ashley Horn.Lohan learned the result of the test on Thursday's edition of TV's "Trisha Goddard" chat show.Kristi Horn has long named Lohan as the biological father of her daughter. Lohan was married to Dina Lohan from 1985 to 2007, but they separated several times. They have four children, including troubled actress Lindsay and aspiring model Ali.Michael and Lindsay have been in the news in recent years for their family disputes, substance abuse issues and brushes with the law. Michael met Ashley for the first time on the TV program.When Goddard asked who wanted to open the DNA results envelope, Ashley volunteered, saying, "I'll do it; it's my life," to which Michael added, "It's all of our lives."Kristi cried as she read the result, while Ashley remained silent. Goddard looked at the paper and announced, "Michael is Ashley's father."Ashley then handed the envelope to Michael and said, "Just to prove to you." Michael responded by saying, "I believe what you said."Kristi then told Michael, "You have another daughter and you missed out on 17 years of her life."Michael attempted to hug Ashley, but she resisted, explaining, "This is the first time I've met you, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure."

Today is Saturday, Sept. 24, the 267th day of 2005 with 98 to follow. The moon is waning. The morning stars are Mars and Saturn. The evening stars are Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Venus and Pluto.Those born on this date are under the sign of Libra. They include novelist Horace Walpole in 1717; John Marshall, fourth chief justice of the United States, in 1755; French chemist Georges Claude, inventor of the neon lamp, in 1870; novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1896; sports announcer Jim McKay in 1921 (age 84); actors/singers Sheila MacRae in 1923 (age 82) and Anthony Newley in 1931 (age 74); Muppet creator Jim Henson in 1936; singer/photographer Linda Eastman McCartney, wife of former Beatle Paul McCartney, in 1941; actor Gordon Clapp ("NYPD Blue") in 1948 (age 57); comedian Phil Hartman also in 1949; and actor Kevin Sorbo in 1958 (age 47).On this date in history:The Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed by Congress and signed by President George Washington, establishing the Supreme Court of the United States as a tribunal made up of six justices who were to serve on the court until death or retirement. The number of justices became nine in 1869.In 1929, aviator James Doolittle demonstrated the first "blind" takeoff and landing, using only instruments to guide his aircraft.In 1942, as World War II raged, popular bandleader Glenn Miller ended his long-running radio show and announced he was going into the Army.In 1955, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack while vacationing in Colorado.In 1959, President Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev met at Camp David, Md.In 1986, Congress adopted the rose as the national flower.In 1993, in an address at the United Nation, South African black leader Nelson Mandela called for the lifting of remaining international economic sanctions against South Africa.In 1994, it was reported that CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames had exposed 55 secret U.S. and allied operations to the Soviet Union.In 1996, Israel opened a second entrance to a tunnel used by archeologists at the Temple Mount, sacred to Muslims as well as Jews. The action sparked deadly rioting.In 1997, following the slayings of hundreds of civilians in a series of incidents believed linked to upcoming elections and the long though sporadically fought civil war, the military wing of Algeria's principle Islamic opposition group called for a truce and ordered its guerrillas to "stop combat operations."In 1998, Iran's foreign minister announced that Iran had dropped its 1989 call for the death of Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses" which many Muslims found blasphemous.In 2002, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 189.02 points and closed at 7,683.13, its lowest standing since October 1998.Also in 2002, armed assailants killed 29 people and wounded 75 in an attack on a Hindu temple in Gandhinagar, India.In 2003, a Gallup poll indicated that 67 percent of Baghdad residents believe that the removal of Saddam Hussein was worth the hardships they have endured.In 2004, two Egyptians were seized by gunmen in Baghdad, the third kidnapping of foreigners in the city this month.A thought for the day: Russian-born American novelist and screenwriter Ayn Rand said, "Disunity, that's the trouble. It's my absolute opinion that in our complex industrial society, no business enterprise can succeed without sharing the burden of the problem with other enterprises."

MOSCOW, June 25 (UPI) -- A Russian scientist has dismissed as "nonsense" a rating of academic research by a prestigious journal that ranked his academy 193rd among 200 institutions.Geologist Nikolai Lavyorov of the Russian Academy of Sciences blasted the rankings released last week by the journal Nature."I'm absolutely convinced it's nonsense, since Russian science is a world leader in many spheres [of research]," Lavyorov told RIA Novosti, citing the space industry, nuclear technology and Arctic research as examples.The Nature ranking was based on the number of primary researcher papers published in Nature magazine and its 17 subsidiary publications in 2012.The Russian Academy of Sciences, with 21 publications, was near the bottom of the list.Buts its poor rating is an "artificially exaggerated situation," Lavyorov said.Russia is doing enough research, he said, but was not making enough effort to promote its research in the English-speaking world.

| License Photo	BOSTON, Oct. 4 (UPI) -- The Boston Red Sox fired Manager Bobby Valentine Thursday after a one-year tenure in which he led the team to a last-place finish in the American League East.Boston lost its last eight games, including getting swept in a season-ending three-game series by its archival New York Yankees, and ended with a 69-93 record. Only two AL teams had worse records."Our 2012 season was disappointing for many reasons," said Red Sox General Manager Ben Cherington. "No single issue is the reason and no single individual is to blame. We've been making personnel changes since August, and we will continue to do so as we build a contending club."With a historic number of injuries, Bobby was dealt a difficult hand. He did the best he could under seriously adverse circumstances and I am thankful to him."Valentine, 62, was introduced as the team's manager last December. He'd previously managed the Texas Rangers (1985-92) and New York Mets (1996-2002), leading the Mets to National League pennant in 2000, when the New York Yankees beat the Mets four games-to-one in the World Series.Valentine also had two stints leading Japan's Chiba Lotte Marines.Counting the 2012 record with the Red Sox, Valentine has a major-league managerial record of 1,186-1,165.The Red Sox dismissed Manager Terry Francona last year after the team suffered through a monumental September collapse.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 7 (UPI) -- The FBI said an explosive device that was removed from a U.S.-bound passenger jet before it could be detonated "never presented a threat to public safety."U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal the device was to have been used in a suicide attack by al-Qaida's Yemeni branch, in an upgraded version of the failed underwear bomb incident over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009."There was a terrorist explosive device recovered," a U.S. counterterrorism official told the Journal. "It was intended for use by a suicide bomber on an airline."A U.S. official told CNN al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was responsible for the plot."We believe AQAP produced the device, and we believe it was intended to be used by a suicide bomber on an aircraft," the official said. "The device and the plot are consistent with what we know about AQAP's plans, intentions, and capabilities. They remain committed to striking targets in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the Homeland, and Europe."No arrests were reported and there was no indication as to when or where the device was retrieved.Senior Yemeni officials disavowed any knowledge of the suicide plot, though they stopped short of denying the account from U.S. authorities, the Yemen Post reported. Officials the newspaper contacted in Yemen's Interior, Defense Ministry, presidential office and prime minister's office said they had no information about the case.President Barack Obama has been updated regularly since being informed of the plot in April, the White House said Monday."While the president was assured that the device did not pose a threat to the public, he directed the Department of Homeland Security and law enforcement and intelligence agencies to take whatever steps necessary to guard against this type of attack," National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said."The disruption of this IED [improvised explosive device] plot underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad."The FBI said the device was being analyzed and the Journal said officials described it as "very similar" to devices used previously by Yemeni al-Qaida operatives."The device never presented a threat to public safety, and the U.S. government is working closely with international partners to address associated concerns with the device," an FBI statement said.Homeland Security Department spokesman Matt Chandler issued a statement saying the department was monitoring efforts by terrorist groups intent on attacking the United States, but had "no specific, credible information" about an active plot "at this time," CNN reported."Since this IED demonstrates our adversaries' interest in targeting the aviation sector, DHS continues, at the direction of the president, to employ a risk-based, layered approach to ensure the security of the traveling public," the statement said."These layers include threat and vulnerability analysis, pre-screening and screening of passengers, using the best available technology, random searches at airports, federal air marshal coverage and additional security measures both seen and unseen.""DHS will continue to work with our federal, state, local, international and private sector partners to identify potential threats and take appropriate protective measures. As always, we encourage law enforcement and security officials, as well as the general public, to maintain vigilance and report suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities."

SAN DIEGO, Aug. 1 (UPI) -- A taxpayer association in San Diego asked Mayor Bob Filner to reimburse the city $21,244 it paid for two police officers to accompany him on a trip to Paris.The 70-year-old Democrat traveled in June to Paris to speak at the National Council of Resistance of Iran, taking with him two police officers who served as security.Filner released a statement Wednesday saying he would reimburse the Organization of Iranian-American Communities the nearly $10,000 they paid in travel expenses to have him speak at the event. Under law, the organization would have been allowed to pay the expenses as a non-profit, but it doesn't have non-profit status with the Internal Revenue Service.Now Felipe Monroig, president of the San Diego County Taxpayers Association, is calling on Filner to also reimburse the city for the money it paid for his security detail, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday."It's clear the mayor's trip was little more than a vacation," Monroig said.The Paris trip controversy comes just days after the San Diego City Council voted to file suit against Filner to hold him liable for damages in sexual harassment suits against him. City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said he would have to reimburse the city for attorney fees.

AUCKLAND, New Zealand, June 17 (UPI) -- A young Brit was in satisfactory condition Monday after surviving a 13-story fall from an apartment building in New Zealand, a hospital spokeswoman said.Tom Stilwell, 20, fell from the 15th story of a building in Auckland Sunday while trying to lower himself into the apartment where he was staying from the one above because he was locked out, The New Zealand Herald reported. He fell about 13 stories onto the roof of an adjacent building, the newspaper said.Stilwell was expected to be transferred out of intensive care where he was being treated for neck and back fractures, a broken wrist and suspected internal injuries, his friend, Dave Thomas, told the Herald."He's absolutely fine ... . He's a very lucky man," Thomas said.An Auckland City Hospital spokeswoman said his condition had improved overnight and he was "satisfactory."Stilwell had been out drinking and found himself locked out of his apartment after being separated from his friends.He woke up Geraldine Bautista, 28, who lived in the unit above his and asked if he could lower himself down. She said he quickly climbed over the balcony railing."He never said anything ... . I grabbed his hand and then at that time ... he fell down," she said. "I thought I was dreaming. It happened so fast. It happened within seconds. I couldn't even scream for help. He was like a paper falling from here."

Gay rights advocates slammed the A&E reality star for his remarks comparing homosexuality to bestiality. Posted By Kate Stanton | Dec. 18, 2013 at 8:16 PM | 0 comments

Dec. 18 (UPI) -- Phil Robertson's anti-gay comments appear to have cost him his second job starring on A&E's enormously successful reality show, Duck Dynasty.Robertson, who began a successful business making duck calls for hunters, railed against homosexuality in a recent interview with GQ, calling "homosexual behavior" a sin. On Wednesday, A&E suspended Robertson from the show "indefinitely.""We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson’s comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty," the network said in a statement. "His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely.”“We’re Bible-thumpers who just happened to end up on television,” Robertson said in the interview.Asked what he considered sinful, Robertson said: “Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men." “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers -- they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right," he added, referencing Corinthians. "It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus," he said. "That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying?"Robertson's comments were immediately condemned by gay rights groups, including GLAAD."Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe," GLAAD rep Wilson Cruz said. "He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans -- and Americans -- who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. Phil's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need to re-examine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families." Robertson responded with a statement calling himself "a product of the '60s." I centered my life around sex, drugs and rock and roll until I hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Savior. My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together. However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.[Entertainment Weekly,
