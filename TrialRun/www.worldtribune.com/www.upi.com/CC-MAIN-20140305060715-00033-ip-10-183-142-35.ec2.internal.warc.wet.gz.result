BETHESDA, Md., Feb. 12 (UPI) -- Researchers writing in a U.S. biology journal say Achilles tendon injuries can be sports career killers because the tendon doesn't repair itself."Tendon injury is a very common disease, which hinders many people from enjoying the numerous benefits of sports and recreational activities," Katja Heinemeier from the Institute of Sports Medicine at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark said.Heinemeier and colleagues, writing in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal, said they made the finding about tendon tissue by taking advantage of carbon-14 spikes resulting from post-WWII nuclear bomb tests. A study of Achilles tendons from people who had lived during the period found the high carbon-14 levels of the time had remained in the tendon tissue decades later.That finding suggests the rate of tissue renewal is extremely slow in the tendon if it exists at all, the researchers said.In fact, the results showed the Achilles tendon stays the same after adulthood is reached and growing ends, they said."While the nation waits to see if another Olympic skier or NFL rookie recovers from serious tendon or ligament damage, this report serves as a cautionary tale to temper expectations," said Gerald Weissmann, editor in chief of the FASEB Journal."When it comes to our tendons, what we have may be all we have. Like our teeth, it's far better and less painful in the long term to protect them throughout your lifetime than it is to count on a successful recovery."

Oklahoma City win streak reaches a dozenATLANTA, Dec. 19 (UPI) -- A huge game from Kevin Durant Wednesday carried Oklahoma City to its 12th consecutive victory, 100-92 over Atlanta.Oklahoma City has not lost in the month of December, its last setback having come on Nov. 23 in Boston. The Thunder have captured 15 of their last 16.Durant scored a season-best 41 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, hitting 14-of-24 shots from the field. Russell Westbrook added 27 points with 11 assists. Serge Ibaka added 14 rebounds for the Thunder, who missed only one of their 20 free throw attempts.Josh Teague led Atlanta with 19 points and Josh Smith had 17 points to go with 12 rebounds.Oklahoma City led by as many as 17 points in the third period and then held off an Atlanta charge that saw the Hawks close within five midway through the final quarter. Duke backs up inherited No. 1 rankingDURHAM, N.C., Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Seth Curry helped No. 1 Duke overcome a slow start Wednesday and the Blue Devils eventually ran away from Cornell 88-47.It was the first game for Duke since it assumed the top spot in the national rankings and the Blue Devils (10-0) remained one of eight unbeaten teams in major college basketball.Duke led by only four points inside the 4-minute mark of the first half, but the Blue Devils held Cornell scoreless for the final 1:43 of the opening period and for the first 6:26 of the second.Duke scored 23 points in that stretch and Curry finished with 20. He made three of the Blue Devils' seven 3-pointers and his 7-of-10 from the field paced Duke to a 53 percent shooting night.Mason Plumlee added 18 points for Duke and Rasheed Sulaimon had 16.Shonn Miller tallied 12 points for Cornell (4-7), which turned the ball over 25 times and made only 1-of-10 from beyond the arc.Yanks, Ichiro Suzuki agree on 2-year dealNEW YORK, Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Ten-time all-star outfielder Ichiro Suzuki has agreed to a two-year contract with the New York Yankees, the team announced Wednesday.Terms of the deal weren't revealed, but various reports pegged it at $13 million.Suzuki, who has 2,606 career hits and lifetime .322 batting average over 12 major-league seasons, came to Yankees from the Seattle Mariners in a July 23 trade.He compiled a .322 average with five homers and 27 RBI in 67 games for New York.For the entire 2012 season, Suzuki posted a .283 mark with 28 doubles, six triples, nine home runs, 55 RBI and 29 stolen bases over 162 contests."The Yankees are the kind of team that I always envisioned being a part of," the Japanese star said. "Everyone in the world of competition has a strong desire to win, but the Yankees also have an atmosphere where losing is not an option."Redskins' Griffin feels 'good' in practiceASHBURN, Va., Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Washington Redskins rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III took part in a full practice Wednesday while on the mend from a sprained knee ligament.Griffin was only partially active in previous practices this week after being held out of Sunday's 38-21 win over the Cleveland Browns -- the Redskins' fifth straight win.Fellow rookie Kirk Cousins filled in for him and tossed for 329 yards and two touchdowns in his first NFL start, which elevated Washington into a three-way tie with Dallas and the New York Giants atop the NFC East.Griffin told reporters his knee felt "really good" during the Wednesday workout."What doctors will do is they'll evaluate him tomorrow [Thursday], and hopefully there's no setback, no swelling with the knee," Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan added. "He'll be evaluated through the week, and if the doctors tell me the [ligament] is ready to go, I'll announce him as ready to go."

DENVER, June 1 (UPI) -- A Colorado man accused of sending an envelope with white powder in it to the state Revenue Department could wind up in federal prison, authorities say.The U.S. Attorney's Office said Wednesday agents arrested Matthew O'Neill Tuesday and booked the 51-year-old Kremmling man on federal charges, including perpetrating a hoax related to a terrorism offense, The Denver Post reported.O'Neill, who owes $15,000 in back taxes for 2006 and 2007, allegedly mailed a manila envelope to the state Revenue Department. A staff member working on his tax case said a white powder fell out when the envelope was opened, court documents said. The May 25 incident prompted the evacuation of more than 500 workers from the building.A hazardous materials team later found the substance to be baking soda. But if convicted, O'Neill faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

PHOENIX, March 7 (UPI) -- Jodi Arias, charged with the murder of her boyfriend in his Phoenix-area home, responded to more than 150 questions from the jury Wednesday. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens said she read about two-thirds of the total submitted by jurors and accepted by the judge, prosecution and defense as appropriate, The Arizona Republic reported. Arizona is one of a few states that allows the jury to put questions to witnesses. Jurors with questions submit them on a form and they are read to witnesses once both sides have finished questioning them. Arias, 32, says she was defending herself when she stabbed and shot Travis Alexander, 30, in 2008. Alexander's body was found in the shower in his house in Mesa with a cut throat, a bullet in his head and 27 stab wounds. During 17 days on the witness stand, Arias described a relationship that was abusive. She gave lurid details about her sexual relationship with Alexander. The jury questions suggested many of those who will decide on her guilt are dubious about her story. Jurors asked why she stayed in an abusive relationship and whether the fight she had with her boyfriend just before his death was different from others. They also queried her story that she was in a "fog" during the killing and asked if she had been paid for interviews she gave from jail. Arias could face the death penalty if she is convicted.

BAGHDAD, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- A suicide bomber killed at least 27 Shiite pilgrims Thursday at a bus station in Iraq.The blast targeted pilgrims returning from Karbala, CNN reported. The bomb exploded in Musayyib, a city south of Baghdad. The Financial Times put the death toll at 27. The newspaper said the bombing followed days of increased tensions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, including large demonstrations by Sunnis against the Shiite-dominated government.A few hours before the bomb went off, officials announced they would meet one demand by freeing 11 women from prison and transferring others to facilities in their home provinces. But the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has also threatened to use force against protesters.

Michael Dalgan Lyons (1 November 1910 – 19 November 1991) was an Irish Fine Gael party politician from Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.
A farmer and former employee of the Irish Sugar Company, he stood unsuccessfully as a Fine Gael candidate for Dáil Éireann in the Mayo South constituency at three successive general elections (1954, 1957, and 1961) before finally winning the seat at the 1965 general election to the 18th Dáil. He served only one term in the Dáil, losing his seat at the 1969 general election.
Lyons did not stand for the Dáil again, but after his 1969 defeat he was elected to the 12th Seanad on the Oireachtas sub-panel of the Labour Panel. He was re-elected in 1973 to the 13th Seanad and in 1977 to the 14th Seanad, but did not contest the 1981 Seanad election.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Randy Gardner (born December 2, 1958 in Los Angeles, California) is an American pair skater. With partner Tai Babilonia, he is the 1979 World Champion and the 1976-1980 U.S. national champion.
Babilonia & Gardner began skating together as children, when Babilonia was eight and Gardner ten. Their coach was John Nicks. The pair were five-time gold medalists at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships and won the gold medal at the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships. They were medal favorites at the 1980 Olympics but were forced to withdraw due to an injury to Gardner.
Gardner revealed that he is gay in a 2006 interview with Scene magazine. As an adult he discovered that he was adopted after a relative divulged the family secret and he subsequently tracked down his birth mother, with whom he developed a relationship. He indicated that he was working on his autobiography which to be released at the end of 2008, but there is no indication anywhere that it was ever published.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
