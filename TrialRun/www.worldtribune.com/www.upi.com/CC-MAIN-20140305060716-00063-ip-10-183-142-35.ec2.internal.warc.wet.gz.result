| License Photo	Who would have predicted it? The government's bailout of General Motors has become a hot political issue in the run up to the fall presidential election.Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who opposed federal loans to GM and Chrysler, said he'd sell the Treasury's 26 percent stake in GM quickly if he wins office in November."There is no reason for the government to continue to hold (GM shares), said Romney, son of late Michigan Gov. George Romney. The elder Romney ran American Motors Corp. in the late 1950s and early '60s before entering politics.Romney's dad also made a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 1968 and served as Richard Nixon's first secretary of Housing and Urban Development.Romney said the only reason the government is holding on to its GM shares is to avoid an embarrassing news story about another loss. But last month an assistant Treasury secretary told The Detroit News there was no timetable for selling the GM stock because the administration had to "balance maximizing recovery for the taxpayers with the speed of exit."Treasury has never planned to remain in the auto business, but with GM shares trading at $21.85 on Friday the government would lose about $16 billion if it sold its shares now.Taxpayers pumped $49.5 billion into GM to save the company and hundreds of thousands of jobs around time Romney wrote a 2008 op-ed piece The New York Times titled "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt." In fairness to Romney, his title of his guest editorial was "The Way Forward for the Auto Industry." A Times editor changed the headline but the piece itself was not changed."My own view is that the auto companies needed to go through bankruptcy before government help," Romney said during an interview with WEWS-TV, Cleveland, after an Ohio campaign event in May. "And frankly, that's finally what the president did. He finally took them through bankruptcy." Facing one of the worst economic meltdowns in U.S. history, with capital credit markets contracting and some financial institutions on the verge of collapse, the government provided financing to help GM and Chrysler. The Bush administration wrote the first checks. Chrysler has since repaid its government loans and is now posting record sales, making Romney's recent bid to take credit for the industry's rebound a pretty hard sell."The last time Governor Romney weighed in on the future of the auto industry, it was to suggest we let Detroit go bankrupt, a betrayal no Michigander is likely to forget," Obama campaign spokesman Matt McGrath told The Detroit News. "As someone who was dead wrong about the industry's present, Mitt Romney is the last person who should be offering advice about its future."Romney accused Democrats of "distorting" his position."If they needed help coming out of bankruptcy and government support, that was fine, but I was not in favor of the government writing billions of dollars in checks prior to them going into bankruptcy," Romney said .Romney also said he wants to end federal loans and guarantees to help private companies develop alternative energy."The government is now picking winners and losers -- or in the case of this president -- it's picking losers and private sector does a much better job," Romney said in a Detroit News interview. "The reality is that Solyndra [a bankrupt solar panel maker in California] received [$535 million] funding through a Department of Energy program created [by Congress] under the Bush Administration -- a program that has supported tens of thousands of jobs across the country and is moving forward with investments in innovative projects like the first nuclear plant built in the U.S. in decades and the world's largest wind farm," an Obama campaign spokeswoman told the News. Ford's new F-150Ford's top-selling U.S. vehicle, the full-size F-150 pickup, is getting a facelift.Ford used a Texas meeting of the Future Farmers of America to introduce the 2013 F-150, which looks good hauling cargo or taking the family around town. The refreshed F-150 sports a beefier grill, optional high-intensity headlamps and the latest MyFordTouch voice navigation, entertainment and climate controls."Farm families have always represented an important F-Series truck constituency," said Ford Truck marketing manager Doug Scott. "For these multitasking customers, a Ford pickup means family transportation, economic livelihood, rugged capability and reliability."There will even be a luxury-oriented F-150 Limited.Full-size trucks make up about 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States and Ford will face tough competition from the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, which are both being redesigned for 2013, and the new V6 Dodge Ram.Honda Fit EV electric mileage champion The all-electric Mitsubishi i EV, which gets the impressive electrical equivalent of 112 miles per gallon, has been dethroned by the new Honda Fit EV.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- in its latest fuel efficiency ratings -- estimates the plug-in 2013 electric Fit EV gets 118 MPGe. MPGe is the EPA's mile-per-gallon equivalency rating for electric vehicles.A front-wheel drive Fit EV has a 20 kilowatt lithium-ion battery pack powering a 92 kilowatt electric motor producing 123 horsepower and 188 foot-pounds of torque.The five-passenger Fit EV can go as many as 82 miles on a single charge in combined city/highway driving, better than the all-electric Nissan Leaf's 73 miles per charge combined range and the Mitsubishi i's 62 miles per charge.The plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt can go 35 miles on electric power before its gasoline engine takes over to recharge the battery for the next 250 miles. Minor battery changes will boost that to 38 miles on electric power in 2013 models. GM says it sold more than 7,000 Volts from January through May, nearly as many as it sold in all of last year.Nissan sold 2,613 Leafs through May.The EPA estimates it would cost about $500 a year to power the Fit EV and Honda said its batteries can be recharged in as little as three hours when connected to a 240-watt charging station.With a manufacturers' suggested retail price of $36,625, Honda said the Fit EV will be available for lease for $399 a month this year in California and Oregon. A wider roll-out is expected next year.In other gas-sipper news, Consumer Reports recently drove a Honda Civic HF, the Chevrolet Cruze Eco and the Ford Focus SFE, and concluded small cars with special "eco" packages don't improve mileage enough to justify the added expense.An "eco" vehicle has special systems, like low-rolling resistance tires, to maximize fuel economy and can cost $500 to $800 more than its conventional gasoline engine sibling. Consumer Reports said a Focus SFE would save owners about $145 in gas a year over a standard Focus, the Civic HF $135 annually over a conventional Civic, and the Cruze Eco, just $20 a year in fuel.The consumer magazine praised the $20,850 Toyota Prius C subcompact hybrid's 43 mpg combined fuel economy and its parking ease, but panned the C's stiff ride, steering, hard plastic interior, rear visibility, and wind and road noise.

SANAA, Yemen, Dec. 17 (UPI) -- A Yemeni natural gas company said it was the victim of sabotage when attackers struck a 38-inch pipeline connected to the country's coast."Yemen LNG confirms the sabotage of the 38-inch gas pipeline that links the block 18 to the Balhaf terminal on the Gulf of Aden," the company said.The attack took place early Sunday about 100 miles north of Balhaf.Last summer, the Yemeni government said it was losing around $15 million per day because of attacks on national energy infrastructure.Separatist ambitions and a lingering al-Qaida presence in Yemen have complicated political transition in the country.Yemen LNG last reported an attack on one of its pipelines in October. In November, the independent Yemen Post said tribesmen in central Yemen were using pipeline attacks as a bargaining tool with the government.State-owned SAFER E&P said there may be shortages of oil in Yemen because of downstream consequences of pipeline attacks.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4 (UPI) -- ABC and Emmy producer Don Mischer are preparing the first network awards show devoted to reality TV, according to Daily Variety.With the unscripted genre showing no signs of slowing down, ABC has contracted with Mischer to produce a two-hour awards show that will honor both the producers of and participants in reality TV. A blue-ribbon industry panel will select nominees, with viewers choosing winners via the Web and other means.Still in the early planning stages, the show is expected to air this fall. Categories are expected to range from the serious (best show, best host) to the subjective (best meltdown, best villain), with eligibility likely to encompass network and cable series and specials airing during the 2002-03 season, including this summer.

| License Photo	LAUSANNE, Switzerland, April 27 (UPI) -- Americans who contracted leprosy in the United States did so after direct contact with armadillos, an international team of researchers said.Researchers at the Global Health Institute at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Louisiana State University say there is clear evidence that a never-before-seen strain of Mycobacterium leprae emerged in the Southern United States and it can be transmitted via infected armadillos.Stewart Cole, head of the Global Health Institute, says it has been known since the 1970s that armadillos are potential carriers of the disease -- most likely introduced by European immigrants 500 years ago."There is a very strong association between the geographic location of the presence of this particular strain of M. leprae and the presence of armadillos in the Southern United States," Cole says in a statement. "Our research provides clear DNA evidence that the unique strain found in armadillos is the same as the one in certain humans."There are about 150 cases of leprosy in the United States each year, mostly contracted by people who have been abroad where leprosy is endemic, but health authorities found one-third of these patients were infected, but had not left the country.The scientists confirmed by DNA analysis that 28 wild armadillos and 22 leprosy patients all had the same strain of the leprosy bacteria.The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

| License Photo	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Jan. 17 (UPI) -- Google says it will join the online protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act currently being debated by the U.S. Congress.The search giant said it would post a link on the company's home page Wednesday to notify users of the company's opposition to SOPA, CNET News reported.Google said it will join Wikipedia, Reddit and other influential tech firms in staging online protests of varying kinds against SOPA and a similar Senate bill, the Protect IP Act (PIPA)."Like many businesses, entrepreneurs and web users, we oppose these bills because there are smart, targeted ways to shut down foreign rogue websites without asking American companies to censor the Internet," a Google spokeswoman said. "So tomorrow we will be joining many other tech companies to highlight this issue on our United States home page."Entertainment and media interests are backing both acts, but critics say they would stifle free speech on the Internet.One site not joining in the online protests is social media giant Twitter, pcmag.com reported.Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said the micro-blogging site would not be participating."That's just silly. Closing a global business in reaction to single-issue national politics is foolish," Costolo tweeted when asked by journalists if the company would be willing to shut down in protest, as Wikipedia has said it would do Wednesday.However, "Not shutting down a service doesn't equal not taking the proper stance on an issue," he said. "We've been very clear about our stance."[View the story "The battle over SOPA" on Storify]

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, March 31 (UPI) -- Dubai World Cup day was bittersweet for its creator, Sheik Mohammed bin Rasheed al Maktoum, and his Godolphin Racing.Godolphin won three of the eight Thoroughbred races on the nine-race card, including the signature $10 million World Cup with Monterroso.But Godolphin also suffered two of the day's three horse breakdowns. Two of the breakdowns appeared to be fatal, although Dubai racing officials would not officially confirm that.The World Cup program also turned up a potential Kentucky Derby contender. And while it was tough on horses based in Hong Kong and the United States, none of whom ran to their notices, horses who had run in Hong Kong did well, adding luster to the SAR's annual December turf races.All three breakdowns came in two attempts to run the $1 million Dubai Gold Cup, a 2-mile grass race that was added to the World Cup program this year.As the race went off the first time, Godolphin runner Fox Hunt fell badly at mid-stretch, in front of the grandstand. While the rest of the field raced on, Fox Hunt lay on the course, immobilized with his injuries. Since he was in the path of a second run down the stretch, the race was red-flagged.Dubai Racing Club officials, after consulting owners and trainers, rescheduled the race for the end of the night's program. In the restart, first Grand Vent, another Godolphin horse, and then Bronze Cannon, owned by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, were pulled up.Bronze Cannon appeared to have suffered a fatal injury. Grand Vent was walked onto a horse ambulance after initial treatment. DRC did not reveal the conditions of any horses.None of the three jockeys involved in the incidents was seriously injured.The breakdowns marred what otherwise would have been a grand day for Sheik Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, inventor of the World Cup and developer of the grand Meydan Race Course where it now is run.The night was capped with Godolphin's sixth World Cup win as Monterosso carried the day for the home team. With Mickael Barzalona up for trainer Mahmoud al Zarooni, the 5-year-old, British-bred son of Dubawi took charge in deep stretch to get home 3 lengths better than another Godolphin starter, Capponi. Planteur finished third.While winning the world's richest race is almost routine for the blue colors of Godolphin, it was the first World Cup win for both jockey and trainer. Monterosso finished third in the World Cup last year behind two Japanese horses.Barzalona said he was happy to get Monterosso into position at mid-stretch. "After that," he said, "I couldn't believe it when no one was coming after me. This is a dream. I have no words to describe what I feel right now."Disappointments in the race included the two American starters. Breeders' Cup Classic runner-up Game On Dude beat only one of his 13 rivals under female jockey Chantal Sutherland. Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic winner Royal Delta finished ninth. Irish-based So You Think ran his losing streak to four by finishing fourth and the Japanese starters showed little with last year's World Cup runner up, Transcend, finishing last.Both Sutherland and Royal Delta's rider, Jose Lezcano, said the all-weather Tapeta track proved difficult for their mounts, lending credence to the suggestion that a prep race over the course is a good idea."She gave me a good run at the end," Lezcano said of Royal Delta. "But this surface is a little different. It's a little sticky." Sutherland said Game On Dude also struggled. "This track is very tiring," she said.Godolphin got the program off to a flying start as African Story strode out nicely to win the $1 million Godolphin Mile. Both jockey Frankie Dettori and trainer Saeed bin Suroor had touted the 5-year-old Pivotal gelding as their best hope on the day and he did not disappoint, winning by 4 lengths over Vicount Nelson Red Jazz was third as the 1,600 meters went in 1:37.5.Fox Hound went down in the next race.The $2 million UAE Derby went to Daddy Long Legs, an American-bred son of Scat Daddy, whose only previous bad race in four starts came in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last fall at Churchill Downs. Daddy Long Legs rallied to win Saturday's race by 1 1/4 lengths over a French-trained 3-year-old, Yang Tse Kiang. Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf winner Wrote finished third.Winning rider Coln O'Donoghue said, "It's a great training effort by Aidan (O'Brien) to win this in his first run of the season against horses who were already primed and at their best. Hopefully he can keep improving from this. I think he can."O'Brien, who also trains Wrote, said he now is looking toward a return to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby with Daddy Long Legs."This is his first run here and if he has any chances then it has to be at the Kentucky Derby. He is such a beautiful horse. He has simply gone on improving with each race. Last year at the Breeder's Cup he was all at sea. But this time he has shown how capable he is. We were thinking to come here with the view to going to the Kentucky Derby if they ran well. Ryan's horse (Wrote) ran well but got a little tired."Ortensia stepped up for the Australian contingent with a victory in the $1 million Al Quoz Sprint, a 5-furlong (1,000 meter) dash down the turf chute. The 6-year-old Testa Rosa mare waited, then advanced down the middle of the course to score a 1 1/4-lengths victory over Sole Power. Joy and Fun, a Hong Kong-based runner, finished third -- one of the few good showings by what was thought to be a strong, nine-horse contingent from the SAR. Ortensiz finished in 57.98 seconds with Craig Williams riding.Krypton Factor, under Kieran Fallon, accounted for the $2 million Dubai Golden Shaheen, a race that once was thought to be a target for Australian super mare Black Caviar. Krypton Factor took advantage of a strong pace duel between last year's winner, Singapore-based Rocket Man, and U.S. runner Giant Ryan. Laying off the early pace, the 4-year-old British-bred horse came to challenge Rocket Man at mid-stretch and went on by him to win by 2 1/4 lengths. Rocket Man battled on gamely to finish second with Hong Kong's Lucky Nine again settling for show money. One of the strongest American chances on the day, The Factor, was no factor, finishing well behind the leaders. Krypton Factor got the 1,200 meters, about 6 furlongs, in 1:10.79."He was always going well for me tonight," said winning rider Kieren Fallon, "and I thought I had them covered a good way out. He's the kind of horse that thrives on racing and I'd love to ride him at Royal Ascot."Cityscape won the $5 million Dubai Duty Free with surprising ease over a field ranked among the night's toughest. With James Doyle up, the Juddmonte Farms homebred ran away from the competition in the stretch, winning by 4 1/4 lengths. Mutahadee finished second and City Style, another from the Godolphin barn, took third. Cityscape, a 6-year-old, ran the 1,800 meters, or about 1 1/8 miles, on the turf course in 1:48.6. Three of Hong Kong's top horses, Xtension, Ambitious Dragon and California Memory, finished fifth, seventh and 12th, respectively."Early on when I settled in and got my position, I thought it would take some catching," Doyle said. "When we turned into the straight, I couldn't believe the turn of foot he had. He kept finding more. It's amazing."Ambitious Dragon's rider, Douglas Whyte, said his mount was "very stirred up in the paddock beforehand, which is not like him. He was in an ok position but he didn't find anything. You didn't see the real Ambitious Dragon tonight."Cirrus des Aigles hung on in the final yards to win the $5 million Sheema Classic at 2,410 meters, or about 1 1/2 miles, on the turf course. Jockey Olivier Peslier coaxed just enough stamina from the 6-year-old, French-bred gelding to hold off Breeders' Cup Turf winner St Nicholas Abbey by a neck. Jackkalberry narrowly beat Treasure Beach for third. Cirrus des Aigles covered the distance in 2:31.3.Cirrus des Aigles won the Champion Stakes at Ascot last fall and trainer Corine Barande Barbe said the feeling of winning in Dubai is similar. "And the horse seems to like big race courses," she added. Olivier let him go as the horse knows about racing and it is a big deal to win this race."In the restart of the Dubai Gold Cup, although Godolphin lost another horse to injury in Grand Vent, it also won the race as Opinion Poll finished ahead of Joshua Tree by 3/4 length. It was a short head farther back to Zanzamar in third. Opinion Poll, a 6-year-old son of Halling, ran the 3,200 meters in 3:23.7 with Dettori scoring his second win of the night."It's been a great night for the team and I'm pleased it's gone so well for us," Dettori said. "I was very happy to win this race and it all went according to plan. I think we'll target the Ascot Gold Cup in June."In the first race of the day, the $250,000 Dubai Kahayla Classic for purebred Arabians, TM Fred Texas took charge on the outside at mid-stretch and went on to win by 1 3/4 lengths. The 5-year-old Texas-bred was the Arabian Horse of the Year in the United States but stepping up in class against a field dominated by horses bred in Europe. He now has 11 wins from 15 starts.

| License Photo	LONDON, Dec. 19 (UPI) -- No. 2-ranked men's player Novak Djokovic and No. 1 women's player Serena Williams were selected the ITF world champions for 2013.The International Tennis Federation made the announcement Thursday, giving Djokovic the honor for a third consecutive year and Williams for the fourth time in her career.It was no surprise Serena Williams was the ITF's choice among the women players. Williams was 78-4 on the year, winning a record $12.4 million. She had 11 titles, including wins at the French Open and U.S. Open.But that Djokovic was chosen over Rafael Nadal was unexpected. Nadal overtook Djokovic for the world No. 1 ranking after winning the U.S. Open and was 75-7 on the year with 10 titles.Djokovic did have a sterling year, winning a third consecutive Australian Open and finishing second at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. He was 74-9 with seven titles overall.U.S. twins Bob and Mike Bryan were selected the ITF men's doubles world champion while Italians Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci took the women's doubles award.The ITF honors are determined on an "objective system that considers all results during the year, but gives special weight to the Grand Slam tournaments, and two ITF international team competitions, Davis Cup by BNP Paribas and Fed Cup by BNP Paribas," the ITF said in a release.

Ted Williams' "Golden Voice"
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 26 (UPI) -- The homeless Ohio man whose "golden voice" video became an Internet sensation says he's left a Texas rehab facility because he was unhappy with his treatment.Ted Williams voluntarily checked himself out of the Origins Recovery Center in South Padre Island, the Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch reported Wednesday.Williams, 53, had spent less than two weeks there after a three-episode appearance on the syndicated talk show "Dr. Phil."A family friend said Williams plans to pursue similar help through an outpatient center at some point."He wants recovery," said the friend, who asked to remain anonymous. "That's the only thing that's going to help him."The friend said Williams was disturbed by the sight of cameras when he arrived at the center, a medication regimen so heavy that "when he wasn't in (therapy) class, he was asleep" and requests to give on-air interviews with show host Phil McGraw."Where's the confidentiality?" the friend said. "They exploited him.""The decision to remain in treatment is Ted's to make," McGraw said in a statement Monday. "We certainly hope that he continues his commitment to sobriety, and we will continue to help and support him in any way that we can. We wish him well."

BELLAIRE, Texas, May 1 (UPI) -- A 6-month-old Texas girl whose parents created an online bucket list after learning she had a fatal illness has died, her father said.Mike Canahuati of Bellaire, Texas, near Houston said on the blog his daughter Avery Lynn, who was born with spinal muscular atrophy type 1, died Monday of pulmonary complications related to the genetic disorder, CNN reported.Canahuati said he revived her for a short time with life-saving techniques but she died before arriving at the hospital."Avery's passing this quickly came as a complete shock to all of us, as she had just been given a thumbs up at her last doctors appointment only three days ago," her father wrote Tuesday. "While we were aware of the severity of her diagnosis, we never lost hope for Avery and even in her passing, we still have hope for our daughter and all of her friends."The blog, at averycan.blogspot.com, went viral and had more than 2.8 million page views by Tuesday afternoon. Her father had written the blog entries as if Avery had written them. While doctors said she would not live past age 2, the bucket list included experiences her parents hoped she would have as a healthy girl.In an entry Tuesday, Avery's father wrote: "Dear Mommy & Daddy: If you're reading this it's because I've gone to take care of my Uncle Bryant, Nana Carolyn, Papa George, and all my great Grandparents. I love you veeeeeeeeeery much. Also, tell Nana & G-Pa I love them too. In fact, tell everyone who loved me that I love them and I appreciate them caring about me."Avery, the blog says, had gotten some of what she included on the bucket list -- giving her mother and father a kiss, blowing bubbles and throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game (a Houston-area minor league baseball team's game).The Canahuatis said one in 6,000 babies is born with one of four types of SMA. Her father said on the blog he would continue working to promote SMA awareness and help find a cure.

UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (UPI) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon renewed his appeal Monday for unrestricted access in Syria for the U.N. team investigating alleged chemical weapons use."A credible and comprehensive inquiry requires full access to the sites where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used. I again urge the Syrian authorities to allow the investigation to proceed without delay and without any conditions," Ban said before meeting with the head of the investigation, Ake Sellstrom, at U.N. Headquarters in New York.Sellstrom, a Swedish scientist, was appointed to lead the fact-finding mission, named following a formal request from the Syrian government. The initial focus of the probe will be an incident involving the alleged use of chemical weapons in Kfar Dael region in Khan al-Asal area in Aleppo governate.The fact-finding team has been on stand-by and is ready to deploy within 24- to 48 hours. An advance team is positioned in Cyprus, the United Nations said in a release."This is a crucial moment in our efforts to get the team on the ground to carry out its important task," Ban said. "I take seriously the recent intelligence report of the United States about the use of chemical weapons in Syria. On-site activities are essential if the United Nations is to be able to establish the facts and clear up all the doubts surrounding this issue." Ban said Sellstrom and his colleagues have been gathering and analyzing available information while waiting for consent to enter Syria.Noting Monday was the annual Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Chemical Warfare, Ban said, "As we address these allegations, I encourage all involved to uphold their responsibilities in enabling us to properly police these heinous weapons of massive destruction."

NANDAZ, Switzerland, Dec. 20 (UPI) -- An avalanche in Switzerland killed a 23-year-old Swedish skier, rescue officials of the Verbier skiing region said.Rescuers found the unnamed woman trapped under snow Wednesday and seriously injured after she was carried by a sheet of snow 100 meters (328 feet) wide and 250 meters (820 feet) long that detached from the slope. She died at a Sion, Switzerland, hospital after she was transported by helicopter, the Swedish news website The Local.se reported Thursday.Her three skiing colleagues escaped injury. The group was skiing off-piste, on fresh snow not yet compacted into tracks, the website said. With milder weather conditions following two days of heavy snow, police had issued a regional avalanche warning, and Eric Belet, director of the ski resort, told the Swiss newspaper 20 Minutes explosives had been used Wednesday morning to make high-risk ski areas safer.
