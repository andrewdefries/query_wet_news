DUBLIN, Ireland, Sept. 27 (UPI) -- The European energy commissioner said the inauguration of an electricity line between Ireland and the British coast is an example of the gains of collaboration.European Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger joined Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny at a ceremony to inaugurate of the 159-mile interconnector, a first for the region."This good example of cross-border integration of energy markets is a milestone in the continued efforts by Ireland to develop its electricity grid and to respond to changing markets and opportunities," he said in a statement.The interconnector runs between north Wales and the Irish coast. It can carry as much as 500 megawatts of electricity and can integrate offshore wind energy in the region.Oettinger said Ireland has tripled its renewable energy production in the past decade and is on pace to become a net electricity exporter."The combined pressures of climate change, dwindling fossil fuel production, global demand growth and changing geopolitics are taking their toll," said Oettinger. "I believe that the only way to deal with these global challenges is through a more Europeanized energy policy."

MUMBAI, Jan. 28 (UPI) -- The Indian division of Greenpeace said Tuesday it was being sued for about $79 million in a defamation suit for actions against Essar Group's mining activity.Greenpeace said Tuesday the Indian conglomerate filed a defamation suit in the high court in Mumbai in response to a campaign against Essar's mining operations.Essar issued a statement Monday saying action taken last week by Greenpeace caused "immense damage" to its reputation."Essar holds the defendants liable for damages and has accordingly, sought appropriate redress from both civil and criminal courts," it said.Greenpeace activists last week climbed the side of the building housing Essar's headquarters in Mumbai, unfurling a banner saying the company is "killing forests" with its coal mine activities."We are being sued by Essar because their underhanded tactics have been exposed," Greenpeace said.The advocacy group said 67 activists were arrested after the protest action. The Wall Street Journal reports the mining activity in the central state of Madhya Pradesh still needs the government's approval to move forward.Greenpeace activists last year were detained by Russian authorities following similar protests against oil drilling in arctic waters.

CANTERBURY, England, Jan. 29 (UPI) -- A British facial mapping expert says some may be born leaders because most agree leadership and success is equated with certain facial features. Senior lecturer in physics and a facial mapping expert Dr. Chris Solomon and his research team at the University of Kent's Canterbury campus in England asked 100 people to rank 100 faces in order of their perceived business acumen and leadership qualities.In men, success and leadership were equated to a rectangular face with angular features, focused eyes, a thin straight mouth and healthy skin, KentOnline.com reported. Women thought to be good leaders would have an oval face with wide, alert eyes, well-defined features and arched eyebrows, Solomon said. "There is no question that we subconsciously respond to people's facial appearance in all kinds of ways and it takes most people about three seconds to form a first impression on someone," said Solomon, whose research includes image processing and reconstruction facial encoding.In Britain, Nick Clegg. leader of the Liberal Democrats, had the most successful looking "political face" with Prime Minister David Cameron not far behind. Cameron is leader of the Conservative Party in Britain. However, two other British politicians were found lacking and it was suggested they would need to spend about $40,000 between them for rhinoplasty, eye bag removal and chin implants to become more "electable," Solomon said. However, Solomon said he is not suggesting aspiring political leaders get plastic surgery. "In the United States, politicians go to great lengths to make sure their appearance is immaculate, but I like to think people here are not quite as shallow as that and once they've had the opportunity of hearing and seeing somebody they'll form an opinion based on the actual facts," Solomon told KentOnline.com.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 28 (UPI) -- Authorities in Florida said a Haitian man allegedly used a former co-worker's identity to obtain a U.S. passport he used for six years.The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Fla., states that when Todd Terrell Blanding applied for a passport in June officials discovered a passport had been issued in his name six years earlier, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Friday.Agents with the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service interviewed Blanding three days later and showed him a picture of the man who obtained a passport in his name. He recognized the man as "Jean Joseph," a man from Haiti he had worked with several years earlier.Agents said they identified "Jean Joseph" as Wilde Jean-Louis and discovered he had "repeatedly" traveled between the United States and Haiti using the passport he obtained in Blanding's name. Jean-Louis isn't a U.S. citizen, investigators said.Jean-Louis was arrested Dec. 6 on federal charges including identity theft, aggravated identity theft, falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen and making a false statement on a passport application. He filed an unopposed motion Thursday to continue his arraignment to Jan. 31.

a service of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Can disaster risk reduction lessons be learned from China?
lead photo
BEIJING, 29 April 2013 (IRIN) - China, which annually faces almost
every disaster possible - including earthquakes, floods, cyclones and
landslides - is doing something right in the field of disaster risk
reduction (DRR), experts say.
"China has learned from the experience of many years of heavy human and
economic losses how important it is to put a cap on annual acceptable
losses if it is to succeed in protecting its economic and social
development. It is now aiming to keep disaster losses at no more than
1.5 percent loss of GDP," UN Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for DRR Margareta Wahlstr

LONDON, Oct. 12 (UPI) -- An investigation by Britain's Legal Services Commission has delayed the sale of a London house allegedly owned by radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza.Officials say that Hamza bought the house for 220,000 pounds ($409,000) while he was receiving legal aid, The Telegraph reported. He was sentenced earlier this year to seven years in prison for incitement to murder.The commission said it will try to recover some of the cost of defending Hamza. His total legal bill has been estimated at 250,000 pounds ($465,000).Hamza was formerly the imam of London's Finsbury Park mosque.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 2 (UPI) -- The U.S. Secret Service says it's interviewed most of the women involved in the Colombia prostitution scandal and none appear to have ties to terror groups.Officials said they've questioned 10 women and plan to question the other two women soon, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.The Secret Service says 135 of 175 agents and officers deployed to Colombia for President Obama's trip to last month's Summit of the Americas stayed at the Hotel Caribe, where the scandal occurred.The 10 women said they were paid for their encounters.A Secret Service report given Thursday to the congressional committee investigating the scandal said nine of the 12 Secret Service employees allegedly involved have successfully completed polygraph exams. Three employees, whoever, have not cooperated with requests to take exams, CNN reported.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-N.Y., told CNN the three agents were among the first to lose their jobs in the scandal. One agent said in the polygraph test that he did not realize the woman was a prostitute and threw her out of the room when she said she wanted to get paid. King said the agent has not been fired.House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., have said security personnel involved in the scandal showed an "alarming lack" of "character" and "judgment."Twelve members of the military have also been implicated in the scandal.

MARIANNA, Fla., Sept. 3 (UPI) -- Researchers Tuesday wrapped up their initial digging for human remains at the former state-run Dozier School for Boys in Florida, WTVT-TV, Tampa, reported.The TV station said the team from the University of South Florida, which had been working at the cemetery behind the former school in Marianna since last week, has removed two skeletons. The researchers will now try to identify the bodies and determine how they died. WTVT-TV said 10 families had been contacted as part of the effort to identify the remains. Some relatives of boys believed to have died at the former school have given their DNA in hopes of finding a match.USF researchers employed radar to find 50 undocumented graves last year. Their research documented a total of 96 boys' deaths at the school, which operated from 1900 to 2011. Dozens of remains may be found eventually, if the researchers' initial testing proves accurate.A group of men who call themselves the Black Boys of Dozier and the White House Boys have come forward with stories of physical and sexual abuse at the school in the 1950s and 1960s. Others have told about boys who disappeared and others who were beaten by guards.

SYDNEY, April 27 (UPI) -- Australian mining tycoon Clive Palmer said his candidacy for prime minister under the banner of a new political party he is forming is a serious gesture.Palmer unveiled the United Australia Party Friday and formally threw his hat into the ring for the September elections."I am standing because I think I can offer better service to the community than anyone else," Palmer told reporters.Palmer, who made his fortune in mining and natural resources, enjoys a high public profile, in large part due to his proposal to build a $200 million replica of the ocean liner Titanic, The New York Times said. He was also a major financial supporter of the conservative Liberal-National Party but resigned last year amid disputes over his own political aspirations.Palmer might have a chance of winning the September election. The Times noted Prime Minister Julia Gillard has seen her public support erode this year, and her Labor Party has had its own internal conflicts.Conservatives reacted quickly to Palmer's move, urging voters to stick with the Liberal-National Party as the best bet to unseating Gillard and the Labor Party.

Sochi officials said that it's standard for track testers to give a warning signal before descending. "The reasons for the icemaker’s presence on the track after the warning signal are currently being determined," they said.IOC President Thomas Bach said that the worker's injuries were not life-threatening. "The worker is undergoing surgery for two open fractures in his legs," he said in a statement. "We're pretty relieved," he added. "It’s a reminder that this is a really dangerous sport we’re taking part in," Canadian bobsledder Christopher Spring told the New York Times. "It’s a shame. It sounds like it was a miscommunication; it’s a pretty new track here, so who knows."[New York Times, ABC News, USA Today]
