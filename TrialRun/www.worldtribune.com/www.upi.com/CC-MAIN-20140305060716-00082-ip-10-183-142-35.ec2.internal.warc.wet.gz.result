WASHINGTON, June 27 (UPI) -- With daily killings of coalition troops, sabotage of oil pipelines, uncontrolled crime, continuing shortages of electricity and water, and rising Iraqi hostility to occupation, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is looking, two months after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, for ways to end the disarray in U.S. policy on Iraq. Writing in the New York Times last Thursday, John S. Burnett gave a snapshot of the current disorder. Reporting from southern Iraq, he wrote that among other ills:"Lawlessness is endemic. Alongside the highway, boys scale electric poles with wire cutters (the electric cables have copper that can be sold) while their elders look on. To the south, in Umm Qasr, Iraq's only deep-sea port, young men climb atop trucks chartered by the World Food Program, casually tossing down 100-pound bags of flour to their friends waiting below, while a Spanish military unit guarding its ship stands by impotently only yards away. There is no police force of any note here -- and if a policeman had a gun and was to fire, he would just start his own interfamily war."In an interview on June 17, an unnamed senior British official at the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad told the Daily Telegraph of London that it was, "The single most chaotic organization I have ever worked for." "The operation is chronically under-resourced and suffers from an almost complete absence of strategic direction," according to the official.Last week, Patrick Cockburn, a British journalist particularly knowledgeable about Iraq, reported from Baghdad that the few Iraqis who have joined the authority describe the American officials administering Iraq as living in an air-conditioned fantasy world.The head of the authority, L. Paul Bremer, speaking at an air-conditioned press conference, said that with a few exceptions, Baghdad was receiving 20 hours of electricity a day."'It simply isn't true,'" said one Iraqi, shaking his head in disbelief after listening to Bremer. "'Everybody in Baghdad knows it,'" Cockburn reported him as saying.The day Burnett's account appeared, John Hamre -- the president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a prestigious Washington think-tank -- who had been deputy secretary of defense in the Clinton administration, left for Iraq. He did so at the behest of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, a CSIS spokesman told United Press International. Hamre was heading a team of five that will spend about 10 days attending meetings in Baghdad and touring the country. As informal advisers, the team's task is to assess the reconstruction effort in Iraq for Rumsfeld and Bremer.The Hamre mission came as U.S. military and diplomatic experts charged the Bush administration with bungling the post-conflict situation in Iraq."There is no longer anyway to tap dance around the responsibility of the administration for what more and more looks like a monumental bog up," Thomas Houlahan, told UPI. Houlahan is the Washington-based director of a military assessment program for James Madison University at Harrisburg, Va. He is also a former paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division and staff officer with the 18th Airborne Corps. The planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Houlahan says, "was very slipshod and not up to the standards of the U.S. Army."Timothy Carney, a former U.S. ambassador who has just returned from two months in Iraq, has said much the same thing. Carney, with long experience in post-conflict zones, told the British Broadcasting Corp. that the White House failed to think through post-war plans and that there was a lack of resources and of priority for reconstruction efforts.A grievous flaw in the initial U.S. post-conflict effort, the BBC reported him as saying, was that the reconstruction team was under the command of military officers who either did not understand or did not give sufficient priority to rebuilding Iraq. Reconstruction efforts were further hampered by a lack of troops, he said.A well-known writer on military, Ralph Peters, told UPI there has been what he called a Stalinist refusal by the administration to admit that anything in its plan for Iraq could go wrong. Peters is a retired lieutenant colonel with a background in military intelligence. Referring to the looting that followed the fall of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, Houlahan says U.S. irresponsibility, however unintentional, rises to the level of violation of the rules of war. "Once you are in a city, you are responsible for it," he said.Asked how the White House and Defense Department went wrong, Houlahan answered that, "Virtually no thought at all went into what to do in Iraq after the war." Rumsfeld, he said, "made the whole operation more difficult than it needed to be and increased the risks to the soldiers."One result, Houlahan said, was that, "We are using armored forces for peacekeeping, when we have light divisions doing nothing."Houlahan did not spare the military. "There are too many senior leaders in the armed forces who are boot-licking yes-men," he said. "If serious and well-presented objections had been raised, Rumsfeld would not have created so many problems." Damage was done to the Army's structure in the Clinton years, Houlahan argued, in good part by the Army itself. Heroes of the Gulf war were passed over for promotion as too controversial. Instead, as he sees it, politicians in uniform got the promotions.Peters, asserting that neo-conservatives such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and others were behind the war, said they "talked themselves into believing a scenario in which the Iraqis would magically restructure themselves.""The neo-cons underestimated the probability of resistance from Baath elements," Peters says. "Iraq has a population of about 23 million; 1 or 2 million had a real stake in the Baath system and of these tens of thousands remain emotionally committed to it."Yonah Alexander of the Potomac Institute for Policy Analysis takes a similar view: "The White House and Pentagon thought that once a knockout blow was delivered to the Iraqi forces, they would be able to tell the Iraqis what to do." So, Alexander says, there was no organization prepared to insure security and carry out reconstruction.There is a window of opportunity to make good on the country's liberation, Alexander says, but it is closing fast. Houlahan shares the same sense of urgency: "We need to get our act together in a matter of weeks, not months."There is irony in Rumsfeld seeking advice from Hamre. According to CSIS, Hamre was chosen because Rumsfeld liked a CSIS report, published before the war, on what to do in post-conflict Iraq. The report contained 10 recommendations by Hamre and Gordon Sullivan, president of the Association of the United States Army. The first was: "Create a Transitional Security Force that is effectively prepared, mandated, and staffed to handle post-conflict civil-security needs, including the need for constabulary forces."Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration appear to have completely ignored the recommendation.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Sikorsky is set to begin assembly of its S-97 Raider light attack helicopter this week and an announcement from the manufacturer is expected soon.A Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. spokesperson confirmed the schedule, which marks the imminent entry of Sikorsky in a market likely to give the manufacturer an edge, at least for now, over competition in the tactical attack area."Imagine a next-generation attack helicopter platform so advanced that it can reach speeds more than 220 knots, flying as high as 10,000 feet in 95 degrees of heat," Defense News said. The Sikorsky S-97 Raider helicopter is poised to realize this vision and to revolutionize next-generation military aviation, the news website said.Industry analysts told United Press International the S-97 carried huge potential in the right conditions.Modern warfare is going through profound changes, not least because of the entry of increasingly sophisticated unmanned aerial systems. Advancements in unmanned aircraft are likely to see more innovations, multitasking and the appearance of various unmanned vehicles in military and quasi-civilian roles such as search and rescue.Amid this flux comes the S-97 Raider with multi-mission capabilities expects to meet initially conventional U.S. Army and Special Operations future requirements in a variety of combat roles. Foreign orders usually follow on from there.There could be S-97 Raider applications for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and the Marine Corps, Defense News said. Industry analysts told UPI similar versatility would likely be applied in any international purchases of the aircraft. There's a huge market waiting to be tapped in the Middle East, East Asia and parts of Africa, they said.The S-97 was formally launched on October 2010 and is intended as a possible contender for the U.S. Army's armed aerial scout duties, replacing the Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior.The U.S. Special Operations Command is also said to be eyeing the aircraft as a a replacement for the HM-6 Little Bird though no details are known yet.Sikorsky says the S-97 applies proven technology and mission systems to meet the Armed Aerial Scout requirements with low risk.The aircraft should enter ground and flight testing in 2014, Flightglobal said on its website.In addition to flying at nearly twice the speed of a conventional helicopter, the S-97 Raider prototype aircraft will incorporate other key performance parameters critical to combat operations: increased maneuverability, greater endurance, reduced acoustic noise signature, and the ability to operate at high altitudes, Aurora Flight Sciences said on its website.Shephard Media reported in March Sikorsky has placed a $15 million price tag on the S-97 Raider, "as it attempts to convince the U.S. Army that the aircraft is a low-risk replacement for the Kiowa Warrior."The price was mentioned by Sikorsky executives at the Heli-Expo exhibition in Las Vegas last March. Sikorsky has headquarters in Stratford, Conn.

SYDNEY, Nov. 24 (UPI) -- A movie about Michael Hutchence, the late lead singer of the Australian rock group INXS, is in preproduction, screenwriter Bobby Galinsky said.Hutchence died of an apparent suicide in 1997 after INXS enjoyed a stellar run at the top of the charts in the 1980s."I've been a writer for 35 years and this is something I've wanted to do for over a decade and everything has now come together," Galinsky told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Galinsky said Hutchence's life and death will be chronicled from the point of view of his family.The script will be based on a biography written by Hutchence's mother and sister, Rolling Stone said."It's not a sex, drugs and rock and roll tabloid situation," said Galinsky. "Who was Michael Hutchence? What drove him? What were his demons and his loves?"The BBC said Galinsky, who wrote the 1990 film "Flatliners," has been interviewing actors and would finalize casting next year.

Dustin Bockman set a new weight record for an alligator taken during hunting season with a 727 pound specimen. By VERONICA LINARES, UPI.com | Blog | Sept. 3, 2013 at 8:07 AM | Updated Sept. 3, 2013 at 11:45 AM | 0 comments

Sept. 3 (UPI) -- Alligator hunters in Mississippi set multiple records during the first weekend of the state's alligator season. Beth Trammell was the first to set a record after catching a 13-foot-5.5-inch, 723.5-pound alligator in the early morning, but a few hours later Dustin Bockman, a UPS driver from Vicksburg, set a new weight record with a 13-foot-4.5-inch, 727-pound alligator caught in the Mississippi River near the Big Black River in Claiborne County. "He broke all the lines we could put in him. Finally [we] put a snare on him and got him up high enough and put a shot on him. All in all probably took us four and a half hours to catch him from the first time we saw him," Bockman said Monday.Bockman's catch now holds the current weight record for a gator taken during alligator hunting season by a Mississippi hunter. The current length record is 13 feet, 6.5 inches from an alligator taken on the Pascagoula River in 2008.Brandon Maskew of Ellisville also set a record over the weekend with a female alligator after catching a 10 foot long 295.3 pound alligator Friday.

KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo, May 23 (UPI) -- U.N. peacekeepers are working to protect civilians in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo from fighting tied to a rebel military general, an official said.Roger Meece, director of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in DRC, said via video conference peacekeepers were responding to violence instigated by an April mutiny led by rebel Gen. Bosco Ntaganda.The International Criminal Court has sought the arrest of Ntaganda since 2006. Human Rights Watch said he recruited at least 140 boys and young men, of whom about 10 percent were under the age of 15, into his forces since he rebelled in mid-April.Some of Ntaganda's associates wanted by the ICC are tied to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a militant group linked to the Rwandan genocide in 1994.Meece said peacekeepers were working to protect civilians from fighting between Ntaganda's forces and those from the DRC military.The fighting, he added in his statement, has led to the "significant" displacement of civilians.The United Nations estimates around 30,000 Congolese people have fled the country because of recent fighting.ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo last week sought to add war crimes and crimes against humanity charges to the arrest warrant for Ntaganda.

| License Photo	SANFORD, Fla., July 16 (UPI) -- The friend on the phone with Trayvon Martin when the confrontation on a Sanford, Fla., street with George Zimmerman began says she is angered by the acquittal.Rachel Jeantel called the verdict "BS" and said Martin, 17, wasn't aggressive but someone who "loved his family" and was a good friend, CNN reported Monday.Zimmerman, a Hispanic-American neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting death of the unarmed Martin, who was black. Jeantel was a key prosecution witness in the case who was criticized on national television for her dress, weight, demeanor on the stand and her speech.Jeantel also derided arguments the case lacked a racial dimension."It was racial. Let's be honest, racial," Jeantel told CNN. "If Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, would that happen?"After calling police and being told by the dispatcher not to do anything, Zimmerman told detectives Martin began beating him when he approached and he shot Martin to save his own life. However, Zimmerman didn't testify during the trial, and Jeantel said his defense was "acting like a punk" by trying to portray Martin as a deadly threat."If you were a real man you would have stand on that stage and tell what happened," she said, calling Zimmerman "weak" and "scary."In Los Angeles, city officials Monday commended police for their response to violence arising from a protest of the verdict and warned as of Tuesday, there would be a crackdown on similar actions, the Los Angeles Times reported.About 350 Los Angeles Police Department officers flocked the city's Crenshaw district after groups of youths broke away from a peaceful protest in Leimert Park, damaging vehicles, smashing windows, setting fires and attacking several people, including a television reporter and his cameraman. As of late Monday, at least 13 people had been arrested on suspicion of committing a number of offenses, the LAPD said. At a news conference, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti blamed the violence on a "small group [that] has taken advantage of this situation."While protesters have the right to disagree with the verdict, "people also deserve to be safe on the streets and in their cars," he said.LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said officers would have a more aggressive position toward protesters beginning Tuesday."This will not be allowed to continue," Beck said.In Oakland, hundreds of protesters clogged Interstate 880 near downtown Monday evening, blocking traffic both ways, the Times said. After protesters were cleared from the freeway, they went downtown, where multiple arrests were made, authorities said.

CAIRO, Aug. 13 (UPI) -- The move by the Egyptian president to amass more power by removing his military chiefs has been met with conflicting opinions, analysts said Monday.The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces had no immediate comment on President Mohamed Morsi's forced retirement Sunday of Egypt's most senior military officers, including Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who led the 21-member military council after Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president. Tantawi, 76, was Egypt's de facto leader between Mubarak's ousting and Morsi's election.Also presumptively ousted was SCAF Deputy Chairman Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Anan, 64, the armed forces chief of staff, widely seen as Tantawi's likely successor.Both were kept on as presidential advisers with undisclosed roles, Morsi spokesman Yasser Ali said.White House press secretary Jay Carney said it was important that Egyptian military and civilian leaders work together to address economic and security challenges facing the country."We hope that President Morsi's announcements will serve the interests of the Egyptian people and maintain good relations with Egypt's neighbors," Carney said Monday during a news briefing. He said the United States will work with Egypt's civilian and military interests."In particular, we are ready to help President Morsi and the military as they continue to work to prevent extremists from operating in the Sinai," Carney said.Morsi promoted others within the military to replace Tantawi and Anan, CNN reported Monday.Also pushed out were the chiefs of the navy, air forces and air defense.He additionally nullified a constitutional declaration, issued by the military junta hours before Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood declared victory in the presidential race June 24, that gutted his office's authority -- and replaced it with his own declaration that gave him broad legislative and executive powers.He is now supreme commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces and president of the National Defense Council, as well as Egypt's president.The surprise concentration of power strengthens Morsi's position and weakens that of the military, in what Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Institution's Doha Center called "a mix of civilian counter-coup and a coordinated coup within the military itself."The Wall Street Journal said the new powers Morsi, who resigned the Muslim Brotherhood presidency when he won the election, gave to himself and his office exceeded even those enjoyed by Mubarak.The New York Times said his new powers could potentially also give him a decisive role in the drafting of Egypt's still unfinished new Constitution.The public was given no advance notice of Sunday's decision, and Tantawi and Anan's replacements were sworn in immediately after the shakeup announcement in brief ceremonies aired live on state TV.The White House and State Department said they too received no advance notice of the firings and had no immediate comment.Morsi said in a speech his decisions were not meant to "embarrass" the military or its leaders but to act in "the best interests of this nation.""Today, this nation returns -- this people return -- with its blessed revolution," he said. "Support me strongly, so we can move to a better future."Hundreds of people gathered outside the presidential palace and in downtown Cairo's Tahrir Square with banners to declare their allegiance to the president Sunday night into early Monday.Morsi's move raised the possibility of a new confrontation with Egypt's highest judicial power, some analysts said.The Supreme Constitutional Court already ruled the military's constitutional declaration gutting the president's powers was legal. Morsi reversed and claimed to supersede the declaration."This is a civilian-led putsch. It's extralegal," Egypt expert Michael Wahid Hanna, a fellow at New York's Century Foundation progressive think tank, told the Journal. "It requires for the Supreme Constitutional Court to cease to be a binding force. I don't think there's any other way around it."The court is widely seen as a politicized body that includes judges who share the military's distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood."He's clearly done his homework and clearly cultivated another group of officers that has allowed him to do this. If he can make this stick, it's a very important moment in Morsi's effort to consolidate his own political power," said Steven Cook, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.Morsi now "assumes legislative and executive power. He is extraordinarily powerful," Cook added.The Muslim Brotherhood demonstrated Sunday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo to support Morsi's moves. Protesters demonstrated at the defense ministry's headquarters, CNN said.The military's reduction in influence is "a significant shift in the civil-military balance of power, toward the civilian side. This is thew first time in Egypt's political history that an elected civilian politician overrules the decision of the heads of the military establishment," said Omar Ashour, visiting scholar at the Brooking's' Doha Center.Morsi's firings came a week after 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed in northern Sinai by suspected Islamist extremists. Those killings, at a military outpost near the border with Israel, prompted Morsi Wednesday to fire his intelligence chief, several high-level Interior Ministry officials and the head of his own presidential guard.

She is known for her acting roles including two television series: Family (1976-1980), an ABC television-network drama, and Family Ties (1982-1989), an NBC television-network situation comedy.
She was born Meredith Ann Baxter in South Pasadena, California, the daughter of actress and situation-comedy creator Whitney Blake and Tom Baxter, a radio announcer.

Baxter got her first big break on television in 1972 as one of the stars of the Bridget Loves Bernie, a CBS television-network situation comedy.
