WASHINGTON, June 20 (UPI) -- Sales of existing U.S. homes increased April-to-May and the national median price rose sharply for the sixth consecutive month, a trade group said Wednesday.The National Association of Realtors, which tracks sales of existing homes, said sales rose 4.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.18 million homes in May -- the highest annual rate of sales since November 2009, when the rate stood at 5.44 million.Sales were 12.9 percent higher than in May 2012, when the annual rate was 4.59 million.Some markets have experienced low inventories of homes for sale in recent months, allowing prices to rise. In May, the national median prices for existing homes of all types was $208,000, a 15.4 percent increase from May 2012 and the sixth consecutive month the increase has been in double digits.May's gain is the largest annual jump since October 2005, the NAR said.It was the 15th consecutive months of increases, which has not happened since March 2005 to May 2006."The housing numbers are overwhelmingly positive. However, the number of available homes is unlikely to grow, despite a nice gain in May, unless new home construction ramps up quickly by an additional 50 percent," said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.The total inventory of existing homes on the market rose 3.3 percent from April to May to 2.22 million.At the current rate of sales, the inventory represents a 5.1-month supply of homes. In April, there was a 5.2 month supply of homes on the market.Existing home sales rose 1.6 percent in the Northeast and jumped 8 percent in the Midwest. Sales in the South rose 4 percent, while in the West sales rose 2.5 percent, NAR said.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 (UPI) -- The U.S. Energy Department announced it was offering a $967 million loan guarantee to back a 290-megawatt solar plant in Arizona.U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced the loan for Aqua Caliente Solar to support the construction of a solar generating facility in Yuma County, Ariz.The Energy Department said that when the facility is completed, it would be one of the largest plants of its kind in the world."The Agua Caliente Solar project will bring hundreds of jobs to Arizona, while helping increase the reliability of renewable solar power," Chu said in a statement.The Energy Department said the United States had a dominant position in the solar energy sector in 1995, manufacturing 43 percent of the world's solar panels. That market share slipped to 7 percent last year, however.The so-called SunShot program by the U.S. government aims to spur American innovations to reduce the cost of solar energy.U.S. President Barack Obama in a January address to the nation laid out a clean-energy target of meeting 80 percent of U.S. energy needs with clean sources by 2035.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, July 8 (UPI) -- Lebanon needs to take action to prevent Israel from siphoning off its offshore oil and natural gas reserves, the Lebanese energy minister said.Lebanon has expressed frustration to the United Nations regarding the status of its maritime border with Israel. Shiite resistance movement Hezbollah last year warned Israel to stay away from Lebanon's offshore reserves because of border issues.Lebanon is eager to attract investors to its fledgling oil and natural gas sector. Israel, meanwhile, is looking to capitalize on the natural gas prospects from its offshore Leviathan and Tamar natural gas fields.Lebanese Energy Minister Gebran Bassil said Israeli natural gas fields are situated within 5 miles of the maritime border."Theoretically this means that Israel now has the possibility to reach Lebanese oil and this is a new and dangerous development," he was quoted Friday as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.The Lebanese government has said parts of the Leviathan natural gas field offshore Israel are in its territorial waters. There may be more than 400 million barrels of oil and 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in place off Lebanon. Beirut is working to coordinate an offshore oil and natural gas licensing round later this year.

ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- The U.S. Marine Corps has released advanced software for electromagnetic spectrum situational awareness and operations.Called SPEED -- Systems Planning, Engineering and Evaluation Device -- the system allows communications personnel to plan, model and analyze radio and jammer effects in a defined electromagnetic spectrum to overcome possible communications degradation or problems in interoperability.The software was originally developed for the Marine Corps by Northrop Grumman. An earlier version has been used by the Marines, other services within the U.S. Department of Defense and joint operations and other U.S. federal agencies since 1988. It has supported numerous joint operations and disaster response operations.The advanced Version 11.1.1 adds 3-D mapping and mission planning capabilities, including frequency-dependent rejection interference analysis, enhanced jammer modeling and effectiveness prediction."Northrop Grumman is proud of its development and advancement of this critical planning capability, particularly as the electromagnetic battlefield grows increasingly complex and the use of the electromagnetic spectrum becomes increasingly essential to warfighters," said Mike Twyman, sector vice president and general manager of the Defense Systems division for Northrop Grumman Information Systems. "This recent software release is especially important because it represents significant advancements in both front-end user experience and back-end modeling and simulation. This software provides critical integrated functionality that can support both Marine Corps and Army spectrum management and electronic warfare requirements."The new version software is now a government off-the-shelf product available to government agencies.

DAVIS, Calif., Dec. 26 (UPI) -- Veterinarians in California said a dog credited with saving two girls from being struck by a motorcycle is getting closer to receiving reconstructive surgery.University of California-Davis veterinarians said Kabang, a 2-year-old dog who lost her muzzle in last year's motorcycle crash, successfully underwent chemotherapy for the tumors that delayed her facial surgery, The Sacramento Bee reported Wednesday.The vets said Kabang is now undergoing heartworm treatment before the reconstructive efforts can begin."Kabang begins her third week of 'bed rest' following her first heartworm treatment," a Dec. 18 update on the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital's website said. "This will continue for about another three weeks. She is eager to go outside and play, but is accepting her needed rest well."Kabang was brought to the UC Davis hospital in October. The money for her care was raised via fundraising efforts on social media sites.

CUPERTINO, Calif., Sept. 21 (UPI) -- A market analyst predicted U.S. technology giant Apple will sell 6 million iPhones by Monday, including 3 million of the cheaper iPhone 5C model.Gene Munster at Piper Jaffray, said he expects Apple will sell out of the more expensive iPhone 5S.Apple, for the first time, has introduced an array of new colors for the iPhone, which launched Friday. The company has also introduced a cheaper version that comes in a plastic casing.The more expensive 5S has an upgraded camera and a faster processor, and includes a new security system that relies on fingerprints to identify the owner, CNN reported Saturday.The metal-backed 5S comes in gold, silver and "space gray," while the plastic-backed model comes in a variety of colors, CNN said.Gold has proven to be the hands-down favorite color among purchasers of the high-end model. It is already listed online as not available until October, while the silver and "space gray" models can still be shipped in seven to 10 business days.News outlets in China report the gold model has already sold out in China."It's new and shiny," said college student Chance Shafor, 22, who was the first in line at an Apple store outside of Atlanta Friday morning.Gold-colored means colored aluminum, but consumers can shell out $35,000 for an actual 18K gold-plated iPhone 5 from luxury retailer Stuart Hughes, CNN said.CNN did not say whether that model was sold out.

HARTBERG, Austria, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- A writer who claims the Nazi gas chambers were a fiction has been arrested in Austria on a 16-year-old warrant.David Irving was picked up in Hartberg after police received a tip that he was in the country, the Times of London reported. He had gone to Austria to address a far-right group.Irving was considered a serious historian of the Nazi era until 1988, when he first emerged as a Holocaust denier. In 2000, he lost a libel suit in London when a judge found that he had falsified history. He has also been fined in Germany.

BOGOTA, March 6 (UPI) -- Colombian authorities say they have apprehended four suspected members of the revolutionary guerrilla group known as FARC.Authorities told Colombia Reports Tuesday the four were captured following a battle between Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and the Colombian Army's 15th Brigade in the village of La Luisa in the western part of the South American country.Those arrested included one of FARC's guerrilla leaders, a logistics head and a female supporter of the network.In addition to the arrests, the army recovered rifles, anti-personal mines, ammunition and uniforms.The arrests followed a freeze in civil activity imposed by the rebel group last week. Officials speculate the strike is a show of force by FARC, which seeks a stronger position in any future peace negotiations with the Colombian government.

MOSCOW, Sept. 7 (UPI) -- Russian officials are doubtful of President Barack Obama's claim that he will have more "flexibility" if he wins a second term, analysts say.Obama made the assertion earlier this year regarding negotiations with Russia over a proposed missile defense shield, RIA Novosti reported Friday.Meeting with Russia's then-President Dmitry Medvedev earlier this year, Obama said, "After my election, I have more flexibility." The remark was picked up by a microphone and broadcast by news media around the world.Obama is a "sincere man" who "sincerely wants to implement positive change," newly elected President Vladimir Putin told state-owned television network RT earlier this week."But can he do it, will they let him do it?," Putin asked.Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has called Russia America's number one enemy.Both Obama and Putin are trying to "reset" the state of relations that existed before President George W. Bush, said Alexei Pushkov, head of the international affairs committee in Russia's lower house of parliament.Pushkov predicted "relations will be more complicated and not nearly as warm as they were portrayed three years ago" when the "reset" policy was announced.The "reset" policy is viewed by Russian officials as a course correction that's already done, commented Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University."The question from the Russian side is: Where do we go from here?" Stent said. Moscow sees the United States needing cooperation from Russia on issues such as Afghanistan more than Russia needs the United States, she added.What Russia wants more is investment by major U.S. businesses, said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. If that were to happen, relations between the two countries would be smoothed considerably, he said.

JERUSALEM, Nov. 17 (UPI) -- Israel and Saudi Arabia are working on contingency plans for a possible military strike on Iran, a Sunday Times report said.The British newspaper reported the two countries are working on plans for a possible strike on Iran's nuclear facilities if a a deal struck by the P5 plus1 countries in Geneva later this week fails to significantly curb Iran's nuclear program. Israel's intelligence agency Mossad is reportedly working with Saudi officials on the plans."Once the Geneva agreement is signed, the military option will be back on the table. The Saudis are furious and are willing to give Israel all the help it needs," a diplomatic source told the newspaper.In the framework of cooperation between the two countries, Riyadh has given Jerusalem a green light to use its airspace in the event of a military strike on Iran, the newspaper said.Both countries are alarmed by Iran's nuclear ambitions, the report added.Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been appealing to Western audiences to oppose an agreement with Iran, Haaretz said. Netanyahu Sunday said there is still time to change an agreement with Iran that will bring about a far better diplomatic solution. Netanyahu said Iran is still suffering from the effects of economic sanctions imposed by the West, Israel Radio said. It is the Israeli government's obligation to stand firmly against a bad agreement in the making with Iran, he said.In recent weeks, Netanyahu has been interviewed by a number of international networks and spoken out against a deal that would leave Iran's nuclear program intact, saying such an agreement will directly threaten Israel's survival. Netanyahu's stand on the matter has put him at loggerheads with the Obama administration, which continues to push for an agreement to be signed in Geneva when the P5 plus1 countries -- United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany -- reconvene later this week to discuss a deal with the Islamic Republic.

Wiki
Stanley Tucci (born November 11, 1960) is an American actor, writer, film producer and film director. He has been nominated for several notable film awards, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for his performance in The Lovely Bones (2009).
Tucci, an Italian American, was born in Peekskill, New York, the son of Joan (née Tropiano), a retired secretary and writer, and Stanley Tucci, Sr., a retired high school art teacher. His sister is actress Christine Tucci, and his cousin is the screenwriter Joseph Tropiano. He grew up in Katonah, New York and attended John Jay High School. Tucci played on the John Jay soccer team and baseball teams, however, his main interest lay in the school's drama club, where he and fellow actor and high school buddy, Campbell Scott, son of actor George C. Scott, gave well-received performances at many of John Jay's drama club productions. Tucci attended SUNY Purchase and completed his B.F.A. degree after four years in the school's Conservatory of Theatre Arts.
Tucci made his Broadway debut in The Queen and the Rebels on 30 September 1982. His film debut was in Prizzi's Honor (1985). Tucci is known for his work in films such as The Pelican Brief, Kiss of Death, Road to Perdition and Big Night, and in the television series Murder One as the mysterious Richard Cross. Big Night (1996), which he co-wrote with his cousin Joseph Tropiano, starred in, and co-directed with Campbell Scott, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film also featured his sister Christine and mother, who wrote a cookbook for the film. It won him and Tropiano the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. He's typically cast in supporting roles such as the sidekick or the villain, but has had the lead in two films, both romantic comedies: A Modern Affair (1995) and The Whole Shebang (2001).
