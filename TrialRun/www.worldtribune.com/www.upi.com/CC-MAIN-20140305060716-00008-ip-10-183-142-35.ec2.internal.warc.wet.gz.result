CALGARY, Alberta, July 29 (UPI) -- Keystone XL pipeline planner TransCanada said it was contesting President Obama's claims made against the project in an interview with The New York Times.TransCanada aims to build Keystone XL to facilitate the delivery of heavy Canadian crude oil to U.S. refineries. A portion of the pipeline from Oklahoma is under construction, though a presidential permit is needed for the cross-border section.Obama said in an interview published Saturday by The New York Times there was "no evidence" the project would create as many jobs as its supporters claim."The most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two, and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people," he said.James Millar, a spokesman for TransCanada, challenged Obama's position in an email statement, saying the domestic section has already put 4,000 people to work."It is not logical to think a $7.6 billion infrastructure project stretching across the entire breadth of the continental U.S. wouldn't employ thousands of workers both in the manufacturing sector and in constructing the pipeline," he said.Obama said earlier this year he'd weigh the pipeline against its environmental footprint. Canadian oil is viewed as more carbon-intensive to produce than conventional crude, though TransCanada says the environmental consequences are minimal.

| License Photo	ORILLIA, Ontario, Oct. 2 (UPI) -- Government and casino officials say British comedian Russell Brand's tweets about being denied entry to Canada were not true.Michael Patton, spokesman for Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. via e-mail Sunday that the Canada Border Services Agency did not bar Brand from crossing the U.S.-Canadian border."Apparently he had aircraft problems and was making a joke," Patton said.Casino Rama in Orillia, Ontario, where Brand was to perform, said the comic was in California and his private jet was experiencing problems.Brand had posted on Twitter Saturday that his show at Casino Rama had to be postponed, the CBC said."I'm sorry. I can't enter Canada. We must abolish the borders between our nations AND our minds," Brand, 36, posted.Earlier Saturday, Brand tweeted: "HELP! I'm gonna be late for Casino Rama show unless someone can force Canadian customs officials to let us land in Orillia!"In May, the performer, last seen in the remake of "Arthur," was deported from Japan while visiting his wife and pop star Katy Perry because of prior convictions.Brand, a heroin addict in recovery, has numerous arrests under his belt, including one for allegedly assaulting a photographer.

| License Photo	TORONTO, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Former NHL stars Steve Yzerman, Brett Hull, Brian Leetch and Luc Robitalle led the class of 2009 inductees Monday into the Hockey Hall of Fame.Also joining the hall -- in the "builder" category -- was Lou Lamoriella, chief executive officer, president and general manager of the New Jersey Devils.Yzerman, a nine-time all-star, led the Detroit Red Wings to three Stanley Cup championships."I need to thank the NHL for allowing me and all of the players to ply our trade," Yzerman said at the induction ceremony in Toronto. "I was fortunate to play with some of the greatest players ever, as is witnessed by the other three I am sharing this night with. There have been some great players over the history of the league, and to be considered in the same class as those guys really humbles me."Hull, an eight-time all-star who played for Calgary, St. Louis, Dallas, Detroit and Phoenix, joined his father, Bobby Hull, in the hall.Leetch, twice named the league's top defenseman, played for the New York Rangers, Toronto and Boston. Robitaille was the highest-scoring left wing in NHL history. He played for the Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh, the New York Rangers and Detroit.

KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 7 (UPI) -- A committee of women in Afghanistan began a petition drive calling for a nationwide end to a decades-long state of conflict, the U.N. mission in Kabul said.The Women's Committee within the Afghan High Peace Council is trying to get 300,000 signatures for peace, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported Thursday"To end the current bloodshed and establish nationwide peace and unity, we call on the government, armed opposition groups and the international community to participate in peace talks and urge the conflicting parties to declare a cease-fire and to reach peace," the committee's petition says.With Afghan forces taking on more responsibility for their nation's security, international forces that helped overthrow the Taliban-led government in 2001 are ending combat operations this year.The women's campaign runs through Feb. 19.Jan Kubis, U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, said Wednesday the role of women in political processes is a benchmark of democratic success in the country.Presidential and provincial council elections are scheduled in April. There are no women running for president but more than 10 percent of the 2,700 candidates for provincial council are women.

PITTSBURGH, March 17 (UPI) -- A Pittsburgh police officer was shot in both legs after a traffic stop turned violent Sunday, a police spokeswoman said. Two police officers were on patrol when they made a traffic stop at 3:43 a.m. in a parking lot in East Liberty, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said. Four occupants were in the vehicle, the police statement reads, and a passenger in the rear of the vehicle got out of the car and began to flee on foot.One officer pursued the man, while the other detained the three remaining occupants, the Post-Gazette said. "When the fleeing (suspect) could not escape, due to being in a fenced in area, the (suspect) turned toward the officer, pulled a weapon, and opened fire. Both officers returned fire."One of the officers was shot in both legs, and the suspect, identified as Dante Bonner, sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper torso. The injured officer is at UPMC Presbyterian in stable condition, and Bonner, 18, is in critical condition, the Post-Gazette said. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said the injured officer is a two-year veteran of the department, and the other officer is a four-year veteran.

March. 18 (UPI) -- After a long struggle with alcoholism, Jason Molina, the prolific singer-songwriter at the heart of indie bands Songs: Ohia and Magnolia Electric Co., died Saturday at the age of 39.In a statement released Monday, his label, Secretly Canadian, mourned the loss of a troubled artist.“Jason is the cornerstone of Secretly Canadian,” the statement said. “Without him there would be no us -- plain and simple.""His singular, stirring body of work is the foundation upon which all else has been constructed. After hearing and falling in love with the mysterious voice on his debut single 'Soul' in early 1996, we approached him about releasing a single on our newly formed label. For some reason he said yes. We drove from Indiana to New York to meet him in person and he handed us what would become the first of many JMo master tapes. And with the Songs: Ohia 'One Pronunciation of Glory' we were given a voice as a label."Molina began performing in 1996 with a rotating group of musicians under the name Songs: Ohia, releasing 10 albums and four EPs in a six-year span.He formed Magnolia Electric Co. in 2003, with whom he released another five albums.According to the label's statement, Molina withdrew from touring in 2009 to deal with severe alcoholism. His struggles with the disease became public in 2011 with the label and Molina's family pleaded with fans to help pay for his rehab bills.The statement said he died of natural causes.The whole statement from the label:
We are deeply saddened to announce that Jason Andrew Molina passed away in his home in Indianapolis this past Saturday, March 16th of natural causes at age 39. Jason was a world class musician, songwriter & recording artist. He was also a beloved friend. He first caught international attention in 1996 when he began releasing albums under the name Songs: Ohia. In 2003 he started the band Magnolia Electric Co. Between those two bands he released over a dozen critically-acclaimed albums and — starting in 1997 — he toured the world every year until he had to stop in 2009 to deal with severe alcoholism. Jason was incredibly humbled by his fans’ support through the years and said that the two most important words he could ever say are “Thank you.”This is especially hard for us to share. Jason is the cornerstone of Secretly Canadian. Without him there would be no us — plain and simple. His singular, stirring body of work is the foundation upon which all else has been constructed. After hearing and falling in love with the mysterious voice on his debut single “Soul” in early 1996, we approached him about releasing a single on our newly formed label. For some reason he said yes. We drove from Indiana to New York to meet him in person and he handed us what would become the first of many JMo master tapes. And with the Songs: Ohia One Pronunciation of Glory 7” we were given a voice as a label. The subsequent self-titled debut was often referred to by fans as The Black Album. Each Songs: Ohia album to follow proved a new, haunting thesis statement from a prodigal songwriter whose voice and soul burned far beyond that of the average twenty-something. There was organ-laced, sepia-toned econimica (1998’s Impala) and charred-hearted, free form balladry (1999’s Axxess and Ace). There were the dark glacial make-out epics of 2000’s The Lioness and the jungle incantations of 2000’s Ghost Tropic. There was the career-defining agnostic’s gospel of 2002’s Didn’t It Rain, an album about setting roots that also seemed to offer solace to a world that had recently seen its bar on terror raised. It was followed in 2003 by a thrilling about-face, the instant classic Magnolia Electric Co., which took Jason’s songwriting to ’70s classic rock heights. The move was such a powerful moment for Molina that Magnolia Electric Co. became the new moniker under which would perform until 2009. With Magnolia Electric Co., Jason found a brotherhood in his bandmates, with whom he built an incredible live experience and made a truly classic album in Josephine (2009).We’re going to miss Jason. He was generous. He was a one of a kind. And he had a voice unlike any other.Fans can contribute to Jason’s medical fund as a memorial gift by sending money via PayPal.Hold on, Magnolia, to that great highway moon
No one has to be that strong
But if you’re stubborn like me
I know what you’re trying to beHold on, Magnolia, I hear that station bell ring
You might be holding the last light I see
Before the dark finally gets a hold of meHold on, Magnolia, I know what a true friend you’ve been
In my life I have had my doubts
But tonight I think I’ve worked it out with all of themHold on, Magnolia, to the thunder and the rain
To the lightning that has just signed my name to the bottom lineHold on, Magnolia, I hear that lonesome whistle whine
Hold on, Magnolia, I think its almost time

Fort George G. Meade, located adjacent to Odenton, Maryland, in Anne Arundel County, is an active U.S. Army installation. The fort, established in 1917, is named for General George Gordon Meade, a Union Army general in the American Civil War. It covers 5,067 acres (20.51 km2) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.
Fort Meade is also home to Meade Senior High School, MacArthur Middle School, Meade Middle School and the National Cryptologic Museum.
Fort Meade was established in 1917 when the United States Department of War acquired 19,000 acres (77 km²) of land west of Odenton to develop a training camp. First known as Camp Annapolis Junction, the fort was named Camp Admiral at its opening in 1917. Other name changes occurred after construction of 1,460 buildings on the site when it became Camp George Gordon Meade then in the 1920s it became Fort Leonard Wood, but by the 1930s it reverted back to Fort George G. Meade.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
