| License Photo	ALLENTOWN, Pa., Oct. 1 (UPI) -- A heat wave this summer tested workers and management at an Amazon.com warehouse in Pennsylvania, witnesses said.Some workers lost their jobs in the heat wave that pushed temperatures in the warehouse above 100 degrees, the Allentown, Pa., Morning Call reported Saturday."I never felt like passing out in a warehouse and I never felt treated (as badly) in any other warehouse but this one," said Elmer Goris, 34, who quit his job in July over conditions and management's behavior, the newspaper said.Robert Rivas, 38, said he also quit his job when "the heat index got to really outrageous numbers."During one shift, Rivas said, the heat index inside the facility reached 114 degrees.Amazon said it was installing air conditioning at the warehouse that opened in 2010 and provides 900 to 2,000 jobs, depending on the season.Amazon also provided "free water, snacks, extra fans and cooled air during the summer," said warehouse general manager Vickie Mortimer.Another extra during heat waves: Paramedics were parked outside in ambulances during especially brutal heat, the newspaper said.Was that a sign the company went the extra mile to ensure the safety of their workers or a sign that the company knew it was pushing workers too far? The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, after an investigation, made several recommendations in August and the company complied, the Morning Call reported.Co-director of the National Employment Law Project Catherine Ruckelshaus warned that hot weather and a stumbling economy are a bad mix."They (Amazon) can get away with it because most workers will take whatever they can get with jobs few and far between," she said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UPI) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Wednesday he had notified Congress that civilian personnel could be furloughed if spending cuts proceed as planned.Congress and the White House have until March 1 to agree on a new spending plan or automatic, across the board spending cuts of $500 billion from the federal budget over 10 years will become law.Automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, would result in furloughs affecting "a vast majority" of the department's civilian personnel, Panetta said. He also said it would result in "severe damage ... both to this department and to our national defense."Stars and Stripes reported Wednesday that the plan is to place about 800,000 civilian personnel on furlough one day per week for 22 weeks, starting in late April and running through the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.The few exceptions include jobs that protect either life or property but even first responder personnel aren't entirely exempt, the newspaper said."That doesn't mean a wholesale protection of those jobs. They can still do minimum manning," said Pentagon spokeswoman U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins.Over the course of the year, the furloughs would result in a one-month loss of pay for those affected. Unlike previous department furloughs, there are no plans to make up that loss to the workers affected, Stars and Stripes reported.Panetta further lamented the spending cuts in a news release: "Our most important asset at the department is our world-class personnel. You are fighting every day to keep our country strong and secure, and rest assured that the leaders of this department will continue to fight with you and for you."

NEW YORK, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- The New York attraction Ripley's Believe it or Not! is having its first ever Black Friday sale, offering items including shrunken heads and penis sheaths.More than 70 bizarre, one-of-a-kind items are up for sale. Among them, an authentic 17th century vampire killing kit, a Dendroolithus dinosaur egg and a 16th century Iron Maiden priced at $2.5 million.The penis sheath variety pack -- there are five to collect -- is valued at $500, the New York Daily News reported."We all at some point during the gift giving season come across someone that you say to yourself, 'I have no idea what to get him,'" said Michael Hirsch, president and general manager of the Times Square attraction. "This is truly an opportunity to get something for someone that truly has everything."

COLLEGE PARK, Md., Sept. 5 (UPI) -- Forecasters expect the U.S. Labor Department to report Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in August and the unemployment rate remained steady at 7.4 percent.Although in line with the pace of recent months, recent jobs gains have been heavily weighted toward part-time positions.Since January, 936,000 additional Americans report working part-time, while only 27,000 more say they have obtained full-time positions. The shift to part-time workers, partially a reaction to Obamacare health insurance mandates, puts downward pressure on wages and benefits in low-paying industries, such as retailing and restaurants, and widens income inequality.Expectations of permanently slower growth are hardening disturbing changes in the structure of the labor market and social conditions. These days, new college graduates often work at unpaid internships while taking part-time jobs at places like Starbucks to meet minimal living expenses. And they are putting off marriage and childbearing, which also drags on consumer spending and growth.Adding in discouraged adults, who have quit looking for work altogether, and part-timers who want full-time employment, the unemployment rate becomes 14.0 percent. In the second quarter, gross domestic product growth was 2.5 percent, owing to an increase in business inventories, stronger exports and weaker imports.The boost from stronger U.S. sales abroad and fewer imports aren't expected to continue because of China's resurgent manufacturing and Japan's policy of targeting the U.S. auto industry and other manufacturers with an artificially cheap yen.Inventories can't grow forever and in the end consumers and business investment must pick up the slack.Despite greater optimism as expressed by consumers and small businesses in sentiment surveys, initial readings for third quarter consumer spending are quite weak, and growth in industrial production and manufacturing, as tracked by the Federal Reserve, have slowed. Consequently, economic growth may be expected to slide back to about 2 percent in the second half of the year.The protracted delay in determining appropriate U.S. military action in Syria has added to uncertainty and pushed up oil and gasoline prices. These will drag on consumer spending, business investment and jobs creation in the third quarter.Even with more full-time positions, the pace of jobs creation is well short of what is needed. About 360,000 jobs would lower unemployment to 6 percent over three years but that would require GDP growth in the range of 4-5 percent.Stronger growth is possible. Four years into the Reagan recovery, after a deeper recession than President Barack Obama inherited, GDP was advancing at a 5.1 percent annual pace, and jobs creation was quite robust.Factors contributing to the slow pace of recovery include the remaining large trade deficits on oil and manufactured products from China and elsewhere in Asia. Together, these are directly subtracting 4 million full-time jobs.Absent U.S. policies to develop more oil offshore and in Alaska and effectively confront Asian governments about their purposefully undervalued currencies and protectionism the trade deficit will continue to tax growth and steal U.S. jobs.Dodd-Frank regulations make mortgages, refinancing and home improvement loans much more difficult to obtain. Consequently, the recovery in housing construction, though welcomed, remains lackluster as compared to past recoveries. In turn, this slows expansion in building materials, major appliances, furniture and other durable goods.The high cost and slow pace of regulatory reviews are a constant complaint among businesses and curb investment spending and Washington shows no signs of listening.Regulations to protect the environment and accomplish other goals should be subject to the same efficacy standards the market applies to commercial technologies -- regulatory assessments and enforcement are needed but must be delivered cost effectively and quickly to add genuine value.Many businesses with overseas opportunities remain tentative about adding capacity and hiring workers in the United States. Instead, they look to Asia where government policies are more accommodating and prospects for growth remain stronger.Without better trade, energy and regulatory policies, the pace of jobs creation in the United States won't pick up.--(Peter Morici is an economist and professor at the Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, and a widely published columnist.

BOILING SPRINGS, S.C., March 25 (UPI) -- A South Carolina man kicked open a side door to a church Sunday and pointed a shotgun menacingly before worshipers grappled him to the floor, authorities said. No shots were fired in the harrowing incident at Boiling Springs' Southside Freewill Baptist Church, the Spartanburg Herald Journal reported.Police arrested Jesse Gates, 38, who also was carrying a hunting knife, and his sister, Angela Michelle Gates, 34, who drove him to the church, the newspaper said.The Rev. Henry Guyton said Gates had shown up before the service acting "like he was having a heart attack" and asking that someone call a television station. Guyton said he called 911 instead. Deputies and emergency medical services staff checked out Gates and he left the church, only to return with a shotgun, the Herald Journal said.Guyton's 26-year-old grandson Aaron was in a recreation building next door and saw Gates take the gun out of the trunk of a car."At that point, I knew I had to do something," the younger Guyton said. "I wanted to try to contain him outside."Aaron Guyton went in the church and locked the doors, but Gates forced his way inside where the church members took action. Jesse Smith and Leland Powers held the gunman down while Aaron Guyton, who has a conceal-carry permit, held a gun on him until deputies arrived, the newspaper said."The gun was loaded," Henry Guyton said. "I said, 'Jesse, what did you do it for?' He said, 'They took my children and won't let me see them.'"I'm glad the Lord took care of everything. The police did a good job too."Gates was charged with second-degree violent burglary, disturbing a place of worship, kidnapping, and three counts of pointing and presenting a firearm. Gates' sister was charged with accessory before the fact of a felony. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright commended Aaron Guyton for having a concealed weapons permit."We're very fortunate we didn't have gruesome scenes to work there," Wright said. "I like the fact that a concealed weapons permit holder was prepared to protect the worshipers."

Tornadic storms recharging in MidwestTULSA, Okla., April 15 (UPI) -- Tornadic thunderstorms were reorganizing from the Upper Midwest to the southern Plains following overnight storms that killed five, meteorologists say.Madison, Wis., and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, lie in the heart of the threat, where the potential is high for more tornadoes, Accuweather reported Sunday. At least five people are dead in Oklahoma after more than 100 reported tornadoes ravaged Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa late Saturday and early Sunday, the National Weather Service said.Five people died in Woodward, Okla. -- two children at a trailer park, two people near the Tangier area and one who died at the hospital, The Oklahoman reported. City Manager Alan Riffel said about 10 people are in critical condition.The Woodward News said some 3,900 homes in the city of 12,000 people were without power early Sunday.Keli Cain, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, said early reports from the area northeast of Oklahoma City were grim."We're hearing of what sounds to be significant damage in the area," she said.In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback declared a state of disaster emergency as twisters tore through the state late Saturday.In Iowa, emergency officials told The New York Times 75 percent of the town of Thurman was obliterated by a tornado Saturday.By early Sunday morning, about 7,000 homes were without power throughout Iowa, the Des Moines Register reported. The town of Creston was struck Saturday night, with Greater Regional Medical Center and Southwestern Community College both sustaining damage.Attacks on Kabul defeated; meaning unclearKABUL, Afghanistan, April 15 (UPI) -- The commander of Western forces in Afghanistan said officials were analyzing the significance of Sunday's blunted Taliban raid on Kabul.Guerrillas overran a major hotel in the city and attacked diplomatic compounds, including the U.S. Embassy, but were by and large driven off by the end of the day.The Taliban announced the attacks were part of a major spring offensive; however, U.S. Gen. John Allen said in a written statement the circumstances were still being scrutinized. "No one is underestimating the seriousness of today's attacks, and we'll work hard to determine the circumstances that led to today's events," said Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force. Afghan security officials said in a written statement that the attacks were "ineffective" and said about 13 militants had been killed and 15 captured, including two alleged suicide bombers who were nabbed before they could reach their targets.Allen credited the skills of Afghan security forces in quelling the attacks, and said the attacks were a sign the Taliban was losing its ability to prevent Afghanistan from stabilizing.U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker went so far as to question whether the attacks were even the work of the Taliban or rather the Haddaqi terror network. "The Taliban are very good at issuing statements, less good at fighting," he told CNN.Syria bombards rebel posts in HomsDAMASCUS, Syria, April 15 (UPI) -- The Syrian military pounded the western city of Homs with artillery Sunday in a bid to roust pro-democracy rebels, human rights officials said.Although the government of President Bashar Assad has permitted few journalists into the country since rebellion began in January 2011, a report Sunday from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in London said there was "widespread mortar and heavy machine gunfire," Voice of America reported.The group said in a release from London artillery shells were being fired into Homs at a rate of three per minute.There was no report of fatalities or casualties, although the United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died as a result of the political upheaval since last year.Meanwhile, the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously authorized the deployment of 30 unarmed monitors to Syria, with an option to deploy as many as 200 more.In Geneva, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there would be a U.N. summit there April 20 to address how to deal with at least 1 million people displaced by the violence in Syria.Pakistan pursues hundreds of escapeesISLAMABAD, Pakistan, April 15 (UPI) -- Pakistani officials said they launched a dragnet Sunday after nearly 400 prisoners were freed in a Taliban raid on a prison in Bannu.About 30 of the 384 inmates who fled the lockup were back in custody as Pakistani authorities rallied from the brazen large-scale attack."This is the largest jailbreak in Pakistan's history," Malik Naveed Khan, a former police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told The New York Times. "It's a very serious failure."Officials said about 100 Taliban fighters traveling in pickup trucks forced their way into the prison in order to rescue a former commander who had attempted to assassinate President Pervez Musharraf. Sources told the Times the guards offered little resistance, causing no casualties among the Taliban and only a few injuries among the staff."Such a large number of people barging into a jail in the middle of the night raises serious questions," said Khan.Police responded by shutting down cell phone service in the area. It was believed the militants who fled -- their number remained unclear -- were likely headed to the neighboring Taliban stronghold of North Waziristan, the Times said.

| License Photo	BOSTON, April 25 (UPI) -- The FBI told New York officials the Boston Marathon bombing suspects planned to travel to New York City and detonate explosives in Times Square."Last night, we were informed by the FBI that the surviving attacker revealed that New York City was next on their list of targets," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday at a news conference."He told the FBI apparently that he and his brother had intended to drive to New York and detonate additional explosives in Times Square. They had built these additional explosives and we know they had the capacity to carry out the attacks."The newspaper said the information came from questioning of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in his hospital room.Tsarnaev told investigators he and his brother needed more gas for the car they were in, forcing them to stop at a gas station and allowing police officers to catch up to them.Several media outlets also quoted unnamed sources as saying Tsarnaev told investigators the brothers had targeted Times Square. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a confrontation with police. His brother Dzhokhar, 19, has told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off more explosive devices but ended up throwing them at police instead, sources told The New York Post.New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday information from the brothers showed they may have intended to go to New York to "party."The Post said the FBI told state officials about the New York link Thursday.One gun -- a semiautomatic handgun -- has been recovered from the two men suspected of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings, police told ABC News.The gun, presumably used by Tamerlan Tsarnaev was recovered at the shootout scene in Watertown, Mass., and is in the custody of the Massachusetts State Police, ABC News reported Thursday.No guns were recovered from the boat in the back yard where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured Friday after an intense manhunt. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed earlier Friday.Law enforcement sources said the recovered gun was a Ruger 9mm semiautomatic handgun and the serial number had been obliterated.The apparent lack of firearms led some officials to theorize the brothers' fatal attack on Sean Collier, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, was an attempt to arm themselves, officials said.Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon April 15. Recent figures indicate 34 people were still hospitalized, one listed in critical condition, ABC News said.Law enforcement officials told ABC News Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently began collecting materials for the explosives at least two months ago when he was spotted at a New Hampshire fireworks store. Store personnel told the FBI $400 worth of fireworks were sold to him in February.U.S. officials also said the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service contacted the CIA and the FBI about Tamerlan Tsarnaev.The older Tsarnaev brother "had changed drastically since 2010" and was preparing to travel to a part of Russia "to join unspecified underground groups," said a one-page request from the intelligence service, cited by The New York Times, that was sent to the FBI in March 2011 and to the CIA in September 2011.U.S. authorities told Russian intelligence they had no suspicious information about the man but they put Tamerlan Tsarnaev on two government watch lists late that year that were supposed to alert authorities if he traveled overseas.One of the databases, the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, contains about 700,000 names and is the source for information for other government watch lists -- including the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database and the Transportation Security Administration's "no fly" list.When Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the United States Jan. 12, 2012, for a six-month trip to Dagestan and Chechnya -- predominantly Muslim republics in Russia's North Caucasus region -- his flight reservation tripped a security alert to customs authorities, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate committee Tuesday.It evidently did not set off a TIDE alert because the spelling variants of his name and the birth dates entered into the system -- variants Russia included in its warnings -- were different enough from the correct information to bypass an alert, a U.S. official told the Times.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been the subject of a massive manhunt all day Friday and was cornered just before nightfall, hiding in a boat in the driveway of a house in Watertown."They probably didn't know whether he had a gun," one law enforcement official told The Washington Post. "Hours earlier, he and his brother had killed a police officer, shot another officer and thrown explosives out of their cars as the police were chasing them. They couldn't assume that he did not have a gun and more explosives."

NEW DELHI, Dec. 29 (UPI) -- Protests broke out in India Saturday after the death of a 23-year-old woman who was gang-raped in New Delhi, officials said.The victim, whose name has yet to be released, died early Saturday at a hospital in Singapore where she was taken for special treatment, the BBC reported.About 4,000 people protested in New Delhi Saturday, despite a government order banning gatherings of more than five people after previous protests over the crime became violent. Protesters came together at the Jantar Mantar observatory, which is not covered by the ban.One protester, Poonam Kaushik, blamed the attack on "the government's inefficiency to ensure safety of women in Delhi" and said the victim's death would generate "even more anger.""We don't want your condolences! We don't want your fake sentiments! We demand immediate action to strengthen the laws against sexual violence," said one sign at the protest.President Pranab Mukherjee called the gang-rape victim a "brave daughter of India" as her family made preparations for her funeral.The 23-year-old university student's body was to be flown to Delhi from Singapore on a chartered jet Saturday afternoon, Press Trust of India reported. T.C.A. Raghavan, the Indian high commissioner to Singapore, said her family had not yet decided on her last rites.Raghavan said the family told him they hoped her death would lead to changes making India safer for women. Meanwhile, on Friday, one of the six suspects in the case was remanded to judicial custody for 12 days, the Press Trust of India reported."[Akshay Singh] is remanded to judicial custody. Let he be produced on January 9," the court said.Singh was ordered held to allow investigators more time to collect evidence.

After Monday's Magic vs. Pacers basketball game, sports commentators Isaiah Thomas and Chris Webber discussed several important issues during their post-game play-by-play. Among them, was the story of the couple who was seen "arguing" on the stands over some delicious-looking mint chocolate chip ice cream.A young bearded man and -- who we can only assume was his girlfriend -- were captured by the cameras watching the game accompanied by a large cone filled with several scoops of chocolate chip ice cream. As the commentators point out, the man, whom they dubbed "Ice Cream Guy," was very focused on the game while enjoying his ice cream cone when the woman approached the frozen treat with a plastic spoon to get a taste.Having purchased the treat for himself, after she probably passed on getting one for herself earlier, Ice Cream Guy pulls it away from her repeatedly, getting her to make this "oh-no-you-didn't" face. Since the clip of the commentators narrating Ice Cream Guy's predicament was posted on the NBA's YouTube page it went viral and now he and his alleged girlfriend are Internet celebrities.

Wiki
Barbara Eden (born Barbara Jean Morehead; August 23, 1934) is an American film and television actress and singer who is best known for her starring role in the sitcom I Dream of Jeannie.
Eden was born Barbara Jean Morehead in Tucson, Arizona, the daughter of Alice Mary (née Franklin) and Hubert Henry Morehead. Her parents divorced when she was three; she and her mother Alice moved to San Francisco where later her mother married Harrison Connor Huffman, a telephone lineman. The Great Depression deeply affected the Huffman family, and as they were unable to afford many luxuries, Barbara's mother entertained the children by singing songs. This musical background left a lasting impression on the actress, who began taking acting classes because she felt it might help her improve her singing.
Her first public performance was singing in the church choir. She was always doing the solos. When she was 14 she was singing in local bands for $10 a night in night clubs. At age 16 she became a member of Actor's Equity.She studied singing at the Conservatory of Music in San Francisco and acting with the Elizabeth Holloway School of Theatre. She graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco in 1949 and studied theater for one year at City College of San Francisco. Then she was elected Miss San Francisco in 1951. Barbara also entered the Miss California pageant, but did not win.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
