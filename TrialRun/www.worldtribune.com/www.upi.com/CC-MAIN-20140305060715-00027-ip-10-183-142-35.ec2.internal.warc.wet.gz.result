SOFIA, Bulgaria, July 5 (UPI) -- Greek President Karolos Papoulias wants to establish joint energy projects with Bulgaria.Papoulias discussed the potential for energy cooperation with visiting Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev during his two-day official state visit to Athens.Papoulias is especially interesting in accelerating construction of the Bulgarian-Greek gas interconnection, a pipeline designed to link the natural gas supply systems of the two nations.During a joint news conference with Plevneliev, Papoulias said: "Greece believes it is extremely important to encourage the Bulgarian-Greek cooperation in all large-scale energy projects. We have agreed that our future and that of our neighbors, especially in the Western Balkans, lies with the European Union. Further strengthening and encouragement of our cooperation with friendly Bulgaria is important. The spirit of solidarity and understanding that underlies the relations between our two nations, especially in a time of crisis, is an example of cooperation between friendly and neighboring countries," Novinte news agency reported Wednesday.Plevneliev remarked, "The gas interconnection between Bulgaria and Greece is of major importance for Bulgaria's energy diversification since at present we are dependent on the supplies of natural gas via Ukraine."

ATHENS, Greece, March 18 (UPI) -- Researchers investigating cardiovascular health say a cup of boiled Greek coffee may be why the inhabitants of Ikaria, a Greek island, live to age 90 and older.Dr. Gerasimos Siasos of the University of Athens Medical School said only 0.1 percent of Europeans live to be age 90 and older, yet on the Greek island of Ikaria, the figure was 1 percent -- one of the highest longevity rates anywhere. In addition, the islanders tend to live out their longer lives in good health, Siasos said.From a sample of 673 Ikarians age 65 and older who lived on the island permanently, the researchers randomly selected 71 men and 71 women to take part in the study. The researchers checked for high blood pressure, diabetes and other medical conditions and questioned them on their health, lifestyles and coffee drinking. They also checked the participants' endothelial function. The endothelium is a layer of cells that lines blood vessels, which is affected both by aging and by lifestyle habits such as smoking. The researchers investigated all types of coffee taken by participants -- but 87 percent consumed boiled, Greek coffee daily. The study, published in Vascular Medicine, found those consuming mainly boiled Greek coffee had better endothelial function than those who consumed other types of coffee. "Boiled Greek type of coffee, which is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants and contains only a moderate amount of caffeine, seems to gather benefits compared to other coffee beverages," Siasos said in a statement.

INDIANAPOLIS, May 11 (UPI) -- It appears success in the Indianapolis 500 has come easily for Helio Castroneves, but his pole-winning performance in Sunday's qualifying came in the most difficult of conditions.With cold temperatures and high wind gusts buffeting the cars around the 2.5-mile oval, Castroneves was able to run his fastest laps of the month to put his Marlboro Team Penske Dallara/Toyota on the pole with a four-lap average of 231.725 miles per hour."When Helio got up this morning, it was so windy he didn't think he could pass a rookie test -- that's how bad the wind was," said team owner Roger Penske, who scored his record 12th career Indy 500 pole to go along with a record 12 victories."But we checked with the airport weather office and saw that it was going to be dry all day, so rather than go out in conditions we didn't like, we decided to wait." Penske Racing played the waiting game and Castroneves was able to set the car up to the adverse conditions. Castroneves put together consecutive laps of 231.673 miles per hour followed by 232.215, 231.486 and 231.529 for a four-lap average at 231.725. "It just seems that this place, all the time, seems to be good for me," Castroneves said. "This is the place to take a chance. The result shows how hard I worked to get here. This is an incredible place and I couldn't be happier today."It's one of the happiest days in my life. That's why I'm crying. These moments are what I'll never forget. This moment is very special for me."Castroneves knocked his boyhood pal, Tony Kanaan, off the pole. Kanaan, driving for Andretti/Green Racing, ran a four-lap average of 231.006 mph in a Dallara/Honda. He also got revenge one day after Kanaan put a birthday cake in Castroneves' face during a television interview on the driver's 28th birthday. "Don't get me angry," Castroneves said of Kanaan with a laugh. "We were watching those other guys try to deal with the windy conditions and Gil de Ferran and I both agreed, let's not watch this, let's watch cartoons." While the windy conditions were enough to frighten the more fearless of drivers, Castroneves was able to have the machismo when it mattered the most. Robby Gordon, another driver for Andretti/Green Racing, was third with a four-lap average of 230.205 mph to round out the first row. Scott Dixon (230.099), rookie Dan Wheldon (229.958) and Kenny Brack (229.509) fill out the second row. Twenty-four drivers qualified on Sunday for the 33-car starting lineup, leaving nine spots open for next Sunday's final round of qualifications. Sarah Fisher is currently the slowest driver in the field with a four-lap average of 224.170 mph. It was Castroneves's ninth career Indy car pole and his first at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Penske Racing has won from the pole five times at the Indianapolis 500, but it was the team's first Indy 500 pole since 1994 when Al Unser Jr. won both the pole and the race. That has put him in position to become the first driver in racing history to win the Indianapolis 500 three straight years from the most coveted starting spot on the grid. "I remember my first year, we just wanted to put this baby in the grid," Castroneves said of his first race here in 2001. "The following year, we were able to try to attempt for the pole, we didn't get it. This year, we were just trying to work patiently ourselves to get a good speed, and all of a sudden we end up on pole." Even after he had put his car on the pole earlier in the qualifications, Kanaan knew that with the two Penske cars yet to qualify, that it wasn't time to celebrate the biggest pole of his career. "Penske's still out there," Kanaan said. "They're going to be tough to beat. And especially, I know those two guys really well, and they're not going to hold anything back." Kanaan's suspicions were right as Marlboro Team Penske used their understanding of the weather conditions and how it affects the ever-changing condition of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval to put Castroneves on top of the huge scoring pylon that is a Speedway landmark. "I think the key what we did today is to have a team and a driver that are patient," said Penske Racing president Tim Cindric. "It takes a lot of patience to sit there and watch the weather go by, watch these guys put their numbers on the board and wonder when it's going to be your turn. Really, that was the biggest thing for us, just tweaking the car a little bit at a time, then deciding when it was the right time to go."The right time was at 5:36 p.m. EDT, when Castroneves wheeled his Dallara/Toyota onto the track with 58 degree temperatures and winds blowing at 26 miles an hour. "You have to have a guy you have confidence in, especially on a day like today," Cindric said. "The more you run the more risk you take. To have the confidence that he'll keep the thing off the fence when you get ready for this, and know your team has the other car ready to go, really gives you the confidence to go hang it out there and see what happens."Cindric admitted with such diabolical weather conditions, the team actually thought "let's get this thing in the show and go home."

EDMONTON, Alberta, April 25 (UPI) -- Corey Crawford came on in relief to stop all 14 shots he faced Wednesday and the Chicago Blackhawks beat Edmonton 4-1 to clinch the Presidents' Trophy.The Blackhawks will win the trophy -- for having the best regular-season record in the NHL -- for the first time in 22 years.Chicago opened the season by earning a point in 24 consecutive games (21-0-3) and has 75 points with two contests remaining. The Blackhawks had lost their previous two games.Ray Emery, who has a 16-1 record this season with a 1.91 goals-against average, started in goal but left in the opening period with a lower body injury.Emery has made a case to be the starting Chicago goalie when the playoffs open although Crawford has seen more action than Emery during the regular season.Nail Yakupov scored against Emery 4:50 into the game to create a 1-1 tie, but Patrick Kane put a wrist shot past Devan Dubnyk less than 4 minutes later for the game-winner.It remained a 2-1 game until Johnny Oduya gave the Blackhawks some breathing room 4:36 into the third.Patrick Sharp scored into an empty net with 1:42 remaining.Dubnyk allowed three goals on 28 shots.

WASHINGTON, April 16 (UPI) -- A survey says U.S. young adults are less likely than older people to speak up if the driver of a vehicle in which they're riding is text messaging.The U.S. Department of Transportation said Monday passengers ages 18-20 were the least likely to say something to a driver who is texting or talking on a cellphone while behind the wheel.Since distracted drivers are often in the same age group, the DOT said it was initiating a public relations campaign to encourage passengers to remind their friends to keep their eyes and minds on the road."Distracted driving is an epidemic on our roadways, and these new findings show that our youngest drivers are particularly at risk," Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood said in a written statement. "We are encouraging young people across America to … speak up if the driver in their car is distracted."DOT surveyed 6,000 people and found 90 percent considered texting while driving unsafe. Only a third of respondents in the 18-20 age range said they would say something about it to the multitasking driver.DOT said it was holding a contest for the public to design a distracted-driving logo that will be available for use on Twitter, Facebook and other social media channels. Displaying the logo on messages will act as a reminder to the recipients who happen to be behind the wheel they should be watching the road, not a smart phone.

| License Photo	GALESBURG, Ill., July 24 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama, in a speech Wednesday at a small college in Illinois, accused congressional Republicans of putting the economy at risk."With an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball," Obama said. "And I am here to say this needs to stop. Short-term thinking and stale debates are not what this moment requires. Our focus must be on the basic economic issues that the matter most to you -- the people we represent. And as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class could not be higher."Obama aides said the speech at Knox College in Galesburg, which the president visited as a newly elected U.S. senator, was the first in a series intended to shape the debate over the federal budget this fall.Obama blamed Republican polices of tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich, and other changes hurting the poor and middle-class, for growing inequality that he said contributed to the recent recession.He acknowledged the recovery is fragile."The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy will lose the competition for good jobs and high living standards," he said. "That's why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation and information networks. That's what we need to be talking about. That's what Washington needs to be focused on."Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on the floor of the House that Obama, instead of giving speeches should approve the Keystone XL pipeline and put off implementation of parts of the Affordable Care Act, The Hill reported."The president himself said it isn't going to change any minds," Boehner said. "So what exactly will change? What's the point? What's it going to accomplish? You probably got the answer -- nothing. It's a hollow shell. It's an Easter egg with no candy in it."Obama was to follow his address with another one, on a slightly different topic, around 4:20 p.m. CDT at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, the White House said.The university's new Missouri Innovation Campus has a program that lets high school students go through a high-tech, accelerated curriculum on campus, cutting time and costs without increasing student debt.

| License Photo	PARIS, April 3 (UPI) -- France's president promised Wednesday to require Cabinet officials to disclose all assets after a former budget minister was indicted for tax fraud.In a televised statement, French President Francois Hollande said the law, which would mandate all government ministers to publish details of their financial assets, would be proposed "in the coming weeks."The announcement came a day after former Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac admitted he had a secret bank account.He resigned two weeks ago after an investigation was begun into the allegations. Cahuzac said in a blog post he set up the account 20 years ago."Jerome Cahuzac lied," Hollande said in his statement, which was recorded and broadcast after he left for a state visit to Morocco.He said the minister wouldn't receive any special protection from the government.Under Hollande's proposal, Parliament members convicted of fraud and corruption would be banned for life from holding public office. The legal system also would be reformed, the president said, to restore confidence in magistrates.Marine Le Pen, leader of the Front National, termed the potential legislation "petty measures."She called on the government to resign, saying, "beyond this Cahuzac affair, the list [of scandals] is too long."

(UPI) --Late Night With Jimmy Fallon spent a week honoring Pearl Jam with covers by Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, The Avett Brothers, Fleet Foxes singer Robin Pecknold, Dierks Bentley and house band The Roots. But Pearl Jam fans finally got to see the iconic 1990s rock band perform two songs of their new album -- "Sirens" and title track "Lightening Bolt." Eddie Vedder also sat down for a chat with Fallon and actor Javier Bardem to discuss the band's new album as well as "Balls in Your Mouth," their quirky duet from 2011.
