WASHINGTON, July 13 (UPI) -- A U.S. advocacy group said it filed requests to find out whether business interests influenced a decision in support of Shell in Nigeria.Washington in June filed a brief stating its partial support for Shell in a case claiming violations of international law by the company in Nigeria. The White House said, in Kiobel vs. Royal Dutch Petroleum, that the Alien Tort Statute shouldn't be applied.Advocacy group EarthRights International announced it filed three Freedom of Information Act requests seeking information about whether the possible business interests of Cabinet-level officials swayed the government's decision in the Kiobel case."If disclosed, this information will help reveal whether or not the business interests of Attorney General Eric Holder or Deputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan influenced the government's position in Kiobel," the group stated.A brief authored by the Justice Department, the group said, was "legally deficient." The Justice Department brief argued the U.S. judicial system wasn't available to alleged victims of human rights abuses involving a foreign company."Prior to joining the government, both Holder and Srinivasan represented companies that were subject to lawsuits similar to Kiobel," explained EarthRights lawyer Jonathan Kaufman in a statement.Shell is accused of causing massive environmental damage in parts of Nigeria. The U.N. Environment Program last year said it would likely take 30 years to clean up oil spilled in the region. Shell is accused of underestimating the volume of oil spilled, though it blames most of the spills on oil bandits.

| License Photo	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Aug. 5 (UPI) -- U.S. actress Meryl Streep says she tried to capture the spirit of, not impersonate, Julia Child, the iconic chef she plays in her new film, "Julie & Julia." The movie intertwines the story of Child's blossoming career as a chef, author and television personality with Julie Powell's blog and book about how she committed to cooking all of the recipes in Child's revolutionary 1961 tome, "Mastering the Art of French Cooking.""Well, I bet everybody in this room could do their version of Julia Child," Streep said at a recent press conference in White Plains, N.Y."To everybody, that voice was so familiar and then how do we know whether we're doing her or Dan Aykroyd's version of her (from 'Saturday Night Live')? Everyone can pull that 'bon appetit' out there," Streep said.The two-time Oscar winner then recalled how she thought the screenplay writer-director Nora Ephron gave her a year or so ago was "so, so beautifully written.""I thought that it was an opportunity to not impersonate Julia Child, but to do a couple of things," Streep explained. "One, for me embodying her or Julie Powell's idea of her, which is what I'm doing -- I'm doing an idealized version, but I was also doing an idealized version of my mother who had a similar joie de vivre, an undeniable sense of how to enjoy her life. Every room she walked into she made brighter. I mean, she was really something. I have a good deal of my father in me, which is another kind of sensibility. But I really, all my life, wanted to be more like my mother. So, this is my little homage to that spirit."Child died in 2004 at the age of 91.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 10 (UPI) -- Reducing the yearly increases in the cost of U.S. healthcare and improving quality will require both sticks and carrots to more-efficient care, researchers say.Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, said the best opportunity to pursue cost containment in the next five to 10 years was through reforming provider payment to gradually diminish the role of fee-for-service reimbursement. "Public and private payers have begun many promising payment reform pilots ... but meaningful cost containment from payment reform will not be achieved until Medicare and Medicaid establish stronger incentives for providers to contract in this way, with discouragement of non-participation increasing over time," Ginsburg said in a article in Health Affairs. At the same time, encouraging patients through financial incentives to choose higher-performing providers can help control costs.The article, "Achieving Health Care Cost Containment Through Provider Payment Reform That Engages Patients and Providers," also said: "Ending fee-for-service payment -- the predominant U.S. healthcare payment model where services are paid for separately giving an incentive for physicians to provide more treatments because payment is dependent on the quantity of care, rather than quality of care -- once and for all is unlikely to be feasible for quite some time, but gradually increasing disincentives for providers that do not participate in reformed payment approaches is a practical way to move forward."Reformed payment models will also need to increasingly engage beneficiaries, in both the public and the private sectors, to drive patients to providers that are more efficient and deliver higher quality care, Ginsburg said.

LAKE WALES, Fla., Oct. 16 (UPI) -- A Florida woman who stopped with a relative at McDonald's for coffee on the way to the hospital gave birth to a baby boy in the restaurant's bathroom. Shardonnay Hill, 20, said she called her doctor because she wasn't feeling well. Nearing the seven-month mark of her first pregnancy, Hill's doctor told her to go to the hospital. Barbara Albert, Hill's grandmother, drove them but said she needed to stop for coffee because she was tired after just having returned from a trip, the Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger reported.Albert said it's a good thing she did because the pair would never have made it to the hospital in time.While at the counter ordering her coffee Monday morning at the McDonald's restaurant in Lake Wales, Fla., Hill had to go to the bathroom. A short time later an employee said Hill was shouting for Albert to come to the restroom. When she did, Albert said the baby was already partially out.Albert said restaurant employees scrambled to get cardboard for Hill to lay on. An employee named Phyllis delivered the child at the direction of an emergency dispatcher on the phone with another worker.Albert said the baby, Joshua Murphy, was just 2 ½ pounds but is doing well after being airlifted to a children's hospital in St. Petersburg. Hill was being kept for observation overnight at a hospital in Davenport, Fla., but will be reunited with her baby soon, Albert said."I was not ready for this today," Albert said. "I just thank God I needed that caffeine."

CHICAGO, Dec. 16 (UPI) -- U.S. President-elect Barack Obama has been boning up on intelligence matters in recent days, holding long sessions with his foreign policy team, sources say.Typical of his focus on international hot spots was a five-hour Monday meeting in Chicago with National Security Adviser-designate Gen. James Jones, Director of National Intelligence-designate Mike McConnell, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others to discuss problem areas, The New York Times reported."(Obama) has been voracious" in seeking out intelligence information on the world's hot spots, engaging in several long meetings both in person and over the telephone with Jones, an unnamed senior adviser told the newspaper.In recent days, Obama reportedly has studied foreign policy conundrums from around the world, from obscure independence movements in the Western Sahara to whether a planned increase of 20,000 troops in Afghanistan will work. An unnamed official familiar with a meeting between Obama and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Times: "It struck the chairman very much that the president-elect is working very hard to bring himself up to speed, that he's willing to listen, and to learn as he moves his way through the education process."

NEW YORK, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama slammed Rep. Todd Akin, the Missouri Republican on the ropes over his remarks on rape, at a New York campaign appearance Wednesday night.Speaking to about 120 people at a dinner held at the Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, Obama called Akin, who is seeking to unseat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., "an individual who sits on the House Committee on Science and Technology but somehow missed science class."Akin, who opposes abortion, has drawn intense bipartisan criticism for saying women have natural biological protections against impregnation by rapists. He said he misspoke and has apologized but has defied calls from Republican Party leaders -- including presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- to leave the race.Obama said Akin was "representative of the desire to go backwards instead of forwards and fight fights that we thought were settled 20 or 30 years ago."The small crowd included a number of former NBA stars -- such as Bill Bradley, Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Walt Frazier -- prompting the president to say it is "very rare I come to an event where I'm like the fifth- or sixth-most interesting person."Earlier in the day in Las Vegas, Obama hit education themes for a second straight day, pushing for increased funding.Obama addressed a crowd at Canyon Springs High School to address elementary and secondary education a day after focusing on funding for higher education."We all understand there is nothing more important to our country's future than the education we give our children," Obama said to applause. "Nothing more important."Obama noted his sister is a teacher and said he knows education begins at home, but government has to do its part, he said, to provide the funding to enable districts to hire and retain great teachers."If we want America to lead in the 21st century, we've got to give all our children the best education possible," he said.Obama triggered a chorus of boos in noting congressional inaction -- led by presumptive Republican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- on legislation that would have helped states hire and retain tens of thousands of teachers."Now, not only is that unfair to our kids, it's foolish for our future," He said."Now, my opponent in this election doesn't seem to understand this. Mitt Romney says we've got enough teachers. We don't need any more. The way he talks about them, it seems as if he thinks these are a bunch of nameless government bureaucrats that we need to cut back on -- those are his words. And his economic plan certainly would do that. The plan Governor Romney has put forward would cut America's investment in education by nearly 20 percent" to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.Before addressing the crowd, Obama met with a group of three teachers.

CAIRO, June 21 (UPI) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his family have about $1.3 billion -- including cash, stock and property -- the prosecutor's office said.Mahmoud El-Hefnawi, who works in the office's technical department, broke down Mubarak's wealth as $400 million in cash, $700 million in stocks and $140 million in real estate, Ahram Online reported.Mubarak is in prison awaiting two trials on corruption charges, as well as a retrial on the killing of peaceful protesters during the 18-day 2011 uprising that led to his ouster.He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in June 2012 for failing to protect protesters, but successfully appealed the conviction and sentence.Egypt's Illicit Gains Authority estimated Mubarak's fortune in 2011 at $145 million and the worth of his wife, Suzanne Mubarak, at $2.8 million, plus a villa in Heliopolis.Mubarak's lawyer said his client's fortune totaled about $1 million.
