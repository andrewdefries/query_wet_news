WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 (UPI) -- The U.S. Pending Home Sales Index slipped 1.3 percent in July after sliding in June, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.The index hit a six-year peak in May before entering a two-month slide. In July, the index dropped to 109.5 from June's level of 110.9.The index remains 6.7 percent higher than July 2012, when it stood at 102.6.Pending home sales, which reflects sales activities one and two months down the road, have risen on an annual basis for 27 consecutive months.The index is a comparison to the monthly average for 2001, its first year, which was assigned a value of 100.The NAR said the Pending Home Sales Index for the Northeast fell 6.5 percent to 81.5 in July, although it came in 3.3 percent higher than July 2012.In the Midwest, the index, dropped 1 percent to 113.2, a level 14.5 percent higher than July 2012.In July, the index rose 2.6 percent in the South to 121.5, which is 7.7 percent higher than 12 months prior. In the West, the index came to 108.6, down 4.9 percent from June and 0.4 percent below July 2012."The modest decline in sales is not yet concerning, and contract activity remains elevated, with the South and Midwest showing no measurable slowdown," said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist in a statement."However, higher mortgage interest rates and rising home prices are impacting monthly contract activity in the high-cost regions of the Northeast and the West," Yun said."More homes clearly need to be built in the West to relieve price pressure, or the region could soon face pronounced affordability problems," Yun said.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec. 12 (UPI) -- Blacks have double whites' risk of dying of coronary heart disease -- narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, U.S. researchers say.Monika Safford of the University of Alabama at Birmingham said the study involved more than 24,000 people nationwide who were tracked for an average of four years. "High blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol -- these are the things that have very longstanding reputation for being associated with heart attack," Safford said in a statement. "And the overall risk burden in blacks is quite a bit higher than it is in whites."The study participants resided in the continental United States and were enrolled between 2003 and 2007 with follow-up through December 2009. Blacks and whites had a similar average age, but smoking, diabetes, and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate -- a measure of kidney function -- were more prevalent, and systolic blood pressure and body mass index were higher among blacks than whites, Safford said. Women had lower incidence rates than men within each racial group. However, black women had higher incidence rates for total coronary heart disease, for fatal coronary heart disease, and for non-fatal coronary heart disease, compared to white women. In addition, the increased risk of fatal coronary heart disease among blacks was associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors.The findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (UPI) -- Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan said Sunday he doesn't think Wednesday's debate will "make or break this campaign."A decisive victory, though, is still critical to the race, he said in an interview on "Fox News Sunday.""I don't think one event is going to make or break this campaign. President Obama is a very ... gifted speaker. ... I think what people are going to see [is] who is Mitt Romney, what kind of a president he is going to be and what are the choices I have," he said.Ryan said the debate will present Americans with a clear choice come election day in November."We owe the country a very clear choice of a different future. ... We can stick with the failed policies of the ... last [four] years for the next four years, or we can get a brighter future," he said.Ryan pointed to what he called the Obama administration's "weak foreign policy" as an example of how different the policies of the two camps are. He called the president's response to the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans slow, confused and inconsistent."We're seeing the ugly fruits of the Obama foreign policy unravel around the world on our TV screens. Syria, you've got 20,000 dead people. Iran is closer toward a nuclear weapon. The Middle East peace process is in shambles and we have our flags being burned all around the world. Russia is thwarting us at every stage in the process. This is a weak foreign policy with terrible results which makes us less safe," Ryan said.Follow us on Twitter at @UPIDebates for complete UPI.com coverage of the 2012 Presidential Debates.

IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 7 (UPI) -- Police said Thursday a fugitive former Los Angeles police officer suspected of killing three people may be in Big Bear, a mountain resort east of Los Angeles.Big Bear Fire Department Assistant Chief Mark Mills told the Los Angeles Times fresh tracks at the resort town are believed to have been left by Christopher Jordan Dorner. Mills said a burning pickup truck found on a forest road has been linked to Dorner, 33, who posted a manifesto online in which he threatened to harm police officials and their families, the newspaper reported.A manhunt was under way in Southern California for Dorner, suspected of killing a young Irvine couple last weekend and killing a Riverside police officer and wounding another Thursday. He is also suspected of wounding an LAPD officer near Corona Thursday.San Diego police Capt. Terry McManus told a news conference there is evidence "that is clear to us indicates Dorner was in the San Diego area."Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Thursday the situation was "extremely worrisome and scary" and said Dorner, a former U.S. Naval Reserve lieutenant, was "armed and extremely dangerous," the Los Angeles Times reported."Of course he knows what he's doing -- we trained him," Beck said.Asked if he had a message for Dorner, Beck said: "I would tell him to turn himself in. This has gone far enough. No one else needs to die."San Diego police Lt. Joseph Ramos said someone accosted an 81-year-old boat owner and tried to steal the vessel at a marina near the Naval Base Point Loma submarine base.Dorner, described as a 6-foot African-American weighing about 270 pounds, still has a military ID that would get him on the base, but Ramos said it was not clear whether the attacker at the marina was Dorner.Naval officials said Dorner is an Iraq veteran, KGTV, San Diego, reported.Sources told the Times police deployed security personnel at the homes of LAPD officials named in the manifesto, in which Dorner named as a target retired LAPD Capt. Randy Quan, the father of Monica Quan, the California State University-Fullerton assistant basketball coach who was found shot to death Sunday, along with her fiance, Keith Lawrence.Randy Quan was part of the review that led to Dorner's dismissal in 2009 for allegedly lying about his training officer.Dorner said in his online post being a police officer had been his life's ambition and he has suffered from severe depression. He said he was filled with rage directed toward the people who forced him out, the Times said.Dorner complained he wasn't fairly represented by Quan and others during the review hearing."Your lack of ethics and conspiring to wrong a just individual are over. Suppressing the truth will [lead] to deadly consequences for you and your family. There will be an element of surprise where you work, live, eat, and sleep," he wrote, referring to Quan and several others."I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I'm terminating yours," he said.He threatened violence against other police officers in the manifesto."The violence of action will be high. ... I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty," Dorner wrote.He also referenced the Irvine slayings in his online post."I know most of you who personally know me are in disbelief to hear from media reports that I am suspected of committing such horrendous murders and have taken drastic and shocking actions in the last couple of days," he said. "Unfortunately ... this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name."Los Angeles police who were guarding an LAPD officer named in Dorner's manifesto mistakenly shot and wounded two women who were delivering newspapers in Torrance Thursday morning, Beck said."Tragically, we believe this is a case of mistaken identity," he said.One of the women was listed in stable condition with two gunshot wounds and the other suffered what officials described as a minor wound.

PHOENIX, May 9 (UPI) -- The aggravation phase of convicted murder Jodi Arias' Phoenix trial was delayed until May 15, Judge Sherry Stephens decided Thursday.No reason was given for the postponement of the next phase of the trial that will more closely examine whether Arias receives the death penalty for stabbing and shooting to death her ex-lover, Travis Alexander, CNN reported.The Arizona Republic earlier reported Arias, who was found guilty of premeditated murder in the slaying, was on suicide watch in her Maricopa County jail cell Wednesday night.The Republic said Arias appeared mostly calm and deliberate during her exclusive interview with KSAZ-TV that was conducted in a courthouse holding cell shortly after the verdict was read. "The worst outcome for me would be natural life [in prison]. I would much rather die sooner rather than later," she said."I said years ago I'd rather get death than life. I believe death is the ultimate freedom."Arias was asked what she would do if ordered to spend the rest of her life in prison."I haven't decided yet," she said, her voice cracking.The Sheriff's Office issued a statement saying her comments during the interview prompted a suicide watch, the Republic said."In light of some of her statements during the interview, Arias was brought to jail and per Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, was placed on suicide protocol," the sheriff's office said.The newspaper said while Arias apparently express sorrow for killing the 30-year-old Alexander, she said she hopes his family finds solace in her conviction.She has maintained she killed Alexander in self-defense and "there was no premeditation on my part."The jury received the case Friday after a sensational, four-month trial in which the couple's sex lives were laid out in detail.

GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba, Dec. 31 (UPI) -- Three Chinese detainees at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were sent voluntarily to Slovakia, the U.S. Defense Department announced Tuesday.The three were the last of 22 ethnic Uighurs from China captured in Afghanistan after the U.S. invasion in 2001 and brought to Guantanamo facility, where they remained until a country agreed to accept them, the New York Times reported.Although the military decided that the Uighurs were not at war with the United States and should be released, the United States could not repatriate the Uighurs because the Chinese government has a history of mistreating Uighurs. Other countries expressed reluctance to take them in, in part because of diplomatic pressure exerted by China."The United States is grateful to the government of Slovakia for this humanitarian gesture and its willingness to support U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility," said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. "The United States coordinated with the government of Slovakia to ensure the transfer took place in accordance with appropriate security and humane treatment measures." Nine detainees left Guantanamo in December, and 11 since last summer, when President Obama revived his efforts to close the prison. There are 155 prisoners remaining at the facility.

Wiki
Maria Yuryevna Sharapova (born April 19, 1987) is a Russian professional tennis player and a former World No. 1. A US resident since 1994, Sharapova has won 24 WTA singles titles, including three Grand Slam singles titles at the 2004 Wimbledon, 2006 US Open and 2008 Australian Open. She has also won the year-end invitational WTA Tour Championships in 2004.
The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has ranked Sharapova World No. 1 in singles on four separate occasions. She became the World No. 1 for the first time on Aug 22, 2005 and last regained this ranking for the fourth time on May 19, 2008. She is currently ranked World No. 2. She has been in 5 Grand Slam finals. Her Grand Slam final record is 3–2.
Sharapova made her professional breakthrough in 2004 when, at age 17, she upset two-time defending champion and top seed Serena Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final for her first Grand Slam singles title. She entered the top ten of the WTA Rankings with this win. Despite not winning a major in 2005, Sharapova briefly held the number one ranking, and reached three Grand Slam semifinals, losing to the eventual champion each time. She won her second major at the 2006 US Open defeating then-World No. 1 Amélie Mauresmo in the semifinals and World No. 2 Justine Henin in the final. Sharapova's 2007 season was plagued with a chronic shoulder injury, and saw her ranking fall out of the top 5 for the first time in two years. She ultimately won her third Grand Slam at the 2008 Australian Open, defeating Henin in the quarterfinals and Ana Ivanović in the final. After reclaiming the number one ranking in May 2008, Sharapova's shoulder problems re-surfaced, ultimately requiring surgery in October and forcing her out of the game for nearly ten months. Sharapova returned in May 2009 and was ranked No. 126 in the world due to her extensive lay-off. Since her comeback, Sharapova has won 5 singles titles (bringing her career total to 24) and improved her ranking to within the top 5.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
