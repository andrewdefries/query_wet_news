NEW DELHI, May 20 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Energy's conditional approval a Texas liquefied natural gas terminal to export to nations that do not have a free trade agreement with the United States is seen as a potential boost for India's energy security.The Freeport LNG on Quintana Island in Texas is conditionally authorized to export as much as 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day for 20 years, DOE said Friday.The approval is seen as a significant indication of how the U.S. government could decide on up to 20 other applications to export LNG.While India is not likely to benefit immediately from the approval -- as China, Japan and Britain already have a stake in the Freeport facility -- it opens the door for Indian companies to seek similar licenses to import huge quantities of the much-needed gas from the United States as new terminals are approved, Press Trust of India reports.Indian Ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao, speaking at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington earlier this month, pushed for the export of U.S. natural gas to India, saying it presented a "win-win" co-operation opportunity for both nations. India does not have a free trade agreement with the United States."My country needs to secure more clean energy supplies to foster the sustainable, ecologically balanced, socio-economic development of millions of our people who still live in poverty," Rao said.India is currently the fourth largest energy consumer in the world after the United States, China and Russia.Rao said the demand-supply gap of natural gas in India, now estimated about 2.2 trillion cubic feet a year, would likely rise to almost 4 trillion cubic feet by 2016-17. By 2030, India's demand for natural gas is expected to reach 8 trillion cubic feet a year.Because of its linkage to Henry Hub prices, natural gas from the United States would mean "considerable savings" to India, estimated at $4 to $5 per million metric British thermal units, the ambassador said."The point that I would like to stress is that the advantage is mutual and that natural gas exports represent a 'win-win' co-operation opportunity," Rao said.In May 2011, the DOE granted the first authorization to export LNG to non-FTA countries from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Cameron Parish in Louisiana at a rate of as much as 2.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day.In December of that year, state-run Gas Authority of India Limited announced it had agreed to buy 3.5 million tons a year of LNG for 20 years from the Sabine facility.

July 2 (UPI) -- Katie Stoltzfus, star of TLC's "Breaking Amish," has shed more than her bonnet for a photo shoot in next month's Maxim.Stoltzfus, who is trying to jump-start her modeling career, has become the first Amish woman to ever pose for Maxim. She swapped her loose dresses for a skimpy bustier and high-waisted short-shorts for her biggest spread yet.Stoltzfus said that she's not the only Amish woman that has the physique to appear in Maxim -- in fact, she says "there are definitely a lot of Amish women who have great bodies, because they work hard," Stoltzfus said."They also eat really healthy, since they grow their own food. That's one big thing I miss about home, being able to garden and take care of plants." Stoltzfus signed with a modeling agency in the last season finale of "Breaking Amish," but she initially had hangups on showing so much skin."Before I had even signed a contract with a modeling agency, I did a test shoot to see if I could photograph well, and the first outfit they put me in was a bathing suit!" Stoltzfus said. "I have to admit, it was a little intimidating, but now I enjoy doing it."

BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 5 (UPI) -- Websites where consumers sign up for the new U.S. healthcare law were partially suspended Saturday to fix "glitches" in the system, federal officials say.An estimated 8.6 million people have visited the sites since they opened Tuesday, officials say, but many people have been frustrated in their attempts to reach the sites, The New York Times reported Friday.A New Hampshire insurance broker who wanted to help clients was among the exasperated would-be users."I have tried more than a dozen times, in the middle of the day and the middle of the night," said Thomas M. Harte, president of the National Association of Health Underwriters.Federal officials have declined to say how many people have signed up for health insurance through the sites, known as exchanges. However, a section of the Web where people can apply for coverage will be upgraded over the weekend, the administration said. As a result, the sites will be unavailable for several hours both Saturday and Sunday.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the opponents of the law, said while President Barack Obama called the problems "glitches," they were "systemic failures of the Obamacare exchanges -- obviously not ready for prime time."House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement Friday the website problem "confirms that the launch of the president's healthcare law has been an unmitigated disaster."The Department of Health and Human Services said the sites would go offline during "off-peak hours," adding that the upgrades would provide "significant improvements in the online consumer experience.""We know some of you are having trouble getting to the application at the website HealthCare.gov and we are sorry for any delays. Thanks for your patience, and please keep trying!" officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, part of the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.Those needing help with a marketplace application can contact the 24/7 call center, use the live chat function, or go to LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov to find an in-person assister in your community, CMS said.Those who don't have health insurance provided by an employer have six months to enroll.

CHICAGO, Dec. 6 (UPI) -- Some $570 million in various U.S. lottery prizes went unclaimed last year, USA Today reported Thursday.Illinois Lottery spokesman Courtney Hill told the newspaper the state has one outstanding $11.7 million Lotto ticket sold July 28 at an gas station in Chicago, along with three $250,000 Mega Millions tickets approaching expiration."If a lottery prize hasn't been picked up in three months, it probably never will be," Hill said.The majority of lottery tickets expire after either 90 days, 180 days or one year, depending on state rules.Powerball and Mega Millions, the two multistate lottery games, return unclaimed prizes to the states proportionately, based on the number of tickets sold.There are 42 states that operate lotteries, and the majority of them keep unclaimed prize money for education and other programs, the report said.There is a $31 million unclaimed Mega Millions ticket sold this year in New York while the biggest-ever lost fortune was a $51.7 million Powerball ticket sold in Indiana in 2002.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, June 26 (UPI) -- Employees of U.S. intelligence agencies can be asked specifically about leaks of classified information to the media, the director of intelligence said.James R. Clapper Jr. has instructed agencies that regularly administer counterintelligence polygraphs to their employees to add a question aimed at disclosure of classified information and media contacts, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.In addition, lie detector tests can be authorized immediately for any intelligence community personnel who had access to classified information that was leaked. "These efforts will reinforce our professional values by sending a strong message that intelligence personnel always have, and always will, hold ourselves to the highest standard of professionalism," Clapper said.The new measures come as the Obama administration seeks to combat recent leaks of classified information to the news media, The New York Times reported.At the same time, the House and Senate intelligence committees are working on legislation to tighten access to classified information and give the government the ability to take either criminal or administrative action in such cases.Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Clapper's changes "a good first step."

MUSKEGON, Mich., July 9 (UPI) -- A Michigan woman who sought the death of her husband says, in a videotaped meeting with an undercover police officer, a killing would be easier than divorce.Julia Charlene Merfeld, 20, of Muskegon pleaded guilty in June to soliciting a murder and was to be sentenced July 30. On videotapes released by prosecutors to WZZM-TV, Grand Rapids, Merfeld is heard telling the police detective, posing as a hit man, a killing would be "easier than divorcing him" and she would not have to worry about "breaking his heart" or the judgment of her family. She sought the $400,000 available in the life insurance policy of her unidentified husband, 27, and promised to pay $50,000 for the killing, authorities said.

| License Photo	Sept. 25 (UPI) -- Melissa Joan Hart is well-known for playing girl-next-door types like Clarissa Darling and Sabrina, the teenage witch, so you'd never know that the 37-year-old actress spent part of her youth experimenting with drugs and hooking up with fellow celebrities. Hart reveals details about her Hollywood exploits in a new memoir, "Melissa Explains It All," which she previewed in an interview with Life & Style. "I experimented with weed, Ecstasy, mushrooms and mescaline for about a year and a half,” the "Melissa & Joey" star told the mag. In one example, Hart attended a 1999 party at the hedonistic Playboy Mansion, where she took Ecstasy and made out with another girl on the limo ride home. “I was kind of running with a bad crowd,” Hart added, though she never spiraled into a full-blown addiction like many of her contemporaries. “I just didn’t enjoy taking drugs. I don’t like the loss of control.”Among other adventures, Hart turned down coke from Paris Hilton, made out with Jerry O'Connell and Backstreet Boy Nick Carter (who's just come out with a tell-all of his own).

Wiki
Margaret Jane Pauley (born October 31, 1950; Indianapolis, Indiana) is an American television journalist, and has been involved in news reporting since 1975. She is most known for her 13-year tenure on NBC's Today program and later 12 years of Dateline NBC, and has acknowledged publicly her struggle with mental health and bipolar disorder.
Pauley competed in debate and public speaking tournaments through the Indiana High School Forensic Association while enrolled at Warren Central High School in Indianapolis. Pauley graduated from Warren Central High School in 1968. She subsequently earned a scholarship to Indiana University, where she was involved in the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. After college, she worked from 1972 to 1975 at WISH in Indianapolis and from 1975 to 1976 at WMAQ in Chicago; from there she joined network television.
From 1976 to 1989 Pauley was the co-host, with Tom Brokaw and later Bryant Gumbel, of NBC's The Today Show. Following in the footsteps, both in career and in style, of the first female anchor of the show, Barbara Walters, she became a symbol for professional women, more specifically female journalists, in the 1980s (In her autobiography, "And So It Goes", Pauley's colleague Linda Ellerbee wrote, "She (Pauley) is what I want to be when I grow up"). NBC briefly experimented with a trio of anchors, Pauley, Gumbel, and Chris Wallace, before returning to a co-anchor format with Gumbel and with Pauley serving in a deferential co-host capacity.
