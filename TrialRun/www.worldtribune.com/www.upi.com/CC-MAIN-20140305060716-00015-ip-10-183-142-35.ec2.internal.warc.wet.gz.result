WASHINGTON, April 2 (UPI) -- The U.S. Chemical Safety Board said it was relieved that a Texas court threw out a challenge to its jurisdiction in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.The Federal Court in the Southern District of Texas upheld the board's legal authority to investigate the blowout and explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.The CSB said Transocean, which leased the rig to BP, raised a number of legal arguments challenging its authority to access information related to the disaster.The 2010 incident left 11 rig workers dead and resulted in the worst offshore oil spill of its kind in the history of the oil industry.The CSB said the court found that Transocean raised no substantial challenge other than to claim the board exceeded its statutory authority."This ruling greatly supports the CSB's ongoing investigation and will enable CSB investigators to access critical information that might have otherwise been unavailable," the board said in a statement.The CSB said it's taking a "broad look" at the 2010 spill. It's examining regulating agencies as well as safety controls, corporate governance and human factors.Transocean has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor environmental charge and agreed to pay $1.4 billion in civil and criminal penalties. A separate trial is under way in a New Orleans court involving BP, Transocean and Halliburton.

PERTH, Australia, Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Of the species of life on Earth that will be affected by global warming, seaweeds in our oceans may be especially vulnerable, Australian scientists say.Herbarium records collected in Australia since the 1940s suggest up to 25 percent of temperate seaweed species living there could be headed to extinction, researchers at the University of Western Australia said."Our findings add an important piece in the puzzle that is determining the global impacts of climate change," Thomas Wernberg said.The findings in Australia, published in the journal Current Biology, represent two of the major global oceans, the Indian and Pacific, Wernberg said."We found that temperate seaweed communities have changed over the past 50 years to become increasingly subtropical, and that many temperate species have retreated south towards the Australian south coast."We estimated that projected ocean warming could lead to several hundred species retracting south and beyond the edge of the Australian continent, where they will have no suitable habitat and may therefore go extinct."This could have cascading effects across marine ecosystems, Wernberg said, as seaweeds are the "trees of the ocean," providing food, shelter and habitat to a diversity of other species.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 21 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama Wednesday signed financial reform legislation, making the most sweeping changes to the U.S. financial system in 70 years.Obama said the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will replace an "antiquated and poorly enforced" system that led to the worst recession since the Great Depression."The economy is growing again but too many people are still feeling the pain of the downturn," Obama said, citing the 8 million jobs lost since the recession began with the collapse of the housing industry at the end of 2007.Obama said unless one's business plan depends on bilking customers or cutting corners, "you've got nothing to fear" from financial reform.Too often, Obama said, consumers are caught by hidden fees and other complex rules buried in pages of legalese."This law will end that for good," Obama said, highlighting the new consumer protection provisions that are part of the bill. "With this law we will crack down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry … so people will know what they're signing. … These reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history."He added: "Now, that's not just good for consumers; that's good for the economy. Because reform will put a stop to a lot of the bad loans that fueled a debt-based bubble. And it will mean all companies will have to seek customers by offering better products, instead of more deceptive ones."Obama said the measure puts an end to taxpayer-funded bailouts and reins in the "abuse and excesses" that brought down our financial system.""The fact is every American from Main Street to Wall Street has a stake in our financial system. … That's why we all stand to win," he said, adding that only clear and sensible regulation can keep the system humming along."For these new rules to be effective, regulators will have to be vigilant. We also may need to make adjustments along the way as our financial system adapts to these changes. And no law can force anybody to be responsible; it is still incumbent on those on Wall Street to heed the lessons of this crisis in how they conduct business." Obama thanked Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., for the work they put in on the measure and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada for their leadership in the face of a massive lobbying effort by the financial industry and what Democrats said was obstructionism by the Republican minority.Pelosi called the bill a "step forward for the middle class.""With this law in place, the homes, retirements, and college savings of Main Street consumers will come first. With these historic changes, we will help ensure that a future crisis does not compromise the financial security of hard-working Americans," Pelosi said.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., hailed the measure."Two years ago, we faced a financial collapse that has cost our economy 8 million jobs and cost many families their homes and savings -- a collapse which Minority Leader John Boehner derisively compared to an ant," Hoyer said. "That collapse was in large part due to years of Republican rule when they took the referees off the field and allowed Wall Street free rein to play with our economy."Boehner countered the Democratic rhetoric, saying the measure will makes Wall Street bailouts permanent and will hurt job creation."House Republicans offered a better solution -- one that would stop the Democrats' permanent bailouts, reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, protect taxpayers, and help small businesses create jobs. Our better solution holds President Obama's Wall Street allies accountable, while his plan lets them off the hook," Boehner said.The signing occurred at the Ronald Reagan Building.

NEW YORK, March 24 (UPI) -- About 300 illegal immigrants are locked up in solitary confinement at detention facilities in the United States every day, federal records said.The New York Times reviewed records for 50 of the largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities and found detainees were kept in isolation for their own protection or for breaking facility rules.The records did not detail the reasons individuals were placed in solitary, but human rights activists told the newspaper the practice amounted to abuse since the inmates face civil rather than criminal charges."I.C.E. is clearly using excessive force, since these are civil detentions," said Dr. Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist who studies solitary confinement at California's Wright Institute. "And that makes this a human rights abuse."Approximately half of those in solitary were held for 15 days or more, which psychiatric experts consider the limit before mental health begins to suffer. About 35 were held for more than 75 days.The Times said the 300-per-day average amounts to about 1 percent of the immigrants detained on a given day. Sources said it appeared about two-thirds of the detainees were locked up for disciplinary reasons. The others were isolated for their own protection because they were homosexual or mentally ill.A spokeswoman for I.C.E. said placing inmates in solitary was a "last resort" for facility guards. "I.C.E. takes the mental healthcare of individuals in the agency's custody very seriously," she said.

NAYPYITAW, Myanmar, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Japan will write off almost $6 billion in Myanmar's debt and provide a new loan of about $600 million, Finance Minister Taro Aso said Thursday.Aso made the announcement after a meeting with Myanmar President Thein Sein in Naypyitaw, Kyodo News Service reported. He said the write down will erase 500 billion yen ($5.73 billion) with the new loan coming to 10 percent of that sum. "Japan wants to maintain sound relations with Myanmar even if there was a change of its government," Aso said at a news conference after the 80-minute meeting. "Myanmar has been heavily in debt and unable to attract investment. Japan will remove those obstacles and support the country."The trip to Myanmar was Aso's first since becoming foreign minister last week, Asia News said. The military regime that ruled Myanmar for two decades, changing its name from Burma and building a new capital city, began liberalization in 2011. Japan was Myanmar's largest creditor and Aso said the old debt was discouraging new investment in the country. "Myanmar has been unable to make new investments because it is bound to the old debts. The debt waiver is meant to remove this obstacle to Myanmar's economic growth," Aso said.

April 30 (UPI) -- If you're a Netflix subscriber, you can say goodbye to "Octopussy," "Cruel Intentions" and "Big Daddy." In what The Atlantic Wire is calling the Great Netflix Instant Vanishing of 2013, 1,794 movie titles will disappear from the company's popular instant streaming video service on Wednesday. According to Slate, those films will become the exclusive property of Warner Archive Instant, another streaming service for "rare and hard-to-find" films launched this month. Many of the titles, however, are older classics from the 20th century, so casual movie watchers shouldn't necessarily fret. Instant Watcher has the full list of expiring titles here. Netflix communications director Joris Evers provided Mashable with the following statement, saying that subscribers can expect the service to add 500 more titles to its catalogue on May 1. Netflix is a dynamic service, we constantly update the TV shows and movies that are available to our members. We will add more than 500 titles May 1, but we also have titles expiring, this ebb and flow happens all the time.We are selective about what’s available to watch on Netflix. We often license TV shows and movies on an exclusive basis, so we can provide a unique experience. We’ll forego, or choose not renew, titles that aren’t watched enough. We always use our knowledge about what our members love to watch to decide what’s available on Netflix.

| License Photo	May 6 (UPI) -- Rush Limbaugh says he's not to blame for declining revenue at his flagship radio station, WABC. The conservative talk radio host could leave when his contract expires at the end of the year if bosses keep saying it's his fault.The claims stem from a February 2012 show in which Limbaugh called law student Sandra Fluke a “slut” and a "prostitute" after she testified before Washington lawmakers urging mandated insurance coverage of birth control.Outraged groups called on advertisers to drop Limbaugh’s show, and hundreds, including Sears, Geico, John Deere, Netflix, Capitol One and the New York Lottery, did.Lew Dickey, CEO of WABC parent company Cumulus, said Limbaugh’s controversial comments have diminished ad revenue for the past year, and the station remains slumped in a "residual hangover."Limbaugh told New York Daily News that “Lew needs someone to blame, [so] he’s pointing fingers instead of fixing his own sales problem.” Limbaugh has maintained that departing advertisers were replaced, and a source close to the show said ad revenue was “very minimally impacted in the short term.”Dickey told analysts that the Fluke controversy cost Cumulus “a couple of million” in the first quarter of 2012 and another "couple of million” in the second quarter. Cumulus was “hit pretty hard by this,” he said, attributing nearly a third of Cumulus' 3.5 percent drop for that period to Limbaugh's comments.

Wiki
Gerald Green, Jr. (born January 26, 1986 in Houston, Texas) is an American professional basketball player with the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association. He was selected by the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Boston Celtics with the 18th pick of the first round in the 2005 NBA Draft. He has performed well in many slam dunk competitions, having won the 2005 McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest and the 2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, while finishing as the runner-up in the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.
Green did not play high school basketball until his sophomore year, when he played junior varsity for J. Frank Dobie High School. In his junior year he made the varsity team, but his play was cut short because of academic issues.
He transferred to a charter school, Gulf Shores Academy in Houston, where he repeated his junior year. In his senior year at Gulf Shores, he averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. He was named an All-American and was the high scorer in the 2005 McDonald's All-American game scoring 24 points., which features two teams composed of the best high school basketball players in the US. Green also won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest that year, defeating future Duke player Josh McRoberts.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
