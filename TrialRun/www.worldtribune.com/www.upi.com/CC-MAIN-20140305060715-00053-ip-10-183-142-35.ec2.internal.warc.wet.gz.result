| License Photo	LONDON, Feb. 20 (UPI) -- The U.S. dollar will remain the world's chief reserve currency for decades and likely increase in strength, a senior Chinese central banker wrote in a paper."The dollar's global dominance will continue," Jin Zhongxia, head of the research institute of the People's Bank of China, wrote in a personal commentary for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London banking and financial-industry think tank.His commentary can be found at tinyurl.com/Jin-Zhongxia.Jin said the world was moving to a "1+4" global currency system."The dollar will continue to be the super reserve currency, supplemented by four smaller reserve currencies: the euro and the British pound in Europe, and the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi in Asia," he said.The dollar's global dominance reflects "U.S. economic, financial and military power," Jin said, and the currency has resilience to economic shocks that other key currencies, such as the euro, don't have -- as demonstrated by the eurozone debt crisis."The debt crisis in the euro area has demonstrated the structural weakness of this currency," he said. "If we take into consideration that the euro partially relies on the dollar's payments infrastructure for its cross-border transactions, we can say that the euro is basically a very large regional reserve currency."But the sheer size of the euro area economy and financial market, together with its highly advanced science and technology, will maintain the euro as the second most important international currency, behind only the dollar, in the foreseeable future," Jin said.Indeed, he said, the dollar has developed an informal "dollar zone" worldwide nexus as a globally traded safe-haven currency recognized as a reliable and stable store of value."The U.S. economy is not merely stronger than that of the euro area by itself. In addition, the U.S. economy also enjoys the existence of an unofficial dollar zone," he said."Those countries in the world that rely on the dollar for most of their international transactions and hold dollars as major international reserve asset all belong to the de facto dollar zone."Compared to the euro area, the dollar zone has much greater resilience to shocks. This is because the exchange rate between the dollar and the other currencies are mostly not fixed and can be adjusted when necessary," Jin wrote."The dollar zone looks much more loosely connected, but in reality it is more coherent than the euro area, despite the official commitment of the euro member states to that currency."

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, April 26 (UPI) -- Hollywood actress-model Jessica Alba says she wore two girdles to return to her slender toned body following both of her pregnancies."It was brutal; it's not for everyone," the 31-year-old told online fashion retailer Net-a-Porter's digital magazine."I wore a double corset day and night for three months. It was sweaty, but worth it," she said.Alba is married to Cash Warren, son of actor Michael Warren, who played Officer Bobby Hill on the NBC TV series "Hill Street Blues."The couple have two daughters, Honor Marie Warren, age 4, and Haven Garner Warren, 1.Celebrities including Brooke Burke-Charvet, Jennifer Garner, Kourtney Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow are reported to have used the tummy-tucking method too, the Los Angeles Times says.Alba mentioned nothing in the article about any health issues tied to wearing the corsets. Doctors warn wearing them for long periods can lead to health concerns.The actress, who got her start in 1994 at age 13 in the Disney Hollywood Pictures film "Camp Nowhere" and the Nickelodeon TV series "The Secret World of Alex Mack," spoke to the Net-a-Porter magazine about the film "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For," in which she reprises her "Sin City" role as Nancy Callahan.The cast includes returning members Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis."I just finished the best movie I've ever done," she said. "It was so opposite to what I do [at home]."My approach to acting now is so different -- I'm fearless because I have nothing to lose. Before [having children] my identity was wrapped up in every decision," she said. "Now, I don't care. It could be a pile of [expletive] and you could think it was the worst thing you ever saw, but I still had the best experience."

NEW YORK, March 11 (UPI) -- New York health officials are opening a "rodent college" to teach city workers ways to get rid of rats.The course -- titled "Integrated Pest Management Control Academy" -- is funded with a three-year federal grant, the New York Daily News reported Friday.New York Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden, at a City Council budget hearing Thursday, said," This is the No. 1 issues that gets brought to my attention by New Yorkers." The Daily News said the city's 311 phone line received nearly 7,500 rat-related complaints from July to October last year.The city has begun a "rat indexing" program, the newspaper said, in which workers will conduct block-by-block investigations searching for food sources and burrows.Edgar Butts, assistant commissioner for veterinary and pest control services, told the Daily News "rats are intelligent animals" and will sniff out many bait programs. He added as long as open trash containers are handy, no amount of rat poison would get rid of the vermin.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Oct. 22 (UPI) -- Climate change increased deaths in Stockholm from 1980-2009, with 300 more than there would have been without temperature increases, researchers said.A study, from Umea University researchers and published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said global warming not only means a general increase in temperature but also increases the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves, which can cause an increase in premature deaths.Periods of extremely high temperatures increased significantly over the period 1980-2009, contributing to about 300 more deaths during heat waves than had been the case without climate change, they said."Mortality associated with extreme heat during the relevant period was doubled, compared to if we had not had some climate change," said study leader Daniel Oudin Astrom, a doctoral student in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. "Furthermore, we saw that even though the winters have become milder, extremely cold periods occurred more often, which also contributed to a small increase in mortality during the winter."Despite research on the effects of climate change Swedes haven't changed their attitude of willingness to protect themselves against extreme temperatures, Astrom said."The study findings do not suggest any adaptation of the Swedes when it comes to confronting the increasingly warmer climate, such as increased use of air conditioning in elderly housing," he said. "It is probably because there is relatively little knowledge in regards to increased temperatures and heat waves on health."

SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 3 (UPI) -- A Utah man lied to a judge, saying he was an illegal immigrant, so he would be deported to Mexico and avoid a lengthy prison term, court documents indicate.Jaime Alvarado told a District Court judge in February 2010 his name was Saul Quiroz and he was in the country illegally after being arrested for distribution of a controlled substance, The Washington Post reported Thursday.He was deported to Mexico but re-entered the country in April 2010, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. He was arrested again in February on a warrant relating to the initial charges but this time he told the judge he had lied about his name and about being a Mexican citizen.Immigration and Customs Enforcement held him until he was verified as a U.S. citizen. Alvarado faces charges of false or inconsistent material statements and false personal information given to a police officer."I have never seen something like this happen. More often than not, the situation works the other way -- a person claims to be legal to avoid detection," immigration attorney Rishi Oza told the Post. "I have never seen an American citizen try to get deported."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 10 (UPI) -- Five days before two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon, an intelligence report said the finish line was an area vulnerable to small-scale bombings.The assessment also said "no credible, specific information indicating an imminent threat" to the race had been noted, Tribune Newspapers reported Friday."The FBI has not identified any specific lone offender or extremist group who pose a threat to the Boston Marathon," the report said. The report was written by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, a command center of federal and local law enforcement authorities and funded in part by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.In the aftermath of the April 15 bombings that killed three people and injured hundreds, what was known to whom when has become contentious. Federal officials said the warning showed they did their job, but Boston and Massachusetts law enforcement officials said during a congressional hearing Thursday the FBI didn't tell them about an investigation into Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack. "We would have liked to have known," Edward Davis, Boston Police Department commissioner, told the House Homeland Security Committee in the first of several hearings investigating the attacks. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with the police April 19, four days after the Boston Marathon bombings. His brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, also suspected in the bombings, was captured later that day and is in a federal prison medical facility in Massachusetts.Davis said he didn't know how local officials would have interpreted Tamerlan Tsarnaev's 2012 trip to Dagestan, noting that the FBI interviewed the 26-year-old but found nothing suspicious and that Russian officials did not tell the FBI why they were interested. "We would certainly have looked at the information," Davis said. "We would certainly have talked to the individual." But, he added, "I can't say I would have come to a different conclusion" than the FBI.The Homeland Security threat assessment was dated April 10 and included a map of the Boylston Street finish line area, the area targeted by the bombers. Davis said his officers would "absolutely" have taken a second look at Tsarnaev if they had known about the warning."My fear is that the Boston bombers succeeded because our system failed," said U.S. Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas.The FBI said Boston police could have read the information about Tsarnaev as easily as any other Joint Terrorism Task Force member, noting the force "specifically had representatives assigned to the JTTF squad that conducted the 2011 assessment of deceased terrorism suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev." The FBI statement noted the Boston task force had conducted some 1,000 assessments in 2011, a workload that made it unlikely each assessment could get close attention from every task force member.It also noted Tamerlan Tsarnaev lived in Cambridge, not Boston.

| License Photo	MOSCOW, Dec. 31 (UPI) -- Syrian rebels severed one of the civil war-wracked country's major natural gas pipelines, state media reported Monday.The destruction of the pipeline north of the city of Dair Alzour Sunday wiped out production of an estimated 1.5 million cubic meters of natural gas that had fueled fertilizer factors and power generating plants, the Syrian Arab News Agency said.The Los Angeles Times reported rebels had seized oil fields and attacked other strategic targets in an attempt to deprive the Syrian government of much-needed cash. SANA reported Syrian Prime Minister Wael Halqi told lawmakers Monday the attacks, coupled with "unfair economic sanctions" imposed by Western nations, had produced an energy crisis, the Times said.U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi continued his efforts to find an end to the conflict, saying he hoped world leaders could accept a proposal put forth by Russia. Brahimi said Sunday he had discussed the plan with Russia and Syria, RIA Novosti reported."I think this proposal could be adopted by the international community," he said, without providing details.A previous U.N. peace plan collapsed in April.Brahimi could meet with Russia and the United States in January, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said Sunday.Brahimi said the situation in Syria was "getting worse by the day."A total of 133 people, including 12 children and 11 women, died in fighting Monday across Syria, the Syrian Network for Human Rights reported. Fifty-six of the casualties, which were not independently confirmed, were in and around Damascus.On Monday, Turkey dismissed as "disinformation" a report from Iranian Press TV that Syrian forces had captured four Turkish fighter pilots, Today's Zaman reported.Turkey is a former ally of Syria, but asked NATO to deploy anti-missile batteries along its border with its southern neighbors in early December in protest of Syrian President's Bashar Assad's violent attacks against civilians.

| License Photo	April 18 (UPI) -- A video of Cat Cora just before her DUI shows her angry, despite her fault in the accident. According to TMZ, the Iron Chef star was arrested at the scene.The accident took place last month, but the video was just made public. It shows Cora angry at the driver of a car that she rear-ended in Santa Barbara.The driver who videotaped her said he chose to record her because he thought she might have been drunk. Cora blew a .19 on the breathalyzer, which is more than double the limit for drivers in California. She claimed she had consumed only three beers.Cora's DUI made the news last month when her unusually attractive mug shot surfaced. She later released a statement, saying “I deeply regret my decision to drive that evening after my designated driver became unavailable. I learned a very important lesson from this experience and take full accountability for my actions.”

Wiki
Robert Blake (b. September 18, 1933) is an American actor who starred in the film In Cold Blood and the U.S. television series Baretta. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted for the 2001 murder of his wife, but on November 18, 2005, Blake was found liable in a California civil court for her wrongful death.
Blake was born Michael James Vincenzo Gubitosi in Nutley, New Jersey, to Giacomo (James) Gubitosi (1906–1956) and Elizabeth Cafone (b. 1910). His brother was James Gubitosi (1930–1995) and his sister was Giovanna Gubitosi (1932–1985).
His father was born in Italy, arriving in the United States in 1907, and his mother was an Italian-American born in New Jersey. They married in 1929. In 1930, James worked as a die setter for a can manufacturer. Eventually, James and Elizabeth began a song-and-dance act. In 1936, the three children began performing, billed as "The Three Little Hillbillies." They moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1938, where the children began working as movie extras.
