ROME, Dec. 19 (UPI) -- The ground-mapping and target-detection capabilities of the new Gabbiano T-20 radar by Italy's Selex Galileo were demonstrated in recent flight tests.The tests were performed with the system operating from an Elbit Systems Hermes 450 unmanned aerial system.The company said the Gabbiano detected moving targets on the ground at up to 40 nautical miles and delivered high-quality digital images of the terrain."The very low-power-consumption and compact, lightweight design of the Gabbiano Radar makes it ideally suited for a wide range of UAS applications." said Selex Galileo's Head of Airborne Radar Italy Mario Zucchelli."Because of our ownership of the radar design, we're able to continue to add advanced modes to the Gabbiano Radar family, adding a huge amount of value for the customer while remaining cost effective."Selex Galileo said various versions of the Gabbiano radar product line, introduced into service in 2009, have been integrated onto a number of aircraft models, including the Embraer KC390, Beechcraft B350, AW-139 and AW-101 helicopters and several UAS systems, including the Hermes from Elbit.

OXFORD, England, July 16 (UPI) -- The British government says it plans to invest $90 million in the development of an air-breathing rocket engine intended for a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane.The announcement comes after feasibility testing of essential technology conducted by the European Space Agency. The investment, through the United Kingdom Space Agency, will back technical improvements leading to construction of a prototype Synergistic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, or SABRE, an ESA release said Tuesday.Designed by British firm Reaction Engines Ltd, SABRE is designed to use atmospheric air in the early part of the flight before switching to rocket mode for the final ascent to orbit.SABRE is intended to power a 275-foot-long pilot-less vehicle dubbed Skylon, performing the same orbital tasks as today's rockets while operating like an airplane.The British investment decision follow the success of ESA-managed tests of a key element of the SABRE design, a precooler to chill the hot air entering the engine at hypersonic speed."The idea has been around since the 1950s but this is the first time anyone has managed to achieve a working system," Mark Ford, head of ESA's propulsion section, said. "Nobody else has this technology, so Europe has a real technological lead here."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Jan. 29 (UPI) -- Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis Tuesday denied a report he used a deer antler extract that contains a banned performance-enhancing substance.Mitch Ross, the owner of Sports with Alternatives to Steroids, based in Alabama, said in a Sports Illustrated report published Tuesday he provided "about 40 bottles" of the deer antler spray -- which contains the growth hormone IGF-1 -- to Lewis last year as the 13-time Pro Bowl linebacker was recovering from a torn triceps.SI reported Ross produced a recording of a conversation with Lewis in which the Ravens star tells Ross to "just pile me up and just send me everything you got, because I got to get back on this this week."Like the banned human growth hormone, IGF-1 is detectable only by blood tests, which NFL players are not yet required to take as the players' union and the league negotiate ground rules for them.Lewis -- the Most Valuable Player in Super Bowl XXXV -- initially sidestepped questions about the story Tuesday in New Orleans, where the Ravens are preparing to play in Sunday's Super Bowl XLVII, The New York Times reported."Two years ago, that was the same report," he said. "I wouldn't give that report or him any of my press. He's not worthy of that. Next question."However, when asked directly if he had ever used deer-antler velvet extract spray, Lewis said, "Nah, never," the Los Angeles Times reported.

CHICAGO, Nov. 14 (UPI) -- One-time radical William Ayers said Friday the Republican Party "demonized" his militant past to wage a campaign of fear against Barack Obama.The relationship between Ayers, a co-founder of the 1969 to mid-1970s Weather Underground, and the president-elect became a talking point for Republicans during the 2008 campaign, with party operatives and candidates raising questions about the depth of Obama's association with Ayers.The two served together on several boards in Chicago. Ayers is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago."The truth is we came together in Chicago in the civic community around issues of school improvement, around issues of fighting for the rights of poor neighborhoods to have jobs and housing and so on," Ayers said on ABC's "Good Morning America."So this idea that we need to know more like there's some dark, hidden secret -- some secret link -- is just a myth. And it's a, myth thrown up by people who wanted to kind of exploit the politics of fear."He said the two knew each other "in a professional way ... on the same level as, say, thousands of other people."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 (UPI) -- A 100-day scorecard, corporate discipline and a hands-on management style are three things Mitt Romney promised to institute if he's elected U.S. president.Romney, who will be formally nominated as the GOP presidential candidate this week during the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., also said he would treat his Cabinet as a board of directors and it would be dominated by people from the private sector, Politico reported.What people see is what people will get, Romney told Politico during a 30-minute interview.He vowed to keep his focus on a relentlessly goal-driven, business-oriented approach to national government that helped mold his life."I know there are some people who do a very good job acting and pretending they're something they're not," Romney said. "You get what you see. I am who I am."Saying he doesn't think "everybody likes me," Romney said he does believe "people of this country are looking for someone who can get the country growing again with more jobs and more take-home pay, and I think they realize this president had four years to do that. ... He got every piece of legislation he wanted passed, and it didn't work. I think they want someone who has a different record, and I do."Romney also indicated he was tiring of the criticism that he is wooden or wasn't connecting with voters, Politico said. He said he was able to unite people of divergent views to rescue the Olympics, initiate profit-making ideas at Bain Capital and lead Massachusetts, a Democratic state.While acknowledging opposition ads have had some impact, Romney said people would have a chance to get to know him better during the the ensuing weeks and debates "when people are actually paying a lot of attention to the candidates."Romney said he would take a hands-on approach and consider varying viewpoints on an issue before reaching a decision, Politico said.But Romney said his one bugaboo is organization."I think one of the things I don't do terribly well is to be highly organized and follow a calendar precisely," he said.Even though he would take the hands-on approach, Romney said he would delegate responsibilities."Having people who have actually run things in the private sector or who have been actively involved in the private sector will be of real interest to me," he said.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 25 (UPI) -- A first-class U.S. postage stamp will jump 3 cents in price to help the Postal Service make up losses from the Great Recession, the postal regulator said.Similar increases will apply to magazines and advertising mail, the Postal Regulatory Commission said.The hike, raising a first-class stamp to 49 cents from 46 cents, starts Jan. 26 but is temporary, lasting "just long enough to recover the loss," Chairwoman Ruth Goldway said in announcing the increase.She predicted "just long enough" would be close to two years.The independent regulatory commission determined the Postal Service's loss, caused by a substantial 25.3 billion-piece drop in mail volume, was $2.8 billion between 2008 and 2011, Goldway said.The commission in its 2-1 ruling rejected the Postal Service's request to make the increase permanent, saying the service "failed to provide justification for permanent price increases in connection with recession-related mail volume losses."It added the service "conflated losses that are a result of Internet diversion with losses that were a result of the Great Recession" and said the additional postage revenue should cover only recession losses, not deficits stemming from email and commercial package-delivery competition.The post office said last month it lost $5 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The year before it said it lost a record $15.9 billion.The 4.3 percent emergency, or "exigent," increase the commission approved Christmas Eve comes on top of a 1.7 percent inflation increase approved last month. That brings the total increase for most mail to 6 percent.The commission must approve postage increases above those tied to inflation."The Postal Service is disappointed in the Postal Regulatory Commission's split decision to limit the duration of a modest exigent rate increase," the service said in a statement, adding it was reviewing the ruling "in an attempt to determine the basis for the decision."The trade group MPA, the Association of Magazine Media, called the increase a "counterproductive decision" that "does nothing to fix [the Postal Service's] systemic problems," while "hurting consumers, forcing layoffs and impacting businesses."The last time a first-class stamp rose 3 cents was June 30, 2002, when it went to 37 cents from 34 cents.A first-class stamp has been 46 cents since Jan. 27, 2013.

Wiki
Louise Joy Brown (born 25 July 1978, in Oldham, Greater Manchester, UK) is the first person to be conceived by in vitro fertilization, or IVF.
Louise Brown was born to Lesley and John Brown, who had been trying to conceive for nine years, but without success because of blocked fallopian tubes. On 10 November 1977, Lesley Brown underwent a procedure developed by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, later to become known as IVF. Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work.
Brown was born 25 July 1978 at 11:47 p.m. at Oldham General Hospital, Oldham, via planned Caesarean section delivered by registrar John Webster. She weighed 5 pounds, 12 ounces (2.608 kg) at birth. Her younger sister, Natalie Brown, was also conceived through IVF, four years later, and became the world's fortieth IVF baby, and the first one to give birth herself—naturally—in 1999.
