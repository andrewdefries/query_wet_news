| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Sept. 13 (UPI) -- U.S. actress Sara Gilbert says she realized she was gay while she was involved in a flirtation with her "Roseanne" costar Johnny Galecki. Gilbert, 38, discussed her sexuality Thursday on CBS's "The Talk," where she is a co-host and executive producer, the Los Angeles Times reported. Gilbert played Roseanne Barr's daughter on "Roseanne." Galecki, now on "The Big Bang Theory," was her boyfriend and later her husband. On Thursday, she said she found Galecki "super-cute.""We started dating and he would come over and we would make out and then I would start to get depressed," Gilbert said. After she told him she had realized she was a lesbian and was trying to deal with it, Galecki kept her secret for years both from the "Roseanne" cast and from everyone else. She called him to warn him about the revelation she was planning to make."And he was like 'Yeah, no, of course' and 'I love you' and 'I think it's really important' and 'I'm so proud of you,'" she said. Galecki even offered to hold her hand during the show. Gilbert is now engaged to Linda Perry, a musician.

| License Photo	ROME, May 13 (UPI) -- Laura Robson posted a Rome International tennis tournament win Monday over Venus Williams that gives her a match against world No. 1 Serena Williams.The initial draw had set up a potential all-Williams sister second-round match but Robson squashed that with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Venus Williams. Robson, despite facing 12 break points, won nearly 60 percent of the points on serve and lost her serve twice -- once in each set.Robson had three breaks in each set, winning 57 percent of the points when Williams served.That put her in the second round against Serena Williams, who is 31-2 this year.Ninth-seeded Samantha Stosur, the only seeded player on Monday's schedule, advanced with a 6-2, 6-3 decision over Hsieh Su-Wei. Like Robson, Stosur had three breaks in each set.Qualifier Simona Halep ripped Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-1, 6-1 without dropping serve while Sabine Lisicki ousted Mallory Burdette 6-1, 6-2 and Jelena Jankovic stopped Tsvetana Pironkova 6-3, 6-0 by finishing off six of her seven break opportunities.Also in the first round, Nastassja Burnett beat Alize Cornet 6-2, 6-2; Peng Shuai got by Monica Niculescu 4-6, 6-3, 6-2; Ayumi Morita defeated Sorana Cirstea 6-1, 6-3; Kiki Bertens took out Francesca Schiavone 7-6 (7-5), 6-1; Garbine Muguruza took a seesaw 1-6, 6-0, 6-2 result from Mathilde Johansson; and Melanie Oudin advanced with Ekaterina Makarova retired with Oudin ahead 2-6, 7-5, 4-2.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (UPI) -- The National Republican Committee has not declared any truce with Barack Obama as he prepares to become U.S. president, some observers say.While Republicans in Congress like Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky have had praise for the president-elect's appointments, the national committee has released a barrage of critical press releases, The New York Times reports. The overarching theme is that Obama has already betrayed his promises of "change" and "hope.""Obama promised to change America's healthcare system, but his nominee to be secretary is no change agent," the committee said of Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader and Obama's designated secretary of health and human services.Rep. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, is a "partisan insider." David Axelrod, a campaign strategist named senior adviser, is among "partisan bomb-throwers."Amber Wilkerson, a spokeswoman for the RNC, described its role as being a "loyal opposition" when members disagree with Obama."Americans have very high expectations for President-elect Obama, and it's our job to hold him accountable on his promises," she said.

STILLWATER, Okla., Sept. 26 (UPI) -- An eighth-grade student used a handgun to kill himself Wednesday morning at the junior high school in Stillwater, Okla., police said. The boy was identified as Cade Poulos, 13, The Oklahoman reported. He apparently brought a handgun to Stillwater Junior High School. While some students suggested Poulos had been bullied, Anne Caine, the Stillwater school superintendent, said there had been no complaints from him or his family. Caine described him at a news conference as a good student who smiled often. One student told the Stillwater NewsPress that the hallway was crowded when Cade put the gun to his head. He said he was one of the many witnesses. "I saw him on the ground," Aaron Veselak said. "There was blood all around his head." A school resource officer responded after hearing the shot. "Everyone thought it was a joke at first," ninth-grader Ashlyn Lundholm said. "Then I heard people screaming. Then we went to lockdown for 35 to 40 minutes."The shooting occurred at 7:50 a.m., about 10 minutes before the start of the school day. Classes were canceled.

NEW YORK, Nov. 2 (UPI) -- African piracy netted more than $400 million in ransom payments over a seven-year period, said a U.N. report calling for a task force to find the financiers.The report, written by the World Bank and the United Nations, said money raised from piracy is used to fund other criminal activities, the BBC reported Friday.Between 2005 and 2012, piracy raised between $339 million and $413 million in ransoms, but little of the money actually goes to the pirates who seize ships traveling off the Horn of Africa, said the report, titled "Pirate Trails." People who provide the money for the ransom operations get 30 to 50 percent of what is paid in ransom, while the "foot soldiers" get a standard fee that amounts to about 0.1 percent of the total ransom.The financiers invest the ransom money in both legal businesses and illegal activities, moving the money through smuggling, money laundering and wire transfers, the report said.Stuart Yikona, the report's co-author, said money that flows from piracy "has the power to corrupt the regional and international economy."The report recommended improvements in cross-border controls, regional cooperation and the monitoring of money gained from piracy."The international community has mobilized a naval force to deal with the pirates," Yikona said. "A similarly managed multinational effort is needed to disrupt and halt the flow of illicit money that circulates in the wake of their activities."Piracy increases the cost of global trade about $18 billion a year, the United Nations said in a statement. It also has caused declines in tourism and fishing in East African countries since 2006.The report was compiled from interviews with former pirates, government officials, bankers and others involved in fighting piracy. It focused on the countries of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Seychelles and Somalia.

MOSCOW, April 30 (UPI) -- Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was taking emergency action after two missiles were fired at a Russian commercial passenger jet flying over Syria.The Nordwind Airlines Airbus A320 with 159 passengers and eight crew members had to take evasive action to avoid the two surface-to-air missiles fired by unidentified assailants, the non-governmental Interfax news agency said, citing an informed source in Moscow.No one on the chartered plane was injured and the jet full of vacationers returning from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheik landed safely and on time in Kazan, the capital of the Russian republic of Tatarstan, the Russian Federal Agency for Tourism said."The Syrian side informed us that on Monday morning, unidentified forces launched two ground-to-air missiles that exploded in the air very close to a civilian aircraft belonging to a Russian airline," the agency quoted the source as saying."The crew was able to move the aircraft to the side in time, saving the lives of the passengers," the source said.The white commercial aircraft with a deep red tail section is believed to have been intentionally targeted, the source told Interfax, "but it remains unclear whether the attackers knew it was Russian or not."The Foreign Ministry immediately took "emergency measures to clarify all the circumstances of this situation, including making contact with Syrian authorities," ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich was quoted by Interfax as saying.The ministry gave no update on its investigation early Tuesday.Syria's Foreign Ministry and Syrian Armed Forces had no immediate comment, nor did the opposition Syrian National Council or Free Syrian Army.The top executive of Syria's flag-carrier airline was quoted by Russia's government-funded television network RT as saying she knew of no airline attack at all."We contacted the service that monitors traffic within Syrian airspace. None of the air-traffic control services or other ground services at the airports in Damascus and Latakia have confirmed the information of a Russian plane being fired at," Syrian Arab Airlines Director General and Chief Executive Officer Ghaida Abdullatif said.Washington also had no immediate comment.Russia is one of the staunchest allies of the embattled regime of President Bashar Assad, which is fighting to retain control of Syria amid a civil war that he seen more than 70,000 people killed.

| License Photo	Dec. 8 (UPI) -- We last saw R. Kelly playing a woman like a violin to a collection of songs from his latest baby-maing album, Black Panties, on Jimmy Kimmel Live, so he might not be the first musician that comes to mind for Nelson Mandela tributes. But the 46-year-old singer hit the Arsenio stage on Thursday with a very poignant performance of "Soldier's Heart," a song he wrote especially for Mandela back in 2003. Kelly told Arsenio Hall that he had once played the song for the revolutionary icon at his home in South Africa."And I sang a special song for him on his piano. I'm just blessed to know that I walked in his presence," Kelly said. "And being around him inspired me to even go further in my life in my walk and my career and everything, man. He's just an incredible power.""He just nodded his head, man," Kelly said of his reaction to the song. "He was very happy and very honored, as I was being in his presence. When I started performing the song on his piano, it was an unbelievable moment for me, man, as it is now.""Soldier's Heart" hit the airwaves in 2003 as a benefit single for American veterans.
