GAINESVILLE, Fla., May 7 (UPI) -- So-called hot Jupiter-type planets orbiting distant stars are likely alone in their systems, research by a University of Florida astronomer and others found.Hot Jupiters, giant planets roughly the size of Jupiter but orbiting close to their parent stars -- and thus much hotter than Earth or Jupiter -- have short orbital periods, speeding around their parent stars in fewer than 10 days, astronomer Eric Ford said.Ford and other researchers analyzed data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, looked for signs of additional planets either crossing in front of the host stars or gravitationally tugging on the orbits of hot Jupiters, but found no evidence of additional planets, a university release reported Monday.Astronomers say they believe hot Jupiters are solitary because of the way they form.They are probably formed far from their host star in highly elongated orbits. Researchers say that causes them to pass very close to the host star and then travel far away.The star's gravitational forces affect the planet, causing its orbit to become smaller and more circular, they said -- a process that would remove or destroy other low-mass planets that may have formed initially between the star and the giant planet."When a giant planet repeatedly passes through the inner regions of a planetary system on an elongated orbit, it would wreak great havoc on any planets that had formed there," Ford said. "The other planets would either fall into the star, collide with the hot Jupiter or be kicked out of the system via a gravitational slingshot."

WASHINGTON, April 12 (UPI) -- U.S. immigration policy is "unfit for today's world," Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said in starting an advocacy group that seeks to change the U.S. economy."We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants. And it's a policy unfit for today's world," he said in a Washington Post op-ed announcing Fwd.us, a bipartisan political advocacy group also supported by more than two dozen prominent technology leaders, including Google Inc. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and Yahoo Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer."My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer," Zuckerberg wrote. "My parents are doctors. I started a company. None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world's leading scientific community that created the Internet."Today's students should have the same opportunities," he said.Fwd.us -- pronounced "Forward U.S." -- is run by former Zuckerberg Harvard University roommate Joe Green and will have offices in California's Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. The Washington office will be led by campaign manager Rob Jesmer, a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.The technology leaders started Fwd.us -- which had more than 17,000 Facebook "Likes" early Friday and more than 2,300 Twitter followers -- because the United States has shifted to a "knowledge economy" based on ideas from an economy "primarily based on natural resources, industrial machines and manual labor," Zuckerberg, 28, said in his commentary.Unlike 20th century resources, knowledge and ideas "are renewable and available to everyone."In this new economy, "we need the most talented and hardest-working people. We need to train and attract the best," he said.Fwd.us has three immediate priorities, he said: comprehensive immigration reform that provides a clear path to citizenship; education reform to press for higher standards in schools and a "much greater focus" on math and sciences; and increased investment to create "breakthrough discoveries in scientific research and assurance that the benefits of the inventions belong to the public and not just to the few.""We will work with members of Congress from both parties, the administration and state and local officials," Zuckerberg said. "We will use online and offline advocacy tools to build support for policy changes, and we will strongly support those willing to take the tough stands necessary to promote these policies in Washington."Fwd.us has raised $25 million and seeks to double that amount, the Los Angeles Times reported.Its consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the political aisle are also expected to press other agenda items of the technology industry, the newspaper said.

STANLEY, Falkland Islands , Feb. 14 (UPI) -- A trawler loaded with fish and 500 tons of fuel that sank off the coast of the Falkland Islands is not posing an environmental risk, a fisheries official says.John Barton, director of fisheries in the Falklands, told a meeting of the Fisheries Committee this week any fuel surfacing from the Ferramales, which went down Feb. 2 about 70 miles north of the islands, should dissipate quickly, Mercopress reported Wednesday.The vessel's 32 crew members got into life rafts and were rescued by another trawler. An investigation into the maritime mishap was being conduced by the Falklands' marine officer, Penguin News reported.Ship Capt. Jose Santos, who returned to Spain with the several Spanish members of the crew, told reporters in Vigo that "terrible weather and the fact the vessel was loaded with fish made it very difficult to control the situation."

STANFORD, Fla., May 11 (UPI) -- George Zimmerman's lawyer is seeking to have some information related to his client's Florida trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin withheld from the media.Defense attorney Mark O'Mara is expected to be provided with evidence in the case Monday, The Miami Herald reported.O'Mara requested that the judge in the case to seal the case file, but Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester declined to do so. O'Mara then said he would like some of the information in the evidence, such as the names of witnesses, to be blacked out before evidence is made publicly available.Zimmerman is charged with second degree murder for the February shooting death of Martin, who was unarmed. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty and claimed he shot Martin in self defense."There has been a lot of animosity and emotions caused by incomplete and premature disclosure of information. Because those emotions still run so high, we want to do everything we can to protect the sanctity of the process and the safety of the witnesses," O'Mara said in a statement last month. "No good purpose will be served by a media frenzy directed at witnesses."By law, evidence in criminal cases must be made public once it is provided to the defense. In Zimmerman's case, lawyers were granted an extension while O'Mara writes a motion to the judge asking for special consideration for issues such as redacting witness names from documents."Public release of the of the [evidence] may be delayed as we may be filing a motion to further redact information, and an opportunity to review the discovery is necessary to determine the applicability of that motion. While we understand the frustration of those who want to view the information as soon as possible, we believe that Mr. Zimmerman's right to a fair trial, decided by an impartial, unbiased jury is paramount," O'Mara wrote on his Web site.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 2 (UPI) -- California's prisons chief agreed to meet with advocates for inmates staging a nearly 4-week-old hunger strike over conditions in solitary confinement.Ron Ahnen, president of the Oakland-based group California Prison Focus, called the move "progress," the Los Angeles Times reported.Ahnen was one of the activists to meet Friday with Jeffrey Beard, Gov. Jerry Brown's appointed head of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Other meeting participants included a representative from the American Friends Service Committee.The meeting was on the 26th day of the protest, which officials said had about 500 participants Thursday. Of the protesting inmates, 331 have refused meals since the strike began July 8.Department spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman downplayed the meeting's significance, saying, "You can call it discussions."From the start, state officials have insisted they would not negotiate with protest leaders, the Times said. Officials said the protest was organized by prison gangs seeking better opportunities to operate within California's penal system.Last week, lower-level administrators sought feedback from Pelican Bay State Prison protest leaders in a process being developed to review solitary confinement cases.

ANKARA, Turkey, March 10 (UPI) -- Turkish officials said more than 200,000 Syrian refugees have flooded over the border to escape two years of violence to oust President Bashar Assad. An estimated 186,000 refugees are living in camps over the border in Turkey, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said. The camps are being managed by the Turkish government with support from the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, or UNHCR.The U.N. commission is operating similar camps in Jordan where still more Syrian refugees have fled, Today's Zaman said.The number of Syrian refugees could double or even triple by year's end if the conflict continues, UNHCR chief Antonio Guterres said, and called for greater international support for the refugees and their hosts."We need to be prepared for the increasing numbers of Syrians," he said. "The international community should share the burden with Turkey because this is a collective responsibility, not only the responsibility of Turkey."

| License Photo	(UPI) -- Ruben Studdard revealed on the season premiere of "The Biggest Loser" that while he’s on the show to lose weight, it won’t be from shaving his back. Known as the Velvet Teddy Bear, Studdard showed off some back fur to trainer Jillian Michaels when he got shirtless and hopped in an ice bath following his first intense day in the gym."We're going to have to wax that back of yours, I'm telling you right now," Michaels said."Let me tell you something, baby. That's the real man in me," said Studdard, 35, who began the competition at 462 pounds. "You understand me?"Michaels did not. "It's not even [just] back hair -- there's an inch-and-a-half of shoulder hair! That is totally unacceptable!"Studdard, who won the second season of "American Idol," cautioned that Michaels had "womanized men" by pressuring them into going bare"Jillian is a hater," he told the camera. "I don't appreciate that. You know, I think everything about Ruben Studdard is sexy."
