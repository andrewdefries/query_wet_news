NEW YORK, May 9 (UPI) -- The Season 2 premiere episode of the New York-set private-detective series "Elementary" is to be shot in London this summer, CBS announced Thursday.The drama stars Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu as contemporary incarnations of 19th century literary figures Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.CBS said the show's second season premiere episode will be shot in London in July. This will mark the first time the series, which imagines Sherlock as a brilliant sleuth and recovering drug addict, has been taped on location outside of New York. Liu's Watson is a former surgeon and sober companion who assists Holmes in solving mysteries. "We couldn't be more excited to have this opportunity to see Sherlock's old stomping grounds and take a closer look at a life that, until now, we've only been able to glimpse through the lens of his recovery," the show's executive producer and creator Robert Doherty said in a statement. "By meeting old friends and revisiting prior cases, Watson will gain even more insight into Holmes. She'll have to keep up with a Sherlock who is both more comfortable in his surroundings and even bolder in testing the limits of those around him."

LAGOS, Nigeria, Nov. 26 (UPI) -- Four girls at a Nigerian school have developed an electricity generator powered by urine in response to the country's energy problems.The girls, students at the Doregos Private Academy School in Lagos, said they developed the urine-powered generator due to the difficulty in finding fuel to power the generators many people in the country rely on due to the country's frequent outages, Radio France Internationale reported Monday."We noticed that many Nigerians, [those whose] businesses depend on a power supply have virtually been put out of business because of the high cost of power, so we decided to make a device that will reduce this problem. We noticed that waste products can be used to generate energy that is why we decided to experiment on urine," said Eniola Bello, one of the students.The girls said the generator is powered by the hydrogen and oxygen released by the urine.Adebola Duro-Aina, another student on the team, said about 1 1/2 gallons of urine can power the generator for about 36 hours."This urine is being electrolyzed, releasing hydrogen and oxygen gas, and this then goes into our gas tank. Our gas tank here stores the gases, and anytime we need the gas we can open up the gas tank and release the gas and our generator is powered," she said.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 (UPI) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday the military assessment of progress in Iraq and projected troop drawdown was "more of the same."During two days of testimony before House of Representatives and Senate committees, U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus said he has recommended U.S. combat forces be lowered to the pre-surge level of about 130,000.But Reid, D-Nev., said at a news conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the general's projected reduction in combat troops was "more of the same" rhetoric indicating an extended U.S. combat troop involvement.During his news briefing, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said, "I think what you have seen ... (is) a series of trend lines that have been promising" in reducing the violence and building support for a democratic system of government."All of these are signs that the Iraqis want peace," Snow said, adding he did not know what Bush's comments on the assessment by Petraeus and would be.Pelosi, when asked about the Democrat-controlled Congress' inability to change the course of the war, said, "We have changed the debate on Iraq ... and are holding this administration accountable."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, June 16 (UPI) -- A survivor of the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood said he remained bitter the accused gunman was able to remain in the U.S. Army despite some ominous behavior.Maj. Nadal Hasan had come under FBI scrutiny after reportedly making e-mail contact with a radical Muslim cleric with links to al-Qaida in the weeks prior to the deadly shooting spree. However, he remained on active duty."You could lose your security clearance in the Army for having bad credit and be kicked out of the Army. But you can't lose your security clearance for talking to a member of al-Qaida, through e-mail. It doesn't make any sense," Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning told FoxNews.com.Manning, who was shot six times in the melee, said he did not consider Hasan to be an officer and fellow soldier but rather one of the "domestic enemies" he swore an oath to defend the United States against."He tried to kill soldiers," said Manning. "I mean, he was an enemy -- plain and simple."Hasan was charged with killing 13 people and injuring 43. Another survivor, Pvt. George Stratton, told Fox he and other wounded troops experienced a moment of dread when someone yelled out that the gunman was coming back to shoot the wounded."I just sat there," Stratton said. "(I) felt hopeless waiting for this person to come in and finish the job."Stratton and Manning were interviewed for the first time since the incident for an upcoming episode of "Fox Files," FoxNews.com said.

CAIRO, June 22 (UPI) -- Egypt's embattled president said in a newspaper interview Saturday he would not step down and would serve out his term, which ends in 2016.Mohamed Morsi told the state-owned Al-Akhbar he planned to remain in office to ensure any handover of power takes place in accordance to the Egyptian constitution, and warned that some political movements inside and outside Egypt were bent on derailing the nation's fledgling democracy."Egypt, as a major country with strong influence in the region, is an obvious target," Morsi said. "In light of the current political situation, the attempts to interfere in our affairs are increasing, but I do not accept that and will work to stand against it."Morsi said new details on the reputed plots would be made public in the near future. He said the ultimate goal of these pressures was to turn back the clock to an era of "corruption, forging election results, plundering funds and repressing freedoms."Morsi also faces public pressure to resign from ongoing demonstrations in the streets. Ahram Online said mass protests planned for June 30 and a nationwide petition call for snap elections.A current sore point among demonstrators is a slate of governorship appointments made by Morsi last week. Ahram Online said critics say Morsi selected too many members of the Muslim Brotherhood.Morsi defended his appointments, particularly the new governor of the tourist city of Luxor, who was linked to a militant group responsible for the 1997 terrorist attack that killed 62 Egyptians and foreign tourists.

| License Photo	Dec. 4 (UPI) -- French troops are en route to the Central African Republic in anticipation of a United Nations Security Council vote later this week that will authorize an African Union-led force partly comprised of French troops.The U.N. resolution allows for 3,600 soldiers under the auspices of the African Union and deployment of an additional 1,000 French troops to augment the French force of 400 already in-country. The resolution will be set to a vote on Thursday. Some French troops are already on their way to the violence-ravaged country, making their way through Cameroon while French military supplies were flown directly into Bangui.France has suggested a mini-summit to be held this Saturday as an opportunity for regional countries to discuss possible solutions to the crisis in the Central African Republic. One senior African official responded to the summit idea with the suggestion that the agenda also includes "what would be the political solution after the military intervention finishes."The Central African Republic has been rocked by violence since Seleka, a Muslim-backed group, took control of the capital in March and removed Christian President François Bozizé.
