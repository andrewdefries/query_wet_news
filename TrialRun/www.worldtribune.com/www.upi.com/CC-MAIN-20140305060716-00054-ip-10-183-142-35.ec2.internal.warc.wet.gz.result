MIASS, Russia, Sept. 6 (UPI) -- Police who allegedly failed to provide proper security at a Russian rock festival face a criminal investigation, an official says.Russia's top investigator, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered the investigation as a result of violence at an event in the Ural Mountains, RIA Novosti reported Monday.About 30 people were injured when about 150 men armed with clubs and guns with rubber bullets attacked police and spectators at the Tornado-2010 rock fest in Miass on Aug. 29, the report said."The Investigative Committee's chief (Bastrykin) ordered to launch a criminal case against the police officers who failed to ensure proper security at the Tornado festival," spokesman Vladimir Markin said. Concert organizers said proper security was provided for the festival but they were unprepared for such an attack.About 6,000 people attended the festival.The attack might have occurred as a result of political differences, officials said.The event's organizer, Valikhan Turgumbayev, is running for office in a legislative election and some said he used the festival to campaign.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, April 15 (UPI) -- With so many major decisions ready to drop at the U.S. Supreme Court before the justices rise for their summer recess in late June, it's easy to forget that one of the biggest disputes, the Obama administration's challenge to Arizona's stringent immigration law, has yet to be heard.Lawyers for each side butt heads in Washington in Arizona vs. United States on April 25, the last argument day of the term. A loss for the Obama administration in the Arizona case, like a putative loss in the federal healthcare law challenge, would be a body blow to President Obama's re-election efforts.Justice Elena Kagan has withdrawn from the Arizona case, citing her previous work as U.S. solicitor general, lowering the odds for an administration victory.Meanwhile, what's going on back in Arizona? The squabbles at the high court seem to be mirrored in clashes in Arizona. It's not a great time to be a state Republican.Ignore the bad blood between Republican Gov. Jan Brewer and President Obama, who greet each other in public like old foes trying to borrow a cup of bile.The FBI is conducting a massive investigation of state Attorney General Tom Horne, who with Brewer brought the immigration law case to the Supreme Court.Horne is a popular Republican office holder who has had a little trouble in the past. In the course of a bankruptcy, Horne was slapped with a lifetime trading ban in 1970 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Now, the Arizona Capitol Times reports, the FBI investigation of Horne goes beyond claims by a whistle-blower -- a former friend and a current assistant -- Horne promised a job to Kathleen Winn, the woman who headed an independent committee that supported him.The newspaper said the FBI was investigating Horne in January, a month before the former friend filed his whistle-blower complaint. The FBI is investigating an allegation the Horne colluded with the "independent" committee during his 2010 campaign. That would be a violation of Arizona election law. The promise of a job would violate federal law, but a source told the Capitol Times the FBI and the Justice Department wouldn't be wasting their time on something as minor as that.Though no one is saying publicly exactly what the FBI is looking at, agents recently have focused on corruption in other cases."What little we do know about the investigation so far is that the FBI has requested information on Horne's finances -- both for his campaign and in his personal life," the Capitol Times reports.Another major Arizona law enforcement figure, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, is a target of the U.S. Justice Department's investigations.Arpaio, a 79-year-old Italian-American transplant from Massachusetts bills himself as "America's toughest sheriff." He's famous for introducing tent cities, chain gangs and pink underwear to his overcrowded jail population.The sheriff also has joined the "birther" movement -- the discredited attempt to prove that Obama wasn't born in the United States, and therefore is ineligible to serve as president, despite the presidential election.Mainjustice.com reports the Justice Department has broken off negotiations with Arpaio to settle a case brought about by a three-year federal investigation. The department wrote sheriff's office lawyers that the Maricopa office refused to agree to an independent monitor, a necessary ingredient for any settlement of allegations of racial profiling of Hispanics, discriminatory jail practices and unlawful retaliation -- complain and you'll regret it.Arpaio courts a reputation as a hard-liner on illegal immigration."It was disappointing, to say the least, for you to contact us 24 hours before our negotiations were scheduled to continue and raise, for the first time, a precondition that you understood would would result in the cancellation of negotiations -- and by extension, the initiation of a civil lawsuit -- and calls into question whether you were ever interested in settling this matter," Roy Austin, deputy attorney general in the civil rights division, wrote to Arpaio's department, mainjustice reports.The precondition? The rejection of any monitor."I am [a] constitutionally and legitimately elected sheriff, and I absolutely refuse to surrender my responsibility to the federal government," Arpaio said in a statement. The sheriff said the Obama administration was trying to "strong arm me into submission only for its political gain," and "This will not happen; not on my watch."Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery told the Arizona Republic the state "is not the federal government's playground for you to come in here and throw around accusations and assertions and not back it up. If they provide this information, I'll take back everything I just said."Back in Washington, in the larger fight over who gets to do what about illegal immigration, the finals briefs have arrived at the U.S. Supreme Court in preparation for the April 25 argument. They are important -- the justices usually refuse to hear arguments on which they haven't been briefed.The Obama administration had challenged the state law, saying it usurped the role of the federal government. A federal judge agreed in part and issued an injunction against key parts of the law. A federal appeals court panel then decided the judge had the authority to issue the injunction.The injunction bars enforcement of provisions of the law requiring police officers to question people about their immigration status during routine law enforcement operations, if officers have reason to suspect people are not in the United States legally.The injunction also blocks a provision that criminalizes failure to apply for or carry alien registration papers, and a third that makes it illegal "for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for or perform work." Another blocked a provision that allowed police to arrest legal aliens thought to have committed a deportable act.There is no question that Arizona has suffered from illegal immigration. Even U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, who issued the injunction, conceded the state law was enacted against "a backdrop of rampant illegal immigration, escalating drug and human trafficking crimes and serious public safety concerns."Arizona also says it has spent more than $760 million to jail illegal immigrants.In its merit brief to the high court, Arizona says it "enacted the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act ... to address the illegal immigration crisis in the state"Arizona argues in the brief that there is no usurpation of the federal role."This is an implied pre-emption case," the state says in its merit brief. "As such, there must be some clear conflict between a federal statute and [the state law]. The failure of federal law to authorize Arizona's efforts in express terms is beside the point. Arizona officials have inherent authority to enforce federal law and such cooperative law enforcement is the norm, not something that requires affirmative congressional authorization. [State law] does not impose its own substantive immigration standards, but simply uses state resources to enforce federal rules."In its brief for the United States, the Obama administration said: "Arizona has adopted its own immigration policy, which focuses solely on maximum enforcement and pays no heed to the multifacted judgments that the [Immigration and Nationality Act] provides for the executive branch."For each state, and each locality, to set its own immigration policy in that fashion would subvert Congress' goal [in the act]: a single, national approach."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Al-Jazeera agreed to buy the struggling Current TV current affairs channel partly owned by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and start a 24-hour news channel.Time Warner Cable Inc., the No. 2 U.S. cable operator, immediately said it would drop the channel.The sale's purchase price was undisclosed, but people with knowledge of the deal told The New York Times it was around $500 million, meaning Gore would receive about $100 million for his 20 percent Current ownership.Al-Jazeera, owned by a Qatar government media subsidiary, said it plans to shut down Current, based in San Francisco, and start an English-language news channel in New York called al-Jazeera America.The channel, which the Times said would likely be available in more than 40 million homes, would start later this year, with newscasts emanating from both New York and Doha, Qatar, al-Jazeera said.Roughly 60 percent of the programming would be produced in the United States, with the balance coming from al-Jazeera's Doha-based English-language international news channel, al-Jazeera English.Al-Jazeera -- which already has bureaus in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago -- intends to open several more in other U.S. cities and double its U.S. staff to more than 300 employees.Current co-founder lawyer-businessman Joel Hyatt said in a letter to Current employees -- including some who are expected to lose their jobs -- that he, Gore and the other Current owners agreed to sell to al-Jazeera in part because "al-Jazeera was founded with the same goals we had for Current," including "to give voice to those whose voices are not typically heard" and "to speak truth to power."He said he and Gore would join the al-Jazeera America advisory board.Al-Jazeera said in a statement it wanted to start the U.S. news channel because almost 40 percent of al-Jazeera English's global online viewing comes from the United States."U.S. viewers have clearly demonstrated that they like the way al-Jazeera provides ... news," Director General Ahmed bin Jassim al-Thani said.Al-Jazeera first went on the air Nov. 1, 1996, as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel and has since expanded into a 24-hour news network with several outlets, including Web and specialty TV channels in multiple languages.It also plans to start Turkish-language al-Jazeera Turk this year, it said.The network became known in the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks for its Arabic-language outlet, which aired videos of Osama bin Laden.Since then, al-Jazeera English, which started in 2006, has gained recognition for its international coverage, although U.S. cable and satellite distributors have largely refused to carry the channel, the Times said, so it is available on television only in several U.S. cities.The Times said al-Jazeera executives convinced Gore, Hyatt and the other Current owners it had the journalistic strength and financial backing to compete head-to-head with CNN and other U.S. news channels.Current was started Aug. 1, 2005, after Gore and Hyatt bought small U.S. cable news channel Newsworld International from France's Vivendi Universal, now Vivendi SA.The channel remained fairly obscure, showing viewer-submitted videos and documentaries, but broke through somewhat in 2011 when it shifted its format and hired Keith Olbermann, who brought his popular MSNBC program "Countdown" to the network.Olbermann went on the air June 20, 2011, and was fired March 30, 2012, replaced by former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.Current made ratings headway but on a typical night last year still only attracted an average viewership of 42,000 households, Nielsen Media Research said.By contrast, Time Warner Inc.'s CNN has averaged about 700,000 households during prime time since late September, and Fox News Channel drew about 1.9 million, Nielsen said. Time Warner Cable, the largest cable provider in New York and Los Angeles, took advantage of a change-in-ownership clause and said in a statement Wednesday night it would remove the service "as quickly as possible.""Our agreement with Current has been terminated and we will no longer be carrying the service," the cable provider said.It earlier warned it might drop Current because of its low ratings.

| License Photo	PARK CITY, Utah, June 6 (UPI) -- Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said prospects for stability "retreated" during Hillary Clinton's tenure as U.S. secretary of state.In an interview with CNN this week in Park City, Utah, Romney discussed possible contenders in the 2016 presidential election, including Clinton, a Democrat, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on the Republican side.He said Clinton will have to answer for "the record of American foreign policy" during her term in office."We'll look at everything from North Korea to Iran to Pakistan, to Afghanistan, to Syria, to Egypt and you look across the world, and our prospects -- the prospects for stability, for liberal democracy, for freedom, have retreated over the period of her administration in the Department of State."Romney said Christie has been a "very effective" governor in dealing with superstorm Sandy and working with Democrats in the state Capitol."You have to look at Chris and say this is a guy who's been a very effective governor and has a great potential for leadership," Romney said.He praised Ryan, his 2012 running mate, calling the chairman of the House Budget Committee "one of the great vice presidential nominees in history," and called Paul "a very strong emerging voice in the Republican Party."He said the three are very different from one another and the 2016 contest for the nomination will give Republicans a chance to decide "what we think the right path will be."

| License Photo	TEHRAN, Sept. 29 (UPI) -- Iran is mulling legal action against CNN, alleging it falsified President Hassan Rouhani's statements in an interview with the American network, officials said."After distorting the statements of our country's president, now CNN must be banned and proper legal action needs to be taken in this regard," the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Alledin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Iranian Parliament's National and Security Foreign Policy Commission, saying Saturday."This action by the CNN meant betrayal of trust and it can be pursued and protested," he said.He was referring to a Sept.24 interview by the network's Christiane Amanpour with Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. Amanpour asked the Iranian president if unlike his predecessor, he recognized the Holocaust.Iran claims the translation of the CNN interview that appeared on the screen contained several words and sentences that were not mentioned by Rouhani and alleged his statements on the Holocaust were falsified and fabricated, the news agency said.Fars said the CNN translation was: "I've said before that I am not a historian and then, when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust, it is the historians that should reflect on it. But in general I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity, including the crime that Nazis committed towards the Jews as well as non-Jews is reprehensible and condemnable, Whatever criminality they committed against the Jews we condemn, the taking of human life is contemptible, it makes no difference whether that life is Jewish life, Christian or Muslim, for us it is the same, but taking the human life is something our religion rejects but this doesn't mean that on the other hand you can say Nazis committed crimes a against a group now therefore, they must usurp the land of another group and occupy it. This too is an act that should be condemned."Fars offered a different translation of Rouhani's response:"I have said before that I am not a historian and historians should specify, state and explain the aspects of historical events, but generally we fully condemn any kind of crime committed against humanity throughout the history, including the crime committed by the Nazis both against the Jews and non-Jews, the same way that if today any crime is committed against any nation or any religion or any people or any belief, we condemn that crime and genocide. Therefore, what the Nazis did is condemned, (but) the aspects that you talk about, clarification of these aspects is a duty of the historians and researchers, I am not a history scholar."Fars said CNN has ignored a request to correct the translation, air it again and issue an apology.

| License Photo	April 3 (UPI) -- Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice was fired Wednesday a day after a video showing him physically and verbally abusing his players aired on ESPN.“I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice,” said Rutgers Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Tim Pernetti. “Dismissal and corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong. Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.”The video, which showed Rice berating, shoving and shouting gay slurs at players had parents, players and even New Jersey Governor Chris Christie calling for his head.School officials first became aware of the video last November. After an internal investigation, Rice was suspended for three games and fined $50,000. But after Rice's behavior went public, public pressure on the university to fire him skyrocketed."Governor Christie saw the video today for the first time and he is obviously deeply disturbed by the conduct displayed and strongly condemns this behavior," said a statement released by the governor's office. "It’s not the type of leadership we should be showing our young people and clearly there are questions about this behavior that need to be answered by the leaders at Rutgers University."NBA superstar LeBron James weighed in, telling his nearly 8 million Twitter fans he would "whoop on" Rice if his own son had been one of Rice's players.If my son played for Rutgers or a coach like that he would have some real explaining to do and I'm still gone whoop on him afterwards! C'mon— LeBron James (@KingJames) April 2, 2013
A reader poll by Today found 96 percent say Rice should be fired for his behavior.The video shows Rice throwing a basketball at a player's head, shoving and yelling "f---ing fairy, f---ing fa--ot" at them."Honestly, we've dealt with this issue," said Rutgers athletics director Tim Pernetti, defending his decision not to fire Rice in December. "I would tell you that all options were on the table [including firing] at the time."A lawyer for Eric Murdock, the former director of basketball development at Rutgers whose contract was not renewed after he complained to Pernetti about Rice's behavior, gave the video to ESPN. Murdock was on Rice's staff for two years and has filed a wrongful termination suit against the university. Three players had transferred because of the abuse, Murdock said on ESPN's "Outside the Lines" Tuesday."Yeah, I was in total shock this guy wasn't fired," he said.For some of Rice's players, however, it was easy to chalk Rice's abuse up to acceptable coaching style."Looking back at it now, it was extreme," Mike Coburn, who played for the Scarlet Knights during Rice's first year, told the Times of New Jersey. "It wasn't right what he was doing. But we understood it. He was trying his best."
"Did he go overboard? Yes, he went overboard. But you can't get a good feel for what went down by seeing highlights on ESPN. No one was scared of coach Rice. We didn't fear him. We just understood him."
