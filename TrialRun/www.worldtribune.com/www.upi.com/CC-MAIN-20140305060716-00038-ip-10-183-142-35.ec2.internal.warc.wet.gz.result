| License Photo	French automaker Peugeot, under pressure from the new Socialist government of French President Francois Hollande, still plans to close a plant near Paris.Peugeot Citroen PSA announced this month it would close a plant in Aulnay, north of Paris, and layoff 8,000 of its domestic French workforce of about 80,000 employees to bring production costs down. Hollande called the job cuts "unacceptable" and told the cash-strapped carmaker to go back and talk to its unions. Last week, Peugeot management did and said it would press ahead with restructuring but work to soften the impact of any job losses and the closure of the assembly plant, The Wall Street Journal said.Peugeot Wednesday reported a loss of 819 million euros ($990 million) in the first six months of 2012 as car sales in Europe sag amid economic uncertainty fueled by Greece and Spain.The French government unveiled a 500 million euro ($605 million) recovery plan for a struggling domestic auto industry that includes a higher consumer incentive for consumers who buy clean green-technology plug-in electric or hybrid vehicles. The French auto industry employs about 600,000 people. France's Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg had warned Peugeot not to expect government assistance unless it was willing to make concessions."I pledged that there will be no forced layoffs and that we will do what is necessary to reindustrialize the Aulnay site." said Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin after meeting face-to-face with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. Ayrault also demanded assurances the underutilized assembly plant would be redeveloped, the Journal said.Peugeot is France's second-largest automaker after Renault, which is partly owned by the French government from previous government bailouts, and is Europe's No. 2 automaker by volume after Germany's Volkswagen.Job reductions at the Aulnay plant apparently will be accomplished through attrition, reassignment and outplacement of workers to other employers rather than immediate painful layoffs. Wage freezes are likely.Last week, Peugeot reached a partnership agreement with Toyota to use a plant in Sevelnord in northern France to assemble Toyota-branded delivery vans for sale in Europe as Toyota moves production out of Japan because of the strong yen. The companies already have a joint partnership producing small passenger cars in the Czech Republic.2025 U.S. mileage standards ready to be finalizedThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Safety Administration expect the Obama administration to finalize proposed 2017-2015 fleet fuel-efficiency standards by mid-August.The proposed Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency, or CAFE, rules would require automakers to produce vehicles that average 54.5 mpg by 2025.NHTSA said the White House Office of Management and Budget would complete its review by Aug. 14, about two weeks later than the administration had planned. Thirteen major auto companies, including Ford, GM and Chrysler, signed on to the tough new mileage proposals last year even though automakers said the requirements could cost the industry nearly $158 billion. Industry experts estimate the new mileage standards could add $3,000 to the cost of an average vehicle through 2025.The Congressional Budget Office in May projected improved fuel efficiency would cut gas tax revenue by $57 billion through 2025, The Detroit News said, and recommended an 18.4 cent per gallon hike in the federal gasoline tax to pay for road repairs and construction.Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney told the News in a recent interview: "The best approach is to try to build vehicles that people want, rather than having the government telling the companies what they must make." Fuel economy ranked as the top concern of new car buyers in a Consumer Reports survey released in June, with two-thirds of respondents saying their next car would have to get better mileage than their current vehicle.German automakers have claimed the proposed CAFE standards are tilted to favor U.S. automakers.Consumers waiting for a battery breakthroughReaching the 300-mile range on a single charge is becoming the Holy Grail for electric car battery technology, and so far no battery has come near that mark.The New York Times last week reported scientists at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland have demonstrated a stable lithium-air battery pack with four to 10 times more energy storage capacity than conventional lithium-ion batteries."We need to go beyond the 300-mile driving range for EVs [electric vehicles]," chemistry professor Peter Bruce told the Times in a telephone interview, "so we need a transformational shift. Lithium-air batteries have potential to provide it."Science magazine said the lithium-air battery pack only lost 5 percent of its electrical capacity over 100 charge-discharge cycles in a laboratory.But Bruce said the lithium-air cell still has a long way to go."We're just now trying to address the fundamental science challenges," he added.Ford's first plug-in: the C-Max EnergiFord engineers say the Detroit automaker's first plug-in hybrid, the 2013 C-Max Energi, will have combined range about 550 miles, the gasoline equivalent of 95 mpg.Ford recently drove a C-Max from Sacramento to San Diego without stopping for fuel, The Detroit News reported. The C-Max can go about 20 miles in electric-only mode before its 2-liter, 188-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine takes over -- that's about double the battery-only range of Toyota's plug-in Prius, which has a combined range of about 540 miles.The C-Max will sell for $29,995 after a $3,750 federal tax credit when it goes on sale this fall.The 2013 plug-in Chevrolet Volt gets an expanded range of 380 miles -- 38 miles on battery power only -- when it becomes available in showrooms in August.High traffic deaths upTraffic deaths took a 13.5 percent jump from January through March, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.NHTSA estimates there were 7,630 traffic fatalities on U.S. roadways from vehicle crashes in the first quarter, compared to 6,720 during the first three months of 2011 -- the largest quarterly increase in traffic deaths since 1979.The Detroit News said unusually mild winter may have increased road deaths in 2012 because people took advantage of the warmer weather to drive more."The winter of 2012 was also unseasonably warmer than usual in the most areas of the country," NHTSA said. "Consequently, the fatality rate for the first quarter should not be used to make inferences for the fatality rate for the whole of 2012." Traffic deaths had declined for the last five years and were down 1.7 percent in 2011 to 32,310.

JUNEAU, Alaska, Dec. 11 (UPI) -- Officials in Alaska said they met with South Korean executives to review prospects for Asian exports of liquefied natural gas.Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell met with Kangsoo Choo, the top executive at Korea Gas Corp., or KOGAS, to discuss LNG prospects."These efforts are critical because an Alaska project must compete with other large-scale LNG projects under development around the world," Parnell said in a statement."We have stability and reliability working in our favor and a vast untapped supply, yet we must remain aware of proposed projects in other areas with access to the Pacific Rim."The governor's office said energy companies working in the state, along with TransCanada Corp., are working to commercialize the natural gas reserves in the state's North Slope. KOGAS is the largest purchaser of LNG in the world.Parnell announced last week the state would support North Slope LNG ambitions with $355 million in financing. The financing would support trucking for the 400-mile trek from the North Slope to regasification plants near Fairbanks.Parnell said trucking LNG was the best option for Alaska, saying pipeline options are "some years away."

| License Photo	LONDON, May 7 (UPI) -- Britain's Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy are considering a reconciliation, sources close to the on-again, off-again couple told UsMagazine.com Monday.The prince, 27, and Davy, 26, ended their stormy five-year romance in 2009; however, the young lawyer was friendly towards Harry when she attended the wedding of his brother to Kate Middleton last year. "They're not dating again, but they are seeing each other," an insider told the celebrity news Web site about Harry and his former flame. "There's definitely a romantic connection still. They will never be 'just friends' -- both of them admit that's impossible."The source said the root of the tension between the two is Harry's service in the military, which frequently takes him away from home. He is a helicopter pilot in the Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry Regiment."If Harry can stay in London for a while then he has a good chance of being back on with Chelsy, but she doesn't like it when he has to go away for months on end," the source told UsMagazine.com. "It's easier to be apart than together and pining for someone you can't see."

| License Photo	RALEIGH, N.C., May 26 (UPI) -- Households with dogs are home to more types of bacteria, including varieties rarely found in households without dogs, U.S. researchers say. Dr. Rob Dunn of North Carolina State University and colleagues at the University of Colorado said the team wanted to learn what variables influence the microbial ecosystems in homes, and the biggest variable it has found so far is dog ownership. "We can tell whether you own a dog based on the bacteria we find on your television screen or pillow case," Dunn said in a statement. "For example, there are bacteria normally found in soil that are 700 times more common in dog-owning households than in those without dogs."These microbial differences may be important. For example, it's known women who have a dog when pregnant are less likely to have children with allergies. While there's no known causal link between the presence of a dog and the absence of allergies, it has been hypothesized that the difference is related to the women's exposure to a wider variety of microbes, said Dunn, the study's co-author. However, to this point there had been little data on what the differences in microbial populations might be. While this study doesn't demonstrate a causal link, it sheds more light on the subject, showing that dogs have a major influence on which microbes are found in people's homes.The study, published in Plos One, found 7,726 phylotypes, or kinds, of bacteria in homes and each of the locations sampled harbored its own unique collection of bacteria. For example, the types of bacteria found in refrigerators, on kitchen counters and on cutting boards tended to be similar because they were primarily linked to food, while the bacteria on doorknobs, pillow cases and toilet seats were also fairly similar and came from humans.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 6 (UPI) -- NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr. said Thursday he is not concerned with the possibility of having to replace R.J. Reynolds as the racing series' sponsor, chiefly because he has five years to think about it.With stock car racing's premier series on the verge of opening its 2003 season, R.J. Reynolds announced Wednesday that NASCAR should begin looking for a new sponsor to replace Winston, which has bankrolled the circuit since 1971.It is estimated that the cigarette manufacturer spends between $30 million and $60 million a year, including promotion of the series, advertising and the points fund.A sluggish economy resulted in a record fourth-quarter loss by RJR Nabisco. That, coupled with the recent tobacco settlement, led the Atlanta-based company to decide to conclude its highly successful NASCAR sponsorship at the end of the current contract."There are some things they can't do, and with our audience getting younger, there are some things they can't do by law, like advertise on TV and radio," France said Thursday as media members began to gather for the activities leading up to the Daytona 500. "As our audience gets younger, they aren't supposed to be advertising to minors."I'm not going to get into other companies (to sponsor NASCAR). It's not the right time. If we land on something, you all will be among the first to know. We have five years to do it and who knows after that. We're not concerned about it.""I think what their release said yesterday is they have initiated conversations with us to see if it made sense for the sport and the entire industry to explore other opportunities that would be in the best interest of all the parties," said George Pyne, NASCAR's chief operating officer.RJR has not been so much a series sponsor as it has been a partner with NASCAR, helping fuel its rapid growth from a backwoods "hillbilly" sport to the second-most watched professional sports series in the United States.Now NASCAR must begin finding a new company willing to plunk down the millions of dollars it will cost to become the series sponsor."Certainly, over the years, we have been approached by people saying, `If that ever becomes available, we'd like to talk to you about it,'" Pyne said. "We've always said RJR was with NASCAR when it wasn't popular to be with NASCAR, and we're certainly going to reciprocate that spirit."Guys remember when tracks needed to be painted and track operators couldn't afford the paint, it was RJR that was there to help buy the paint and do scoreboards. They did a lot of things they didn't have to at a time when nobody else would do that. I would tell you that is a good way to do business. I think we have really appreciated that."The potential departure of RJR came as a shock to many of the drivers who have become rich from Winston's money."I think it does show a lot and says a lot about what NASCAR has done," said 1999 Winston Cup champion Dale Jarrett. "You've got to give R.J. Reynolds a lot of credit for helping since 1971. They have helped make this sport what it is today."We would move on if that were to happen. Obviously, it would be for the betterment of this sport probably dollar-wise because I would think that's what would make a change."Ironically, practically every Winston Cup driver is a non-smoker, although they all help promote the series sponsor and its cigarette brand."I'm not much into the politically correct thing," Jeff Burton said. "I figure that this is America and that's what makes it a great place to live. If you choose to smoke or whatever it is you choose to do, that's your choice."That's why we live where we live because we do have choices. Some people would say that this sport would be best served if we were sponsored by something other than a tobacco or an alcohol product."On the other hand, this is a great country that provides freedom and I think the opportunity for every company to have a chance to have their product on a national stage is part of what makes our country work."

HOUSTON, Aug. 1 (UPI) -- Tea Party insurgent Ted Cruz's easy win over a well-known Texas politician for the GOP's U.S. Senate nomination is part of "a great awakening," Cruz said."We are witnessing a great awakening," Cruz told supporters at a Houston hotel victory celebration."Millions of Texans, millions of Americans, are rising up to reclaim our country, defend liberty and restore the Constitution," he said. "We are rising up to take our country back."Cruz, 41 -- a Cuban-American Harvard-trained lawyer who has argued cases before the Supreme Court but had never before run for office -- defeated Republican Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, 56 percent to 44 percent, with virtually all precincts reporting.Dewhurst was favored by the Republican Party establishment, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry.Both men sought Republican support for the Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, the most senior female GOP senator.No Democrat has won a statewide Texas vote since 1994.In his speech, Cruz praised God -- "To Him be the glory" -- and thanked a long list that included conservative radio and TV hosts Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, libertarian-leaning presidential hopeful and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, and his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Martin Luther King Jr. and even Dewhurst."I salute Mr. Dewhurst for his many years in the Air Force, in the CIA and as lieutenant governor," Cruz said.Dewhurst, 66, a wealthy rancher and powerful GOP figure who spent freely from his vast personal fortune, told glum supporters in a neighboring hotel, "We got beat up a little, but we never gave up."He said he was not accustomed to losing an election."We will never stop fighting for our beloved Texas," Dewhurst said.The Houston Chronicle said his voice cracked as he spoke."We will never stop fighting for our conservative principles," he said. "We will never stop fighting President Barack Obama and his liberal agenda."Dewhurst will continue as lieutenant governor.Cruz's win will go down as one of the Tea Party's biggest wins of the year, alongside that of Indiana state Treasurer Richard Mourdock's primary win over Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., in May, The Hill said.It also echoes Cuban-American Marco Rubio's Senate victory in 2010 over Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, The New York Times said.

Police confiscated 495 pounds of marijuana, which has an estimated street value of $2.4 million."What makes this lab unique is the structure that housed the laboratory, the sophistication of the equipment that was used, and clearly the volume that was being harvested," said Roy Rutland, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade Police Department.Police arrested Arsenio Guerra, 43, who was found hiding on the property. He was charged with marijuana trafficking.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (UPI) -- The oil industry said it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a lower-court decision opening the door to gasoline containing a higher amount of ethanol.The American Petroleum Institute said the federal appeals court in Washington was wrong when it blocked an earlier challenge on the grounds the challengers, including the API, engine manufacturers and food producers, did not have legal standing in the matter.The challenge was aimed at blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from authorizing the sale of so-called E15 gasoline, which is 15 percent ethanol, as part of the federal Renewable Fuels Standard. The current legal maximum for ethanol content is 10 percent.The API said in a written statement the EPA made its ruling too soon and. "Had EPA stayed within its statutory authority and followed proper procedures, it would have waited until ongoing E15 testing on engines and fuel systems was completed before allowing the use of E15." Bob Greco, API Group Director for Downstream and Industry Operations, said. "Then it would have discovered that E15 is not safe for millions of vehicles now on the road."Greco added the API was certain complete testing would show ethanol was harmful to cars not built specifically for E15 and said that fact alone justified junking the entire federal Renewable Fuel Standard.The ethanol industry fired back with a written statement claiming the E15 challenge was aimed more at preserving market share for the oil industry by pushing ethanol out of the gasoline supply."It is time to put fuel choice in the hands of consumers," said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Alternative Fuels Association. "As gas prices continue to rise day after day, it is clear that Americans deserve the choice of lower-cost, cleaner-burning, high-performing E15."

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, March 12 (UPI) -- A daycare worker faces trial in Amsterdam, Netherlands, for allegedly sexually abusing 67 young children, prosecutors said.Robert Mikelsons, 28, of Latvia, whose trial was to begin Monday, is also charged with producing and distributing child pornography.He was arrested after an investigation into child pornography in the United States linked a photo of a 2-year-old boy to Mikelsons, Radio Netherlands reported Monday.He has allegedly confessed to 83 abuse cases but isn't being prosecuted in the remainder of the cases because the parents didn't want to risk their children's identities revealed, authorities said.Strict measures were being taken to protect the identity of the children, officials said.The court was expected to consider a controversial ruling that will allow victims' parents to testify on behalf of their children. Dutch law states only victims themselves are entitled to make a statement in court but that is not possible because the children are so young, officials said.Mikelsons' partner, Richard van Olffen, and several other suspects arrested during the investigation into the alleged pornography ring also face charges, Radio Netherlands said.

Wiki
Martin Charles Scorsese (pronounced /skɔrˈsɛsi/; born November 17, 1942) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film historian. He is the founder of the World Cinema Foundation and a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema, and has won awards from the Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Directors Guild of America. Scorsese is president of The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation.
Scorsese's body of work addresses such themes as Italian American identity, Roman Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, machismo, modern crime and violence. Scorsese is hailed as one of the significant and influential American filmmakers of the modern era, directing landmark films such as Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas – all of which he collaborated on with actor and close friend Robert De Niro. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for The Departed.
Martin Scorsese was born in New York City. His father, Charles Scorsese (1913–1993), and mother, Catherine Scorsese (born Cappa; 1912–97), both worked in New York's Garment District. His father was a clothes presser and an actor, and his mother was a seamstress and an actress. His father's parents emigrated from Polizzi Generosa, in the province of Palermo, Sicily. Scorsese was raised in a devoutly Catholic environment. As a boy, he had asthma and couldn't play sports or do any activities with other kids and so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed passion for cinema. Enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, at least two films of the genre, Land of the Pharaohs and El Cid, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on Italian neorealism, and commented on how Bicycle Thieves alongside Paisà, Rome, Open City inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian genes. In his documentary, Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of Roberto Rossellini's Paisà which he first saw on television alongside his relatives, who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, made a significant impact on his life. He has also cited Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray as a major influence on his career. His initial desire to become a priest while attending Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx gave way to cinema, and, consequently, Scorsese enrolled in NYU's University College of Arts and Science, (now known as the College of Arts and Science), where he earned a B.A. in English in 1964. He went on to earn his M.F.A. from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in 1966, a year after the school was founded.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
