Right-to-die woman to fight on
Diane Pretty arriving at court
A terminally-ill woman has pledged to continue her court action to win the right to be helped to commit suicide.
Three High Court judges decided that motor neurone disease sufferer Diane Pretty's husband Brian could not assist her suicide without potentially facing criminal action and a 14-year prison term.
However, she will now take the case directly to the House of Lords.
Motor neurone disease is an incurable and progressive illness which is gradually taking away Mrs Pretty's ability to move and communicate with others.
She wants to commit suicide, but would need assistance to do so.
She claims her quality of life has become so low that denying her the opportunity to commit suicide is a breach of her human rights.
Diane and Brian Pretty
In the first case of its kind, Mrs Pretty challenged a refusal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, to rule out taking action against her husband if he helps her commit suicide.
However, on Thursday morning, the panel of three High Court judges, while saying they felt "desperately sorry" for the couple, ruled that no-one had the human right to "procure their own death".
Had the Director of Public Prosecutions agreed not to prosecute her husband, it would be a "licence to commit crime", they said.
Dignity
The right to human dignity enshrined in the new Act was not the right to die with dignity, they ruled - simply the right to enjoy as dignified a life as possible.
Lord Justice Tuckey, one of the three, said: "Even if we had good reason to think that the blanket ban on assisting
suicide were no longer thought necessary in the democratic society of England
and Wales, we would have no reason to think that to allow assisted suicide in
such circumstances would be generally acceptable."
Diane has said she wants to carry on. She's a very tough lady and always knows exactly what she wants
Deborah Annetts, Voluntary Euthanasia Society
Outside the court after the ruling, Mrs Pretty said that she was "angry and disappointed".
Fighting on
Deborah Annetts from the Voluntary Euthanasia Society told the BBC that there were good grounds for carrying on the fight. "Diane has said she wants to carry on. She's a very tough lady and always knows exactly what she wants.
I think it is a victory for common sense
Dr Michael Howitt-Wilson, Alert
"She wants to die with dignity, when and how she wants."
A spokesman for Liberty, the civil rights organisation, said: "We are very disappointed but we will look forward to taking the case to the House of Lords."
Mona Arshi, Diane Pretty's solicitor, told the BBC: "We will be arguing that this court just didn't get the law right."
However, the ruling was immediately welcomed by some campaigners.
Dr Greg Gardner, deputy chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance said: "What we were looking at was not the autonomy of one person to have assisted suicide, but the freedom of the majority to be protected from value judgements about the quality of life."
Dr Michael Howitt-Wilson, deputy chairman of pressure group Alert, said: "I think it is a victory for common sense."
The judges said that their decision was "inescapable", and refused her leave to make an appeal.
However, she can take the case directly to the Law Lords.
Disease advanced
During the two day hearing last week Philip Havers QC, representing Ms Pretty, told the three judges that her disease was at an advanced stage.
She very strongly wishes to control when and where she dies
Philip Havers QC, for Diane Pretty
He told the court: "She is frightened and distressed at the suffering and indignity which she will have to endure before she dies if the disease is allowed to run its course.
"She very strongly wishes to control when and where she dies."
After the case, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was sympathetic to Mrs Pretty's circumstances, but welcomed the ruling.
"The Director of Public Prosecutions cannot licence people to commit crimes," a spokesman said.

Landmark meeting for gay Lebanese
By Kim Ghattas
BBC News, Beirut
For people routinely harassed and sometimes arrested by the Lebanese authorities, it was refreshing to be able to attend a public event without fear of being detained. But the gun-toting policemen standing outside the hotel were not there to carry out a raid against the dozens of people who had gathered inside for the press conference by the gay rights organisation, Helem. Lebanon is seeing its first stirrings of gay pride
Instead, the police were there to ensure the safety of the event. The press conference part of a three-day event organised by Helem to coincide with International Day Against Homophobia, which marks the day in May 1990 on which the World Health Organisation took homosexuality off its list of mental disorders. 'Dream'
These are changing times in Lebanon too, according to George Azzi, the co-ordinator for Helem, which is the Arabic acronym for Lebanese Protection for Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders. Helem also means dream in Arabic. In Lebanon, they're still trying to 'cure' homosexuality, so this event is a way for us to explain what homosexuality is
George Azzi
It's the first such organisation in the Arab world. "In Lebanon, they're still trying to 'cure' homosexuality, so this event is a way for us to explain what homosexuality is.
"But things have been changing, especially in Beirut, gays are more accepted and Helem is becoming much more visible," said Mr Azzi. It's only the second year that Helem has organised a public event - the first year very few people attended. Courage
The organisation is considered legal because the government did not respond negatively to their request for registration within three months of applying.
"Basically, they did not know what do with us so they didn't respond, therefore we're legal," Mr Azzi said. "It was very hard for us at the beginning, but we got a lot of support after a while, today we work with a lot of other NGOs who wouldn't work with us at first and we opened our community centre a year ago."
Patriarchal Arab societies don't accept that women have sexual desires, so for a woman to say not only that she is sexually active but that she doesn't need a man... that's quite shocking
Reina Sarkis, psychoanalyst
It took a lot of courage for gays and lesbian people to attend the event as it made their sexual orientation public in a country where homosexuality is still considered illegal. Most of those attending the event did not want to have their picture taken. Under article 534 of the penal code, "unnatural sexual intercourse" is punishable by the law and this article is used to harass homosexual people. Though no-one has been convicted recently under the article, Helem's main goal is to have it removed it from the law. The organisation says the article also makes homosexual people feel vulnerable and stops them from seeking help from the police for ordinary matters like thefts. Informal political support
"This event is very good for us, it shows that we exist and that we're not some strange underground community," said Oliver, one of those attending. "I'm not afraid but a lot of people are still afraid to show they are gay."
Nada, a young woman at the conference said it was easier for women to hide their bisexuality or homosexuality. "Women can even still get married and have children. But it's harder for men, especially if they're feminine, and our societies are more used to see women touch and hold hands and be affectionate," said Nada. But Reina Sarkis, a psychoanalyst who works with Helem, also said that lesbians were accepted as long as they did not make their sexual orientation known. "Patriarchal Arab societies don't accept that women have sexual desires, so for a woman to say not only that she is sexually active but that she doesn't need a man because she's having sex with a woman, that's quite shocking."
The organisation was getting support from a number of politicians but only informally because religion is still very powerful in Lebanon and politics ruled by sectarianism, Mr Azzi says.
"So what we also support in Lebanon is secularism in politics and everyday life. If secularism becomes the trend in Lebanon then gay rights will come next."

Everton wrap up Neville signing
This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make
Phil Neville's career statistics
Everton have completed the signing of Phil Neville from Manchester United.
The 28-year-old has signed a five-year deal at Goodison Park after the two clubs agreed a fee in excess of �3m.
"We are delighted to have concluded a deal with a player of Phil's calibre and vast experience," Toffees boss David Moyes told the club's website.
"Primarily I see him as a holding midfield player but he gives us much-needed cover and also several additional options."
Neville will be available for Everton's Champions League third-round qualifier against Villarreal on Tuesday.
Moyes has endured a summer of mounting frustration in the transfer market and was relieved to seal the deal for Neville.
"We have staved off a great deal of competition to get him," he said.
He'll be a good influence
From MS
Have your say on 606
"Several clubs were interested in signing him but I must say from the first minute I spoke to him he only wanted to come to Everton."
Neville made 386 appearances during his 18-year United career and won 52 England caps.
However, after starting only 12 games last season, the utility player felt the time was right to leave.
"This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make," he told Manchester United's website.
"But I am excited about joining Everton and relishing my next challenge in football.
This was not a decision we wanted to make
Sir Alex Ferguson
"This was a mutual decision between myself and the manager (Sir Alex Ferguson).
"I've spent 18 years of my life at the club and I would like to thank Sir Alex, all the players and the fans for their great support.
"I am now going to give the same commitment to Everton, David Moyes and the Everton fans. I can't wait for the new season to get started."
United manager Ferguson said: "This was not a decision we wanted to make, but every time I picked the team and Phil's name was not on the teamsheet, it was very difficult for me.
"You couldn't meet a better professional and he leaves with the gratitude of everyone at the the club for his service to United.
"I wish all the best to Phil and his family."
