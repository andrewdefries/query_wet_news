Diamond heist baffles police
Antwerp: At the centre of the diamond trade for 400 years Belgian police are trying to unravel events behind a daring robbery in the diamond-cutting capital of the world.
Thieves cleared out 123 of the 160 vaults in the maximum security cellars at Antwerp's Diamond Centre at the weekend, but the raid was only discovered the next day.
The precise value of the stolen diamonds is not known, but Belgian media have speculated it could run to millions of dollars.
Diamond traders in the city have been shocked by the audacity of the robbery and fear it could be a blow to their industry.
Inside job?
The Diamond Centre building, located in the heart of Antwerp's historic diamond district, is closely guarded.
There are surveillance camers, entry codes, 24-hour security guards, and even cameras in the vaults.
But with no signs of a break-in, police suspect the thieves could have had inside help and have been questioning staff and owners of the safes at the centre.
Antwerp's Diamond High Council, which represents the gemstone traders, has admitted the robbery could have serious implications for an industry proud of its discretion and security.
"Diamond traders aren't saying it openly, but it's clear they think one of their colleagues was perhaps implicated in the plot," the council's spokesman, Youri Steverlynck, said.
The diamonds in the vaults belonged to about 70 individuals or organisations, the Antwerp prosecutor's office believes.
Diamonds are big business in Antwerp. Last years it handled about $26bn in traded diamonds, processing some 80% of the world's production of uncut gems.

Fishermen protest over fuel costs
Fishermen in Newlyn claim fuel costs have doubled in 12 months
Fishermen from Cornwall and Devon have travelled to London to protest at the "crucifying" effect high fuel prices are having on the industry.
A group from the fishing port of Newlyn in Cornwall set off in the early hours.
Fishermen there claim the cost of diesel has doubled, eating away at profits. They say the situation is "beyond critical".
Fishing boats use red diesel, which has risen from around 30p a litre to 60p a litre in the last 12 months.
Sam Lambourne, who fishes out of Newlyn, said fuel costs used to represent 20% to 25% of the gross value of the catch, but now represent 65% to 70% of the gross value. The price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment
Tom McClure, Skipper
Fishermen said they were unable to raise the price of fish to cover the rising fuel costs because what they catch is sold at auction.
Tom McClure, skipper of the trawler Harvest Reaper, said: "The price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment. It's not just the initial running costs, fuel prices are so high they are eating into profits, which is eating into the maintenance of the boat.
"A boat is a tool for earning money, you've got to maintain that tool."
Elizabeth Stevenson, president of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: "We are looking for some sort of aid which will allow businesses to get back on their feet, to put together a plan of how to change their fishing patterns, to make them profitable or even break even."
The fishermen from Newlyn joined others from around the UK and some from France, in the demonstration outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London.
The protest was timed to coincide with a meeting between fishing industry
leaders and the fisheries minister Jonathan Shaw to discuss the issue.
Last month a similar protest at fuel prices was held by lorry drivers.

Tuition fees reintroduction call
Lord Sutherland was also formerly principal of Edinburgh University
Tuition fees should be reintroduced in Scotland, the former head of Universities Scotland has said.Lord Sutherland said some of the money should go to scholarships to pay for students from poor backgrounds who cannot afford fees and living costs. Up-front tuition fees were abolished in Scotland in 2000, two years after their introduction by the Blair government. A student union said tuition fees were rejected by consensus and top-up fees in England had not increased access. Tuition fees were introduced in 1998, by Tony Blair's Labour government. However, in 2000, the Labour and Lib Dem coalition in Scotland abolished up-front fees north of the border, following the Cubie inquiry into student finance. While top-up fees of up to £3,000 were introduced in England and Wales in 2006, the following year the SNP administration abolished the fees altogether.
I think offering scholarships is very important because the cost of going to university - fees and living costs - are high
Lord Sutherland
However, according to the latest statistics from Higher Education Statistics Agency, Scotland had fewer university students from disadvantaged backgrounds than any other part of the UK. A total of 26% of students in Scotland come from poorer backgrounds, compared with 40% in Northern Ireland and 30% across the UK as a whole. Lord Sutherland, who was also formerly a principal of Edinburgh University, told BBC Scotland: "People who are intellectually talented come from all corners of society and they're the ones who should be going to university, and we should help. "I think offering scholarships is very important because the cost of going to university - fees and living costs - are high. "One way of doing this would be to make sure that those who can afford it do pay tuition fees and ensure that a percentage of that goes to the scholarship for those who can't afford it." BBC Scotland's education correspondent Seonag MacKinnon said a lot of senior university figures privately believe the current situation advantages middle-class students who dominate Scottish universities. She said the public purse in Scotland had so far matched what has gone into universities south of the border from top-up fees.
The Scottish Government has restored the principal of free education in Scotland
Scottish Government spokesman
But the correspondent added that public spending cuts were expected in Scotland and there was a feeling that funding at that level was not sustainable, given the widespread expectation that fees south of the border were set to rise to about £5,000 after the General Election. However, Liam Burns, from the National Union of Students in Scotland, said when fees were in place in Scotland, a consensus had been reached that parliament and universities did not want the system. And Tony Axon, spokesman for the University and College Union Scotland, said. "No political party or any current head of a university is calling for such fees. "His attempt to legitimise the reintroduction of fees by calling for increased bursaries for students from poorer backgrounds reveals that he has clearly not properly investigated the failing system south of the border." A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: "We believe that access to education should be based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay and have made clear that we are opposed to tuition fees in Scotland. "The Scottish Government has restored the principal of free education in Scotland, abolishing the graduate endowment fee benefitting up to 50,000 students and graduates."

O'Sullivan and Maguire shake hands after a compelling match
Stephen Maguire edged Ronnie O'Sullivan out of the Masters with a thrilling 6-5 first-round win after an astonishing last-gasp reprieve at Wembley Arena.
In the deciding frame, O'Sullivan missed a key blue with the rest to let the Scot steal it at the death.
The enthralling match saw Maguire open up a 3-1 lead at the interval with breaks of 103 and 84.
O'Sullivan, who beat Maguire 10-2 in the UK Championship final, levelled at 5-5 before the dramatic finale.
The match pitted provisional world number one O'Sullivan against the provisional world number two, and it lived up to expectations with some nail-biting moments and high-quality shots.
I had my chance and I didn't take it
Ronnie O'Sullivan
Maguire made a strong start, and a miraculous escape from a horrible snooker helped him to take the opener before O'Sullivan levelled with a 68 in the next.
Breaks of 103 and 84 took Maguire 3-1 ahead, and he went further clear by winning the scrappy fifth frame but he seemed less assured after the break.
O'Sullivan showed his class with runs of 103 and 72 before Maguire stopped the rot with another frame. More pressure came Maguire's way as the defending champion made runs of 66 and 64 to force a decider, but O'Sullivan failed to make a winning position count with the crucial missed blue.
606: DEBATE
What a performance from Stephen "on fire" Maguire!
STH
O'Sullivan was philosophical about the result, saying he would quickly forget about the match.
"I had my chance and I didn't take it," said O'Sullivan.
"If you don't take your chances then don't expect another one.
"You just have to put these results behind you. In 10 years' time will this match have much significance in what I've done in my career? I don't think so."
Maguire said he had resigned himself to defeat in the final frame.
I was actually thinking 'what am I going to do tonight now that I'm out?'
Stephen Maguire
"At 4-1 up I was feeling brilliant and I felt as though I didn't fancy missing if I split the pack, I was confident I could clear up at one visit," he said.
"But he's made a 100 break to come back to 4-2 and I was thinking 'what have I got to do to beat this guy?'
"I was never in doubt he was going to clear up. I was 100% sure he was going to clear up.
"I was actually thinking 'what am I going to do tonight now that I'm out?'"
Earlier, former world champion Shaun Murphy shrugged off a slow start to seal a 6-3 win over Ali Carter in the opening match of the tournament.
Carter took the opening two frames before a break of 66 in the third got Murphy into the swing of things.
Murphy was not at his best in the opening match
Murphy levelled the scoreline, but a 77 edged Carter back in front.
But with neither player finding top gear, Murphy proved better at grinding out the remaining frames as Carter's frustration got the better of him.
Murphy admitted he had not hit his best form, but said he had been short of practice time because of illness.
"I'm very pleased about my game considering I had not practised over Christmas because I was ill," said Murphy.
"I was going to the toilet every 20 minutes. I'm still not well and Ali was poorly during the match too."
In the final match of the day, Wales' Ryan Day provided the quality in a low-key wildcard round victory over a misfiring Barry Hawkins.
Day raced into a 3-0 lead as Hawkins spurned a series of opportunities, although the Englishman did pull one frame back before the interval.
The fifth frame saw Day in with a chance of a 147 maximum break, but he broke down on 113.
Hawkins took a scrappy sixth, but that was as good as it got as Day made breaks of 55 and 120 to seal a 6-2 win.
