Algerians find no cause for celebration
Algerians have lost faith in their politicians
By Mohamed Arezki Himeur BBC, Algiers
Musicians in traditional dress may have been criss-crossing the streets of Algiers for several days, but they have failed to create a festive atmosphere on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Algeria's independence from France, after a bloody, seven-year war. The authorities have splashed out on celebrations, with concerts by rai stars such as Khaled, Cheb Mami and Rachid Taha, and a show called Watani, meaning My Nation, on the eve of the big day. So far, independence has not brought us anything
Fateh, 22, unemployed
In fact, no efforts have been spared to give the impression that the dreary life of the Algerians is rosy. But that image could not be further from the bitter reality. Violence upsurge
Islamic militants, who were thought to have been defeated, are back in force. They were flushed out of Algiers in 1998, but they signalled their return with a series of bloody attacks in the heart of the capital and in the suburbs. The radical Islamists took up arms after the army cancelled the country's first pluralist elections in 1991 which an Islamist party - the Islamic Salvation Front - was poised to win.
It is back to square one for Algeria.
As many as 170,000 people are believed to have died in the violence The militants have taken advantage of the national concord law decreed three years ago by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to regroup, with new fighters recruited among the unemployed and those left behind by the economic liberalisation process.
Fateh, 22, sits on an old plastic crate, behind the piece of cardboard that he uses as a stand to display cigarettes he sells by the unit. He gazes at the musicians walking down the main boulevard, Rue Mourad Didouche. Unemployment
"So far, independence has not brought us anything, my family and myself," he says. "There are nine of us living in two rooms like sardines. My father has lost the job he had for about 20 years in a company which has gone bust. Overnight, he found himself without an income."
Many in Algiers are struggling to make ends meet Like Fateh, his two brothers are in what they call "bizness", the illegal sale of local or imported goods. "We don't have any choice. We have to earn a little money not to die of hunger," he says. For years, Fateh has had something on his mind: he wants to leave the country, but to go where? "Anywhere in Europe, to work and save some money, and then come back here to have my own shop, buy a flat and start a family." Exile
Thousands of young Algerians have left the country illegally to flee unemployment, violence and the lack of prospects. Many of those who stay break down, take to the bottle or to drugs. Rioting has been widespread in the Kabylie region Suicide - by hanging, usually - has been on the increase for the last couple of years, especially in rural areas. Poverty is spreading, and prostitution is rife. Forty years after independence, Algeria is facing an identity crisis and severe political, economic and social problems. The gap between ordinary people and their leaders is widening. Protest
They only have one weapon, rioting, to protest against what they call hogra, the authorities' scorn for them, water shortages and what they consider as the unfair allocation of social housing. Young people in Algiers say that political parties are past their sell-by date. They say that the return in the political arena of the former single party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), after the parliamentary election in May, does not bode well. Bouteflika is challenged by fundamentalists and Berbers The old guard of the FLN, which ruled the country for 25 years after independence, could be tempted to restore the single-party system, thus threatening the democratic freedoms gained from the bloody 1988 riots. With such a volatile situation, with the attacks blamed on the Islamic militants and the haphazard political and economic leadership in the background, foreign companies are not rushing to invest in Algeria. Meanwhile, state companies unable to compete with imports are closing down in quick succession. Economic liberalisation has made nearly 500,000 people jobless over the last few years. The unemployed, their families and those who spend their days idle, with their back to a wall, could not care less about the celebrations for Independence Day.

Q&A: Crunch trade talks
The talks have been going on for seven years
Finding a happy ending to marathon global trade talks was never going to be easy, as 153 countries tried to thrash out a deal in the face of global economic uncertainty.
And according to the World Trade Organization, efforts to liberalise global trade have "collapsed" without agreement.
How long had the talks been going on?
The world has been trying to reach a new deal to expand free trade since the Doha Development Agenda was launched with great fanfare in the Qatari capital in November 2001.
But progress has been very slow and little progress has been made after almost seven years of seemingly fruitless haggling.
Discussions have foundered over the extent of cuts to farm subsidies and how far trade in services such as banking and telecoms should be liberalised.
In the latest round of talks that collapsed on Wednesday, negotiators from more than 30 countries had hoped to inject fresh impetus into the process.
Why have the talks failed?
There seems little doubt the talks have collapsed - with officials saying that China, India and the US failing to agree on import rules was behind the stalemate.
The main stumbling block was farm import rules, which allow countries to protect poor farmers by imposing a tariff on certain goods in the event of a drop in prices or a surge in imports. India, China and the US could not agree on the tariff threshold for such an event. Washington said that the "safeguard clause" protecting developing nations from unrestricted imports had been set too low. How will this affect world trade?
There will be no immediate impact on global trade flows given that the measures under discussion typically had implementation periods of up to 14 years.
African countries have limited access to world markets
However, the failure does undermine the credibility of the multilateral trading system and will most likely lead to greater reliance on regional and bilateral trade agreements. These are politically easier to negotiate but often put smaller and poorer countries at a disadvantage.
The failure to revive the talks also raises doubts about the ability of the international community to tackle other global issues such as climate change and soaring food and energy prices.
What does this mean for developing countries?
Some non-government organisations (NGOs) say that no deal is better outcome than a bad deal for the world's poorest countries.
Africa, the poorest continent on the planet, was not even represented in the inner circle of talks by the end. However, a fair trade deal could have given poorer countries a chance to become less reliant on aid and to prevent worsening poverty.
Does this mean the Doha round is doomed?
With the failure of the talks, the next step for the Doha Round is not yet clear. Global trade talks are likely to be put on back burner for the time being, especially with US elections in November. "We will need to let the dust settle a bit," WTO chief Pascal Lamy said.
"It's probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point. WTO Members will need to have a sober look at if and how they bring the pieces back together."

Franklin 'responds to treatment'
Aretha Franklin is best known for her signature song Respect
Soul legend Aretha Franklin remains in hospital after having an allergic reaction to antibiotics, the singer's doctor has said.
She was admitted to Detroit's Sinai-Grace Hospital after returning from a concert tour on Saturday, Dr Claud Young told television station WXYZ-TV.
He said she had suffered a "rather
severe" reaction to antibiotics.
"I am resting comfortably and responding very well," Franklin said in a statement released by her publicist.
Franklin is one of the world's most revered singers, best known for her signature song Respect.
The legendary singer turns 62 on Thursday and last month won a Grammy award for her song Wonderful from her latest album So Damn Happy. Other hits the singer has had in her long career include Chain of Fools, (You Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman and Freeway of Love.
She has been cited as one of the most influential singers in modern times.
Last year Franklin led a vigil for her friend, the soul singer Luther Vandross, who was in a coma after suffering a stroke.

Sky launches 'freesat' digital TV
Sky's subscription figures have been slowing
BSkyB has launched a free digital satellite TV service which offers 140 channels for a one-off fee of �150.
The service, freesat from Sky, is being seen by many as an attempt to rival the success of Freeview, the equivalent service for digital terrestrial TV.
It has been launched with little fanfare by Sky, as the company continues to focus on pay-TV.
Viewers will get a digital set-top box, satellite dish, with free installation and a remote control in the deal.
The service will initially be only available directly from BSkyB.
The company hopes that the absence of a subscription fee will lure new customers who may eventually switch to a pay-TV package when analogue TV is phased out.
SKY'S FREE-TO-AIR PACKAGE
140 TV channels
80 radio channels
13 interactive services
All BBC digital services
All other terrestrial channels
Others include BBC regional channels on BBC One and Two
What Sky's free digital deal means
A spokesman for BSkyB said: "We think it is a really good offer for customers.
"It is not our core business. We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on the promotion of our pay-TV services."
Freeview has attracted nearly 4 million users since its launch in 2002 and has helped drive take up of digital television.
BSkyB says it does not see Freeview as a threat but will have been un-nerved by the recent slowdown in the numbers of subscribers to its pay-TV services.
Viewers can also buy a Sky Plus box - which contains a hard disc-based video recorder - without the need for a subscription to programme packages.
BSkyB charges �199 for the more advanced box, a further �120 for installation and �10 a month for subscription to Sky Plus.

The road to Bethlehem
Diary
Map
Why do it?
Aleem Maqbool walked from Nazareth to Bethlehem, retracing a journey made by Joseph and Mary in the New Testament story of Jesus' birth.
Part three of his diary began in al-Bireh, near Ramallah, and took him through Jerusalem to Bethlehem in time for Christmas.
Read part one of the diary
Read part two of his diary
AFTERNOON , 25 DECEMBER: JOURNEY'S END
"You know this walk is going to change you, don't you?" Father Louis, the parish priest in Nazareth had said, before I set off.
"It won't be just a physical journey that you take, but a spiritual one too." I smiled, politely, but did not believe him. Aleem Maqbool reflects on the complex region he has journeyed through
Maybe it is just my exhaustion, and maybe it will seem ridiculous and romantic in a few days time, but now, at the end of the trek, I do feel uplifted by the last 10 days.
If you want to call that "spiritual", then perhaps Father Louis was right.
I certainly feel I have learned a great deal from the people I have met and stayed with along the way from Nazareth. And not just about the conflict or religion.
Some conversations will linger for a while.
Those with Nedal, my guide through the hills of the northern West Bank, and the nearest thing to an "Ent" from Tolkien's Middle-Earth as I was ever likely to meet in person.
He talked of the flora and fauna as if they were family.
Chatting with the 1970s wrestling champion, Hazem, in the bath-house in Nablus, and hearing his disappointment that young people were losing interest in "noble" sporting pursuits like his.
And then there was the young Israeli soldier at a West Bank checkpoint, who talked of a love of football, and defended me when his colleagues said they really could not understand why I couldn't just get in a car and drive the rest of the way to Bethlehem.
Much of the trip was a reminder that, however obvious this sounds, people in a conflict zone are as three-dimensional as those anywhere else.
There were, of course, sad indications of the tensions here.
There was the silence of hundreds of people as they buried a 22-year-old militant in the village of Yamoon, after an Israeli army raid.
A sense of how far apart the worlds of Jewish settlers and Palestinian villagers were, how little interaction there was between the two and how entrenched their views are.
And then there was the military checkpoint that greets visitors entering Bethlehem.
But people along the way did speak of hope - though not necessarily expectation - that things would get better one day.
I want to say a quick word about the donkeys. All five are now back with, and being cared for by, their respective owners.
At the risk of upsetting the others (though I have a feeling they won't care), number three remains a firm favourite - a loyal and worthy travelling companion, with whom I shared walks through some of the finest landscapes of the trail.
Almost at the moment it turned Christmas Day in Bethlehem, it began to rain.
The initial recitations of the Latin Patriarch, in the Church of the Nativity, fought with the bad weather, and won - to be heard outside, in Manger Square.
But the Patriarch's traditional Christmas message, of peace and goodwill, has a much tougher battle to fight.
Even as midnight mass was being conducted, there was news of more conflict elsewhere in the region.
But throughout history, change in this part of the world has often come unexpectedly and in dramatic fashion.
According to the Bible, a journey here made by a man, a heavily-pregnant woman and a donkey changed the world in an instant.
Around two millennia on, their story still impacts on the lives of hundreds of millions of people.
AFTERNOON , 24 DECEMBER: INTO BETHLEHEM
The final day of our trek began in the peaceful surroundings of Shepherds' Fields, close to the caves it is thought the shepherds used for shelter.
But the closer we got to what is the focal point of Christmas celebrations around the world, the higher the noise levels and the more feverish the atmosphere around us became.
Bands were marching outside Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity
More than anything else, climbing the last cobbled street into the centre of Bethlehem was a moment of considerable relief.
Sada (donkey number five) and I squeezed past boy scout marching bands and bagpipers. The plaza in front of the Church of the Nativity opened up to our left, with Manger Square to our right.
We were a matter of metres away from the spot where, after Mary and Joseph's long journey, it is believed their baby Jesus was laid in a manger.
Hundreds of pilgrims have been pouring here in recent hours ahead of midnight mass - the climax of proceedings here and the moment when I will consider my journey complete.
EVENING , 23 DECEMBER: BEIT SAHOUR
"Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them and they were greatly afraid."
I am in the village of Beit Sahour (where the above episode from Luke's Gospel is thought to have happened), just a short walk from Manger Square in Bethlehem.
Excited as I am about nearly reaching the journey's goal, tiredness has been the overriding emotion today.
Thousands of pilgrims descend on Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity
And as I traipsed the tough Jerusalem stone pavements that jarred my bones, I tried to conjure up the feeling of walking through those olive groves just a few days ago. As I stood in a long queue to get through the turnstiles of the final Israeli checkpoint into Bethlehem, I scrolled through photos on my camera, of beautiful hills and hamlets, taken during the trek.
This, the main entry point into Bethlehem on foot, felt a world away. It meant walking past Israeli soldiers, through a door-shaped gap in a long section of high, grey, concrete wall. This is part of the barrier Israel has been building in recent years, it says to keep out suicide bombers and attackers. Palestinians see it as a means by which Israel can grab more land.
People in Bethlehem often talk of feeling suffocated, by a barrier that encircles parts of the town, and encroaches well inside its territory, and by the Jewish settlements that are being built on occupied Palestinian lands close by.
Late in the evening, I wound my way down to a field in Beit Sahour where not one, but a dozen donkeys were waiting for me. Actually, I was visiting a travelling clinic run by the only donkey sanctuary in the region. Villagers had brought their animals to be checked by an expert.
In Manger Square preparations are underway for Christmas Simon Lowe, from Safe Haven for Donkeys in the Holy Land, talked of horrific cases of abuse he had come across in his time here (animals being beaten, or set alight or, more usually, just abandoned). But his sanctuary takes in such cases and keeps them for the rest of their lives.
Never in my life did I think I would be saying this, but I had missed having a donkey to walk with today. Dour, they may be, but their natural humility, mixed with the occasional spirited bout of stubbornness (usually, I thought, brought on with good reason), I found to be pretty admirable. Number five is ready to accompany me on the final leg tomorrow morning.
MORNING , 23 DECEMBER: JERUSALEM

Aleem Maqbool reaches Jerusalem
Al-Bireh, just north of Ramallah, where I sipped my Turkish coffee, is where it is believed there was a caravan stop at the time of Mary and Joseph's nativity journey.
It is also thought to be where, on a trip 12 years later, according to the Bible, the couple realised they had accidentally left Jesus behind in Jerusalem.
The ruins of a Byzantine church stand there now, littered with plastic bottles and old newspapers. Beside the site is a mosque.
Luke's Gospel describes the spot as being "a day's journey" from Jerusalem, which was to be my next stop.
Many Palestinians here, outwardly at least, seem determined not to concern themselves even with the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip
I headed south, with my elderly donkey, through territory I knew well. Ramallah is the city in which I have lived for more than a year-and-a-half.
Amid all the chaos and conflict in other parts of the Palestinian Territories, Ramallah tries hard to cocoon itself.
Three Palestinian refugee camps are incorporated into the city; Jewish settlements expand on the hills around it; access to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or parts of the northern West Bank has become difficult - yet the building work on new apartment blocks all over Ramallah points to the beginnings of economic progress.
Socially too, the city has tried to remain resilient.
An evening out in any number of fancy restaurants or bars hypnotises the wealthiest of Ramallah's residents into thinking that all is well in the world.
Many Palestinians here, outwardly at least, seem determined not to concern themselves even with the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, for example.
Underneath, most acknowledge that Ramallah's future is still incredibly fragile.
A large, new piece of graffiti is visible on the familiar grey wall near the Kalandia checkpoint
Approaching the Kalandia checkpoint, through which I needed to pass continue my journey, I noticed a large, new piece of graffiti on the familiar grey.
"ROMANTIK/POETIK," it said - the artist having started on the Israeli watchtower and continuing on to the high concrete wall that separates Ramallah from Jerusalem here.
I had to say goodbye to donkey number four.
We had been told by the Israeli authorities that we would need a licence for her if we were to film her in Jerusalem, which would take at least 30 days to come through.
I was not so sorry - well-behaved as she was, the donkey was far too slow. I would look to get a new one near Bethlehem.
I negotiated the queues, turnstiles and x-ray machines with few hold-ups, and headed through the crossing towards the centre of Jerusalem.
I was turned back at a subsequent, smaller, checkpoint, but it was a minor inconvenience as I knew a route around it.
The Old City of Jerusalem has welcomed pilgrims for centuries
Mary and Joseph's nativity trail then took a small detour via my favourite hummus restaurant in the suburb of Beit Hanina.
But it was not too much later that I found myself at the gates of Jerusalem's Old City, that had welcomed pilgrims for centuries.
The narrow, stone streets of the ancient Christian Quarter (where I would spend the night), were decorated with coloured lights. It was impossible to stop smiling, in spite of the tiredness.
This morning, Santa Claus visited the Old City - he was even handing out free Christmas trees.
In fact, it was Issa, a well-known former basketball player, himself from the Old City, doing a good deed on behalf of the Jerusalem Municipality.
"Peace to all mankind!" he said cheerfully while helping people select a fir that best suited them.
MORNING , 22 DECEMBER: AL-BIREH
"If people think my views are extreme, then fine, I'm an extremist," said Batya Medad. "I have no problem with that."
Batya lives in the Jewish settlement of Shilo, in the middle of the "West Bank" (though Batya does not use that term, instead calling it by the Biblical regions it covers, Judea and Samaria).
Every country around the world, except for Israel, considers settlements like Batya's illegal, built on occupied Palestinian land. When I put that to her, she responded angrily.
"We (Jews) are the only ones with history here, we were here first and we should be here now. It's totally immoral to say we can't be," she says.
Batya says she instantly felt at home when she moved from New York to Shilo
"I don't care what the world thinks. They didn't care when the Nazis started against the Jews and when Jews were murdered. So why should I care?"
Batya and her husband, Yisrael, were both born and raised in New York, but moved in 1970. She says she never had a feeling of belonging when she was in the United States, but that when she moved here, she instantly felt at home.
Israeli and Palestinian politicians, supported by the international community, are meant to be working towards an end to the Israeli occupation here and the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
However, Batya says she thinks that the peace process will go nowhere, and that her future in Shilo is not under threat at all.
From Shilo, I continued south along a route through a valley it is believed Mary and Joseph, and indeed many prophets (including Abraham) before them, may have travelled.
Even in the past few decades, this landscape has changed considerably.
Like many other Jewish settlements, Shilo occupies a hilltop
On many of the hilltops were the gleaming, red-roofed homes of Jewish settlements. Down below them, the more haphazard, organic-looking, Palestinian villages. There is almost no interaction between the two sets of communities, only tension.
It was an uncomfortable walk, as I received suspicious looks from both settlers and Palestinians.
The settlers I passed, one or two of them armed, seemed to assume I was Palestinian, and so, perhaps, a potential attacker. "Assalamo alaikum," one settler said as he approached me, in what I felt was a test. I decided a "hi" might be better than the traditional Muslim reply in these circumstances. He relaxed and walked away.
The Palestinians, who heard me speaking English on my phone, seemed to assume I was an immigrant settler. "Mustoutan, mustoutan" ("settler, settler"), I heard a young boy shout as he ran into his house after clocking me.
I decided to quicken my pace and walk close to the main road.
Donkey number four was waiting for me further down the trail. She was white from head to tail, except for a dark, rough patch on her right flank - I asked her owner what it was.
Meet the donkeys who have accompanied Aleem on his journey
In pictures He told me that the donkey came from the Kalandia Refugee Camp, close to Ramallah. A few years ago, he said, when there were frequent clashes between young people from the camp and Israeli soldiers, the donkey had brushed against a pile of burning tyres which set her hair alight. He said there had thankfully been no lasting damage.
The donkey seemed to be very well-behaved. It was only once I starting walking with my new companion that I realised that we did have a problem - she was extraordinarily slow. We called the owner again, who explained that she was now in her mid-twenties, so there was nothing we could do about her speed. I persevered.
By evening, I eventually reached the village of Bir Zeit where I was to stay with the Christian Kassis family (roughly half of the village is Muslim, the other half Christian).
Over the traditional Palestinian dish of Maklouba (which means "upside-down" and is wonderful mix of rice, meat and yoghurt), I spoke to Mrs Kassis and the older of her two sons (the other was out with university friends).
I was told that the family's former house, and the land around it had been confiscated by the Israeli army as it was next to the checkpoint to the north of the village (which I had entered earlier). There had been no compensation, they said.
Earlier this year, the younger son had been arrested by the army in a 3am raid on the house. His brother told me that he had been held without charge (something the Israeli authorities call "administrative detention") for six months before being released.
If it looks like we might miss Christmas in Bethlehem because of the donkey's slow pace, I will have to trade her in for a younger animal
While we were eating, there was a knock at the door. Mrs Kassis answered and then came back into the kitchen, beaming, with a piece of paper in her hand.
"It's my permit from Israel to travel to Jerusalem for Christmas," she said proudly. Her son was not so impressed.
"It's sad that we get excited about these little things while everything else is going wrong," he said.
I spent the night at the Kassis home and have made my way south to al-Bireh. I write this report from a coffee shop there, full of old men (some wearing the traditional Palestinian headscarf) playing cards and drinking tea.
The donkey waits outside. We will see how she does, but if it looks like we might, in fact, miss Christmas in Bethlehem because of her slow pace, I will have to trade her in for a younger animal.

A-levels show rise in top grades
Pupils in Colchester phone back the news about their A-level results
A-level results have improved again - with more exams being passed and more entries achieving the top grades.
This year's results, from more than three quarters of a million exams, show that boys are beginning to catch up with higher-achieving girls.
The pass rate has risen 0.6 of a percentage point from 2003 to 96%, and 22.4% of entries received an A-grade - up from 21.6% last year.
Examiners, head teachers and education ministers rejected claims that this was
because exams were getting easier.
"Don't let anyone tell you that standards have dropped because more of you have done well. This is simply a myth," said School Standards Minister David Miliband, as results showed the 22nd consecutive increase.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Miliband attacked the "national disease" of being cynical about improved exam results.
A-LEVEL RESULTS 2004
96% pass, up from 95.4% last year
A grades: 23.7% girls, 21% boys; last year 22.9% girls, 20% boys
Fastest increasing subjects: Religious studies, law
69% of all results are A to C grades
40% of young people take A-levels
Total A-level entries: 766,247
But because so many entries are now achieving the highest grades, there are to be discussions this autumn about how universities can distinguish between the best students.
A review of the curriculum by former chief inspector, Mike Tomlinson, has already proposed that pupils might write an extended essay, which could be used in university admissions.
And there have been suggests that universities could be given students' individual percentage marks - rather than an overall grade.
Head teachers' leader David Hart said he could see no reason why universities should not be given this information.
And the director of the Joint Council for Qualifications, Ellie Johnson-Searle, said that such detailed information about exam performance was available if universities wanted it.
The Conservative education spokesman, Tim Collins, said that he backed the publication of students' individual marks - and said that it was preferable to universities setting their own admission tests.
'Denigration'
This year's results show that more entries than ever were awarded a pass - with 96% achieving a grade A to E, up from 95.4% last year.
The long-awaited results arrive at Derby College
But examiners were resolute that this was not an indication of "dumbing down" or "grade inflation".
Dr Johnson-Searle said the "grades awarded are absolutely a reflection of what students have earned" - and she denied that standards were lower or that there were "softer" subjects which would give higher grades.
This was supported by David Hart, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, who said improvements were the "result of better teaching and hard work by students".
The National Union of Students also attacked the "constant denigration" of improving results.
"Any other country would be celebrating the educational achievements of its students ... but we seem incapable of doing that," NUS president Kat Fletcher said.
Boys improving
Boys in particular have shown improvements this year - narrowing the gap with girls in both the number of passes and A grades.
MOST POPULAR A-LEVEL SUBJECTS
English
General studies
Maths
Biology
Psychology
"Many secondary schools have put a lot of effort into raising attainment for boys - and inevitably it will flow through to results," said Mr Hart.
Measures had included putting boys into single-sex classes, he said. And the improving results showed that boys were getting the message that they could not be "lazy and complacent".
There were also variations within the number of A grades in different parts of the UK, with Northern Ireland achieving 30%, Wales 23.5% and England 22.1%.
This year's results also reveal trends in popularity for different subjects - with growing interest in religious education, law, psychology and media.
DECLINING A-LEVEL SUBJECTS
Computing
Information technology
German
Science
Physics
There were further declines in the number of students taking French A-level - now down to 15,000 - and a slump in candidates for computer-related A-levels.
While "traditional" subjects such as English and maths remain among the most commonly studied, there are now more A-level students taking psychology than chemistry and more taking media studies than French.
'Insults'
Students are also receiving AS-level and vocational qualification results - with the exam boards saying that AS-level results showed a slight improvement on last year.
Although applauding the achievements of A-level candidates, Conservative spokesman Tim Collins said that the government should not be dismissive of doubts raised about exam standards. "We have to recognise that there are a growing number of academics and employers who have concerns - and those concerns need to be genuinely addressed and not just greeted with childish insults ... saying anyone with any questions are elitists," said Mr Collins.
Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis called for the current exam system to be replaced with a Baccalaureate system, which would allow pupils to "mix and match" different science, arts and vocational subjects.

Development firm eyes port plans
Developers are studying the investment potential in Stranraer
An international development company is considering taking the lead in a multi-million pound scheme to regenerate Stranraer waterfront.
It comes after claims the project had been "downgraded" in Scottish Government priorities.
The firm has signed a 90-day agreement to negotiate with ferry operator Stena Line and Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Local councillor Robert Higgins said that if a deal could be struck it could transform the town.
Last month the council voiced concerns that improvement plans had gone from being a "national" to a "local" priority. A government spokesman said at the time it still wanted the project to succeed and deliver benefits for the area. However, it has now emerged that private business could take the lead in helping regenerate the area.
Although the name of the company has not been revealed it is understood to be a major international development firm.
Councillor Higgins said it could be a huge boost to the area if it resulted in long-term investment in the town.
'Place of importance'
He added: "This company came and looked at Scotland as a desktop exercise and Stranraer is where they selected.
"That tells you something - it is not a forgotten bit of water, it can be a place of major importance.
"This is probably one of the most exciting things in my lifetime if it all comes to pass and I sincerely hope it does."
The news was also welcomed by Dumfries and Galloway MP Russell Brown.
He said: "Obviously this is encouraging news.
"Significant private investment will be essential to delivering a successful regeneration project, and hopefully the council can work positively with this developer to take the waterfront scheme forward."

Piltdown Man went from being one of the biggest discoveries of the 20th Century to being its greatest scientific embarrassment.
On 21 November 1953, the fossils discovered 40 years earlier and acclaimed as the "missing link" between apes and humans were finally revealed to be forgeries.
Today, the word Piltdown is a term of abuse, used to label any fraudulent or shoddy research. Click through these pages to read more about the fake hominid.

And goalkeeper Craig Nelson looks set to follow, according to the Second Division club's website. City chairman David Birse said: "It's good for us at this stage. They make up some of the nucleus of our team and are lads that we really wanted to keep."

PF Unity dominate in Nottingham
Rookie reporter at Your Game Nottingham
Unity dominated the competition with their free-flowing football
Positive Futures Unity stole the show at Your Game Nottingham thanks to a keenly contested final between two of the project's three teams.
PF Unity 1 booked their place in the national final thanks to a 1-0 victory against PF Unity 3 courtesy of a late strike from Aswad Allen.
Both teams had scored freely in the group stages, but the final turned into a battle of the keepers as Unity 3's Rhys Keep and Unity 1's Adonai Scarlet produced a string of outstanding saves until Allen's crisp finish.
Incredibly, it was the only goal the aptly named Rhys Keep had conceded in the entire day and the goalkeeper was rewarded with Radio Five Live Most Valuable Player award.
Also on their way to the final are Young People United, a team representing the Leicester Race Equality Forum who won the Fair Play Award.
Football has forgotten about the inner city, we have to get people off the street and playing the game they love
Former Forest striker David Johnson
England star Sue Smith dropped in to the Southglade Leisure Centre in Bestwood to play in an exhibition match against ladies' champions Saffron Young People's Project.
"It's a fantastic project to get kids off the streets and giving them the opportunity to play football," said the Leeds striker.
"It's something I really wanted to be involved with. A lot of these players haven't had the best upbringing or had the opportunities I had when I was younger.
"So to see them enjoying themselves is just fantastic - and some of them are seriously talented players." Also cheering from the sidelines was the former Nottingham Forest striker David Johnson, who dropped by to offer his support.
"It's such a great idea, something like this would never happen without sponsorship or backing," said Johnson. "A lot of these players would never have the chance to use the facilities here, it's top draw - this is what football is all about.
"Football has forgotten about the inner city, we have to get people off the street and playing the game they love."
As well as the football there was music from 1Xtra DJs L Double and Jason Mitchell and a graffiti masterclass from local artists Ongabonga and Oxygen Thievez.
Radio Five Live commentator Darren Fletcher was on hand to uncover a few potential new stars.
And he awarded the Five Live Best Commentator award to Ryan Beaumont, while Adam Brown took home a DAB radio after winning the 1Xtra Best DJ award.
And Top Man's Liam Herne won the Hardest Kick competition after hammering an incredible shot of 79mph.
