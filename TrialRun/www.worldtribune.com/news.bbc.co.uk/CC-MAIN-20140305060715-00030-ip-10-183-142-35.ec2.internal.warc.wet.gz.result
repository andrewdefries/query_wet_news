Zimbabwe escapes diamond sale ban
It is alleged widespread human rights abuses took place in Marange
Zimbabwe has escaped suspension from the Kimberly process - the certification scheme which regulates the sale of so-called blood diamonds.Instead, the 70-member international diamond trade body has agreed to give Zimbabwe more time to reform its mining practices. Rights groups alleged soldiers killed about 200 people at a diamond field last year, which the government denies. The decision came as talks to save the unity government started in Mozambique. The coalition administration - formed in February - has been in crisis since Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai began boycotting cabinet meetings last month. Mr Tsvangirai is protesting at the way President Robert Mugabe is implementing the power-sharing deal. RevenueThe BBC's southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen says the compromise diamond deal agreed in Namibia is likely to anger human rights groups. President Mugabe says he has met his side of the unity deal
Although its own investigators found killings and forced evictions from the Marange diamond fields in the east of the country close to the border with Mozambique, the Kimberley Process panel stopped short of kicking Zimbabwe out, she says. Instead it has adopted a plan - proposed by Zimbabwe itself - which includes calls for an independent inspector to monitor diamonds leaving the controversial fields. Human rights groups claim the diamonds have been an important source of revenue for the military and for President Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. Meanwhile, Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai are both attending the talks in Mozambique organised by leaders of the Southern African Development Community (Sadc). Former opposition leader Mr Tsvangirai has accused his long-time rival of being a "dishonest and unreliable partner" in the power-sharing deal, which was struck last year. The opposition MDC party also accuses Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party of persecuting its officials. Zanu-PF has described the accusations as "propaganda". Human Rights Watch recently urged Sadc leaders to press Zanu-PF to end what it called "ongoing human rights abuses".

Les Miserables wins musical vote
Elaine Paige handed the award to producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh
Les Miserables has come top of a poll to find the UK's favourite musical.
The show, first performed 25 years ago, received 40% of the 400,000 votes in the BBC Radio 2 survey, beating The Phantom of the Opera into second place.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers came third with The King and I in fourth place. But Cats, Grease and The Sound of Music all failed to make the top 10.
Les Miserables producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said he was "completely knocked out" by the result.
The show, set during the French uprisings of the 1840s, was adapted from Victor Hugo's novel and made its debut in Paris in 1980.

It has been playing in London's West End since 1985 and reached Broadway in 1987.
Producers boast the show has been seen by more than 50 million people around the world.
The poll results were announced by Elaine Paige, who starred in Chess and Cats, on her Radio 2 show.
The contest ran for six months with 50 shows in contention.
Sunset Boulevard came fifth with Evita in sixth and Chess at seven.
Eighth place went to The Rocky Horror Show with Follies in ninth and Hair rounding out the top 10.
Radio 2's head of live music and events Lewis Carnie said: "The fact there were 400,000 votes is phenomenal - it shows the passion that listeners have for musical theatre."

BBC News | ENTERTAINMENT | Branagh's musical Bard
low graphics version | feedback | help

Branagh's musical Bard
Talk of the town: Branagh's musical Shakespeare
Kenneth Branagh has unveiled his latest Shakespeare project - taking the Bard into the 1930s.
His all-singing, all-dancing version of Love's Labour's Lost features Fred Astaire dance routines and period songs by Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Irving Berlin.
The production, which stars Branagh, Alicia Silverstone, Timothy Spall and Adrian Lester - was launched at the Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday, and with a special screening in London the same evening.
Alicia Silverstone: Thought Branagh had "lost his mind"
Branagh - who directs and stars in the musical - told reporters in the German capital: "I just loved the songs of this period. They seem to go perfectly with the subject matter of this play."
Shakespeare's courtly rakes become fashionable lounge lizards in Branagh's version, and their pledge to avoid the pleasures of the flesh disappears when they discover aristocratic beauties dressed in Cyd Charisse gowns.
It features Busby Berkeley-style dance routines, including a synchronised swimming sequence. "I love the utter silliness and excessiveness of those swimming pool routines," said Branagh.
But his cast only had three weeks to rehearse - and few of them had any experience in musicals.
'Not Fred Astaire'
Branagh admitted the performances might not be as polished as he would have hoped for. "None of us are Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers," he said.
They are, however, supported by New York stage performer Nathan Lane as the clown, Costard. A veteran of Broadway shows such as Guys And Dolls and A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum, he joked: "I tried not to let them drag me down. No, actually, I thought everyone did a terrific job. I didn't feel embarrassed at all."
British comedy star Timothy Spall also features
Alicia Silverstone said she was shocked when Branagh asked her to play a French princess. "I thought he had lost his mind."
But she was full of praise for the British actor and director.
"With him you know exactly what you're doing. I want to work with him again and again and again."
Branagh, who has already made versions of Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing and Henry V, rejected suggestions he was cheapening Shakespeare by turning it into a musical - adding he thought he was taking a "bold step".
He said he hoped the film would encourage people to see Shakespeare on stage.
"Hopefully it can work both ways, and Shakespeare can travel a bit further in film," he added.
The film is released in the UK on 24 March.

BBC wins battle over Dalek book
The Daleks were introduced in the first series of Doctor Who in 1963
A BBC book about Doctor Who's legendary foes the Daleks has been cleared of infringing copyright in London.
The case was brought by publishers JHP, who printed four books with stories by Dalek creator Terry Nation in the 60s.
Managing director Paul Fishman said the BBC's Dalek Survival Guide, published in 2002, used material from those books and violated JHP's copyright.
At the High Court, Mr Justice Norris said JHP held a licence to publish the original books, but not the copyright.
Mr Justice Norris said: "The Daleks first became known to humankind in 1963 when they appeared in the first series of Dr Who.
"They were some of the most engaging and enduring creations of the fertile mind of the late Terry Nation."
The Daleks were voted Doctor Who's scariest villains last year
JHP published three Dalek annuals plus the Dalek Pocketbook and Space-Travellers Guide - billed as an "encyclopaedic guide to the Daleks and their secrets" - in the 1960s.
Paul Fishman - son of Mr Nation's friend and collaborator Jack Fishman - went to the BBC in 2001 to discuss a new venture using the original books and new material.
But Fishman disliked the plans drawn up by BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, and the two sides stopped working together.
BBC Worldwide released The Dalek Survival Guide the following year, describing it as a "secret dossier on this deadly breed of embossed exterminators".
'Cheap and nasty'
The light-hearted manual promised "to provide the public with the information they need to withstand the inevitable - a Dalek attack".
Mr Fishman described it as "cheap and nasty" and said it copied material from JHP's Dalek Pocketbook.
But Mr Justice Norris decided there had not been substantial copying and it was "inherently improbable" that Mr Nation would have assigned his copyright to the publishing company.
A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: "We are extremely pleased that Mr Justice Norris has ruled in our favour today and found that we did not infringe any copyright or use unauthorised material in our publication The Dalek Survival Guide.
"BBC Worldwide has vigorously defended this litigation and we're pleased the matter has now concluded."

Israeli union ends general strike
Previous strikes have cost Israel tens of millions of dollars
Israel's main trade union has called off a general strike that halted most international flights, closed banks and shut down many public services.
The powerful Histadrut union ended the eight-hour strike after signing a deal with the finance ministry to end a crisis over unpaid wages.
The union said about 3,500 workers had not been paid for months.
But the union said a deal had now been struck and workers would be paid "today or tomorrow".
"I hereby announce that the strike is over and all workers can go back to their jobs," said Ofer Eini, the secretary general of Histadrut.
Finance Minister Abraham Hirchson said: "The government did everything so that this painful problem would be solved and not recur."
He promised workers would receive their wages and the economy would "continue booming".
'Municipal mismanagement'
About 400,000 workers went on strike at 0900 local time (0700 GMT) after overnight talks with the government had failed to resolve the row.
In the past, similar strikes have led to rubbish piling up in the streets and stopped phone and electricity services.
Israel has struggled for years with malfunctions in a number of its municipalities. There have been allegations of the mismanagement of funds, cronyism and in some cases embezzlement.
The strike's end will allow many England fans to fly to Israel to see their team play Israel in a crucial Euro 2008 championship qualifier match on Saturday.
The union had already agreed to an exemption allowing the England team's plane to land on Thursday.
At least 4,000 England fans are expected for the match, in a significant boost to Israel's tourism industry hard-hit by the country's war with Lebanon last year.

Defending our homes from flooding
By Sarah Bell
BBC News website
Five million people in England and Wales are at risk of flooding
Cars floating down city streets and fire crews pumping water now seem a regular part of the UK landscape. Even the best flood defences could not prevent the chaos hitting cities like Sheffield, the Environment Agency says.
Our towns and cities need to be 'climate change-proofed' to cope with this unusual weather, which will happen more regularly, it claims.
As people mop up from the latest floods, can more be done to protect our towns and cities from rising water?
The Environment Agency says global warming means we face extreme floods more regularly in the future. Permeable pavements
Five million people in England and Wales are currently at risk from flooding, with two million homes built in the floodplain of rivers or vulnerable parts of the coast. Phil Rothwell, head of flood risk policy at the agency, says they already identify areas which are likely to flood, but it is difficult to predict how exactly they will be affected.
All sorts of things can be done to design the urban landscape to enable us to withstand these major events in future
Phil Rothwell Environment Agency
This weather has never been seen before in Sheffield, which is not prone to flooding. He says flood defences are not the only way to protect homes.
"People generally don't want their houses surrounded by 50 foot walls. There is a balance to be struck between defences and softer options," he said.
"All sorts of things can be done to design the urban landscape to enable us to withstand these major events in future."
This includes introducing permeable pavements which allow water to absorb into the ground, reducing the amount flowing across streets and into houses. Playing fields and green space can be put next to rivers so the water can be absorbed.
Houses in flood risk areas can be designed to ensure they are better able to withstand flooding with features such as power points installed halfway up walls.
Stilts
For example, some homes in the flood-prone Thames Gateway are being built on stilts.
The Environment Agency has asked for �150m from the government to bring flood defences up to peak condition. As many scientists link extreme weather to global warming, becoming more environmentally friendly will help, experts say. HAVE YOUR SAY

Chris Williams, managing director of Hydro-International, which has been working on flood issues for 25 years, says making new buildings should be made eco-friendly. Currently there is only a voluntary code and government regulation is needed, he says.
"Making sure that homes are energy-efficient buildings and are made from energy-efficient materials will help reduce their carbon footprint," he said.
"We also need to provide increased storage for water with with features like ponds on sites and underground storage tanks to hold rainwater back during storms."
Rainwater re-use should also be considered, he said. People could reuse water for everything but drinking using sophisticated water butts. Flood defences
One place which knows the damage caused by flooding only too well is Boscastle in Cornwall, devastated in 2004.
Torrential rain caused an estimated 440 million gallons of water to flood the historic village, destroying over 50 homes and many businesses.
Since then, flood defences have been installed, which helped protect the village from a three-foot torrent of water when heavy rain struck again on 21 June. North Cornwall MP, Dan Rogerson said: "The new flood defences have done their job and kept the river within its banks."

Judge says courts 'overstretched'
Lord Phillips said the courts are "seriously overstretched"
The most senior judge in England and Wales has said a "stream" of legislation had contributed to courts being "seriously overstretched". In his annual review of the courts, The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, said some legislation reflects the "politicisation" of sentencing. And he said a new judicial appointments system had caused a shortage of judges.
The Judicial Appointments Commission said average waiting times for new judges had been reduced.
A spokeswoman for the body, which is involved in the new system for appointing judges, said: "The Judicial Appointments Commission has reduced the average time for the stages under its control - from closing date for applications to submission of selections to the Lord Chancellor - from 24 weeks under the former DCA to 19 weeks." Court buildings
In his report, the judge highlighted various reasons for the problems, including a series of computer glitches. In addition to the shortage of judges caused by the new appointments system, he also cited a backlog in repairs to court buildings. "It is vital that the system is better placed to phase the implementation of new appointments to take over from those being replaced within a shorter period of time," he said. The judge added that the state of the 700 buildings in the court estate was an area of "ever-growing concern". According to his report, the maintenance backlog stands at �200m, of which �90m was required for "urgent operational requirements". Prison numbers
BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw said: "Although he doesn't say so directly, he [Lord Phillips] also appears to blame the government - for introducing too many new laws for political motives." Lord Phillips said the task of those passing sentences has been made "infinitely more complex by a stream of legislation". Ministers are currently considering plans for a commission to regulate sentences to control prison numbers. But Lord Phillips warned that it must not "fetter the judge's discretion" to impose sentences which reflect the different circumstances of each case. E-mail this to a friend

Labour 'floundering' on migration
Immigration into the UK remains a controversial subject
The government is "floundering around" on UK immigration because it believes the issue is an "electoral liability", the shadow home secretary has said.
Dominic Grieve spoke out after the government said the number of migrants entering via the points system may have to be cut owing to the economic crisis.
Immigration Minister Phil Woolas told the Times immigration became "extremely thorny" if people were losing jobs.
The Tories have urged the government to show how they would deliver the plans.
Mr Woolas said the government would not allow the UK population to pass 70 million.
He said setting a population policy - which would be a first for Labour - would enable the government to set a limit on migration.
Tough talk is simply not enough
Dominic Grieve, shadow home secretary
How points workSend us your comments
In a wide-ranging interview Mr Woolas, who became immigration minister earlier this month, told the Times: "It's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it's going to get harder.
"There has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving."
Tougher immigration policies would also require getting the British "back to work", for example with more retraining for the unemployed, he said.
Mr Grieve said Labour were matching Tory policies on setting immigration limits.
But he insisted it needed to be "carefully explained".
"The government hasn't got to grips with this issue at all, and that they're floundering around because they know it's now become a serious electoral liability."
He added: "Tough talk is simply not enough, they must now explain how they intend to deliver."
'Powerful controls'
The government recently introduced a new points-based system to attract migrants from outside the EU to certain jobs.
The Home Office said the UK's new system provided "a powerful and flexible set of controls" which allowed it to "raise or lower the bar" according to needs.
What are you going to say to the employer who is desperate to fill a job, but can't find anyone suitable in the European economic area?
Keith Best, chief executive, Immigration Advisory Service
Analysis: The question of quotas
Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the population grew by nearly two million to 60,975,000 people between 2001 and 2007.
Various official projections predict this to rise to 77m in 2051 or 110m in 2081.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said it was significant Mr Woolas had quoted an upper limit for the UK population.
The government had previously shied away from setting a "population policy" because it was difficult for ministers to explain how it would be managed, he said.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Keith Best, Immigration Advisory Service: 'Migrants tend to get blamed'
This is because immigration from inside the EU cannot be controlled, and neither can a limit be placed on genuine claims for asylum.
Former Labour minister Frank Field, a member of a cross-party group on immigration, welcomed Mr Woolas's comments.
The MP for Birkenhead said when the country was moving into a recession the immigration policy suitable for a boom was unsuitable.
He said the key was to "break the link" between people coming to the UK to work and gaining citizenship, which increased the population.
'Distorted picture'
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch, which argues for balanced migration, told BBC Five Live Mr Woolas's remarks showed a significant development in the immigration debate.
"This is the very first time that a government minister has recognised the link between immigration and population," he said.
But the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, Keith Vaz, said he disagreed with Mr Woolas.
A Labour government had never supported a quota for immigration, he said, adding that the points-based system was based on needs of the economy and not numbers.
He said the government should avoid providing a vehicle for the "distorted picture the far right will want to portray".
People have looked for scapegoats in immigrant communities for economic problems and in fact exactly the opposite is the case
Chris Huhne, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman
Keith Best, chief executive of the Immigration Advisory Service, said immigration quotas were not workable in a modern trading economy.
"What are you going to say to the employer who is desperate to fill a job, but can't find anyone suitable in the European economic area?" he said.
"Are you going to say 'sorry, the quota has been filled, you'll have to wait till next year'?"
Chris Huhne, the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesman, said it was surprising the issue was being considered now, when many immigrants were returning home because of the financial crisis.
"I do find it rather worrying that Labour and the Conservatives seem to be opening up this debate now at a time when traditionally people have looked for scapegoats in immigrant communities for economic problems, and in fact exactly the opposite is the case.
"The people who get the hardest hit first are often migrant communities."

Fish farming policy unveiled
Concerns have been raised about pollution
Plans for the future of fish farming have been outlined by Deputy Environment Minister Allan Wilson.
Mr Wilson said the measures detailed in the Strategic Framework for Aquaculture were aimed at ensuring a sustainable future for the industry in Scotland.
Environmentalists have voiced concern about a growing problem of pollution from fish farms and escapes of stock.
The minister promised that, should Labour remain in power after the Holyrood elections in May, �100,000 would be set aside annually to support the establishment of a Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum.
The framework signals the Scottish Executive's commitment to an aquaculture industry which develops sustainably
Allan Wilson, Deputy Environment Minister
Efforts would be made to address concerns about fish farming on other marine life, including a shake-up of monitoring systems and guidelines for producers and regulators.
The minister also promised a review of policies on the situation or relocation of fish farms in coastal areas.
Environmental group Friends of the Earth Scotland said there was a clear need to update the current legislation on fish farming.
Speaking at the Sea Change Conference in Dunblane, Mr Wilson said the Scottish Executive's broad consultation had included views from industry and environmental groups, as well as regulators and those in the retail sector.
Plans for regulation were welcomed
He said: "The framework signals the Scottish Executive's commitment to an aquaculture industry which develops sustainably, and our recognition of the important contribution the industry makes to Scotland's economy, particularly in rural areas."
Green MSP Robin Harper said he was pleased that regulations were being introduced for an industry that "is largely unregulated".
However, he said: "The failure of the executive to urgently bring in revised locational guidelines in order to get these fish farms moved from the mouths of salmon rivers and other sensitive areas, means that sea lice will continue to decimate wild salmon and trout for at least another three years.
"Wild salmon are being driven to extinction in Scottish rivers and there is clear evidence pointing to fish farms.
"I have repeatedly called for assistance to be provided to fish farmers to enable the most poorly situated salmon farms to be moved immediately."
'Vital industry'
Lord Lindsay, chairman of Scottish Quality Salmon, also addressed the conference and stressed that investment was crucial.
He said: "The launch of the Strategic Framework for Aquaculture is a positive commitment by the Scottish Executive to a confident and forward-looking strategic direction for a vital Scottish industry.
"Scottish aquaculture deserves this recognition so that it can build on its success to date and, with a proper strategic framework, deliver ever greater benefits to all interests through competitiveness, investments and sustainability."
Environmental campaign group WWF Scotland said regulation was a step forward.

United boss praises Rooney debut
Updated 29 September 2004, 11.18
Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has said that Wayne Rooney's first game for the club was as good as any debut he has ever seen.
The 18-year-old England striker scored a brilliant Champions League hat-trick in a 6-2 win over Fenerbahce. Sir Alex said: "It is a great start for him. That's why we signed him - he's got great potential."
Manchester United are so impressed with Rooney that they've brought his 13-year-old brother to the club as well.

The Sun newspaper reports John has been put into their kids' training school of excellence and the club hopes the attacking midfielder could even be better than his big brother.
But Ferguson warned United's rivals that he expects Wayne to get better and better.
"I think he can only get stronger. The important thing for me as a coach is to allow the boy to develop naturally without too much public attention. I want him to be as ordinary as he can."

Premier League seeks Grant letter
Grant may be allowed to continue at Chelsea past the New Year
The Premier League is still awaiting documentation that will allow new Chelsea manager Avram Grant an extension to attain a Uefa pro licence.
The 52-year-old Israeli can manage the club for a 12-week period without the necessary Uefa certificate.
However, the Blues believe Grant has the equivalent qualifications that will allow him to continue beyond that.
"Chelsea will be sending the documents to make their case," a Premier League spokesman told BBC Sport.
News conference: LMA chairman Howard Wilkinson
It is understood the qualifications Grant gained from his time coaching in Israel are only of a similar standard to the 'A' licence.
Chelsea have this 12-week period to satisfy the Premier League guidelines rule Q4.
This states that the person must have a pro license or commenced with a pro license course; hold an Football Association diploma, or have/be engaged in gaining an equivalent qualification.
The pro licence requires 240 hours of study and usually takes a year to attain.
One thing that disappoints us greatly is when clubs don't check beforehand
LMA's Howard Wilkinson
In the past the Premier League has granted extensions beyond the 12-week period of grace in a couple of exceptional cases. Glenn Roeder received an extension on health grounds while Gareth Southgate was deemed to have had restricted opportunities to gain a licence because of his international career. Martin O'Neill was also granted an exemption after undergoing a five-day refresher course. Howard Wilkinson, chairman of the League Managers' Association, said he was disappointed Chelsea had not checked to see whether Grant had the pro licence.
"I don't want to get involved in personalities. This is not about Avram Grant, this is a matter of principle," he said.
"We do not have any issue about the rules being tweaked, we are not against that if the move in general is to have better-qualified coaches working in this country.
"But one thing that disappoints us greatly is when clubs don't check beforehand.
"If BA employ a pilot they are not going to say afterwards, 'By the way, do you have a pilot's licence?' It's not a bad idea to make sure he has got a licence before you give him the job.
"It would help if these big corporations spent a bit of time and energy determining these sorts of factors first."
Uefa technical director Andy Roxburgh reiterated the importance of holding a pro licence.
"If we are going to have a licencing system then it is important the system is applied," said the former Scotland coach.

BBC SPORT | Fun and Games | Whose sandwich is it anyway?

By Chris Charles Egg and tomato man
With this year's Open being held at Sandwich, it would have been rude not to have a stab at competitors' eating habits. When these golfing superstars fancy a nibble on a sarnie, what filling would be most suited to their particular personality and style of play?
Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the Magnificent Seven - proving once again that old adage you are what you eat.
Jean van de Velde
Artichoke and walnut. A couple of bites of this little beauty and you'll be feeling on top of the world - almost as if you could walk on water. Word of warning, though - as you near the end of your feast, you may experience a choking feeling - and a sudden desire to roll your trouser legs up.
Ernie Els Ham baguette. The perfect snack for a man they call the Big Easy.
Take one large baguette and fill with ham. How easy is that?
Colin Montgomerie
Mexican beans and sour cream bap. Big and round and full of beans, but if left out in the sun for too long can go off without warning.
Not too popular with the American market.
Jesper Parnevik Jam and pickled onions, coated in volcanic dust and fried off in a rich, mud batter. Well what do you expect when your old man's the Swedish equivalent of Benny Hill and you're two sandwiches short of a picnic?
Phil Mickelson
Mussels And Jam On Rye, Dipped In Salt And Sauteed Till Extra Rare. Or M.A.J.O.R. D.I.S.A.S.T.E.R. for short.
Not that he ever gets to actually taste it - every time he gets tantalisingly close to taking a bite, the filling slips out the other end. John Daly
The doorstep challenge: All-you-can-eat-for-a-fiver mega special.
Four foot loaf, sawn in half and crammed with 3lbs of sausages, 20 rashers of bacon, a couple of juicy steaks, half a dozen eggs and an unhealthy coating of lard. Twice.
Tiger Woods
Kryptonite, spinach and iron filings, cunningly disguised as a cheeseburger in case anyone thinks he's superhuman. In fact he really has been eating cheesburgers for the past year or so - just to throw everyone off the scent. E-mail this to a friend
