Detroit's desperate struggle
By Jorn Madslien
Business reporter, BBC News, Windsor, Canada
Memories of a time when the American Dream was real are vivid as local rock'n'roll singer Jody Raffoul takes to the stage at the aptly named Chrysler Theatre in Windsor. There'll be another Detroit
Jody Raffoul, musician
Think Bruce Springsteen meets Bono. Think of the 1980s, of blue jeans, white T-shirts and black leather jackets. And last, but not least, think of big, enviable American cars. Jody, through his music, offers a flashback to a time before Motown - formerly famously confident and globally admired - crumpled into a pitiful shadow of its former self. "My father worked for Ford, all my uncles and my sister worked for Chrysler," Jody says.
"I still have friends who work for the car companies, but I also know many who've been laid off."
Out of work
Detroit and its Canadian neighbour Windsor have seen their automotive workforce halved in the last six years, observes Sean McAlinden, chief economist and vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research in Detroit. Consequently, the state of Michigan has suffered what Mr McAlinden describes as a "single-state recession", its 7.5% unemployment rate set to rise to 8.5% by spring, well beyond the 5% US average.
Michigan has suffered "the highest unemployment rate in the US for the last four years", observes Mr McAlinden, hence the economy has become the key issue ahead of Tuesday's primary election in the state. In the Province of Ontario, meanwhile, the jobless rate rose to 6.5% in December, well beyond the 5.9% Canadian average.
Pledge
Canada has been hit hard as the country's dollar has soared to parity with the Greenback, thus making exports to its main trading partner, the US, more expensive.
Detroit is struggling to hang on as auto capital of the world
Hence, while Jody spent Friday night giving the locals' rage and frustration a voice, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the country's premiers gathered for a four-hour dinner to hammer out a solution. None was found. Instead, the night ended with "little more than a pledge to share ideas about how to shelter an economy that has just experienced its heaviest losses in almost five years", the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail wrote the following morning. Out of line
The crisp night air hits the concert crowd as they pour into Windsor's broad and largely deserted streets.
Across the Detroit river, the US city's brightly lit towers of power rise proudly towards the starry skies, their confident posture belying an enduring crisis that has pretty much ripped the underbelly out of Motown in recent years. Even American buyers have been deserting Detroit's Big Three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - who currently deliver only about half the cars sold in the US, having seen their market share slip 7% in the last year. Their market share is declining in a market that is set to shrink this year to less than 16 million vehicle sales for the first time in a decade, amidst growing concern that the US is slipping into recession. The sharp decline offers a stark warning, yet there are few signs that the slide is coming to a halt as Detroit gets ready for this year's auto show. Out of touch
Chrysler, the US carmaker that was recently sold by German group Daimler to private equity investors, is set to make a big splash when it drives a herd of cattle through Detroit's streets on Sunday to launch its new Dodge Ram pickup truck. Farmers have been arriving in Detroit for Chrysler's cattle race Ford, meanwhile, is going big on its redesigned F-150 pickup, the best-selling vehicle in the US.
Such a focus on gas-guzzling pickup trucks, although there is still a market for them, is going a bit "against the grain", says auto analyst Michael Robinet of CSM, referring to how environmental concerns and regulation are forcing a shift towards smaller cars, many already being marketed by European and Asian rivals. The future, he predicts, will be one involving not only "a lot of changes to the type of vehicles built here" in the US. In addition, there will be other "players who will be building cars here".
These newcomers over time could include carmakers from India and China as well as existing ones such as Toyota, Hyundai and BMW, which have already invested massively further north in Canada or in southern US states.
But they seem unlikely to build their new plants in Detroit or Windsor. "There'll be another Detroit," laments Jody. "There'll be another USA."

BBC News | EUROPE | Mafia 'gripping Italian economy'

Letter From America UK UK Politics Business Sci/Tech Health Education Entertainment Talking Point In Depth AudioVideo Tuesday, 14 November, 2000, 15:10 GMT
Mafia 'gripping Italian economy'
The Italian Mafia allegedly controls one in five businesses
Organised crime controls one business in five in Italy, according to statistics released by the country's leading trade association.
A conference organised by the association in Milan said that the Mafia controlled about 20% of all businesses.
It also had an annual turnover of about $133bn, the equivalent of 15% of GNP.
These businessmen talk a lot at conferences but not to the Prosecutor's Office
Milan chief prosecutor A conference document said that counterfeiting also accounted for a large slice of Italian industrial production.
Only Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and China reportedly earned more from illegally copying well-known internationally-branded products.
It said Mafia profits were being invested in real estate, clinics and retirement homes, supermarkets, hotels and restaurants.
And the fortunes made in these businesses would be "enough to pay off public debt, the ball and chain around Europe's ankle", the document added.
International failure
Sergio Bille, the president of Italy's business association, said not enough was being done internationally to combat organised crime.
The Mafia empire
20% of Italian businesses
15% of GNP
Combined capital of $800bn
More than $11bn investment in real estate
More than $11bn in financial investment
$15.5bn profits from counterfeiting and black market
And out of a combined capital of more than $800bn only 7% has been frozen and 3% actually confiscated, he was quoted as saying.
A senior police official said that countries which permitted offshore banking were to blame for the growth in criminal activities.
Scepticism
But Milan chief prosecutor Gerardo d'Ambrosio expressed scepticism about the allegations made at the conference.
"In order to beat the Mafia, we need the co-operation of businessmen, and they don't always give us concrete facts upon which we can act," he said.
"I haven't had a single complaint since I took up my post here - these businessmen talk a lot at conferences but not to the Prosecutor's Office."
The Mafia is notorious for gaining control of institutions by using a mixture of bribery and fear, and then murdering those that cross them.
Prosecutor Giovanni Falcone was murdered in 1992
Both anti-Mafia judge Paolo Borsellino and then top anti-Mafia prosecutor, Giovanni Falcone, were murderedd in 1992.
Justice eventually caught up with seven leading members of the Italian Mafia who were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1999 for their part in the murder of Borsellino.
Those convicted included the former godfather of the Sicilian Mafia, Salvatore Riina, known as The Beast, who is already serving several life sentences for other crimes. Search BBC News Online

Zaha Hadid - building the future
Hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Prize
In a HardTalk Extra interview screened on 11 November, Gavin Esler spoke to architect Zaha Hadid about her visions for the future and why Britain needs to embrace daring architecture.
Click here to watch the full interview
Today Zaha Hadid is one of Britain's most successful architects, with high profile projects going ahead on three continents. But for almost three decades her ambitious designs remained unbuilt, some say because they were unbuildable. Since beginning her career in Britain, the Iraqi-born architect has made it her mission to champion avant garde design in a country she sees as obsessed with tradition. She tells Gavin Esler about her struggle for recognition and about her new projects, including the London Aquatic Centre for the Olympics in 2012.
HARDtalk Extra can be seen on Fridays on BBC World at 03:30 GMT, 08:30 GMT, 15:30 GMT, 18:30 GMT and 23:30 GMT.
It can also be seen on BBC News 24 at 04:30 and 23:30

Wales
Rhys Evans
Editor, Politics Show Wales
Millennium Centre
Part of a whole but a whole part - that, in essence, is the philosophy underpinning the Politics Show here in Wales.
Presented by Adrian Masters, the programme's aims are threefold. First, it seeks to join UK politics into a wider, Welsh whole, explaining why decisions taken at Westminster are relevant to you, the viewer. Secondly, the programme reflects Welsh politics, not only in Cardiff Bay but also across Wales. This means that where decisions are taken, the Politics Show team will be there, explaining what will happen, what has happened and why it matters. From council to quango, Westminster to Assembly, the emphasis is on telling the story of high politics in an user-friendly, interesting way.
From a practical point of view, this requires a substantial journalistic undertaking by the Politics Show team. Examples have to be found, researched thoroughly and filmed - always from all four corners of Wales - before any story can be put out on air. The third principle is good, old-fashioned journalism. Broadcast on a Sunday, the Politics Show occupies a highly privileged position in the broadcast calendar. Our job is also to tell you what will be news in the week to come. Now in its third year, Politics Show Wales has developed into a distinctive brand. From Ynys Mon to Monmouth, the Politics Show will be there for you. It is always about politics, but not as we always used to know it.
Politics Show Wales presented by Adrian Masters
Adrian Masters Presenter
Adrian Masters is the new presenter for the Politics Show in Wales. Adrian is one of BBC Wales' most experienced reporters, having spent the last twelve years covering news and politics. As part of the politics team, you will see him on Wales Today and hear him on Radio Wales. It is a job that takes him from the Politics Show studio to the National Assembly; from party conferences to town halls, but always at the heart of Welsh politics.
Over the years Adrian has interviewed most of the big players including Tony Blair in a stock room and John Prescott in a caravan cupboard. Before joining the Politics Show in Wales, Adrian was presenting BBC 2 Wales' daytime politics programme, AMPM, and has also been a reporter for Dragon's Eye on BBC 1 Wales.
Adrian has also contributed reports to Radio 4's "You and Yours" programme, BBC 5 Live and BBC 6 Music.
Until January 2004, he was the chief reporter for Radio Wales' breakfast programme "Good Morning Wales" during which time he twice won Radio Journalist of the Year.
Adrian trained as a journalist in London where he remembers being thrown out of his bedroom by the cast and crew of the Bill who intended to use it as a filming location. He returned to Wales to start his working life at Cardiff's commercial radio station, Red Dragon FM in 1993. During five years there, he was a News Reader, Presenter and deputy News Editor. One of his first jobs there was recording Neil Kinnock reciting the opening lines of War of the Worlds. Born and bred in Newport, he still lives in Wales' newest city with his wife Jane.

BBC News | SCI/TECH | 'Bizarre' planetary systems discovered

'Bizarre' planetary systems discovered
Astronomers have found two planetary systems they say are puzzling and that will raise new questions about how planets form.
We have never seen anything like this
Paul Butler, Carnegie Institution of Washington
The scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, US, say a star 123 light-years from Earth is being circled by two objects, one of which may be the biggest planet ever found.
In the second system, two planets orbit a star in a gravitationally synchronised "dance".
The discoveries were announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego. They are based on observations made at the Keck I telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Lick Observatory telescope in California. Hybrid planet
The leader of the planet-searching team, Geoffrey Marcy, said a star called HD168443, in the constellation Serpens, was being circled by a planet 17 times more massive than Jupiter. It is the largest planetary-like object to be found beyond our own Solar System. Star - HD168443
123 light-years away
One planet is 44m km from star. It has 7.7 Jupiter masses and orbital period of 58.1 days
Second planet is 430m km from star. It has 17.1 Jupiter masses and orbital period of 4.8 yrs
"This is more massive than a planet and it defies the conventional definition for a planet,'' said Marcy. The new body is big enough to be called a brown dwarf, an object too large to be a conventional planet but too small to qualify as a proper star. Such objects are not massive enough to ignite the nuclear reactions in their cores that would make them shine like stars.
"We have never seen anything like this,'' said Paul Butler, a Carnegie Institution of Washington astronomer who works closely with Marcy. "To call it a brown dwarf sweeps the mystery under the rug. It is a mystery system."
Profound implications
Marcy added: "This defies explanation. We don't know if it is a brown dwarf or some type of hybrid.'' Geoff Marcy and colleagues find the discoveries perplexing
Most of the 50 or so new planets found circling stars other than our Sun are two to three times more massive than Jupiter. The detection technique does not allow astronomers to find Earth-sized planets. "This is one of the most exciting discoveries yet,'' said Douglas Lin, of the University of California, Santa Cruz. "This discovery has profound theoretical implications.'' Marcy said a second planet in the HD168443 system had seven times the mass of Jupiter and orbited closer to its central star. He said both planets were probably huge gas balls, much like Jupiter and Saturn in our own Solar System. Strong resonance
Another announcement at the American Astronomical Society's conference detailed two small planets orbiting a star called Gliese 876, a red-dwarf star 15 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. Star - Gliese 876 15 light-years away
One planet is 31.5m km from star. It has 1.8 Jupiter masses and orbital period of 61 days
Second planet is 19.5m km from star. It has 0.56 Jupiter masses and orbital period of 30 days
Debra Fischer, a member of the Marcy-Butler team, said one planet was about half the mass of Jupiter and the other was 1.9 times more massive. She added that the planets' orbits were gravitationally locked to each other in what is termed a resonate orbit. One circles the star every 30 days, and the other takes 60.
"These two resonate planets seem to be humming in harmony. They are like two harmonic notes on a stringed instrument," she said. "We don't know how they could have gotten into that configuration,'' said Marcy. Jack Lissauer, from the American space agency Nasa, said: "The resonance between the two orbiting planets is among the most exciting planet detection discoveries to date. "This is the first extrasolar planetary system to show a strong resonance. It is also the smallest star known to have any orbiting planets, much less two." Search BBC News Online

'Supermodel' satellite set to fly
By Jonathan Amos
Science reporter, BBC News
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Neil Wallace reveals the inner workings of Goce's ion engine
Europe is set to launch one of its most challenging space missions to date.The Goce satellite will map minute variations in the pull of gravity experienced across the planet. Scientists will use its data to improve their understanding of how the oceans move, and to frame a universal system to measure height anywhere on Earth. The super-sleek spacecraft will go into orbit on a modified intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in north-west Russia. Lift-off for the Rockot vehicle is timed for 1421 GMT on Monday.
This is the most beautiful satellite that has ever been built
Reiner Rummel, Technical University of Munich
'Cruise control' for spacecraft
'Space arrow' to map Earth's tug
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Most satellites launched into space are ugly boxes. The European Space Agency's (Esa) Goce satellite is very different. "This is the most beautiful satellite that has ever been built - and for good reason," enthused one of the scientists who conceived the mission, Reiner Rummel, from the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Goce's striking good-looks are a requirement of the extremely testing environment in which it will have to operate. The arrow shape and fins are necessary to keep the spacecraft stable as it flies through the wisps of air still present at an altitude just under 270km. This orbit is much lower than for most Earth observation missions but will be essential if Goce is to sense the very subtle gravity anomalies that exist across the planet. "Our current knowledge of the Earth's gravity is incomplete," explained Danilo Muzi, Esa's Goce programme manager. "Gravity is the force we experience daily; it keeps our feet on the ground. But there is this general misconception that it is constant everywhere on the globe, which is not true. If we go to the North Pole we will weigh more than if we are at the equator." This extraordinary phenomenon is explained in part by the shape of the planet. It is not a perfect sphere - it is flatter at the poles, fatter at the equator. Its interior layers are also not composed of uniform shells of homogenous rock - some regions are thicker or denser.
Goce data will be used to construct an idealised surface called a geoid
More details This leads to an irregular distribution of mass; and as everything that has mass is pulled by gravity, its tug becomes irregular, too. The variations, though, are minuscule - almost imperceptible. Meeting the measurement challenge in itself resulted in two years' delay for the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (Goce). Engineers have had to work through immense technical difficulties. At the heart of the spacecraft is a device known as a gradiometer. "This is a very complex instrument," said Andrea Allasio, who led the production of the satellite at Thales Alenia Space in Italy. "It is, for sure, the most sophisticated gradiometer which has ever been prepared for a satellite." It consists of three pairs of "proof masses", or accelerometers. They are aligned at 90 degrees, across each axis. The entire set-up is mounted inside an ultra-stable casing. As Goce bumps through the Earth's gravity field, the accelerometers will sense the fantastically small disturbances.
"We have one comparison that we often make," explained Rune Floberghagen, Esa's Goce mission manager. "Imagine a snowflake, which has a fraction of a gram, slowly falling down on to the deck of a supertanker. The acceleration that the supertanker experiences from that snowflake is comparable to the sensitivity of our instrument," he told BBC News. There is however a potential showstopper: the low altitude Goce must fly to get the detail it seeks in the gravity signal. The constant buffeting the satellite receives from the residual air still present in the thermosphere would ordinarily drown out the data. So Goce employs an ion engine to maintain a steady path - a sort of cruise control. The engine is throttled up and down, producing exquisite levels of thrust by accelerating charged atoms of xenon through nozzles at the rear of the spacecraft. "We are an enabling technology on this mission; it couldn't happen without us," said Neil Wallace from Qinetiq, the UK technology firm which supplied the engine. "But then this mission has many such technologies." GRAVITY FIELD AND STEADY-STATE OCEAN CIRCULATION EXPLORER
1. The 1,100kg Goce is built from rigid materials and carries fixed solar wings. The gravity data must be clear of spacecraft 'noise'
2. Solar cells produce 1,300W and cover the Sun-facing side of Goce; the near side (as shown) radiates heat to keep it cool
3. The 5m-by-1m frame incorporates fins to stabilise the spacecraft as it flies through the residual air in the thermosphere
4. Goce's accelerometers measure accelerations that are as small as 1 part in 10,000,000,000,000 of the gravity experienced on Earth
5. The UK-built engine ejects xenon ions at velocities exceeding 40,000m/s; Goce's mission will end when the 40kg fuel tank empties
6. S Band antenna: Data downloads to the Kiruna (Sweden) ground station. Processing, archiving is done at Esa's centre in Frascati, Italy
7. GPS antennas: Precise positioning of Goce is required, but GPS data in itself can also provide some gravity field information
Goce's quest is to produce a snapshot of the Earth's gravity field at an unprecedented resolution. The data will inform a multitude of science disciplines: understanding how the mass of ocean waters circulate, moving heat around the planet, will assist climate prediction a better knowledge of the way mass is distributed inside the Earth will be useful to those who study geo-hazards such as volcanoes and earthquakes and because gravity defines what is meant by "up", "down" and "level", the new data can underpin a truly universal system to compare heights the world over Goce is the first of Esa's Earth Explorers, a series of spacecraft that will provide quick answers to key environmental questions. Six missions have so far been approved; a seventh is in discussion. All will use cutting-edge space technology to acquire their data.
Cryosat has been re-built and will launch later this year
Europe ice mission failure probed
The Goce mission has experienced a series of frustrating delays. It was sent to Plesetsk in August last year and should have orbited in September, but the satellite was then held on the ground because of niggling concerns about the readiness of its launcher system. The ghost that haunts this mission is the Cryosat satellite. The Esa spacecraft built to map the world's ice fields was supposed to be the first Earth Explorer but it was destroyed on launch in 2005 when its Rockot failed and ditched in the Arctic Ocean. "From the information we have seen from Eurockot (operator) and Khrunichev (manufacturer), we have seen they have done extensive testing," said Danilo Muzi. "On the basis of all the testing that has been done, and the fact that these tests were successful, then the confidence in the good status of the launcher has been restored," he told BBC News. Goce will be put into a sun-synchronous orbit, meaning the spacecraft will be kept in daylight for a sustained period of time. The Breeze-KM upper-stage booster will release Goce at an altitude of about 285km. The satellite will then gradually fall to its operational altitude of 263km, where its ion engine will maintain a steady orbit for the science campaign. Two major data-gathering periods are planned, each lasting about six months. The first should start in early September after all the in-orbit testing is complete. The mission will probably be extended if sufficient xenon is left, although some propellant will be needed to take the spacecraft safely out of the sky in a controlled burn-up over ocean waters. GRAVITY FIELD AND STEADY-STATE OCEAN CIRCULATION EXPLORER
1. Goce senses tiny variations in the pull of gravity over Earth 2. The data is used to construct an idealised surface, or geoid
3. It traces gravity of equal 'potential'; balls won't roll on its 'slopes'
4. It is the shape the oceans would take without winds and currents
5. So, comparing sea level and geoid data reveals ocean behaviour
6. Gravity changes can betray magma movements under volcanoes
7. A precise geoid underpins a universal height system for the world
8. Gravity data can also reveal how much mass is lost by ice sheets

McManaman's Spanish jackpot
McManaman: Protracted saga ends with departure to Madrid
Liverpool's Steve McManaman has agreed to join European champions Real Madrid in the summer.
Steve Wilson reports (BBC Radio 5 Live)He has signed a pre-contract agreement which will ultimately make him the best-paid British footballer of all time.
The news brings to an end a protracted saga over whether the Merseyside-born player would stay at Anfield.
Alan Kennedy: "Money may not have been the major motive"The 26-year-old will join the Spanish giants on a
five-year contract on 1 July, the day after his current deal runs
out.
According to reports McManaman will pick up between �53,000 and �60,000 a week
for the term of that contract.
But Liverpool will not receive a penny because of
the Bosman ruling.
It is British football's most stark example of the effect of the landmark judgment freeing out-of-contract players from transfer fees.
The European court directive dictates that players out of contract at the end
of the season can negotiate with interested clubs from 1 January.
Offer he could not refuse
"I am extremely sad to be leaving Liverpool FC," said McManaman.
"However the opportunity to be playing football for Real Madrid, the current
European and world champions, is too good to turn down and it helps me further
my ambition to test myself in another top European League."
Real chairman Lorenzo Sanz said: "This is big news for Real, and everything
is done. We have tracked him since the summer."
Player and club seek lift
McManaman has won England honours while at Anfield, but 350 games have brought only two trophies, including the 1995 League Cup, when he scored both goals in the final.
He played a starring role for his country in the Euro 96 tournament under Terry Venables, but injury has dogged him since.
Venables' successor Glenn Hoddle gave him only one
appearance as a substitute during the 1998 World Cup, and he has played just 12 games this season for Liverpool.
He will join a club still trying to recover from the hangover of their
European Cup final win against Juventus last summer. Real are currently sixth in
the Spanish Primera Liga and lost 4-0 at Deportivo La Coruna last weekend.

Sextuplet parents launch booklet
Graham and Jan Walton's six daughters were born in 1983
A new guide to help parents bringing up children is being launched by two high profile parents. Graham and Jan Walton, whose six daughters were born in 1983, are backing the Safe Parenting Handbook. The guide is being launched at Clubmoor Children's Centre, Liverpool with Graham talking about his experiences of bringing up the girls.
The booklet offers parents and carers information and advice about the varied challenges of child rearing.
It gives advice on issues such as coping with a young child, babysitting, cot death, and smacking, as well as domestic violence and internet safety.
'Fantastic handbook'
Graham said: "This is a fantastic handbook which would have proved extremely valuable to me during my early years as a parent.
"Although our circumstances were a little extreme, the information contained within the booklet is a must for all parents and I know it will help keep children safer."
Councillor Paul Clein, Liverpool Council executive member for children's services, said: "I hope this booklet will offer some ideas and information for parents to help them find their way through the maze of issues that they may have to deal with. "I hope it will make parenting a less stressful and more rewarding experience."
The booklet has been produced by the Liverpool Children and Young People's Partnership, a group of organisations including the city council who safeguard and promote the well-being of children. It will be distributed to parents through schools, hospitals and libraries.
