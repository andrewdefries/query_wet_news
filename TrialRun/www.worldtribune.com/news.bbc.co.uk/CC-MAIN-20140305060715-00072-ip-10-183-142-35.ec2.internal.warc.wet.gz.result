'Hitler skull' revealed as female
Scientists said the bone fragment was too thin to be from an adult male
A bone fragment believed to be part of Adolf Hitler's skull has been revealed as being that of an unidentified woman, US scientists have said.The section of bone - marked with a bullet hole - was used to support the theory that Hitler shot himself. Russian scientists said the skull piece was found alongside Hitler's jawbone and had put it on display in Moscow. But US scientists said DNA tests revealed it actually belonged to a woman aged between 20 and 40. An archaeologist from the University of Connecticut travelled to Moscow, where the fragment has been on show in the city's federal archive since 2000, to take a sample. Cyanide pillNick Bellantoni said he had suspected even before the bone was tested that the fragment did not come from an adult male. "The bone was very small and thin, and normally male bones are much more robust in our species," he said. "I thought it probably came from a woman or a younger man." DNA tests confirmed that the bone fragment came from a female. Doubts about exactly how Hitler died have persisted for decades. Russian officials said that the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun - who reportedly committed suicide in a Berlin bunker in 1945 - were removed from a shell crater shortly after they died. The piece of skull forms part of a collection that also includes a section of a bloodstained sofa where Hitler is believed to have shot himself after swallowing a cyanide pill.

Piltdown's lessons for modern science
By Professor Chris Stringer
Natural History Museum
A new book reveals how recent research has uncovered a goldmine of information about the history of human habitation in Britain.
The Piltdown skull fooled scientists for more than 40 years
Here, Homo britannicus author Chris Stringer describes how efforts to search for evidence of early Britons were hampered by wrong turns and false leads, including the granddaddy of all scientific forgeries.
In the early years of the 20th Century, British archaeologists were becoming increasingly desperate for a human fossil to show that our island had deep prehistoric roots.
Our greatest rival, Germany, had the Heidelberg jaw and the original Neanderthal bones. France had Neanderthal fossils and early modern humans at Cro-Magnon to complement their beautiful cave art. Even the Dutch had Java Man, which they had brought back from the Dutch East Indies. Stone handaxes had been found in Britain, so it was clear that early people had lived here. Some scientists also believed in more primitive stone tools called eoliths, though we now know these were often no more than naturally broken rocks. The absence of a single significant human fossil from Britain was conspicuous. The time was right for the appearance of Piltdown Man: the earliest Englishman with the earliest cricket bat. Not cricket
Charles Dawson, a British solicitor and amateur fossil hunter, claimed that some time before 1910, a workman had handed him a thick, dark-stained piece of human skull that had been found in gravels at the village of Piltdown in Sussex. The "cricket bat" would have threatened Dawson's plans
By 1912, Dawson had found more of the skull, and had contacted his friend Arthur Smith Woodward, the keeper of geology at the British Museum (now the Natural History Museum, where I work). Together, they excavated the Piltdown site, where they discovered more skull fragments, fossil animal bones, stone tools and a remarkable lower jaw.
Additional finds, including a bizarre elephant bone implement shaped like a cricket bat, helped swing the opinions of British sceptics in favour of the discovery. But Piltdown's days were numbered. Discoveries of possible human ancestors in Africa and Asia in the 1920s and 1930s pushed Piltdown into an increasingly peripheral position.
Part of the cleverness of the hoax was the way in which it suited preconceived ideas about what early humans should look like
Finally, in 1953, stringent scientific tests were applied, exposing the lower jaw as a forgery. Later analyses would show the whole assemblage of bones and fossils at Piltdown had been planted. The human skull was that of a modern person, the jaw from an orang-utan. Both had been artificially stained to match the gravels.
Charles Dawson remains the prime suspect. He was the first person to seriously search for and report fossils at the site and was present when all the major finds were made.
He is now linked with several suspected forgeries, most of which were "missing links" between previously known stages in either evolution or technology.
Sent off course
Dawson was daring to a point, but he took things one step at a time. For example, he waited until experts predicted what size Piltdown Man's canine would be and, lo and behold, the next year a canine turned up of just the right size.
The time was right for an early Englishman to emerge
However, I don't think Dawson would have done something as grotesque and outrageous as the "cricket bat", as it would have threatened the entire story he was trying to construct. Martin Hinton, a volunteer in Smith Woodward's department at the British Museum and later the Keeper of Zoology, had the means and motive to create this object.
In the 1970s, a canvas trunk bearing the initials MH was found in loft space above the old Keeper of Zoology's office. Inside were mammal teeth and bones carved in the style of the Piltdown material. We also know from letters that Hinton was aware the Piltdown finds were suspect. I think he made and planted this absurd object to warn the forgers that the game was up - only to find it hailed as one of the earliest known bone implements.
PILTDOWN MAN IN TIME
1912 - Discoveries publicised
1914 - 'Cricket bat' surfaces
1915 - Charles Dawson dies
1949 - Piltdown ages queried
1953 - Fossil fakes unmasked
Piltdown was particularly damaging for us in Britain, because British scientists clung to it for far longer than they should have done. It clouded their judgment and affected their interpretations of genuine fossils. For example, when australopithecine fossils started to turn up in South Africa during the 1920s, prominent British-based anatomists like Sir Arthur Keith and Grafton Elliot Smith wouldn't take them seriously because they believed in Piltdown Man.
Lessons learnt
Part of the cleverness of the hoax was the way in which it suited preconceived ideas about what early humans should look like. Keith and Grafton Elliot Smith thought a large brain was such an important part of humans today that it must have a long and deep evolutionary history. Piltdown had a high, domed skull with a large brain, confirming their belief in the antiquity of these features in the human lineage.
Stone tools from Pakefield in Suffolk are 700,000 years old
In other countries, Piltdown was viewed with more caution if not downright suspicion. The scientist Franz Weidenreich, who fled Nazi Germany to work in the US during the 1930s, had seen what a potential human ancestor could look like after working on the Peking Man fossils from China. Of course, they looked nothing like Piltdown Man.	He said of Piltdown: "The sooner the chimaera 'Eoanthropus' is erased from the list of human fossils, the better for science."	Weidenreich didn't have an explanation for it and he couldn't say outright that it was a fake; but he knew there was something seriously wrong with it. In other countries, Piltdown was viewed with more caution if not downright suspicion
Hopefully, the Piltdown saga has taught those of us who study the evolution of humans some important lessons that we should apply today. Firstly, we mustn't let preconceived ideas run away with us. Secondly, specimens have to pass certain basic tests.	Science thrives on scepticism, which is why the extraordinary discovery of the "Hobbit" fossils in Indonesia has prompted a lively scientific debate over its status. Science is also self-correcting. In Britain, during the first half of the 20th Century, people simply shut their minds to other evidence and continued to believe in Piltdown because it fitted their beliefs and was the only significant human fossil we had. Further work
We now have genuine human fossils to speak of from Britain, including a shinbone and teeth from Boxgrove dating to about 500,000 years ago and part of the skull of an early Neanderthal that was unearthed at Swanscombe in Kent.	The discovery of the "Hobbit" fossils has prompted a lively debate
The first phase of our Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) project has pushed back the evidence of humans in Britain by 200,000 years. We have also shown that humans tried to settle in Britain at least eight times, but on seven of those occasions they subsequently perished as Britain was hit by successive ice advances.
In the second phase of AHOB, due to last until 2010, we plan to uncover further details about these ancient colonisations.	Piltdown Man is now on show once again, at an exhibition in Bonn, Germany, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the original Neanderthal fossil. It still gets a lot of attention, because it is, as much as anything, a whodunit story. Once proudly held up as the earliest known Englishman, Piltdown is now displayed as a lesson from the past, of a prehistory of Britain and a stage of human evolution that never was.
Homo britannicus is published by Penguin Books. Chris Stringer is Research Leader in Human Origins at the Natural History Museum in London. He is also director of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) project.

Airport worker jailed over theft
Cameras at the airport filmed Vasconelos going through luggage
A Gatwick Airport security guard who stole from passengers' luggage after screening bags for items he wanted to take has been jailed for 18 months.
Portuguese Jose Vasconelos, 34, of Borage Close, Crawley, was arrested in March following a year-long operation to halt thefts by airport staff. Surveillance cameras were installed to monitor staff and Vasconelos was seen going through luggage on 13 occasions.
He was jailed after admitting seven charges of theft at Lewes Crown Court.
X-ray machine
The father-of-three initially denied theft but when police searched his home they found about 80 stolen items, including a Cartier watch worth �2,500.
Filmed surveillance showed how he selected items to steal as luggage passed through an X-ray machine used to screen bags.
Vasconelos, who asked for a further 35 counts of theft and attempted theft to be taken into account, is believed to have stolen at least �7,000 worth of goods.
The crackdown by Sussex Police, airport operator BAA and British Airways involved more than 100 police officers and resulted in several arrests.
Sentencing Vasconelos, Judge Richard Hayward said: "You were in a position of considerable trust and responsibility, and I am afraid you abused that trust."

Vote For Yourself manifesto
George Weiss said party wanted to remove cash from circulation
Belfast should be closed down for a year for redecoration and to implement successful architectural designs decided by its citizens, according to a party manifesto.
The Vote For Yourself Party said it would invite designs for a new "Wonder City" from locally based artists and architects.
The party is fielding three candidates in the 26 November Northern Ireland Assembly election - in three of the four Belfast constituencies.
Party leader George Weiss, also known as Rainbow George, said: "I am astonished at how many people have disappeared from the electoral register.
"People are so disillusioned and so dissatisfied with the party political system."
In terms of what government system should operate in Northern Ireland, he said: "People would elect an executive, but that executive would be there to carry out the wishes of the people.
"This would effectively be government by referendum - we call it preferendum.
"It is power to the people - we need a future where people vote for policies and not for politicians."
The main points of the party manifesto include: People receiving all basic services for free, with no charges for gas, water, electricity, telephones, public transport, healthcare, education and accommodation
Declaring all debts null and void
Removing cash from circulation, and introducing an electronic city currency called "The Wonder"
Allocating land and facilities for co-operative projects.

Labour MPs back hunting ban move
MPs have already voted to ban hunting with dogs
The government's decision to use the Parliament Act, if necessary, to force into law a ban on hunting with dogs, has won the backing of Labour MPs.
The support was signalled at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, attended by Rural Affairs Minister Alun Michael.
A motion was carried at the meeting applauding the government's decision to use the Parliament Act if need be.
Gordon Prentice, anti-hunting Labour MP for Pendle, said he was relieved the government had finally made up its mind "after years of faffing around".
Rare move
MPs have already voted to outlaw hunting with dogs, although their colleagues in the Lords back the option of licensed hunting.
Alun Michael MP: Pledged to make "good law"
The government has said it will consult for six months before going ahead with new legislation on the issue. Mr Prentice said he doubted that the new round of consultation on hunting would "tell us anything we didn't know already".
Use of the Parliament Act is rare and allows the government to force Bills into law despite opposition from the House of Lords.
The government used the procedure recently to push through a Bill lowering the gay age of consent to 16 after peers rejected the measure.
Mr Michael said in Parliament last month he wanted to "engage with everyone who has an interest in this issue (hunting) to make the legislation
practical and robust".
He pledged to introduce a Bill which would deal with hunting "effectively once and for all and make good law".
The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance announced this week it is to hold a massive protest march through London on Sunday 22 September - a week prior to the start of
the Labour Party annual conference.
