Summit talks for Obama in Beijing
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Barack Obama has held a summit in Beijing with Chinese leader Hu Jintao, as he continues his first tour of Asia as US president.Mr Obama was given an official welcome in the Great Hall of the People, or parliament, before going for talks with the Chinese president. Trade, climate change and economic issues are expected to dominate. The two men have already met during the visit, having dinner together on Monday in the Chinese capital. Before Tuesday's closed-door meeting began, Mr Obama said: "We believe strong dialogue is important not only for the US and China, but for the rest of the world." Mr Hu said: "I look forward to having an in-depth relationship." OBAMA ASIA TOUR

What can Obama achieve in China?
Later in the day, Mr Obama is due to meet the chairman of the parliament, Wu Banguo, and there will be a state banquet at the Great Hall. The US leader, who is not being accompanied by his family on the tour, is also fitting in visits to the Forbidden City and the American embassy. He arrived by plane in the capital from Shanghai where he had addressed Chinese students, telling them that individual rights and freedoms should be available to all. Mr Obama had told his audience that he was a "big supporter of non-censorship", and that unrestricted internet access was a "source of strength" that should be encouraged. Communist China employs some of the tightest controls over internet content in the world. Greeting his American guest in Beijing on Monday, President Hu noted Mr Obama's meeting with the students, calling it "quite lively". Mr Obama smiled broadly as his host spoke, then told Mr Hu that the world recognised "the importance of the US-Chinese relationship" in tackling global problems. During the two leaders' dinner, conversation centred upon the respective histories of the two countries, and both men outlined the economic challenges their states face. They swapped ideas about the significance education plays in the advancement of their people, the Associated Press news agency reports. Mr Obama visited Japan and Singapore earlier and is scheduled to fly to South Korea after leaving China on Wednesday.

'Rasputin' row hits Lithuanian leader
Paksas says relations with Lolisvili are purely personal
Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas has rejected criticism of his links with a faith healer who allegedly employs bizarre methods such as wrapping people in toilet paper.
Mr Paksas said in a statement his relations with mystic Lena Lolisvili were personal and that she had no influence on state affairs.
Local media have described Ms Lolisvili as a Lithuanian Rasputin, after the Siberian monk who wielded power behind the scenes at the Russian imperial court at the beginning of the last century.
Correspondents say reports about Ms Lolisvili have caused uproar in the mainly Roman Catholic country, which is sensitive about its image as it prepares for Nato and EU membership.
'Laughing-stock'
Mr Paksas, a former stunt pilot who won a surprise victory in January's presidential election, says Ms Jolisvili gave him the will to live when he was seriously ill and facing a major operation.
It is time for the president to realise he is no longer a pilot flying under bridges but the leader of a democratic state
Lietuvos Rytas newspaper
She is also thought to have predicted in 1996 that he would win the presidency, and was a guest of honour at his inauguration.
But the Lithuanian press has hinted that the mystic has a more sinister role.
The daily Lietuvos Rytas said that candidates for official posts had to meet Ms Lolisvili before they were appointed. "Lithuania risks becoming the laughing-stock of the world for the next five years," the newspaper said. "It is time for the president to realise he is no longer a pilot flying under bridges but the leader of a democratic state."
Paksas was elected in January
Cardinal Audrys Backis, the head of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Church, last week described Ms Lolisvili as a "false prophet" and a "wolf in sheep's clothing".
Conservative MP Jurgis Razma said: "The emerging facts about the influence of this lady are less and less surprising, especially if one has read the history of Russian Tsar Nicholas II and the influence of Rasputin at that time."
Links
Mr Paksas rejected the charges.
"The new interpretations placed on our meetings and relations have reached the point where not only the presidential institution but the Lithuanian state is being discredited," he said.
Ms Jolisvili, an ethnic Georgian, has claimed that God tells her the future, and is said to energise toilet paper before wrapping it around her patients.
She has also said she has links to Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas, who is himself a former president, and other top officials.

Legacy of the 'Miracle of Berne'
By Paul Legg
BBC News
The tournament was the first to be broadcast live on TV in Europe
For the Germans, knowing the impact of the World Cup goes far beyond football is a lesson they have understood since a rainy day in the Wankdorf Stadium in Berne, Switzerland, in the summer of 1954.
An unheralded West German team, first timers in the tournament, caused the biggest sensation in world sport since World War II by defeating the apparently invincible Hungarians to win the trophy.
The victory led to an unprecedented outpouring of joy, not just in West but in East Germany too, as millions took to the streets to celebrate a "positive" German achievement.
The celebrations were encapsulated in the phrase "Wir Sind Wieder Wer" ("We are somebody again") as they gave enormous psychological impetus to the building of the West German state.
Televisions sell out
The success of the West German team played an undeniable role in stimulating the economic growth, already beginning to transform the face of the country.
Victory had a great psychological impact in post-war Germany
In particular, the success of the team gave a huge boost to the West German media industry. The tournament was the first to be broadcast live on television in Europe.
At the start of the tournament, few Germans had TV sets but, by the end, the factories and shops had completely sold out.
At the start of 1954, there were 11,000 television owners in West Germany, but by the end of the year there were 84,000.
Television manufacturers were quick to capitalise on the connection with football, presenting each of the German players with a gift of a set in highly publicised ceremonies.
Other manufacturers were equally alive to the commercial advantages of being associated with the huge positive publicity surrounding the team.
Adidas takes off
The players were showered with extravagant gifts at every stage of their drawn-out homecoming: with the televisions came radios, washing-machines, fridges and sewing-machines (the latter for the loyal spouses who had supported from the Home Front).
Nothing can stop these unlovable people
Daily Mirror, 1954
Among the players, the most popular gift was a new motorbike.
This was still a time when cars were too expensive for most Germans but the motorbike industry was booming: 60,000 bikes were delivered to German homes between 1951 and 1955.
The best example of this commercial "exploitation" of the World Cup victory came from within the West German camp itself.
The shoe manufacturer "Adi" Dassler had been a key member of the team's backroom staff: his invention of the "removable stud" playing a largely unheralded role in the final victory.
Within days of the victory in Berne, Dassler's company, Adidas, was advertising "the boot which won the World Cup" in German sports magazines.
Controversial comments
In the same way as Franz Beckenbauer and Co are very conscious of the impact a successful tournament in 2006 will have on the image of Germany today, so in 1954 politicians and media commentators were concerned at the negative effect any excessive celebrations could have on world opinion.
The West German team was showered with gifts after the victory
The singing of the banned first verse of the German national anthem by a small group of German supporters at the final whistle coupled with comments by the head of the German Football Association claiming that the Gods in Heaven had marched side by side with the team, provoked an immediate unwelcome reaction in parts of the foreign press.
As a result, one Danish newspaper reported that all that had been lacking at the end of the match was the "Sieg Heil" salute; in Milan, a sporting journal reported the West German victory under the headline: "Deutschland uber Alles".
In Britain, the Daily Mirror complained that "nothing can stop these unlovable people". And in France, Le Monde reported the German success under the headline: "Achtung."
The paper's columnist went on to remind readers that while winning a football tournament might in itself be innocent, the "innocent Weimar Republic" had "given birth to Hitler".
'Miracle of Berne'
This adverse publicity had some West German commentators - always prone to agonising at the best of times - wishing that the team had not won the 1954 World Cup after all!
But this was always a minority view and as the fuss died down about excessive celebrations, the benefits to West Germany of the victory became clear.
Some modern day historians call the football triumph a founding event in the birth of the West German state.
However the united German team performs in a few weeks' time and however well the tournament passes off, it will be hard pressed to have a greater impact inside Germany than that had by what became known as "Das Wunder von Bern" ("The Miracle of Berne"). E-mail this to a friend

Veterans' tribute to land commander
By Tom Geoghegan
BBC News Online in Normandy
Norman Akers lost a brother in the Normandy campaign
The ones who were too frail to march were wheeled along the streets of Colleville-Montgomery, but they made sure they were there.
Hundreds of British D-Day veterans took part, cheered on by thousands of friends, families and residents of the town.
The parade began at the seafront and made the short journey to the town's D-Day square, where a service was held under the watchful eye of their former leader, Field Marshal Montgomery.
His statue dominates the square in the town, which was re-named to mark the achievements of the commander-in-chief of the Allied land forces.
The mood was generally upbeat - as if the presence of so many veterans was itself something to celebrate.
Among the crowd there were England football shirts, Union Jacks being waved and a placard saying: "The young are grateful."
Field Marshal Bernard Law 'Monty' Montgomery
Born in 1887 - died 1976
Served on WW1 Western Front
Became Major General in 1938
Scored turning-point WW2 victory at El Alamein, N Africa
Commanded UK and Canadian units on D-Day
Became Field Marshal in 1944
Suffered defeat in Arnhem, Netherlands - 6,000 troops lost
Made Nato European Deputy Supreme Commander in 1951
One of the youngsters, Megan Singleton, eight, from Cumbria, said: "All the men fought for our freedom and we wouldn't be here if they hadn't done that." This gratitude was shared by some of the French observers.
Gerard Davesne, 55, who lives in the town, said: "The service was very moving, for the veterans and for us. This is very important for the French people - all of them."
The cost of liberation was underlined by the Reverend Kenneth Ward, national chaplain of the Normandy Veterans' Association.
He read an extract from St John's Gospel, which said: "Man has no greater love than to lay down his life for his friend."
The Last Post was followed by a moment's silence for those killed in action or since passed away.
Norman Akers, 79, was thinking about his brother Ernest, killed in the Battle of Caen one month after D-Day.
In pictures: Tribute to Monty
Norman, himself a veteran, said: "My officer told me he had a letter from my parents which said they couldn't bring themselves to inform me. Ernie was my icon and I'm thinking of him today."
Walter Brooks, 84, dabbing his eyes, told me: "The ceremony was perfect, but very emotional."
He served under Montgomery in the desert and in France and said he was a great leader who gave the troops great confidence.
But for serving members of the Armed Forces, marshalling events in Colleville-Montgomery, it was clear who their inspiration was.
Major Nigel Partington of the 4JS Medical Regiment said: "When we go to war now, we are governed by technology and not the raw courage shown by these men.
"Not the raw courage of facing fortified positions knowing your life expectancy is about 5%." E-mail this to a friend

UKIP seeks more Euro seats
Analysis
By Nick Assinder
BBC News Online political correspondent
It is always a boost for political parties to be able to trot out some celebs at election time.
Kilroy-Silk is standing in the East Midlands
And the small but high-profile UK Independence Party can certainly claim its fair share of those.
Most recently it has lined up controversial TV presenter Robert Kilroy-Silk - the man who probably pioneered daytime audience participation shows in Britain - as a candidate for the European parliament elections.
Publicist Max Clifford and Dick Morris, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton are also on board.
So that should help ensure the party gets voters' attention.
And it is probably fair to say that the party's demand for the UK to pull out of the EU strikes a chord with a large number of British voters.
PR system
Whether all this celebrity and policy can be translated into votes, let alone seats in the European elections on 10 June, is another matter.
It is always difficult for smaller parties to make the breakthrough in British politics, thanks to the nature of the first-past-the-post system.
UKIP hopes to win 10 Euro seats
Things are better for them in Europe because the election is carried out under a PR system.
Last time around that helped it secure three of the 84 British seats and, things being equal, party leaders could well have expected to improve on that showing on 10 June.
And, speaking at the launch of the party's campaign, leader Roger Knapman called for voters to make 10 June "Independence Day" by handing him 10 or more seats.
War vote
The apparent rise in Euroscepticism amongst voters should play to their advantage, as might the government's U turn over a referendum on the EU constitution.
That change of heart by Tony Blair may have effectively neutralised the referendum argument as an election issue, but it also ensured it was put in the front of voters' minds.
The downside for the party, however, is the effect of enlargement of the EU which has meant nine fewer seats to share out in the UK.
There is also the question of whether the EU poll will really turn into a vote on Tony Blair's role in the war on Iraq - as the Liberal Democrats are urging.
And whether the public Euroscepticism actually suggests there is a widespread desire to withdraw from the EU and renegotiate terms is an open question.
Either way, at a time when the party may reasonably expect to improve its showing, it may find it has a fight on its hands.

The phone you dial on your hand
The gadget without buttons
If you're sick of carrying your phone around with you, scientists could have come up with a solution: a phone that you dial on your arm!It sounds crazy but the experts at Skinput have invented a gadget that projects your phone's numbers onto your skin. To make a call you just dial the numbers where they appear on your arm - and the 'phone' will call your friends! The device is still being developed and won't be in the shops for a while. Have a go at our daily quiz
At the moment you have to carry a projector with you for the device to work. The projector is strapped to your arm, and projects a keypad on your skin. When you touch a key, the movement is picked up by a sensor in the projector which sends a message to the gadget telling it what to do. Watch clips

El Guerrouj is set to retire at the end of 2006
Double Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj is out of next month's World Championships in Helsinki.
The 31-year-old four-time world champion picked up a virus in May. And the Moroccan, who won the 1500m and 5,000m in Athens last year and has not raced since, told French newspaper L'Equipe he was taking the season off. El Guerrouj said: "No, I will not race [this season]. It was not an easy decision to take. I took my decision one month ago."
El Guerrouj said a never-ending series of public appearances after his Athens triumph had taken its toll.
I've got nothing to prove. Everything I do next year will be a bonus
Hicham El Guerrouj
He plans to resume training in August and run again in 2006 before hanging up his spikes.
"I've got nothing to prove. Everything I do next year will be a bonus," he said.
He named Portugal's Olympic bronze medallist Rui Silva as his favourite to succeed him in Helsinki.
But he also believes Ukraine's Ivan Heshko and Kenya's Komen Kipchirchir are in the running for the world title.
El Guerrouj won the 1500m world title in 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003. He was silver medallist in 1995 and also won the 5,000m silver medal in 2003.
His 3min 26sec run in 1998 still stands as the 1500m world record.

McDowell shows stroke of genius
By Thomas McGuigan
Graeme McDowell is co-leader at the Scottish Open
The Scottish Open doesn't have the necessary appeal to attract all of the world's top golfers ahead of The Open at Royal Birkdale, so the critics say.
But, only defending Open champion Padraig Harrington and injured pair Tiger Woods and Luke Donald are missing from Loch Lomond this week. Woods, recovering from a knee injury, doesn't like to play the course ahead of The Open.
With Loch Lomond not being a links, Harrington has decided to remain in Ireland ahead of defending his Open title.
Neverthless, all the other big-hitters are here. Ernie Els, Phil Mickleson, Lee Westwood, Adam Scott and Henrik Stenson to name but a few.
The attendance figures also suggest the fans are happy to visit Loch Lomond, despite it being a Tiger-free zone and a midge's paradise.
Last year, 18,104 spectators came through the gates for second round of the Scottish Open. This year, that figure rose to 19,876 - higher than any of the previous four years, according to Scottish Open statistics.
Michael Sweeney, a marshal at this year's Scottish Open for the 10th time, believes the event at Loch Lomond is going from strength to strength.
"The American players in particular need this tournament to sharpen their game," Sweeney said. "Maybe the Europeans, and champions like Harrington, don't need that as much because they're used to these types of courses.
"But a number of winners here over the years have performed strongly at The Open or gone on to win it."
Mingling with the spectators, there's certainly an international flavour at Loch Lomond.
For every Scottish voice noticeably discussing the merits of an iron off the tee or Paul Lawrie's short game, a Spanish or American opinion can be heard nearby.
Paul Lawrie gave the home spectators some cheer
Malcolm Langlands and Donald MacDonald, from Edinburgh and Helensburgh respectively, have been monitoring the progress of Miguel Angel Jiminez. The affable Spaniard attracted a sizeable gallery during his third round with partner, Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell.
Langlands and MacDonald sported See You Jimmy hats, fashioned in the style of Jiminez's shock of red curly hair, much to the amusement of the rest of the crowd.
"He's a great player and a great personality," Langlands told BBC Sport. "We met him in Doha and decided to wear the hats when we see him play. He acknowledged us this morning and we hope he does well."
Indeed, Jiminez is a crowd-pleaser. Easing himself round the course like a retired Marine general, at complete ease with his surroundings and lot-in-life.
Gerry Knox enjoyed his first experience of the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond. His son bought him a ticket for the third round as a birthday present and he was preparing to return home on Sunday.
"I've enjoyed watching the Scottish Open on television," he told BBC Sport. "But to be honest, the TV doesn't do it justice," the 71-year-old added.
Northern Ireland's McDowell is tied for the lead with England's Simon Khan on 10 under par after posting the day's best score of 66.
Scotland's Paul Lawrie finished the day on 6 under par after a 72.
Looking ahead to The Open at Royal Birkdale, McDowell said he hoped his background of being a strong links player would stand him in good stead.
"I played Birkdale recently and I think that links golf is something you grow up with, it's in your blood. Hopefully, I can use that to good effect next week."
Judging by the passion of the spectators at Loch Lomond, golf is in the blood here, too. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?
