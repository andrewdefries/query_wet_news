Peru's president appoints new PM
By Dan Collyns
BBC News, Lima
President Garcia's popularity is at its lowest level since he took office
Peru's President Alan Garcia has appointed a leftist regional governor, Yehude Simon, as his prime minister.
Mr Garcia's choice appears to be a move intended to regain public trust after Friday's resignation of his entire cabinet over an oil corruption scandal.
It also seems intended to neutralise leftist critics of Mr Garcia - whose popularity has dropped to a new low.
But the choice of Mr Simon, who served time in jail for alleged links to left-wing rebels, has shocked many.
He had been under tremendous pressure to shake up his cabinet after audio tapes leaked to the media implicated members of the governing Apra party in bribe-taking for rigging multi-million dollar oil contracts.
Former Prime Minister Jorge del Castillo was mentioned in two of the tapes.
He denied any wrongdoing, but his position became untenable after protests from the opposition and general public.
Corruption complaints
The new prime minister, 61, said he wanted to build an alliance between the left and the government.
"I want to build a great alliance, friendship between sectors of the left and the government," Reuters reported him as telling Peruvian radio. Former PM Jorge del Castillo (L) was mentioned in two of the tapes
"I have no doubt that businessmen of the so-called right will also draw near. The country needs a truce."
A popular regional governor of the northern province of Lambayeque, Mr Simon has a reputation for transparency and for improving healthcare and education standards.
He was pardoned after serving eight years in prison in the 1990s on suspicion of belonging to the Tupac Amaru revolutionary movement.
The movement was the smaller of two rebel groups which wreaked havoc in Peru for two decades.
Critics say booming economic growth has failed to ease poverty for millions of Peruvians, while polls say corruption is the public's top complaint.
Midway through his term as president, Mr Garcia's popularity is at its lowest level since he took office, especially outside the capital Lima.
Mr Simon's appointment may just be the radical step needed to restore the government's reputation.

Internet workers feel dot.carnage
by BBC News Online's David Schepp
For a year or two it was a one-way street. Journalists and other media types fed up with stuffy traditional media galloped away in droves to sign up with the latest dot.com start-ups.
Now many are making a mad dash back - in search of job security, established management practices and in many cases a pay cheque.
But traditional media outlets have felt their fair share of internet hurt, too. Failure to draw substantive advertising revenue to their own web pages has caused them to pull back and in some cases pull the plug.
Go.com gets gone
Walt Disney's exit from its internet venture on Tuesday is perhaps the most celebrated failure of a media-related web site to pull in users and produce profits for investors.
Disney said it will cut 400 jobs and axe its Go.com leisure portal following concerns about the operation's ability to reach profitability. Investors in the Disney Internet Group (DIG), which has its own New York Stock Exchange listing, will instead get shares of the parent company.
The Go.com site lost money ever since its launch two years ago - not unlike the mother of all "e-tailers", Amazon.com. The firm said on Tuesday it would cut 1,300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, as the online retailer tries to inch closer to profitability. Good, grey and gone
The New York Times is another prescient example of a traditional media company who entered the internet fray only to beat a retreat.
The celebrated "Good Gray Times" shook off its stodgy image in the '90s, introducing colour photos to its print edition and embracing the web in several forms, including a site specifically targeted at high-tech news, called CyberTimes, and its local entertainment guide, newyorktoday.com.
Also part of its expansion into cyberspace was a stake in promising business-news player TheStreet.com. As part of its investment in the upstart, the Times established a joint newsroom and hired extra staff.
New York's revitalized Times Square is host to many dot.coms
But in November, the joint newsroom was disbanded, and in early January the New York Times pulled out completely, selling its TheStreet.com shares with a "very small loss". On top of that, New York Times Digital, which produces the Times internet pages, said it was laying off 69 employees.
Sayonara CNN
Earlier this month AOL Time Warner's Cable News Network (CNN) unit said it planned to lay off 400 people or 10% of its work force. About a third of the cuts are coming from CNN's online staff.
Also in January, News Corp's News Digital Media was shut, axing 200 out of 450 jobs, while NBCi, the internet arm of General Electric's NBC unit, said it would lay off another 150 people following a similarly sized reduction in August.
All told the dot.com carnage has resulted in the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs in media-related operations, ranging from political and social commentary cyber mag Salon.com to DrDrew.com, an online disseminator of love and sex advice for teenagers and young adults.
What the future holds for the myriad remaining news sites has yet to be seen. But the day's of unbridled enthusiasm for cyber journalism has seen its day and may never be repeated again.

Tough times at Harry Potter firm
The seventh and final Potter book is due out in July
Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury saw its annual profits drop 74% in 2006, a year in which there was no new book in the best-selling fantasy novel series.
Reporting its 2006 results, its pre-tax profit dropped to �5.2m from �20.1m in 2005, when the most recent book about the teenage wizard was released.
The results were not a surprise as Bloomsbury warned in December that its full-year profits would be down.
The seventh and final Harry Potter book is set for release in July this year.
'Growth strategy'
Bloomsbury chairman Nigel Newton said 2006 was "a challenging year".
Its turnover for the year fell 32% to �74.8m from �109.1m in 2005.
Mr Newton said the firm now had a growth strategy in place that included developing new authors, internet-based initiatives, and acquisitions, "all of which we believe will enhance and strengthen our position as a leading publisher".
The global success of the Harry Potter books has generated bumper profits for Bloomsbury, but the company is now under pressure to find new hit publications as the Potter series draws to a close.
In previous years without a new Harry Potter release, the company has been able to continue to raise profits, thanks mainly to follow-up paperback sales or the books' global roll-out.
However, it now appears that these have both reached saturation point and that anyone who wants a current Harry Potter book has already got one.

Lung patients unaware of flight dangers
People with lung problems may be putting themselves in danger
Patients with serious respiratory problems are travelling by air without realising that they are putting their lives at risk, say chest specialists.
They are urging anyone with breathing problems to get in touch with a doctor before stepping on a plane.
Although aircraft cabins are pressurised, it is only to about two-thirds normal atmospheric pressure - the equivalent of standing on a 7,000 foot tall mountain.
And people with lung conditions such as emphysema, severe bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who have difficulty getting enough oxygen at sea level, can worsen and dangerously lower the oxygen level in their blood.
Cabin pressures are much lower than at sea levelConsultant chest physician Dr Owen Johnson, a member of the British Thoracic Society, says there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that patients are unwittingly placing themselves at serious risk.
He said: "I have heard of many cases where people have needed oxygen on flights after getting into difficulty.
'Serious danger'
"A small number of patients are putting themselves in serious danger.
"I believe that people simply do not realise the potential problems caused by low cabin pressures."
He said that asthma patients, while at risk if experiencing a severe attack, should normally be able to cope.
The British Thoracic Society is currently developing guidelines for doctors on how respiratory patients should be tested for their fitness to fly.
Blood testing and 50 metre walks
The methods used by doctors vary widely - from simply asking patients to walk 50 metres and seeing if they become breathless, through blood testing of oxygen to placing them on a machine which mimics low atmospheric pressure to test their response.
Each airline has its own procedures to try and spot the passengers most at risk.
Virgin Atlantic has trained cabin door staff to recognise the tell-tale signs and call a doctor.
If contacted in advance, it offers a "special assistance" service to patients, involving extra oxygen supplies.
All airlines carry oxygen cylinders for use in emergencies.
Doctors, many of whom, as passengers, are called upon to help in a crisis, have expressed concern at the lack of lifesaving equipment aboard aircraft.
"Hospital Doctor" newspaper has been running a campaign calling for airlines to spend more on equipment, with the suggestion that heart defibrillators be available on long-haul flights.
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: "We would strongly advise anybody with a definite health problem to consult a doctor before they fly."

Microsoft Office to debut online
The web versions of Microsoft software are due to debut in 2009
Microsoft is preparing web versions of some of its most popular programs.
In 2009 web versions of Word, Excel and other programs in the Microsoft Office suite plus Exchange and Sharepoint will go online.
Users will be able to get at the programs via a web browser rather than install them on a PC.
Some versions of the programs are expected to be free to use provided users are happy to view adverts alongside the software.
"We expect fully that the full range of Office utilities, from the most advanced to simpler lightweight versions, will be available with a range of options: ad-funded, subscriptions-based, traditional licensing fees, and so forth," Stephen Elop, head of Microsoft's business division told the Reuters newswire.
The decision by Microsoft marks a significant change by the software giant which, before now, has only dabbled in web-based versions of its programs.
It has offered an ad-supported version of its Works suite that is available pre-loaded on some new PCs. By contrast many others, such as Google and Adobe, have been pushing web-based versions of word processors and other programs for some time.
The move to web-based versions is also seen as a belated move by Microsoft to bolster its credentials in the move to so-called "cloud computing" in which applications only live online. Microsoft pledged that the web-based versions would also work with rival browsers, such as Firefox, and would not require users to install its Silverlight software.
So far no date has been given for when the web-based versions will be available - though they are expected to be put online in 2009.
Mr Elop said Microsoft had seen strong interest from many existing customers in the web versions. Using such software would free many from maintaining their own hardware and software to support locally-installed versions.
The economic downturn and need to cut costs could boost the attractiveness of web-based software, said Mr Elop.
"What we think is in five years, 50% of the use of Exchange and Sharepoint could be serviced from the cloud," he said.

Man jailed over terror cell plans
Police said they were unsure who Altimimi really was
A man who stored up what police called a "vast library of terrorist material" has been jailed for nine years. Omar Altimimi, of Bolton, was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of six charges of possession of material for a purpose connected with terrorism.
Recorder of Manchester, Judge Maddison, said Altimimi, 37, was "a sleeper for some sort of terrorist organisation".
Passing sentence, he added: "It is not known when, if and how you might have been called upon to play your part."
Altimimi hoarded manuals on how to set up a terror cell and carry out bombings, and had identified night clubs and airports among "suitable targets".
He had denied all knowledge of the material found on his computer and had pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Judge Maddison added: "The offences, contrary to the Terrorism Act, are, in my view, of the most serious of their kind likely to come before the court.
"A person convicted of terrorist offences must expect a substantial sentence."
He was also convicted of two charges under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act.
Yusuf Abdullah, 30, was also sentenced on Friday and was given a three-year jail term for proceeds of crime offences. Police arrested Abdullah, also of Bolton, at the same time as Altimimi. He earlier pleaded guilty to acquiring $54,610 (�27,213) of criminal property. 'Range of identities'
During his four-week trial, the jury heard how Altimimi had arrived in the UK from the Netherlands in 2004.
Prosecutors said Altimimi created three identities and was collecting terror information on his computer.
He developed a range of identities, which would allow him to expand his terrorist activities. He is a congenital liar and has lied throughout this investigation
Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Porter
The jury convicted him of possessing files relating to an organisational chart for a terror cell, instructions on bomb detonators, instructions on making explosives, and details about chemical explosives and "bombing strategies".
The father-of-three was arrested last year on suspicion of money laundering when he tried to withdraw �3,000 believed to have been stolen from the Yemen Tourist Promotion Board.
The prosecution said the computer carrying terror-related files was recovered from Altimimi's home when it was raided seven weeks after his arrest. Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Porter, head of the Greater Manchester Police Counter Terrorism Unit, said Altimimi "developed a range of identities, which would allow him to expand his terrorist activities".
Altimimi used his wife and children to appear as an ordinary family man and blend into the community, he said. "But behind closed doors he was downloading shocking videos of executions, bomb-making recipes and information on how to establish a terrorist cell," Det Ch Spt Porter added. He added: "We will never know exactly what Altimimi was preparing to do but it was clear he had support and links with terrorists across the world."
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) revealed that when Altimimi's two computers were seized other material found included a job description for a role with GMP police and application forms for Bolton Council and for a teacher training position.

Budget row stokes election fever
Portillo and Brown square up as election nears
Spending on schools and hospitals has become the main battleground between Labour and the Conservatives - a day after what was generally accepted to be a pre-election Budget. Chancellor Gordon Brown says his plans for an extra �2bn for health and education over three years makes it more urgent for the Tories to explain how they will make cuts to fund tax reductions. The Tories must cut Labour's spending plans by �16bn
Alistair Darling
Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo responded by saying he will match the announcements in the Budget and still cut taxes. "Labour's spin is absolutely different from the reality, as it always is. It isn't extra money, and therefore there is no problem in matching it," he said. Spending 'affordable'
But Social Security secretary Alistair Darling said later that the additional funds for schools and hospitals were affordable because of unexpected savings on social security and debt interest payments.
"The Budget plans mean that spending will now grow by 3.7% a year over the next three years," he said. "The Tories' spending rule, their only spending rule, is that spending should grow by 2.25% a year or less.
Portillo derided Labour's tax cuts
"This is the rock on which they stand. If they grow spending at 2.25% a year, they must cut Labour's spending plans by more than �16bn over three years or �10bn over two years." Mr Darling also accused Mr Portillo of being inconsistent in claiming he would match Labour plans, but also insisting he would stick to lower spending growth.
"He either has a rule or he doesn't. There are two Portillos about," said Mr Darling.
Petrol Cuts
At his own post-Budget briefing Mr Portillo accused the chancellor of "triple counting" the �1bn he said would be invested in the NHS over the next three years, saying the true figure was �290m.
"It is neither here nor there," he said. Mr Portillo insisted the Tories would stick to their plans to cut public spending by �8bn, while matching Labour's expenditure on vital public services, to fund tax cuts.
He also confirmed a future Tory Government would cut petrol by at least 3p a litre even after Mr Brown's Budget measures. In Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor announced around �3.6bn in tax cuts - �2bn of which went to motorists and which had already been foreshadowed in November's pre-Budget report.
He also confirmed �1.6bn for pensioners which had been pre-announced in the autumn.

The Budget's warm reception from many of the national newspapers has added to the pressure on Tony Blair to call a spring general election. The Sun newspaper, a stalwart supporter of the Tories throughout the Thatcher years, declared it was backing Labour for a second term. But former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind denied that this was a fatal blow for his party. He told the BBC that the newspaper's policy had been decided by its owner, Rupert Murdoch.
"He takes a judgement as to what suits his own views. He's perfectly entitled to his opinion, but the country is not governed by The Sun and it is not The Sun that decides elections," said Sir Malcolm. Earlier, Mr Brown insisted Labour was not complacent about the outcome of the election, saying it should never take anything for granted.
Money 'misused'
For the Liberal Democrats, Malcolm Bruce attacked the Budget as a missed opportunity.
"We need to do a great deal more if we are going to get the nurses, the doctors and the boost to pensions that we need."
He said that Mr Brown had the money but was not using it in the right way.
"It is a pre-election Budget when what was needed was an investment Budget," he argued.

Boston lose Football League spot
Wrexham 3-1 Boston United
Valentine coolly slotted the crucial Wrexham penalty
A second-half fightback secured Wrexham's Football League status but Boston were condemned to the drop.
Boston, who lost 3-1, entered into a Company Voluntary Arrangement before the game but it has yet to be confirmed if they have been deducted 10 points.
Francis Green gave Boston the lead but Drewe Broughton fouled Danny Williams and Ryan Valentine scored the penalty.
Paul Ellender went close for Boston, but in the last minutes Chris Llewellyn and Mike Proctor won it for Wrexham.
A win for Boston would have kept them in the League but their dreams were ended when Llewellyn latched on to a delightful 87th-minute through-ball from the outstanding Mark Jones, got the ball on to his left foot and smashed it back across Andy Marriott to give the Dragons the lead.
On-loan Hartlepool striker Proctor completed the coup de grace with a header after good work from substitute Lee McEvilly.
606: DEBATE
Give your reaction to Boston United's relegation
The Pilgrims' directors, knowing relegation was all but certain in the closing stages of the match, swiftly entered the club into a Company Voluntary Arrangement [CVA] before the game had ended.
The financial rescue package is similar to administration and will safeguard the club's future.
Boston chief executive Barrie Pierpoint said: "We have entered into a CVA to keep the club alive and, with myself and chairman Jim Rodwell working on new marketing and commercial strategies, we are looking at getting Boston clear of debt in a couple of years."
Boston, who have been kicked out of their own training facilities and forced to travel to away games in cars, were backed by 450 travelling supporters.
But the result ends the Pilgrims' five-year stay in the Football League and extends the membership of Wrexham into an 87th season.
Wrexham: Anthony Williams, Spender, Pejic, Steve Evans, Valentine, Llewellyn, Mark Jones, Danny Williams, Done, Roberts (McEvilly 85), Proctor.Subs Not Used: Michael Jones, Roche, Mike Williams, Mackin.
Booked: Valentine, Llewellyn.
