Somali factions sign truce deal
Somalia has been plagued by anarchy and fighting
Warring factions and the transitional government (TNG) in Somalia have signed a ceasefire deal aimed at bringing more than a decade of fighting and anarchy to an end, foreign mediators have said.
Twenty-one rival groups and the TNG agreed to end hostilities for the duration of current peace talks and to pave the way for a new federal system of government.
Rays of hope on the prospects of peace in Somalia are now more evident than ever before
Elijah MwangaleKenyan mediator But correspondents say the agreement is unlikely to win support from the breakaway northern region of Somaliland, and neither has it been signed by the faction which controls regions in central Somalia.
The peace talks have the backing of the international community, which has threatened to impose sanctions on groups opposing an agreement.
The talks, in the north-western Kenyan town of Eldoret, are the latest in more than a dozen failed attempts to restore peace to Somalia since the overthrow of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre in January, 1991.
Hopes for peace
Chief Kenyan mediator Elijah Mwangale said the agreement was a landmark achievement.
The transitional government has little control outside Mogadishu
"Rays of hope on the prospects of peace in Somalia are now more evident than ever before," he said.
Under the deal, the signatories reportedly agreed to observe a truce; pave the way for a national federal government; fight terrorism; improve the safety of foreign aid workers; and adhere to the outcome of the conference.
The groups are also said to have agreed to the setting up of a monitoring system to ensure the terms of the agreement are implemented.
Regional analysts said this could lead to international observers or peace keepers being deployed in the country.
Descent into chaos
Somalia has had no effective central government since President Mohamed Siad Barre was deposed in 1991.
The transitional government was established in August, 2000, but has little control outside the capital, Mogadishu.
Fighting between rival clans and warlords has plagued Somalia and all previous ceasefires have collapsed.
The latest agreement has the backing of Somalia's neighbours, the United States, the European Union and the Arab League.
Talks are planned to continue until the end of the year.

Kuwait bans anti-Bush documentary
Moore's film has sparked controversy across the world
Kuwait has banned Michael Moore's controversial documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, calling the film insulting to the Saudi Arabian royal family. Authorities in Kuwait, a US ally, also objected to the film's criticism of America's invasion of Iraq.
"We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations," said Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour of the Information Ministry.
The controversy over Fahrenheit 9/11 has helped it break box office records for a documentary.
The film, which won the Cannes Film Festival, was the first documentary to make $100m (�54.5m) in North America.
It criticises President George Bush for being unprepared for the 11 September attacks and using propaganda to gain public support.
The Saudi royal family also features, along with claims that Saudi nationals were allowed to flee the US in the aftermath of 11 September despite the country's airspace being closed. 'Failed research'
Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour said the film "insulted the Saudi royal family by
saying they had common interests with the Bush family and
that those interests contradicted with the interests of the
American people".
He added: "The movie made Iraq look like a paradise whose problems
started with the American invasion. It would have angered Kuwaitis."
Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to
London, has said Moore failed to carry out proper research for the documentary.
He said the film "criticised America's policy on invading Iraq and this was tantamount
to criticizing Kuwait for [what it did] to liberate Iraq".
The state-owned Kuwait National Cinema Co had applied for a license to show Fahrenheit 9/11 but its request was turned down by government censors. It is showing in other Middle Eastern countries including the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon. Meanwhile, a US newspaper is seeking a token $1 in damages from Michael Moore and the film's distributor, Lion's Gate, for allegedly doctoring its front page for the documentary.
The Pantagraph newspaper, based in Bloomington, Illinois, said the film included a shot showing a front page headline "Latest Florida recount shows Gore won the election" that never actually appeared on page one. It said the headline only appeared in much smaller type on the letters page which reflects "only the opinions of the letter writer".
"If [Moore] wants to 'edit' The Pantagraph, he should
apply for a copy-editing job," the paper said.

Berlusconi's wife to divorce him
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Ms Lario is the PM's second wife
The wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has confirmed that she will file for divorce.
Veronica Lario reportedly said she could not be with a man who "consorted with minors" after her husband attended a female friend's 18th birthday party. She had also clashed with her husband over his party's plan to choose certain female election candidates. The 72-year-old billionaire prime minister said it was a personal matter that saddened him, without elaborating. Ms Lario is Mr Berlusconi's second wife and a former actress. The couple, who have been married for 19 years, have three children, all in their 20s. 'Shameless rubbish'
La Repubblica, a leading Italian newspaper, said Ms Lario's decision came after reading about the 18th birthday party in Naples. "That's enough, I cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors", she was quoted as saying. Another newspaper, La Stampa, quoted Ms Lario as saying she had been "forced to take this step".

"This really surprised me, because he never came to any 18th birthday party for his children, despite being invited," the paper quoted her as saying earlier. Mr Berlusconi was reported to have bought the woman a golden necklace studded with diamonds as a present. Following his wife's reaction, Mr Berlusconi was quoted as saying he was sorry his wife "had let herself be fooled by left-wing newspapers". Relations with her husband were already said to be frayed after Ms Lario had criticised her husband's choice of young and attractive female candidates with little political experience to represent his Freedom Party in the forthcoming European elections. In an e-mail to an Italian news agency, she said the plan amounted to "shameless rubbish" being put on "for the entertainment of the emperor". "What's happening today [in Italy] behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave," she wrote. Flirting
Mr Berlusconi said his centre-right party was aiming to select female candidates because "we want to renew our political class with people who are cultured and well prepared". Candidates standing for the party would be unlike the "malodorous and badly dressed people who represent certain parties in parliament", Mr Berlusconi added.

It was later announced that Barbara Matera - an actress, TV announcer and former Miss Italy contestant - was the only one of the candidates to have made the final list. In a brief statement about the reports of divorce, Mr Berlusconi said: "This is a personal matter that saddens me, that is private, and it seems appropriate not to talk about it." Mr Berlusconi courted Ms Lario in 1980 after watching her perform topless in a play. They married ten years later. Two years ago he issued a public apology to his wife for flirting with young starlets, among them Mara Carfagna, who he later appointed as equal opportunities minister. She said her husband had told the women: "If I wasn't already married I would marry you right away". In 2003 Berlusconi acknowledged during a press conference rumours linking his wife to a left-wing philosophy professor and mayor, Massimo Cacciari. Ms Lario has occasionally taken political positions at odds with her husband's, such as her backing for protesters demonstrating against the war in Iraq, which Mr Berlusconi supported. Mr Berlusconi has two elder children from a previous marriage who now hold senior positions in his media empire. The Italian prime minister's private fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $6.5bn (£4.4bn).

Insurers mull cancer gene tests
By Paul Rincon
Science reporter, BBC News
The GAIC has to approve applications to use predictive tests
UK insurers have told an advisory body they may seek approval to use the results of genetic tests for inherited cancers in setting premiums after 2007.
This would allow insurers to ask about tests for gene mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer.
Approval applies to high value policies only; a moratorium exists on the use of genetic tests in all other policies.
But campaigners fear such proposals could be expanded if the moratorium is not renewed once it runs out in 2011.
At present, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has to ask the Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC), which advises the government on the issue, for permission to request details from customers of genetic tests.
Since 1999, the GAIC has approved just one application, which allows insurers to use predictive test results for Huntington's disease in life insurance policies over �500,000. "The ABI has said that it may come forward with applications covering specific predictive genes for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, but not until 2008 at the earliest," the Department of Health's Genetics and Insurance Committee said in its most recent update.
Predictive test
Last year, newspapers reported that the ABI would seek official permission to use predictive tests for the illnesses, but the association subsequently declined to submit an application in 2006/2007.
A spokesperson for the ABI reiterated that no application would be submitted for this period but did not dispute the statement in the GAIC report. The basis for the tests are mutations or changes in the genes BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 carried by some individuals. These changes have a dramatic effect on the chances of a woman developing the diseases. Female carriers of BRCA-1 mutations have a lifetime risk of breast cancer exceeding 80% and of ovarian cancer approaching 60%. Carriers of BRCA-2 mutations have a similar risk of breast cancer and a more moderately increased risk of ovarian cancer.
BRCA mutations account for about 5% of the 44,000 new cases of breast cancer each year in Britain and 10% of the 7,000 ovarian cancers diagnosed annually.
The voluntary UK moratorium covers income protection policies up to the value of �30,000 per year, critical illness up to the value of �300,000, and life insurance of �500,000. It accounts for about 97% of insurance policies.
Above these ceilings, insurance companies can use the results of tests approved by the GAIC.
Legislation call
Some campaigners are worried about this apparent renewal of interest by insurers in predictive tests for BRCA genes.
Dr Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK, told BBC News: "If the committee approves an application, it will only be for those high value policies initially; but once the moratorium runs out in 2011, it could mean that it is applied much more widely.
"We still think the industry should drop plans to use these genetic test results at all and that there should be legislation to prevent the insurance industry from refusing someone insurance, or charging a higher premium on the basis of a predictive genetic test."
There are concerns that members of the public will decline to take genetic tests for hereditary illnesses because of fears over how the results could be used.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: "Choosing to have a predictive genetic test can be life-saving, and nobody should be put off having such a test because of fears it will be used against them by insurers. "Genetic tests that may predict disease have only recently been developed, but the current moratorium we negotiated with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) sets out a stable and sensible environment to help support the future development of genetics."
In the US, the Genetic Information and Non-discrimination Act (Gina) has been passed by the House of Representatives and will go before the Senate later this year.
The act would prohibit insurers from requesting or using genetic information when establishing premiums and prevent employers from using such information when hiring or promoting individuals.
The UK moratorium on the use of predictive genetic tests is due to stand until November 2011.

Rutland Telecom offers villagers fast broadband

Graham Satchell meets the people of Rutland who set up their own high speed broadband service
A UK village which raised £37,000 to offer 200 homes the super-fast broadband that BT could not deliver has launched its network.Rutland Telecom will offer the residents of Lyddington speeds of up to 40Mbps (megabits per second). Other telecom firms had said it was not economical to provide fast services to the village. Getting fast broadband to rural areas is back in the spotlight as the government shelves its funding plans. It is estimated that around 2.5 million homes in the UK cannot get broadband speeds of more than 2Mbps. The Rutland Telecom scheme was a joint effort between villagers fed up with slow broadband speeds and a local ICT firm that was reselling BT's broadband. Street cabinetThey discovered that there was nothing to stop them becoming a telco. "We found that any company could do, on a smaller scale, what Carphone Warehouse has done and take over BT's network," said Dr David Lewis, managing director of Rutland Telecom. HAVE YOUR SAY

They asked Openreach, the BT spin-off that has responsibility for the UK's telephone network, to supply fibre-optic cable to a street cabinet in the village. It was a slow process and required the intervention of regulator Ofcom but two years later the telco is up and running and already has 50 customers. "For the first time in UK telecommunications history the telephone lines of customers are completely cut off from the local BT exchange," said Rutland Telecom director Mark Melluish. BT said it was "delighted to help Rutland Telecom" although it added that it hoped it would allow other service providers access to its new network. Public funds
Lyddington is one of many rural areas with slow broadband
"Otherwise there is the risk of a local monopoly developing, which is never good for consumers," said BT Group Strategy Director Olivia Garfield. Rutland Telecom has been approached by 40 other rural community groups to see if a similar solution is possible in their area. It is on the verge of launching similar schemes in neighbouring Leicestershire and one in Wales. The government has pledged to offer all homes a minimum speed of 2Mbps (megabits per second) by 2012. But critics say these speeds are far too slow for the ever-increasing demands of web users. There are concerns that up to one third of the country will not be served by next-generation broadband - offering speeds of over 25Mbps. For commercial firms such as BT and Virgin Media fibre rollouts in rural areas are not cost-effective. In their place community solutions are springing up and it is estimated that there are 40 such schemes currently laying fibre or planning to do so. Daniel Heery is involved in laying fibre to 1,000 homes in Alston village in Cumbria. The network will offer speeds of up to 100Mbps when it is completed later this year. He welcomed the privately-funded Rutland scheme. "Different approaches will work in different areas and we will have a patchwork quilt of different technologies," he said. The endgame for Mr Heery is to offer fibre all the way to homes but he acknowledged that he relied on public funds for this. In the North Yorkshire village of Newton-on-Rawcliffe, the solution to slow broadband has come via fibre supplied to the local school. The 140 villagers will benefit from the fibre link via a wireless connection. The fibre has been supplied by NYnet, one of Europe's largest public-sector funded broadband infrastructures.

Rural divideBut public money, often supplied by regional development agencies, is fast drying up, according to Mr Lewis. The government had proposed to raise £170m a year via a broadband tax, which would have seen all households with a landline phone charged an extra £6 a year. The money would have been used to fund broadband to rural areas but the Tories opposed the tax and it was shelved in last-ditch negotiations to get the Finance Bill through parliament before the general election. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has been one of the most vocal critics of the lack of government investment in broadband. It welcomed the Rutland Telecom launch but called for the next government to reassess the need for publicly-funded broadband rollouts. "Without that money the rural/urban digital divide will extend and that will have a significantly adverse impact on the economy," said CLA's Dr Charles Trotman. Comedian and technology enthusiast Stephen Fry went to school in the neighbouring town of Uppingham and welcomed the Rutland Telecom launch. "It has always been a frustration that fast, reliable broadband service has always been hardest for those who most benefit - those in the countryside," he said.

Tube posters reveal child poverty
Shocking images of children brought up in overcrowded housing are being shown on the London Underground to raise commuters' awareness of child poverty.
Digital poster screens of youngsters trapped in squalid conditions will appear at three Tube stations.
The homeless charity Shelter said it wants to show what life is like for some 400,000 children in the city.
The images will appear by escalators at Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross and Paddington underground stations.
The charity wants the government to build 20,000 extra social homes each year around the UK to tackle the housing crisis.

Royal coverage 'was over the top'
By Matt Holder
NewsWatch
Did the BBC go overboard in its coverage of the Charles and Camilla wedding story? Did the story justify so much airtime - as well as a BBC News Special? Not according to some viewers and listeners.
It was news but did it warrant the amount of attention it received?
Few people would deny that the future King's marriage announcement was news and needed to be reported.
But what rankled the many people who called and emailed the BBC was the amount of coverage the story was given.
Every programme from the Six O'Clock News on BBC One to the World at One on Radio Four received calls to complain about too much coverage, one accusing news teams of being "on the verge of hysteria".
'A belly-full'
Sean Martin e-mailed in to say: "Please, please, please give us all a break from Charles and Camilla.
"I personally feel the public have had more than a belly-full of the whole scenario."
Simon Brownsill wrote: "Please give it a rest about Prince C and Camilla.
"The vast majority of people in this country, myself and my family really don't care and would rather hear about some other more meaningful news."
And Simon Whomsley questioned the running orders: "Camilla and Charles to marry; Pope returns home; North Korea has confirmed it has nuclear weapons.
VIEWING FIGURES
4.1m people (20% audience share) watched the 7pm News Special on BBC One
1.4m page views for lead story on BBC News website - one of the highest ever figures
1.1m (25% audience share) watched the 10am News Special on BBC One
1.6m (25% audience share) watched the 12.30pm News Special on BBC One
"What is happening in the world? This is the order that the news was presented tonight! Absolutely amazing."
On the same subject, Mike Taulty wrote: "On the Ten O'Clock News you seemed to spend 15 minutes on Prince Charles getting married and then you switched to 'other news'.
"The first item of the 'other news' was...North Korea has admitted that it has nuclear weapons and has withdrawn from talks.
"How do you prioritise Prince Charles above a story that potentially has ramifications for World security?"
'Tabloid gossip column'
The time devoted to the story on bulletins annoyed many people.
Martin Barlett wrote: "I have just watched the Six O'Clock News - or should I say the Charles and Camilla news, as 3/4 of it was solely about them and not about the other things happening all over the World.
"I was of the opinion that the BBC was a quality broadcaster and not a tabloid gossip column."
Did the BBC need a News Special after so much coverage earlier?
Dozens of people also called in to complain that the BBC News Special: Charles and Camilla at 7pm on BBC One saw programmes such as Wildlife on One dropped.
Rachel Willetts said: "I was shocked, and perhaps even disappointed that BBC News, the most respected public service in the world, should devote a 'news special' to a story which, quite frankly, nobody really cares about."
And Kate Snowden added: "Whilst finding the news mildly interesting, I fail to see how it warrants a 'special programme' at 7pm which means you postpone the Wildlife on One which I have been eagerly awaiting.
"This is a 'double whammy', as it is sadly the last in what I consider to be one of your better and more unique contributions."
Massive audience
In response, the BBC said on its Complaints website: "The BBC believes the announcement about the heir to the throne is an important news story that not only merits coverage across our scheduled news bulletins but deserves to be reported in separate programmes.
"We recognise that not all viewers are interested in stories relating to the Royal Family, but equally there is a significant audience who do wish to be informed of such decisions."
Read the full response on the BBC Complaints website
Although it might not have pleased everyone, the News Special did pull in an audience of 4.1 million people - the second most popular programme in its slot apart from Emmerdale.
Earlier news specials also saw millions of people tune in.
And the Charles and Camilla lead article was the most-read story of the day on the BBC News website, with more than one million page impressions. Related articles also drew in a lot of readers.

Jones rules out England position
Jones previously said he would give a 10-month deal with England 'serious consideration'
Former Australia coach Eddie Jones has effectively ruled out taking up a role with England in the near future by committing himself to Queensland Reds.
"I have to give Queensland a number of months' notice and they have to give me a number of months' notice," he said.
"Having said all that, I can assure you I'll be coaching Queensland in the Super 14 this year (2007)."
But he added: "Like any coach at the end of the season (in May) you don't know where you stand."
Jones had previously said he could be tempted by an England offer up to and including next year's World Cup, having expressed his desire to return to international coaching. 606 DEBATE: Your reaction to Jones's decision
He signed a three-year deal with the Reds in January, initially working in a player development role before taking over as head coach from Jeff Miller after this year's Super 14.
But he took up a three-month consultancy role with Saracens in March, helping them stay in the Premiership, and admitted he could still be tempted by offers at the end of the Super 14 season in May 2007.
Rugby Football Union director of rugby Rob Andrew made his recommendations to the Club England committee last Thursday on who should replace the departed Andy Robinson as head coach, if anyone, in the short term.
Those will be put forward to the RFU's Management Board on 20 December.
