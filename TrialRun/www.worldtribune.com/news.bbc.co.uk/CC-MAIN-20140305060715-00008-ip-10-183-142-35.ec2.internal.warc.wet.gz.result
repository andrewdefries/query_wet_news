Mars Odyssey: The facts
A space craft has entered the orbit of Mars, where it will search for signs of water on the Red Planet. BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse explains the facts of the mission.
Why is it called 2001 Mars Odyssey?
It was inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, the movie written by Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, a movie that had nothing to do with Mars.
How far has it travelled to get to Mars?
The craft has travelled 460 million km (286 million miles) in six and a half months.
How big is it and how much did it cost? The 725 kg (1,598 pound) unmanned satellite is 2.1 metres (7.2 feet) long, 1.7 m (5.6 feet) tall and 2.6 m (8.5 feet) wide. It cost $297 million (�209 million). What happens now the probe has entered the orbit of Mars?
The probe will gradually settle into a circular orbit at an altitude of some 400 kilometres (250 miles) above the Martian surface. The adjustment happens by a series of delicate breaking manoeuvres, called aerobraking.
What scientific observations will it carry out?
The probe is carrying a gamma ray spectrometer, which includes a high-energy neutron detector, as well as a thermal-emission imaging system and a Martian radiation environment experiment. It will use these instruments to carry out a chemical and mineralogical survey of the planet. It will also look for hidden reservoirs of water and assess radiation risks to future human missions. Mars Odyssey is expected to start mapping the surface of Mars in January.
How long is the mission?
Mars Odyssey's primary scientific mission lasts from January 2002 to July 2004 but if it remains in good order it would be extended. The spacecraft also will serve as a communications relay for US and international spacecraft in 2003 and 2004. What other missions are planned?
Twin American surface rovers are planned for 2004 as well as a British lander called Beagle 2, which is set to land on the planet in next three years. Further Mars orbiters are planned for after that and then, hopefully, a sample return mission.

Moon probe returns first images
By Paul Rincon
Science reporter, BBC News
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) reached the Moon on 23 June
Enlarge Image The US space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft has returned its first images since reaching the Moon on 23 June.LRO's camera instrument took images of a region in the lunar highlands south of Mare Nubium (Sea of Clouds). The probe blasted off on 18 June atop an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Its data will help mission planners select future landing sites and scout locations for lunar outposts. The spacecraft is carrying three cameras on board: one low-resolution wide-angle camera and two high-resolution narrow-angle cameras mounted side-by-side. These are known collectively as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) instrument. "At the time we took the images, we were in the 'terminator' orbit. This means that when you look down for a whole orbit, all you see beneath you is the boundary between night and day," Mark Robinson, from Arizona State University in Tempe, US, told BBC News.
We waited a couple of hours for the images to come down to the ground. When they appeared on the screen, they were gorgeous
Professor Mark Robinson, ASU
This meant that light levels were low and that much of the surface was in shadow - not ideal conditions for photography. "In some areas where we thought we'd see the surface, we didn't, because local topography caused some things to be shadowed. While in other areas, we were able to see the surface," explained Professor Robinson, who is the principal scientific investigator for LROC. The images were taken over two orbits on Tuesday, during an engineering test of the LROC instrument. Though they are not part of the formal imaging campaign, Mark Robinson described them as "spectacular". "It was a huge relief. You spend four years making this incredibly delicate, sensitive instrument. Then you bolt it on a rocket, which vibrates for eight minutes," he said.
The pictures are of cratered terrain near the Mare Nubium region
Enlarge Image "It's maybe an illogical nervousness, because everything is designed and tested to withstand that. But there are hundreds of people that want it to work. "We turned it on, and held our breath. Then we waited a couple of hours for the images to come down to the ground. When they appeared on the screen, they were gorgeous." The test was designed to check parameters on LROC such as the exposure. Scientists also wanted to see whether the camera was in full focus. LROC uses a telescope structure made of carbon fibre. Though lightweight, this material absorbs water from the Earth's atmosphere, causing it to expand. The team had to build the camera so that it was out of focus on Earth. But once in space, the carbon fibre telescope can be baked to drive the water out. This causes the structure to shrink and bring the instrument into focus.
LRO'S SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS
CRaTER - will characterise the global lunar radiation environment
Diviner - is to measure lunar surface temperatures
LAMP - will map the Moon's permanently shadowed regions
LEND - measures the flux of neutrons from the Moon
LOLA - will provide a global lunar topographic model
LROC - LRO's camera will help select future landing sites
Mini-RF - uses radar to search for evidence of water ice
"It's roughly a three-week process, and we had only been baking out for 10 days when we turned (LROC) on," said Professor Robinson. Nevertheless, he said the pictures suggested the camera was about 80% of the way to being in full focus. On Friday, LROC will begin taking images "in earnest". Over two-and-a-half days, and 32 orbits, it will photograph some of the least known regions of the lunar surface, on the Moon's far side. On Sunday, engineers will switch the LROC instrument off again to resume the baking process. The spacecraft is currently in an elliptical orbit around the Moon, with a low point of 30km above the south pole and a high point of 199km over the north pole. This means the resolution of pictures will be lower in the north and higher in the south. In mid-August, the spacecraft will perform a burn to bring it into a circular orbit of 50km above the lunar surface. This will give LROC a resolution of 50cm per pixel. This month marks the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. LRO will start flying over the Apollo landing sites in mid-July. However, the spacecraft will still be in its checkout phase at this time. If LRO does manage to take images of any Apollo sites in July, the pictures will not be at the best possible resolution. When the orbiter flies over the Apollo 11 site it is likely to be at an altitude of 100km - allowing the camera to capture images at a resolution of 100cm per pixel. LRO will spend at least one year using its six instruments to collect detailed information about the lunar environment. The orbiter was one of two payloads launched on the same Atlas V rocket. The second mission, called the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), will send a rocket crashing into the Moon to scour the debris plume for evidence of water ice.

Lawrence: Key recommendations
Click here to read Sir William Macpherson's full report on the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.
The Macpherson Report into the Stephen Lawrence case contains 70 key recommendations for society to show "zero tolerance" for racism.
They include measures aimed at improving the accountability of the police.
But Sir William Macpherson's report also demands action in other public bodies. The judicial system, the civil service, local government, the NHS and schools will all have to make changes if the recommendations are implemented in full.
Recommendations in full:
Openess, accountability, and the restoration of confidence 1. That a Ministerial Priority be established for all Police Services: "To
increase trust and confidence in policing amongst minority ethnic
communities".
2. The process of implementing, monitoring and assessing the Ministerial Priority should include Performance Indicators in relation to:
the existence and application of strategies for the prevention
recording, investigation and prosecution of racist incidents;
measures to encourage reporting of racist incidents;
the number of recorded racist incidents and related detection levels;
the degree of multi-agency cooperation and information exchange;
achieving equal satisfaction levels across all ethnic groups in public
satisfaction surveys;
the adequacy of provision and training of family and witness/victim
liaison officers;
the nature, extent and achievement of racism awareness training;
the policy directives governing stop and search procedures and their
outcomes;
levels of recruitment, retention and progress of minority ethnic recruits; and levels of complaint of racist behaviour or attitude and their
outcomes. The overall aim being the elimination of racist prejudice and disadvantage and
the demonstration of fairness in all aspects of policing.
3. That Her Majesty's Inspectors of Constabulary (HMIC) be granted full and unfettered powers and duties to inspect all parts of Police Services including
the Metropolitan Police Service.
4. That in order to restore public confidence an inspection by HMIC of the Metropolitan Police Service be conducted forthwith. The inspection to include examination of current undetected HOLMES based murders and reviews into such cases.
5. That principles and standards similar to those of the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) be applied to inspections of police services, in order to
improve standards of achievement and quality of policing through regular
inspection, public reporting and informed independent advice.
6. That proposals as to the formation of the Metropolitan Police Authority be
reconsidered, with a view to bringing its functions and powers fully into line
with those which apply to other police services, including the power to appoint
all chief officers of the Metropolitan Police Service.
7. That the Home Secretary and police authorities should seek to ensure that
the membership of police authorities reflects so far as possible the cultural
and ethnic mix of the communities which those authorities serve.
8. That HMIC shall be empowered to recruit and to use lay inspectors in order
to conduct examination and inspection of police services particularly in
connection with performance in the area of investigation of racist crime.
9. That a Freedom of Information Act should apply to all areas of policing,
both operational and administrative, subject only to the "substantial harm"
test for withholding disclosure.
10. That investigating officers' reports resulting from public complaints
should not attract Public Interest Immunity as a class. They should be disclosed
to complainants, subject only to the "substantial harm" test for withholding
disclosure.
11. That the full force of the race relations legislation should apply to all
police officers, and that chief officers of police should be made vicariously
liable for the acts and omissions of their officers relevant to that
legislation.
Definition of racist incident
12. That the definition should be: "A racist incident is any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person."
13. That the term "racist incident" must be understood to include crimes and
non-crimes in policing terms. Both must be reported, recorded and investigated with equal commitment.
14. That this definition should be universally adopted by the police, local government and other relevant agencies.
Reporting and recording of racist incidents and crimes
15. That codes of practice be established by the Home Office, in consultation
with police services, local government and relevant agencies, to create a
comprehensive system of reporting and recording of all racist incidents and
crimes.
16. That all possible steps should be taken by police services at local level
in consultation with local government and other agencies and local communities
to encourage the reporting of racist incidents and crimes. This should include:
the ability to report at locations other than police stations;
the ability to report 24 hours a day.
17. That there should be close co-operation between police services and local
government and other agencies, including in particular housing and education
departments, to ensure that all information as to racist incidents and crimes is
shared and is readily available to all agencies.
Police practice and the investigation of racist of crime 18. That ACPO, in consultation with local Government and other relevant
agencies, should review its Good Practice Guide for Police Response to Racial
Incidents in the light of this report and our recommendations. Consideration
should be given to the production by ACPO of a manual or model for such
investigation, to complement their current Manual of Murder Investigation.
19. That ACPO devise Codes of Practice to govern reviews of investigations of
crime, in order to ensure that such reviews are open and thorough. Such codes
should be consistently used by all Police Services. Consideration should be
given to such practice providing for reviews to be carried out by an external
Police Service.
20. That MPS procedures at the scene of incidents be reviewed in order to
ensure co-ordination between uniformed and CID officers and to ensure that
senior officers are aware of and fulfil the command responsibilities which their
role demands.
21. That the MPS review their procedures for the recording and retention of
information in relation to incidents and crimes, to ensure that adequate records
are made by individual officers and specialist units in relation to their
functions, and that strict rules require the retention of all such records as
long as an investigation remains open.
22. That MPS review their internal inspection and accountability processes to
ensure that policy directives are observed.
Family liaison
23. That police services should ensure that at local level there are readily
available designated and trained family liaison officers.
24. That training of family liaison officers must include training in racism
awareness and cultural diversity, so that the families are treated
appropriately, professionally, with respect and according to their needs.
25. That family liaison officers shall, where appointed, be dedicated
primarily if not exclusively to that task.
26. That senior investigation officers and family liaison officers be made
aware that good practice and their positive duty shall be the satisfactory
management of family liaison, together with the provision to a victim's family
of all possible information about the crime and its investigation.
27. That good practice shall provide that any request made by the family of a
victim which is not acceded to, and any complaint by any member of the family,
shall be formally recorded by the SIO and shall be reported to the immediate
superior officer.
28. That police services and victim support services ensure that their systems
provide for the pro-active use of local contacts within minority ethnic
communities to assist with family liaison where appropriate.
Victims and witnesses
29. That police services should, together with the Home Office, develop
guidelines as to the handling of victims and witnesses, particularly in the
field of racist incidents and crimes. The victim's charter to be reviewed in
this context.
30. That police services and victim support services ensure that their systems
provide for the pro-active use of local contacts within minority ethnic
communities to assist with victim support and with the handling and interviewing
of sensitive witnesses.
31. That police services ensure the provision of training and the availability
of victim/witness liaison officers, and ensure their use in appropriate areas,
particularly in the field of racist incidents and crimes, where the need for a
sensitive approach to young and vulnerable victims and witnesses is paramount.
Prosecution of racist crimes
32. That the standard of proof of such crimes should remain unchanged.
33. That the CPS should consider that, in deciding whether a criminal
prosecution should proceed, once the CPS evidential test is satisfied, there
should be a rebuttable presumption that the public interest test should be in
favour of prosecution.
34. That police services and the CPS should ensure that particular care is
taken at all stages of prosecution to recognise and to include reference to any
evidence of racist motivation. In particular it should be the duty of the CPS to
ensure that such evidence is referred to both at trial and in the sentencing
process (including Newton hearings). The CPS and counsel to ensure that no
"plea bargaining" should ever be allowed to exclude such evidence.
35. That the CPS ensure that a victim or victim's family shall be consulted
and kept informed as to any proposal to discontinue proceedings.
36. That the CPS should have the positive duty always to notify a victim and
victim's family personally of a decision to discontinue, particularly in cases
of a racist crime, with speed and sensitivity.
37. That the CPS ensure that all decisions to discontinue any prosecution
should be carefully and fully recorded in writing, and that save in exceptional
circumstances, such written decisions should be disclosable to a victim or a
victim's family.
38. That consideration should be given to the Court of Appeal being given
power to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is
presented.
39. That consideration should be given to amendment of the law to allow
prosecution of offences involving racist language or behaviour, and of offences
involving the possession of offensive weapons, where such conduct can be proved
to have taken place otherwise than in a public place.
40. That the ability to initiate a private prosecution should remain
unchanged.
41. That consideration should be given to the proposition that victims or
victims' families should be allowed to become "civil parties" to criminal
proceedings, to facilitate and to ensure the provision of all relevant
information to victims or their families.
42. That there should be advance disclosure of evidence and documents as of
right to parties who have leave from a coroner to appear at an inquest.
43. That consideration be given to the provision of legal aid to victims or the
families of victims to cover representation at an inquest in appropriate cases.
44. That police services and the courts seek to prevent the intimidation of
victims and witnesses by imposing appropriate bail conditions.
Training First aid
45. That first aid training for all "public contact" police officers
(including senior officers) should at once be reviewed and revised to ensure
that they have basic skills to apply first aid officers must be taught to
"think first aid", and first and foremost "A (Airways), B (Breathing) and C
(Circulation)".
46. That training in first aid, including refresher training, should include
testing to recognised and published standards in every police service.
47. That police services should annually review first aid training, and ensure
that "public contact" officers are trained and tested to recognised and
published standards.
Racism awareness and valuing cultural diversity 48.That there should be immediate review and revision of racism awareness
training within police services to ensure:
that there exists a consistent strategy to deliver appropriate training
within all police services, based upon the value of our cultured diversity;
that training courses are designed and delivered in order to develop the
full understanding that good community relations are essential to good policing
and that a racist officer is an incompetent officer.
49. That all police officers, including CID and civilian staff, should be
training in racism awareness and valuing cultural diversity.
50. That police training and practical experience in the field of racism
awareness and valuing cultural diversity should regularly be conducted at local
level. And that it should be recognised that local minority ethnic communities
should be involved in such training and experience.
51. That consideration be given by police services to promotion joint training
with members of other organisations or professions otherwise than on police
premises.
52. That the Home Office, together with police services, should publish
recognised standards of training aims and objectives in the field of racism
awareness and valuing cultural diversity.
53. That there should be independent and regular monitoring of training within
all police services to test both implementation and achievement of such training.
54. That consideration be given to a review of the provision of training in
racism awareness and valuing cultural diversity in local government and other
agencies including other sections of the criminal justice system.
Employment, discipline and complaints
55. That the changes to police disciplinary and complaints procedures proposed
by the Home Secretary should be fully implemented and closely and publicly
monitored as to their effectiveness.
56. That in order to eliminate the present provision which prevents disciplinary action after retirement, disciplinary action should be available
for at least five years after an officer's retirement.
57. That the police services should, through the implementation of a code of
conduct or otherwise, ensure that racist words or acts proved to have been
spoken or done by police officers should lead to disciplinary proceedings, and
that it should be understood that such conduct should usually merit dismissal.
58. That the Home Secretary, taking into account the strong expression of
public perception in this regard, consider what steps can and should be taken to
ensure that serious complaints against police officers are independently
investigated. Investigation of police officers by their own or another police
service is widely regarded as unjust, and does not inspire public confidence.
59. That the Home Office review and monitor the system and standards of police
services applied to the selection and promotion of officers of the rank of
inspector and above. Such procedures for selection and promotion to be monitored
and assessed regularly.
Stop and search
60. That the powers of the police under current legislation are required for
the prevention and detection of crime and should remain unchanged.
61. That the Home Secretary, in consultation with police services, should
ensure that a record is made by police officers of all "stops" and "stops and
searches" made under any legislative provision (not just the police and
Criminal Evidence Act). Non-statutory or so called "voluntary" stops must also
be recorded. The record to include the reason for the stop, the outcome, and the
self-defined ethnic identity of the person stopped. A copy of the record shall be given to the person stopped.
62. That these records should be monitored and analysed by police services and
police authorities, and reviewed by HMIC on inspections. The information and
analysis should be published.
63. That police authorities be given the duty to undertake publicity campaigns
to ensure that the public is aware of "stop and search" provisions and the
right to receive a record in all circumstances.
Recruitment and retention
64. That the Home Secretary and police authorities' policing plans should
include targets for recruitment, progression and retention of minority ethnic
staff. Police authorities to report progress to the Home Secretary annually.
Such reports to be published.
65. That the Home Office and the police services should facilitate the
development of initiatives to increase the number of qualified minority ethnic
recruits.
66. That HMIC include in any regular inspection or in a thematic inspection a
report on the progress made by police services in recruitment, progression and
retention of minority ethnic staff.
Prevention and the role of education 67. That consideration be given to amendment of the National Curriculum aimed
at valuing cultural diversity and preventing racism, in order better to reflect
the needs of a diverse society.
68. That local education authorities and school governors have the duty to
create and implement strategies in their schools to prevent and address racism.
Such strategies to include:
that schools record all racist incidents;
that all recorded incidents are reported to the pupils' parents/guardians,
school governors and LEAs;
that the numbers of racist incidents are published annually, on a school by
school basis; that the numbers and self defined ethnic identity of "excluded" pupils
are published annually on a school by school basis.
69. That OFSTED inspections include examination of the implementation of such
strategies.
70. That in creating strategies under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder
Act or otherwise police services, local government and relevant agencies should
specifically consider implementing community and local initiatives aimed at
promoting cultural diversity and addressing racism and the need for focused,
consistent support for such initiatives.

Witness plan for 'honour' cases
A special government unit tackles the issue of forced marriages
Police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are being urged to review their witness protection schemes to help combat "honour crimes".
A new Association of Chief Police Officers document aims to help forces identify potential victims and ensure all steps are taken to protect them.
It says it is also essential religious and community leaders are encouraged to speak out against such crimes.
Every year police investigate about a dozen suspected honour killings.
Honour crimes are described as attacks or killings where the perpetrator's motive is to protect what they consider to be a family, clan or community's honour.
Police also investigate an average of 500 reports a year from people who fear being forced into marriage or people who are in a forced marriage and have been threatened or abused.
'Perverted notions'
Some 65% of the forced marriage cases dealt with by a specialist government team involve Pakistani families.
Experts say honour crimes can be seen in many different cultures.
The move by Acpo comes on the eve of new laws to protect potential victims of forced marriages.
The strategy document, which contains 19 recommendations, says that under no circumstances should honour-crime victims be turned away and told that honour-based violence is not the police's problem.
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. More from Today programme
Incidents must be properly recorded and investigated, says the document.
Potential victims should be given witness protection because of the dangers they face, even if they are not prepared to make a statement against the people thought to be threatening their safety.
Steve Allen, a Metropolitan Police commander and Acpo's lead on honour-based violence said: "To the best of our knowledge, 12 people are murdered every year for transgressing someone else's perverted notions of honour.
"We do not know how many commit suicide as an alternative or an escape.
"We know that around 500 men and women report to us every year their fear of being forced into marriage, or their experience of rape, assault, false imprisonment and much more, as the consequence of being in marriage without their consent.
We will do everything in our power, working alongside our communities, to keep people safe and end these abuses
Steve Allen, Acpo
"The police response to this issue has nothing to do with political correctness and nothing to do with inappropriate sensitivities.
"The police response is about saving life, protecting those at risk of harm and bringing perpetrators to account. We will do everything in our power, working alongside our communities, to keep people safe and end these abuses."
Next month sees the introduction of new powers to use court orders to protect people from forced marriages.
The special sanctions, ordered by a judge, will allow police to seize passports or take other steps, including arrest, to prevent someone forcing a man or a woman into a marriage they do not want.
Anyone who breaks an order will face jail.
Crucially, the law has been drawn up to allow third parties to intervene where the victim is too scared to act or contact the authorities.
Campaigners from a range of ethnic and religious backgrounds have lobbied for years for more help on forced marriages and honour crimes, with some accusing leading community figures of ignoring the problem.

Obituary: Fashion king Alexander McQueen
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
'A controversial figure whose early creations earned him the title, hooligan of English fashion'
The fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who has been found dead at the age of 40, was seen as controversial and inspiring in equal measures.The son of a taxi driver, McQueen worked his way up from his roots in London's East End to the pinnacle of the British fashion industry. The youngest of six children from a working-class family, he left school at 16 in 1985 with one O-Level, but his rise was rapid. He started his career in Savile Row as an apprentice with Anderson & Sheppard before moving on to Gieves & Hawkes. He reportedly once scrawled "McQueen was here" inside the lining of a suit belonging to Prince Charles during his stint on the famous street for bespoke tailors. 'Bumsters'It was an early example of his showmanship and desire to cultivate notoriety in a business where it can pay dividends. In 1990 he studied for an MA at Central Saint Martins College, and two years later had his entire graduation collection bought for £5,000 by the late fashion stylist Isabella Blow.
Isabella Blow, who discovered McQueen, committed suicide in 2007
An influential figure at Tatler and Vogue, she plucked him from obscurity, taking delivery of his collection in black binliners. Blow is also said to have persuaded him to change his name from Lee to Alexander - his middle name - when he launched his career. She remained a close friend up to her death in May 2007 from an overdose of weed killer after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. McQueen launched his own line in London in 1992, grabbing headlines with his low cut "bumster" trousers which presented a new take on the cleavage. 'Fashion hooligan'By 1996 he had succeeded John Galliano as the head designer at fashion label Givenchy, to the dismay of the French press. His close-cropped hair, Doc Martens and feisty attitude earned him the label "the hooligan of English fashion".
McQueen once told the BBC it was "a nightmare thinking up new ideas"
But he went on to silence many of his critics with his renowned tailoring skills and his clothes always remained popular. In the same year he was voted British Designer of the Year - the first of four occasions between 1996 and 2003. That achievement was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours List when he was made a CBE. McQueen stayed with Givenchy for five years, until the end of his contract, which he said had started to "constrain" his creativity. He began a new partnership with Gucci Group, which bought 51% of his company, and boutiques followed in London, Milan and New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. He also launched a perfume range and collaborated with Puma on a special line of trainers. Singers Rihanna and Lady GaGa are among the many celebrities who wear his clothes. A scuba-diving fanatic, McQueen was openly gay, describing his coming out at a young age as going "straight from my mother's womb on to the gay parade". He entered into a civil partnership with documentary maker George Forsyth in a New Age ceremony on a yacht off Ibiza in 2001. Kate Moss was their bridesmaid.

Locals aim to buy mountain
Neighbouring Schehallion has also been purchased
A Highland community is aiming to buy a mountain and turn it into native woodland.
People living near Dun Coilich, near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, want to raise �170,000 to buy the rugged landscape, which was put on the market last year.
A community land trust has already been set up to channel support from 12,500 residents.
The trust plans to apply for a grant from the Scottish Land Trust to cover 75% of the sale price, which comes to about �130,000. The site is currently run as a deer park. Gigha residents bought their island
Local people hope to emulate other successful community buyout schemes such as those on the islands of Eigg and Gigha. The Highland Perthshire Community Land Trust steering group, which was set up in November, believes that the 1,100 acre Dun Coilich site has the potential to be converted into a beauty spot which could attract tourists. The group already has the support of the John Muir Trust, which owns the neighbouring mountain of Schiehallion and two years ago paid �1m for the 4,185 acre Ben Nevis estate.
Steering group spokeswoman Wendy Mattingley said: "At the moment Dun Coilich is overgrazed and overbrowsed and we would like to see it regenerated with native trees. 'Lot of potential'
"It was part of a deer farm and the hill ground was used for stalking. There are about 80 red deer on it and a few sheep which are fenced in. "It is a nice piece of hill ground with a gorge and some lovely craggy areas. It has a lot of potential. "The plan is for some of the planting to be done by schoolchildren, so in the future they will be able to take their grandchildren to see the trees which they planted." Mrs Mattingley added that the trust would aim to raise money for more land purchases in the area if its bid proved successful.

I slept with sharks!
Press Packer Max, 9, took part in a giant sleepover at the London Aquarium to raise money for the charity Save the Children.Here's his story:"I have been a cub for nearly two years. As a cub pack we took part in the Giant Sleepover at the London Aquarium. The Giant Sleepover is an event organised each year to raise money for charities, and we raised money for the Macmillan nurses. It is a fun-filled night for all. When we arrived at the London Aquarium we did a sponsored quiz, answering questions about the aquarium and what is there. We unpacked our sleeping bags by the shark tank, which was where we would be sleeping and got our pjs on for some photos. We had had an interesting talk on the sharks, made some badges and went into the cinema to watch Shark Tale. During the film I fell asleep and was woken up by my friends clapping and cheering at the end of the film, I think it was about 3am in the morning.

Then we made some sand creatures before finally going to bed. Akela (Our cub leader) woke us up at 7.30am as we had a Big Brush at 8am, to see if we could set a record for the most people brushing their teeth at the same time. Everyone on a sleepover was meant to be doing this as well, although I don't know how many people actually did it. We then had breakfast and were given a goody bag by the aquarium. The best bit for me was sleeping next to the sharks, (every time I woke up there were always sharks moving in the tank). The worst bit was being woken up. I had a really fun time and can't wait for next year!" Max, 9, London, EnglandWhy don't you write us a Press Pack report - and get it published on the site!It can be about anything that's happened in your local area - or your views on the news.
