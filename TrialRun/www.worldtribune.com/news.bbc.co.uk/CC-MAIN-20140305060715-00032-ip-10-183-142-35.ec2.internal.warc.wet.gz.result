McLeish's year in power
McLeish faced a turbulent year in power
By BBC News Online's Deirdre Kelly
Henry McLeish had been Scotland's first minister for just over a year when he tendered his resignation.
He was elected to the position following the death of Donald Dewar and inherited the toughest job in Scottish politics.
Many will remember when he was sworn in as first minister. His voice was breaking with emotion when he told MSPs last year: "This is a day of excitement, of exhilaration. This is a very great privilege. Thanks for the honour, I won't let you down."
Mr McLeish had a tough act to follow in Donald Dewar - the great father of Scottish politics whom, even from his sick bed, could exert control over his team.
It had long been thought that Mr McLeish would take over some day from the ageing Mr Dewar. But the timing was not of Mr McLeish's or Mr Dewar's making.
There has been a lot of dancing on pinheads in relation to this matter..... we are embracing the principles of Sutherland in full
Henry McLeish on Scotland's elderly care plan
When Mr Dewar died suddenly in September last year a leadership battle ensued between Mr McLeish and the then Finance Minister Jack McConnell.
Mr McConnell had solid rank and file support, but it was thought Mr McLeish's experience as an MP at Westminster helped him secure the post.
By the time Mr McLeish took the hot seat, the face of Scottish politics had changed.
Alex Salmond had gone as Scottish National Party leader and first minister's questions now featured two new names, Mr McLeish and John Swinney.
�110m cost
On the question of policy, a major defining issue for Mr McLeish has been free personal care for the elderly.
The Sutherland Commission recommended that, when older people need basic help to wash, dress and cook, it should be provided free at the point of use and not be means tested.
The executive's knee-jerk reaction was to reject the costly proposal.
Jack McConnell: Competed for the job
But before Mr McLeish had barely warmed the seat of his first minister's chair, he announced a U-turn on policy.
Scotland's elderly would have the free service, said the new leader, at a cost of �110m per year.
Mr McLeish, to mark his 100th day in power, told the nation: "There has been a lot of dancing on pinheads in relation to this matter..... we are embracing the principles of Sutherland in full."
He had silenced the opposition and his populist move was applauded up and down the country.
But adulation was short lived.
Tricky matter
The announcement reportedly left Labour at Westminster feeling uneasy.
Although Mr McLeish had made a clear decision on a matter devolved to Holyrood it had implications for England and Wales.
The obvious retort was, if Scotland's elderly can get free personal care so should those in the rest of the UK.
Wendy Alexander: Reports of unrest
There was also another tricky matter for Mr McLeish, that of paying for the project.
The executive was hoping part of the cost would be recouped through the �55 a week "attendance allowance" most elderly and infirm people receive from the UK benefits system.
But the Treasury was reported to have flexed its muscles and said it would not allow Scotland to opt out of the UK's unified social security system. Westminster had already been bruised by a student tuition fees deal north of the border and a similar post-devolution problem seemed to have emerged.
Other tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster have been evident during Mr McLeish's tenure.
He stepped in and insisted the executive should be referred to as a "government" after suggestions that it should change its title to avoid confusion with the government at Westminster.
Personal stamp
And, less judiciously, he was overheard making less than flattering remarks about ministerial colleagues Dr John Reid and Brian Wilson during a discussion with Scottish Secretary Helen Liddell after the general election.
McLeish also found himself bunkered when he sought to put his personal stamp on Scotland's 2009 Ryder Cup bid, which was effectively lost to a competitor in Wales.
Scotland was awarded the competition four years later, but the campaign was seen by many as a disaster.
As for Mr McLeish's Cabinet, publicly they had been fairly well behaved.
However, in March this year Mr McLeish was accused of having a lack of control after reports that Enterprise Minister, Wendy Alexander, "threw a tantrum" when she was ordered to take responsibility for water authorities in the wake of Environment Minister Sam Galbraith's resignation.
In the same month, the first minister had to handle the resignation of the Liberal Democrat deputy minister for parliament Tavish Scott.
The MSP went after rebels voted to defeat the Scottish Executive over funding for the fishing industry.
At the time, Mr McLeish admitted fears that the issue might "pose problems" for the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition.
Before events in October and November, March might have been seen as Mr McLeish's toughest month.
But on Thursday the first minister capitulated to calls for his resignation, ending a brief but turbulent period at the top.

Cameron pledges 'positive agenda'
Mr Cameron said he welcomed the challenge of a new Labour leader
Tory leader David Cameron has said he intends to present an "exciting and inspiring" alternative to Labour, amid speculation about a 2008 election.
Mr Cameron said, after ten years in government, he doubted Labour's new leader, Chancellor Gordon Brown, could provide "the change Britain needs".
He said the Tories had moved to the centre ground and he would now focus on a "relentlessly positive agenda". Mr Brown takes over as prime minister from Tony Blair on Wednesday.
In his first speech as party leader on Sunday, Mr Brown appointed Douglas Alexander his election co-ordinator, prompting speculation there may be a general election as early as spring 2008.
Labour challenge
Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was "looking forward to the challenge" of a new Labour leader. "I've got a very important job to do, which is to give the British people an exciting and inspiring alternative to a government that I believe has failed," he said.
"And that's what I am going to focus on, a relentlessly-positive agenda."
Fundamentally we will have a more socially mobile and fairer society if we have stronger families, we will have stronger families if we back marriage
David Cameron
Asked about a newspaper poll suggesting Labour was ahead of the Conservatives, for the first time since October, Mr Cameron said public opinion had been tested at the local elections, where his party won 40% of the vote.
He told the programme there had been three "very big changes" that had to be made to the Conservatives, when he took over as party leader - putting stability ahead of upfront tax cuts, improving the NHS for all rather than opt-outs for the few and expanding opportunity "for all" in education.
Middle ground
"The party has changed - it is in the middle ground, it is challenging for power," he said.
"It is much more relevant to people's concerns today in terms of really fighting the fight on health and education and crime."
He said, in the long term: "Fundamentally we will have a more socially mobile and fairer society if we have stronger families, we will have stronger families if we back marriage."
Mr Cameron said he would work alongside Mr Brown if he did "the right thing", saying the Tories had already supported the government's education bill.
But he said: "There are changes we need and my issue with Gordon Brown is I don't believe he can provide the change Britain needs, not least because he's had ten years in the job to do some of the things on school discipline and on basic standards of education which, just haven't been done, and they badly need doing."

Man City 'eye Spanish teenager'
Manchester City boss Mark Hughes is keen to add to his squad
Espanyol have confirmed that Manchester City are keen to sign their 16-year-old midfielder Joan Angel Roman.But the Spanish side insist the two clubs are still a distance apart in their valuations. "Espanyol are still waiting to receive a satisfactory offer from City for the transfer of Joan Angel Roman," a club statement on their website read. "City must follow Fifa regulations, which stipulate that the clubs must agree for a move to take place." The statement added: "It is reminded that in England a player cannot be a professional until he is 17 years old, which means the only way is an agreement between the clubs."

Zvonareva shocks Ivanovic in Doha
Ivanovic mixed some stunning strokes with some unforced errors
Fourth seed Ana Ivanovic lost for the second time in two days as Russian Vera Zvonareva triumphed 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 in the Tour Championships in Doha.
The Serb, 21 on Thursday, made a slow start and had to be assessed by a doctor after having dizzy spells.
She won the second set after wasting three set points but lost the match.
In Group B, Venus Williams won again, beating Elena Dementieva 6-4 4-6 6-3 and next meets sister Serena, who saw off Dinara Safina 6-4 6-1.
Zvonareva launched a furious outburst as an over-rule went against her in the first game of the decider, but she kept her focus.
Ivanovic played some delightful strokes but was plagued by inconsistency again and now has little chance of progressing, with only two players from each group qualifying for the semi-finals.
She squandered a chance for a commanding lead in the second-set tie-break when Zvonareva did well to return two smashes in a thrilling rally.
But a magnificent cross-court pass created the fourth set point she needed to take the match to a final set.
606: DEBATE
Give your thoughts on Ivanovic's defeat
Zvonareva's frustration with the umpire had a positive impact on her performance, however, and she raced into a 3-0 lead.
The determined eighth seed held on for victory and said: "I managed to win a very tough match against a tough opponent."
Ivanovic said: "I have had a virus, but I don't know why my blood pressure was taken - it frightened me and made me feel worse.
"It was very hard for me to breathe, and I was struggling. I was feeling very dizzy and light headed. So it was very tough. I couldn't eat much for the last couple of days and with the lack of energy, it was a little bit hard.
"It was very disappointing, but I still gave 100% in this match, and she was the better player. I need a miracle to qualify now."
Venus maintained her fine start with a gruelling victory over Olympic champion Elena Dementieva.
Williams, who beat another Russian, world number two Safina, on Tuesday, fought back from 0-2 down in the deciding set to secure the win in two hours 21 minutes.
The American had problems with her serve, however, with a total of 10 double faults, and three times sent down pairs of double faults.
"It was just really competitive out there," the 28-year-old said.
The Wimbledon champion may be able to qualify for the last four even if she loses her final group match against her younger sister.
Safina had no better luck against Serena on Wednesday as the Russian lost in straight sets for the second day running.
