Zimbabwe to seize white-owned land
Minority whites still own bulk of fertile land
The Zimbabwean Government has confirmed it is pushing ahead with plans to take over hundreds of large-scale white-owned farms in a move which has caused near panic among many farmers. Joseph Winter reports from Harare on the farmers' reactionsThe plans to redistribute the farmland to landless black peasants have been characterised by confusion and delay since the second stage of the process was begun nearly a year ago. But the confusion turned to shock among the white farming community when, earlier this week, nearly 850 landowners began to receive letters from the government informing them that their farms had been acquired by the state. Many feared that they could be ordered to leave their land within weeks. Move to allay fears
The Deputy Agriculture Minister, Olivia Muchena, has now tried to allay the worst fears of the farmers, saying an appeals process would be observed and that farmers should continue to plant crops.
She told a news conference in Harare that the letters were merely a technicality issued to prevent the year long process going back to square one. "The government is not grabbing the land as we are operating
within the framework we have agreed on under consultation," she said.
Had the letters not been issued, the minister said, the government would have been forced to begin the whole land programme anew. She said the authorities would act in a fair and transparent manner and that the legal processes would be followed. Leaders of the white commercial farmers who own the majority of Zimbabwe's most fertile land said they were, to some extent, reassured by the deputy minister's comments. The President of the Farmers' Union, Nick Swanopoel, urged his colleagues to continue working the land while discussions with ministers continued. The government also said those villagers who had invaded and illegally occupied some farms around the capital Harare in the past
fortnight must get off the land by Monday or face prosecution.
The squatters moved in after complaining that the land
reform programme was taking too long.
"They must go back home. Government will not allow anybody to resettle themselves, not only here, but anywhere else," said the chairman of the government land acquisition committee, Joseph
Msika.
But our correspondent says the government's failure to consult the farmers or potential international donors, without whom the whole land redistribution programme is unlikely to succeed, has undermined confidence in an already shaky economy.

Amazon's quest for profit
Sales at Amazon aren't growing as strongly as expected
It may be one of the last big internet retailers left standing - but it has never made any money.
As the ranks of online retailers have thinned, Amazon has stayed the course even as its critics foresaw its demise.
Its established brand name and market presence left it better equipped than most to survive last year's dot.com fallout.
Late on Monday, the group said that it remains on track to post a pro-forma operating profit in the fourth quarter. But it is still unclear when it will make a net profit.
When is a profit not a profit?
It can seem that there are as many different ways to define profit as there are to make profit.
Pro-forma operating profit can be defined as profit minus some potential losses such as investments or employee stock options. It is not as stringent a definition as that demanded by standard accountancy practices.
By this definition, Amazon will be in "profit" by the end of the year. We don't have a crystal ball on the economy
Warren Jenson, Amazon chief financial officer
At face value, Monday's results appear strong. The company did post a loss for the 17th quarter in a row, but its pro-forma operating loss narrowed. In the US it has already posted a pro-forma operating profit and it is set to hit break-even by the end of the year in the UK and Germany. "It is a notable achievement in any kind of retailing, to say that a US-based company in the three years after launch can start two new standalone businesses in Europe," Amazon's UK country manager Steve Frazier told BBC News Online.
But crucially, sales aren't growing as fast as expected. What this means is that Amazon.com is being helped on its way to profit by the aggressive cost cutting it has put in place.
It has closed distribution centres, shelved plans for a new corporate headquarters and laid off 15% of its staff.
"We took some fairly dramatic restructuring moves to reduce costs...and we don't have anything like that in mind [in the near future]," Amazon's Steve Frazier said.
Slow sales
But sales are still continuing to disappoint.
In theory, the failure of many internet retailers should have freed up as much as $1bn in online consumer spending that could go to Amazon.
But working against Amazon is the slowing US economy.
Some analysts say the retailer is shifting the same amount of stock, but tighter economic conditions mean that it is selling cheaper items instead.
"There can never be any guarantees. We don't have a crystal ball on the economy," Amazon chief financial officer Warren Jenson admitted.
This difficulty in growing sales has engendered some analyst scepticism.
"Can they make money? Yes. Can they grow the top line? If anything, we're more doubtful about that, " said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "It's hard to say we are not disappointed."
Amazon's Steve Frazier said:"Our sales are still growing...there is some impact of the slowdown in the consumer economy in the US already [factored] into those numbers. Given the state of the economy, we have made choices to drive for profitability rather than pure growth."
Serving retailers
One of the more interesting parts of the Amazon.com earnings release was the performance of its services division.
This division - the company's smallest - grew 41% to $38.6m, enjoying gross margins of 68%. This could mean that Amazon.com could make a hefty amount as a retail services business.
Already, Toys 'R' Us pays Amazon.com a fee to run its online shop. Some suspect similar deals could follow. The deal it recently announced with AOL provides some evidence that this is the direction in which Amazon could be heading.
Under the deal, AOL will use Amazon technology to build an e-commerce offering for AOL customers. AOL chief executive Barry Schuler said: "We are going to partner as much as we can to get the best products and services."
Money to spare?
While Amazon is not expected to see any revenue from this for more than a year, the $100m cash injection from AOL should provide the internet retailer with some useful extra cash.
During the dot.com crash, some industry analysts had predicted that Amazon could run out of money before turning a profit.
The firm denied it then and continues to deny it. It expects to have cash and securities worth $600m at the end of September and worth $900m at the end of the year.

Russia's rusting navy
By Stephen Mulvey
BBC News Online
The Novomoskovsk, whose missiles stuck in its silos last month
The decline of Russia's armed services has been unmistakeable for more than a decade, but it is the crisis in the navy that has been most conspicuous of all.
The declaration from the navy commander-in-chief that the nuclear cruiser Peter the Great is too dangerous to be at sea is only the latest in a string of problems.
The sinking of the Kursk submarine during exercises in 2000, was Russia's worst peacetime military disaster, leading to the death of 118 sailors.
It was followed by the death of nine more men last year when another submarine, K-159, sank as it was being towed to a scrapyard.
The incident graphically illustrated the depth of the navy's problems - Russia is decommissioning warships so fast it does not have the resources to scrap them.
How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted in many units, pilots hardly ever fly and sailors hardly ever put to sea
Vladimir Putin in 2000
The K-159, a model dating back to the 1950s, had been to left to rust for years before it was finally taken away to be dismantled.
Last year, yet another round of naval downsizing was announced - this after 1,000 warships were dumped in the 1990s.
The Russian navy's chief of staff, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, said a fifth of the fleet would be scrapped because the navy received just 12% of the budget it needed to keep the ships seaworthy.
Insufficient training The Kursk disaster was initially blamed on a collision between the Kursk and a foreign submarine in the area, but a two-year investigation pinned the blame on a faulty torpedo.
Was it badly manufactured or badly maintained? Or were the sailors just poorly trained? The investigation did not make this clear.
All were lucky the ICBM did not explode on the sub
Military expert Pavel Felgengauer on a failed missile test in 2004
But Western analysts speculated from the first that the disaster could have been caused by mistakes in handling the liquid fuel the torpedoes use.
And President Putin himself underlined the need for better military training, in the wake of the tragedy.
"How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted in many units, pilots hardly ever fly and sailors hardly ever put to sea?" he asked the Russian Security Council.
Uncomfortable memories of the Kursk disaster were stirred just last month, when Mr Putin himself put to sea to observe a pre-election naval exercise.
A nuclear submarine was to fire two liquid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), but both got stuck in their silos.
The next day, a sister ship succeeded in firing a missile - but it exploded soon after take-off.
"All were lucky the ICBM did not explode on the sub," the military analyst Pavel Felgengauer wrote in his column in the Moscow Times.
Ambitions scaled back
It appears that poor maintenance and training could also be factors behind Admiral Kuroyedov's decision to confine the flagship of the northern fleet, the Peter the Great, to its base for two months.
Here again this Russian habit of relying on mere chance and hoping that everything will work just this time showed itself
Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov on the K-159 accident
He said he was particularly concerned about the state of the on-board nuclear reactor, and he ordered the crew to re-take a military training course before they go back to sea.
A final verdict has yet to be delivered on the K-159 incident, but one theory is that officers failed to follow proper safety procedures.
There have been accusations that the submarine should not have been being towed in rough weather, that it was towed too fast, and that there should not in fact have been any sailors on board the ancient vessel.
"Here again this Russian habit of relying on mere chance and hoping that everything will work just this time showed itself," Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov was quoted as saying.
As the navy has been hit in recent years by one problem after another, it has also scaled back its ambitions.
It now has only one aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, launched in 1989.
The ship was being prepared in 2000 for its first deployment in the Mediterranean since 1997 - a gesture seen in Moscow as an important confirmation of Russia's status as a major world power - when the Kursk disaster struck and the trip was called off.
One Russian military analyst said recently that the Kuznetsov's only remaining purpose seemed to be training naval pilots.
Russia's focus is increasingly on protecting its own territorial waters than patrolling the world's oceans.
Plans for production of new warships are limited to modest frigates and corvettes.
And this year, Russia will finally give up its military base at Cam Ranh, Vietnam, leaving it with just one overseas logistical support base, at Tartus in Syria.
Starvation
Over the last decade Russians have become accustomed to tales of woe emanating from the navy.
In one notorious incident in 1994, four conscripts in the Pacific Fleet died of a stomach infection linked to malnutrition.
In 1995 a nuclear submarine came close to meltdown when an electricity company cut supplies to a naval base in a dispute over unpaid bills, and the submarine's cooling system ceased to function.
And in 1998 a 19-year-old went on the rampage, murdering eight fellow sailors and threatening to blow up the submarine on which he was serving.
Theft also remains endemic.
Russian TV reported last year that warships and submarines of the northern fleet were being routinely robbed of vital components, including telecommunication circuit boards, air regeneration filters and even torpedoes.
It said naval officers were sometimes working together with criminal gangs which made millions of dollars smuggling the loot abroad.

France takes lead role on Lebanon
By William Horsley
European affairs analyst, BBC News
Israel is determined to push Hezbollah back from the border
France is at the centre of intense diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon, in the face of grave risks that the conflict could spread out of control. Does France hold the key to peace in the Middle East? France now has the key role, with the US, in achieving a ceasefire agreement through the UN Security Council. French diplomats speak of the need to take due account of Lebanese and other Arab states' objections to the draft UN resolution, as well as core Israeli demands. They face a painfully hard task to reconcile the wishes of both sides. France's big foreign policy idea also faces its toughest test yet: it is that the US has destabilised the Middle East through its mistakes, like the invasion of Iraq, and that France can do better as the champion of an alternative European strategy. The reputation of French President Jacques Chirac is at stake, too. His dismally low support rating shows signs of improving thanks to recent high-profile French diplomacy. Mr Chirac may hope to score a dramatic international success before next May, when his long political career is expected to end. Success or failure over Lebanon could spell the difference between glory and shame for him and his Gaullist ideas about shaping the world. US challenged
So while the world watches in dismay the latest outbreak of a deep-rooted armed conflict across the Israel-Lebanon border, another long-standing rivalry is being played out from New York to Beirut - the diplomatic struggle between the US and France.
Mr Douste-Blazy played a major role at the Rome talks on Lebanon
The French Foreign Minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, revealed the huge importance Paris attaches to this contest. "An important victory for French diplomacy" is how he described the 1 August agreement by EU foreign ministers to follow the logic of France, calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities. France insisted there could be no military solution to the crisis - so Israel must stop the shooting, as well as Hezbollah. The French also led European protests at what was called Israel's "disproportionate" military response to Hezbollah's provocation. But the Americans, backed by Britain, placed top priority on allowing Israel to severely weaken Hezbollah for its own long-term security - by that logic an early ceasefire should not be imposed on Israeli forces before that goal is achieved. The circumstances of this crisis uniquely favour a central role for France:
France is the former colonial power in Lebanon, and a self-styled "friend of the Arab world"; it is the only Western power to have cultivated close links with Arab governments of all kinds, including the former regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq
America is politically weakened: militarily stretched in Iraq, and widely seen as having lost the moral authority needed to dictate events Britain, the other ex-great power in the region, is seen in the Arab world as compromised by its closeness to the US. It has declined to send troops to a multinational force for Lebanon, leaving France as first choice to lead it.
This could just be a French win-win situation. Their Lebanon diplomacy is helping to mend bruised relations with the Americans. But Mr Douste-Blazy has also openly fuelled the impression that his country is seeking to fulfil an old ambition - to replace US dominance in global affairs with a European alternative led by France. He hailed recent events as proof that "a political Europe exists", and that we live in a "multipolar world" - a phrase much used by President Chirac to challenge American authority in 2003 over the invasion of Iraq. EU support
The active French stance enjoys wide support in the European Union. Many leaders are frustrated or angry about what they see as America's culpable failure to advance the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians - the key element needed for the region's long-term stability.
Most Arab states would also welcome a bigger European say in the region's affairs.
Europe has also offered - yet again - to help rebuild Lebanon once the violence is over. Informally, it is said that France might provide 5,000 troops for a multinational force of around 15,000 in southern Lebanon.
Yet France must also weigh up the acute military and diplomatic risks in taking on the lead role in any outside effort to sort out the Lebanon crisis on the ground:
Peacekeeping: whatever UN resolutions may say about a ceasefire binding on Israel and Hezbollah forces, any peacekeeping mission in Lebanon will be dangerous. France lost 58 paratroopers killed in a suicide bombing in Beirut in 1983, during an earlier attempt to impose order; the US suffered 241 deaths on the same day
Like France, other nations including Turkey, Norway and Italy say any commitment to send troops to Lebanon would be conditional on satisfactory terms. Germany, the largest EU state, is deeply reluctant to send combat-ready troops because of sensitivities towards Israel related to the Nazi-era Holocaust
Syria: France's traditionally strong ties with Damascus may be useless, after the two nations fell out over Syria's alleged role in last year's assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the forced withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Yet without Syrian consent no long-term settlement will be secure Iranian contradictions: France is committed, with the EU and US, to a tough stance towards Iran over its nuclear programme. Yet Iran, as Hezbollah's other main backer, has the power to wreck any agreement and to threaten Israel. The contradiction was plain when the French foreign minister met his Iranian counterpart in Beirut and lauded Iran as a "stabilising force" in the region The French homeland: Mr Chirac says he fears angry Muslim passions over the Middle East may be imported into France itself; that risk would grow if France leads a controversial peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
France has won general praise for being willing to lead efforts to bring peace to Lebanon. But the hardest part still lies ahead.

Have Your Say: Flood insurance
As the flood waters recede in parts of England it has become clear tens of thousands of homes have been affected. The insurance industry says claims related to flood damage will total �1.5bn. We asked if you had made an insurance claim linked to the recent floods and who you thought should foot the bill for the uninusred. This debate is now closed. If taxpayers' money is used to help flood victims, the same percentage should be paid to everyone affected. Those who are properly insured would then receive a payout on their policy, less the government funding. This way those who pay for insurance will not feel unfairly treated, and we will all benefit from the fact that future insurance premiums will not have to rise quite so much as they would do otherwise.Anon A local developer who built on field that was known to flood, and where there was a spring, is now offering to repair the houses that recently flooded. I completely agree with the Nottingham MP on Money Box that developers should have to insure against flood for the 20 years - also maybe personal liability on the council who gave approval.Mike Davis, East Yorkwhire
People who don't bother to buy building insurance should be made to pay back the money that the tax payer lends to them.Jane Woods
If householders wish to spend their money on beer, holidays or plasma tvs that is then their problem. We sensible people should not pay for their stupidity! The government should not allow building on flood plains! Equally stupid! Mike of Swansea
Isn't it amazing that when an uninsured person suffers a loss individually they have to cope on their own but when it's part of a more generalised event then the taxpayer is expected to bail them out? Those who choose the benefits of spending their money on something other than insurance should not expect the taxpayer to pay when things go wrong. Those who buy houses that cannot be insured because of an unacceptable flood risk should have done their homework before the purchase and will also have benefited from the lower price they paid for it in the first place so I'm afraid I don't feel any responsibility to them either. Councils on the other hand probably do need taxpayer assistance to reinstate damage to local infrastructure.A Dell, Glasgow
If you don't live on the top of a hill, then get your home insured
Andrew McCallig, Cumbria
If my car is at the side of the road with no insurance and it's hit by a passing truck then it's my tough luck. if these people have not bothered to insure their property then again it's their tough luck. They knew the risks, global warming is happening and if you don't live on the top of a hill, then get your home insured.Andrew McCallig, Cumbria
I pay house insurance for the risk to my property, not other people's property. Those who have chosen not to have house insurance made that choice. I do not see why I should pay for their property damage. Perhaps the people who should pay are the developers, builders and individual council members who have allowed these properties to be built on flood plains in the first place.SRB, Abergale
I pay just over �300 a year for contents and building insurance. Why should I as a tax paying pensioner - �200 a month tax - pay towards those who didn't bother to take out insurance cover but still can afford cigarettes, drink and bingo?Bob Baker, Clacton On Sea
I spent an austere childhood as my parents made financial sacrifices to pay for a mortgage, insurance and pensions. I lived an austere life as I chose to have a mortgage and insurance and made pension arrangements and now pay not inconsiderable taxes and have no wish to see them diverted to those who have chosen not to suffer such austerity but think that I should subsidise their financial chickens coming home to roost. Anne Wheelhouse, Hawkhurst, Kent
We should show compassion to people facing total ruin
R Harris, London
Whilst some flood victims should have given a higher priority to insuring their property, I believe we should show compassion to people facing total ruin. Let us not forget it is government policies such as immigration that required the vast number of houses to be built on flood plains and it surely follows that it is their duty to ensure the rivers and drains are capable of protecting them. Don't call it an Act of God, it is failed government for which we must all take responsibility.
R Harris, London
Why should the wise pay for the foolish? Their bills will probably be much the same as the premiums paid by the insured over many years.Douglas Cook, Cockermouth, Cumbria
An uninsured house holder in a flood area may get a grant from the flood fund. But would an uninsured house holder get any help if they had similar loses on an individual scale, say a fire in May?Lane, Nottingham
As someone who is fully insured I find the comments by those moaning about people's lack of insurance miserable. Many people cannot afford insurance. Even if they have plasma TVs - so what. They are still deserving of our help. In my experience, insurance companies do anything in their power not to pay out. I have twice had to employ a solicitor to ensure they pay up. People do not have the money to take these companies on. Simon Hutchings, Ottery St Mary
I certainly don't want to have to pay to bail these people out
Judy, Liverpool
It seems to be that we are paying for everyone who makes a dubious decision these days. I don't really feel that flooding is my problem and I certainly don't want to have to pay to bail these people out, although I do feel sorry for them. Perhaps people who live in areas where flooding is going to be a problem should be paying into their own fund to cover costs in such an eventuality. I can see my bank account being raided by the government, yet again, to pay for this and it's not on. Judy, Liverpool
I'm not surprised that some properties are uninsurable. Over the last few decades, building has taken place on plots with too high a risk of flooding and/or subsidence. The most worrying thing though is that this process still continues today.Chris Grey, Guildford
I for one am heartily tired of people who chose not to insure their goods now implying it is someone else's fault and that someone else (ie the taxpayer) should bail them out. I would be pretty sure they all have all the usual expensive goods, and large TVs, DVDs and stereos etc. Everyone regards these things as essential but not all want to pay the premiums to insure them. Well those of us who pay insurance should not have to bail out those who chose not to. Rob Bacon, London
As someone who lost their roof in the Birmingham tornado, I felt very lucky in having the insurers agree to a new roof fairly quickly (within three weeks). However, we had to live in the house for over six months from July to January with tarpaulin for a roof, winds whistling through and further damage from rain and the work (ceilings collapsing in the bedrooms and bathroom). The insurers eventually paid �63,000 out of a total bill approaching �72,000, so we were �9,000 out-of-pocket in addition to the stress of living in a building site. But we still counted ourselves lucky compared to many of our neighbours who had insurers dragging out assessments, builders who did shoddy work, and landlords with no insurance.Mike Cummins, Birmingham

Nuclear waste site deal is struck
The Drigg nuclear waste site is over 40 years old
A deal worth up to �500m has been agreed to manage low-level nuclear waste at the Drigg site in Cumbria.
Nuclear Waste Management Ltd (UKNWM) has been given the contract after promising �100m in savings by introducing new technologies.
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) spent two years considering the five-year contract for the 6km site, which is south of Sellafield.
Drigg contains waste from nuclear facilities, universities and hospitals.
Further extension
Dr Ian Roxburgh, NDA chief executive officer, said: "This is a landmark occasion for many reasons.
"Primarily it is significant because it is through the competition process that we will bring innovation and new expertise to the programme to decommission and clean-up the UK's nuclear legacy. "It is equally important as it means the NDA has delivered the first in a series of multi-million pound competitions."
The initial contract is for a period of five years with the potential of further extension periods, subject to performance and NDA management approval, up to a total of 17 years. Dick Raaz, managing director of UKNWM, said: "UKNWM brings together a group of companies with world-beating experience in nuclear waste management. "We believe that in partnership with the NDA, we can make a real difference."
