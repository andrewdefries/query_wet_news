M&S 'confident' in Luc
Vandevelde: the M&S job 'a bit more difficult' than he thought
Troubled UK retailer Marks & Spencer on Sunday evening leapt to the defence of its chairman Luc Vandevelde, following reports in the Sunday papers that he might be under pressure to give up his �810,000 bonus.
"We all want what is best for the company and believe Luc is the man to do the job," said Kevin Lomax, a non-executive director on the remuneration committee of the retailer.
"Arrangements regarding the chairman's bonus have not been finalised," he said.
The Sunday Business reported that M&S non-executive directors were furious that Mr Vandevelde has not volunteered to waive his right to the bonus.
They will now insist that he does, given the company's 'dire performance' said the paper.
The Observer quoted a 'source' close to the board saying: "The chances that he will get this bonus are zero." 'Not approved yet'
But Louis Hill, a spokesman for M&S, told BBC News Online on Sunday that so far the issue of a bonus for Mr Vandevelde had not been up for discussion.
"We've never said Luc is getting a bonus, we've never said he isn't," the spokesman said.
"Any bonus he gets will have to be approved by the remuneration committee which will meet twice between now and 22 May," he added.
The remuneration committee, headed by the former chief of M15 Dame Stella Rimington, comprises mainly of non-executive directors whose remit is to approve executive pay and bonuses.
If approved by the committee, Mr Vandevelde can receive a bonus of up to 100% of his salary of �650,000.
A store in trouble
Last month, M&S said that it was to close all its overseas stores in a bid to halt falling sales and profits at its core UK operations. The overhaul would affect 5,000 jobs, the vast majority of which are in continental Europe. M&S also announced a new image change for its UK stores, with an expansion of areas such as homewares, foods and beauty.
Mr Vandevelde has given himself until the end of the year to begin the revival in the store's fortunes.
M&S share prices have plunged since the company's troubles began.
They closed on Friday at 276p, from a high of 664p in October 1997, which came in the days when the store's profits topped �1bn.
Though, at 276p, they are still comfortably off their low-point of 170p in October 2000.

US to be 'pragmatic on climate'
By Roger Harrabin
BBC environment analyst, Bonn
Lights go out in New York during last weekend's call to action on climate change
The US must balance science with what is politically and technologically achievable on climate change, America's lead negotiator has said. Speaking at UN talks in Bonn, Jonathan Pershing said the US must not offer more than it could deliver by 2020. Poor countries said the latest science showed rich states should cut emissions by 40% on 1990 levels by 2020. President Barack Obama's plan merely to stabilise greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by 2020 is much less ambitious. Mr Pershing, the US delegation head, previously spent many years promoting clean energy for the International Energy Agency and at the Washington think-tank WRI - World Resources Institute. 'Pragmatic' approach He told the BBC he was very worried the Earth might already be committed to dangerous climate change. But he said the US should not make promises for 2020 that it could not keep: "It is not the point in time in 2020 that matters - it is a long-term trajectory against which the science measures cumulative emissions.
There is still much negotiation to be done between now and December
"The president has also announced his intent to pursue an 80% reduction by 2050. "It is clear that the less we do in the near-term, the more we have to do in the long-term. But if we set a target that is un-meetable technically, or we can't pass it politically, then we're in the same position we are in now where the world looks to us and we are out of the regime. "We want to be in (the regime), we want to be pragmatic, we want to look at the science. There is a small window of where they overlap. We hope to find it." This is a radical change of tone and content from the Bush administration which envisaged that emissions would continue to grow to 2025. Technology fund
When asked if the Obama team would be able to improve its offer further before the crucial Copenhagen talks in December that will attempt to produce a new climate treaty, Mr Pershing said: "I don't know". It would depend on the level of domestic political resistance in Congress and the amount of progress on technology policies.
The US has a key role to play in developing clean technologies
Mr Pershing did promise that the US would help poor countries to fund clean technology. He would not mention figures but he hinted the sums would be much less than many developing countries demanded. "The notion that the USA would transfer funds to pay for the entirety of the world's development is implausible. The characterisation often made in these meetings [from developing countries] is that we will only do actions that are paid for. That's a limited vision and we'd like to turn that round." He said the best role for governments would be to incentivise the private sector to develop energy efficiency, clean technologies and reduce deforestation. He said China did not want money for technology from the USA but co-operation on technology development. Small steps
Negotiators from China, India and Papua (representing vulnerable states) all told BBC News that the US and other rich nations needed to cut emissions much harder and offer concrete funding. Surya Sethi from India said: "Progress is extremely slow. Rich nations seem to think that developing countries can help the world out of the climate problem. But the poorest 50% have just 11% of emissions. "It is crystal clear that the answer is for the United States and other rich nations to change their lifestyles and their methods of production and consumption. We do not see any real evidence that they have grasped that issue properly yet." One European delegate said: "We are in a dilemma. We want to support Obama - we know he has political difficulties. But we want him to know he has to do more." The current talks in the German city are not expected to produce a substantial step forward, except perhaps on limited measures over land use and forestry. Delegates are frustrated there will be no negotiating text until the next meeting in Bonn in June. So much work remains that the UN is planning two extra preparatory meetings before Copenhagen. Mr Pershing expressed cautious optimism that the framework for a legally binding deal might emerge by December, although he said some details might take longer to be settled. There was an energy behind the issue in the United States that he had never previously witnessed, he said.

Twigg facing a month out injured
Oxford United striker Gary Twigg will be out for more than a month following ankle surgery.
Twigg, 23, had looked to have shaken off an ankle problem before being injured again on Sunday and he will now have an operation next week.
"It's a blow but it's better to get it sorted and get Gary playing again sooner rather than later," U's boss Jim Smith told his club's website.
Oxford have also lost the services of Marvin Robinson and Paul Shaw.

Canada win thrilling final gold of Winter Olympics
Canada snatch hockey gold in overtime
Sidney Crosby's extra-time goal secured Canada the final gold medal of the Games, sealing a dramatic 3-2 win over the United States in men's ice hockey.The gold medal was Canada's 14th of the Games, a record, and fittingly the milestone medal was the one many Canadians coveted above all others. For Canada, who last won this event in 2002, the win avenged the 5-3 defeat by the US in their round robin match. The win was an ice hockey double after the women's team beat the US 2-0. The men's final could have been more straightforward but a series of missed opportunities allowed the US to set up the tense extra period. The host nation went ahead when Jonathan Toews squeezed in his close-range effort from a tight angle before Corey Perry doubled the lead.
It doesn't feel real; it feels like a dream, it just feels like dream
Sidney Crosby
The US hit back through Ryan Kesler and with 24 seconds remaining Zach Parise's slotted finish forced extra time. Crosby, Canada's most high-profile player, had earlier spurned a glorious opportunity to put Canada clear when clean through. But finally the moment came to prove why he is the top scorer in North America's National Hockey League and a Canadian superstar. With a near 18,000 capacity crowd at the Canada Hockey Place watching on nervously the 22-year-old seized his opportunity. Crosby swiped a wrist shot past US net minder Ryan Miller to hand Canada the fairytale ending to the Games. "It doesn't feel real; it feels like a dream, it just feels like dream," said Crosby. "Our team worked so unbelievably hard. This was really tough, especially when they got the goal late in regulation. But we came out in overtime and this is just an unbelievable feeling." Canadian coach Mike Babcock added: "To do it at home with these guys is special. "Our guys did a great job and to win in overtime in Canada, it is a dream come true." Forward Patrick Marleau said: "It is unbelievable. I have never felt something like this before. As far as hockey goes it is the best moment I have ever had." The defeat was the US team's first of their Olympic campaign and defenceman Jack Johnson said: "We were one goal shy of a gold medal. "It is the biggest game any of us have ever played in. Nothing we did before compares to this. You lose the silver you don't win it." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?
