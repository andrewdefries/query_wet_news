S Leone fury at 'forced adoption'
Thousands of children were forced to flee during the civil war
A group of parents in Sierra Leone has accused a charity of sending more than 30 children abroad for adoption without consent during the country's civil war.The parents say they have no idea what happened to their children after they were handed over to Help a Needy Child International (Hanci). But the charity says it has documents signed by the parents giving permission for overseas adoption. Sierra Leone was devastated by a decade of civil war, which ended in 2002. Children were frequently abducted and forced to fight in the brutal conflict. 'Convoluted issue'The BBC's Umaru Fofana, in the capital Freetown, says the parents have been lobbying the government for years to find out what happened to their children. He says they have become frustrated with what they see as a lack of action from ministers, so have taken their campaign to the media. So many years have elapsed so I have to take my time to look at it very carefully
Soccoh KabbiaMinister of children's affairs
One parent told our correspondent how she agreed to let Hanci care for and educate her children at a local centre to save them from the war. "We regularly visited our children at the centre until some time in 1998 when we stopped seeing them," she said. "We went to Freetown to find out what had happened, and we were told they had sent our children overseas and they would be visiting us every five years. "We want the government to intervene and let us have our children back." The parents of more than 30 children make similar allegations. But Hanci director Roland Kargbo denies the claims, saying the charity obtained written consent from the parents whose children were sent overseas. "There were two agreements - one for children to be cared for and reintegrated into the community locally, and another for parents who wanted their children to be adopted," he told the BBC. "The parents know that, we have documents to support that." Minister of Children's Affairs Soccoh Kabbia says the government is still investigating the issue. "It is a convoluted story because so many years have elapsed so I have to take my time to look at it very carefully," he said. The children are believed to have been adopted by American families.

Subway cheers Bangkok commuters
By Tony Cheng
BBC News, Bangkok
Bangkok's main roads are often packed with traffic
The early morning rush hour is not a good time to be out and about in Bangkok.
The roads are jammed and irritated faces glare out from behind the wheels of cars, buses and taxis, all struck in the heavy traffic. But on Monday the traffic seemed a little lighter, and the commuters on foot even seemed to have a spring in their step. For many in this vast sprawling metropolis, the morning commute has just become much easier - thanks to Bangkok's new subway system.
Opened on Saturday by Thailand's revered King Bhumipol Adulyadej, more than 200,000 curious passengers travelled on the 32 km of underground network over the weekend. Overall we've had a very favourable response
Chairman of the MRTA, Prapat Chongsanguan
But the real test came on Monday, when the crowds of morning commuters tried out the new system.
"It's great," said Wallaya. "It used to take me more than an hour to get to work. Today the journey only took 30 minutes, and I had to queue at the ticket office for quite a long time. It's going to mean I can spend longer in bed!"
Security guard Wattana was equally impressed.
"Normally I travel on the bus, and it takes at least half an hour, even though I don't live very far from here. Today it took about 10 minutes."
'Legendary congestion'
It is not just a question of speed. Many Bangkokians are impressed by the slick stations, the German-engineered trains and the banks of escalators carrying passengers into the bowels of the city.
Commuters say the new subway is fast and efficient
"It's much easier than the Skytrain," said businessman Steve, referring to the city's other major public transport network. "I can take my son to school and we don't have to climb up all the stairs. The escalators make things much more convenient," he said.
The metro runs in a semi-circle from the north to the south of the city. Although the 18 stations on its route are still out of reach for many people who live in Bangkok's suburbs, the network penetrates much further than the above-ground Skytrain, which only runs through the city's business district.
There are also plans to extend the metro network to reach more commuters.
The authorities plan to build another 60km of tunnels within the next six years, which the government hopes will cut Bangkok's legendary traffic congestion by 50%.
Idle
The Chairman of the MRTA ( Mass Rapid Transport Authority), Prapat Chongsanguan, is optimistic about the future of the network.
Not everyone will benefit from the new subway
"We've had a few problems, and we need to educate the public about how to use the ticket tokens, but overall we've had a very favourable response from people," he said.
"I think the big test will come in a month's time, when the proper ticket prices are introduced. "When the price goes up to 30 baht (75 cents) per journey, we will get a true reflection of how many passengers are really using the system."
But not everyone was thrilled with the new subway network.
Just outside Saladaeng interchange station, a rank of motorcycle taxis stood idle. The drivers, who would normally be winding through the traffic, were chatting about Sunday's Euro 2004 football final.
And another Bangkok institution might be under threat.
"I haven't had a fare all morning", complained Somchai, as he sat in his colourful Tuk-Tuk.
"If this goes on, I'll have to look for another job.
"Or maybe I should just move to another city."

Purple tomato 'may boost health'
The tomatoes are full of a beneficial pigment
Scientists have developed purple tomatoes which they hope may be able to keep cancer at bay.
The fruit are rich in an antioxidant pigment called anthocyanin which is thought to have anti-cancer properties.
A team from the John Innes Centre, Norwich, created the tomatoes by incorporating genes from the snapdragon flower, which is high in anthocyanin.
The study, published in Nature Biotechnology, found mice who ate the tomatoes lived longer.
This offers the potential to promote health through diet by reducing the impact of chronic disease
Professor Cathie MartinJohn Innes Centre
Anthocyanins, found in particularly high levels in berries such as blackberry, cranberry and chokeberry, have been shown to help significantly slow the growth of colon cancer cells.
They are also thought to offer protection against cardiovascular disease and age-related degenerative diseases.
There is also evidence that the pigments have anti-inflammatory properties, help boost eyesight, and may help stave off obesity and diabetes.
The John Innes team is investigating ways to increase the levels of health-promoting compounds in more commonly eaten fruits and vegetables.
Tomatoes already contain high levels of beneficial antioxidant compounds, such as lycopene and flavonoids.
More benefit
Professor Cathie Martin, from the centre, said: "Most people do not eat five portions of fruits and vegetables a day, but they can get more benefit from those they do eat if common fruit and veg can be developed that are higher in bioactive compounds."
It is too early to say whether anthocyanins obtained through diet could help to reduce the risk of cancer
Dr Lara BennettCancer Research UK
The John Innes team took two genes from snapdragon that induce the production of anthocyanins in snapdragon flowers, and turned them on in tomato fruit.
Anthocyanins accumulated in tomatoes at higher levels than anything previously achieved in both the peel and flesh of the fruit, giving them an intense purple colour.
Tests on mice bred to be susceptible to cancer showed that animals whose diets were supplemented with the purple tomatoes had a significantly longer lifespan compared to those who received only normal red tomatoes.
Professor Martin said: "This is one of the first examples of metabolic engineering that offers the potential to promote health through diet by reducing the impact of chronic disease.
"And certainly the first example of a GMO [genetically modified organism] with a trait that really offers a potential benefit for all consumers."
She said the the next step would be test the tomatoes on human volunteers.
Exciting
Dr Lara Bennett, of the charity Cancer Research UK, said: "It is exciting to see new techniques that could potentially make healthy foods even better for us.
"But it is too early to say whether anthocyanins obtained through diet could help to reduce the risk of cancer.
"We do know that eating a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in fibre, fruit and vegetables - and low in red and processed meat - is an important way to reduce your cancer risk."
Dr Paul Kroon, of the Food Research Institute in Norwich, said the research was an "important study".
"The technology offers great scope for altering colours of fruits and vegetables, and their content of potentially health-protective compounds."
However, he said it would be wrong to assume the effects seen in mice would necessarily occur in humans.
Anna Denny, a nutrition scientist for the British Nutrition Foundation, stressed there was no "magic bullet" against diseases such as cancer and heart disease.
"Fruit and veg with higher levels of health-promoting compounds should not been seen as a replacement for eating a healthy balanced diet."

Smear test age 'to be reviewed'
Cervical screening saves around 4,500 lives every year
Ministers are to review the age at which women in England are screened for cervical cancer.
An expert panel will report later this year on whether women aged 20-24 should be offered smear tests, as they are in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In 2003, screening in England was moved to start at 25 as it was felt it did more harm than good in younger women.
There have been calls to lower screening age following the high-profile case of Jade Goody.
The reality TV star, 27, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year, has been told she has just weeks to live after the disease spread to her liver, groin and bowel.
It is important that we look at any emerging evidence so that we can be sure, and can assure young women, that this is still what is best for their health
Professor Mike Richards, National Cancer Director
Doctors have reported more women asking for smear tests after her diagnosis.
Under-25s have been excluded from such checks in England since 2003 because of relatively few cancers being detected, and concerns about unnecessary and invasive treatments.
This is not the first time the screening age in England has been questioned since the recommendations changed.
In 2008, UK researchers found the incidence of high-grade pre-cancerous lesions was increasing in younger women, prompting them to call for screening to be offered from the age of 20.
Evidence
The expert panel will review the latest evidence to determine whether women under 25 should be eligible for smear tests, health minister Ann Keen said.
They will look at trends in cervical cancer incidence in young women as well as the potential impact of HPV vaccination, which protects against a virus known to cause the majority of cervical cancers, on future rates of the disease.
Options being considered are whether asymptomatic women under 25 years should have formal access to cervical screening or through an "informed choice" scheme.
"Cervical screening saves around 4,500 lives every year and we want to ensure that our programme remains in the best interests of young women," Ann Keen said.
"Experts will review the latest available evidence in this area as well as consider how we can increase awareness of the importance of screening and encourage more women to decide to take up this important service."
Professor Mike Richards, National Cancer Director, added: "Currently in England we start to screen at 25 years, which is in line with international World Health Organization recommendations and is supported by leading scientists in this country.
"However it is important that we look at any emerging evidence so that we can be sure, and can assure young women, that this is still what is best for their health."
Emily James, spokeswoman for Marie Stopes International, said they wanted to see cervical screening standardised across the NHS in the UK.
"Cervical cancer, whilst rare for women under the age of 30, is a potential threat.
"Early detection and treatment can prevent around 75% of cervical cancers developing in women, so an about-turn from the government to offer screening from a younger age could save lives."
Dr Lesley Walker, Cancer Research UK's director of cancer information, said: "It's vital to consider any evidence that might suggest it's more appropriate to screen women under the age of 25 in England.
"The complexities of running a national screening programme mean that there are always hard decisions to make.
"So the evidence needs to be constantly reviewed, and acted upon, as it emerges."
Robert Music, director of Jo's Trust, the cervical cancer charity said: "It is vital that the review goes as wide and deep as possible to ensure many people are able to offer input."

LATEST ACTION AS IT HAPPENS (ALL TIMES BST)
By the BBC Sport team at Wimbledon
606: DEBATE
Your thoughts on day five
To get involved text our Wimbledon team on 81111 or use 606
2054: Roddick wraps up victory in the tie-break and coach Jimmy Connors looks mighty relieved. That's your lot for tonight. It's been a day of shocks - wonder what tomorrow has in store. See you back here bright and early.
2040: The Roddick match is into a tie-break. It's the only singles match still going on.
2040: Roddick faces a set point but manages to save it. He's obviously keen to finish off Verdsaco tonight. Maybe he is planning a big Friday night out - having to come back tomorrow to play would put a spanner in that plan.
2033: Andy Roddick is making hard work of his match on Court One. The third seed took the first two sets but went a break down in the third. However, he's just broken his opponent Fernando Verdasco so it's 4-5 on serve. More good news for British doubles - Alex Bogdanovic and Melanie South have just beaten Benjamin Becker and Anna-Lena Groenfeld in the mixed doubles first round.
2018:
"The way he celebrated at the end shows what that win meant to Federer. I think he realised that playing against Safin was very dangerous. He was happy to get through it and played extremely well."
BBC Sport's Tracy Austin
2014: Absolute class from Federer in the tie-break as he pummels Safin with some magnificent serves and lashing groundstrokes. He jumps up and down - for a second - salutes the crowd and that wraps up Centre Court for Friday.
Federer beats Safin 6-1 6-4 7-6 (7-4)
2008: Here we go. Safin lets out a huge roar as he fails to make any inroads into Federer's serve. And it's a tie-break in the third.
2000: Jankovic delivers some bad news to doubles partner Jamie Murray, scotching rumours she fancies him.
"It was the funniest thing that I've heard lately, somebody said they'd heard on the BBC that I have a sweet spot for Jamie Murray, and I said, where did they get that from? If I don't really know the guy, how can I like him or how can I have a ... and just to confirm that, it's not true."
We think she should be so lucky. He's a lovely, young man with a good sense of humour, prospects and sexy accent.
1954: Safin is holding his own out there, surely we're not going to see a late rally? Here's what Mc reckons:
"Safin has got his focus now, and he has got to keep that and concentrate on every shot" BBC Sport's John McEnroe
1945: "Three gongs for Tsonga, on to the 4th round on a wild card and 1st time in Wimbledon."
Via text Here on the live we like to say, let's all do the Tsonga, la-la-la-lah ... or maybe not.
1930: Federer is really steamrolling through his match now. He has taken the second set 6-4 with 57 minutes on the clock. Tsonga beats Lopez 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-3
Hantuchova beats Srebotnik 2-6 6-3 6-4
1925: Update from the Mole! "Just spent an hour stuck on a broken train in a tunnel in 45C heat on the Victoria line. Missed 16 overs of the cricket. A RAGING sweaty and hacked off Mole."
1920: Safin got a sniff at Federer in the second set taking an early break, but the Fed Express (did I really write that?) has broken twice to take a 4-3 lead.
Gasquet beats Roger-Vasselin 6-3 6-4 6-2.
1913: "Has Moley knocked off early? Doesn't he know his adoring public are waiting with bated breath 4 his next words of wisdom?"
Sad person in Cornwall The Mole has gone to dig up some dirt at the Oval - and before you ask, no it's not Ben Dirs.
1906: "It's all been a bit pants for us at Wimbledon today - blue pants in particular. Dmitry Tursunov and Tommy Haas dazzled us on Court Two as both of them were wearing blue pants under their tight white shorts."
Charlotte and Michelle recovering with Pimms on Henman Hill
1858: And, as if there wasn't enough happening Federer has taken the first set from Safin 6-1, and he looks pretty unflappable out there.
1854:
The Brits are on the up! The lovely Jamie Murray and his American partner Eric Butorac have only gone and seen off the seventh seeds in the men's doubles to make it through to the second round. "Stretch and Booty" beat Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel 3-6 6-4 6-3 6-4.
1850: Ok folks. Quite a lot happening on the grass, good old Federer has broken Safin to take a 4-1 lead on Centre Court. James Blake is another top 10 player to fall at Wimbledon, the American was ousted by Juan Carlos Ferrero, who won 3-6 6-3 6-3 7-6 (7-4). And former champion Martina Hingis is also a goner, losing to American Laura Granville 6-4 6-2.
1845: Martina Hingis fails to take advantage of four break points in the sixth game of the second set and now trails 4-2 against G-g-g-Granville.
1841: Incidentally, for the lowdown on Federer v Safin, your host will be Sam Lyon.
Live - Federer v Safin
1838: Marat Safin gets to deuce on Roger Federer's opening service game. Let's hope that's not as close as he gets to the four-times champ.
1833: The Swiss Miss trails by a break in the second set against G-g-g-Granville. Looks like the injuries are catching up on the former world number one.
1829: "This has been one of the best days of grand slam tennis in a long time."kim & rafa fan on 606
Join the debate on 606
1826: Huge cheers on Centre Court - were they of relief I wonder? - as Roger Federer and Marat Safin emerge from the locker room. Fasten your seatbelts, folks. 1823: Tell you what, forget Andy, there's a new Murray in town. Jamie and Eric Butorac are now two sets to one up against seventh seeds Jon Erlich and Andy Ram.
1822: "I don't think Martina wants to be out here this afternoon. I don't think she is happy with anything."BBC Sport's Virginia Wade
1819: Serena Williams does a job for the Federer/Safin fans - destroying Milagros Sequera in 44 minutes. The BBC's Sir Tom Fordyce, a Centre Court ticket-holder today, is still trying to coax Mama Fordyce out of the Pimms tent.
1817: After four days of practically nothing, we could have three shocks on our hands today. Martina Hingis drops the first set against G-g-g-Granville. Blake and Ferrero still on serve in the fourth. 1815: "My family could buy two kilos of carrotts with my father's wages when I was growing up."Janko Tipsarevic, conqueror of Fernando Gonzalez
1811: "Apart from a couple of bad games on his own serve, Ferrero is looking in control. Blake won the first set by playing cleverly but he is getting frustrated. He needs to find Plan B but I have not seen that from him yet."
BBC Sport expert Pat Cash
1808: "We don't have one grass court in the country. We have five carpet courts, everything else is clay. How is it possible we have such good players now? I really don't know."Janko Tipsarevic on the success of Serbian tennis
1805: Serena wraps up the first set 6-1. Milagros needs several miracles here. I've been waiting to use that one (check your Spanish dictionary).
1801: "I think Hingis is really struggling here - almost like she can't release her back and legs."BBC Sport's Sam Smith
1757: Juan Carlos Ferrero takes a two sets to one lead against James Blake. Martina Hingis is in a bit of a struggle against Laura G-g-g-Granville (check your Ronnie Barker sitcoms if that didn't mean anything to you) - down a break in the first set.
1750: (hums National Anthem) Heroic stuff from Jamie Murray and Eric Butorac. The British/American pairing level up at one set all against seventh seeds Andy Ram and Jon Erlich. James Auckland and Aussie partner Stephen Huss are a set down against fifth seeds Damm/Paes but it's a very tight tussle.
1744: Blimey, we could be in for another shock over on Court 1. The Mosquito takes a 4-1 lead over ninth seed James Blake in the third set.
1743: "Serena's got too much power for Sequera on grass."BBC Sport's Martina Navratilova as Serena takes a 2-0 lead
1729: Juan Carlos 'Mosquito' Ferrero levels at one set all against James Blake as Ivan Ljubicic joins Fernando Gonzalez in exiting the tournament. The Croat is sunk in four sets by Paul-Henri Mathieu.
1723: "Quite simply, the biggest and best win of Tipsarevic's career so far. Unbelievable."BBC Sport's Greg Rusedski
1720: Finally! And I say that as a Janko Tipsarevic fan, not someone desperate to see Safin and Federer take to the court. Tipsarevic is the new darling of Centre Court as he gets a standing ovation for knocking out fifth seed Fernando Gonzalez 6-3 3-6 6-3 4-6 8-6.
1718: British tragedy all over the place. Jamie Murray and Eric Butorac lose the first set against Ram/Erlich. Murray and Jelena Jankovic won't be in mixed doubles action today either as theirs is one of several matches to be cancelled as a result of the earlier downpours. Match point Tipsarevic.
1715: "Fyrstenberg and Kubot are the 16th seeds, ranked 16 in the world the Brits didn't do that badly."Via text on 81111 OK, fair enough. I take it back. A bit.
1711: "Blake has had less of his first serves in but he has been more effective and is disrupting Ferrero's rhythm.
Ferrero is not winning many points on his second serve. He has had his chances in that first set but did not take them."
BBC Sport expert Pat Cash as James Blake wins the first set against Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-3
1704: Jamie Baker and Alex Bogdanovic exit the men's doubles to Polish pair Fyrstenberg and Kubot. I don't even know their first names and frankly I'm so disgusted at the Brits' lame effort, I'm not even going to look them up. Ha.
1701: "The rally of the match and probably the rally of the tournament. What a story this is turning out to be."BBC Sport's Greg Rusedski as Tipsarevic breaks Gonzalez. Clearly loving this a bit more than the rest of us.
1658: We love a plucky unseeded Serb as much as the next person, but honestly... Serena, Federer and Safin are twiddling their thumbs in the locker room while Tipso and Gonzo battle it out. And it's Friday night. Still, good on Tipso - he's back on serve at 4-5.
1651: Jamie Murray and Eric Butorac have a difficult task against seventh seeds Jon Erlich and Andy Ram today. They're on serve though at the start of the first set. Meanwhile, Brit pair Alex Bogdanovic and Jamie Baker are teetering on the brink of defeat against Fyrstenberg/Kubot of Poland.
1648: "Henman rock 'n' roll (see poll)? I don't think so! If tennis players were musical acts Tim would be Enya!"via text on 81111
1643: Gonzo breaks to lead 4-2 and it doesn't look good for Tipsarevic now. Over on Court 3, Ivan 'Ljubo' Ljubicic is in trouble against Paul-Henri Mathieu, two sets to one down. James Blake and Juan Carlos Ferrero are 2-2.
1634: Gonzo's back on track against Tipso - it's two apiece in set five. A very entertaining affair this may be - but it is delaying Serena and the big one: Federer v Safin.
1624: "Experience, confidence and closing out matches on a more consistent basis made the difference for Jankovic. Safarova should not hang her head though, she tested Jankovic to the limit."BBC Sport expert Tracy Austin
1622: Third seed Jelena Jankovic escapes into round four - eventually seeing off Lucie Safarova 5-7 7-6 6-2. "That was the match of the women's championship so far," says BBC Five Live commentator Iain Carter.
1621: Almost got to use the tantrum graphic then - criminally underused at this tournament so far. Gonzo is broken at the start of the final set and fakes as if to smash a ball out of the stadium before thinking better of it.
1620: "All you Mole fans out there (Hi Mum) that are wondering why there haven't been any updates from the world of TV, it is because Sarah Holt has taken umbrage at me revealing that she is a bit of a weirdo when it comes to hanging round tennis players and won't publish anything of mine. Petty Holt, very petty� "BBC Sport's TV Mole Don't worry Moley, Sarah's gone now
1614: Gonzo conjured up three set points against Tipso and all of a sudden we're into a decider. "It could go either way," says a BBC Sport colleague. Indeed.
1613: "Don't know about rock stars but Moya definitely had a Kurt Russell (circa Escape from New York) thing going on against Henman."Andy via text on 81111
1607: "My money's on Jankovic. In the long run she will prove to be the fitter of the two."BBC Five Live's Judy Murray. Jankovic leads 3-2 the third set
1553: Here on Centre Court then Tipsarevic is serving at 3-2 down in the fourth, though he leads Gonzalez by two sets to one. Here's what Greg thinks: "It will be interesting to see if Gonzalez emerges from that break with new, aggressive tactics. If he doesn't, I'll be shocked."
BBC Sport's Greg Rusedski
1550: And Gonzo might have started it all but look who's snuck up on the rails for the "most rock n' roll tennis player" vote? Marat Safin gets your vote with 36%, followed by Baghdatis, with Tim "Tiger" Henman third and poor old Gonzo trailing in last. A fix.
1545:
Here's some good news for those of you who actually prefer the tennis to drizzle (craziness I say), the sun and the players are out on Centre - and it looks like better weather is on the way too.
1533: The covers are off on Centre. No sign of the players yet though. But never mind that, how's the vote going? Ooh look Marat Safin, who was a bit of a late entry to the list to be fair, is storming into an early lead, surely not with those trim locks?
1530: "Is it me or does Gonzalez look very much like Nick Cave?" Mike Jones via text. Mr Jones, you have only gone and asked for it haven't you? It's time for a vote! Who is the most rock n' roll tennis player?
1518: Few spots of rain on Centre and that's it the covers are coming on. Play suspended. Just when it was getting exciting too. Rubbish. The weatherman here reckons it will just be a brief shower though.
1513: "Safarova v Jankovic might just be the best women's tennis match that I have seen in years. Every point is a marathon including about 5 (should-be) winners. Amazing!"
Kim and Rafa fan on 606
There's more to come too as Jankovic has levelled the match, taking the second set 7-6, squeezing through 7-4 on the tie-break. "There is nothing between Jankovic and Safarova, it is a matter of who flinches first. We have seen some real high-quality tennis." BBC TV's Tracy Austin.
1500: Gonzo has taken a lengthy rest break after losing the third set 6-3 to Tipsarevic. Those tactics certainly helped Feliciano Lopez against one certain Mr Henman.
1456: "Looks like there are some fascinating ladies singles in progress - please, please, please keep us updated on them! Kathryn, via text Ok then. The Swiss 15th seed Patty Schnyder came through a close battle with Kateryna Bondarenko to win 6-4 3-6 8-6. Jankovic is still fighting out there - the seventh game of the second set against Safarova lasted 20 minutes!
1453:
It's all go here. "This is now a real test of character for Jankovic. She is going to be feeling all the pressure being the number three seed."BBC TV's Tracy Austin after Jankovic loses a marathon game to go a set and 4-3 down against Lucie Safarova. 1450: "Any star spotters amongst you should get down to the Aorangi practices court right now! Safin, Rafa, Venus, Sharapova and, er, Youzhny are all down here. Shazza's hitting partner is an aging, bald man in a tatty yellow t-shirt, but he's hit two winners past the Russian - much to her annoyance."
BBC Sport's Caroline Cheese.
1441:
Ooh-er Gonzo throws his racquet to the ground after losing a point, and a ball boy is dispatched to collect it. No wonder the big man is upset, he's 5-2 down in the third. 1429: Er, no. Doherty wins the vote for the person you'd least like to teach your children tennis by 61%. Interestingly, Winehouse and Tarby tied for second while Grace Jones's 10% of votes, must surely mean you wouldn't mind the Slave to the Rhythm icon teaching your kids how to serve then.
1423: Can you stop a Pete Doherty landslide in the vote? Two minutes left!
1415: Gonzo has levelled it on Centre Court. The Chilean fifth seed pounded down some big serves to take the second set 6-3. Here's what Greg thinks, who by the way doesn't fancy copying Tipsarevic and getting a tat done.
"This is the best we've seen Gonzalez play in the Championships so far. He had a tricky few moments in the early stages that he did well to battle through, but now he's really finding his 'A' game." BBC Sport's Greg Rusedski.
1407:
"WHERE IS WINEHOUSE?! There are kids in floods of tears (see 0945 entry). This just isn't on. Who on earth does she think she is behaving like this? I propose a new vote. Who would you least like to teach your child tennis - Amy Winehouse? Pete Doherty? Grace Jones? Or Jimmy Tarbuck?"BBC Sport's TV Mole. Get voting...
1403: Upset on the cards, folks. Lucie Safarova clinches the first set against third seed Jelena Jankovic on Court 1. It's a tight one though - 7-5. Romantics among you will be delighted to know that Safarova and boyf Tommy Berdych are back on track after a reportedly rocky patch during the French Open.
1400: "What Tim and Greg are saying makes sense (see 1352 entry). Wildcard the first, two years OK but after that they should be on their own."Maria via text on 81111
1356: "That really was a super set from Janko Tipsarevic. Fernando Gonzalez was just 10-15% off his best, and Tipsarevic made the most of every chance. He really does look to the manor born on the big stage today."BBC Sport's Mark Petchey
1352: "Tim and I had this conversation before the new LTA regime and we both agree: How can you have players getting wildcards for Wimbledon for six, seven years in row? They have to set themselves goals. They shouldn't need wildcards beyond a certain age."Greg Rusedski joins forces with Henman in the Brit-bashing
1349: "What has Tarbuck ever done apart from go to school with John Lennon, some stand-up at the Palladium, wear golf sweaters and have Liza? That is not enough to get in the Royal Box, in my opinion. Adie on the other hand is a national heroine and deserves a season ticket."BBC Sport's TV Mole
1344: "What's happening in the Chakvetadze-Krajicek match?"Peggy via text on 81111. Since you asked so nicely, Krajicek has fought back from a break down to lead 6-5 in the first set.
1338: "Tipsarevic is like a Serbian Rino Gattuso down there. He's got the tools to trouble Gonzo methinks."BBC Sport's Bryn Palmer on Centre Court as Tipsarevic takes the first set against Gonzalez
1330: Voting over in the website poll and 42% of you reckon the players are to blame for the sorry state of British tennis, so a little bit of respite for the LTA who came in with 36%. Moley, on 22%, will be delighted he's been let off the hook.Henin bt Vesnina 6-1 6-3
1318: Time to crack open the champagne graphic... Veteran comic Jimmy Tarbuck and stern news reporter Kate Adie are in the Royal Box!! And they're sitting next to each other!!!! Wonder what they're talking about? Why not text in your thoughts...
1315: Not long to go on the hard-hitting poll. It's a close-run thing - but most of you reckon the players are to blame for the state of British tennis. It could all change though...
1310: Many of you will be familiar with the work of Sir Tom Fordyce on this very website. Well, Sir Tom is down at Wimbledon today with Mama Fordyce. As the Centre Court action gets under way, STF reports: "My mum is officially over-excited."
1300: We're go, go, go. Fernando Gonzalez and Janko Tipsarevic are out on Centre Court, while Jelena Jankovic and Lucia Safarova stroll out on Court 1. 1253: "Sorry for my recent absence. I have been spying on BBC Sport's Sarah Holt. Saw her hanging round Rafael Nadal and his entourage like a very bad smell. When I first entered the practice area Holty was stood so close to Rafa that she could have told me what deodorant he was wearing. Unbelievable. Not sure if he was happy or not that she was stalking him so blatantly but he didn't hang around for too long."BBC Sport's TV Mole
1247: "Just seen the poll. Can we add "fat middle-aged women who cheer like it was championship point when Tim's opponent dumps a volley into the net at 15 all at 2-3, first set."Mathemagician on 606. Um, no
Join the debate on 606
1241: Fanfare please. The rain has abated and the covers are coming off all round the grounds. No word on when play will resume as yet.
1238: I think the 'mole' should spend some time investigating the Murray-Jankovic rumours (see 1123 entry). It would cheer us all up to confirm this new 'love match'!Stu via text on 81111
1234: The Wimbledon bigwigs reckon it will rain for about half an hour, then be sunny for the rest of the day. Something like that anyway. It's still raining now - but it's also a bit sunny. Crazy!
1231: "My Jack Russel Millie barks like crazy every time Sharapova shrieks when she hits a shot. Other than that Millie likes watching tennis."via text on 81111
1222: Tim Henman departed Wimbledon yesterday with a salvo for his under-achieving colleagues in the British camp. "Players get very short-sighted around March, April time, positioning themselves to get wildcards for Wimbledon. It's another example of what we've got to get away from," he blasted (well, not "blasted", maybe just "said quite forcefully"). Since it's raining, it's time for a vote.
Henman hits out
1214: "What's that coming over the hill is it a Tsonga, is it a Tsonga!"Jo Wilfried Tsonga Fan Club via text on 81111
1210: "I feel I need to apologise to a lot of people. I live about three miles from SW19 and decided 30 minutes ago to take advantage of the sun and stick a load of washing in the machine. I'm sorry for tempting fate."Neil, via text on 81111
1203: Bad news folks. It's raining very heavily - and horizontally. There are still some hardy souls sat under umbrellas on Centre Court. Aren't there always? They're just hoping to get into one of those 'it's raining again at Wimbledon' photos.
1158: "All the players are rushing off the practice courts because of the rain. Martina Hingis barged into me - the cheek. I'm off to shelter with Rafa. Cunning eh?"BBC Sport's Sarah Holt at Wimbledon
1155: Uh-oh. After all that positivity earlier, the black clouds have gathered and a sudden downpour has the players running for cover.
1154: "One for the ladies this: I noticed a thin scar running up Rafa's spine when he took his top off earlier. I wasn't leering... honestly."BBC Sport's Sarah Holt at Wimbledon
1150: "Thanks to all you kind folk who have texted in to point out that I should have opted for cheese sandwiches (see 0958 entry). Really has brightened my day. Really."BBC Sport's Caroline Cheese at Wimbledon
1145: "Here's my main man Rafa, who announces his arrival by kicking Feliciano Lopez in the, er, rear. That one's for Tim."BBC Sport's Sarah Holt at Wimbledon
1141: "It has taken just 22 minutes for Henin to wrap up that first set. She looks so comfortable and confident and she hits the ball so elegantly. She is tormenting Vesnina out here. Henin has not allowed her to come forward and it is one-way traffic at the moment."BBC Five Live's Judy Murray
1135: Latecomers to Court 2 have missed the first set. Henin bags it 6-1 against Vesnina. 1129: "The good news is after indoor practice this morning, the players are back at Aorangi. French youngsters Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are playing nicely together."BBC Sport's Sarah Holt at Wimbledon
More about Tsonga - the Ali of tennis
1123: Confusion reins. A rumour emerged the other day that Andy Murray had a new fan in Serb star Jelena Jankovic. Now it emerges that Jelena actually has the hots for brother Jamie - although she claims it's Murray who is keen on her. And guess what? They're playing mixed doubles later today - and that's not a euphemism. Incidentally, the action is under way. Seeds Henin, Schnyder and Chakvetadze all in control.
1119: "They're replaying Henman v Lopez on Henman Hill... Let it go, let it go."BBC Sport's Sarah Holt at Wimbledon
1113: "The three orange reindeer are back - today they're on Court 13 in support of Dutch player Michaella Krajicek, who's playing Anna Chakvetadze. It's a contrast in hairstyles - Krajicek's is well-gelled and short and spiky while the Russian has a long blonde plait that would make Rapunzel green with envy."BBC Sport's Sophie Brown at Wimbledon
1057: "The droopy-moustached man in Patty's entourage (see 1031 entry) is her hubby Rainier. Just FYI." Daniela's No1 fan, via text on 81111
1053: "Good grief, after the nonsensical drivel that Pete Doherty was going to strum in the queue and Winehouse was going to be teaching nine-year-olds the drop shot (see 0945 entry) we have actually had a genuine pop icon in the grounds. 1980's goddess and all-round barmcake Grace Jones was in yesterday. This sighting of Jones was made by a BBC Sport colleague who now wants to be known as the BBC Sport meerkat (don't worry, I told him to do one). My favourite Miss Jones fact: in 1998, Jones was banned from all Disney properties worldwide after baring her breasts in a concert at Disneyworld. Shocking."BBC Sport's TV Mole
1040: "I reckon today we could see the first major upset in the women's event, with third seed Jelena Jankovic up against the 25th seed Lucie Safarova, and this could be the game where Jankovic's heavy schedule catches up with her."my name isn't Earl MOT on 606

1031: "Just almost bumped into Patty Schnyder coming into the grounds - her entourage included a droopy-moustached man who looked like he was on his way to a 118 casting. The Swiss player is the first match on Court 18 against Ukrainian Alona Bondarenko, who is the middle sibling of the three tennis-playing sisters."BBC Sport's Sophie Brown at Wimbledon
1025: "Two hours after joining the queue in a soggy field at the back of car park 10, we are so close we can almost smell the strawberries."BBC Sport's man in the queue - although shortly to be inside the hallowed grounds
1020: "Today will be the day that decides the men's title. This is the last time Roger can be stopped, not only because Safin is arguably the closest to Fed in terms of natural talent, but mainly because as soon as Fed gets to the second week, there's no stopping him."Tupaki90 on 606

1014: We've got an 1100 BST kick-off today. Justine Henin is among the early birds (so to speak), playing Elena Vesnina on Court 2. Later on Centre Court, Fernando Gonzalez faces Serbian Janko Tipsarevic. Tipsarevic has a tattoo on his left arm reading "Beauty will save the world", a quote from Dostoevsky's The Idiot.
1008: "When I bought my newspaper at 8am this morning, it came with a free poncho. They're now giving out sun cream and some comedy tennis ball-shaped binoculars. I can't help but feel cheated."BBC Sport's man in the queue
0958: "Because of events in central London, security is tighter than ever inside the grounds today. A dog just came dashing through our commentary position. It had a good sniff of my ham sandwiches but eventually gave them the all-clear."BBC Sport's Caroline Cheese at Wimbledon
0950: "Here comes the sun. The raincoats are off and spirits are high in the queue. One of the friendly stewards has just promised us a rain-free day."BBC Sport's man in the queue
0945: Morning all, I'm in an above average mood. I broke the two-hour mark for my commute for the first time this week and managed not to drop my coat on the tracks of the Central Line (see Tuesday). Not even a soaking could dampen my spirits as the sun is now shining brightly. I can barely contain my excitement at the prospect of Amy Winehouse's reported appearance in the LTA Kidzone today. I'm going to stick my neck out here - she's not going to turn up is she?BBC Sport's TV Mole 0935: Amy Winehouse's Rehab is blaring out at Radio Wimbledon. There is a ludicrous rumour that the beehived chanteuse will be at Wimbledon today. At the LTA Kidzone. Winehouse-watch starts here.
0919: Phew, what a scorcher! I jest, of course. It's grey, damp and slightly less chilly than earlier in the week. Still, the Wimbledon weather forecasters remain cautiously optimistic. "Early rain clearing. A few sunny intervals developing." Hurrah! "But also showers for many and some of these showers could be briefly heavy." Boo!
We'll be here throughout the day to bring you the latest news from around the All England Club, both on the courts and off, so whether you're settling down at home, stuck in the office or queuing on Church Road, send us your thoughts.
