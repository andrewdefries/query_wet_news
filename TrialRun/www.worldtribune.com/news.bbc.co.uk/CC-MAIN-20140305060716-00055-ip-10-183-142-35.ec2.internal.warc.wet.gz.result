High IQ link to being vegetarian
Vegetarianism has been linked to better heart health
Intelligent children are more likely to become vegetarians later in life, a study says.
A Southampton University team found those who were vegetarian by 30 had recorded five IQ points more on average at the age of 10.
Researchers said it could explain why people with higher IQ were healthier as a vegetarian diet was linked to lower heart disease and obesity rates.
The study of 8,179 was reported in the British Medical Journal.
Twenty years after the IQ tests were carried out in 1970, 366 of the participants said they were vegetarian - although more than 100 reported eating either fish or chicken.
Men who were vegetarian had an IQ score of 106, compared with 101 for non-vegetarians; while female vegetarians averaged 104, compared with 99 for non-vegetarians.
We've always known that vegetarianism is an intelligent, compassionate choice benefiting animals, people and the environment
Liz O'Neill, of The Vegetarian Society
There was no difference in IQ score between strict vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarian but who reported eating fish or chicken. Researchers said the findings were partly related to better education and higher occupational social class, but it remained statistically significant after adjusting for these factors.
Vegetarians were more likely to be female, to be of higher occupational social class and to have higher academic or vocational qualifications than non-vegetarians. However, these differences were not reflected in their annual income, which was similar to that of non-vegetarians.
Lead researcher Catharine Gale said: "The finding that children with greater intelligence are more likely to report being vegetarian as adults, together with the evidence on the potential benefits of a vegetarian diet on heart health, may help to explain why higher IQ in childhood or adolescence is linked with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease in adult life." Intelligence
However, she added the link may be merely an example of many other lifestyle preferences that might be expected to vary with intelligence, such as choice of newspaper, but which may or may not have implications for health.
Liz O'Neill, of the Vegetarian Society, said: "We've always known that vegetarianism is an intelligent, compassionate choice benefiting animals, people and the environment. "Now we've got the scientific evidence to prove it. Maybe that explains why many meat-reducers are keen to call themselves vegetarians when even they must know that vegetarians don't eat chicken, turkey or fish."
But Dr Frankie Phillips, of the British Dietetic Association, said: "It is like the chicken and the egg. Do people become vegetarian because they have a very high IQ or is it just that they tend to be more aware of health issues?"

Q&A: The G20 summit
Gordon Brown hopes the US will help boost the world economy
World leaders are meeting in London on 2 April at the G20 summit to discuss plans to tackle the current economic crisis. We explain why the meeting has been called and what it hopes to accomplish.
What is the G20?
The G20 is a group of the world's most powerful countries that together represent 85% of the world's economy. It includes both major industrial powers such as the US and Germany, and emerging economic powers such as Brazil and China. The UK government, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20, is organising the London summit to tackle the growing economic crisis with coordinated action. It follows the first G20 meeting of heads of government which took place last November in Washington. The G20 was originally set up after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 to discuss international co-operation among finance ministers and central bankers. What are the aims of the London summit?
Gordon Brown believes that the aim of the London summit is no less than the redesign of the world financial system to respond to the downturn. There are three main aims of the summit. First, co-ordinated action to revive the world economy, both by more interest rate cuts and more spending by governments to bring countries out of recession. Secondly, there will be efforts to prevent a future crisis by strengthening the international regulation of banks and other financial institutions. Thirdly, leaders are hoping to agree a blueprint for future reform of the world financial system, including changes to the international organisations charged with regulating the world economy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to give a greater voice to poorer countries, and more resources. Overall, it is hoped that the summit will prevent a slide towards protectionism by giving countries hope that working together could be a more effective way of dealing with the downturn. What are the main obstacles to any deal?
Expectations of a comprehensive deal have been downplayed in recent days. The most controversial issue is how far governments are prepared to go to agree further public spending to boost growth. European countries, in particular, are resisting the calls from the US to promise to spend more not only this year but in 2010. Restructuring the international financial institutions is also likely to be controversial, as giving more power to emerging market countries such as China and Brazil would mean taking away power and influence from European countries in the IMF and World Bank. And there is yet to be agreement on how much more money should flow to poor countries who have been hard-hit by the downturn. And although countries will say they are against protectionism in general, policing that agreement could be problematic. What is likely to happen?
The summit is likely to produce a broad agreement on the need for coordinated action, but no concrete blueprint for future action. With many countries already launching global stimulus plans, it may be relatively easy to agree to support such measures in principle. The summit will agree a blueprint for the reform of the financial system that will put in place stronger global regulation - but that will take several years to implement. And it is likely to endorse changes to the international financial institutions like the IMF, giving them more money and giving more voting rights for emerging countries like China. There are unlikely to be any concrete measures to curb the fluctuations in exchange rates, which have hit many developing countries hard, although they may be pledges to maintain the flow of aid. And there will be a general endorsement of the need to avoid protectionism, but it is unlikely to be enough to restart the world trade talks that have been stalled for the last year. Full membership of the G20: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the US and the EU.
