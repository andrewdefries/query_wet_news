World recalls end of World War I
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Prince Charles and Nicolas Sarkozy lay wreaths in north-east France
Ceremonies have been held across the globe to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I.
At a service in Verdun, north-east France, President Nicolas Sarkozy paid tribute to the millions who died during the four-year conflict.
French and German troops fought for eight months at Verdun in the longest battle of a war that reshaped Europe.
In the US, politicians took part in the annual Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington cemetery, near Washington.
Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defence Secretary Robert Gates were among those to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the national cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns to honour those who have died in service to the US.
President George W Bush marked his final Veterans Day as commander-in-chief with a speech at a decommissioned aircraft carrier, the USS Intrepid, in New York.
He paid tribute to the armed forces and thanked veterans across the US for "standing up when your nation needed you the most".
President-elect Barack Obama, meanwhile, honoured fallen troops by laying a wreath at a memorial in Chicago's Soldier Field.
Earlier in London, three of the four surviving British World War I veterans attended a ceremony at the Cenotaph.
Henry Allingham, 112, Harry Patch, 110, and Bill Stone, 108, represented the Royal Air Force, Army and Royal Navy respectively.
At 1100 GMT, a two-minute silence was observed, marking the time - at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month - when the Armistice Treaty came into effect to end the war.
No survivors
Earlier on Tuesday, President Sarkozy took part in an Armistice Day service in Verdun, and paid tribute to those who had died.
France will never forget the children who have fought for her

"France will never forget the children who have fought for her," he said.
He paid respect to the soldiers from Europe, North America, Africa and Australasia "who died far away from their countries to defend our liberty".
Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the Duchess of Cornwall were guests of honour at the event.
But no French or German veterans were in attendance, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Jonny Dymond. Not one member of the two huge armies that clashed on the fields of Verdun survives.
Only the dead were left to be remembered, and the backdrop of the service was a huge stone ossuary, containing the remains of tens of thousands of men from both sides who died in the fighting.

Mr Sarkozy, Prince Charles, Australia's Governor-General Quentin Bryce and Peter Mueller, president of the German Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, laid wreaths in a field of 15,000 graves in front of the building.
A respectful silence was held and the bell tolled inside the ossuary, where Mr Sarkozy lit a memorial flame and a male choir sang the French national anthem.
Since the war, Verdun has become a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation.
But its hillside has come to symbolise World War I's awful savagery, says our correspondent. During the fighting, more than 60 million shells fell on the land, transforming it into a pitted piece of hell on earth.
Pacific century
As well as services across Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan, remembrance ceremonies have been held in Australia, which lost 60,000 men in the conflict.
Services were held across Australia to remember the dead
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd used a speech at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra to issue a call for peace.
"We have all endured a most bloody century," he said.
"Let us resolve afresh at the dawn of this new century... that this might be a truly pacific peaceful century."
A lone bugler then played the Last Post, which is used to to commemorate the war dead in Commonwealth countries.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was in Warsaw to mark the anniversary of Poland's independence - which also came on 11 November 1918.
World War I was the world's first industrialised war.
It toppled four European empires, led to the creation of the Soviet Union and marked the end of Europe's long global hegemony.

Sick baby's family thanks judge
Baby MB cannot chew, swallow or breathe for himself
The parents of a severely disabled baby boy at the centre of a right-to-life case have thanked the judge for ruling that he should be kept alive.
They were fighting a hospital's bid to turn off the ventilator that keeps the child, known only as Baby MB, alive.
The 19-month-old boy has genetic condition spinal muscular atrophy - which leads to almost total paralysis.
The judge said he felt the child gained enough pleasure from life to outweigh the medical evidence of his condition.
No court has yet been asked to approve, against the will of parents, the withdrawal of life support
Mr Justice Holman
CPS:LINK HREF="" ID="CPS:LINK HREF="" ID="4810180" STYLE="rightarrow">Parents' view
Is Baby MB's life worth living?
In an exclusive BBC interview the child's mother said: "I really thank the judge for coming to that decision."
His father said Mr Justice Holman was right to rule the ventilator that keeps the baby alive should not be switched off.
During the case at the High Court in London, Baby MB's mother described how he responded to certain cartoons, such as Shrek and Finding Nemo - but did not appear to like the news or Eastenders.
But a total of 14 medics, including two independent doctors called by the parents, told the hearing his quality of life was so poor he should be allowed to die.
Doctors argued the invasive ventilation which is keeping the child alive is likely to be uncomfortable, with one saying he felt the child had an "intolerable life".
Baby MB, from the north of England, cannot breathe unaided and is almost totally paralysed. He also cannot chew or swallow.
He suffers from the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy and has lived in a high dependency unit in hospital since he was seven weeks old.
His parents want him to have a tracheotomy ,which could make long-term ventilation easier, so he is able to leave his hospital bedroom and explore the grounds, albeit with the assistance of medical staff.
Simple pleasures
Giving his judgement, Mr Justice Holman did not dispute the medical evidence, and said Baby MB would not experience simple childhood pleasures, such as taking his first steps or the "rough and tumble" of playing with other children.
The court has agreed with the assessment of Baby MB's quality of life by those people who know him best

CPS:LINK HREF="" ID="CPS:LINK HREF="" ID="4809908" STYLE="rightarrow">A medical ethicist's view
But the judge said he was not unconscious and was capable of bonding with his family.
He said Baby MB could probably see, hear and feel - taking pleasure from the eight or nine hours his family spend with him each day.
Justice Holman said: "It must be assumed that he processes all of those sights and sounds like any child of his age and gains pleasure from them."
He added: "No court has yet been asked to approve, against the will of parents, the withdrawal of life support with the inevitable and immediate death of a conscious child with sensory awareness and cognition, and no significant evidence of brain damage."
The solicitor for the family said they felt "vindicated" by the judgement.
"In the judgement, the court has agreed with the assessment of Baby MB's quality of life by those people who know him best."
He said the parents would take time to consider the detail of the judgement.
Public hearing
However, the judgement does not mean that Baby MB would be kept alive indefinitely or that doctors would have to give treatment to the baby in any situation.
The judge has said that, if Baby MB's heart stops, it will be lawful for doctors not to give him drugs or defibrillator treatment to restart it.
They would also be allowed not to give antibiotics if he develops certain serious infections.
His parents said his quality of life must be fully assessed before any such decision is made.
A court order bans the identification of the boy, his family, the hospital where he is cared for and the medics involved in his care.
But details of the case can be reported after BBC lawyers made an application for the hearing to be held in public.
In a statement, the trust caring for Baby MB said it was an extremely difficult case, and it had consulted a range of experts and organisations before going to court.
It added: "The trust will now consider the details of the ruling and how best to care for MB in the light of this decision, continuing to act in his best interest."
It will now have to decide whether it wants to challenge the High Court ruling.
Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of ethics at the British Medical Association, said: "For doctors, the decisions are extraordinarily difficult because they have to have at the centre of their sights the child and the welfare of the child, and not putting the child through a burdensome treatment where there is no hope of any future improvement."

In pictures: Italy earthquake
Hopes are fading of finding any more survivors of the devastating earthquake in the Abruzzo region of central Italy.
Rescuers have pulled more than 100 people alive from collapsed homes in and around the town of L'Aquila.
But more than 200 people are confirmed to have died in the powerful quake, which struck in the early hours of Monday morning.
Rescuers worked through the night, pulling away concrete slabs with their bare hands to reach survivors from the disaster, which also left 1,500 people injured.
Tens of thousands of people have been left homeless, some spending the night in their cars while others went to tent camps set up to provide basic shelter.
Aid workers distributed basic supplies to the survivors, including milk, meals and hot drinks.
Field hospitals were set up to treat the wounded and doctors attended to patients in the open air.
Some residents returned to their homes to try to salvage what they could of their possessions.
Others who lost everything are waiting in the temporary camps amid continuing aftershocks.
Many ancient castles and churches are among those damaged or destroyed in the region's towns and villages.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said 15 people were still missing, and rescuers should know within 48 hours whether anyone remains alive under the rubble.

Protest boats sail for Gaza Strip
The boats are carrying 40 activists, 200 hearing aids and 5,000 balloons
Two boats carrying members of a US-based pro-Palestinian group have left Cyprus in an attempt to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip.
The boats left the Cypriot port of Larnaca on Friday morning. The journey is expected to take about 30 hours.
The Free Gaza protest group said about 40 activists from 14 countries were on board the boats.
Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in June 2007 when the militant group Hamas took control of the territory by force.
Since then, Israel has allowed in little more than basic humanitarian aid as a means of isolating Hamas and persuading militant groups to stop firing rockets into Israel.
The closure of Gaza's borders by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities has also meant that very few Gazans have been able to leave.
'Supporting Hamas'
Before Free Gaza's boats set sail on Friday, the Israeli foreign ministry warned them to steer clear of the Gazan coastline, which it said was "the subject of an [Israeli Navy] advisory notice" that warns off foreign vessels from the "designated maritime zone".
Truce barely eases Gaza embargoGuide: Gaza under blockade
"We assume that your intentions are good but, in fact, the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organisation in Gaza," the ministry wrote in an open letter. The two vessels - named Liberty and Free Gaza - are carrying 200 hearing aids for children and 5,000 balloons.
"No matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for Palestinians," organiser Paul Larudee told the AFP news agency.
"We want people to see the Palestinian problem as one of human rights, not feeding them rice," he added.
The activists include Lauren Booth, sister-in-law of former British PM Tony Blair, who is now an international Middle East peace envoy. Also on board is left-wing Greek MP Tasos Kourakis.
Israel withdrew its settlers from Gaza in 2005, but it still controls its coast, airspace and borders, and, until a ceasefire with Hamas was agreed in June, carried out regular military operations in the territory.
However, correspondents say the truce has not improved the situation for Gaza's population, except to reduce the number of Israeli incursions and the number of rockets fired by Palestinian militants.

Has life got any better?

What's the future for Afghan children?
What about fun stuff?
During the Taleban years, children were prevented from having many things UK kids take for granted - like TV.
But these are now gradually returning to the country.
In November 2001, cartoons, interviews, news and prayer readings appeared on TV again after a five-year ban. They were introduced by 16-year-old Mariam Shakebar - who had been a popular children's TV presenter. She lost her job when the Taleban came to power. Some people had destroyed their TVs during the Taleban years - but others had hidden them away, so they could watch again.

Ronaldo injury misery continues
Ronaldo suffered further ankle damage against Hungary in October
Real Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo is to consult his former specialist in the Netherlands after his ankle injury failed to show signs of improvement.The £80m signing from Manchester United first sustained the problem to his right ankle in September and aggravated it playing for Portugal on 10 October. He will now see Professor Niek van Dyjk who treated the same ankle in 2008. "He cannot train and must continue treatment and relief work until another examination is made," Real explained. Early diagnosis of Ronaldo's injury suggested he would be sidelined for between three and four weeks. Instead the 24-year-old, who scored nine goals in helping Real win each of their opening seven competitive matches this season, has missed his team's last seven games, only two of which have been won.

Charlie Adam switch would boost Rangers' coffers
Adam could be about to wave goodbye to Blackpool
By Alasdair Lamont
Rangers are in line for a windfall without having to transfer any more players - thanks to Charlie Adam.The former Rangers midfielder, now with Blackpool, has been the subject of failed bids from Liverpool, Birmingham City and Aston Villa. And a sell-on clause means the Ibrox club stand to make 10% of any deal worth more than the £500,000 Blackpool paid for the 25-year-old in 2009. The most recent bid, from Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool, was for £4m. Any additional cash would be welcomed by Rangers, who continue to be under pressure financially from their bankers. They were unable to persuade Kenny Miller to sign a contract extension beyond the summer and the Scotland striker was instead lured to Turkey by a lucrative offer from Bursaspor.
They don't have that passer. Charlie is their man and I don't want to stand in his way, but Liverpool's offer is totally unacceptable
Blackpool manager Ian Holloway
Rangers accepted £400,000 after allowing Miller to leave the Glasgow club during January rather than exit for nothing at the end of the season. Following the latest rebuff from Blackpool, Scotland midfielder Adam handed in a transfer request to the Barclays Premier League club. That has been rejected by chairman Karl Oyston, with manager Ian Holloway urging their English top-flight rivals to increase their offer if they truly want the player. "If the player is good enough, they should sign him," said the Blackpool boss. "They are mad not to want to buy him off us. He could replace Xabi Alonso, which is something they have still not done.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Holloway annoyed by amount offered for Adam
"They don't have that passer. Charlie is their man and I don't want to stand in his way, but Liverpool's offer is totally unacceptable." Holloway rejects the suggestion that Adam's form could slump if he fails to win his dream move during this transfer window. "Will I ever have the same Charlie Adam? I don't know," he said. "But this is his first season in this division and, before our game on Saturday, we were 10th even though our total budget is less than Carlos Tevez earns in a year. Charlie has been a major part of that. "If he loses his spirit, it would be a crying shame." Meanwhile, despite reports linking Kris Commons with Rangers, it is believed that the Scottish champions have no plans at this stage to approach his present club, Derby County, about the winger who is out of contract in the summer.
