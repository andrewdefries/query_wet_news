Bid to ban 'racist' Tintin book
Tintin was created by Belgian writer and illustrator Herge
The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) is calling on high street books to pull a Tintin adventure from its shelves over claims it is racist. Complaints about Tintin in the Congo have led to Borders and Waterstones moving it to their adult section.
A spokeswoman said the book contained "words of hideous racial prejudice, where the 'savage natives' look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles".
Borders said they are committed to let their "customers make the choice".
'Racist claptrap'
The store's spokesman added: "Naturally, some of the thousands of books and music selections we carry could be considered controversial or objectionable depending on individual political views, tastes and interests."
A Waterstones spokesman said: "We have reviewed the title's situation and are moving it away from the other Tintin titles into the graphic novel section."
The CRE spokewoman said: "How and why do Borders think that it's okay to peddle such racist material?" "The only place that it might be acceptable for this to be displayed would be in a museum, with a big sign saying 'old-fashioned, racist claptrap.'
"It's high time that they reconsidered their decision and removed this from their shelves," she added.
The book's publishers Egmont said the book comes with a warning that it features "bourgeois, paternalistic stereotypes of the period - an interpretation some readers may find offensive".
The Tintin adventures were written by Belgian author Herge - real name Georges Prosper Remi - from 1929 until his death in 1983.
He continued to revise his books after their publication, and admitted embarrassment over some of the views they expressed.
A scene in Tintin in the Congo in which the eponymous hero gave a geography lesson to Africans about Belgium was later changed to a maths class.

Surgery for girl attacked by dog
Niamh had to have 100 stitches to repair the damage to her face
A nine-year-old Derbyshire girl has undergone reconstructive facial surgery after being bitten by a dog.
Niamh Webster-Guy was standing on a pavement outside a friend's house in Cotmanhay when a Bullmastiff dog jumped up a fence and attacked her.
Niamh underwent a three-hour operation to repair damage to her face and received more than 100 stitches.
The dog's owners declined to comment. Derbyshire Police said they were investigating last week's attack.
An RSPCA spokesperson said because the dog was on private property, the Dangerous Dogs Act may not apply in this case.
Cheryl Webster, Niamh's mother, said she wanted the dog to be destroyed. "I want justice done...not only because of what has happened to us but because it could happen again.
"I think it's the responsible thing to do."
Niamh said she was still upset about her injuries. "It just feels numb and like a balloon. I still feel it's quite gruesome and bad."

Roy Jenkins dies
Roy Jenkins was home secretary twice
Former Labour Chancellor and Home Secretary Lord Jenkins of Hillhead has died, aged 82.
He collapsed at his home in Oxfordshire on Sunday morning, a spokeswoman for his
family said.
After serving twice as home secretary in a Labour Government, Lord Jenkins was one of the "Gang of Four" who formed the breakaway SDP party in 1981.
A statement issued by the family on Sunday said: "Dame Jennifer Jenkins and Charles,
Cynthia and Edward are very sad to announce that their husband and father Roy
Jenkins, collapsed and died this morning at home at 0900 GMT."
Lord Jenkins was one of the most remarkable
people ever to grace British politics. I will miss him deeply.
Tony Blair
After hearing the news, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Lord Jenkins was "one of the most remarkable people ever to grace British politics."
Former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan said: "He was one of the outstanding statesmen of his era."
Lord Owen, a co-founder of the SDP, said: "He was by any standards a major political figure and historical figure
in the context of the last century."
'A great man'
Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: "He was a big political figure and his passing is a sad moment."Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said: "Roy Jenkins was a great man and a great personal friend."
He co-founded the SDP party in 1981
Lord Jenkins' 50-year career began after serving in the Royal Artillery and in 1965, he became home secretary under Harold Wilson.
He oversaw radical social reforms on divorce, abortion,
homosexuality and penal reform, earning himself the title "the architect of the permissive society" in the press.
After further stints at the Treasury and the Home Office, he campaigned in a referendum to keep Britain in the Common Market and was rewarded with the presidency of the European Commission in 1976. Politics pays tributeClick here for full story
In 1981 he joined Shirley Williams, Dr David Owen and Bill Rodgers to break with the Labour party and set up the Social Democrats (SDP).
He was regarded by some in the Labour Party as a traitor for this and pushing the party further into the wilderness.
Lord Healey, a former Labour Chancellor who studied with Lord Jenkins at Oxford University, told BBC News: "Without Roy, Thatcher would really never have happened." Lord Jenkins presents his budget in 1970
Lord Jenkins led the new party for a year and fought the 1983 election alongside the Liberals as the Alliance, winning a quarter of the votes.
But he lost his seat in 1987 and went to the House of Lords. He saw Tony Blair as the natural heir to his brand of politics, but was ultimately disappointed with what he saw as a lack of progress on voting reform and the euro.
Lord Jenkins was also an accomplished biographer who had recently written an acclaimed work on the life of Winston Churchill.

Facey secures late Bolton win
Kenny Cunningham's own goal put Bolton in front
Bolton 4-2 Birmingham
Have your say on the 606 Premiership page
Bolton left it late to secure their first Premiership win since Boxing Day with a thrilling victory over Birmingham at the Reebok Stadium.
Delroy Facey and Youri Djorkaeff both scored in the final 10 minutes to cruelly deny Birmingham, who had twice come from behind.
We aleays kept our noses in front and that was important for us today
Bolton boss Sam Allardyce
The defeat leaves Birmingham without a win in the Premiership for seven games.
Bolton took the lead in the 12th minute after an error by defender Kenny Cunningham.
Ricardo Gardner sent in a cross from the left that did not appear to be that dangerous.
But Cunningham got a poor touch and steered the ball past stranded keeper Ian Bennett.
The goal came after a good spell of pressure from Birmingham with Christophe Dugarry orchestrating the visitors' attacking play.
But Bolton's defence stood firm and both Bernard Mendy and Gundi Bergsson were forced to make timely interceptions.
Key moments
12 mins: Kenny Cunningham's own goal puts Bolton ahead
44 mins: Robbie Savage nets the equaliser
46 mins: Pedersen puts Bolton back in front
60 mins: Clinton Morrison draws Birmingham level
84 mins: Youri Djorkaeff looks to have scored the winner
87 mins: Delroy Facey secures the three points
Pedersen almost added a second for Bolton but under pressure from Jeff Kenna steered his shot wide.
Dugarry should have done better in the 28th minute when he found himself unmarked in a good position, only to head wide.
But the Frenchman made amends on the stroke of half-time.
You can't give away goals like that and we shot ourselves in the foot
Birmimgham manager Steve Bruce
Dugarry picked out Stan Lazaridis on the left and the Australian's superb ball across the face of the goal found Robbie Savage who steered home the equaliser.
But Sam Allardyce's half-time words clearly invigorated Bolton who regained their advantage just 35 seconds after the restart.
Djorkaeff showed great skill to create some space in the box and his through ball was bundled in by Henrik Pedersen.
Gardner should have made it 3-1 a minute later but he dragged his effort across the face of the goal and wide of the post.
Premiership photos
And he was made to rue the missed chance on the hour mark when Stephen Clemence and Clinton Morrison combined for Birmingham's equaliser.
Both sides failed to take chances as the game progressed and Bolton looked like being frustrated in their search for the winner.
But with just six minutes to go, Jay Jay Okocha pounced on Bennett's poor clearance to set up Djorkaeff for Bolton's third.
Minutes later substitute Facey was quickest to react to Okocha's parried shot to fire past Bennett and send the home crowd into hysterics.

Diver Shipman into semis
Latest diving results
Great Britain's Mark Shipman squeezed into the semi-finals of the men's Olympic 3m springboard diving event.
The 31-year-old from Sheffield amassed a total of 396.90 points to grab the last qualifying place, meaning he will dive first in Tuesday's semi-finals.
Canadian teenager Alexandre Despatie led the preliminaries with 517.59 ahead of China's Peng Bo.
Australian Robert Newbery qualified the day after his wife Chantelle won the women's 10m platform title.
Russian Dmitry Sautin, who claimed 10m platform gold in 1996, also went through in sixth place.
But American hope Justic Willcock trailed in last place after he failed a dive in the fifth round before clipping his feet on the board in his sixth attempt.
Shipman will need to finish inside the top 12 if he is to reach Wednesday's final.
