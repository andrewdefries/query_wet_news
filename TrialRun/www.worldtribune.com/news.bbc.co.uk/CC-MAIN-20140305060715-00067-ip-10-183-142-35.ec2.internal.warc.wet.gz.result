Reaching across LA's ethnic divide
By David Willis
BBC News, Los Angeles
It is 7am on the sprawling campus of the most notorious US inner-city schools. Pupils are filing into class under the watchful eye not of teachers, but policemen. Antonio Villaraigosa needs to attract votes from varied ethnic groups
Violent clashes between black and Latino students in recent weeks have left several students seriously injured.
The special guest at a peace rally outside the school is a man many in the US' second-largest city are looking towards to ease its simmering racial tensions. Antonio Villaraigosa, a former gang member, talks not of segregation but unity. He has gained the support of prominent African-American leaders in his campaign to become Los Angeles' first Latino mayor in more than 130 years and he is believed to be ahead of his competitors. "I could be the first," states Mr Villaraigosa. "But what I've said to people is: what we know for sure is that I won't be the last. "And my opportunity here is to be a mayor for all the people: a mayor that unites us; a mayor that focuses on what we have in common; a mayor who's got the ability and the energy to build a consensus around the tough challenges that we face."
'Opening doors'
The son of a Mexican immigrant, Mr Villaraigosa epitomises the American Dream. Having dropped out of college, he paid his own way through law school and is now the fastest-rising Latino star in US politics: a source of hope for the poorest, fastest-growing section of this sprawling city.
"We recognise that, if he's elected to office, this opens a lot of doors for the community at large," says Alahundro Menchaka, president of the Latino Professional Network, one of the many organisations backing Mr Villaraigosa. [Antonio Villaraigosa's] campaign is an excellent example of an exercise in practising the politics of diversity
Efran Escibido,National Association of Latino Elected Officials
"And that's something that needs to be done and has probably taken too long.
"He's really building bridges and has built bridges throughout his career amongst these different communities, to really unite LA and really celebrate its diversity, more so than any other candidate that I've seen."
Although Latinos are the largest minority group here, only a relatively small number are registered to vote. So, to become mayor and oust incumbent James Hahn, Mr Villaraigosa must build and retain a consensus - effectively, a coalition of all races. Diverse challenges
"I think that his campaign is an excellent example of an exercise in practising the politics of diversity," says Efran Escibido, of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials. "We understand that the next mayor will not be elected by one single group in the city. And no group expects to elect a mayor on their own. "It's a group of voters from diverse backgrounds - say, Jewish voters, in conjunction with African-American voters, white voters and Latino voters, really coming together around issues, around the future of the city."
With racial tensions spilling from the streets to the classroom, the challenge could hardly be greater. The hope here is that this election will prove a watershed, inspiring greater political participation from a large but traditionally disenfranchised section of society. But Mr Villaraigosa will be judged not just on what he can do for Latinos but on whether he can make good on his promise to bring this diverse city back together.

UN concerned over Uzbek 'torture'
By Imogen Foulkes
BBC News, Geneva
President Karimov's government is beset by torture allegations
The United Nations Committee Against Torture has expressed extreme concern over allegations of widespread torture in Uzbekistan. The committee was responding to a report from Uzbekistan on its compliance with the UN convention prohibiting torture.
Uzbekistan denies all the allegations made against it. The report this time coincides with growing international concern over human rights violations in Uzbekistan.
The committee's report is nine pages long, and contains over 20 points of very serious concern relating to torture in Uzbekistan. Chief among them, allegations of the routine use of torture by law enforcement officials, the failure by the authorities to investigate allegations of torture, and the obstruction of independent human rights organisations trying to monitor the situation. Denial
Committee members said they had received hundreds of allegations of torture, all with corroborating evidence, and all following very similar patterns. As a signatory to the convention, Uzbekistan is required to appear before the committee at regular intervals. Uzbekistan's representatives in Geneva denied every single allegation - the committee's report, like all UN reports, is couched in relatively diplomatic language, but the conclusion is inescapable - if even a fraction of the reports of torture are true, Uzbekistan is in violation of the United Nations convention against torture. Uzbekistan now has one year to act on a series of recommendations from the committee - among them the introduction of a policy of zero tolerance to torture, and the practice of granting impunity to those who commit it.

Eyesight services 'inadequate'
Many people with low vision have problems accessing services, says the RNIB
People with poor vision are being let down by inadequate NHS services, says the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB).
About 1.5 million people in the UK are estimated to have a serious sight problem which is not improved with glasses or contact lenses.
As a result, they can experience problems with performing even the simplest of tasks, such as preparing meals.
The RNIB has published two reports which show that information on services is scarce and that support varies from region to region.
One report, Fragmented Vision, by the RNIB and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, found that there were few or no services available in Wales, western Scotland and south-west England, which have a higher than average number of people with vision problems.
However, in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool there was a plethora of services.
Diminished quality of life
Two out of every five service providers, mainly specialist departments in hospitals, questioned did not offer any low vision services at all.
The report states: "A lack of low vision services will mean more residential care and attendance costs for local authorities.
"It is a nonsense that such a core rehabilitation service is not uniformly provided in the United Kingdom.
"A growing number of vulnerable people in this country experience a quality of life that is significantly, but unnecessarily, diminished for want of basic, relatively inexpensive health care."
Low vision services can offer information about vision aids, check sight problems and refer onto other agencies.
The RNIB says vision aids can include a range of practical objects, such as angle-poised lamps, big buttoned telephones and bright kitchen equipment.
It has produced leaflets and runs a helpline - 0345 669999 - which give information about products and how to get hold of them.
It says they should be tailored to a person's individual needs as aids like magnifiers can do more harm than good if they are the wrong strength. Some may be available on prescription.
Eligibility criteria
The Moorfields/RNIB report also says organisations which provide services for people with low vision have different eligibility criteria.
Three per cent required people to be registered as blind. Sixteen per cent had a minimum level of sight qualification and 15% said they would only accept people who were referred by other professionals.
The RNIB wants services to be uniform and available wherever a person lives.
The report calls on the government to expand low vision services and offer different types of service.
It calls on health professionals to co-operate better to improve services and for researchers to investigate ways of making services better.
Another report by the RNIB and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh says many people with low vision receive poor information about vision aids that can make their lives easier.
Many people interviewed for the report, Better Vision, said they had to ring round to find out about services, rather than being told when they were diagnosed.
They also complained of being passed around different agencies and lengthy waiting lists for assessment.
Some patients were waiting up to a year for an appointment, while their condition worsened.
The report says low vision should get much greater priority, that more information about services should be available, that waiting times are reduced and that people should be helped in using vision aids.
Barbara Ryan of the RNIB said: "It is scandalous that people are being told that there is nothing more that can be done. "There are services to help, but people are not getting the information they need about them."

'Saddam' denies killing cleric
Hakim's procession drew thousands in Karbala
An audiotape said to be of Saddam Hussein denying involvement in the killing of a senior Iraqi Shia cleric has been broadcast by Arab television channels.
Ayatollah Muhammad Baqr al-Hakim died in a massive car bomb blast in the Shia holy city of Najaf last Friday, along with at least 80 other people.
Ahead of his burial in Najaf on Tuesday, Shia ceremonies have been continuing to bid farewell to the revered late ayatollah, who had a long history of fighting the former Iraqi regime.
Meanwhile, after weeks of wrangling the US-appointed governing council named a cabinet, where Shias will control 13 of the 25 posts.
The cabinet members, who are to act as government ministers in an interim administration until elections are held, represent Iraq's various sectarian communities, but include only one woman.
'Hissing snakes'
"Many of you might have heard the hissing of snakes, the servants of the infidel occupation invaders, who - after the killing of al-Hakim - rushed to accuse, without any evidence, those they called the supporters of Saddam Hussein of the incident," the tape said.

Voice on 'Saddam' tape
Text of 'Saddam' tape
"Saddam Hussein does not attribute this saying to himself." US audio analysts have yet to say if the voice on the tape really is that of Saddam Hussein, but the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says experts already saying they believe it is genuine.
He says that by denying the responsibility for the bombing, Saddam Hussein - if it is him - has wasted little time in distancing himself from the atrocity.
But among the tens of thousands of Shias who have been joining the funeral procession behind the coffin of the murdered ayatollah, there is little doubt that loyalists of Saddam Hussein were responsible, says the BBC's Valerie Jones.
FUNERAL PROCESSION
Sunday: Kadhimiyah
Monday: Karbala
Tuesday: Najaf
In pictures: Karbala mourns
Ayatollah's last sermon
Ayatollah Hakim - the leader of the Iranian-backed Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri) - had returned to Iraq after more than two decades in exile, and cautiously supported co-operation with the US occupying forces.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been called in to help investigate the Najaf attack, which happened just after the late cleric had delivered a sermon for Friday prayers.
The FBI's top agent in Iraq, Thomas Fuentes, said experts would look for links between the Najaf bombing and attacks on the UN headquarters and Jordanian embassy in Baghdad last month. Mr Fuentes told the French news agency that their work would not, however, start until after Tuesday's burial.
The huge funeral procession for the dead cleric - whose coffin is being taken to holy shrines before burial, as Shia tradition demands - passed through the holy city of Karbala on Monday. Shia tradition also demands that a senior cleric performs the final burial for another leading cleric, but that given the widespread concern about the lack of security in Najaf, it is not clear whether any of the four prominent Shia authorities in the city will be present for the burial, says the BBC's Sadeq Saba.
Symbolic act
Monday's announcement of the ministerial cabinet - which took weeks to agree because a wide range of political, religious and ethnic groups had to be accommodated - is seen as a significant step forward in setting up a new government.
CABINET MEMBERS
13 - Shias
5 - Sunnis
5 - Kurds

1 - Assyrian Christians
Click here for a full list of cabinet members
The key position of interior minister with responsibility for security goes to former exile Nouri Badran - a member of the American-sponsored Iraqi National Accord, a group that opposed Saddam Hussein. The finance ministry goes to a Sunni, Kamel al-Kailani, while a Shia, Ibrahim Muhammad Bahr al-Ulloum, is named finance minister. The foreign affairs ministry will be headed by a Kurd, Hoshiar al-Zibari, while the only woman in the cabinet, Nisreen Mustafa al-Burwari (also a Kurd) is public works minister.
BBC Middle East analyst Roger Hardy says the naming of a cabinet is largely a symbolic act, and the new ministers will have to convince a sceptical Iraqi public that they constitute an independent body and not a tool of the Americans.

Skills lack 'threat to heritage'
Peers urged the culture department to do more to safeguard the UK's heritage
The UK's cultural heritage is under threat as the knowledge and skills for preserving artefacts are being lost, a committee of peers has warned.
The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee fears Britain's reputation as a leader in the science underpinning conservation is in danger.
The peers called on the government to act to save historical buildings and works of art. But the government says it cannot dictate how museums use public funds.
The Science and Heritage report criticised the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) for "failing to grasp the seriousness of the threat to heritage science and its wider implications for conservation".
It said the department's focus on "widening access to our cultural heritage had also helped to hasten its deterioration". Our priceless cultural artefacts face not just the familiar threats of wear and tear, but new threats such as climate change
Baroness SharpCommittee chairman
Committee chairman Baroness Sharp said: "We must safeguard our cultural heritage not only for the present generation, but also for future generations.
"We must not allow unique, iconic physical artefacts that embody British culture to be lost through poor management."
She said Britain was for a long time at the forefront of conservation techniques, with the development of science-based conservation at the National Gallery and British Museum.
But key conservation research was now undervalued in Britain, she said. 'Of vital importance'
"At the same time, our priceless cultural artefacts face not just the familiar threats of wear and tear, but new threats such as climate change," she said.
The UK as a nation must develop new techniques and apply scientific research in this area to maintain its wealth of cultural, artistic and architectural heritage, she said.
"This is of vital importance today, not least through cultural tourism which adds �38m to the economy, but it is of equal importance to preserve these treasures for future generations."
They urged "key players" such as the DCMS, the National Museums and Galleries, English Heritage and the National Trust to come together "to ensure that our descendants don't miss out on their cultural heritage".
The DCMS said it would study the committee's recommendations and respond within two months.
But a spokesman added: "Museums and galleries have received record funding since 1997.
"We give them the money, but it is down to the individual museum to decide how to use it," he said.

On This Day
Ms Greening won the Putney seat for the Conservatives
The Conservative Party needs to send out a clear sense of purpose and a message of hope if it is to return to power, leading party members have said.
Co-chairman Lord Saatchi said it had to spell out what it stood for, while former frontbencher John Bercow MP said it should send out a "positive vision".
Mr Bercow said it needed to reform itself as well as Labour had.
"We've got to look, to sound and to think more like the country that we want to lead," said the Buckingham MP.
'More work needed'
The Conservatives cut into Labour's huge majority on Thursday, winning back 33 parliamentary seats. But they needed to win 160 to form a government.
Lord Saatchi told BBC News: "The most telling statistic I can put to you is the finding that 70%, a huge majority, of the population, agree with the statement: 'It is hard to know exactly what the Conservatives stand for these days'.
"This is a big problem because, as I see it, in all forms of competitive human activity - whether it is in politics or in business or in war - a clear sense of purpose seems to be the prerequisite for success."
Mountain to climb
And Conservative former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind agreed that to connect, the Tories had to inspire both new and old voters with their vision of a "dynamic new Britain".
He told BBC One's The Politics Show: "The Tory party can win the next general election, but by God, it's got a heck of a mountain to climb."
Putney's new Tory MP, Justine Greening, told the show the party had to prove itself an effective opposition, pressing the government on economic stability, if voters were to see it as an alternative government.
The reason they are in the mess they are in...is because Tony is such a formidable politician
Alastair Campbell
All praised the efforts of party leader Michael Howard, who has announced his intention to resign once the party has reviewed its leadership election procedure.
Shadow work and pensions secretary David Willetts said that following the party's third successive defeat, there was a strong mood to recognise its "deep seated problems". But he told the BBC: "I think we are in a better environment than we have been in the past eight years because Michael Howard, to his enormous credit, has given the party unity and discipline. We now need vision and purpose."
However Labour's communications chief Alastair Campbell said the Tories had "flatlined" and offered another explanation for their regular leadership changes. "The reason they are in the mess they are in, one of the big reasons, is because Tony (Blair) is such a formidable politician," he told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost.

1981: Rebel army seizes control in Spain
VIDEO : BBC News reports on the Spanish crisis
Spain is in a state of political confusion after an attempted right-wing coup. This evening about 200 soldiers and members of the paramilitary Civil Guard stormed the lower house of the Spanish Parliament, the Cortes, firing automatic weapons and shouting orders. They took hostage about 350 MPs debating a new government. The group - led by Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero Molina, an officer of the Civil Guard - told all those present to lie down.
Lt Col Tejero then called on the King to make an announcement.
All streets around the building have been sealed off.
The coup plot originated in Valencia, in eastern Spain, under the command of Lieutenant General Jaime Milan del Bosch. A supporter of the late dictator General Franco, the former commander of the elite Brunete Armoured Division near Madrid was recently transferred because of his opposition to the new political order and was suspected of plotting against it.
The general has declared a state of emergency and ordered tanks onto the streets of Valencia.
In Madrid the rebel army took over the radio and TV stations for 90 minutes. They dispersed when riot police arrived on the scene.
Attempts to restore order
The King meanwhile has called on the civil service to take on the role of parliament based at Zarzuela Palace.
The joint chiefs-of-staff issued a communiqu� saying all measures had been taken to put down the rebellion and restore order.
Despite these reassurances Spaniards are now wondering how long their five-year democracy can last.
Although Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy has been fairly smooth - until now - there have been rumblings of discontent among the right. A few weeks ago Spain's first democratically elected prime minister Adolfo Suarez resigned. It is believed he was under pressure by the right wing of his Democratic Centre Union party and the armed forces about concessions made to separatists in Catalonia and the Basque regions.
In Context
Early the following day, King Juan Carlos appeared on national TV to tell the people he had ordered the armed forces to take all necessary measures to put down the coup.
The rebel forces and their leaders surrendered and released their captives 22 hours after the siege of the Cortes had started.
The revolt was further damaged by the coup generals' failure to drum up support from other army units around the country.
One more plot was foiled when a group of colonels was discovered planning to seize power on the eve of the October 1982 general election. The Spanish government was involved in a long-running campaign against the violence of the Basque separatist group Eta. The group declared a permanent ceasefire on 22 March 2006. But in December 2006 a bomb went off at Madrid's airport leaving two people missing, presumed dead. Eta was blamed for the attack. In January 2007, the Spanish Government declared the peace process "broken, liquidated, finished".

Singh set to seal Quakers control
New owner Raj Singh will own 100% of the club and the stadium
Teesside businessman Raj Singh is set to take over at Darlington, just a week after former chairman George Houghton revealed he was returning to the post.Once the deal is passed through Singh will become chairman and will obtain 100% control of the club and stadium. Singh will also own 50% of the land surrounding the stadium, with Houghton retaining possession of the other half. The new owner has also confirmed that the future of new manager Colin Todd is also secure under the new regime. Darlington's future looked in doubt when Houghton placed the club in administration in February 2009. The club were docked 10 points by the Football League which effectively ended their hopes of a play-off spot in League Two, and a new buyer was sought by the administrators.
606: DEBATE
Give your reaction to Singh's Quakers takeover bid After three months in administration, only Singh had registered an interest in obtaining control. But he then withdrew his offer in April of this year after he described the terms offered by the administrators Brackenbury Clark and Company as "unrealistic" and "unworkable". Houghton's decision in May to re-establish control of the club, and make the move to bring the club out of administration appeared to be the end of the tale. However Singh's re-emergence suggests that Houghton will finally concede his share in the club, just a week after committing himself to the running of the business. The club are expected to confirm the takeover this week.
