Philippine rescuers find bodies
Rescuers are still battling against desperate conditions
Rescue work has entered a third day at a Philippines village destroyed by a landslide, with teams holding little hope of finding any more survivors.
Almost 70 bodies have been recovered but 1,800 people are missing after Guinsaugon, on Leyte island, was buried under 10 metres (30 feet) of mud. Local officials say the focus is now on recovering bodies and aiding survivors.
No survivors have been found since Friday, and rescue efforts are being hit by rain and fear of new landslides.
In a separate incident, five people are feared dead, one reportedly a child, in a new landslide on Saturday night in Zamboanga del Sur, another part of the Philippines. A total of 10 people were reported missing in the Bayog town of the province.
Treading carefully
A detachment of US marines in the Philippines for exercises arrived in the area on Sunday, and two warships are scheduled to arrive in the area to boost the aid effort later in the day.
Another 11 villages in the area have been evacuated.

In pictures: Hopes fading
Was logging a factor?
One of the main search areas still being searched is a school where 200 students and teachers are thought to be buried. Volunteers with an aid group called Maayo have been digging in vain for signs of life at the site, with the help of two sniffer dogs, according to news agency Associated Press.
Up to 30 US marines are also reported to have joined the trawl for survivors in Guinsaugon, advising rescue workers to tread carefully in the soft mud or risk drowning.
The BBC's Sarah Toms at the scene in Guinsaugon says rescue efforts are continuing even though hopes are fading that any more survivors will be found.
Two more bodies were recovered on Sunday morning, but that is dwarfed by the numbers still missing.

Two US warships - the USS Essex and the USS Harper's Ferry - are due to reach Southern Leyte on Sunday.
The Red Cross has launched an appeal for money and more aid.
A rescue worker told the BBC News website teams had hauled bodies and traumatised survivors from mud, which was waist-deep in parts of the devastated area.
Officials said the mudslide happened after about 200cm of rain (79 inches) fell in the area in the space of 10 days. Correspondents say the area lies in the path of several typhoons each year, and that coconut trees - which are common locally - have shallow roots which leave the soil vulnerable to landslides.
Southern Leyte Governor Rosette Lerias said many residents had left last week, fearing landslides, but had begun to return as rains eased in the past few days.

Video games need 'realism boost'
By Mark Ward
Technology correspondent, BBC News website, San Diego
Games like Crysis are hoping to push the boundaries of realism
More than good looks are needed to make a great video game, according to Glenn Entis, chief technical officer at games giant Electronic Arts.
Mr Entis told the Siggraph conference that games makers had to use much more than graphics to make their creations believable, engaging and fun.
Game worlds must not just look lifelike, he said, they must also react in a realistic manner too.
Tools that let players create content were also becoming important, he said.
Siggraph, held in San Diego, is the world's leading computer graphics conference.
During his speech, Mr Entis warned against assuming that games which look lifelike automatically take on the characteristics of the real world.
He said this problem was most acute when creating believable human video game characters.
Exquisitely sensitive
Humans were so exquisitely sensitive to how other people move and behave, said Mr Entis, that the smallest differences undermine the almost perfect physical representations of people becoming possible on next-generation consoles such as the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
"When a character's visual appearance creates the expectation of life and it falls short your brain is going to reject that," he said.
Improvements in graphics would not boost believability, he said. "Just adding polygons makes it worse."
He said that to add authenticity EA had made extensive use of motion capture to catalogue how stance, gait and the tiny movements of facial muscles combine when people display different emotions.
Every part of nature that can respond will respond
Glenn Entis, EA
Using this, he said, the game maker had created a movement system for characters that unites these gross and fine-grained changes.
"It gives us alertness and empathy that we have never really had in our games before," he said.
"Model and motion are what gives fidelity for non-interactive characters," said Mr Entis, "but it is responsiveness and intelligence that really brings them alive."
"Players have to relate to the characters they are holding in the palm of their hand," he said.
Movement matching
The emotion and movement matching system was going to get its first airing in the next release of EA's basketball game, NBA Live.
Similar demands held true for game worlds as well as the characters that inhabit them, said Mr Entis.
Game worlds must also react in a lifelike manner to whatever people do, he said. Often this can be done via good physics that dictates how scenery reacts when blown up or how liquids or gases move to produce an engaging, thrilling game.
"Every part of nature that can respond will respond," he said.
Mr Entis said the forthcoming Crysis title was a good example of a game in which the responsiveness of the world made it more fun to play.
"It's about worlds that look beautiful but behave beautifully as well," said Mr Entis.
Finally, he said, easy to use tools for players were growing in importance and in some cases had become as important as the gameplay itself.
EA research
For example, he said, EA research had revealed that more than half the people that played The Sims spent more than half the time they play it just making stuff - be it characters or game extras such as furniture.
"They love making the stuff so much that it becomes the game," he said.
EA was now working on a European Xbox 360 title called Virtual Me that gives players unprecedented control over the looks and wardrobe of the character they create. The game will be released alongside a TV programme put together by Big Brother creator Endemol.
The move by the games industry to give players more tools, such as the much-anticipated Spore game by Sim City creator Will Wright, was like the trend towards user-generated content seen on the web, said Mr Entis.
"It's an exploding area," he said.

Interesting Times - 30 years of Steve Davis at the Crucible
By Bryn Palmer
If Steve Davis has his way, he will still be competing at the Crucible, or wherever the World Championship is held, as a pensioner.
Thirty years after the shy, flame-haired 21-year-old first strode into the Sheffield theatre synonymous with snooker, he returns on Tuesday for a record 29th appearance. "Somewhere down the line I'd like to be walking round the table and have my first fall," he jokes as he contemplates his remarkable longevity in the game. "It happened to Fred Davis [three-time world champion from 1948-51] at about 70, and he was still playing at that age. "It is a challenge to keep yourself as good as you can while the standard keeps getting better." At 51, it is a challenge Davis shows no sign of ducking. It may be 20 years since the last of his six world titles, 14 since his last ranking tournament win, or 12 since his last major title, but 'The Nugget' shows no signs of wanting to leave the stage just yet. "I still enjoy the game," he told BBC Sport. "I don't perhaps love it as much, and am not as 100% committed, as I used to be, but it still fascinates me as a game. "There are challenges in staying in a game as you get older. It is not a case of how you keep going as much as possibly how much game play you still have left in you. Even though I may have won the event six times, I look at myself as a complete underdog and am enjoying it as a sort of second coming
Steve Davis
"From my perspective it is out of my hands as to how long I stay in the game to some degree. There will come a time when the younger element and the game has progressed so far that it doesn't matter what I do on the table, it just won't be good enough." As things stand, Davis is still good enough to be judged the 24th best player in the world, according to the provisional rankings, up from 29 at the start of the season. He dropped out of the top 16 for a second time at the end of last season, having originally lost his place among the elite from 2000 to 2002, but the motivation to compete with the best remains strong. "I think it is a cop-out to say you can't be as motivated and dedicated any more, and you lose concentration because it doesn't matter as much anymore and there are other things in your life. "In reality, in a game where you are allowed to be in it for a lot longer than other sports, because it is a non-physical game, other things happen. 606: DEBATE
Who do you think will win this year's World Championship?
"It may not be so obvious because it is a non-physical game, but it relies on quite fine muscle control. As you get older, physically that becomes harder, especially when there is tension involved. "It is the same with golf. The first thing that goes is the putting because that is the fine-tuning bit, and it is the same with snooker. "While you might use it as a defence that you are not as motivated, actually, your body - like everybody else - is falling to pieces from the age of 20 and you are struggling to keep control of it. "So to be at the World Championship and pitting myself against some of the greatest players that have ever held a cue, when we have strength in depth now like you wouldn't believe, I am quite proud. "Even though I may have won it six times, I look at myself as a complete underdog and am enjoying it as a sort of second coming." Where Davis is concerned it is more of a third, or fourth, coming. STEVE DAVIS AT THE CRUCIBLE

Overall record:
Played 80 Won 58 Lost 22
He won the title at the third attempt, in 1981. After suffering the "Crucible Curse" of champions, losing in the first round - 10-1 to Tony Knowles - the following year, he reached seven finals in a row from 1983, winning another five. By the end of the 1980s, he had won 40 matches out of 45 at The Crucible, his sixth title at the age of 31 bringing a record margin of final victory - 18-3 - against his fellow TV analyst John Parrott. That was 20 years ago. Davis remained a contender until the mid-1990s, reaching the semi-finals in three of the next five years. But the phenomenal interest in snooker he helped to create, and the subsequent rise in emerging players capable of winning tournaments, hastened his own descent from the top. At 42, when he finally dropped out of the elite in 2000, 'The Ginger Magician' could easily have slipped into retirement, his legacy as one of the all-time greats long assured. But after two years of failing to qualify for the World Championship, Davis was back at the Crucible in 2003, and every year since. He reached the quarter-finals in 2005, and later that year went on to reach the final of the UK Championship, his 100th career final, only to lose to rising Chinese star Ding Junhui, 30 years his junior. Despite dropping out of the elite again 12 months ago, meaning he had to qualify this year, he is far from a spent force. This season he reached the quarter-finals of consecutive ranking tournaments - the Shanghai Masters and the Grand Prix in Glagow - for the first time since 1996. In the latter tournament, he overcame Neil Robertson 5-4 in a nervous final-frame decider. The Australian, ranked 10th, just happens to be his first-round opponent in Sheffield. You can have all the music and smoke you like but when you get down to it, it is a game of snooker with balls on a table, and if you don't like that, you don't like it
Steve Davis
At a time when the future of snooker is uncertain, the enduring presence of Davis - when contemporaries such as Jimmy White (aged 46) and Parrott (44) are no longer in the top 50 - is a reassuring one. So does he endorse Ronnie O'Sullivan's view that the game is "dying" on its feet, and in need of a radical shake-up? "I would say the game has reached the ultimate peak it was ever going to reach in the UK, but interestingly in certain parts of Europe and China, the game has an 80s-style feel to it," he notes. "The people watching are very motivated by what they see. "I think the British public don't watch as much as they used to. Possibly they have moved on, or they just don't watch as much television as they used to, but I don't think the game needs a major overhaul. It would be nice obviously for sponsorship to be better, but then every sport is struggling in that department. "You can have all the music and smoke you like but when you get down to it, it is a game of snooker with balls on a table, and if you don't like that, you don't like it." Davis does, and is still rather good at removing them from the table. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
