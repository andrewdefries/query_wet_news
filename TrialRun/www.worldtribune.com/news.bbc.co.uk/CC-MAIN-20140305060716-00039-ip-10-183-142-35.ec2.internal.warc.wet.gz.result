South Africa sees future in 3G
By Jon Cronin
BBC News Online business reporter
Vodacom has been investing heavily in 3G technology
After much hype - and some setbacks - third generation (3G) mobile phone technology appears ready to sweep the world.
Millions of Japanese phone users have already snapped up high speed 3G handsets, which allow video calling and faster internet download speeds.
In Europe, operators such as Vodafone and Orange are launching their own 3G networks.
Now South Africa's biggest mobile phone company, Vodacom, is preparing to roll-out a 3G service which could rival much of what Europe has to offer.
The company, which is majority owned by South Africa's monopoly fixed-line operator Telkom and British mobile phone giant Vodafone, has set itself the ambitious target of a Christmas launch date.
Resorts targeted
Vodacom's foray into the world of 3G will be the first such step in South Africa, and indeed anywhere else in Africa.
But it very nearly didn't happen.
"3G was put on hold when we saw what the European operators were paying for their licences." says Vodacom's chief operating officer, Pieter Uys.
South African mobile firms balked as Europe's biggest operators spent billions securing government licences to start 3G services. In the UK alone, Vodafone spent almost �6bn ($10.9bn) acquiring its 20-year 3G licence.
But as the potential benefits of 3G became clear, a decision was taken by government ministers to make 3G licences more affordable in South Africa. Vodacom and rival mobile operator MTN were both awarded licences.
WHERE VODACOM OPERATES
Africa's biggest mobile phone operator
12.4 million customers in five countries
95% mobile network coverage in South Africa
"We paid six million rand for our licence," says Mr Uys. "We are building the network now and all the major metropolitan and holiday areas, such as Sun City, will be covered. 3G will be available by Christmas."
Working closely with Vodafone, which owns a 35% stake in Vodacom, the South African firm has spent 500m rand ($76m; �42m) developing 3G and upgrading its existing network. Risky business South Africa is one of the few countries in Africa where introducing 3G could make commercial sense.
The country's mobile penetration rate - the proportion of the population using mobile phones - currently stands at 40%, compared with an average level across Africa of just 6%.
As well as providing phone services, Vodacom sees 3G as a way of furthering the reach of the internet in South Africa, especially in less wealthy or remote areas of the country.
The company's remit requires it to take mobile technology into poverty stricken areas, and it sees scope for providing subsidised 3G services in schools and community centres.
Africa is a hugely untapped market. I think that mobile Africa will definitely grow, and the future of Africa is a wireless one
Lara Srivastava, International Telecommunications Union
Q&A: 3G mobile phones
However, building a 3G network from scratch is a risky business.
Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa recently revealed it had booked a first-half net loss of $1.1bn (�600m) on its 3G business, despite rising customer numbers.
Hutchison has pumped more than $22bn into its '3' mobile brand in Europe and South Asia, but the service is not expected to make money for some time.
In South Africa, MTN has voiced a more cautious line on the roll-out of 3G. It has been focusing on developing an enhanced version of current mobile technology - known as 'Edge' - and is not expected to launch 3G services until later next year. 'Untapped market'
"Affordability is going to be the biggest problem. Only a certain strata of society is going to be able to afford 3G phones to start with," says Lara Srivastava, telecom policy analyst with the Swiss-based International Telecommunications Union.
Despite the smiles, 3G has had its share of difficulties
However, as the technology develops - becoming more widely available and cheaper to use - Ms Srivastava believes there could be greater benefits for many South Africans.
"There is clearly a need for internet connection in areas where there is no internet infrastructure. 3G offers the potential of bringing internet access to people who can't afford PCs," she says.
"Africa is a hugely untapped market. I think that mobile Africa will definitely grow, and the future of Africa is a wireless one."
Vodacom plans to attract corporate customers with 3G PC plug-in cards, similar to those recently introduced by Vodafone and Orange in Europe.
At the same time, High Street consumers will be targeted with video mobile phone services.
Pan-African reach
Such is Vodacom's faith in 3G, it is predicting the service will account for 10% of revenues by 2007. The company has 12.4 million customers, the vast majority of whom use pay-as-you-go services.
"People are very proud in South Africa," says Mr Uys. "They buy the best shoes and the best clothes. It's important to have the best. What mobile communications have done is enable them to empower their own businesses."
Vodacom's bullish optimism for the roll-out of 3G extends to its operations elsewhere in Africa, including Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Mr Uys says the company could launch 3G services across Africa as early as "next year".
"People want to know what's happening in the rest of the world and we don't want to be left behind." E-mail this to a friend

Author Alan Sillitoe dies in London aged 82
Alan Sillitoe was still working up until his death
The author Alan Sillitoe has died aged 82 at Charing Cross Hospital in London, his family has said.The Nottingham-born novelist emerged in the 1950s as one of the "Angry Young Men" of British fiction. His son David said he hoped his father would be remembered for his contribution to literature. His novels included Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, both of which were made into films. The two books are regarded as classic examples of kitchen sink dramas reflecting life in the mid 20th century Britain. He was born on 4 March 1928 - the second son of an illiterate tannery labourer who was often out of work. Rejected celebrityLater, he described life growing up in a poor household. "We lived in a room in Talbot Street whose four walls smelled of leaking gas, stale fat and layers of mouldering wallpaper," he said. He said his mother burned his first semi-fictional work when he was a 12-year-old. It was about the behaviour of his cousins but she felt it to be too "revealing".
ANALYSIS
By Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor
Alan Sillitoe's name was made with his first two novels. For the next 50 years he continued to write prodigiously, but nothing he subsequently wrote matched their popularity.
That's not to say his form dipped, just that his early subject matter captured the moment of a nation in flux. The establishment the protagonists in his early novels were rebelling against was under attack in real life too. Post-war austerity was starting to give way to youth culture.His social realist writing was categorised as "kitchen sink" drama, meaning Sillitoe was grouped among the Angry Young Men generation of British writers. This was a classification he always rejected - a sentiment echoed in the famous words spoken by Arthur Seaton in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning: "Whatever people say I am, that's what I'm not". A line picked up by the Arctic Monkeys. He then left school at 14 to work in the Raleigh bicycle factory in his hometown before joining the Royal Air Force (RAF) four years later. He worked as a wireless operator in Malaya but, while in the RAF, he contracted tuberculosis and spent 16 months in hospital where he began to write novels. After travelling to France, Spain and Majorca - where he met the poet Robert Graves - he wrote the pioneering novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. Published in 1958, the tale about the life of hard-working factory employee Arthur Seaton won the Authors' Club First Novel Award and received instant critical acclaim. It was adapted as a film in 1960, starring Albert Finney. His story The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, focusing on a rebellious boy with a talent for running, won the Hawthornden Prize in 1959. It was also turned into a film, starring Tom Courtenay, in 1962. The award-winning writer was married to the American poet Ruth Fainlight, with whom he had David, and adopted daughter Susan. Although he tended to spend most of his time in London, they also lived in France, Spain, Tangier and Israel. Poet Ian McMillan paid tribute to the author, describing him as a "marvellous prose stylist" whose work had a "kind of Midlands sonority to it".

Alan Sillitoe: Your memories
"He was a man who attempted to capture the majesty and drama of ordinary life," he said. "He wrote this great line which said 'the art of writing is to explain the complications of the human soul with the simplicity that can be universally understood' and I think that's what he achieved." Sillitoe rejected the celebrity life and all he wanted to do "was sit in his house in London and write and write and write", he added. As well as numerous novels he published several volumes of poetry, children's books and was the author of several stage and screen plays. In 1995, his autobiography Life Without Armour was well received. In 2007, he published Gadfly - an account of his travels in Russia. In 2008, he was recognised for his Nottingham roots and given freedom of the city.

Earlier this month, along with others with the same honour he was due to herd sheep across Trent Bridge, as was his right. However he had to pull out because of illness. Last year, he appeared on the BBC's Desert Island Discs, where he said if he were cast away his ideal companions would be a record of Le Ca Ira sung by Edith Piaf, a copy of the RAF navigation manual, The Air Publication 1234, and a communications receiver - but for receiving only. Although he once said he preferred to be thought of as a poet rather than a novelist, it was his prose that attracted the more critical success.

Milosevic helps friend tie the knot
Scheveningen: Many of the comforts of home
When it comes to choosing your best man, Slobodan Milosevic would perhaps not be the first choice.
He is in a UN jail facing genocide charges.
But for Predrag Banovic, Mr Milosevic was number one choice and available.
For Mr Banovic is spending time with the former Yugoslav president at the UN jail near The Hague.
Milosevic: Missing own wife No-one knows what the stag night was like, but the pair may have been struggling to find anything apart from the wedding to celebrate.
Mr Banovic, 32, alias "Cupo", is indicted over atrocities committed at the Keraterm camp in north-western Bosnia in the summer of 1992 where he served as a guard.
He was arrested last November in Belgrade along with his
twin brother Nenad, who was released by judges last month for lack of evidence.
Mr Milosevic is currently on trial for more than 60 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for his involvement in the wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo in the 1990s. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
Visit denied
The ceremony took place on Saturday at the UN detention unit in the coastal town of Scheveningen.
Although other details are scarce, officials revealed that it was the second time that a war crimes suspect has been married in the jail.
But while Mr Banovic may have enjoyed his nuptials, Mr Milosevic is missing his own wife.
In February he complained to the international war crimes tribunal that Mira Markovic had been denied a visa to visit him at the detention centre.
Inmate massage
Apart from the marital bed, Mr Milosevic is enjoying many of the comforts of home.
Inmates each have their own cell of 15 square metres, equipped with modern conveniences. These include shower, toilet, washbasin and bed - as well as a desk, a coffee maker, bookshelves, a radio set and satellite television. Detainees spend much of their time outside their rooms, and have access to a fully equipped gym, an outdoor courtyard, a library, a recreation room, a prison shop and a religion room for prayer.
Their physical and emotional well-being is cared for by doctors and psychiatrists, and if someone needs a massage, that is provided as well. Full coverage

Can a little radiation be a good thing?
By Michelle Roberts
BBC News Online health staff
Scientists disagree about what levels are damaging
It is widely accepted that high doses of radiation are harmful and can cause cancers like leukaemia. The aftermath of atomic bomb explosions and fallout from nuclear weapons tests and radiation accidents are proof of this. But some experts believe a little radiation may actually be good for you.
They say low-dose exposure to radiation, such as through x-rays and other medical scans, could have a positive effect on the body, in addition to diagnosing diseases.
But others, including experts who advise the government on radiation levels, say any exposure could increase the chance of cancer.
Dr Paul Dubbins from the Royal College of Radiologists explained: "The scientific community sits on exactly opposite sides of the divide. "And both groups have scientific evidence and reports to support their position so it depends on which side of the scientific divide you sit."
So who should you believe?
Dr Dubbins said: "In this country, what we have done is use the data predominantly derived from Hiroshima and the incidence of cancers and leukaemias from people exposed to radiation during Hiroshima.
The most sensible scientific judgement you can make is that any level is harmful.
Dr Michael Clarke from the National Radiological Protection Board
"If you extrapolate that information backwards you assume that there is a linear response with no threshold - that any dose of radiation is theoretically bad for you unless it can be balanced against the benefits that you will get from a diagnosis.
"So we will use radiation only if it is justified by the clinical symptoms and clinical presentation.
"Because of that approach, to reducing the impact of radiation, this country has had the lowest rate of radiation-induced cancer. "So in a sense, you takes your pick and you has your choice.
What are the risks?
Researchers, who published their work in The Lancet medical journal in January, calculated that the additional radiation exposure from medical X-ray tests would increase a UK person's cumulative risk of developing cancer by the age of 75 by 0.6%. This is equivalent to around 700 of the 124,000 new cases of cancer diagnosed in the UK every year.
Dr Michael Clarke from the National Radiological Protection Board, which advises the government about safe radiation levels, said: "We know radiation damages a cell's DNA. Ionising radiation
It is the energy produced from natural and man-made radioactive materials
It is present in the environment because of naturally occurring radioactive minerals
Man-made sources include medical treatments and diagnostic aids, industry and fallout from previous nuclear weapon explosions and other accidents/incidents world-wide.
Source: National Radiological Protection Board
"The problem is that, with low doses, it is difficult to do any experiments on animals or humans so we are basing things on our assumptions.
"The most sensible scientific judgement you can make is that any level is harmful because that mechanism of damage to DNA will happen even if only one cell is hit. "We think that's not a particularly good thing. But of course it is a tiny risk."
Professor Zbigniew Jaworowski, former chairman of a United Nations committee on radiation effects, disagrees. He said a study in the Iranian city of Ramsar had shown people routinely exposed to 250mSv - which was much higher than the 70mSv recommended as a safe background level of exposure in the UK at the time - came to no harm. "There were many generations of people living in these houses, and there was no evidence of any harm. One of the gentlemen living there was more than 100 years old."
'Good radiation'
Professor Jaworoski said the view that low levels of radiation were harmful was little more than an "administrative assumption". There's no doubt in my mind that radiation at moderate levels is beneficial.
Professor John Cameron, professor emeritus from the University of Wisconsin-Madison
Professor John Cameron, professor emeritus from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, believes low levels may actually be beneficial to a person's health, boosting the body's immune system which fights off infections.
"It's been known for some time that radiation stimulates the immune system. "Studies show animals live longer with an increase of radiation.
"I believe a 100-year study of British radiologists is the most important study of health effects of moderate dose rate radiation ever published."
It compared the death rates of British radiologists, who registered with a radiological society between 1897 and 1979, from cancer, non-cancer and all causes to those of all male non-radiologist physicians in England and Wales. I do not think we will ever be closer to knowing for sure.
Professor Adrian Dixon, clinical director of Radiology at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge
Professor Cameron said: "There was no evidence of an effect of radiation on diseases other than cancer even in the earliest radiologists, despite the fact that doses of the size received by them have been associated with more than a doubling in the death rate among the survivors of the Japanese atomic bombings.
"There's no doubt in my mind that radiation at moderate levels is beneficial.
"The trouble is none of these studies prove scientifically that it is the case because we would need to do a randomised controlled study - expose some people to radiation and others not."
He said this would be hard to do in practice because of the ethical problems it would pose. "So the evidence is anecdotal, but it's strong," he said.
Professor Adrian Dixon, clinical director of Radiology at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, disagrees. "There's a bit of very tenuous research which doesn't really outweigh the potential catastrophe. "It's curious that these is not a greater variation of cancer in places with high background radiation. "But equally, they do not do any better so that doesn't suggest that low dose is good for you either. "I do not think we will ever be closer to knowing for sure."

Nasa says Mars assault is on
A montage of Nasa Mars missions for the next decade
By Dr David Whitehouse
BBC News Online science editor
We are doing precisely what we need to do to send humans to Mars, Dr James Garvin, Nasa's senior Mars scientist, has told BBC News Online. The underground ice is a remarkable discovery and the big question is: 'Is this the tip of the iceberg?' Dr James Garvin
Dr Garvin is a researcher with an impressive track record in exploring the Red Planet and he is excited and inspired by the discovery of vast underground water-ice reservoirs on Mars. Scientists have discovered there is so much ice beneath the surface in the polar regions of Mars that if it were to melt it would deluge the planet. But where does this discovery fit in with the long-term exploration of the Red Planet, and what are the prospects of sending humans to Mars? 'Unprecedented assault'
If you think that the Mars Odyssey discovery of water is dramatic then, according to Dr Garvin, there is much more to come. Mars water facts
Ice crystals less than one metre (three feet) below Mars surface
Located south of 60 degrees latitude
Melted, would create planet-wide ocean 500 metres deep
Nasa may commit to landing in less than 20 years
"What we have is an unprecedented assault on Mars," Dr Gavin said.
"We have even more contact with the planet than we did with the Moon before humans went there. "We have missions at every launch opportunity through to 2009 and plans to increase the pace of exploration into the next decade," he added. The next few missions will be surface rovers and advanced survey craft observing from orbit. In 2004, Nasa hopes to place a mobile laboratory on to the surface, looking for what it calls are "chemical fossils" to trace the history and movement of water across the planet. Dr Garvin says Nasa programme is 'the right antecedent for man on Mars '
Because of these mission, by the end of the decade, we may have mineralogical maps of Mars that are better than those of the Earth. We should also have a much improved understanding of Martian weather, particularly on scales that would matter to human visitors. "Mars is not the Moon. There are planetary dynamics there that blow away anything we have on the Moon," says Dr Garvin. "The planet is changing - exchanging gasses with itself - the weather systems are dynamic. The temperature variations are extreme."
By 2009, Nasa hopes to have the capability for pinpoint landings and the ability to roam many tens of kilometres across the surface. Mars sample return
But James Garvin's biggest challenge is to bring a piece of the planet back to Earth. Signs of recent water flowing on Mars
"We have meteorites from Mars but my biggest task is to bring back a fresh piece of Mars. We know we need samples." But when?
"As soon as it is technically feasible. We have to do our homework and develop the technology we need. It will take us a decade. But when we can we will do it," he said. But what about sending humans to Mars? Sean O'Keefe, Nasa's new Administrator, has a vision that human explorers will move out into deep space. "That's a vision not a programme, but I ask, 'what is the difference between what we are doing on Mars now and the preparation we would have to do for a manned Mars mission'. The answer is nothing. "Our unmanned exploration of Mars is just the homework we need to be doing for any eventual manned mission. This programme is the right antecedent for man on Mars." Dr Garvin points out that other areas of Nasa will be looking into the technologies needed to propel humans across interplanetary space, keep them alive in space and bring them back home. And he is keen to put talk of a programme to put men on Mars into perspective. "We will go but let's be sure what we are doing. It is a distance 1,500 times further than the distance to the Moon. In the history of human exploration there has never been such a leap as we will take from the Moon to Mars. "To do it, we need to know more, develop better technology, and understand Mars better. That is what we are doing." Mars OdysseyIce reservoirs Early findingsFirst Mars pictureHydrogen foundFacts and figures

Virtual country 'nuked' on Net
Connect-Ireland's Website now carries only a simple condemnation
By Internet Correspondent Chris Nuttall
The Indonesian Government is being blamed for a highly-organised attack on computers in Ireland which brought down the East Timor virtual country domain.
Connect-Ireland says it is lodging a formal protest with the Indonesian Embassy in London after it was forced to shut down its systems, disrupting its Internet service provision to 3,000 customers.
The cracker attacks, perhaps the first of their kind orchestrated by a government, began last Tuesday and, after a week, the domain guardian and Internet Service Provider was still struggling to restore its services.
"E-Nazis" create chaos
Only its home page was accessible, containing a statement headlined: E-Nazis Creating Chaos on the Net. "The apparent aim of the attack was to disrupt the East Timorese Internet domain [.tp], established only twelve months ago by the East Timorese Project, " said the statement.
Bishop Belo: Initiated virtual countryThe project was initiated by Connect-Ireland and the 1996 Nobel Prize winners Ramos Horta and Bishop Belo. The main site, www.freedom.tp returned a 404 Not Found error message on Tuesday. "The perpetrators of this attack have not yet been identified, but the Indonesian government is known to be extremely antagonistic towards this display of virtual sovereignty," said the statement.
Robots mounted 18 attacks
Connect-Ireland's project director, Martin Maguire, told BBC News Online that e-mail for customers was now being delivered and new passwords were being issued.
BBC's Ireland correspondent, Leo Enright, reports from DublinHe said crackers had been testing the servers' defences for the past nine months before launching lightning simultaneous attacks from countries as far apart as Australia, Japan, Holland and the United States.
"There were 18 simultaneous attacks on our server by robots trying to claw down our defences," said Martin.
"This was a very high-level attack that had to be planned and co-ordinated."
Once they had broken in, the crackers set up their own domain host, need.tp, with the possible aim of using it for fund-raising or propaganda on East Timor.
A new style of war
Connect-Ireland responded with its "nuclear option" of a complete shutdown. "We have re-invented ourselves in the space of a week, moving platforms, using other versions of software on new hardware," said Martin.
He said other services in Japan and the United States had been hit by similar attacks but were not reporting them for fear of bad publicity. "This is the ostrich nature of the industry. But it's going to be the new style of war. You can see these tactics becoming part of official government policy and a potential weapon." "And it can take place against real countries. Probably no government has contingency plans for this, no government has mandatory reporting of such incidents and there is no plan for managing the problem."
There was no-one available for comment at the Indonesian Embassy in London on Tuesday.
This story has prompted a long discussion thread on the Slashdot "News for Nerds" site. One of the theories put forward is that those directly responsible were fans of the Beavis and Butthead cartoon as the need.tp address could refer to an "I need tp [toilet paper]" line from an episode. Martin Maguire responded he could not see ordinary crackers expending their energy for nine months on testing defences and then mounting a worldwide co-ordinated campaign.

Flight ban hits Slimbridge wild cranes project
The chicks will be trained to live in the wild at 'crane school'
A project to re-establish wild cranes in Somerset has been hit by flight restrictions introduced because of the volcanic ash cloud over the UK.The eggs were being collected by a team in Germany to be hatched and raised at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire. Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) expert Nigel Jarrett has now hired a car to drive and fetch the eggs after flights from the UK were cancelled. The eggs need to get to Slimbridge in time for hatching next week. The intention is to release the birds on the Somerset Levels and Moors. The team was hoping to bring the cargo back to the WWT headquarters by plane on Friday, but fear the travel disruption may mean a non-stop road and boat journey back to the UK. Great crane project manager Damon Bridge said: "This is quite a complex operation so we've had to do some quick thinking to work out a way of getting the eggs back on time and ready for hatching early next week. "So instead of flying them back, it looks as though they will set off on a rather epic road journey across Europe." But he said bird experts from WWT had plenty of experience and the birds would be "just fine" on a road trip in incubators back from Germany. The reintroduction project, which is jointly run by the RSPB, the WWT and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust, will see the chicks reared and trained to live in the wild at "crane school" before being released.

Thaxton beaten in bruising battle
Thaxton knocked down Mezaache early in the fight
Britain's Jon Thaxton lost his European lightweight title to Anthony Mezaache after a thrilling bout on Saturday.
Thaxton, 34, went into the fight at the Norfolk Showground in Norwich as overwhelming favourite but faded badly as his French opponent took control.
Thaxton had the 30-year-old Mezaache on the canvas in the final minute of the opening round with a right hook.
But the fight went the distance, with the judges scoring the bout 115-112 115-111 114-113 in Mezaache's favour.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Despite the defeat, Thaxton refused to give up hopes of a world title shot and claimed he would happily face Mezaache in a Paris rematch.
The Norwich fighter was left to rue the events of the opening round, when Mezaache spat out his gumshield after being knocked down in order to buy some time.
"I dropped him in the first round and he then spat his gumshield out. It could have been over in the first," said Thaxton.
"But full credit to him, he did his homework on me and was very awkward to fight. I just felt I won. I'm the champion and I feel he stole the title rather than won it."

F1 big picture
Our series of photos aimed at showing a different side of Formula 1 continues with an intimate shot of Rubens Barrichello relaxing before the Italian Grand Prix.The photographs are taken by Darren Heath, who over the last 20 years has carved a reputation as one of the best photographers working within the sport. This is Darren's story behind his latest image: "Laid back and chilling out before the storm, Rubens Barrichello has seen it all before, the weathered Monza barriers providing the perfect shaded backrest just minutes before zipping up his race suit, pulling on his balaclava, tightening the chin strap on his helmet, squeezing into his Brawn car and driving 53 perfect race-winning laps of the legendary Italian track. "An F1 grid is a special place and one no-one ever tires of. The level of anticipation is turned up to 10, the cars arrive, the drivers and teams do their last minute checks, television crews thrust microphones this way and that, politicians parade and celebrities pose. Every inch of asphalt is alive with excitement. "Amid all this chaos, the occasional oasis of calm can be found and that's exactly where Barrichello is. "I love working the grid and thrive on the fantastic 20 minutes of opportunity it provides. It is the only time over a grand prix weekend when all the cars, drivers, team members and so on are there to be photographed. "Often I'll have a plan of attack, concentrating on particular areas to work. But at this year's Italian race I just went with the flow. "Moving quickly between cars I had perhaps my best pre-race shoot of the year, bagging great shots of Kimi Raikkonen, Sebastian Vettel, Heikki Kovalainen, Adrian Sutil, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and, of course, Barrichello. "I've known Rubens for almost 20 years so perhaps his easy grin is a reflection of all the shoots we've done together. From the race tracks of the world to his beautiful farm in Brazil he's always been a joy to work with. "Congratulations Rubinho! Camera: Canon EOS1DS Mark3. Lens: 50mm Exposure: 500th sec @ f2.0
