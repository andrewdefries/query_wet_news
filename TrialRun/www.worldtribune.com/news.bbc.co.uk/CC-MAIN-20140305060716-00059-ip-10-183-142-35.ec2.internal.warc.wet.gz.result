Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 'coup plot' warning
Recep Tayyip Erdogan (l) said conspirators "won't get away with it"
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed that conspirators in an alleged plot to sow chaos and provoke a coup will face justice."No one is above law, no one has impunity," he told a gathering of his Justice and Development Party (AKP). His comments came after a further 11 military officers were charged, bringing the total to 31. The case has increased tensions between the military and the government, which is led by the Islamist-rooted AKP. Several suspects were taken to court for questioning on Friday including Gen Cetin Dogan, the former head of Turkey's First Army region. The military has denied any coup plot. "Those conspiring behind closed doors to trample on the nation's will from now on find themselves facing justice," Mr Erdogan said.
ANALYSIS
Jonathan Head, BBC News, Istanbul
After a week of high drama at the state security court in Istanbul, the judges have almost completed their assessment of the 49 military suspects detained on Monday. Thirty-one officers, among them seven navy admirals and four army generals, have been charged with conspiring to provoke a military takeover in the months following the AKP's first election victory in 2002. That makes this the most ambitious attempt yet to prosecute armed forces personnel in civilian courts. Three other officers, including the general who allegedly masterminded the plot, are still being questioned. For the once untouchable military the week's events will have been a humbling experience. But it could have been worse; last night the three most senior officers among the 49 were released.
Plot thickens in Turkey 'coup plan'
Press fears 'coup plot' tensions
"They should know that they won't get away with it," he added. On Thursday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul sought to reassure the country, saying tensions over an alleged military coup plot would be resolved within the "constitution". He made the statement after meeting the head of the armed forces, Gen Ilker Basbug, along with Mr Erdogan. The 11 suspects most recently charged are among more than 49 people detained over the alleged coup plot on Monday, in an operation of unprecedented scale. A total of 31 officers have now been charged and jailed, including seven navy admirals and four army generals. The former heads of the air force and navy and a general were freed on Thursday, having been questioned by prosecutors. The three - retired air force head Ibrahim Firtina, former navy chief Ozden Ornek and former deputy army chief Ergin Saygun - have not been charged but remain under investigation, prosecutors said. A number of others have also been released. Turkey's military has overthrown or forced the resignation of four governments since 1960 - most recently in 1997 - though Gen Basbug has insisted that coups are a thing of the past. Power struggleReports of the alleged "sledgehammer" plot first surfaced in the liberal Taraf newspaper, which said it had discovered documents detailing plans to bomb two Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane over the Aegean Sea. The army has said the scenarios were discussed but only as part of a planning exercise at a military seminar.
HOW 'COUP PLOTS' EMERGED
June 2007: Cache of explosives discovered; ex-soldiers detained
July 2008: 20 arrested, including two ex-generals and a senior journalist, for "planning political disturbances and trying to organise a coup"
July 2008: Governing AK Party narrowly escapes court ban
October 2008: 86 go on trial charged with "Ergenekon" coup plot
July 2009: 56 in dock as second trial opens
Jan 2010: Taraf newspaper reports 2003 "sledgehammer" plot to provoke coup
Feb 2010: More than 40 officers arrested over "sledgehammer"; 20 charged
Turkey's religious-secular divide
Turkish military faces crossroads
The alleged plot is similar, and possibly linked, to the reported Ergenekon conspiracy, in which military figures and staunch secularists allegedly planned to foment unrest, leading to a coup. Scores of people, including military officers, journalists and academics, are on trial in connection with that case. Many Turks regard the cases as the latest stage in an ongoing power struggle between Turkey's secular nationalist establishment and the governing AKP. Critics believe the Ergenekon and sledgehammer investigations are simply attempts to silence the government's political and military opponents. The AK Party has its roots in political Islam, and is accused by some nationalists of having secret plans to turn staunchly secular Turkey into an Islamic state. The government rejects those claims, saying its intention is to modernise Turkey and move it closer to EU membership. "The process underway is painstaking, but it is for the benefit of the people, today's developments are setting free the consciousness of the people," Mr Erdogan said. Are you in Turkey?

Actor Don Estelle dies
Don Estelle played Lofty in the 70s sitcom
The actor and singer Don Estelle has died after a long illness. The diminutive actor, only 4ft 9in tall, starred as Lofty in the 1970s sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum, which was set in Burma during World War II.
In 1975 he had a number one hit with Whispering Grass, dueting with Windsor Davies, who played the bullying sergeant-major in the show. Mr Estelle died, aged 70, in Rochdale Infirmary.
His widow Elizabeth said: "He had a lovely singing voice, he regretted it was not more well known. He had a lovely singing voice, he regretted it was not more well known
Elizabeth EstelleWidow
"He loved singing more than anything but he loved comedy as well.
"He lived absolutely for his showbiz career. He loved his music more than anything."
Choirboy
Born in Manchester, Mr Estelle's career started in the choir of Holy Trinity Church in the town of Darwen, Lancashire, where he had been evacuated to during World War II.
He developed his music and comedic talents, touring first in the north of England club circuit, then throughout the UK when he teamed up with Windsor Davies, who was to become his co-star in It Ain't Half Hot Mum.
He toured New Zealand and Australia repeatedly in the 1990s and continued to appear on stage in the UK. He recently had a cameo appearance in the cult comedy TV show The League of Gentlemen.

Q&A: Inspecting arms in Iraq
A United Nations team is preparing to return to Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction. Former weapons inspector Chris Cobb-Smith, who organised operations in Iraq for two and a half years, answers key questions about the team's mission.
Do the inspectors themselves believe they can do the job effectively ?
Yes, but only if they are given the resources and ultimately, the unconditional backing of the United Nations Security Council. In the past the manipulation and interference of nations has had as much to do with compromising the inspections teams and inhibiting the inspection process as Iraqi obstruction. How do you think they will be feeling as they wait to go in?
Excited but apprehensive, and hopefully confident. On the surface this is "the big one" but I have been in this situation on several occasions before when we have supposedly been embarking on Iraq's last chance, or the "trigger mission", but it has seldom turned out that way.
Hopefully the team will have been well trained, fully briefed and have had the chance to bond together as a unit - so important when going into a confrontational and uncompromising environment. What were the main obstacles you faced last time in Iraq? The most obvious is of course the physical obstruction and denial of access to facilities by the Iraqi authorities. A particular challenge is the security of the mission - which is paramount. Information about the actual targets, and the facilities identified and listed for inspection will be limited to just a couple of individuals. Although there is no rank structure, team members will have to accept that they will be working on a "need to know" basis and the team inspector does not need to know where he is going until the morning of the inspection. If this information has been promulgated already the inspection will have already been compromised.
What do you think will be different this time?
Potentially the finality of the issue and the united resolve of the Security Council. The Americans see war as inevitable and consider it only a matter of time. They are just waiting for the excuse to pull the trigger. There is a lot riding on what the chief arms inspector Hans Blix and his team report back - how much pressure are they under?
Huge pressure. They will come under intense scrutiny by the Americans, who will be doing everything they can to ensure that any obstruction by the Iraqis is seen as just that. Potentially it is a black and white situation: they go to Iraq, they attempt to inspect their target list and have every gate opened to them immediately. If there is any obstruction they report it, return to base, pack and leave the country prior to the initiation of military action. I still can't help feeling that it won't be either - Iraq will throw in something to blur the issue, to play for time and attempt to regain some sympathy from its old friends, Syria, France, Russia.
How will the inspectors choose which sites to visit ?
This should be based on intelligence gathered and analysed over the past four years, and earlier. The size of the team, quoted as upwards of 200, implies that it will be split into a number of elements. One will probably be made up of specialist chemical, biological and missile experts to make baseline inspections of the previously "declared" sites. Another will probably be an intrusive element to act on intelligence and go for the sites where they believe recent proscribed activity may be taking place or where items may be concealed.
In a vast country, how easy is it to hide facilities and stockpiles? Isn't it like looking for a needle in a haystack?
Absolutely, but by careful analysis they should have a good idea where to start. They have had four years to prepare for this mission. If it is not successful, or has shortcomings, serious questions will need to be asked of the very effectiveness and credibility of this department of the United Nations which inspects arms. It has already been revealed that the team does not have not enough CBR (chemical, biological, radiological) protective suits. This in itself questions the preparedness of the team. Full coverage

Oldest hummingbird fossils found
The fossils are strikingly similar to modern hummingbirds
A pair of 30 million-year-old fossils from southern Germany are the oldest fossil hummingbirds, a researcher says.
The location of the finds is unexpected, because today the birds are only known from the Americas.
In the latest edition of Science magazine, Dr Gerald Mayr claims the fossils show many striking resemblances to modern hummingbird groups.
The extinct hummingbirds may have influenced the shape of some modern Asian and African flowers.
Maybe hummingbirds used to have a much wider distribution but - for some reason - they went extinct in the Old World
Gerald Mayr, Senckenberg Natural History Museum
"Fossils of primitive hummingbirds have been found in the Old World before, but it was a great surprise to find a bird that looked so similar to the modern hummingbirds of the Old World," Dr Mayr, of the Senkenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, told BBC News Online.
Other fossil hummingbirds have been found in Central America, Europe and Asia, but they are either very different from modern ones or are known from just a few bones.
The new fossils, which have been assigned to the species Eurotrochilus inexpectatus, were endowed with long, nectar-sucking beaks and wings designed for feeding while hovering.
They share key anatomical features on their wings with modern hummingbirds. The primitive hummingbird Jungornis tesselatus lacks these features. Mystery extinction
This suggests that Eurotrochilus and modern hummingbirds belong together in a distinct group of birds, while Jungornis belongs to another, more primitive group.
"Maybe hummingbirds used to have a much wider distribution but, for some reason, they went extinct in the Old World," said Dr Mayr.
Dr Mayr said he had no idea what caused this extinction.
Professor Ethan Temeles, of Amherst College in Massachusetts, US, speculated that the extinction could have been caused by climate change.
Extinct hummingbirds may have influenced the shape of some plants
"Certainly if you consider the small size of hummingbirds, if there were climatic changes, that might have been the factor responsible," he told BBC News Online.
"If you look at temperate, migratory hummingbirds that are coming up to, for example, Canada - if you end up having a snowstorm early in the year or late in the year, it can kill the population."
But Professor Temeles said that competition between hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding birds might also have been a factor.
Extinct hummingbirds might also have helped determine the shape of some modern Asian and African flowers through a back-and-forth evolutionary process called co-evolution.
These plants may include the species Canarina eminii, Impatiens sakeriana and Agapetes.
"If you take one of the North American species of Impatiens, it has a very long floral tube that's shaped like a trumpet, ending in a nectar tube or spur. "The nectar-containing spur associates with the hummingbird beak to some extent - though not perfectly. At the same time, they contain petals around the flower which suggests they provide a landing platform for bees."
Dr Mayr added: "Botanists now have to look at plants in the Old World to see if any of them show evidence of co-evolving with hummingbirds."

Perhaps it is time to let our children surf during exams, argues Bill Thompson
Is it time to review the way exams are taken?
It is exam time in schools around the UK. My son, aged 14, has SATs all week, while my daughter has GCSE papers from next Tuesday onwards. Some of her friends are locked in the art room for their practical exam today and tomorrow, others still have sore thumbs from last week's textiles practical.
For the art exam, students can take in material they have prepared in advance, like sketches and ideas, but in general anything that might be considered to give an unfair advantage is forbidden.
According to Chailey School in Sussex, this includes "calculator cases/ instruction leaflets, bags, personal TV/stereos, electronic or radio communication devices, including mobile telephones".
Bringing these in counts as cheating, and if your mobile is turned on you will fail the whole course, not just one paper.
This seems reasonable to those who have been through the exam system, but in fact the idea that you can assess someone's knowledge and ability by getting them to sit isolated in a room for three hours regurgitating facts or writing essays from scratch is a peculiar invention of the modern age.
No net access
Computers are integral to most lessons in school
The history of exams was recently explored on BBC Radio 4 in 'Turn over your papers...now!', an entertaining and witty look at the way written papers, essays and multiple choice tests replaced other forms of assessment.
Presented by writer John O'Farrell, it reinforced my view that the way we currently do things has more to do with satisfying the needs of university admission officers and the administrators of the Victorian civil service than helping people show their talents and abilities to the best.
And yet the government has recently announced a move away from coursework for GCSEs because they think it makes it too easy to cheat, and because it privileges those children whose parents offer help and support.
It will be back to pass or fail exams for my son as he embarks on his GCSE Maths, unlike his coursework-laden sister. And although he will be allowed a calculator, he won't be able to use any of the other computational tools that are available.
He may, of course, use a computer to actually sit the exam, but that's a separate matter. Taking multiple-choice tests on a computer is a well-established practice, and though we need to consider the same issues as we do with e-voting, like providing a paper record, it can be made to work.
But he will not have a chance to demonstrate his research skills, or his ability to work with others, or his understanding of the core technology that supports so much of modern life, the internet. System failure?
Today it would be unthinkable to restrict a reporter's access to the net
When I began working at The Guardian newspaper in 1995 there was one internet-connected PC on each floor of the building, except in the online department where I worked. This was considered sufficient for the few occasions on which journalists would want to go there for research, because the Atex terminals had access to an array of online databases.
Today it would be unthinkable to restrict a reporter's access to the net.
Last week my friend Anne had some work done in her front garden, and the gardeners cut through her network cable. This was bad enough for her as a freelance writer, but her daughter - currently taking GCSE art - was distraught and could not be pacified, locked out of the sources she needed to prepare for the crucial practical.
In the end, Ric, our local IT support expert, came through and patched the cable, but it was a close run thing.
And it highlighted for me the way that the exam system fails to acknowledge this important aspect of our children's education. Giving grades for IT as a core skill is not nearly enough; we need to let them show what they can really do online.
Yet school exams do nothing to assess ability in a world where access to computers, the internet and the tools they offer are so embedded in daily life that not being online is unimaginable. I don't think we should completely replace essay questions and three-hour exams. There will always be a need to test knowledge, to try to find out what someone actually knows. But there is an increasing need to find out how someone researches, how they use available resources and how they manage to filter, synthesise and edit the information available to them.
Open book exams are already used around the world, letting students use specific reference materials as research aids. Perhaps it's time we considered open laptop exams too, at least for some papers.

Many councils 'bug' rubbish bins
Councils face tough decisions over what to do with waste
More than 30 councils are fitting microchips to wheelie bins ahead of possible "pay as you throw" schemes.
It is the latest attempt to encourage more recycling to curb the amount of rubbish that ends up in landfill.
Household rubbish would be weighed to within 500 grams on collection trucks and the chips used to identify which property the bin belongs to. Councils are expecting to get the go-ahead from the government to start using the chips to charge residents.
Many local authorities are in favour of "pay as you throw" and are already anticipating the changes, according to the information uncovered by BBC One's Real Story.
CHIP COUNCILS INCLUDE
Alnwick
Crewe and Nantwich
Devizes
Harrow
Hynburn
Peterborough
St Helens
South Norfolk
Woking
But Paul Bettison, chairman of the Local Government Association's environment board, appreciates that certain councils have taken the wrong approach.
"Any council that's issued chipped bins and hasn't informed their residents I would say has scored something of an own goal. We need to work with the public and it's sad that seemingly some councils didn't," he said.
Tough decisions
Once weighed, a bill for the waste would be sent to the owner. Local authorities do not yet have the power to use the chips to charge people but have started introducing them in the expectation that they will be used.
Councils are trying to encourage recycling
The Mail on Sunday reported that an estimated 25,000 chips had been removed by disgruntled residents in Bournemouth.
Mr Bettison told BBC News in August that he expected weighing schemes to be commonplace across the UK within two years.
With an estimated nine years of landfill space left, councils up and down the UK are faced with tough decisions about what to do with the UK's waste. Simply burying rubbish in the ground is no longer an option. Compulsory recycling
Local authorities face tough fines from the government on what they bury and by 2010 they will have to meet 40% of recycling targets to avoid EU sanctions.
In some areas recycling is now compulsory, meaning if people do not comply rubbish will not be cleared away and they could face prosecution.
HAVE YOUR SAY
If I find a bug in my bin it will go straight back to the council offices Andrew Howlett, Manchester Send us your comments
Alternate weekly collections are one way of tackling the problem but they have not been warmly welcomed by residents who say councils need to collect the domestic waste more frequently.
Mr Bettison believes that if people want to keep weekly collections of all household waste they will have to face the reality that it is going to cost them.
"If you wanted us to collect both bins each week that would mean doubling the number of collections and that would add approximately �100 a year to your council tax. "There may be people who wouldn't want to pay that."
Real Story's report on rubbish is on BBC One on Wednesday 4 October at 1930 BST.

Flexible working 'good for heart and soul'
Researchers said the key was workers having control of their hours
People who can choose their own working hours enjoy better physical and mental health, a report has suggested.Researchers for the Cochrane Library found employees who had control of their hours could have better blood pressure and heart rates. Its review of 10 studies of more than 16,000 people also said it might have a positive impact on mental health. Since 2009, parents in the UK with children under 16 have been able to apply for flexible working. Researchers at the Cochrane Library - an organisation which looks at published studies - found the key was workers, rather than employers, having control over their hours. Before April 2009, it was only parents with children under six or disabled children aged up to 18 who could ask employers for flexible work arrangements. The extension meant a total of 10 million parents were now entitled to request flexible working. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the move but it warned that firms may find it difficult to grant requests for flexible working during the downturn. The Federation of Small Businesses said many small firms offered flexible working but working from home did not suit industries such as retail or construction.

Cash for peerages probe widened
The loans for peerages row is under police investigation Police have extended their "cash for peerages" probe to look into loans to political parties as far back as 2001.
The probe was launched amid claims Labour had broken the law preventing the sale of honours, ahead of last year's election. It has since been widened to cover the activities of other parties.
And the Electoral Commission confirmed the inquiry would stretch back five years - potentially covering loans to the Tories under Iain Duncan Smith.
The Electoral Commission said the inquiry was "not specifically limited to current loans". All accounts of the last five years are being looked at.
Last week government adviser Des Smith was arrested as part of the probe.
Mr Smith, a headteacher, was subsequently bailed and will, according to his solicitor, deny allegations against him.
The arrest followed allegations in a Sunday newspaper that he told an undercover reporter posing as the PR of a potential donor that honours could be forthcoming in return for funding for the government's flagship city academies programme.
Levy-headed body
Mr Smith later quit his post with the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust which helps the government recruit education sponsors.
Set up in September 2005, its president is Lord Levy, Tony Blair's chief political fundraiser and close friend. Downing Street has said it is "nonsense to suggest that honours are awarded for giving money to an academy".
The cash-for-honours inquiry was originally launched in response to a complaint by Scottish and Welsh nationalist MPs.
The investigation is being led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Yates, who has said he is prepared to widen the investigation to consider more general allegations of corruption.
It followed reports that the House of Lords Appointments Commission had blocked the appointment of four of Prime Minister Tony Blair's nominations for peerages - all wealthy businessmen who had made loans to Labour. None was on the list of new working life peers when it was published on Monday. One Tory nominee - who had loaned the party �2m - also missed out on a seat in the upper house.
Mr Yates has already told MPs that he is prepared to widen the investigation to consider more general allegations of corruption.

Blues and Reds in Champions glory
Chelsea have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League with a 2-1 win against Romanian champions Cluj.
Salomon Kalou got the opener for Chelsea six minutes before the break at Stamford Bridge, but Yssouf Kone soon headed home an equaliser. It was left to substitute Didier Drogba to net the winner, and help Chelsea finish second in Group A behind Roma.
Elsewhere, Liverpool also had a good night, coming from behind to beat PSV Eindhoven 3-1 to finish top of Group D.

A close range shot from Danko Lazovic gave PSV the lead to the delight of home fans early on, but the Reds equalised within 10 minutes with a Ryan Babel header.
Albert Riera and David Ngog netted the other two goals after the break.

1981: Thatcher gives in to miners
Mrs Thatcher's Conservative Government has withdrawn plans to close 23 pits in its first major u-turn since coming to power two years ago.
President of the National Union of Mineworkers Joe Gormley is confident the government's intervention will avert the threatened national miners' strikes.
Secretary of State for Energy David Howell made the concessions at two hours' of crisis talks in Whitehall involving union leaders and Department of Trade and Industry officials.
At the negotiations - brought forward several days by the government - Mr Howell acknowledged the miners' main demands about coal imports and subsidies to the National Coal Board.
The government agreed to reduce coal imports from eight million to five-and-a-half million tonnes over the next year and to provide more money for the Coal Board, struggling under the withdrawal of operating subsidies after the 1980 Coal Industry Act.
As a result the Coal Board has dropped the programme of pit closures it announced on 10 February.
'Far from satisfied'
Mr Gormley is due to meet the 25-member executive of the NUM tomorrow morning and says he will advise against an indefinite strike by the nation's 240,000 miners.
"I hope the explanation we shall give to the executive will be enough to convince them there is no need for a ballot. The whole situation is different," he explained.
However vice-president of the NUM and leader of the Scottish pitmen Michael McGahey said: "I am very far from satisfied with the meeting, which only amounts to promises to review the situation. "On the real issues there are no concrete agreements."
His views are shared by much of the coal industry's left-wing and over half the country's coalfields are already affected by unofficial strikes.
Further talks between union leaders and Mr Howell are planned for a week today when he will give more precise details of the scale of the government's assistance.
In Context
The next day the NUM told all miners to return to work after the executive voted to accept the concessions made by the government and coal board by 15 to 8, with one abstention.
Some left-wing pits maintained unofficial stoppages and there were pickets outside the NUM headquarters in London.
Militant miners' leaders called off these strikes on 20 February.
The government provided �300m of financial assistance to the industry and prevented official strike action, although pockets of discontent remained.
Joe Gormley resigned as president of the NUM in April 1982 to be replaced by leftwinger Arthur Scargill.
Mr Scargill went on to lead the miners in a year-long strike - the longest ever in the UK - from March 1984, when the Coal Board announced the closure of 20 pits.
