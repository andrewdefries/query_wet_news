Emergency contraception 'should be free'
Doctors want emergency contraception to be free from chemists
By BBC News Online's Caroline Ryan in Bournemouth
Emergency contraception should be available free at pharmacists, doctors have decided.
At the moment, women either have to pay �20 for the emergency contraception over the counter, or go to a GP and obtain a prescription.
At its annual conference in Bournemouth, the British Medical Association voted in favour of the motion that would allow women to access the "morning-after pill" from chemists without having to pay a fee.
However, an impassioned debate saw some doctors argue teenagers needed the counselling and advice, which only a doctor could give.
Kate Duffield, a medical student, said emergency hormonal contraceptive was available, but, at �30 over the Internet, or �20 from the doctor, it was of little use to poor women.
'Discrimination'
Ms Duffield said evidence had shown that the pill, which can be taken up to 72 hours after intercourse, was more likely to be effective the earlier it was taken.
And she said the need for a doctor's appointment meant poorer women may have to wait longer to obtain it than those who could pay.
Urging the conference to back free postcoital contraception, she said: "What we're saying is the less money you have, the more likely you are to stay pregnant.
"The status quo is unequal and discriminatory."
Dr John Chisholm, chairman of the BMA's GPs' committee, said family doctors had supported free emergency hormonal contraception since 1995.
He said evidence showed was most requested by women aged between 25 and 29 - not teenagers.
Dr Alanah Houston, a GP from Milton Keynes, said: "Women on low incomes still
have no option but to try to make an appointment at an overcrowded GP surgery
because they cannot afford the �20 price over the counter."
That was leading to more work for GPs or forcing women to busy hospital
Casualty departments in a bid to get a prescription.
Pills 'not Smarties'
But Dr Helena McKeown, a sexual health doctor who runs after-school clinics, told how she worked in a teenage pregnancy "blackspot", which had recently seen two 13-year-old girls become pregnant.
She said emergency contraception should only be issed following detailed advice from a doctor.
"In my experience, pharmacists do not provide the privacy to say these two little pills are not Smarties, might fail, and will not prevent pregnancy for the rest of the month.
"These young people need to have very clear explanations.
"I am not denigrating the ability of pharmacists to provide advice but this
is not the way to improve sexual health education."
And Tiz North, of the BMA consultants' committee said more efforts should be going into encouraging young people to buy contraception before pregnancy.
She provoked strong criticism by saying: "This motion should have been asking for free condoms to be provided by the pharmacist, rather than free abortion pills."
Dr Gregory Gardner, a GP from Birmingham, warned widening the availability of emergency contraception would do nothing to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections, or protect teenage girls.
Levonelle 2, a progestrogen-only emergency hormonal contraceptive has been available from pharmacists for �19.99 from January.

Science speaks out on bone return
By Robert Pigott
BBC News religious affairs correspondent
A government announcement is expected in the next few weeks
Anthropologists say their discipline may be plunged into crisis if thousands of human remains stored in the UK are sent back to their countries of origin. An advisory group has recommended scientists seek out descendants for permission to retain bones and other body parts up to 500 years old.
A special panel could also be set up to settle cases in which researchers and claiming individuals dispute ownership.
Ministers are expected to announce their position on the issue shortly.
'Obliterated forever'
At the University of Cambridge department of biological anthropology, Professor Robert Foley showed me the laboratory where he and colleagues have worked on bones to map human evolution. In glass cabinets on the wall are a tiny proportion of the 18,000 separate sets of remains held by the university. In cardboard boxes, brought up from the climate-controlled storerooms, are several others, including the 400-year-old skeletons of slender, fleet-footed, hunter-gatherer Native Americans.
It's often rare, from populations that are long gone, which no longer exist, so it's a whole part of the human story that would be obliterated and gone forever
Professor Robert Foley, University of Cambridge
Professor Foley fears that if the recommendations of the Human Remains Working Group currently being considered by ministers are followed up, much of the evidence he has worked with will be lost.
"It would be an enormous blow; one would be losing material that is often unique," he told BBC News Online. "It's often rare, from populations that are long gone, so it's a whole part of the human story that would be obliterated and gone forever." The advisory group said scientists such as Professor Foley should have to examine how the collections held in their institutions came into their possession. They should then have to seek out any possible living descendants to get their permission to keep them or to continue to use them in research. In the absence of living relatives, permission should be obtained from others in the same cultural or belief group. Professor Foley says universities and museums are often unsure exactly where remains came from, and seeking out the nearest thing to descendants would place a crippling burden on researchers.
Report support
Not all anthropologists agree, however. Marilyn Strathern, professor of social anthropology at Cambridge, served on the working group and supported its majority report. Professor Strathern says we live in a political era which prefers to enforce best practice rather than relying on the good intentions of professional people. We also live in a globalised world, and cannot deny the same standards to people overseas, she argues.
"Don't choose this area to start fussing about the accountability and burden of proof and all the rest of it," she added. In the US rows have erupted between scientists and Native people
"It would be almost repeating the past as far as aboriginal cultures are concerned, if we say that in this area we don't need to impose burdens on ourselves."
It is also concern about our past treatment of those indigenous groups in "far-off lands" that has prompted the soul-searching now going on.
"We're thinking of theft of a very brutal nature," said Professor Strathern. "Bodies were dug up from graves, taken off battlefields, butchered on the spot - that's no more or less brutal than what happened here in this country. But that abuse - to borrow a late 20th Century term - that abuse does weigh with people and we need to know they are affected by it."
They are doubly affected, the argument goes, if they belong to cultures which believe that the body leaves an imprint on the place where it lived. And you should not discount such feelings just because - particularly if you live in the West - the fate of the body after death does not mean quite so much anymore.
Sensitive ruling
But the ruling could come at a sensitive moment. Dr Jay Stock relies entirely on studying bone for his work on the diversification of human beings. All of us, from the Japanese tea-girl to the Pennsylvania coalminer, share a common ancestor in Africa about 150,000 years ago. Dr Stock says scientific techniques to investigate the genetic and chemical makeup of bones are starting to reveal vast new bodies of information. He fears much of the evidence could be soon buried.
"I think it would be catastrophic", Dr Stock said. "With all the factors that influence bone tissue, right now we can only interpret a small fraction of the potential. "If it were a book, we could only read the introduction - so we have a general idea of the information and what's coming ahead but we don't know the details and only developments in technology and improvements in our ability to interpret them will help that."
Much of the material in Cambridge - as elsewhere in the UK - was collected by 19th Century explorers, at a time when scientific inquiry was highly valued. A number of scientists fear some of the changes that may be coming. They worry that emotional and spiritual interests may take priority over rational inquiry.

Time called on boozing?
In a culture where binge drinking is widely tolerated, the temperance movement is trying to stage something of a comeback. But is abstinence a message we want to hear?
Could you swear off the booze - and stick with it?
Sugar and spiked: That's what alcopops are made of
It's a pledge the British National Temperance League would like students to consider, instead of succumbing to the lure of cigarettes and alcopops.
The league is keen to win over more under-30s, who at present, account for just a quarter of the 100-odd members. Administrative director Barbara Briggs says: "We need to attract more young people because our membership is getting more elderly and literally dying off. "But it takes time to get them involved, and for them to make a commitment to a drug-free lifestyle."
The younger recruits generally join after volunteering to help out on league events such as camps for under-privileged children and alcohol-free bars at school dances. Signing up means swearing off all types of drugs, cigarettes included.
Booze refuseniks
It's all a far cry from the late 19th Century, when the temperance league was one of the biggest mass movements in the UK's history. Not even Britney says no At the time, about one in 10 people had sworn off alcohol.
The movement was founded in 1832 in Preston - the "Jerusalem of the teetotal movement" - by weaver Joseph Livesey, who railed against the evils of gin dens and beer houses.
"At its height, between 1876 and 1890, the monthly bulletin went to more than 30,000 people, all of whom would have taken the pledge," Mrs Briggs says. "Today, we send it out quarterly to 1,000 people - members, teachers, youth workers - and we think that's good."
Doing it for the kids
The league has already sent more than 25,000 primary schools a free kit outlining the joys of a drink-'n'-drugs-free lifestyle, and a similar pack will go to secondary schools later this year.
The kit went free to 25,000 primary schools
"We redesigned it to fit in with the national curriculum - it's government strategy to get the message across to children early," Mrs Briggs says.
In an attempt to modernise a movement that was at its height more than a century ago, the league has revamped its pledge to allow members to choose how long they want to stay intoxicant-free.
An abstainer may opt for a month, a year, or 40 years, depending on their circumstances.
Drinking age
But surely those promoting abstinence face an uphill battle. Not only do teenagers face peer pressure, the nation as a whole is geared to an "11 o'clock swill" drinking culture.
A nation of drinkers
British teenagers are the master binge drinkers of Europe. According to a recent survey by the Alcohol and Health Research Centre, a quarter of 15 and 16-year-olds admit to getting drunk three or more times a month. And an increasing number of adults are drinking more than the recommended amounts of alcohol. But by far the biggest change is in what we drink, rather than how much. Wine and alcopops are fast supplanting the traditional pint as favoured tipples. All or nothing
So surely an abstinence pledge is a pretty big commitment. Wouldn't it be more realistic to encourage moderation and European drinking habits instead?
Where's that drink taking you?
"We encourage temperance in the sense of not over-doing it - we want young people to be aware of the pitfalls," says Mrs Briggs.
After all, one of Europe's early temperance leagues was a group of Germans in the 16th Century who pledged to limit themselves to just seven glasses of wine a meal. These were the days, of course, when water wasn't necessarily safe to drink. Then there are the recently discovered and much-vaunted health benefits of supping on a glass or two of red wine.
Which just goes to show, temperance may well be in the eye of the beholder.

Royal links to Poland on display
The Queen Mother made numerous visits to people caught up in the war
Buckingham Palace is staging a display of a number of items detailing royal links with Poland for the country's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski.
Among the items is a 1941 letter from the Queen Mother describing a group of Polish soldiers as "very nice".
Mr Kwasniewski begins a three day state visit to the UK on Wednesday, just days after his country joined the European Union along with nine other countries.
Also on display are two 64-year-old dolls presented to the Queen in 1940.
Meeting in 'rabbit hole'
The items that have gone on display for the state visit have been taken from the Royal Collection and the Royal Archives.
The exhibition is intended as a very special personal thing...I think the Queen expects us to do something very special
Lady Jane Roberts, Royal Collection
The Queen Mother's letter was written to her 14-year-old daughter Princess Elizabeth.
She and her husband King George VI had visited the Commander-in-Chief of the
Polish Armed Forces General Sikorski and his soldiers at Barry Links and Carnoustie, north-east Scotland.
After France fell to the Germans in 1940 the exiled Polish government fled to London, where it remained during the World War II.
In a letter dated 7 March, the Queen Mother said: "Yesterday we spent with the Poles. They were very nice and we walked along miles of coast which they are guarding.
"We were asked occasionally to go down what looked like a large rabbit hole
and how we did it I don't know! But we did and came out again very nearly doubled
up."
'Very pale'
The then exiled Polish President Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz gave the 14-year-old Princess Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret the two dolls as Christmas presents. The exhibition will take place at Buckingham Palace
Dressed in Polish national wedding costumes, the male and female wooden carved figures are taller than the average doll - with the groom standing 66cm in height.
Lady Jane Roberts, from the Royal Collection, said: "The exhibition is
intended as a very special personal thing - the letters from the Queen Mother to
the Queen and dolls that were given to her.
"I think the Queen expects us to do something very special."
Other items on display range from Queen Victoria's 1891 journal - in which she describes Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski as "very pale" - to love letters from 1718 cementing links between the Royal Family and Poland.

Man Utd salvage draw at Chelsea
Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink celebrates his bizarre opener
Chelsea 1-1 Manchester United
Andy Cole rescued a point for Manchester United with a goal in his final game before suspension as he struck to cancel out Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's opener for Chelsea.
Cole latched on to a Ryan Giggs through ball and applied a clinical finish in front of the watching England manager Sven Goran Eriksson.
But the Swede would not have been so impressed with another of his England hopefuls, as Paul Scholes' dreadful first-half error gifted Chelsea their opener.
Chelsea started the brighter, Sam Dalla Bonna seeing a long-range shot take a wicked deflection to force a fine save from Raimond Van der Gouw.
Key moments
24 mins: Scholes' dreadful back header is flicked home by Hasselbaink for Chelsea's opener
48 mins: Silvestre denies Hasselbaink his second with a fine tackle
60 mins: Zola's 'goal' is ruled out after Van Der Gouw's mistake
69 mins: Cole levels for United with clinical finish from Beckham pass
80 mins - Unmarked Scholes fluffs a header in front of goal
The Dutch keeper was deputising for Fabien Barthez after the Frenchman picked up a hamstring injury in training.
But there was nothing he could do to prevent Chelsea from taking a deserved, but bizarre, lead on 24 minutes.
Instead, it was Scholes who was left hanging his head in shame.
Scholes was left red-faced as he attempted to head the ball back to his keeper from the edge of a crowded penalty area.
He only succeeded in finding the lurking Hasselbaink, who gratefully flicked a header beyond a helpless Van der Gouw.
David Beckham spins clear of Dennis Wise
Within a minute, Chelsea nearly returned the compliment as French international defender Marcel Desailly played a short back pass towards Carlo Cudicini.
The keeper was alert enough to hack clear as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looked to pounce.
As the match threatened to develop into a series of defensive blunders, another poor back pass, this time by Dalla Bonna, again put his keeper in trouble.
This time, the Italian reacted angrily when Solskjaer's outstretched boot caught the keeper as he dived bravely at the striker's feet.
Having survived a double scare of their own making, Chelsea had two glorious chances to put the game out of United's reach early in the second half.
I thought we were the better team and the main thrust came from Manchester United
United boss Sir Alex Ferguson Three minutes after the restart, the impressive Gronkjaer, having switched from left flank to right, embarked on a defiant run and fed Hasselbaink with just Van der Gouw to beat.
The striker chose not to shoot first time and instead dragged the ball back to open up the target, only to be denied by a stunning goal-saving tackle by Silvestre.
Then, on the hour, United appeared to have gifted Chelsea a goal for the second time in the match.
Van der Gouw made a suicidal journey outside his penalty area to try to shadow the ball out of play as Zola pressed.
Instead, the Italian won posession then curled a superb shot into United's unguarded net, only for referee David Elleray to rule the ball had gone out of play before Zola made his tackle.
Chelsea came under increasing pressure as the game wore on.
Beckham's dipping free kick was scrambled over the bar by Cudicini, and Giggs saw a rasping drive fly just over.
But Chelsea's resistance finally broke on 69 minutes.
The pitch was quite heavy and bobbly, which stopped both teams playing as well as they can
Chelsea's John Terry Giggs spun into space and played a superb ball behind the Chelsea defence for Cole to latch on to, the England striker just getting ahead of Desailly to beat Cudicini with a clinical finish.
Ten minutes from time, United had a glorious chance to snatch victory as Scholes was presented with the opportunity to make up for his earlier error.
Gary Neville's deep cross from the right was tailor-made for Scholes as he jumped clear of his marker.
But Scholes compounded his earlier error as he completely missed in front of goal.
Chelsea: Cudicini, Babayaro, Leboeuf, Desailly, Terry, Ferrer,
Wise, Dalla Bona, Gronkjaer, Hasselbaink, Zola. Subs: De Goey,
Jokanovic, Stanic, Lambourde, Gudjohnsen.
