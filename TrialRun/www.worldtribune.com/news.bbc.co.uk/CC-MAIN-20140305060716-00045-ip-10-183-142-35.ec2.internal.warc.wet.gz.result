Legal costs hit Microsoft profits
Microsoft's legal travails have been highly complex
Giant software firm Microsoft's profits have been hurt by the cost of settling a raft of law suits over patents and anti-trust allegations. Microsoft's profits dropped 38% to $1.32bn (�744m) for its third quarter to 31 March, compared with the same period a year earlier.
Legal settlements meant a charge of $2.5bn against its pre-tax profits. But sales rose by a healthy 17% to $9.18bn. Technology sector analysts were delighted at the overall picture. Ongoing
Microsoft is battling the European Union over a $600m fine, a record in an EU anti-trust case. However, it recently agreed settlements in several patent cases. It paid $1.6bn to end a patents dispute with Sun Microsystems, and $440m to Californian firm InterTrustend in another patent case. It also settled a class-action anti-trust lawsuit bought against it by customers in Minnesota, whose lawyers were seeking a payout of up to $505m. Payout
Investors are now keen for Microsoft to outline what it plans to do with its massive cash pile and are pushing for an increase in the company's dividend payment. Microsoft just keeps on growing
Chief financial officer John Connors said that he would outline the company's plans later this year. "Investors can certainly expect to hear more on that at the analyst meeting in July," he said. "I think we have made good progress on a number of legal fronts." As well as the settlements, analysts said they were particularly impressed with sales of personal computers and larger servers, two key areas of growth. Server sales increased by 17% in the third quarter, while PCs rose by 14%. "Growth has been phenomenal," said Clark Chang, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. Game on
Another area that is doing well is Microsoft's video-game console, the X-Box. The company has had to cut prices to compete with rivals such as Sony's Playstation, but the strategy seems to be paying off. X-Box sales surged by 30%, though the discounting has had an effect on the product's profitability. Microsoft did, however, add a word of caution. Mr Connors warned that it might prove difficult for the company to keep growing at the frenetic pace seen in previous quarters. E-mail this to a friend

The Archers airs 15,000th episode
June Spencer as Peggy Archer and Denis Folwell as Jack from 1951
The Archers has aired its 15,000th episode with the climax to a plotline that has outraged some of the BBC Radio 4 drama's devoted audience.
Many listeners will have been relieved to hear that Ruth Archer decided not to cheat on her husband, David.
The controversial storyline has had millions waiting to find out if Ruth would consummate her relationship with Sam the herdsman.
The show is believed to be the longest running soap opera in the world.
Night of passion
The Ruth Archer adultery plotline prompted many fans to complain to Radio 4. One listener wrote to Radio 4's website, saying: "I thought The Archers was supposed to be a radio series with an agricultural theme, not an audio version of a Jackie Collins novel."
In the anniversary episode, Ruth headed off to Oxford for a night of passion with Sam in a hotel room. But at the very last minute she decided not to go through with it.
People feel they own a part of the series
Actress Hedli Niklaus
Hedli Niklaus, who plays Kathy Perks, said: "It's hard to be all things to all people, to keep established listeners happy and attract new ones.
"I think that people caring about the characters is a good thing, but so is having their comfort zones challenged once in a while."
She added: "People feel they own a part of the series. We always say there are nearly 5m listeners and there are 5m versions of Ambridge out there."
And editor Vanessa Whitburn told Radio 4's PM programme The Archers was about far more than controversial storylines. "What people love about the programme, I think, is that as well as these strong slightly racier stories there's a real sense of the passing seasons, there's a real charm and actually funnily enough the things that grab listeners sometimes are the quieter stories," she said. The show was first broadcast in the Midlands on Whit Weekend in 1950 and went national a year later. It was originally aimed at a farming audience but despite widening its appeal it still has an agricultural story editor.

Greek unrest takes worrying turn
By Malcolm Brabant
BBC News, Athens
Policemen said they had feared such an attack
Greece's worst civil unrest in more than 30 years has taken its most dangerous turn yet.
A domestic militant group called Revolutionary Struggle has now entered the fray.
The proof, according to Greek officials, comes in the form of bullets fired during an attack on a riot police unit guarding the culture ministry in central Athens on Monday.
Ballistics tests revealed that one of the bullets came from the same weapon used in an attack on an Athens police station in April 2007.
Revolutionary Struggle, described as "a radical leftist group" in a recent US state department report on terrorism, said it had carried out that attack.
Previously, the group also claimed a rocket attack on the US embassy in Athens the same year.
A 21-year-old member of the riot police unit, Diamandis Mantzounis, is in a critical condition after the attack. He was shot in the body and leg - though the bullets that struck him were fired from a second weapon.
Greece's national police chief, Lt Gen Vassilis Tsiatouras, said that was a Kalashnikov, that tests showed was also used in an attack last month on a bus carrying 22 riot police.
However, the general attempted to play down a resurgence of domestic terrorism.
He said he thought the attacks were the work of a group of people who had "lost their senses" following the death of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos on 6 December 2008.
The shooting, by a 37-year-old policeman, triggered weeks of riots across the country.
History of terror
Monday's developments are regarded as highly significant by anti-terrorist specialists at the US embassy in Athens, who are analysing the "format, the fashion, and the weapons" used in the attack.
An impromptu public memorial has been set up for Alexis Grigoropoulos
The embassy is still offering a $1m (�690,000) reward for information leading to the successful prosecution of the Revolutionary Struggle operatives, who fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the building in January 2007.
The state department said it believed the Revolutionary Struggle was also responsible for "nine violent terrorist attacks since 2003, including the 2004 murder of a Greek guard outside the British defence attache's residence".
It said that in 2006, the group claimed responsibility for triggering a remote-controlled explosive device targeting the Greek culture minister.
The big question troubling Greece is whether there is going to be a revival of domestic terrorism along the lines of November 17 (N17), another "populist" left-wing anti-capitalist group, responsible for two dozen assassinations and scores of bomb attacks during a three-decade campaign.
The Greek authorities disbanded N17 after Savvas Xeros, a painter and son of an Orthodox priest, was caught in 2002 when the bomb he was planting exploded prematurely.
The involvement of British detectives, following N17's murder of the UK's defence attache, Stephen Saunders, in 2000, also helped the Greek police bring the case to trial.
Fifteen members of N17 were given lengthy jail sentences.
Flash in the pan?
The US state department says the Revolutionary Struggle has "aligned itself with the ideology of N17" and may have incorporated some of its former members.
However, Brady Kiesling, a former US embassy diplomat in Athens told the BBC: "Revolutionary Struggle are people inspired by N17, but the organisation is not a successor except vaguely psychologically.
The death of Alexis Grigoropoulos triggered riots across Greece
"What you have are spontaneous, arbitrary attacks. When there is a political window, they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that N17 used."
He said: "They are dangerous, but not nearly as dangerous as N17 were.
"N17 was massively security conscious. They lived off the land. They never indebted themselves to anybody. It sounds as though Revolutionary Struggle is buying from the illegal arms market, such as the Albanian dealers. N17 would never do that."
Mr Kiesling said advances in DNA analysis, security surveillance and mobile phone analysis made it much harder to do what N17 used to.
"My gut tells me this is a flash in the pan," said Mr Kiesling, who is writing a book about N17.
"Most of the far-left groups out there prefer a live-and-let-live approach with the police. This kind of shooting destabilises the status quo. There will not be a lot of social support for the shooting."
That will not come as much relief to the average policeman on the street, who has become a hate figure for much of the population.
'Defensive posture'
Last month, a young police officer called Jimmy contacted me because he was weary of the Greek media demonising the force, and wanted to "put the record straight".
"Not every Greek policeman is a batsos!" Jimmy implored.
"Batsos" forms the first word of the derogatory chant directed at the police at every opportunity by Greek demonstrators.
The media interprets the phrase as "cops, pigs, murderers".
But batsos is much more derogatory than just "cop". The word comes from the verb to slap and, to use a euphemistic translation, it means "uniformed thug".
The insult was particularly popular from 1967-1974, when Greece was ruled by a harsh military junta, and police violence was commonplace.
Jimmy says he and his colleagues have been advised not to wear their uniforms when travelling to and from work.
"We are afraid that one of us will be murdered soon," he says.
As Monday's shooting outside the culture ministry proved, the young officer's fears had a solid foundation.
"I don't believe this hatred of the police is justified. I always try not to use violence and use respect when I arrest someone," Jimmy said.
"But at the moment, my colleagues and I are tired of adopting a defensive posture."
The latest shooting may change all that.
Says Brady Kiesling: "This licenses police to arrest people again. They are angry enough to take more risks."

Maths ability linked to grey matter
Brain scans were taken to examine anatomical abnormalities
Scientists believe they have isolated the part of the brain that determines how good children are at maths.
Researchers at the Institute of Child Health at Great Ormond Street
Hospital, London, found that children who were bad at calculation had a reduced amount of grey matter on the left hand side of their brains.
Grey matter is the name given to areas of the brain that are mainly composed of the heads of nerve cells.
Researchers studied 80 children who had been born prematurely.
They used brain scan images to examine anatomical abnormalities on the left parietal lobe in the
children.
'Fruitful research'
It revealed the difference in grey matter between children who were good and bad at calculation.
Dr Elizabeth Isaacs, who led the study, said the research did not mean that all
children with calculation problems would have the same parietal lobe anomaly.
"Imaging studies will be needed for a broader range of children," she said. However, since the area identified has also been implicated in adult studies, it seems a
fruitful area for further research.
"Diagnosis in individual children and perhaps remedial methods are an
interesting area of speculation."
The results were published in the journal Brain.

Company's plans for town rejected
A new town square was planned for the heart of the development
A proposal by Sainsbury's that was designed to allow a Cumbrian town's stalled development scheme move forward has been rejected.
Penrith's New Squares redevelopment came to a halt last Autumn when the backer, an Australian bank, pulled out, blaming the credit crunch. Following a debate on Thursday night, councillors decided not to accept Sainsbury's plan. However, the council was told to hold further discussions with all partners. Councillor Colin Nineham, leader of Eden District Council, said: "There has been a lot of hard work put in by various partners to bring the proposal forward but members felt that it did not meet what the council wanted to achieve. "Even in these difficult times, it is vital we get the right outcome for the town that enables us to attract visitors and meet the needs of residents."

Plastic bag-free town on target
Selkirk is on course to be plastic bag free by the end of March
A campaign to make a Borders town plastic bag-free aims to achieve its goal within six weeks.
The initiative in Selkirk would involve residents being issued with replacement canvas-type bags by 31 March.
The project has been backed by traders and funding from Scottish Borders Council's community grants scheme.
It has attracted interest across the region, with Peebles, Innerleithen, West Linton, Broughton and Melrose also considering the move.
Jenna Agate, spokeswoman for Selkirk Plastic Bag Free, said the project was progressing well.
'Gentleman's agreement'
"We are optimistic that we shall meet our deadline of no more plastic bags in the town by 31 March," she said.
"A lot of the traders are considering changing to paper and others will use compostable cornstarch bags instead of plastic.
"We are currently working on a gentleman's agreement that we shall ask traders to sign, whereby they will agree not to issue, give out or sell any plastic bags to any customer after this date."
In May 2007 every shop in the Devon town of Modbury banned plastic bags at the suggestion of a local resident.
Since then, a number of towns across the UK have announced plans to follow suit.

Teen Robson to play at Wimbledon
British tennis teen Laura Robson is set to become the youngest player to compete at Wimbledon since 1995.The 15-year-old won the junior title at Wimbledon in 2008, but 12 months on will take on the biggest names in women's tennis in the main draw. Robson has been given a wildcard to take part, as her world ranking isn't high enough to earn her a spot yet. But Wimbledon bosses have decided that Robson is such a good player that she should be given a chance. Try our Andy Murray quiz
The last player to play at Wimbledon aged 15 was former world number one Martina Hingis. British number one players Andy Murray and Anne Keothavong
Tournament organisers keep a few spots spare to give to special players as wildcards. Four other British women - Elena Baltacha, Katie O'Brien, Melanie South and Georgie Stoop - have also got wildcards, as have four British men - Alex Bogdanovic, Daniel Evans, Josh Goodall and James Ward. Andy Murray and Anne Keothavong have both earned spots at Wimbledon because of their world rankings.

Tuesday's football photos
Stoke City 3-2 Birmingham City: Tony Pulis may have every right to question referees' decisions this season but his side are on a losing streak of five games, and have lost five of their last 11 at home
City may have won three of their last four games at Stoke but, with their forwards finding struggling for form in the league, must look to the likes of Craig Gardner or Liam Ridgwell for goals
The Blues have most of the ball early on but keep playing it over the top to Cameron Jerome to no effect while Stoke go close through Kenwyne Jones with their first attack
With Ryan Shawcross suspended, Stoke start with Abdoulaye Faye and Danny Higginbotham at the back and the latter is thwarted by Ben Foster as the hosts continue to press, Ricardo Fuller unlucky not to pick up the scraps
The hosts have Jones and Fuller up-front, Robert Huth available at set pieces and crossers like Jermaine Pennant and Matthew Etherington, and so continue to press and pepper the Blues' box with high crosses
Pulis's men take the lead from a set piece, the ball breaking to Fuller, whose blocked shot ricochets to Huth nearly on the penalty spot to fire past Foster, otherwise keeping Birmingham in the game on his own
Huth misses two more chances from corners either side of half time, one header cleared off the line, one sent wide, but Fuller doubles Stoke's lead, turning his man before scoring a peach with his left foot
The visitors boss possession for the first time in the game and when Stoke don't deal with a right-wing cross, the ball drops for substitute Keith Fahey who traps the ball on his chest and fires the ball home
The home side look nervous and soon enough Jerome heads in Stephen Carr's cross, again from the right, to draw the Blues back to 2-2 for the second time in four days
As well as the two goals, Birmingham bring a trio of saves from Asmir Begovic but the Potters, as against Villa in Septembe, show their mettle when Dean Whitehead squeezes the ball past Foster to win the game
Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Sunderland: Spurs fans will wonder which side Harry Redknapp will put out - the one that saw off Inter Milan with bravado or the one that surrendered to Bolton Wanderers?
With ex-Spur and top-scorer Darren Bent out of action, Sunderland's Asamoah Gyan has proven the perfect tonic for Steve Bruce following his team's recent derby drubbing
Bruce's side have lost their last 10 games in London but welcome back Craig Gordon in goal and the Scottish international makes a good early save from Luka Modric's scuffed shot
Rafael van der Vaart is back and David Bentley gets a first league start; Spurs look more positive and Roman Pavlyuchenko goes close with a 30-yard run and shot before captain Tom Huddlestone hits the bar
After 65 minutes of pressure, Tottenham break the Sunderland defence as Gareth Bale puts a high ball to the back cross that Gordon misses, Peter Crouch knocks it down and Van der Vaart scores inside the six-yard box
But only two minutes later Sunderland draw level as William Gallas and Younes Kaboul get in a tangle of equal comedy and tragedy, laying on a simple equaliser for Gyan
Spurs are playing under a cloud of expectation cast by their Champions League performance, the match turns nasty, briefly, following Lee Cattermole's tackle on Modric and the home side are booed from the pitch
