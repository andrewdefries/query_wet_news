US military wages war on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
Many US veterans have been mentally scarred by recent conflicts
After long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, many US soldiers are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, prompting the US military to develop ways to help them, the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington reports.Twelve soldiers sit on the floor, with eyes closed, focussing on their sacral chakra. They chant in unison. An audience listens attentively to the words of a Greek tragedy, written 2,500 years ago. And a young man, mentally scarred, trains a dog to open doors for an injured colleague. These are surprising scenes from the US military's 21st Century war on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We're looking at skyrocketing suicide rates, and we recently hit the 30-year high
Tim Embree, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America
It's been more than eight years since the US went to war in Afghanistan, and more than seven since it invaded Iraq. In that time, almost two million American men and women have been sent to one or other battlefield. Many have been sent to both. It's hard to know precisely how many have already suffered PTSD, or will do as a result of their traumatic experiences, but experts believe the number is high. Family distressDr Charles Engel, director of the Pentagon's Deployment Health Clinical Center based at the Walter Reed military hospital in Washington, extrapolates on the basis of past experience. The Theatre of War programme has a huge healing effect, medics say
"What we usually think of in terms of PTSD are numbers of the order of 10-15% of people who've been deployed to theatre being affected," he says. That would be 200,000-300,000 people. "I think it's safe to say we haven't grappled with it since Vietnam," says Dr Engel. Recent surveys have all shown that PTSD is taking its toll on military men and women and their families, with symptoms including depression, substance abuse, domestic violence. "We're looking at skyrocketing suicide rates," says Tim Embree, of the campaigning group, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, "and we recently hit the 30-year high." Ancient experiencesFaced with the sort of challenge it hasn't encountered for a couple of generations, the military is responding. Reaching out through ad campaigns, shifting the emphasis in training and exploring dozens of methods of treatment, some well established, others more experimental.
A MEDIC'S STORY
Eventually no matter who you are, war will affect you. War will change your soul
William B AllenMedic
In his own words: William B Allen
At Walter Reed, a soldier, who prefers not to give his name, tells how training a dog to open doors and flick switches for physically impaired servicemen is helping him to deal with his own PTSD. "Emotionally, it helps me out tremendously," he says, "so I don't feel isolated in a room." And when a group of actors shows up at Walter Reed to perform a programme called Theatre of War, reciting harrowing scenes from two Sophocles plays, Ajax and Philoctetes, which deal with the mental and physical scars of war, the response among patients and military physicians alike is astonishing. "One of the things that really struck me was how Tecmessa pleaded with Ajax, and Ajax's mind was already made," says Maj Jeff Hall, who came close to committing suicide after he returned from Iraq. "That was me. That was us." After presenting his performances to military audiences across the country for a couple of years, translator and director Bryan Doerries says the therapeutic value of using these plays, written by a general, is obvious. "It is the ancient description of what we now call PTSD," he says. "What we see time and time again is audiences... all of a sudden seeing themselves as not alone, and then opening up in ways I don't think would happen otherwise." 'Spiritual fitness'Across the country, individual bases are conducting their own programmes. At the largest of all, Fort Hood, in Texas, 12 soldiers graduate every three weeks from the Warrior Combat Stress Reset Programme, part of an approach which includes meditation, acupuncture, reiki and sound therapy. More traditional treatment is also used by US doctors
With a Resiliency Campus that features a Spiritual Fitness Centre and a reflective pond, it all sounds rather New Age, but the men and women who run it - and the soldiers who come looking for help - are sure that it is making a difference. "This is not a soft programme," says clinical psychologist Dr Jerry Wesch. "People come here and do really deep, hard work." "After three weeks here, I learned tools," says Irwing Aguilera, a combat medic with two years experience in Iraq. "I can one day be how I used to be before I experienced chaos and death." With the help of the Rand Corporation, the Pentagon is now looking at about 1,300 programmes being offered at bases to see what works and what should be made more widely available. The one thing that soldiers who have experienced the treatments say over and over again is that they help, but it's not enough. The army's Assistant Surgeon General, Brig Gen Richard Thomas, agrees. "We are doing better. We are not winning yet," he says. "I think it's going to take us three to five years to really change the culture with respect to these injuries. We're in this war for a long time." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Rap's stormy Knight
Knight thrived in Los Angeles' violent gang struggles
Marion "Suge" Knight's release will see the return of one of hip-hop's most notorious and feared figures.
It will also revive memories of the hip-hop battles of the mid-1990s, which saw two of its biggest stars - Tupac Shakur and the Notorious BIG murdered.
Knight, 35, whose Death Row Records label was one of rap's leading imprints, has been serving a nine-year term since October 1996 for a probation violation.
Knight was born in 1966 in Compton, one of Los Angeles' roughest districts. His nickname comes from "sugar bear".
He attended the University of Nevada in Las Vegas and tried out for the LA Rams gridiron team before gravitating towards the record industry.
Bodyguard
He started out as a bodyguard - he weighs around 23 stones - to performers such as Bobby Brown, before starting his own label in 1989.
Tupac was signed after Knight posted $1.4m bail
From its early days, Death Row Recordings was accused of using violence to serve its own ends.
The rise of the company was played out against the continuing gang warfare which had riddled Compton for many years.
A lawsuit filed against Knight and rapper Dr Dre claimed he brought along bats and pipes to help persuade Ruthless Records boss Eric Wright - otherwise known as NWA rapper Easy-E - to release Dre from his contract. Easy-E - who formed NWA alongside Ice Cube and Dr Dre in 1987 - had ties with the Crips gang from the south of Compton, while Knight was linked to the Bloods, based in the north.
Dre was released from his contract and the Knight-produced album The Chronic sold five million copies after it was released in 1992.
Assault
While the case was settled out of court, allegations about Knight's business practices continued. In 1995, he was convicted of assaulting two rappers who he caught using a telephone in a studio without his permission, and was put on probation.
The same year, rapper Tupac Shakur was convicted of sexually assaulting a female fan. Knight put up $1.4m bail to ensure Tupac's release - and his presence on Death Row.
Knight's empire: Death Row Records Tupac became Death Row's biggest artist - but he was also a magnet for trouble. He was shot and robbed in 1994 - and Tupac alleged New York entrepreneur Sean "Puffy" Combs and his Bad Boy Entertainment label were involved. Combs denied it - but an east coast-west coast feud was born.
Knight attacked Combs - now himself a multi-million selling rapper as Puff Daddy - for appearing in his artists' videos, while Bad Boy artists renamed Tupac "One-pac" because he had lost a testicle in the 1994 shooting.
Bodyguards from the two camps were also caught brawling.
Tupac murder
In September 1996, Tupac and Knight had attended a Mike Tyson fight in Las Vegas when Tupac confronted a young man in the lobby of the MGM Grand Hotel - reportedly accusing him of being a Crip.
Security cameras caught Tupac punching the man, Orlando Anderson, while Knight and the rest of his entourage kicked him in the head and body before leaving.
A few hours later, Tupac was shot by a gunman who pulled alongside the car carrying him and Knight through Las Vegas. He died a few days later.
Anderson, who was himself murdered in 1998, was a suspect, but his family have always maintained his innocence.
Jailed
In November 1996, a Los Angeles judge found Knight guilty of breaking his probation by taking part in the assault on Anderson. The Death Row empire was about to crash down around him, as he was sentenced to nine years in jail.
"Mr Knight, you blew it," Superior Court Judge J Stephen Czuleger told him in February 1997.
"In the interest of public safety I cannot put you back on probation."
Knight was involved in a feud with Sean "Puffy" Combs Shortly after Knight was sentenced, the east-west coast war looked set to intensify after a second killing - that of Notorious BIG, a Bad Boy artist whose real name was Christopher Wallace.
However, tempers cooled, although police did raid Death Row Records' offices two years later. As in the case of Tupac's killing, no charges have been brought regarding Wallace's death.
Release
Since Knight's incarceration, his old rival Sean "Puffy" Combs has become a household name around the world.
Meanwhile, Death Row has fallen from its once-dominant position, with posthumous Tupac Shakur albums boosting its income. Acts such as Dr Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and Nate Dogg have left the label.
Many people in the industry are dreading Knight's release - others will be pleased to have his talent-spotting skills back. His publicist Jonathan Wolfson said he is keen to return to the fray.
"Death Row Records has been behind bars for the last four-plus years," he said.
But fresh trouble could still be in store. After five years, a federal grand jury is still investigating Death Row's affairs amid allegations of drug trafficking and money laundering.
Whatever happens, 2001 looks like being a very interesting year for hip-hop fans.

The heatwave is set to continue for many parts
The Met Office has raised its heatwave alert level in parts of England, as hot and humid conditions look set to continue until Friday.London and the South East are now on Level 3 of four, with temperatures set to reach at least 32C (89.6F). The Department of Health has issued special advice for the elderly and other people at risk from the heat. Other areas are cooler and heavy rain is moving into Scotland, Wales, and south-west and northern England. Thunderstorms in Tyne and Wear and Cumbria caused flash floods on Wednesday, with up to 500 lightning strikes recorded across the region in just a few hours. The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings of heavy rain for the Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, northern England and south-west Scotland and the Borders. Wet weather is also forecast in Wales and south-western England on Thursday.
HEATWAVE ADVICE
Keep curtains on windows exposed to the sun closed if the temperature outside is higher than it is inside.
Once the temperature outside has dropped lower than it is inside, open the windows
Water plants, and spray the ground outside windows with water to help cool the air
Those at risk should stay out of the sun, especially between the hours of 11am and 3pm

It is the first time the Met Office has issued a Level 3 heatwave alert since June 2006. It occurs when temperatures reach a certain threshold - which vary by region - and are sustained in one or more regions over two nights and the intervening day, with a forecast of higher temperatures to come. The Met Office said a key factor in raising the alert had been night-time temperatures, with some areas not falling below 18C. The highest heatwave level - Level 4 - is classed as "red emergency". It is reached when heat is so severe that illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, and not just in high-risk groups. Met Office spokeswoman Sarah Holland said: "We are expecting temperatures in London and the South East to reach 31-32C today and on Thursday they might reach 33C. "After that we are expecting temperatures to come down and by the weekend it should be a lot cooler." On Tuesday, the government's health advice line NHS Direct took a total of 318 calls from members of the public complaining about sunburn, heat-exhaustion, breathing difficulties and other heat-related ailments. The Department of Health (DoH) said those at most risk from heatstroke included the very young and the very old, and people with heart and respiratory problems.

It said people should contact their local environmental health officer if they had concerns about living conditions for themselves or a vulnerable friend, neighbour or relative. People with respiratory problems should stay inside during the hottest part of the day. Anyone with symptoms of heat exhaustion should drink plenty of water and move somewhere cool. Those with symptoms of heatstroke should be moved somewhere cooler and sponged with water while urgent medical treatment is sought. London Underground passengers are being advised to take bottles of water on every Tube journey. And St John's Ambulance volunteers are on hand to issue advice and treat tennis fans suffering from the heat at Wimbledon. The Met Office says by Friday the heatwave should start to dissipate, with temperatures heading back to normal levels over the weekend.

'Scottish Six' back on the agenda
The possibility of the BBC broadcasting a Scottish Six O' clock television news, which would be entirely produced in Scotland, will be considered next year.
The wrangle was raised while members of the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster heard evidence from senior BBC Scotland executives.
Sir Robert Smith, the BBC's national governor, said the Broadcasting Council for Scotland wanted editorial control for such a programme to be held in Scotland.
The call for a "Scottish Six" increased after the BBC decided in December 1998 to that Scotland should continue to receive the Six O'Clock news from London, followed by a half-hour programme from Glasgow.
Sir Robert told MPs on the committee that the issue would be revisited after the next Scottish Parliament elections in May 2003.
Part of the new building at Pacific Quay
He said the broadcasting council "would not lack courage" in arguing for the programme if, after reconsidering the situation, it was judged to be the best option.
The committee also questioned BBC Scotland controller John McCormick; head of news and current affairs Blair Jenkins and head of network television news Roger Mosey.
BBC Scotland's planned move to a �30m custom-built centre at Pacific Quay on the River Clyde in Glasgow, is now set for 2005, MPs heard.
The 60-acre site is currently undergoing a major transformation to include the Glasgow Science Centre, Imax Cinema, the Millennium Tower and Pacific Quay Developments' business park.
Mr McCormick said among other enhancements to the BBC's output in Scotland, 50 people were now employed working on online content.
Broadcasting is a "reserved" area, meaning it falls within the remit of Westminster and is not devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Moving image pioneer Louis Le Prince remembered
Louis Le Prince - image courtesy of The Photographic Journal
You may not be aware but the godfather of the moving image lived and worked in Leeds.Or the claim that he was the victim of industrial espionage and was possibly even murdered because of his work. Louis Le Prince recorded the first moving images in Leeds at Roundhay Park and on Leeds Bridge in 1888. An English Heritage blue plaque can be found on the bridge honouring the historic moment. Louis Le Prince was born in Metz, France on 28 August 1842 and moved to Leeds in 1866 to work for John Whitley Partners of Hunslet Brass Founders. In 1869 he married Elizabeth Whitley John's sister - a talented artist. The pair founded Leeds Technical School of Art. Le Prince's revolutionary 16 lens camera
Louis Le Prince created his 16 lens camera, which was used to record the world's first moving images, at 160 Woodhouse Lane (a site now owned by the University of Leeds). His first film was created in 1888 called "Roundhay Garden Scene" and his second and more famous "Leeds Bridge Scene" came in the same year. Just two years after making his revolutionary recordings, Le Prince mysteriously vanished after boarding a train in Dijon, France. His body and luggage were never found and the case remained unsolved. Now a new exhibition at Leeds Industrial Museum will commemorate 120 years since his unexplained disappearance by celebrating the genius and legacy of Leeds' adopted son by holding a series of events. Visitors will have a chance to see how a replica of his revolutionary camera worked, watch the world's first moving images in the mills' cinema and learn about his disappearance. A still image from Le Prince's film of Leeds Bridge
A workshop will look at the key theories surrounding Le Prince's disappearance and help visitors decide which one is most likely to be true. Children will get the chance to do some detective activities like code breaking and finger printing. Several theories explaining Le Prince's disappearance have been proposed including claims he was murdered so he could not claim patents on his groundbreaking 16 lens camera, a close relative was involved in his disappearance to gain a large inheritance and his family ordered him to disappear due to financial irregularities. The events take place at Leeds Industrial Museum, Armley Mills, Canal Road in Armley from Tuesday 17 August to Thursday 19 August 2010. details of all the events and workshops can be found on the museum's website.
