Vodafone shares hit two-year low
Share price headache for Vodafone boss Chris Gent
Shares in Vodafone, the UK's biggest company, have slipped to their lowest level in nearly two years amid continuing gloom over the telecoms sector. The latest share price fall reflected growing investor unease about heavily-indebted telecoms firms as a whole rather than any bad news affecting Vodafone alone. But it is a blow to many of the UK's small investors. Vodafone and British Telecom together knocked 34 points off the FTSE 100 index on Friday, pushing down the value of funds investing in the UK's leading companies. The mobile phone group's shares closed at 216.25 pence, 9.75p or 4.3% down on the day and almost half their peak of about 400p hit last March. Friday's close was the issue's lowest level since April 1999. More potent
In other circumstances, investors might have been cheered by the news - emerging on Thursday - that Vodafone had made an indicative offer for Optus, Australia's number two wireless operator, potentially deepening its worldwide presence. But more potent was the combination of factors that has led many European telecoms firms to lose half their market value over the past year. These range from expensive new operating licences, high debts and slowing revenues to safety issues and the general gloom overshadowing the technology sector and the powerhouse US economy.
Although many firms reported strong profit and revenue growth during 2000, investors have taken fright at much more cautious forecasts for 2001. Half-price Nokia
In the UK this week, BT has struggled to convince investors that its debt reduction plans are feasible while France Telecom was forced to slash its flotation price for Orange after seeing weak demand for the shares. BT shares lost another 4% on Friday following the previous day's 9% drop, ending at 595p, while France Telecom dipped 1.25% in Paris. Other European telecoms issues also suffered. Finland's Nokia - the world's biggest mobile phone maker - slid more than 9% to close at a 15-month low. The shares have now lost more than half of their value in about six months. Friday's losses wiped $14bn off the company's market value. Sweden's Ericsson, Germany's Siemens and Philips of the Netherlands were also substantially lower. Trading in Orange shares is due to begin in London and Paris next Tuesday. Search BBC News Online

Orange coalition to lead Ukraine
The last "Orange" government fell apart after seven months
Ukraine's pro-Western "Orange" parties have agreed after months of uncertainty to form a coalition - the first step towards a new government.
The coalition of parties led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko - both leaders of the 2004 Orange Revolution - has a majority of just one seat.
Ms Tymoshenko is expected to become prime minister in the new government.
Elections in September gave the two parties enough combined votes to defeat current PM Viktor Yanukovych's party.
His Party of Regions, which has its base in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east, won the largest single share of votes in the election but is now expected to be the main opposition group.
Orange feud
The two Orange bloc parties reached a loose agreement in October to form a coalition.
But disagreements remained over which government posts each party would control.
Thursday's deal makes it likely that Ms Tymoshenko will again become prime minister - an office she occupied briefly in 2005 before being sacked by the then president, Viktor Yushchenko.
Mr Yushchenko's party is expected to have the right to choose the parliamentary speaker - a powerful office in Ukraine.
Wrangling between the erstwhile allies, Ms Tymoshenko and Mr Yushchenko, has recently dominated Ukrainian politics.
Mr Yushchenko became president after street protests in 2004, dubbed the "Orange Revolution". He defeated his bitter rival, Mr Yanukovych, whose election had been widely condemned as fraudulent.

PC rage hits UK
Computers increasingly commonplace in offices
As the reliance on computers in the workplace continues to grow, people in the UK are resorting to violence when their PCs break down, say researchers.
When faced with technical problems, most people shouted at colleagues, hit the PC or even threw parts of the computers.
The most frustrating hitch was when people lost their work after their computer crashed or froze.
The problems seem to be widespread with more than a quarter of those working with computers experience problems
with their PC on a weekly basis.
PC problems can affect anyone
"Over half of all working days lost to sickness in the UK are related to workplace stress," said Fiona Dennis, a stress management trainer with Priory Healthcare.
"Being heavily reliant on IT to speed up our lives means that performance is hampered greatly when it fails, causing an over-reaction and stress."
70% swear at PCs
The study by the National Opinion Poll and the software company Symantec, found that nearly half of all computer users had become angry at some time.
Almost a third of people had physically attacked a computer, 67% experienced frustration, exasperation and anger and more than 70% swore at their machines.
Technology rage is the latest rage to emerge in Britain and follows road rage, trolley rage and air rage.
There was a dramatic rise in air rage incidents last year, with 174 people detained at Heathrow and Gatwick alone. In 1998 the number of air rage arrests for the whole country was 98.

Cyclists bare all in oil protest
Worldwide protests
More than 100 cyclists have ridden around London naked in a mass protest against dependency on the oil industry.
Protesters on The World Naked Bike Ride cycled past Piccadilly Circus, Big Ben, Covent Garden, Oxford Street and the US Embassy on the 10km route. Riders in 54 cities were protesting at the "destructive effects of car culture" and celebrating "the power and individuality of their bodies".
The ride ended at the Serpentine in Hyde Park.
Rider Melissa Evans, 32, said: "This shows how serious we are in opposing oil dependency.
"Like many people, I'm afraid of showing my body in public, but I'm more afraid of relying on environmentally-destructive fuels."
The event is part of London Sustainability Week 2005 and National Bike Week 2005.

Claim over Bloody Sunday's 'first shot'
Thirteen civilians were killed on Bloody Sunday
The Saville inquiry had heard more details about the claim that Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness fired the first shot on Bloody Sunday.
According to a security service document shown to
the inquiry on Tuesday, Martin McGuinness "seemed to have it on his conscience that he fired the
first shot" on 30 January 1972.
The inquiry was ordered by Prime Minister Tony Blair to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shooting dead of 13 civilians taking part in a civil rights march in Londonderry in 1972. A fourteenth person died later from his wounds. The claim was contained in a service officer's written account of a conversation
with an agent known as Infliction - a document shown at the public
hearings in the Guildhall in Derry.
Martin McGuinness: Denied the claim
It said: "He (Mr McGuinness) fired the first shot and nobody knows this. "This seems to be on McGuinness's conscience. He has spoken to Infliction about it
several times."
The material was shown as the Saville Tribunal began considering government
bids to censor security service and Ministry of Defence material - including the
Infliction notes and a tape recording of the debriefing.
A Public Interest Immunity Certificate has been received from the Home Office
alleging that full disclosure of the contents of security service documents
could cause real harm to the work of the service.
Infliction is described in the certificate as an agent resettled outside the
UK. The application covers another informant, Observer B, said by the Home
Office to be a former agent.
Material
The tribunal has already been shown material about the agents' claims - but
with large portions of the documents blanked out.
Material shown in April this year contained a communication about Infliction's
alleged claims dated April 1984.
It states: "Martin McGuinness had admitted to Infliction that he had
personally fired the shot (from a Thompson machine gun on single shot) from the
Rossville flats in Bogside that had precipitated the Bloody Sunday episode."
The other 19 lines on the page have been blacked out.
The Northern Ireland education minister subsequently denied the claims
outside the tribunal.
Observer B is alleged to have witnessed IRA auxiliaries drilling at the
Rossville Flats in the days leading up to Bloody Sunday and to have been told
afterwards that the IRA opened fire first.
He has already been granted anonymity and screening by the Tribunal and when
called to give evidence will be allowed to do so by live video link-up, seen
only by the three tribunal judges and lawyers.
Lawyers for those killed are expected to mount stiff opposition to the
application, which also seeks anonymity and screening for serving and former
security service officers.
The Ministry of Defence has also issued a PIIC covering secret documents.
The inquiry, established in 1998, has been sitting in public in the Guildhall since March this year and began hearing live witness testimonies a week
ago.
To date it has cost in the region of �30m and it is expected to run for
at least two more years.

McLaren lanza ofensiva
Ser�a una tragedia que uno de los mejores campeonatos de F1 de los �ltimos a�os quede a la sombra del comportamiento de un empleado de Ferrari y un empleado de McLaren
Ron Dennis
Adoptando una estrategia m�s conocida en el f�tbol -la mejor defensa es el ataque- la escuder�a McLaren de F�rmula Uno dio un giro a las acusaciones de espionaje que pesan en su contra y calific� de ilegal la victoria de Ferrari en el Gran Premio de Australia.
El patr�n del equipo brit�nico, Ron Dennis, envi� una carta a la Federaci�n Internacional de Automovilismo (FIA) criticando la forma en la que McLaren est� siendo tratado en el caso de espionaje.
"La reputaci�n de McLaren ha sido cuestionada injustamente por informaciones de prensa en Italia y las afirmaciones err�neas del comunicado emitido por Ferrari", reclam� Dennis.
Esta ofensiva se produce un d�a despu�s de que la FIA decidiera apelar la decisi�n de su propio Consejo Mundial de absolver a McLaren, fallo que Ferrari calific� de "il�gico" y de "vergonzoso".
La escuder�a italiana siente que ha sido la v�ctima en la historia, que implica al jefe de dise�o de McLaren, Mike Coughlan, y al ex-director de desarrollo t�cnico de Ferrari, Nigel Stepney.
Coughlan fue suspendido de sus funciones cuando se encontr� en su poder un portafolio de m�s de 700 p�ginas con material secreto de Ferrari, que supuestamente habr�a recibido los documentos de Stepney, quien asegura ser inocente.
Freno a la F1
Dennis considera que la pol�mica ha perjudicado a la F�rmula Uno, que vive una de las mejores temporadas en los �ltimos a�os, con cuatro pilotos en la lucha por el t�tulo.
Si no hubiera sido porque el se�or Stepney advirti� a McLaren, y que McLaren advirti� a la FIA, suponemos que Ferrari hubiera seguido corriendo con un monoplaza ilegal
Ron Dennis
Pero la atenci�n se centra lejos de las pistas y amenaza con empa�ar el desarrollo del campeonato.
En su carta, Dennis elogia la posici�n de Stepney de advertir a Coughlan sobre dos elementos que Ferrari hab�a incorporado en el dise�o de sus autos antes de la prueba en Australia: un separador en el aler�n trasero y un suelo "flexible".
El primero fue homologado por la FIA, pero el segundo sigue siendo ilegal.
Seg�n el director de McLaren, Ferrari gan� el Gran Premio -con Kimi Raikkonen- utilizando ambos dispositivos, eliminando el elemento del suelo despu�s de que la FIA confirmara su ilegalidad.
"Si no hubiera sido porque el se�or Stepney advirti� a McLaren, y que McLaren advirti� a la FIA, suponemos que Ferrari habr�a seguido corriendo con un monoplaza ilegal".
A pesar de agradecer el gesto, Dennis explica en su carta que orden� a Coughlan evitar cualquier tipo de contacto con Stepney, y reitera que ning�n miembro de su empresa tuvo acceso al portafolio, versi�n que contradice la emitida por Ferrari.
"La raz�n por la que McLaren no fue castigada es porque no puede ser culpada del comportamiento del se�or Coughlan".
"Es una decisi�n basada en hechos s�lidos y no suposiciones".
"Ser�a una tragedia que uno de los mejores campeonatos de F1 de los �ltimos a�os quede a la sombra del comportamiento de un empleado de Ferrari y un empleado de McLaren que actuaron de forma personal sin el conocimiento de Ferrari o McLaren".
Este fin de semana se reanuda la temporada con la disputa del Gran Premio de Hungr�a.

Wycombe Wanderers' Jon-Paul Pittman has surgery success
Pittman has scored once in six appearances this season
Wycombe Wanderers forward Jon-Paul Pittman is in good shape, according to a club medic, after undergoing surgery on a ruptured knee tendon.The 23-year-old picked up the injury while warming up ahead of the 2-1 defeat by Macclesfield. The Chairboys' head of medical and sport science Stuart Ayles told the club's website: "The surgeon is very pleased with the results. "I spoke to Jon-Paul earlier and he's a bit sore but that is to be expected." The former Crawley front man will now spend about three weeks in a brace and is expected to be out for at least four months.

Thorpey reveals his fishy tales Around the Academy:
Thorpe: I will swap you all these for some Sashimi
Ian Thorpe
Freestyle swimmer
Aussie swimming sensation Ian Thorpe tells BBC Sport Academy all about his love for Japanese food. When I am training at home I have a very healthy diet. For breakfast I have cereal, toast and fruit juice.
I will usually have jam on my toast and the fruit juice is usually fresh orange.
The rest of my meals in the day consist of low fat foods which are high in carbohydrate with a lot of protein and plenty of vegetables. This gives me the energy to swim as much as I want, especially when I wash it down with an isotonic drink. Thorpe: Big fan of fruit juice
This is the diet I have for six days out of seven a week. It is pretty boring and can get frustrating because I love my chocolate. The other night of the week, I go out to a restaurant with my friends and eat whatever I want. Maybe I will go out to a Japanese place and have some Sashimi which is a meal I really love. If I ever really need a snack on my day off I will have sopmething like Caramel Space Food Sticks. These are long chewy energy sticks which are really tasty. Share food tips on our message boards
This helps me to keep a bit of normality in my life. It would be ridiculous if I ate healthily every time I was hungry. Even top swimmers need to have a little bit of fun every now and then!
