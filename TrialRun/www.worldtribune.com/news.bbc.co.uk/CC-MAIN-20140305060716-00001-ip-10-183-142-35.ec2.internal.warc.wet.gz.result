Turkey currency plunge
Turks face more inflation as the lira tumbles
The Turkish currency lost 28% of its value on Thursday, after the government floated the lira to resolve a serious economic crisis.
The crisis had been triggered by a political row between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, over the government's record in tackling corruption.
On the foreign currency markets, the lira lost as much as 37% during trading in the morning. But by the end of the day it had recovered 9% of its value.
Ecevit: Committed to fighting inflation
Speaking after the decision to remove the currency controls, Prime Minister Ecevit said he was committed to continuing the country's reforms and still viewed fighting inflation as a priority.
He added the government would wait for the lira exchange rate to settle before taking necessary action.
A slight recovery
By the end of Thursday, the stock markets in Istanbul rebounded 10%.
Inter-bank interest rates - the rate at which the banks lend money to each other - also responded favourably.
They had risen above 5000% on Wednesday, as the government held a marathon session to decide on its response to the crisis.
By the end of Thursday, they had eased to about 1,200%.
Meanwhile, Mr Ecevit's opponents, including Tansu Ciller, head of the conservative True Path Party, called for his resignation.
Ms Ciller said on Thursday that the Prime Minister no longer enjoys public confidence in the country's economic reform programme.
Cornerstone
The floating of the lira undermines a cornerstone of the government's three-year anti-inflation programme, backed by $11bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The IMF's Horst Kohler supports floating lira
Despite this, IMF managing director Horst Kohler said the organisation supported the Turkish Government's move, adding that it "should help stabilise the exchange rate and ensure - possibly after an initial increase - that the inflation rate continues to decline".
But he also said the "macroeconomic framework for the economic program" would have to be revised.
Ms Ciller was more critical.
"The programme has collapsed. This is a new burden on the public. This is obvious devaluation to be followed by inflation," she said.
Inflation currently stands at an annual rate of about 30%, down from 70% in 1999.
The government's plans to bring it down to single digits by the end of 2002 are regarded as crucial to the country's hopes of moving forward its application to join the European Union.
The Turkish problems are in fact more political than economic
Professor Faruk Selcuk of Bilkent University
On Wednesday the Turkish stock market saw its steepest fall ever, losing 18%.
Panicked investors drained over $7bn from central bank reserves on Monday, prompting the unprecedented rise in interest rates.
Rift continues
Mr Ecevit stormed out of a national security council meeting on Monday claiming he had been insulted.
He later demanded an apology, and is reported to be refusing to attend regular meetings with the president.
Turkish media said President Sezer accused Mr Ecevit of being "too passive" in the fight against corruption, of trying to prevent an investigation of the banking sector and of "not respecting" laws.
Allegations of corruption within the banks scared off foreign investors and led to a financial crisis in November, from which markets had only just begun to recover.
"The Turkish problems are in fact more political than economic," said professor of economy Faruk Selcuk, at Ankara's Bilkent University.
BBC Istanbul correspondent Chris Morris says that both Mr Ecevit and Mr Sezer are seen as honest men, but they preside over a system where corruption is deeply entrenched. Some investigations have been closing in on people in positions of real power, and President Sezer has made it clear that he believes no one should be deemed untouchable. Mr Ecevit's main concern is trying to maintain government stability. But the corruption investigations have created a deep sense of unease in Turkish politics.

Suharto tops corruption rankings
Former President Suharto of Indonesia tops the all-time corruption league table, an anti-graft group says.
Transparency International(TI), in its Global Corruption Report, uses the list to show how political corruption and private bribery hurt development.
Suharto's alleged haul of $15-$35bn in 31 years of rule, TI said, demonstrated how abuse of power "undermines the hopes... of developing countries".
Close behind is Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, who allegedly looted $5bn.
His haul, said TI, was particularly high in a country with an average GDP of just $100 a person.
It amounted to 40% of the $12bn in aid Zaire - now the Democratic Republic of Congo - received during his 32-year rule.
"The abuse of political power for private gain deprives the most needy of vital public services, creating a level of despair that breeds conflict and violence," said TI's founder and chairman Peter Eigen.
Repatriation
In producing this year's report TI has focused on political corruption, partly to highlight new conventions which it hopes will help the fight against graft.
GRAFT TOP TEN
Suharto: $15-35bn(Indonesia, 1967-98)
Ferdinand Marcos: $5-10bn(Philippines, 1972-86)
Mobutu Sese Seko: $5bn(Zaire, 1965-97)
Sani Abacha: $2-5bn(Nigeria, 1993-98)
Slobodan Milosevic: $1bn(Yugoslavia, 1989-2000)
J-C Duvalier: $300-800m(Haiti, 1971-86)
Alberto Fujimori: $600m(Peru, 1990-2000)
Pavlo Lazarenko: $114-200m(Ukraine, 1996-7)
Arnoldo Aleman: $100m (Nicaragua, 1997-2002)
Joseph Estrada: $78-80m(Philippines, 1998-2001)
Source: Transparency International. All sums are estimates of alleged embezzlement
The United Nations Convention against Corruption was completed on 9 December last year, while the African Union's own convention came out in July 2003.
Ratification of these conventions, said TI UK chief Laurence Cockcroft, would help root out corrupt politicians and - just as importantly - get the stolen cash back home.
The UN Convention, he said, "provides a formal framework for mult-lateral action" by law enforcement.
"And it greatly improves the scope for repatriation of assets by cutting through the legal obscurantism of the past."
That could - for example - help Nigeria recover the $2bn-$5bn estimated to have been stolen by late President Sani Abacha.
Switzerland has promised to hand back more than $500m in its banks, but less progress is being made on the $1bn-plus held in London.
Still in office
TI is not alone in looking into corruption in public life.
Of particular interest in recent months has been the energy and minerals industry.
While TI's list focuses on politicians who are either dead or under investigation, others - such as resource exploitation specialists Global Witness - have gone further.
In a recent report, Global Witness accused several current leaders of looting their own treasuries.
Among them are:
Angola's President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, whom it says keeps large sums in bank accounts abroad
Equatorial Guinea, whose President Teodoro Obiang calls oil revenues a "state secret" but is accused of keeping oil companies' payments in a bank in Washington DC under his own name
Kazakhstan, where a bungled attempt to smear a rival led to President Nursultan Nazarbayev inadvertently revealing $1bn in state funds placed abroad "for the good of the country".
Angola on Thursday rejected accusations that the president and other senior government officials had benefited by millions of dollars from illicit deals. In a statement issued by the Angolan embassy in London, the government said the allegations were baseless and could not be proved.

Monday, July 5, 1999 Published at 13:44 GMT 14:44 UK
Business: The Company File
Power firm buys AA
Millions of AA members will receive windfall payments of ï¿½240
British gas supply company Centrica has confirmed that it is buying the UK's leading roadside breakdown organisation, the Automobile Association.
The BBC's Greg Wood: "One of life's more unusual matches"Centrica - which operates the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands - said two weeks ago that it was in talks with the AA and has now announced a ï¿½1.1bn ($1.74bn) buyout.
Legal details connected with demutualisation of the AA are thought to have taken longer than expected, delaying the announcement.
If the deal is approved by the AA's four-and-a-half million owner-members, they stand to gain windfall payments of ï¿½240 each.
Another five-million members who are covered by manufacturer or company fleet schemes will not receive any money.
The two groups said the deal - which is expected to be completed in the last quarter of the year - would create savings of at least ï¿½85m a year by 2002. The AA's pre-tax profit in 1998 was ï¿½19.7m on a turnover of ï¿½627.3m.
The AA's financial services and insurance business will be incorporated into Centrica's own.
Some staffing 'overlap'
Gas supplier Centrica turns up the heat on its competitorsRoy Gardner, chief executive of Centrica, said: "The shareholders of Centrica stand to gain from substantial progression towards our goal of becoming a leading provider of high-quality consumer services.
"The members of the AA will benefit from our commitment to invest and develop the liveried roadside recovery business currently operated by the AA."
He also said there were no plans to reduce the roadside recovery workforce, but that there were "overlaps" in jobs between Centrica and the rest of the AA's 12,000 employees.
Bold move
Sir Brian Shaw, chairman of the committee of the AA, said the sale to Centrica was necessary because of a changing market.
"Whilst we have a leading market position now, changes to the roadside services market mean that the interests of the AA, its members, customers and staff will be best served by being part of a larger group," he said.
Acquiring the AA - which has 48% share of the UK roadside breakdown market - is Centrica's boldest step yet in its quest to widen the home-related consumer services it offers its 16.7m UK customers.
Centrica has already introduced its huge customer base to Goldfish credit cards, home insurance and plumbing services. It has also won the largest influx of new customers in the recently liberalised electricity supply markets.
RAC also bought out
In April, the car leasing company, Lex Services, bought the UK breakdown industry's number two, the RAC, for ï¿½437m ($690m).
The deal gave the RAC's 12,000 full members windfall payments of more than ï¿½34,000 each.
The RAC is about half the size of the AA in terms of revenue and market share.
In another venture, Centrica is said to be close to a deal with telecoms company Energis to launch a telephone service.
If reports are accurate, the telephone service would use BT's local lines and Energis's trunk network, offering calls at a substantial discount.
In 1998, Centrica made a pre-tax profit of ï¿½208m on a turnover of ï¿½7.48bn.
After the early morning announcement that it was taking over the AA, Centrica's share price was 2 pence higher by 1400 BST at 151p.

Carly Simon suing over CD failure
Carly Simon is planning her first concerts in Europe next year. Carly Simon is suing Starbucks for failing to properly promote her 2008 album This Kind of Love.Her lawsuit claims the album was not available in "a substantial number" of Starbucks stores during the important early months following its release. Simon also claims offering the album at sale price "stigmatised" it. In a statement, the coffee chain said it had fulfilled all its obligations regarding the CD but it had only had a "tepid response" from customers. Mixed reviewsCarly Simon followed in the footsteps of Sir Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell by signing with Starbucks' Hear Music Label, a joint venture with Concord Music. But days before the album's release in April of this year, the company announced it was handing day to day running of the label to Concord. Simon claims without Starbucks's backing she could not get the promotion and distribution she was promised. In an interview with the New York Times Simon admitted the album had got some negative reviews, saying: "I always get mixed reviews." But she says "you can't sell a product that's not in stores". The singer, whose biggest hits include You're So Vain and Anticipation, is seeking unspecified damages. She is due to release another album, Never Been Gone, later this month on Iris Records.

Rafsanjani urges talks with West
By Jon Leyne
BBC News, Tehran
Mr Rafsanjani's comments contrast with those of the president
The former President of Iran, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has called on the West to engage in talks on the nuclear issue.
His plea is in marked contrast to defiant comments made by President Ahmedinejad earlier this week. Mr Rafsanjani has just been voted head of Iran's Assembly of Experts - one of the most influential positions in the country's political system.
His comments suggest he may use his influence to challenge the hardline approach of President Ahmedinejad.
Mr Rafsanjani assured the West that Iran was not seeking a nuclear weapon. The nuclear programme would be used in the service of humanity, he said. He urged the West to negotiate over the issue. Boasts
By contrast, earlier in the week, President Ahmedinejad proudly boasted about the progress in Iran's nuclear work and he mocked the West over its failure to prevent the programme. However, he has also insisted it is purely for peaceful purposes. In Iran's complicated and secret political system there is an ongoing battle for power behind the scenes, with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, as the deciding force. It is clear that right now President Ahmedinejad is facing tough competition from a number of directions.

Sensitive giant probes atomic world
By Jonathan Fildes
Science and technology reporter, BBC News
Titan is housed in a ï¿½500,000 hi-tech climate controlled room
City-dwelling scientists wanting to escape the cacophony of urban life could do worse than land a job at the home of one of the UK's most powerful microscopes.
The vault in which the behemoth is housed is buried deep under the streets that flank the Albert Hall in London. Once the double doors - designed to eliminate contamination of all kind, not just noise - suck shut, the room takes on the air of a mausoleum. Even the technicians and scientists gathered at the base of Titan, as the microscope is known, talk in hushed, respectful tones. But their silence is not just for the benefit of their fellow academics, it is an operational requirement of the machine. "If the sample drifts, it kills the experiment," said Dr David McComb of Imperial College London, where the microscope is housed. With a machine that is able to image individual atoms, even the vibrations caused by talking too loudly are enough to shunt a sample. When scientists are operating at such small scales, tiny shifts can appear huge.
"The drift rate has got to be better than one nanometre per minute," he explained. One nanometre is a billionth of a metre.
"It's about how much your finger nail grows in less than one second," said Dr James Perkins, one of the research scientists who use the sensitive giant to probe the atomic structure of the world. Random scatter
Titan is a transmission electron microscope, the first of its kind in the UK and one of only a handful found in labs around the world.
Its maker, FEI Company, says it is the most powerful commercially available scope on the market. Titan can image objects billionths of a metre across
Enlarge Image When it is running at full power it will be used to probe everything from new materials for ultra fast computers to tissue samples that may shed light on diseases such as Alzheimer's. The ï¿½2.4m ($4.8m) scope is capable of imaging objects just 0.14 nanometres in diameter, useful for probing the atomic structure and chemistry of materials. It works by firing electrons through an incredibly thin sample, just microns (one millionth of a metre) thick, and observing the changes to the particles as they pass through and out the other side. "What happens to the electrons tells us about how the atoms were arranged in the sample," said Dr McComb. In essence, the trajectories of the electrons can be mapped, like snooker balls scattering on a table. Knowing their trajectory as they exit allows scientists to build up a picture of the internal structure of the sample. In addition, measuring the energy lost by electrons gives scientists clues about the identity of the atoms in the sample and how they bond together. "That is enormously powerful," said Dr McComb. Research boost
The machine has been bought by the London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN) using money from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
It was installed in August 2006 and should soon be running at full power.
We're ramping up, we're starting to get results
David McComb
Already there is a raft of projects that could use the super-scope. Medical researchers, for example, hope to use it to uncover the secrets of bone disease. "Clearly, if we want to tackle diseases like osteoporosis, we need new drugs and clinical trials," said Dr McComb. "But in order to develop those we also need to understand the process of osteoporosis. We need to understand how bone and tissue interact and why that process changes as we get older."
Teams have proposed to use Titan to examine the microscopic and chemical changes on the surfaces of bones in both healthy and diseased tissue. Other teams want to understand the role of iron metabolism in the development of Alzheimer's disease. "We are not quite sure what the state of the iron is or how it interacts with the tissues in the brain," said Dr McComb. "But if we can understand that then potentially we can feed that into research into something that can disrupt or modify that process." Researchers from LCN are also queuing up to test new materials for efficient fuel cells and catalysts, as well as examining the atomic structure of semiconductors to optimise or boost their performance in future computers. Eventually, the knowledge gained will also allow scientists to start building materials atom by atom.
"We're ramping up, we're starting to get results," said Dr McComb. "I expect over the summer we'll really start rocketing."

Cherie: The papers' verdict
Opinion was divided on Mrs Blair's statement
Cherie Blair's tearful admission that she is "no superwoman" certainly succeeded in tugging a few heart strings in Fleet Street.
The Daily Mail's normally merciless sketch writer Quentin Letts even admitted to "a smidgen of pity, maybe even a scintilla of guilt" as he watched Mrs Blair speak.
But it was clearly a temporary blip and his observation that tears were "every woman's nuclear option," set the tone for the remainder of his piece.
It is not a newspaper's job to hate
The Sun
The Mail has led the pack in pursuit of the Foster story, but it softened its tone markedly on Wednesday.
The paper was perhaps, as The Guardian pointed out, mindful that its core constituency are the busy working mothers, "with a lot of balls to juggle in the air", that Mrs Blair powerfully aligned herself with in her statement.
Like all of the papers, it insisted questions remained unanswered.
The only argument was over how many.
'Sob story'
The Mail must have thought it had all bases covered with eight.
But it was comprehensively trumped by the Daily Mirror, with a whopping 15 questions.
Taking the harshest line of any of the tabloids, the Mirror labelled Mrs Blair's statement a "sob story". "Cherie weeps about her kids, jobs and charity work but was it real remorse or more spin to save her skin," the paper's front page screamed.
Few of the papers could resist comparisons with Princess Diana and her, in Quentin Letts' phrase, "text book victim interview with Panorama".
'Hardworking mum'
Andrew Sparrow, in the Telegraph, even detected an echo of Stephen Byers, when Mrs Blair spoke of "people who knew her well". Her economy with the truth in response to the Mail on Sunday a week and a half ago was a serious and disappointing lapse of judgement
The Guardian
There was no doubt that Mrs Blair's tears were tabloid gold.
The Sun, in particular, oozed sympathy, declaring "Cherie won the heart of every mum in the country".
"It would take a heart of stone not to feel for this tearful, hardworking mum trying to make "Tony and the country proud", said the paper's political editor, Trevor Kavanagh.
But he also notes: "The tears were real, but "could not have been choreographed more effectively if the words "sob now" had been written into her script by Alastair Campbell."
'Wounded mother'
Spying an opportunity to take a swipe at its rivals in the Mail camp, the paper's editorial loftily declared "Cherie's speech will stick in the craw of those who hate her.
"But we do not hate her - and if our rivals think that makes us Tony Cronies they'll have to lump it. It is not a newspaper's job to hate."
The Daily Telegraph called Mrs Blair's performance "Part Diana, Princess of Wales, part accomplished barrister, part wounded mother, part Clintonesque hair-splitter"
But it also accused Mrs Blair of using her son Euan as a "human shield" to deflect questions about the extent of her involvement with Peter Foster.
'Political triumph'
It concluded the prime minister's wife would have been better off not making her statement at all, as it raised more questions than it answered.
"This morning Caesar's wife deserves some sympathy, but she has failed to put herself above suspicion," said the paper's leader column.
The Guardian also had harsh words for Mrs Blair. "Her economy with the truth in response to the Mail on Sunday a week and a half ago was a serious and disappointing lapse of judgement."
But the paper said her statement was "coherent" and "persuasive on a personal level". Questions remain, but Mrs Blair had "seen off the main allegations".
More than that, she had revealed her personality to the public for the first time, and, as a result, "may have turned a sorry episode into something akin to a personal and political triumph."

BBC News | SCOTLAND | S28 repeal 'on course' in Scotland

S28 repeal 'on course' in Scotland
Many peers say schools should promote marriage
The repeal of Section 28 is scheduled to go ahead in Scotland despite the Lords voting against scrapping the controversial clause in England.
The Scottish bill repealing the legislation, which prevents the promotion of homosexuality in schools, will be the first major piece of devolved legislation to differ from Westminster.
Last month, MSPs voted in favour of repealing Section 28 and the bill will shortly go forward for royal assent. Peers rejected banning the clause by 42 votes
But on Monday evening, 42 peers in the House of Lords defied UK Government wishes and voted to retain the 12-year-old law in England and Wales.
The Scottish Executive remained defiant throughout that the clause had to go.
Fierce opposition came from Scottish businessman Brian Souter, who helped set up the Keep the Clause campaign group, and the Catholic Church in Scotland.
They were eventually placated by a compromise in new guidance on sex education in schools which spotlights marriage. At Westminster, Local Government Minister Hilary Armstrong said she was "very disappointed" at the Lords vote.
It is the second time peers have rejected government plans to scrap Section 28 and ministers must now decide whether to drop the proposal in England and Wales.
It had been widely expected that if peers inflicted another defeat, the government would forego the repeal clause rather than lose its Local Government Bill in which plans for repeal appear.

1965: Millions watch space probe crash into Moon
A ground-breaking 15-minute live broadcast has shown ordinary Americans what it feels like to be a space probe hurtling to destruction on the Moon.
The extraordinary pictures from the Ranger 9 moon lander were beamed out directly from the spacecraft's internal cameras.
They were switched on at about 0850 local time (1350 GMT) as the probe fell from a height of 1,468 miles (2,363 km) towards the Moon's surface.
Television viewers were then taken on a dizzying journey as Ranger 9 crashed headlong into the pock-marked crater Alphonsus, near the centre of the Moon's face.
Kamikaze missions
Ranger 9 was the last of the moon probes sent on so-called kamikaze missions in which they are deliberately aimed at the surface of the Moon to take as many images as possible before being destroyed on impact.
The previous two, Rangers 7 and 8, sent back thousands of photographs of the Moon before hitting its surface.
But Ranger 9 was equipped to convert its signals into a form suitable for showing on domestic television, and brought images of the Moon into ordinary homes.
Viewers of the astonishing live broadcast saw a series of pictures, starting with three flat craters - Ptolemaeus, 85 miles (137 km) in diameter, Alphonsus, 50 miles (80 km) across, and Albategnius, 60 miles (96 km) wide.
As the spacecraft drew closer to the Moon's surface, the area photographed became large in scale and focussed on the crater Alphonsus. Large roads
At five minutes from impact, 400 miles (644 km) from the surface, pronounced channels looking like large roads appeared. At 177 miles (285 km) away, the surface appeared pockmarked and rough, like a close-up of human skin. Pictures remained sharp and clear as little as a third of a mile (540 metres) from the surface, and then the screen suddenly went black as the probe landed. The final picture was made when the spacecraft was just two-tenths of a second from impact, and scientists hope it will reveal new details about the Moon's crust.
Scientists will now analyse the pictures, along with over 11,000 images from Rangers 7 and 8.
The successful mission comes just 24 hours after the launch of Gemini III, the second stage in America's race to land a man on the Moon. The spacecraft has two astronauts on board - the first time America has sent two astronauts into space at the same time - and will orbit the Earth three times before coming down to land.

In Context
The Ranger 9 moon lander pictures temporarily pushed the United States ahead of the Soviet Union in the space race.
The pictures showed that the Moon's surface was capable of bearing the weight of a manned spacecraft - a key issue for Nasa scientists at the time. It also showed that although choosing a landing site among the craters and mountain ranges would be difficult, it would not be impossible.
The pictures were used in developing the Surveyor lunar landers, the first of which were launched in 1966.
However, they were beaten to it by the USSR's Luna 9 lander, which in February 1966 sent back the first pictures from the surface of the Moon. Surveyor 1 landed four months later.
When the United States landed Neil Armstrong on the moon on 21 July 1969, he stepped down in the area known as the Sea of Tranquillity - chosen as a likely landing spot from photographs taken by Ranger 8.

Man Utd boss Alex Ferguson praises Paul Scholes display
Scholes produced a man-of-the-match display at Wembley
Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson hailed midfielder Paul Scholes for his man-of-the-match display in the 3-1 Community Shield win over Chelsea.Scholes produced a superb performance, the highlight of which was a raking pass to Wayne Rooney in the build-up to Antonio Valencia's opening goal. "He's just an incredible footballer," said Ferguson of the 35-year-old. "It's a phenomenon that he goes out there and becomes man of the match approaching his 36th birthday." The display justified Ferguson talking the former England midfielder - who rejected overtures to return to the international fold for this summer's World Cup - out of retiring at the end of last season. "This time last year, he's saying to himself, 'This is my last season' - and a lot of people thought that," stated Ferguson.
PAUL FLETCHER BLOG
The first blow of what is sure to be a long battle has been landed by United
"It came across my mind also, simply because he's had a lot of injuries in his career. He keeps coming back; it's not easy to do that. Ferguson also praised striker Dimitar Berbatov after his goalscoring display in Sunday's game. Berbatov - who scored only 12 goals last season - came off the bench to seal United's win at Wembley with a superb injury-time chip, after Chelsea's Salomon Kalou's goal had made it 2-1 with seven minutes left. "He has great talent. You can't dispute the man's ability - he's a genius at times," added Ferguson. "He had a mixed last season but maybe it's going to be his season now." United captain Nemanja Vidic echoed his manager's sentiments about Bulgarian Berbatov, who came on at half-time and formed a promising link with new signing Javier Hernandez.
Berbatov chipped in United's third goal
"It's important for him to score the goals," said Vidic. "He had a lot of pressure last year and I hope this year he will score more goals and we will try to help him do that." Vidic suggested that the victory was the perfect springboard for his side to achieve success this season. "I believe there will be more trophies and this is just the beginning," commented the Serbian centre-back. "We showed we have a good squad and we have the hunger and energy to win more trophies." Ferguson also heaped praise on Mexican Hernandez, who has shone in pre-season and also scored on Sunday. "He's quick to get in the box - he's a really good finisher," said Ferguson. "He's got a bubbly character and speaks good English. He's settled in very well." United finished second in the Premier League behind champions Chelsea last season and Ferguson believes his side's positive display at Wembley - albeit in a game lacking the true intensity of a league fixture - is an indication of the readiness to challenge for honours again. "I'm happy with the display," declared the Scot. "Some of the football was very good at times and we created chances and deserved to win it. "When us and Chelsea play each other it is always competitive. Chelsea showed their desire in the last 10 minutes. It was nicely competitive but nothing too serious."

Berbatov, what a finish!!!I told you before and I'll tell you again he is a great player!!!!
"ericlemagnifique"
As important as their display was to Ferguson, equally vital was the chance to give some match time to those players, including England's Wayne Rooney, who featured in the World Cup and who were given extended rest during the summer following their exertions in South Africa. He also indicated that the midweek international friendlies - widely criticised for their timing - could assist some players in getting back to match fitness. "It was good for players to build up their fitness," he said. "I don't know if Wayne and Park [Ji-Sung] are ready yet but the internationals in the coming week are a bonus for them and I'm delighted they are involved. "We've got so many players away but having the [first Premier League] game [against Newcastle] on the Monday helps us. "I don't think anyone can understand why we've got an international friendly before the season starts but we've been given a bit of luck through that." Michael Carrick was a surprise starter after Ferguson said on Friday the midfielder would be sidelined for two weeks and miss the start of the season with an ankle injury.
Kalou's goal briefly gave Chelsea hope
"On Friday, I was certain Michael was out for two weeks," revealed Ferguson. "He came in yesterday, says he was fit, wanted to train, trained, and wanted to play. "The minute he says he's fit, we had to play him, simply because he needs game time." Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti felt his players were too slow throughout Sunday's match and were deservedly beaten but also believes the international friendlies will help in this regard. "Tactically we played too slow in the first half but this can happen at the start of the season," said Ancelotti. "It's impossible to ask our players to be quick after 10 days training before the start of the season. They have to improve their condition. It was important for them to play 90 minutes so this is a positive. "The players playing in the internationals could be a good thing to improve their condition. "Manchester played better than us. The positive is that it put more minutes on the legs of the players." Chelsea's defeat came on the back of pre-season friendly losses to Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hamburg. "I am not worried about the defeats," added the Italian. "Now is the time to start winning and we have to look to the start of the Premier League."

Around the Academy:
I'm Ronnie O'Sullivan and I'm one of the top snooker players in the world.
I'm going to pass on a few tips on the most important part of any snooker player's armoury - the grip.

I prefer to keep the flat of the cue pointing to the ceiling.
This helps me to hit straight through the ball for a good strike.
Don't hold the cue too tightly, but don't hold it too loose either.
Check out where to play snooker in your area
This will help you open the back of the hand to generate the power for the shot.
And hopefully you'll be racking up those century breaks in no time!
