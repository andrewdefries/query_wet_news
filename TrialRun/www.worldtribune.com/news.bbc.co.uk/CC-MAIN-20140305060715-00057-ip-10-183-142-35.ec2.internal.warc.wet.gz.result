Police blamed in Indonesia probe
By Karishma Vaswani
BBC News, Jakarta
Protesters support the actions of the anti-corruption watchdog, the KPK
An inquiry into a scandal known as Indonesia's Watergate says the police case against two anti-corruption officials should be dropped.The probe, set up by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was widely expected to find in favour of the two officials. Police had accused the two men - who worked for the country's powerful anti-corruption watchdog, the KPK - of extortion and abuse of power. But the case caused public outrage when it emerged they may have been framed. Public sympathy has been growing for the KPK, with almost daily protests on the streets of Jakarta, urging the president to act decisively. There was a huge public outcry against the arrest of the two men - Bibit Samad Rianto and Chandra Hamzah - that led to their release. Increasing pressureIndonesians do not have much faith in many of their institutions like the police force or the judiciary. But the anti-corruption commission is one thing many of them do believe in. They see the targeting of the two KPK men as an outrageous injustice - an attempt by Indonesia's police to weaken the powerful agency, which has earned itself a reputation for putting corrupt officials behind bars, even those in high places. President Yudhoyono was elected on promises to combat corruption
The president is now under increasing pressure to come up with a solution to this problem. He has been largely silent on the issue, and last week when this case was being debated in Indonesian media, he was in Malaysia on a state visit, and then in Singapore for the Apec summit. President Yudhoyono is now back in Jakarta and the calls for him to take action are getting louder. He was re-elected in July on his promise to clamp down on corruption. How he handles this case will be seen as a test of that commitment.

Aussie to take Coke helm
Long time Coke exec Douglas Daft is to take the helm
The Australians are taking the helm at another of America's giant corporations.
Ford's antipodean chairman Jac Nasser is already well settled in the driving seat of the global car maker.
Australians are not seen as 'global imperialists'
Industry analyst
Now Coca-Cola has brought the troubled reign of Douglas Ivester to an end after less than three years - and placed its future in the hands of Australian Douglas Daft. They now head the list of Aussie chief execs in the US - if News Corporation's chief Rupert Murdoch's American citizenship rules him out.
The decision to appoint Coke's first non-American chief would have additional benefits on the world stage with Australians not seen as 'global imperialists', according to one analyst.
Mr Ivester's decision to retire 13 years early at Coke came as a total surprise to analysts, staff and stock holders, despite the turbulent nature of his reign. French Orangina rebuff
Coke's previous chief had been at the helm for 16 years, and Mr Ivester had been expected to see the group through well into the next century.
His two-and- a-half-year turn coincided with a product contamination scare in Europe, a racial discrimination lawsuit and a flagging share price.
Retiring Coke chief Douglas Iversen
"After extensive reflection and thought, I have concluded that it is time for me to move on to the next stage of my life," said the 52-year-old.
The resignation came less than two weeks after the French government rebuffed Coca-Cola's $733m bid for Pernod-Ricard's Orangina drink brand for competitive reasons.
Coke said it accepted the resignation "reluctantly" but the timing of the announcement so soon after the failed Orangina bid has led to speculation that pressure from inside the company or from discontented shareholders had prompted a change.
Viewed as a "nuts-and-bolts, day-to-day operations" leader, Mr Ivester took over the reins of Coca-Cola in 1997 after the death of longtime chief exec Roberto Goizueta, who was credited with much of the company's rapid growth.
Radical change unlikely
Bu his leadership hit a low point last summer after a contamination scare hit Europe, damaging sales and the brand's reputation.
Coca-Cola traced the problem to a bad batch of carbon dioxide in Belgium and a foul odour from a chemical substance used on storage pallets at a cannery in France.
Mr Ivester also struggled to successfully fuel Coca-Cola's quest for further global dominance. A plan to acquire Cadbury-Schweppes' non- North American assets was drastically curtailed after the deal ran into regulatory trouble across the globe.
Originally valued at more than $1bn the deal was scaled back and closed in July with Coca-Cola paying Cadbury $705m for assets in 155 countries.
Analysts said it was unlikely Mr Ivester's successor would radically alter the company's ambitious growth strategy.
Mr Daft will take up the post in April next year.
More of a back-slapper
He began his career at Coca-Cola in 1969 in Australia, and is considered to have a broad knowledge of emerging markets, particularly in key growth markets in Asia.
For much of his career, Mr Daft served in planning, marketing and operations positions in the region.
"Daft is considered somewhat more diplomatic than Ivester - more of a back-slapper," said one analyst who wished to remain unnamed.
By reputation a highly logical executive with a hands-on manner, Ivester was hired away from the accounting firm Ernst & Whinney in the 1970s by his predecessor.
He was Coke's chief operating officer when Mr Goizueta died of lung cancer in October 1997.

Gorilla goes on Dutch zoo rampage
Visitors at the Dutch zoo take cover as the gorilla breaks free of its enclosure
Enlarge Image A 180kg (400-pound) gorilla has escaped from its enclosure and run amok at Rotterdam zoo in the Netherlands.
Witnesses reported seeing the gorilla, a dominant male, climb the enclosure's wall and apparently bite a woman, as well as injuring three other people.
The zoo was evacuated as the gorilla was subdued by a sedative dart after it sought refuge inside a zoo building.
The Diergaarde Blijdorp Zoo, which was packed with visitors on a holiday weekend, later reopened.
Many people in the Netherlands were taking advantage of a national holiday to make a long weekend.
Somehow Bokito escaped from his enclosure
The 11-year-old gorilla, called Bokito, managed to climb a high wall to escape from his enclosure.
"He got over the moat, which in itself is remarkable because gorillas can't swim," zoo director Ton Dorrestijn told reporters. Visitors then described scenes of panic, as families ran screaming from the animal.
"I saw the beast running through the park with a woman behind him, him grabbing her forearm," eyewitness Robert De Jonge told NOS radio.
"He bit her, or I think he bit her, because when he stood up his mouth was covered in blood," Mr De Jonge said.
Some visitors tried to barricade themselves in a restaurant, but Bokito smashed part of a door and gained entry. He was eventually trapped there by zoo staff and tranquilised. None of the injured was thought to be in a serious condition.

Peruvian farmers learn from history
Agricultural techniques perfected by Inca farmers 500 years ago are beginning to have a dramatic effect on the incomes of today's farmers in Pampachiri, one of the poorest areas of Peru.
The Inca style is unmistakeable
An ancient water transport system, developed by the Wira people and refined by the Incas, has been restored by the Cusichaca Trust NGO using traditional methods.
Clay, stone, sand, and a certain type of cactus juice, have restored the system of canals and terraces, in turn helping repair the area's shattered economy.
"This is what we specialise in - rather than using cement or other materials brought from outside," Douglas Walsh, of the Cusichaca Trust, told the BBC World Service's Discovery programme.
"We use locally-available materials to help farmers irrigate their terraced land."
Great Inca agriculture
The region is home to around 2,500 people, and agriculture - particularly livestock farming - is the key industry.
One of the farmers involved in the project, Juan Guillen, explained why the old methods were proving so effective. "The Incas were very good agronomists - they understood sustainable agriculture," Mr Guillen said.
"But this declined soon after the Spanish conquest. They were more interested in mining that farming."
Agriculture and livestock are the key industry in the region
More recently, the region's industry suffered because the rise of the guerrilla movement Shining Path drove many families out to the cities, afraid of conflict between the guerrillas and the Peruvian army.
"Survival became the overriding issue - farming was secondary," Juan explained.
However, some are now returning from the cities and settling back into agriculture - and the restoration of the Inca techniques is having a massive impact.
"By providing irrigation, we're actually allowing agricultural production to increase massively in the local area," said Tom Nickalls, the project engineer.
"Traditionally, where there is no irrigation farmers will choose an area and they will plant in that area, maybe three years running, and then they'll have to abandon the land for about seven years.
"One of the reasons for this is a lack of water, because we have a rainy season and a dry season.
"Whereas by providing irrigation by these terraces, the farmers are able to produce one crop at least every year, and sometimes in certain areas they can produce two crops a year.
"So instead of producing three crops every 10 years, they're producing somewhere between 10 and 15 crops."
Better training
Additionally, there is a bonus of using the Inca systems because on a practical level, nothing needs to be imported, whereas cement has to come from miles away and is expensive - much beyond the incomes of these subsistence farmers.
The canals themselves are metre-wide channels, surrounded by a wall of stones. The project is now suffering from lack of funding
To begin the restoration, several hundred tonnes of red clay had to be brought on roads of simple stone and mud by mules.
"It's a huge contribution by the community, which reflects their priority for irrigation and support for agriculture," said Mr Nicholls.
However, some farmers are keen that the restored canals are only the start.
"Over the past few years I've grown maize and broad beans - irrigation is a help, but I'd like to see more training in better sowing methods or other ways of increasing yields," said Julio, another Pampachiri farmer.
"We're accustomed here to growing only one crop a year.
"I'd like training in crop rotation - something that means the fields are in use the whole time."
However, other problems may become more immediate before that can happen - the Cusichaca Trust's work has recently been curtailed by a lack of funding.

Bardot appeal over animal slaughter at Nepal festival
Brigitte Bardot is a prominent animal rights activist
Former film star Brigitte Bardot has urged Nepal's president to stop a ritual slaughter of animals in an upcoming religious festival.The two-day Gadhimai festival next week will result in the killing of up to half a million animals. Ms Bardot, who is also an animal rights activist, wrote to President Ram Baran Yadav, saying that the practice was "violent, cruel and inhumane". Nepalese authorities say the mass sacrifice is an religious tradition. "I personally find it hard to imagine that your heart can withstand such cruelty, knowing that you, being the head of the country, are ultimately responsible," said Ms Bardot, 75, in her letter to Mr Yadav. "I have dedicated my life to protect animals and the best gift I could receive for this life-long struggle would be the announcement of the stopping of ritual sacrifice of animals." The government has not yet reacted to Ms Bardot's letter.

A suitable job for a woman
Angela Berners-Wilson spent nine years as a parish priest
In 1994, Angela Berners-Wilson became the first woman to be ordained as a Church of England priest.
The move came after centuries of male domination and decades of debate.
More than 10 years later, as a new debate rages about whether women should become bishops, she speaks about her experiences.
Angela had wanted to become a priest since her final year of university, when she became sure of her vocation. On graduating, she entered the Church of England and became a deaconess in 1979 and of deacon in 1987 - the highest post then available to a woman. But until 1994, she was unable to fulfil her vocation to be come a priest - a dream she spent 15 years campaigning to achieve.
Traditional
After her ordination in a ceremony along with 31 other women, Angela, now 50, was made rector of a country parish in north Wiltshire, where she initially faced some resistance from her parishioners. She says: "It was a very traditional place and looking back now, it's amazing that they accepted me. "Some of them found it quite strange to have a woman priest to start with - I think the Royal British Legion members were the hardest to convince. There are so many of us now, it's no longer exceptional to find a woman priest
Angela Berners-Wilson
"But once they got used to me, they started to appreciate my work and most people accepted me. There were one or two die-hards who did not."
Things have changed considerably since Angela was ordained, with women now making up about a quarter of Church of England priests. She said: "There are so many of us now, it's no longer exceptional to find a woman priest."
Opposition
Even so, she says there are still some parishes around the country which still oppose women priests. Angela is now in a new post as university chaplain and ecumenical team leader at the University of Bath. Before the rules changed to allow the ordination of women, Angela became a deacon - the highest position then open to women within the Church. She worked as a chaplain at Bristol University, where her colleagues supported of her desire to become a priest. She said: "They were very pro-women priests, as was the Bishop of Bristol, so they were very supportive, but it has not been the same for women in many other parts of the country.
I'm looking forward to being invited to the ordination of the first woman bishop in this country - whoever she may be
Angela Berners-Wilson
"Ironically, the church which was chosen for me to have my licensing ceremony for my current job in Bath was St Mary's Bathwick, which is in benefice with another church, St John's which is one of those which still refuses to have anything to do with women priests." Angela agrees with those who think the Church should let women become bishops, if that is where their vocation lies. She says: "If you're allowed to be ordained a priest, then the right women should be allowed to be bishops.
"People are called to these roles, it's a vocation, not just a job, so it's not something you aspire to, but it's seems wrong to me to be ruled out just because of your gender. "I think the Church should be the first place, not the last place to recognise all God's children."
However, she says the controversy must not be allowed to get out of control. She said: "It's a great privilege to be a priest. I wouldn't want the argument about women bishops to deflect from the real mission of the Church.
"But I'm looking forward to being invited to the ordination of the first woman bishop in this country - whoever she may be."

Personal alarms for abuse victims
Victims of domestic abuse in an area of Derbyshire are being offered personal and home safety alarms.
North East Derbyshire District has launched the project with the area's community safety partnership.
The alarms will be linked to the council's 'Carecall' telephone monitoring system, where trained officers will offer advice.
Project leaders said it hoped it would help victims feel less vulnerable after leaving violent partners.
Councillor Geoff Butler said: "Violence is one of the few areas of crime where we are not experiencing a reduction. "Roughly a half of violent crime is domestic in nature, and we, working with the police and other agencies, are determined to reduce it. "This project is one of number of actions we are taking, to this end." E-mail this to a friend

Hoddle becomes political football
Glenn Hoddle departed as England coach after Blair's comments
Tory leader William Hague has stepped up the attack on the prime minister for "poking his nose" into the row leading to the sacking of the former England football coach Glenn Hoddle. Speaking during prime minister's question Mr Hague asked to jeers: "Who should be the next manager of the England football team?"
Amid Labour cries of "Own goal", Mr Blair replied "I am content to leave that to the Football Association."
Political Editor Robin Oakley: "Mr Blair accused of meddling"The Tory leader responded: "We all thought Glenn Hoddle's remarks were outrageous.
"But will he accept for future reference and on reflection that there is a limit to the number of things that politicians should poke their noses into."
William Hague tells Tony Blair "there is a limit"The prime minister said: "I really cannot believe he is raising this.
"By making the comment himself he has actually commented on the issue. I suggest he looks at what I actually said."
In his attacks on the prime minister Mr Hague was referring to remarks made Mr Blair on ITV's This Morning with Richard and Judy programme on Monday.
Tony Blair: "I suggest he looks at what I actually said."In a live interview, the prime minister said Mr Hoddle should leave his job if the reports on his remarks about the disabled proved accurate. Tony Blair faces a packed House for prime minister's questionsMr Hoddle stepped down from his post as England coach my mutual agreement with the Football Association on Tuesday following public outrage over remarks he was said to have made about disabled people. In the meantime, the prime minister's office had contacted Mr Hoddle again to "explain" to him further details of Mr Blair's view.
But this did little to counter the growing accusations that the head of the government had added impetus to the "witch-hunt" against the football coach.
Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major accused Mr Blair of succumbing to a "mob mentality" in commenting on the matter.
Sir Bert Millichip, former chairman of the Football Association, also described remarks by Mr Blair and Sports Minister Tony Banks as "unforgivable". Sir Bert said: "It was a most difficult decision and not made any easier by the pressure that came from outside, in particular the prime minister and the minister for sport. "I am sure the acting chairman of the Football Association could have done without that sort of pressure."

Couples 'to have two IVF cycles'
Couples in Wales will be able to have two cycles of IVF treatment from April 2010
Women in Wales will have access to two cycles of IVF fertility treatment free on the NHS from April next year, the health minister has announced.Since 2005, women in Wales have had access to one cycle of IVF treatment. Edwina Hart said she was "keen to increase the number of IVF treatment cycles... within available resources". In June, the chair of the assembly's health committee said people in Wales should be able to have three IVF cycles of treatment on the NHS, as in England. In her statement, Ms Hart said: "I recognise that this is an extremely emotive issue. "In Wales, our aim has been to have a fair, consistent policy for accessing this treatment. "We ended the postcode lottery to accessing this service in 2005 when we began offering one free cycle of IVF treatment to women who meet clinical criteria set out by NICE and the All Wales Assisted Fertility Working Group. 'Better chances'"I have had lots of representations on this issue and I am pleased that I am in a position to go some way towards increasing the opportunities for women to try to have children within the available resources." Peter Bowen Simpkins, medical director of the London Women's Clinic, which has branches in Cardiff and Swansea as well as London, said the decision was good news for women undergoing IVF. He said when the guidelines by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) were drawn up, the clinic's IVF fertility treatment success rate was 30%-35% for women under 35. He said it now stood at almost 50%. He said: "You can't be absolutely certain you can get pregnant in two cycles but, whatever, it's very good news for women in Wales. "Plainly the more cycles that are on offer, the better chances you have for everybody of getting pregnant. "Our only plea is that people should come and see us earlier as success rates start dropping after 35." Embryo mix-upIn June, Darren Millar AM, chair of the Welsh assembly's health committee, said Wales should follow the advice of a national health guidance group and offer three cycles. His comment followed an embryo mix-up which denied a Bridgend couple the chance of another baby. Debra and Paul, from Bridgend, received damages of about £25,000 after the error in December 2007.

Los deslaves desentierran el pasado
James Painter
BBC Mundo
El lago Atitlan en Guatemala es conocido por ser uno de los lugares tur�sticos m�s visitados por estadounidenses y europeos, con su magn�ficos volcanes y sus maravillosas vistas. Panabaj fue tapado por el lodo y el barro. Pero a comienzos de la d�cada del 90, fue una de las regiones donde el ej�rcito llev� a cabo una brutal campa�a de contrainsurgencia contra los indios mayas del lugar, a los que acusaba de apoyar a las guerrillas de izquierda. Unos 600 poblados ind�genas fueron arrasados y miles murieron. Al menos uno de los poblados afectados por los deslaves tras el paso de Stan, Panabaj, fue uno de los escenarios de aquellas masacres.
En diciembre de 1990, soldados de la base de Panabaj dispararon contra una multitud compuesta por centenares de pobladores de Santiago Atitlan, que protestaban por el asesinato el d�a antes de uno de los suyos, presuntamente por un soldado pasado de copas.
Al menos 11 personas murieron ese d�a, tres de ellos ni�os, y varios m�s fueron heridos. Los pobladores reclamaron el cierre de la base y una investigaci�n.
La cuesti�n de declarar poblados enteros como cementerios es dif�cil para los indios mayas de Guatemala
El caso fue famoso en Guatemala, finalmente los demandantes fueron escuchados y el ej�rcito se retir�.
Observadores locales se�alan que la historia de esa regi�n, y de dicha masascre, vuelve ahora con la tragedia natural. Informes llegados desde Guatemala indican que algunas comunidades ind�genas no est�n recibiendo la ayuda ofrecida por el ej�rcito debido a lo ocurrido en el pasado.
La cuesti�n de declarar poblados enteros como cementerios tambi�n es dif�cil para los indios mayas de Guatemala. Sus creencias tradicionales exigen que los familiares reciban un entierro apropiado, debido a que su religi�n le otorga gran importancia al respeto que debe acompa�ar a los muertos.
Y cavar para buscar cad�veres de los deslaves debe traer terribles recuerdos para varios pobladores locales. En algunas �reas de Guatemala los antrop�logos forenses todav�a exhuman cuerpos enterrados 15 a�os atr�s en tumbas masivas para poder identificarlos.

Today: Monday 27th August
Labour says MPs must be given the chance to examine the government's decision to award the West Coast Main Line franchise to First Group; we talk to Richard Branson. What is the secret to curing the serial procrastinator? And, should Heathrow get a third runway?We are no longer providing clips of every part of the programme but you will be able to listen via the BBC iPlayer
.0615 Business news with Simon Jack. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0709 Should Heathrow Airport have another runway?
The former chancellor of the exchequer, Alistair Darling, explains why he is in favour of the move.
0713 Mitt Romney will be formally adopted as the Republican candidate at the party's convention in Tampa. Florida this week - it should happen today but the opening session has been canceled because of an approaching hurricane. With the opinion polls suggesting he and Obama are neck-and-neck, this is his opportunity to convince America he should be their next president. But, as the BBC's North America editor Mark Mardell reports, he has to balance pleasing his party, and appealing to swing voters. 0718 Business news with Simon Jack. 0721 A new Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) report argues that Sweden shows that free market reforms are economically beneficial and that an expansive welfare state is economically damaging and not the key factor in producing positive social outcomes. Is it true that our view of Sweden's success is a myth? The IEA's Mark Littlewood and Nick Pearce, of the think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, debate. 0726 Sports news with Rob Nothman. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0732 The drought in one part of West Africa has become so bad that nearly five million people are facing severe food shortages in one country alone. In Mali, two-thirds of the country has been taken over by Islamists, some of whom have links with al-Qaeda. A new unity government announced last week might have ended months of fractious rule after an army coup in March; but with pressure building for military action to retake the north, and food supplies at rock bottom, most people simply have their eyes on survival. Our correspondent Mike Thomson reports from Mali.
0740 Paper review.0743 Neil Armstrong has died at the age of 82. In 2009, we marked 40 years since the astronaut became the first man to set foot on the moon by hearing from people about what it meant to them at the time, we can return to another of those thoughts, by Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal. 0744 Do you find it hard to get things done? Do you leave tasks to the very last minute? Apparently you are not alone. One in five of us procrastinate to such an extent that it damages our careers, our health and our relationships - according to Professor Joseph Ferrari of DePaul University. It is the subject of a documentary on Radio 4 tomorrow, in which the writer Rowan Pelling meets fellow sufferers and experts to see if there is a cure for her lifelong problem. Also on the programme is Cary Cooper, Professor of Organizational Psychology and Health at Lancaster University Management School. 0748 Though for the Day, with Rev Prof David Wilkinson, Principal of St John's College, Durham University. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0752 More politicians have come out in support for a third runway at Heathrow, with Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson and Alistair Darling joining the chorus of voices calling for the project to be approved. Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, former transport spokesperson and Tim Yeo, Chairman of the Commons Climate Change Committee and former Conservative environment minister, who had been against expansion of Heathrow, debate if the project should go ahead.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0810 Opposition activists in Syria have accused the government of killing more than 300 people near Damascus. The Foreign Office says if the reports are true, it would "be an atrocity on a new scale". President Assad has called the uprising "a foreign plot". The BBC's Cairo correspondent Jon Leyne has the latest and the LSE's Prof Fawaz Gerges analyses the situation in the country. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0816 The Republican National Convention officially begins today, though proceedings will actually begin tomorrow, it is hoped, due to the threat of Tropical Storm Isaac. Colleen Graffy, a former deputy assistant secretary of state at the US State Department under President Bush and Associate Professor of Law at Pepperdine Law School in London, previews the political action.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0820 Three years ago on this programme we marked the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landings, by speaking to people about their memories of the moment Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. The astronaut has died at the age of 82. We hear from the actor Sir Patrick Stewart, perhaps best known as Star Trek's Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
0821 The man who did most to defeat the Germans was the Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov. He masterminded the defeat of the Nazis at Stalingrad - the battle that began 70 years ago this month, and one of the key turning points of the Second World War. Zhukov is still a hero in Russia, there was a 12-part television drama about him in Russia this year. And a new book, Stalin's General, looks at his rollercoaster life in the Soviet Union. Its author, Geoffrey Roberts, reflects on Zhukov's life and times and what they say about Stalinist Russia. 0826 Sports news with Rob Nothman.
Branson: PM should intervene on West Coast franchise
0831 When Virgin lost the franchise to run West Coast Main Line train services, Sir Richard Branson called the decision "insane". There is a Downing Street petition backing Virgin with more than 100,000 signatures, and Sir Richard himself has offered to keep the service running on a not-for-profit basis while the decision is reviewed. He explains his offer. 0838 Paper review. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0840 Is there a lion wandering around Clacton in Essex? Che Kevlin lives in St Osyth and thinks he heard it last night.
0843 The business news with Simon Jack.0849 There have been reports and eye witness accounts of a lion on the loose in Clacton in Essex. Nishan Wijeratni is a spokesman for Essex Police.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 0854 Where does hould George Orwell's true political identity lie and does he have universal appeal? Last week, Baroness Bakewell claimed that Mark Thompson, the outgoing Director General of the BBC, rejected a statue of Orwell outside Broadcasting House in London apparently telling her: "Oh no, Joan, we can't possibly. It's far too left-wing an idea." D.J Taylor, Biographer of Orwell and Dr Tony Wright, former Labour MP and Professor of Government and Public Policy at UCL, co-editor of Political Quarterly, debate.
