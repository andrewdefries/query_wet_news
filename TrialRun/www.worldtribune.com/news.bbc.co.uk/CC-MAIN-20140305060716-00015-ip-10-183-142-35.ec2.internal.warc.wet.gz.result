Iraqi treasures to tour US
The Warca vase was returned to the Baghdad museum
The Baghdad museum is lending some of its greatest treasures to the US, just months after fearing much of it had been looted. The museum in the Iraqi capital was hit by a wave of looting in the days following the fall of Baghdad.
But after recovering much of what was thought to have been stolen, the Iraq museum is keen to show off its items of cultural importance.
Among the valuables which will form part of a travelling exhibition is the collection of Assyrian jewellery known as the Nimrud artefacts.
The priceless array of 650 bracelets, necklaces, royal tiaras and semi-precious stones is thought to be among the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th Century and dates from the 8th Century BC.
It was discovered in the tombs of Assyrian queens and princesses during excavation near the northern town of Mosul between 1988 and 1992.
The Nimrud collection comprises 650 pieces It was among the pieces that were thought to have been lost during the looting but was later recovered from the Central Bank where it had been deposited in the 1990s.
Handed back
A Sumerian Warca vase, dating from 3200 BC, will also be allowed out of the country.
The vase, which was discovered in 1940 in the town of Samawa, was one of the artefacts looted from the museum in April
The piece was then found by three men who handed it back to authorities, with the museum paying them "expenses". "We are working on a travelling exhibition, which will be mounted for the first time in the United States within six to eight months," said Pietro Cordone, an Italian envoy charged with overseeing Iraq's cultural activities. "Along with these pieces of extraordinary beauty, including bracelets with clasps that still work, the American public will also be shown the Warca vase, a unique piece made of alabaster dating back to 3200 BC which portrays scenes from everyday life."

Hearing to probe US Muslim influences
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Heated debate, sharp accusations and public protests - they're not uncommon at US congressional hearings but this time it's all taking place before even the first witness has been called. The controversial issue of how vulnerable the American Muslim community is to radical influences like al Qaeda will be the topic of testimony at the homeland security committee. But as the BBC's Tom Burridge reports the hearing is already hitting a sour note for many. SEE ALSO

St Mirren boss MacPherson reeling after cup final loss
Gus MacPherson insists St Mirren missed a golden opportunity
St Mirren manager Gus MacPherson insists his dejected side will never have a better chance to win a cup.Nine-man Rangers won the Co-operative Insurance Cup final at Hampden courtesy of Kenny Miller's header. And MacPherson, who led Saints to their first final for 23 years, was stung by the Buddies' failure to capitalise. "It will live with the players for a long time," he said. "What a fantastic opportunity; it's a sore one for us, but we've got to take it on the chin." St Mirren impressed at Hampden, despite failing to find a way past keeper Neil Alexander in a goalless first half.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The Buddies' were handed a further boost when Kevin Thomson and Danny Wilson both received red cards as tempers threatened to boil over. "We made the change (after the red cards) and got Craig Dargo and Andy Dorman on; trying to get our attack-minded players on the pitch," said MacPherson. "We pushed as many players forward but we left ourselves open to the counter-attack. "And we made wrong decisions and were punished for them. That's the quality of a good ball into the box and Kenny Miller finishes it. "We've been caught with a real sucker-punch."
We just lacked a bit of craft in the final third
St Mirren manager Gus MacPherson
MacPherson expressed disappointment for his squad, adding: "Every single St Mirren supporter who was here today should be proud of them. "I think the fans will have the same emotions as us. When you look at it, with Rangers down to nine men, and we can't get that goal. "It was probably the period of the game where we were least effective. Rangers just sat there to frustrate us. "They got a couple of set-pieces and corners to put us under pressure. We just lacked a bit of craft in the final third." MacPherson said his job was to raise morale ahead of facing Celtic on Wednesday and Aberdeen at the weekend, as the Buddies look to banish their relegation fears.
