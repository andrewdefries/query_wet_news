Plastic surgery boom
Cosmetic surgery is more popular than ever in the UK
More Britons are turning to the knife in search of the body beautiful, a new report has revealed.
Plastic surgery is becoming increasingly popular with a 50% increase in the number of operations carried out over the past five years, according to the report in She magazine.
Melinda Messenger decided bigger was better
While men are demanding bigger breasts for their partners, women want their
husbands and boyfriends to fight the flab with liposuction, the magazine
claims.
Last year the nation spent �158.6m on cosmetic surgery, with breast
enlargement topping the table as the most popular operation.
Liposuction, nose jobs, eye-bag removal and facelifts follow in a list of the five most sought after procedures. The report reveals the facts behind Britain's increasing obsession with appearance
and includes "shocking" before and after photographs of operations.
Jocelyne Wildenstein: Wanted to look like a cat
Each year, the report claims, 65,000 cosmetic surgery operations are carried out
in the UK.
And surgeons are used to getting all kinds of requests - one American woman wanted her gums reduced so they did not show when she smiled, while another
wanted her nipples to stick out permanently.
Breast enlargement is by far the most popular operation, not just in the UK but also in France, Germany and Sweden, while beach-crazy Brazilians opt for bottom implants.

London shines in school tables
By Katherine Sellgren BBC News education and family reporter
Do the league tables alter the view on London's schooling?
London is the highest performing region in England at GCSE level, the latest secondary school league tables show.The data shows 54% of pupils achieved the benchmark of five GCSEs at A* to C, including English and maths, in 2009. This is a striking turn-around in just over a decade - in 1997, just 29.9% of London's pupils reached this level. Apart from the South East, London is the only region which has already met the government's 2011 target of 53% of pupils attaining the GCSE benchmark. Indeed, London's state school pupils have outperformed the national average in GCSE performance every year since 2005. In 2009, they were well ahead of the national average (50.7%) of pupils getting five A* to Cs, including maths and English. And of the 247 secondary schools in England which are failing to get over 30% of pupils reaching the GCSE benchmark, just 13 are in London. Why?The improvements could be put down in part to the London Challenge - now rolled out across England as the National Challenge - which was launched in 2003. PUPILS MEETING GCSE BENCHMARK BY REGION
London 54%
South East 53.7%
East of England 51.9%
South West 51.8%
East Midlands 49.9%
North West 49.9%
West Midlands 48.5%
North East 48.1%
Yorkshire and Humber 47.3%
The school improvement programme offers extra support to struggling schools, particularly in maths and English, and to low-performing boroughs. But, while the government would put the improved London performance down to this improvement scheme, it could also be a question of demographics. Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics, says much of the success of London schools in recent years can be explained by high levels of immigration in the capital. "Migrants tend to be aspirational and hardworking and their children are often driven to do well in the country in which they arrive," he says. "Migrants have often made an extraordinary effort to move here and are likely to be people who wish and expect to do well, so it would be surprising if their children didn't do well. "Vietnamese, Chinese and Indian children, to name but three groups, tend to do extremely well in exams." Graduate cityThere is also the impact of middle class families either opting or being forced to stay in the capital. Mr Travers says there is recent evidence of an "enormous slowdown" in property selling and buying, particularly with the recession biting. London is a city of changing demographics "So if the affluent middle-classes have traditionally moved out - to Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Essex - around the time their children start secondary school, then there is some slowdown in that moving out process," he says. A study published by the University and College Union in October suggests London has become a magnet for graduate workers, who may be more likely to encourage their children to do well at school. The UCU research found that 17 of the 25 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales with the highest numbers of graduates were in London. For example, in Hackney North and Stoke Newington and in Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush, 50% of the population has a degree, making these two constituencies better educated than more affluent areas such as Winchester and Bath. Hackney improvesBut whatever the reasons for the improved attainment, the league table data paints a comforting picture for families in London. Of the 10 most improved local authorities for GCSE performance from 1998 to 2009, nine were London boroughs. At the top of the tree, Kensington and Chelsea has improved by 36.6 percentage points since 1998, Hackney by 35.3 percentage points and Lambeth by 33.8. And of the 10 most improved local authorities in the past year, Hackney was top with a 9.6 percentage points improvement on 2008 in 2009. Hammersmith and Fulham was the third most improved local education authority on 2008, with an 8.5 percentage points improvement.

Cambridge Strawberry Fair cancelled over police concern
15,000 people were expected at the festival on Midsummer Common
Organisers of the Cambridge Strawberry Fair have cancelled this year's event after police challenged the granting of a licence by the city council.They said the effort needed to ensure an alcohol licence for the event would take up too much volunteers' time. Cambridgeshire Police made the appeal to question "the legal position in the licensing magistrates' court". Cambridge MP David Howarth said: "It should be left to elected councillors not unelected police." The organising committee said in a statement: "In view of the continuing hostility of the police towards Strawberry Fair the organisers have reluctantly taken the decision to cancel this year's event." Seventy three arrestsJustin Argent, Chairman of Strawberry Fair, said: "The police appeal of the decision made by Cambridge City Council means that we now have to put all our efforts into fighting that appeal, rather than into the detailed preparations for the 2010 fair." Ch Supt Rob Needle said: "We are surprised that the Strawberry Fair organisers have decided to cancel this year's event. "Let me make it absolutely clear once again that we are not against the event in principle, and never have been. "Last year, however, there were 73 arrests, 244 people were given formal warnings for cannabis possession and eight were given penalty notices for urinating in public. "In total there were more than 400 prosecutions. This raises issues under the Licensing Act of 2003 and therefore we made an appeal for further consideration of the legal position by the licensing magistrates' court." The fair ran more smoothly last year thanks to the hard work of the Strawberry Committee, council, police and local residents. We hoped to build on those arrangements this year
Julie Smith, Cambridge City Council
The Strawberry Fair in Cambridge was given the go-ahead by Cambridge City Council despite complaints about drug and alcohol abuse last year. Cambridge MP David Howarth said: "I am extremely saddened by this news. "This is not an issue on which the police should have been allowed to dictate. "It should be left to democratically elected councillors to make decisions like these that affect our city, not unelected police officers." Julie Smith, councillor for arts and recreation, said: "Strawberry Fair makes an extremely valuable cultural contribution to Cambridge. 'Listened carefully'"The fair ran more smoothly last year thanks to the hard work of the Strawberry Committee, council, police and local residents. We hoped to build on those arrangements this year." Jennifer Liddle, who chairs the council's licensing committee, said: "The committee listened very carefully to all of the evidence presented to it, by the police and by the Strawberry Fair committee. "They unanimously decided that the new look Strawberry Fair should be granted a licence. "We believed the conditions we imposed on the licence would address issues such as anti-social behaviour and allow people of all ages to enjoy this event once again."

Last Sea Harriers' flight at base
The jets will fly past in an arrow formation
The Royal Navy's five remaining Sea Harrier Jump Jets are due to arrive at RAF Shawbury on their final flight. The jets played an important role in the Falklands conflict 24 years ago and also served in the first Gulf War, the Balkans and in Sierra Leone. The last five jets from 801 Squadron are being de-commissioned and will be stored at the Shrewsbury air base until they are disposed of.
They will stage a fly past before landing at the base on Wednesday.

The early ducklings
Updated 06 November 2001, 18.02
Newquay Zoo in Cornwall has had an early but unexpected Christmas present - seven newborn ducklings!
Ducklings, like lambs and chicks, aren't usually born until spring when it's warmer.
Warm weather
But because of the recent warm weather and the zoo's cosy lakes, the parents who are wild mallard ducks, decided it was time to hatch their babies.
Fact File
Mallard ducks
Female mallards are "hens"
Male mallards are "drakes"
Average female lays 9 eggs
Only males have green necks
Eggs incubate for 28 days
The ducklings haven't been named yet and have been moved to a village farm where they'll get shelter and vitamins to help them through the cold winter weather.
Mike Thomas, managing director of the zoo said: "Eventually they will grow up and fly off, but for now this is their home and they are in the best place."

Scottish Liberal Democrat Manifesto 1999
Back to BBC News Online Front Page
Back to Scotland '99 Home Page
Scotland's education
Key pledges
Recruit 2000 extra teachers
Double spending on school books and equipment in the first year
Launch a "Schools 2010" capital investment programme to tackle substandard school buildings and temporary classrooms
Abolish tuition fees for all Scottish students
Provide high quality early years' education for all three and four year olds whose parents want it
Quadruple student access funds to �14million to help the poorest students get to university
The challenge
Education is the key to Scotland's future
Without high quality education, Scotland will not be able to compete in a world economy, which depends more and more on knowledge and skills. Liberal Democrats want a society in which there is opportunity for everybody to develop their talents to the full throughout their lives. But if we are to succeed in restoring our education system to world class levels, we must recognise how much there is to do.
Too many Scottish schoolchildren have to learn in cramped and crumbling classrooms from tatty, outdated textbooks which they have to share with others. They do not have the facilities which they deserve for science, computing or sport. Worst of all, they do not have enough teachers, and those they do have are undervalued.
Under successive governments, Scotland's education has been underfunded, and undermined by a bewildering succession of reforms and contradictory shifts in policy. With a new Parliament, it is time for a fresh start. Liberal Democrats want Scotland's education system to be among the best in the world. Furthermore, we are honest enough to admit that we cannot achieve our aims without raising and spending more money.
In making education our first priority, we are determined to tackle the problems which have held Scotland's teachers and schools back for so long. These include:
successive cuts, which have deprived schools of vital books, equipment and teachers;
a torrent of initiatives and instructions from central government, which has left schools drowning in bureaucracy;
constant denigration of teachers by ministers and the media;
pay rates in education falling behind comparable jobs;
schools in more deprived communities ill-equipped to help children cope with social problems.
Our priorities
It will take time to achieve all our ambitions for Scottish education. We propose three key measures which will nonetheless make a huge difference.
We will:
Recruit 2000 extra teachers and more support
staff. This will enable us to cut class sizes and improve the pupil/teacher ratio particularly in primary schools. We shall ensure the extra teachers give priority to making the greatest impact on literacy and numeracy.
Launch a "Schools 2010" capital investment programme. We will provide at least an extra �100 million over the four years of the Parliament for capital investment in schools as a significant step towards tackling the problem of sub-standard buildings by 2010. This will include replacing hundreds of temporary classrooms which have become far too permanent a feature of our schools. We will require all Councils to carry out a building audit of all schools to identify necessary work, including security, disabled access and energy efficiency, over the period of the Parliament.
Double the spending on books and equipment in the first full budget year of the Parliament. We will also maintain increased spending levels thereafter.
Our ambitions for education
Making the right start
The first years of school are the most important of all. The only way to ensure genuine equality of opportunity for all Scotland's children is to guarantee high quality education for infants throughout the country.
We will:
Continue the planned expansion of pre-school provision and concentrate resources on early years' education to improve literacy and numeracy.
Provide high quality early years' education for all three and four year olds whose parents want it.
Higher standards in schools
Liberal Democrats believe that the more diversity there is in Scotland's schools, the more their overall quality will improve. Raising standards in education does not mean imposing a rigid uniform system of teaching from the centre.
We will:
Set and achieve ambitious targets for literacy and numeracy, as determined by our Commission on Education.
Increase substantially the supply of specialist music, drama and modern language teachers. We shall also use some of the additional teaching posts to increase the supply of science and maths teachers in secondary schools.
Ensure that all Scottish school children meet a high minimum standard of computer skills. All schools should be able to make full use of the new technologies, particularly in rural areas.
Support children with special needs. We will improve the arrangements for diagnosis and support for children with special needs and give every local authority a separate Special Educational Needs allocation.
Boost investment for new school buildings.
Strengthen discipline in schools. Recognising the growing problem of classroom indiscipline and that even one disruptive pupil can affect the teaching of an entire class, we will support teachers in maintaining discipline and provide them with the means to do so, for example through special training. We will also continue to support the initiatives on alternatives to exclusion. We will require every school to develop policies to tackly bullying and truancy.
Strengthen the teaching of Scottish history and culture in our schools.
Guarantee teaching and Gaelic and of Gaelic as a second language where there is a demand.
Encourage diversity. Allow schools to develop their own style and strengths, for example in science and technology, sport or arts. This would widen parent and pupil choice. We will encourage independent schools to work with state schools through local partnership schemes.
Establish a dialogue with the churches about their role. Recognise the valuable role of the churches in education and establish a dialogue with all the major faiths about the role they wish to play in education over the coming decades.
Valuing teachers
Teacher morale in Scotland has suffered enormously under successive governments over the last twenty years. In other countries teachers are highly regarded, well-paid professionals. The success of the new Scotland will depend heavily on the quality of its teachers.
We will:
Ensure that pay rates and promotion prospects allow teaching to compete for the best people with other careers.
Review the role and practice of the General Teaching Council. We want the GTC to help to maintain high professional standards throughout a teacher's career. We will provide more opportunities and reward for continuous professional development.
Regular seek teachers' views. We will commission genuinely independent research to check on the standards being achieved.
Relieve teachers of their burden of paperwork. We will provide enough administrative staff and IT support in schools, releasing the time of teachers for actual teaching.
Sport and physical education
There are too few Scots who are as fit as they should be. Sport and fitness, particularly for the young, are an important way of developing the full potential of our people, creating more worthwhile leisure activities for young people, reducing social alienation and promoting good healthy lifestyles.
We will:
Endorse and support a national strategy for Scottish Sport based on Sport 21.
Maximise the time allocated for sport and physical education in schools. We will identify where facilities are inadequate.
Create a fund to enable good voluntary organisation projects to continue after lottery or other time-limited grants have expired.
Community education
Further Education should be open to all, whether it is part-time or full-time.
We will:
Open up schools to the whole community. We will encourage an integrated approach to wider community use of schools and other facilities. We will encourage more voluntary after-school, holiday and supported study schemes. Schools, not least in rural areas, should become centres of education networks, accessible to every age group.
Guarantee an out of school hours "extra curricular" activity for every secondary pupil in Scotland - by working in partnership with teachers, sport and drama professionals, voluntary organisations and others.
Higher and further education opportunities
Scotland's economic future will depend on its ability to sustain a highly skilled and flexible workforce. The new Scotland needs to build on its proud traditions in university education and develop a system in which lifelong learning is available to all.
We will:
Widen access to further and higher education.
Attack student poverty. We will quadruple, to around �14million per year, the access funds administered by universities and colleges to tackle financial hardship. Funding would be targeted, allowing maintenance of up to �2,000 a year to be paid to mature students and those in greatest financial difficulty.
Abolish tuition fees for all Scottish students at UK universities.
Abolish 4th year tuition fees for English, Welsh and Northern Irish students at Scottish universities. We will work at Westminster for the abolition of university tuition fees across the UK. We oppose the concept of top-up fees for undergraduates in higher and further education.
Support the progress of the University of the Highlands and Islands towards full university status.
Support high quality university research. We will provide the strongest possible support for the research base in our universities to maintain their competitive position at UK and international levels.
Reform and improve the financial support of colleges of further education. We will enhance the key role played by colleges in education and training, particularly for technological and industrial careers. We will work to improve their funding and create, along with them, a modern, prestigious apprenticeship system combining on-the-job training and study.
Use the colleges and the voluntary sector to spearhead the provision of quality adult and youth education and training. We will encourage the development of a regional strategic frame-work for further education across Scotland, the use of more New Deal funding in this field and the streamlining of quality audit arrangements.
Support disadvantaged students at college and university. We will allocate additional resources to fund the institutions which recruit such students, in recognition of the added costs of recruiting and supporting disadvantaged students with few qualifications.
Support an independent UK Pay Review Body for higher and further education. We will aim to implement its awards in full without staging. We will require a vote of the Scottish Parliament to overturn such recommendations.
Planning to be World Class
In the past, too many Governments have tinkered around with the structures of education. They usually succeeded only in increasing the bureaucracy and demoralising the teaching profession. Liberal Democrats believe that the structure of Scotland's education system does not require yet more fundamental change. At the same time there are steps which could be taken to make the administration more efficient and accountable.
We will:
Establish a standing commission on education.
We will give top priority to a thorough stock-taking of Scottish education, involving the specialist Parliamentary committees, to draw on expert opinion and experience here and in other countries. The Commission would be expected to genuinely consult all the interested parties across Scottish civic life, not least teachers, building a coalition for agreed reform. All the evidence gathered would be used to evaluate the merits of recently introduced reforms as well as to draw up a 10-year programme of coherent reforms to restore Scottish education to its prime position.
Aim to enhance civic and environmental education.
We will include the basic concepts of business and enterprise.
Establish a powerful Department of Education and Enterprise. The Department will be overseen by a Parliamentary Select Committee on Education.
Avoid over-hasty and unwanted initiatives. We will not make further major reforms in the curriculum and exam system without adequate resources and full consultation with staff.
