Obituary: Pope John Paul II
John Paul II transformed the papacy
Karol Wojtyla's election as Pope in 1978 stunned the Catholic world.
Not one expert had tipped the 58-year-old bishop of Krakow for the top job. His stand against Poland's Communist regime had brought him respect. But he was not part of the Vatican "in-crowd" and, above all, he was the first non-Italian pope in more than 450 years. He went on to become one of the most familiar faces in the world. His papal odyssey covered more than 120 countries and he earned himself the reputation of an international fighter for freedom.
But, to his critics, John Paul II was the arch-conservative - an autocrat whose pronouncements on abortion, contraception and women's rights have had an effect on millions of lives.
Theologian in hiding The youngest pope of the 20th Century was born near Krakow, Poland, in 1920. As a young man he excelled at sports, including soccer and skiing. He also had a great love for the theatre and, at one time, seriously considered becoming an actor. Archbishop of Krakow
World War II and the Nazi occupation saw Karol Wojtyla working as a labourer. He studied theology from 1942 and was forced into hiding in 1944 following a crackdown on religious teaching.
Continuing his studies after the war, he was ordained a priest in 1946. Rapid promotion followed and by 1964 he was archbishop of the city. Three years later he was a cardinal.
Throughout, he had continued his theological studies and was often seen in Rome, but no more than dozens of other cardinals from distant and obscure dioceses.
Approachable
"The Year of the Three Popes" came in 1978. Pope Paul VI died at the age of 80. His successor, elected in a single day, took the name John Paul in memory of his two predecessors. Thirty-three days later he, too, was dead.
The Pope as a boy
Once again the College of Cardinals conducted the centuries-old ritual of a papal election in the Sistine Chapel. After two days of deliberation, Karol Wojtyla became the next successor to St Peter.
Taking the name John Paul II, the new pontiff signalled a new era in Catholic affairs. He was dynamic and approachable, an instantly recognisable leader for the world's largest Christian community. Above all, he travelled. On an early trip to Ireland, he appealed to the men of violence to return to the ways of peace. American Catholics saw him reject all calls for a change in moral teaching.
Ecumenical services
But his insistence on getting close to crowds almost led to his death in May 1981. Leaning out of his vehicle in St Peter's Square, he was shot and seriously wounded by a Turkish fanatic. After a long recovery, he visited and forgave his would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca.
The Pope moments after being shot In 1982 he visited Britain. This was a historically charged trip made all the more important as it occurred during the Falklands crisis. The Pope appealed for a peaceful end to the Falklands issue, a plea which was mirrored in a visit to Argentina days later. He participated in a number of ecumenical services with the Church of England, something unthinkable in previous eras.
Huge crowds, Catholic and Protestant, attended his every move and the talk was of union between Rome and Canterbury - a union which today seems as far away as ever, because of the issue of women priests. Influential in eastern bloc
With the break-up of the Soviet bloc, relations between the Kremlin and the Vatican gained a new significance. In 1989, Mikhail Gorbachev visited Rome, the first time a Soviet leader had crossed the threshold of St Peter's.
With Archbishop Robert Runcie in Canterbury, 1982
"The Pope," he told his wife Raisa at the time, "is the pre-eminent moral authority in the world. But he's still a Slav." The understanding between the two men undoubtedly eased the way to democracy in the eastern bloc.
The collapse of Communism coincided with increasing demands in the West for a compromise on religious teaching. By consistently rejecting these calls, John Paul effectively closed the debate before it had started. He was a complex man. While calling for action to combat world poverty, he insisted that contraception was morally unacceptable. He said that he wanted to improve the status of women while writing that motherhood should be a woman's natural aspiration.
Reign saw great change
He frequently criticised the liberalism which he saw all around him. Homosexuals incurred both his wrath and his pity, to the dismay of campaigners for gay rights.
Although dogged by ill-health in later years, the journeys continued - to Cuba, Nigeria, former Yugoslav republics and the Holy Land, each with its own particular set of pastoral and political problems.
A frail Pontiff
In 2002, the Pope made an emotional and nostalgic final visit to his homeland, flying over his birthplace in Wadowice and visiting the graves of his parents and brother in Krakow.
Once again, vast crowds turned out to see the man many Poles regarded as a living saint and who had, they believed, played a key role in liberating them from Communism.
John Paul's reign also saw other radical changes throughout the world - including the emergence of Aids. And he had to deal with an increasing number of sex abuse scandals which have recently beset the Catholic Church.
Throughout his reign, his work to maintain the dignity of mankind against what he saw as the dangers of modern life, together with his personal magnetism, made Pope John Paul II one of the most remarkable men of his times.

Russians lost in mushroom heaven
St Petersburg is having its best mushroom year for half a century
A bumper mushroom crop in Russia this year has pleased everyone except officials of the Emergencies Ministry in St Petersburg.
They are the ones that have to go looking for mushroom hunters who get lost in the forests near the city - a total of 121 people since 1 August.
Most missing mushroomers are found within 24 to 48 hours, although the ministry says 11 are currently unaccounted for.
"People are people, so we have to look for them come what may," said Yuri Yushin, spokesman for the Emergency Ministry's northwestern branch.
But he and others in the ministry complain that their resources could more usefully be spent dealing with forest fires and other genuine emergencies.
'Make a cup of tea'
St Petersburg is surrounded by sparsely populated marshland and forest, ideal country for mushroom hunting but also easy to get lost in.
The pull of the forest is even greater this year, because of the size of the crop - reportedly the best in the region for half a century.
FAVOURITE RUSSIAN MUSHROOMS
Bely or Borovik (Penny bun boletus)
Opiata (honey mushroom)
Podberyozovik (Rough birch stock)
Masliak (Slippery jack)
Ryzhik (Saffron milk cap)
The discovery of hallucinogenic mushrooms in the area in recent years raises the possibility that some lost people may not just have taken a wrong turning.
The newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, reporting the disappearances, had some advice for potential mushroomers.
It said people should be aware of which direction they were travelling in, but if lost they should keep calm, build a fire and make some tea.
People could generally live for as long as a week in the forest without any great risk to their health, the article said.
National pastime
Mushroom-picking is a national pastime in Russia, with thousands of people going out into the woods every summer and autumn to gather.
Mostly mushrooms are appreciated as a nourishing pickled or fried dish or as a base for healthy soup. But in recent years Psylocybe, or magic, mushrooms have been discovered outside St Petersburg.
Occasionally, people mistakenly eat poisonous toadstools.
Moscow health officials quoted by the Associated Press news agency say 34 people have died from eating fungi this year.
A total of 457 cases of poisoning have been reported throughout the country.

PLO demands end to armed attacks
Attacks cannot be allowed to continue, Sharon says
The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has called for an end to attacks by militant groups against Israel.
In its strongest such appeal since the death of Yasser Arafat, the PLO's top body "demanded halting all military acts that harm our national interests".
The call came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon gave his troops free rein to crack down on militants.
Tensions have soared since Palestinian suicide bombers killed six Israelis at a Gaza Strip crossing late on Thursday.
In continuing violence, an Israeli tank shell killed a Palestinian woman and her son in Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian medics and witnesses said.
This follows the deaths on Saturday of eight Palestinians killed by Israeli troops during incursions into Gaza. Two Israelis, including a seven-year-old, were also injured by Palestinian rockets. Dialogue
In a statement, the PLO's decision-making executive committee said it gave its "full support to Abu Mazen's [Mahmoud Abbas] inauguration speech to stop all military acts that harm our national interest".
These instructions will remain valid as long as the Palestinians fail to lift even a single finger

Egypt calls for dialogue
Mr Abbas - who was elected Palestinian president last Sunday and has also succeeded Arafat as PLO chairman - called for an end to violence on both sides and urged a resumption of peace negotiations with Israel.
He has said he will not use force against militants but try to persuade them to call a ceasefire.
The PLO embraces most Palestinian groups bar the Islamists.
Israel severed ties with the Palestinians following Thursday's truck bombing and gun attack at a Gaza-Israel crossing point.
Meanwhile Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak called on the Israeli leader to resume contacts with Mr Abbas.
Free hand
On Sunday, the Israeli prime minister said he has given his troops a free hand to launch a crackdown on Palestinian militants.
"Despite the change in Palestinian leadership, we have yet to see them taking any action against terror," Ariel Sharon told his cabinet.
At the same time that Abu Mazen says he will work hard to return to the peace track, Sharon declares a military escalation

Press mulls Abbas future
"The Israeli military and security apparatus have been instructed to take any action needed without restriction," Mr Sharon said on Sunday.
"These instructions will remain valid as long as the Palestinians fail to lift even a single finger."
Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath condemned the announcement.
"At the same time that Abu Mazen says he will work hard to return to the peace track, Sharon declares a military escalation," he said, using the Palestinian leader's nickname.
Palestinian officials said Mr Abbas will visit the Gaza Strip this week in an effort to convince militant groups to stop attacks against Israeli targets.
But the BBC's James Reynolds in Jerusalem says Mr Sharon's latest move may complicate Mr Abbas' tactic of trying to reach a ceasefire through negotiation and persuasion.
Militant factions have indicated they will only stop attacks if Israel does the same.
Mr Sharon's comments to his cabinet suggest that that is unlikely to happen, our correspondent says.

Good progress in Iraq war
General Richard Myers
Breakfast With Frost Interview with General Richard Myers, Chairman, Joint Chiefs Of Staff, Sunday 30 March 2003
Please note "BBC Breakfast with Frost" must be credited if any part of this transcript is used
DAVID FROST: The political and military leaders of the campaign in Iraq insist, as we have heard a lot, that it's going according to plan, despite the criticism of their war strategy and the fears that the coalition forces are getting bogged down. Now one of the key architects of that operation is the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, American's most senior general, Richard Myers, in the role that Colin Powell had in the previous Gulf War. I spoke to General Myers earlier - the first interview he's done for any British media since the war started - and I began by asking about yesterday's suicide attack on American soldiers, it's yet another hazard for the allied troops to deal with. GENERAL MYERS: Well it's not a technique, I don't think that's unknown. Clearly British troops are familiar with that, with what they've been dealing with in the last couple of decades in various parts of the world, we're familiar with that. I think we can adjust our tactics and our techniques and the procedures we use to overcome that threat. It's just a reminder that there are some very desperate people out there and we've got to be on our toes. DAVID FROST: If you had to summarise the overall position after ten days, what would you say? Some good progress but not going entirely according to plan? GENERAL MYERS: Sir David what I would say is, first of all, no plan no matter how good, how brilliant, survives the first contact with the enemy - that's an old adage in military planning and it's true today just as it has been in the past. I would say, if you look at it from the strategic level of military, the strategic military level, that the things that pop out to me are, one is the plan has prevented so far from any Scuds being fired into neighbouring countries, Jordan and Israel; that the majority of the southern oil fields are under coalition control so that we didn't experience the environmental disaster that was certainly possible; that there's has been no mass humanitarian refugee, refugee flow, let me say, no humanitarian crisis at this point and we're postured to provide humanitarian aid and medical aid where it's needed. DAVID FROST: We've all heard that remark by the senior US army commander in Iraq, Lt. General William Wallace, who said "The army we're fighting is different from the one we'd war-gamed against." The Iraqis are fighting better than anticipated, aren't they? GENERAL MYERS: Certainly the tenacity, the audacity, the ferociousness of the, what we're calling the regime death squads, has been, has had, in terms of an overall strategic military impact, not much of an impact, certainly it's been harassment that has to be dealt with and is being dealt with very effectively by US and British forces. In fact, if I can just divert just a minute and talk about the way the British forces are handling the situation in Basra, I think it's been absolutely magnificent, the way they've worked that situation. Here you have people that are, you know, their very, their very fabric of their existence is dominated by the fact that they've been exploited and tortured and brutalised by this regime and they're afraid to come forward right now and the way the British troops are working with them and our special forces to eradicate the Ba'ath Party personnel that still hold guns to their heads, the, these death squads that are in fact executing people if they don't support the regime, the way that's been handled in the Basra area is absolutely magnificent. DAVID FROST: It's clear from the briefings we've had in the last day or so, that the American and British publics have got to be prepared for this war now to last months rather than weeks. GENERAL MYERS: Sir David, I'm not going to make a prediction in terms of how long the, this conflict will last. Certainly it's got to last long enough to disarm Iraq and I think everybody agrees with that, including, at least to some degree, the UN when they issued of course 1441, and also to remove the regime that oppresses its people. So it's going to be event-oriented. I don't know how long it's going to last. I've always said that the toughest part is yet to come, that it will not be linear in terms of how tough the fight is, so I would think the toughest fighting is ahead of us. Y
you never know, regimes like this, that have their power base in fear and intimidation, tend to topple fairly quickly when it's pretty apparent that they're no longer going to be around. And I can assure people that the end of this, the result, the conclusion, is never going to be in doubt. The Iraqi regime will be out of power, we will disarm them from their weapons of mass destruction and I, I think you just can't predict when it, or when the regime will tip. DAVID FROST: Everyone expects the toughest fighting of all to be in Baghdad. If it comes to urban warfare, how does the coalition make it's technical superiority tell? GENERAL MYERS: I can assure you that US forces have leaned heavily on our UK counterparts who have a lot of experience in this area and I just, I just don't think I can get into the operational pieces of it. We're going to bring everything to bear there. The one thing that we have on our side and that we're already using, and that is patience. With the outcome never in doubt, we can afford to take our time and set the conditions on the battlefield, wherever that battlefield is. The Republican Guard divisions now arrayed south of Baghdad or whatever those conditions are in Baghdad proper, we're going to be able to take the time we need to set the conditions so that we do a couple of things - we spare Iraqi civilians from harm, and of course that's been one of our principles right along, and second that we don't put the England's, or the United States, our blood and treasure, our men and women, in harm's way in an unnecessary way. DAVID FROST: It's been said by some that because of the need to win Iraqi hearts and minds that you're having to fight this war with one hand tied behind your back, as it were. That if you could go at it with full strength you could finish it much quicker - no more Mr nice guy. Do your men feel that? GENERAL MYERS: I think it's inherent upon great powers to exercise restraint. Clearly we're trying to follow the laws of armed conflict, clearly we're trying to follow the Geneva convention. There may be things we could do - I doubt it - that hasten the end, but we've got to be very, very careful. We've said from the outset, this is not a war against the Iraqi people, in fact it's just the opposite, it's the liberation of the Iraqi people. We don't want to occupy Iraq. We have the moral upper hand here and that's how we keep the moral upper hand. And as long as we can be patient and not put our people in harm's way, unnecessarily, then I think we're on the right track. DAVID FROST: Why haven't the predictions of mass surrender by the Iraqi army and civilians coming out to welcome the liberators with garlands of flowers - why haven't these predictions come true? GENERAL MYERS: Until they are absolutely certain that there is no hope for this regime to survive, I think they're going to be very cautious. I certainly would, would be very cautious as well. And it's going to, it will probably take a little bit more time before, to them, they see that the end is purely in sight for that regime. It's clear to me now, and I think it's clear to our military force and it's certainly clear from what the Prime Minister has said and what our President has said, that the outcome is not in doubt. That victory is certain, that this regime, we will not stop until this regime is removed from power and until we get control of those weapons of mass destruction and deal with them appropriately. But it maybe some time before some of the people that have been so abused by this regime believe that. DAVID FROST: Something which I know is particularly upsetting for people in the military are these friendly fire incidents. Can any more be done to prevent them? Or are they an inevitable part of war? GENERAL MYERS: I hope it's not an inevitable part of war. It's the absolute saddest tragedy that any of us can experience and I regret the lives of the crew of the Tornado that was engaged by the Patriot system and I think we've had another friendly fire incident since then and there's, there's simply no excuse for that. We clearly have clinical means to prevent that, we have techniques, procedures and tactics to help prevent that. I suppose in the, in the middle of war which is a, by nature, a very chaotic event and at certain times on the battlefield, that those things happen. But I don't, I don't ever accept that they're inevitable and I don't think we should ever stop trying to find means to prevent that from happening. And certainly my heart and the hearts of our joint chiefs of staff go out to those in the British forces who have been harmed in this way. DAVID FROST: You talked about patience being a vital quality for the military. Do you think the American and British public have the patience to see it through? GENERAL MYERS: First of all, let me start by saying how much we in the military appreciate having our closest ally with us in this endeavour. I can't tell you what a difference that makes and it makes a difference on the battlefield, it makes a difference when we're planning, I think it makes a difference every time I go to bed at night knowing that we have a stanch ally like Britain, solidly with us in this and sharing the risk and trying to do what's right for not only the region but the world in terms of weapons of mass destruction falling, falling in terrorist hands.
I think, I can't speak for the British people because I just, just not quite as knowledgeable about what's being said over there, but I can tell you I think in American people's minds, I think they, they will want us to be patient. That's what a great power does, they would want their military commander to operate with deliberateness, to be careful, to try to prevent civilian casualties and to take on the enemy when we're ready to take on the enemy. And I don't, I don't think it could be much different there where you are, but it might be. DAVID FROST: General Myers, we thank you very much. GENERAL MYERS: Sir David, could I just mention one other thing. I'd just like to reiterate my deepest sympathy for the families involved of those who have been lost in this conflict so far. We honour their bravery and their courage and particularly great sadness for those that have been killed by friendly fire, in this case United States friendly fire. I don't think we have to live with situations like that and one of my jobs has to be to ensure that we get the resources and the technical means to ensure that in the future this never happens again. And that will be, that will be my quest. And again, thank you Sir David. DAVID FROST: And our thanks to the general there. INTERVIEW ENDS E-mail this to a friend

Queen 'welcome at D-Day service'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The PM says he would "make it possible" for the Queen to attend if she wished
Gordon Brown has said he will arrange for the Queen to attend next Saturday's D-Day events in France if she wants to.The prime minister told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme if any royal wants to be at the commemorations on 6 June he would "make that possible". Buckingham Palace has said there would be no royal presence because no-one was invited, but denied claims of a snub. Mr Brown will represent the UK at the event in Normandy, to mark those who died storming the beaches 65 years ago. 'Disgrace'Downing Street reportedly only decided to attend the event once it was pointed out the anniversary would be the last time many veterans would be able to travel. The Conservatives have criticised the government for failing to secure a royal invitation from their French counterparts - protocol means they cannot invite themselves. Tory leader David Cameron told BBC One's Politics Show he did not want to involve the Queen in politics but went on to say it was a "complete mess". "To start with they didn't recognise the importance of the 65th anniversary of D-Day," he said. "So they have been too slow off the mark in planning what is an appropriate commemoration of what was one of the most important days in the history of Western Europe." Tory MP for Romford Andrew Rosindell told the Sunday Express: "It is shocking and disgraceful that the Queen, who is not only head of state but also head of the British Army, has not been invited to France for such an important event." When asked whether it was a "disgrace" the Queen would not be there, Mr Brown said he had simply fulfilled his duty as the prime minister by accepting French president Nicolas Sarkozy's personal invitation.
We have never expressed any sense of anger or frustration at all, and are content with all the arrangements that are planned
Buckingham Palace
The event was intended for prime ministers and presidents rather than royals, Mr Brown added. "But if the queen wanted to attend these events or if any member of the royal family wanted to attend these events, I would make that possible," he said. US President Barack Obama will join Mr Sarkozy for commemorations at the American Cemetery in Normandy. French officials said the Queen was welcome and the UK government was responsible for deciding who should attend what was "primarily a Franco-American ceremony". Hundreds of British veterans will hold their main memorial event at the Arromanches landing beaches, where thousands of troops poured ashore on 6 June 1944, and during the following days. The French government has denied snubbing the Queen
A Royal British Legion Service of Remembrance, at Bayeux Cathedral, will also be held. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "Neither the Queen nor any other members of the royal family will be attending the D-Day commemorations on June 6 as we have not received an official invitation to any of these events. "We would like to reiterate that we have never expressed any sense of anger or frustration at all, and are content with all the arrangements that are planned." The Normandy landings saw thousands of Allied troops pour on to the beaches of occupied France and marked a strategic turning point in the war against Nazi Germany. For the 60th anniversary of the invasion in 2004, the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales all attended commemoration events in France. Are you a veteran of the D-Day landings?

Education secretary warning to incompetent teachers
By Seonag Mackinnon
BBC Scotland Education Correspondent
The education secretary has said some teachers may have to leave the profession because they are not up to the job.Mike Russell was responding to concerns about the requirement, under the new curriculum for excellence, for staff to develop more lessons for themselves and make less use of text books and worksheets.
Staff are being encouraged to develop more lessons themselves
Mr Russell said: "At the end of the day, there are some people who will not make it and we need to be quite clear these are people who should not be in our classrooms." Rejecting any suggestion that poor skills were widespread, Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said later: "It's never been easier to sack a teacher." He added: "The competence of teachers is 'umbilically' connected to the level of resources and continuous professional development (training)." Speaking at a meeting of the parliament's education committee, Mr Russell said the curriculum had evolved from the existing one but indicated it would be challenging. "It is actually in world terms a rather revolutionary approach," he said.
I've been put into classrooms by head teachers who have known the teacher they're showing me is not up to standard
Margaret SmithLiberal Democrats
He added "I have an absolute commitment to the highest standards of teaching in Scotland and I want to see that constantly in place. "And if despite help, despite support, all the things that we should do as good employers, yes there is a reality that some people should be doing something else. " Margaret Smith, the Liberal Democrat's education spokeswoman, said head teachers were worried that a minority of staff would struggle to adapt. "It's absolutely crucial for this curriculum to work that we have good teachers," she said. "I've been put into classrooms by head teachers who have known the teacher they're showing me is not up to standard. "Head teachers have a real difficulty with this." 'Ill-defined'Mr Russell said local authorities had been reluctant to take action in the past about teachers whose talents probably lie outside the profession. Last year, for the first time, the General Teaching Council of Scotland barred a teacher on the grounds of competence. The education secretary said lesson plans, resources and training courses were in the pipeline but said ultimately they might not be enough. Responding to teachers' complaints that the new curriculum was ill-defined and that schools were ill-prepared, the education secretary said sample lessons were being distributed and in-service courses set up to provide help for teachers seeking to upgrade their skills. Ronnie Smith, of the EIS, said head teachers needed to act if a teacher was letting down pupils. "What on earth are they doing if they don't take action?, he said. "It could be seen as a dereliction of duty if they acquiesce in allowing these people to still teach in our schools."

Chelsea 2-1 Everton
By Paul Fletcher
Lescott's own goal was a cruel blow for Everton after they had equalised
Everton defender Joleon Lescott scored an injury-time own goal to hand Chelsea the advantage after the first leg of their Carling Cup semi-final.
Lescott headed the ball into his own net as Shaun Wright-Phillips closed in.
The Chelsea winger had opened the scoring with a curling strike before Jon Mikel Obi was dismissed following a sliding tackle on Phil Neville.
Yakubu then equalised with a brilliant shot on the turn while James McFadden hit the post for Everton.
Interview: Chelsea boss Avram Grant
Interview: Everton boss David Moyes
Chelsea were the better team for large phases of the match but, once Yakubu equalised shortly after Mikel's 64th-minute dismissal, Everton looked the team most likely to win a pulsating tie.
And even after Lescott, under pressure from the impressive Wright-Phillips, had put the ball into his own net Everton might have grabbed a second equaliser.
Lescott found himself through on goal and with a chance to almost immediately atone for his error but a heavy touch at a crucial moment saw the ball run away from him and Hilario was able to gather.
606: DEBATE
If Jose was still with us, we would have shut up shop and it would have stayed as a draw
OJ
It was a far cry from the opening half, which Chelsea went on to dominate after Wright-Phillips struck with 25 minutes played.
Lee Carsley allowed Wright-Phillips to drift into the Everton area and the Chelsea winger turned sharply before finishing brilliantly after collecting a pass from Florent Malouda. Everton all too often gave Chelsea too much time and space and Joe Cole almost scored after eluding Phil Jagielka before bursting through on goal.
Cole saw his shot smothered by Tim Howard but referee Peter Walton, having initially played an advantage, awarded Chelsea a free-kick for Jagielka's challenge and Michael Ballack missed by inches with a fizzing strike. Everton looked relieved to reach the break without conceding again but Wright-Phillips was once more gifted far too much space a minute into the second half and forced another save from Howard.
Chelsea seemed intent on trying to establish a decisive first-leg advantage but their attacking ambitions were undermined when Mikel was dismissed for his tackle on Neville.
Shaun-Wright Phillips had a hand in both goals
The Nigerian appeared intent on trying to win the ball but his studs were showing and Walton had no hesitation in dismissing the player.
Despite the sending-off Chelsea still managed to fashion a great opening but Claudio Pizarro, after collecting Wright-Phillips's superb through ball, failed to connect cleanly and within minutes Everton were level.
Yakubu, mostly absent for the first 64 minutes of the tie, brilliantly equalised after Joseph Yobo had hooked McFadden's free-kick back into the danger zone.
McFadden then hit the post from the tightest of angles after a mazy run down the left as Everton suddenly started to dominate.
But Lescott put the ball in his own net after he was caught stationary by Wright-Phillips at the far post.

Profile: Jenson Button
BAR have won their fight with Williams for Jenson Button to drive for them next season.
A contractual dispute about the driver's future was decided in BAR's favour following a ruling by Formula One's Contract Recognition Board (CRB).
Button had signed for Williams citing a loophole in his 2005 BAR contract as a way to return to the team. He said: "Naturally I am disappointed but as a matter of principle I firmly believe in standing by the decision."
But the 24-year-old vowed to return to Williams in the future.
"BAR have been extremely professional at the race track during this process, and I expect this to continue," he said. "I look forward to joining the Williams team in the future."
Williams chief Frank Williams also said he would accept the decision, but suggested he will attempt to sign Button for 2006.
In spite of the CRB's conclusion, which relates to 2005, we will maintain our close relationship with Jenson for 2006

"Naturally we are disappointed with the CRB's conclusion," Williams said.
"We took the view that Jenson was a driver worth challenging for, and based on strong legal advice we have no regrets about making a bid for his services. "The CRB accepted a significant number of the BMW WilliamsF1 Team's arguments, but nevertheless found against us.
"We do not believe any further legal action in relation to this matter to be in the broader interests of the sport.
"In spite of the CRB's conclusion, which relates to 2005, we will maintain our close relationship with Jenson for 2006."
Legal presentations from both teams were heard in Milan on Saturday before the verdict was delivered.
Williams announced the decision from Interlagos where they are preparing for the Brazilian Grand Prix.
The dispute began in August when Williams claimed they had a prior option on Button.
They believed they were able to exercise the option because Honda's commitment to supply engines to BAR was not definitive in a new contract drawn up this summer.

BAR argued that Honda's intent was clear.
BAR boss David Richards, who always insisted he was the only man to have a genuine contract with Button, was overjoyed at the he CRB's decision.
"I'm delighted to confirm that we just received the official
notification that the CRB have ruled in our favour," he said.
Button has inspired BAR to second spot in the Constructors' Championship behind Ferrari while he himself lies in third place in the drivers' standings.
The 24-year-old Somerset-born driver has started to realise his potential this season with some impressive displays.
Brazilian Antonio Pizzonia is now likely to step in at Williams after impressing as a recent stand-in for Ralf Schumacher.
