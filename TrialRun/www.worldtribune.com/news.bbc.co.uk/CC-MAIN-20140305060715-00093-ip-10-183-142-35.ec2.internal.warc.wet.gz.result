Beadle in hospital with pneumonia
Jeremy Beadle became ITV's most popular prankster in the 1980s
Television presenter and prankster Jeremy Beadle is seriously ill in hospital suffering from pneumonia.
He is on a respirator in a north London hospital where his condition is said to be "stable".
The 59-year-old became one of ITV's most popular presenters during the 1980s with hidden camera shows like Game For a Laugh and Beadle's About. "He is being very well cared for and we wish him a full and speedy recovery," said his agent in a statement.
Beadle, who was born in Hackney, east London, had an operation to remove a cancerous kidney in 2004. The following year he was diagnosed with a mild form of leukaemia following a blood test.
Charity
Beadle first found national fame in 1981 with Game for a Laugh, but he is best known for his series Beadle's About, first shown on ITV in 1987, which saw unwitting people fall prey to elaborate set-ups.
The show's host regularly turned up in disguise to spring the surprise on the victim of the plot.
He later became the host of You've Been Framed, which showed mishaps caught on video camera by viewers. The host fell out of favour in the mid-90s, but he has continued to work for charity, raising ï¿½13m for organisations including the Foundation for Children with Leukaemia.
The star was appointed MBE in 2001 for his charity work.

What is your real rate of inflation?
More Or Less
Monday, 21 April, 2008
BBC Radio 4, 1630 BST
Listen to programme
Are we being hoodwinked into thinking that inflation is lower than it really is? British newspapers and supermarkets are starting to publish their own inflation rate checkers and this has got us thinking. The government's headline measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, is 2.5% but Asda supermarket has estimated that for their average shopper the cost of living is rising at over 5%.
More Or Less presenter Tim Harford points out that actually Asda has produced an estimate of how much cash a typical family has left after buying essentials, not a rate of inflation. So the Office for National Statistics is not falling over itself to copy the Asda methodology. Tim chats to economic statistician Michael Ward who points out that the measure of inflation that the prime minister tends to quote - the Consumer Price Index - is much lower than the traditional measure, the Retail Price Index.
Paul Dales at Capital Economics tells us that, in reality, it is an impossible mission to find an exact rate of inflation. So Tim went to the pub instead, with the consolation that you can measure your own personal inflation rate by clicking on the Office of National Statistics website or the Capital Economics website.
Arts and maths
Marcus Du Sautoy on stage during a performance of The 19th Step
Oxford mathematician Marcus Du Sautoy has found himself a Media Fellowship Grant to combine the arts of dance, music and sculpture with - wait for it - mathematics.
More Or Less gets exclusive access to the rehearsal of his latest show, The 19th Step, which is performed in front of Boundstone Community College in Lancing, West Sussex. The responses from pupils and parents are, well, varied. But that is not going to stop Du Sautoy and his bright sartorial elegance. Company valuations
How are companies valued? Revenue? Profits? Growth rate? What about those websites that have millions of free customers, how is their worth valued for example? Company valuations used to be based on tangible measures like price/earnings ratio and capital valuations. But the valuations of hi-tech companies like Facebook and Yahoo greatly exceed these traditional calculations. So where do the billion-dollar price tags come from? Tim Harford asks his colleague at the Financial Times, John Gapper, and blogger and venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky.
Immigration
"Migrant crime wave a myth" (The Guardian)
"Immigrants bring more crime" (Daily Express)
Both these headlines refered to the same story, so has immigration caused a crime wave or not? Our reporter Ruth Alexander tries to find the truth. More or Less asks Richard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College London, and decides that actually neither story is right. There is no statistical evidence to prove either. BBC Radio 4's More or Less will be broadcast on Monday, 21 April, 2008 at 1630 BST.

Glamour or gloom for economy?
By Yvette Shapiro
BBC Northern Ireland business correspondent
Malaysia in April, Washington in June, or Hong Kong in November... all potential destinations for the new economy minister. The opportunities are endless for the new economy minister
Like beauty contestants, candidates for the post must be keen to travel and ready to lead an intrepid band of Northern Ireland exporters on trade missions to new and exciting markets. And there's also ample opportunity to utilise those skills of persuasion and influence, finely-honed during endless hours of political negotiation at St Andrews, Downing Street and Stormont.
Invest Northern Ireland often calls upon the services of the economy minister as it tries to seal the deal with a new foreign investor. The secretary of state recently met senior executives from the US investment bank J P Morgan in New York as part of Invest NI's attempt to secure an inward investment. That's the glamorous side of the job, but it's not without its dangers, as the current Economy Minister Maria Eagle discovered last Autumn. Ms Eagle led a trade mission to Canada, which included a visit to Bombardier in Montreal. She met the chairman and senior directors and posed for photographs. Smiles all round. No smiles, though, a short time later when Bombardier announced that it was cutting more than 600 jobs at the Shorts factory in east Belfast because of falling sales of its regional jets. Northern Ireland has one of the worst rates in the UK for economic inactivity and incapacity benefit levels
Did Ms Eagle know that the axe was due to fall as she enjoyed Bombardier's hospitality the previous week?
Could she have done something to change the company's mind? No, she told the BBC, the company didn't tell her about the planned redundancies. And she said there was nothing she could have done to stop them. Ms Eagle sympathised with those facing unemployment, and pledged that the government would do all it could to support Shorts and its workers in the future. And then she got on with the business of being a direct rule minister with a range of portfolios, including employment and culture. Maria Eagle, of course, doesn't answer to the community in Northern Ireland at election time. Imagine, the pressure for a locally-elected member of the assembly, with no direct rule drawbridge to pull up when circumstances overtake the best of intentions. More, much more, than denials and sympathy would be demanded by constituents, trade unions and workers facing redundancy. Redundancy announcements aside, who wouldn't want to be economy minister right now?
'Many challenges'
House prices are soaring, the retail sector is booming, exports are growing and employment's at an all-time high. But it's not all good news.
Here's a recent economic assessment from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC):
The new minister can make a difference in some areas, but in others he or she will be beholden to the chancellor
"Northern Ireland has the lowest business formation rate in the UK and the highest dependence on both the public sector and on continued high levels of public expenditure. "Over 500,000 people are now economically inactive and some sectors of the economy are in steady decline. "With almost two-thirds of all employees working in the public sector, retail and hospitality, transforming Northern Ireland's public-sector dominated economy into one that is private sector led will require radical initiatives backed by unwavering political and business support."
Still want the job?
Maria Eagle herself admits that there are "many challenges" to be tackled. I asked her what she felt her Stormont successor should get to grips with first. She picked out the skills shortage as a priority for action. Any leading industrialist - particularly the engineers - will tell you that Northern Ireland will be hard pressed to service the future needs of industry unless it can marry what education is providing with what industry needs. To put it bluntly, too many media studies graduates and not enough electronic engineers. There's strong optimism that devolution could help to lever significant levels of foreign investment, but equally strong fears that our pool of manpower will be "fit for purpose". The chairman of the Institute of Directors in Northern Ireland, Frank Bryan, outlines what is required.
"We need a skilled workforce of tomorrow that will meet the needs of the economy," he said.
The Shorts factory in east belfast faces huge job losses
"Crucially, we need the right calibre of careers guidance to assist each child to realise their potential and to have an opportunity to contribute to our economy."
And what of the huge pool of people who are not working, not seeking jobs and not available to work. Some 27% of the local population - 281,000 people of working age - are defined as "economically inactive". More than a quarter of these are classified as long-term sick.
Northern Ireland has one of the worst rates in the UK for economic inactivity and incapacity benefit levels.
Successive government initiatives have tried, and failed, to make a dent in the figures. The new economy minister will not be able to bask in the glow of the headline unemployment figures while more than 250,000 people are below the employment radar. The new minister can make a difference in some areas, but in others he or she will be beholden to the chancellor - be it Gordon Brown or someone else. The case for harmonising Northern Ireland's level of corporation tax with that of the Irish Republic has been strongly made by the local political parties and many business leaders and economists. So far, the treasury has resisted calls for the 30% rate paid by all UK businesses to be reduced for Northern Ireland companies to 12.5%. Gordon Brown hasn't ruled it out, but his closest advisers say he won't, and can't, do it without invoking demands for a similar perk from Scotland, Wales and parts of northern England, all of which are desperate to encourage business growth and foreign investment. The argument for lower corporation tax is still being put forward by all of the political parties, but it will be for the new economy minister - and the new finance minister - to decide if it's an attainable goal and if they can spare the time and the effort to fight for it.

Oliver role beckons for Gwion, 11
Gwion had to perform live on television each week
An 11-year-old Carmarthenshire boy has spoken of his excitement after being chosen to star as Oliver in a musical in London's West End.
Gwion will share the title role with Harry, 12, and Laurence, 11, in Cameron Mackintosh's forthcoming show.
They were chosen by Mackintosh and Andrew Lloyd Webber from eight finalists who appeared on the BBC show I'd Do Anything.
He will start rehearsals in October for the show, which opens in December.
Gwion, who had been whittled down from thousands at auditions, said: "It was very nerve-wracking at first waiting to find out and then, when I was told I was Oliver I was ecstatic.
"I couldn't quite believe it and I thought I was dreaming. My mum gave me the biggest hug ever and I couldn't breathe."
Lord Lloyd Webber, who is also judging potential Nancys in the television show, said: "Cameron and I agree we have three very different Olivers, but I think it's a great result and I think whichever Oliver you go and see you're going to get a fantastic performance."
Gwion will perform with the three finalists for the Nancy role - Jessie, Jodie and Samantha - on Saturday before the public vote for their favourite.
He was very popular and we did think he had a bit of a chance
Davina Evans, Gwion's teacher
He will then return to school on Monday for the final weeks of the term before he leaves for secondary school.
His teacher Davina Evans said the whole school was proud of him and had been supporting him during the weeks he had appeared on the TV show.
She said: "A couple of teachers have been up to the show and we realised by the response from the Nancys and from everybody there that he was very popular and we did think he had a bit of a chance but then again you're too frightened to set your sights too high.
"But we're delighted now that he has got the part.
She called Gwion a "very busy boy" with many hobbies, including swimming and playing the piano and cornet.
"He's a child that gives 100% to everything," she said.
"He takes everything in his stride."
Gwion will rotate the role of Oliver with fellow finalists Harry, from Oxfordshire - who has a Welsh-speaking mother Sian - and Laurence, from Cheshire.
They competed with the other finalists, taking on an "Oliver task" each week and performing a group number in the main television show. Unlike the women auditioning for the role of Nancy, the boys were not chosen by the public.
