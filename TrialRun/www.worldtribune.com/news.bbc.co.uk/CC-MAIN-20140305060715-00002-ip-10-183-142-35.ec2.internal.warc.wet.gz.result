Sun calls for Microsoft to be kept intact
Microsoft awaits the outcome of an anti-trust lawsuit
By the BBC's Richard Quest from Telecom 99 in Geneva.
As the Microsoft anti-trust trial draws to a close, one of its competitors has said that he doesn't want the computer software giant to be broken up into several parts.
These parts are often called Baby Bills after the founder Bill Gates.
Mr Scott McNeally, CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the world's largest computer network companies, said that breaking up Microsoft up was the last thing he wanted.
Microsoft, the world's biggest software company, is awaiting the outcome of an anti-trust lawsuit brought by the US government, which accuses it of abusing a monopoly position in the computer operating systems market - a charge Microsoft denies. Mr McNeally's views contrast with those of Larry Ellison, chairman of software developer Oracle. He says Microsoft had broken anti-trust laws and should be broken up. In an interview with the BBC at Telecom 99 in Geneva, Mr McNeally said: "We don't need more Microsofts."
Instead, he said the judge should ensure that the company has transparent pricing and is unable to pose an illegal threat to their competitors.
Shutting out competition
Particularly, he criticised the way Microsoft has shut out competition in many markets.
"The most important remedy must be that Microsoft not be allowed to invest in new companies and buy out new technology companies, it just doesn't make sense."
Then, referring to the 1920's anti-trust case against Standard Oil, he commented that "Rockefeller should not have been allowed to buy every gas station in the world and Microsoft should not be allowed to buy all its customers."
The issue clearly hits Sun Microsystems hard, which, with its Java programme, now competes directly with Microsoft Windows for customers. Mr McNeally believes the best way to handle the Seattle company is to constrain it. Referring to the agreements in the similar case of IBM in the 1970s and 80s he said that "if it had not been for the (court) scrutiny we would not have gotten Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Sun and all the companies ... And IBM was still a wonderful company" without being broken up.
Laughing at Microsoft
Mr McNeally's pique with Microsoft goes much deeper though: Here in Geneva he said he "laughed" when Bill Gates launched his internet policy of "Anywhere, Anytime, Any device" in Geneva on Tuesday. "We've been saying that for a few years. Some of our competitors have just figured it out."
The idea for Sun Microsystems is to continue developing systems that do allow for the integration of wireless technology with the internet. Mr McNeally wants to create a world where the television, or cellular phone allows you to surf the net, shop at auctions and buy and sell stocks. And although that might be some way off for some neighbourhoods, he is confident that it is only a matter of time before this is enjoyed by everyone.
Opportunity for developing world
But wandering around the convention halls here in Geneva, with the huge number of gadgets on display it is becoming clear that there are those who are connected and those who are not. Critics claim that the developing world is being left out by this new converged connected world.
Mr McNeally bristles at that, "it is false, misleading and potentially worrying."
Far from creating Haves and Have Nots in the world, he says cellular and internet convergence offers "real opportunities ... you can do distance learning without building a school, because that is not going to happen for some time. Or Telemedicine. I think the net is about helping and closing the gap, not creating a larger gap."

Thousands 'to miss out on university degree'
By Hannah Richardson
BBC News education reporter
Individual figures for universities will not come until March Hundreds of thousands of would-be students will be denied a university place because of spending cuts, says higher education body Universities UK.Universities' funding body Hefce will later outline how spending on teaching, research and capital will be allocated in England in the next academic year. For 2010-11, cuts of £135m have been added to "efficiency savings" of £180m - with a further £600m to follow. Higher Education Minister David Lammy said the fears were "scaremongering". Professor Steve Smith, president of vice-chancellors' group Universities UK, said the cuts would impact on the quality of teaching, as managers prepared to cut teaching budgets for the first time since Labour came to power. He added that the cuts would increase competition for places. SPENDING ON UNIVERSITIES
Finland 1.6%
Sweden 1.4%
France 1.1%
United States 1%
Germany 0.9%
UK 0.9%
Poland 0.9%
Spain 0.9%
Italy 0.7%
Japan 0.5%
Source: OECD, public spending on higher education as percentage of GDP. Most recent figures 2006. (UK combined figure for England, Scotland, Wales and N.Ireland) Mr Smith, vice chancellor of Exeter University, said: "Last year about 160,000 students who applied didn't end up going to university. "This year, we already know that there are about another 75,000 applying for university." This means that more than 200,000 could miss out, he said. He added: "So the number of students who go to university will be less than the number that actually want to go and thus there will be a lot of students this year who do not get a place at university." Although Universities UK represents higher education bodies across the UK, these funding arrangements relate to England. 'Meltdown'Last month, leaders of the top universities said the programme of cuts could cause a "meltdown" in their sector. The Russell Group of leading research universities warned that a succession of cuts could lead to universities and courses closing and much higher student ratios, damaging "gold standard" universities beyond repair.

This is wasting talent needed for an efficient and successful economy and it's extremely short-sighted.

Higher Education Minister for England, Mr Lammy, said the savings were relatively small and that he was confident that Hefce could achieve these in a way that "minimises the impact on teaching". He said: "Investment in higher education has gone up by 25% since 1997. Next year there will be more students at university than every before in our history." He said that university entrance had always been a competitive business and added that the ratio of lecturers to students was higher today than it was five years ago. The funding council is giving more detail than it normally would because of the unexpected cuts announced before Christmas. A Hefce spokesman said it would be giving the detail of high-level decisions it had made on how to allocate funding to universities. International comparisons"The main purpose of this announcement is for the sector to be able to plan," he said. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Wes Streeting of the National Union of Students and Anastasia de Waal from think tank Civitas debate a possible reduction in degrees
"We are issuing something that has a lot more detail this year, because of the current financial situation, because of the extra pressures." It will be sent out urgently to vice-chancellors by e-mail to enable them to redraw their budgets. However, the announcement will not be broken down by university or course subject. Universities will get those figures in March. The savings of nearly £315m are expected in 2010-2011 from universities' £7.3bn teaching budgets set out in the last comprehensive spending review. However, overall spending on higher education will increase compared to last year. Further savings of £600m across the higher education, science and research budgets are required over 2011-2013. General secretary of the University and College Union Sally Hunt said the higher education system was already creaking under the pressure of government efficiency savings and the planned cuts would be a devastating blow. "Other leading economies are investing money in universities in order to help economic growth and widen participation, yet our government seems intent on doing the opposite." Liberal Democrat universities spokesman Stephen Williams said the government's target to get half of young people into university was proving to be "empty rhetoric". "Targeting universities for cuts in this way is setting us up to see record numbers of bright young people turned away this summer."

Gary Neville says 'time will heal' Rooney ructions

Neville excited by Hernandez talent
Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes that the ructions caused by Wayne Rooney's contract saga will be forgotten by fans at Old Trafford.England striker Rooney, 25, signed a new five-year deal on Friday only days after saying he wanted to leave. That was following protests by fans outside his Cheshire home on Thursday. "It will take time to settle down but once it settles down and time heals he will go on to have a great career and win trophies here," said Neville. "The right thing has happened for Wayne, for his career, for his life," added Neville, who was speaking after playing his 600th game for United in the 2-1 away win over Stoke. "He has made the right decision. "The club gets to keep a great player - someone who works hard for the team every week." Sunday's win ended a turbulent week for Ferguson. "The players are no problem. Some agents are difficult," stated the 68-year-old United manager.
606: DEBATE
Give your reaction to Neville's backing for Rooney
"It is always tough at United. There are always issues to deal with. When your top players come towards the end of their contracts you have to do something to get them a new one. "They are all the same. You have to deal with agents of this world, which is difficult." Although Ferguson did not name any agents specifically, Rooney's agent Paul Stretford, who has been representing the striker since he was 18, played a key role in the negotiations to secure his client the lucrative contract last week. It was Stretford who informed Manchester United chief executive David Gill that Rooney no longer wanted to remain at Old Trafford in August. After Ferguson insisted both before and after Wednesday's Champions League win over Bursaspor that he wanted Rooney to stay, the striker asked Stretford to set up meetings which ended with him signing his new deal on Friday.

Spurs vice-chairman Kemsley quits
Tottenham vice-chairman Paul Kemsley has resigned from the board with immediate effect. The announcement was made to the Stock Exchange as Spurs also revealed �28m profits for the last financial year.
Kemsley was said to be closely involved in the club's attempts to bring Seville coach Juande Ramos to White Hart Lane.
He was part of a delegation which travelled to Spain to speak to Ramos but has now left the club to focus on business interests in the USA.
Chairman Daniel Levy said: "It is with regret that I announce the resignation of Paul Kemsley.
"Paul has recently expanded his property business interests in the United States and feels that inevitably his time spent overseas will impact upon his ability to fulfil his role with the club.
"Paul has worked with me for the past six years at the club and I thank him for his advice and counsel during this period."

The club's financial position is healthy, with a record turnover and profit for the last financial year.
Last year's Uefa Cup campaign, when Martin Jol's side reached the quarter-final stage, and successive fifth-placed Premier League finishes, led to the club posting a turnover of �103.1m for the year ending 30 June 2007, up �29m on the 2006 figures.
Operating profit before football trading and depreciation increased from �4.6m to �32m while operating profit before training totalled �29.7m from �2.4m for the previous year.
The club's profit before tax increased massively to �27.7m from �600,000 with retained profit for the year �18.9m.
