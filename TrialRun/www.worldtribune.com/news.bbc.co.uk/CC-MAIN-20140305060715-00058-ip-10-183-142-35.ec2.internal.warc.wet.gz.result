Guildford Cathedral is a regular target for criminals
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Guildford Cathedral has yet again become the target of vandalism when a large grass fire was started in the grounds this weekend. In December 2009, the building which overlooks the town, was subject to an overnight assault resulting in damage costing thousands of pounds. Guildford Cathedral's Administrator Tony Lyddon says they face a 'continual battle' with vandalism and petty crime. So what can we do to protect the mother church of the Diocese of Guildford? BBC Surrey's Aurelia Allen asks Tony his views on how the problem could be solved. Story Tools

BBC pundits on England
Alan Hansen
BBC Sport football expert and Match of the Day summariser The first question you ask is why play the 3-5-2 formation, especially after the inept performance at the weekend?
Against Macedonia their fundamentals were all over the place - they didn't pass the ball well. If you play badly you go safe and with what players are comfortable with - confidence is low and so you go back to basics.
You don't go with three centre-backs that have probably never played together in that system.
I don't think we will be seeing 3-5-2 for a long time
To play 3-5-2 you need pace up front to stretch the play and you look at that line-up and think they are going to struggle.
England defender John Terry came out in support when he is not going to go against the manager.
But people talk in the dressing room and the consensus of opinion of the vast majority of players is they don't like three centre-backs, so why play it?
I played with three centre-backs maybe five or six times and I always thought it was defensive.
The defenders get too close together and you end up with two or three going for the same ball.
What happens is that at some point nobody goes for it and we saw that two minutes into the match when Terry and Jamie Carragher went for same ball.
For the first goal you had six white shirts against two and nobody dealt with it - everybody was looking and nobody was picking the Croatia players up.
I don't think we will be seeing 3-5-2 for a long time.
Alan Shearer
Former England striker and Match of the Day summariser
I can understand Steve McClaren trying to do things differently. Maybe he thinks we have played 4-4-2 for 40 years now and not won anything.
But trying it in our most difficult away game I cannot understand.
No-one plays this in the league so for 10 months you play 4-4-2, and so to come out and play it once a season is almost impossible.
With 3-5-2 you need pace up front or you don't stretch teams and the ball is going one way all the time.
Five months away is a long time to wait to get rid of a bad result
Wayne Rooney needs space to turn and Peter Crouch is a target man who needs to bring other players into play.
No-one is running in behind the defence where Frank Lampard wants to play the ball.
It makes it easy for defenders when Rooney and Crouch both go towards the ball rather than running behind defenders.
It is too easy for defenders when they are not being stretched or pulled around.
When Jermain Defoe came on he went towards the goal and for the first time the Croatia defenders had some thinking to do. They had to run towards their own goal which defenders do not want to do.
I thought Paul Robinson was partly at fault for the first goal.
From a corner he opted to punch away when he could have caught it and it never got cleared.
It kept coming into the box and then when the cross came over he was still going forward - if he was in the right position he would have picked the ball up easily.
The second goal just summed up what a torrid evening it was for England. It was just a nightmare.
The next competitive game is about five months away, which is a long time to wait to get rid of a bad result.

Tuncay and Mido set for Boro exit
Southgate is braced for more departures
Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate says he expects that strikers Tuncay and Mido will leave the club soon.Both players were missing from the Boro side that thrashed Dumbarton 5-0 in their friendly last night. Southgate admits it is likely the pair will follow Stewart Downing in leaving the relegated Riverside Stadium side. "We know that Mido would like to move on in an ideal world - as would Tuncay - and I'm sure those deals will happen," he told the Northern Echo. "But that doesn't take care of itself. It is something I have to deal with, but while I'm here, my focus is on the players who have come on this trip." Turkey international Tuncay currently has a back injury, while Egypt forward Mido was fined by the Championship club for returning to pre-season training two weeks late.

In pictures: Orbea bike factory
Orbea was originally set up in the Basque village of Mallabia in 1840 as a weapons manufacturer and only started producing bicycles in the 1930s
The design of a new mountain bike can take many months. Mikel Bergara produces a 3D image of the bike before producing a plastic mould which can then be used to assess how well it works
Once a newly-designed bike has been thoroughly tested, the mountain bike is signed off and ready to be put into mass production
The separate components that make up a mountain bike are individually built in the Far East and assembled at this factory in the north of Spain
The bike frames are sprayed with a robot that has been carefully calibrated to cover every part of the frame with an even layer of paint
The final touches are applied by hand by some of the 200 strong army of workers that start at six o'clock in the morning
Once the frames have been painted, they join an assembly line where the rest of the bike's components are added
Orbea produce around 600 bikes a day and in 2009 their turnover was 60 million euros
At the end of the assembly line the bikes are carefully packaged, after all, some of these bikes retail for several thousand pounds The bikes are packaged and then sent to their distributors throughout the world - places as far afield as Mexico, Japan and Singapore
