News Online readers sceptical on Bush
Within hours of the final result of the US election, hundreds of e-mails poured into BBC News Online with readers' verdicts on the outcome.
While some voiced confidence in the new president-elect, the most common reaction was alarm at the prospect of a George W Bush presidency.
We can only echo Mr Gore: God Save America
Sally McDonald, US In response to a Talking Point question asking whether George W Bush would make a good world leader, a large majority of the emails received said no. Many were scathing in their remarks.
"This man isn't just dim, he's dangerous," wrote M Bailey from Brussels.
"The man is bereft of political experience or wisdom, and with a passion for legislated murder that surely terrifies anyone with a shred of a conscience," Jim Smith wrote from London.
"We can only echo Mr Gore: God Save America," wrote Sally McDonald from the US. E-mails came in from every continent, concerned about the possible prospect of a more isolationist US foreign policy. Many focused on his reported ignorance of world affairs and world leaders.
The people Bush has surrounded himself with are remarkably capable
John Hare, Texas "It is extremely scary that the leader of the free world cannot name the leaders of India and Pakistan," wrote S Kennedy from Seoul.
Others recalled his public speaking blunders, astonished that someone so prone to making gaffes would now be the most powerful man in the world.
"The sheer lack of articulation and understanding of world issues is astounding," wrote Steve Lovell from Leeds in the UK . "On a simpler note," he added, "why should we trust anyone who comes from a family where they name their progeny after themselves? "
Giving Bush a chance
I'd like to point out that we elect our president to run our country, not the world
James F, Washington DC Some, like James F from Washington DC, were annoyed at the criticism, which he thought was unfair:
"My confidence in the USA's best friend, the UK, has been shaken by all these comments," he wrote.
"I'd like to point out that we elect our president to run our country, not the world." And others were willing to give Mr Bush a chance.
"Let's wait and see. I hope that he will be less pro-Israel than Gore or Clinton and will be more pragmatic when dealing with the Middle East peace process," wrote Mohamed Benomar from Morocco. However, many took cheer from his ability to delegate.
"The people Bush has surrounded himself with are remarkably capable. His practice of delegating authority will be well served," said John Hare in Texas. Model of democracy?
Many were shocked not so much by the result, as the way in which it was reached, pointing to the fact that Mr Bush lost the popular vote.
Matthew Salter from London said: "America will no longer be able to lecture the rest of the world about the sacredness of democracy." And Rita Kitto from Geneva wrote in with a sarcastic suggestion that she said could save Americans millions in tax-payers money. "Next time, instead of running a presidential election campaign, why not just give the names of the two candidates to the Supreme Court and ask them to choose?"

In pictures: Ecuador coup
The head of the armed forces in Ecuador has set up a three-man council to take over the running of the country after thousands of indigenous indians from across the country gathered in the capital, Quito.
Thousands of people surround Ecuador's national palace hours after a rebellion led by indigenous indians backed by the military.
Cars were set on fire during demonstrations in the town of Guayaquil, where a group of leftist-led unions, student organisations and neighbourhood associations seized the provincial government building.
Police arrest looters, who took advantage of the emotionally charged atmosphere on the streets of the capital.
The indigenous leader Antonio Vargas (right) - a member of the new junta - salutes Ecuadoreans from a government balcony in Quito. A crowd celebrates in Independence square in Quito after the announcement that a Government of National Salvation - led by a three-person junta - was being set up.

Appeal to keep Beethoven's Ninth
Elgar's Gerontius score features in the collection
The British Library is appealing to the public to help it raise the money to buy an archive of original musical scores that includes the manuscript for Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The library needs to raise ï¿½200,000 more to meet the ï¿½1m asking figure for the Royal Philharmonic Society's collection.
The society's collection includes working papers, minute books and correspondence with great composers and performers.
It contains 250 manuscript scores, and took 250 years to build up.
Beethoven: Corresponded with the society
In a letter written by Beethoven just eight days before his death, in 1827, the composer pledges to write what would have been his 10th symphony in the society's honour.
"I will undertake to return to the society my warmest thanks by engaging to compose for it a new symphony, sketches for which are already in my desk," Beethoven wrote.
Now, however, the society is unable to meet the expense of curating its archive.
A spokeswoman told BBC News Online: "We have absolutely no resources."
The collection had been offered to the British Library, rather than to any other institution, she said, because so that it would remain accessible to the public, and in London.
Nothing can replace the magic of seeing and working from an original musical score
Mitsuko Uchida
"It's an important scholarly resource, and the library can preserve it for the future," she said.
The library is currently exhibiting some of the items, including the Beethoven score and the score for Mendelssohn's first symphony. It has until the end of the year to raise the money.
It says it is confident of doing so - but warns that if it does not, the archive could end up going abroad and being broken up.
The money raised so far is a mix of the British Library's own funds, grants and cash pledges.
Chief among the pledges is a Heritage Lottery Fund commitment to contribute ï¿½400,000 - but before the promise is realised, the total must be met.
Launching the library's appeal, renowned pianist Mitsuko Uchida, said: "Nothing can replace the magic of seeing and working from an original musical score."
To work from the original score was to "follow the composer's thoughts and corrections across the page", she said.

UK extends Sierra Leone mission
Fears that UK soldiers could be drawn into the fighting
British forces will have a wider mission in Sierra Leone, staying for at least another month and having a freer hand to support the United Nations, the UK Government has announced.
Our task there is first of all to make sure British lives are safe
Robin Cook Under pressure to clarify the exact nature of British involvement in the crisis, the government said UK troops would not be committed to a combat role, but would continue to offer technical and logistical support while the UN builds up its forces.
The announcement came as it emerged that four UN military observers - three Britons and a New Zealander - who were being held captive by rebels had managed to escape and made their way to safety in Freetown.
The four had been captured in Magburaka during a conflict between Revolutionary United Front rebels and Kenyan UN peacekeepers at the beginning of last week.
British military spokesman Lieutenant Tony Cramp, said the four slipped away from their captors at the end of last week and were picked up Tuesday by a helicopter.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook would not be drawn on what British troops would do if UN forces were under attack and taking casualties.
'Force flexibility'
He told the BBC: "Our task there is first of all to make sure British lives are safe, and we've gone a long way to achieving that, and secondly to provide assistance to the UN force in making sure it is not going to be put in that position."
Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the Sierra Leone crisis with senior ministers in an hour-long meeting at Downing Street on Thursday.
A spokesman for number 10 said Mr Blair confirmed "the British forces would continue their mission to evacuate UK and other nationals, and secure Lungi airport while the UN force builds up over the next month".
The arrival of HMS Ocean, with its complement of Royal Marines, would provide further "force flexibility", and allow for the relief of those forces already
deployed.
Troops bolstering their position around Freetown
"Ministers agreed that an effective UN force offers the best hope for lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone," the spokesman said.
But the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says the statement is merely catching up with reality on the ground, where it is already clear British forces are providing a leadership role for the UN troops.
There are about 1,000 British troops in and around the capital Freetown. Sierra Leone, a former British colony, says UK soldiers have a duty to intervene to suppress the rebels and help restore peace.
The government statement allows the paratroops to provide considerable support to strengthen the UN and the wording is deliberately vague, allowing a wide range of extra help, short of joining the UN force or taking an active combat role.
Ministers do not intend to have a debate in the House of Commons on the issue, despite pressure from the Opposition.

PAPER MONITOR FRIDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 1100 BST
A service highlighting the riches of the daily press.
So when is Tony Blair going to resign? After months of speculation, the Guardian has been taking soundings from the prime minister's friends and tells us it's next summer. So that settles it. Only over at the Times, matters are less cut-and-dried. It's been talking to the big kahuna himself and the verdict is - not telling. Paper Monitor finds itself wondering what does his contract of employment say about the length of notice he's obliged to give. Anyone who's been in a senior job for almost 10 years would normally be expected to serve out several months, while the employer tries to fill the vacancy.
No such luxury for President Bush - at least if the plot to Channel 4's latest controversial offering - Death of a President - were to come true. The film portrays a fictional assassination of the US president - a plot that has outraged some Americans. Not that the Daily Mail gives a stuff, asking "What if it DID happen?" Historian Mark Almond - no, not that one - is on hand to speculate. And it's not a pretty scenario, as America is imagined to descend into an authoritarian regime, and fight a bloody war on Iran. The sentence "Cheney's re-election campaign in 2008" will send shivers down some spines. But here, at least, is someone prepared to stick his neck out and put a date on the end of Mr Blair's term in office, although Brownites won't like it one bit. "When Tony Blair stepped down in 2009 to join President Cheney's Anti-Assassination Commission, it was David Cameron who won the election."

PAPER MONITOR THURSDAY 31 AUGUST 1402 BST
A service highlighting the riches of the daily press.
Late! Late! For a very important date!
With a change of season almost upon us, Paper Monitor has been poring over the pages and pages of fashion advice to glean some tips.
And what tips to be had. White handbags are trendy again. Looking like a pirate is too (if you're Kate Moss and topless on the Sun's Page Three. Or in an Adam Ant tribute band. Or Johnny Depp. Obviously).
Even that icon of effortless good looks, Victoria Beckham, has been sharing her style secrets in a new book. The Daily Mirror's puff piece is illustrated with "now" and "then" snaps of the former Spice Girl. Then, in a photo from her school days, she accessorised with a perm (didn't we all), flesh on her cheeks (ditto) and a smile. Now, at age 32, a smile is the last item one would expect to find in her dressing up box.
Her tips? Why Paper Monitor can't wait to share them with you. Avoid horizontal stripes. Flat shoes with skinny jeans means you look like a golf club. Don't eat beetroot because it stains. Words to live by.
And as befits the anniversary of Diana's death, the Daily Telegraph's fashion advice is that ruffles - a la the princess's wedding dress - are back. As are the designers behind that frilly confection. So that's Paper Monitor's Christmas Party outfit sorted.

Adrian, this is how it works. Crude oil is drilled for in hostile conditions in the North Sea. It is piped ashore, refined and taken to petrol stations. The Government then nearly trebles the price with duty and VAT so it ends up costing 95p a litre. Water comes out of the ground. It is bottled and goes to the shops. It is sold (inc VAT) at ï¿½1.20 a half-litre. This is what's known technically as a "con". Refill empty 250ml bottles with tap-water and carry one with you. End of con.Ken, Hornchurch

PUNORAMA ***UPDATED*** WEDNESDAY 30 AUGUST 1214 BST
The rules are as simple as could be: we pick a story in the news, you come up with a punning headline. This week it was the story of a student whose home-made movie film about his love of pancakes became an internet hit and how he uses his fame to recommend Aberdeen University.
James Provan (right) loves pancakes so much he shot a video in his flat about how to make them and stuck it on YouTube. It became a hit, catapulting Mr Provan to global fame - an achievement that set him on course to become an ambassador for his university.
So, how did you punsters do? Many of you took James' surname as your inspiration, including Mark Wrighton in London with Flip-tastic video is a Provan success, Mal Walker in Adelaide, Australia, with Pancake movie a Provan success and O.G.Nash in Doha, Qatar, with Video Provan anyone can be a star
Thinking along the same lines were DS in Bromley, England, and Martin Price in the UK with Panbassador. Also, Norm Brown in Australia and Gareth Jones in Anglesey with Flour of Scotland.

Aww. The summer is not yet over when a picture of Bambi makes it onto the front page of the Times. But Paper Monitor fair choked on its porridge on turning, as directed, to page five to read all about the cute baby deer. The headline? "EXTENDED DEER CULL WOULD PUT ORPHAN FAWNS IN HUNTERS' SIGHTS."
And what's this? It's a Wednesday and there's Princess Diana smiling prettily from the front page of the Daily Express. Are they messing with our minds at Desmond Towers? For she was on the front page on Tuesday too. That, thanks to the Bank Holiday, was the first day of the working week, so Tuesday was in effect Monday (a day on which the paper found room for its favourite princess on the front page, as tradition dictates).
But all becomes clear on turning to pages 18 to 21 as directed. It's the ninth anniversary of her death on Thursday, so expect an entire newspaper devoted to her final days tomorrow.
How could this important date have slipped Paper Monitor's mind when the Express works so tirelessly to make every week a Diana week? The Daily Mirror, meanwhile, has another anniversary in mind. If a picture of a tear-stained and frustratrated New Orleans resident tells a thousand words, its headline provides the sobering caption: "270,000 PEOPLE HAVE LEFT. LESS THAN A THIRD OF SCHOOLS ARE OPEN. ONLY THREE HOSPITALS ARE WORKING. JUST HALF THE BUS ROUTES RUNNING. THIS IS THE SCANDAL OF NEW ORLEANS ONE YEAR AFTER THE HURRICANE."
All the while, another storm bears down on the coast. For it is hurricane season once again.

Charles Kennedy is back in the papers. Two days ago the Observer ran an interview with the former Lib Dem leader where he revealed a desire to get back on the party's front bench at some time.
The Times has followed this today with the first part of its serialisation of Greg Hurst's alcohol-centred biography of Mr Kennedy. The splash suggests Mr Kennedy's drink problem goes back further than previously thought. It's the only political story of the day. Even the Daily Telegraph has to acknowledge its existence. Although because of a shortage of space on page two, it is not able to mention the newspaper where you can find the serialisation. The Times. Or the nature of his day job. Political correspondent at the Times.
Page three in the Daily Mail, Daily Express, Mirror and even the Daily Telegraph has the reunited, original Charlie's Angels, resplendent at the Emmys. But the real highlight is the focus on Dame Helen Mirren's ï¿½20 "stripper shoes" in the Express. Many of the papers have leads on Roger Annies, the rebel postman and budding hero of Middle England. Mr Annies has been suspended by the Royal Mail after telling the residents on his round they could opt out of unaddressed junk mail. In the Mirror, that's p16. And on p17?

The Daily Telegraph rejoices in a chance to use a front page photo that ticks the key boxes: "posh", "blonde" and "attractive". It's Zara Phillips of course, fresh from her emotional triumph at the World Equestrian Games in Germany.
But they are not alone. She also makes the front of the Daily Mail and the Times. Even the staunchly republican Guardian has to swallow its pride and prominently feature a royal achieving something.
The papers that shy away from Zara? The Daily Star fills its attractive blonde quota with Bianca Gascoigne, the Daily Mirror features Peaches Geldof, and of course the front page of the Daily Express is only big enough for one posh attractive blonde - Diana.
Only the front pages of the Independent and the Financial Times are free of attractive blondes. Phew.
The now-obligatory poster front on the Indy proclaims the saving of 16 threatened bird species from extinction. Readers can enjoy their bank holiday safe in the knowledge that the Pale-headed brush finch is doing OK.
Over in the Financial Times, there is a picture story on Construction Jihad, the extraordinarily named civil engineering wing of Hezbollah.
And in the Mail, page 13's lead poses the burning question of the day: "Could my dog find me a man?" Puppy dating is the latest thing, apparently, with celebs like Ben Fogle and Davina McCall finding their other halves thanks to canine collisions. Ah, August bank holiday, the pinnacle of the silly season, and Paper Monitor sees everything is well.

Scots rape laws scrutinised
Judges are being urged to "modernise" rape law Scottish rape laws have been undergoing scrutiny from judges considering a controversial ruling that having sex without the woman's consent is not necessarily rape. The review follows criticism of judge Lord Abernethy who dismissed a case against a law student because there was no evidence he used force against his alleged victim.
Scotland's most senior law officer, the Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC, asked seven judges at the High Court in Edinburgh to rule that consent, rather than force, was the main issue in deciding whether a woman has been raped.
He told presiding judge Lord Cullen and the six other judges that the court should take the "modern view" that the act of having sex with someone who was not consenting amounted to an assault and implied the use of force.
Colin Boyd asked the panel to focus on consent
The panel's eventual decision will not bind a judge in any future case, but it is recognised their ruling will have the effect of creating a new legal definition of rape. Murray Macara, a criminal lawyer with Glasgow firm Beltrami, welcomed the review. He said: "There is so much controversy regarding rape that I think a review is overdue.
"What we want to see is clarity, what we want to see as a result of the debate that has been stimulated is some degree of certainty in the law so that as far as I am concerned, as far as lawyers are concerned, we know where we stand."
Women's groups, who were vocal in their criticism of Lord Abernethy's decision, welcomed Tuesday's hearing.
They said it shows the controversial interpretation of the law is being taken seriously.
Sandy Brindley, of the Rape Crisis Centre, said Lord Abernethy's ruling did not reflect the reality of sexual violence.
'Proof of the crime'
"Often what happens is that a woman freezes with fear or with shock and is unable to struggle or fight her attacker off," she said.
The lord advocate told the hearing that Scotland's rape laws had been formed at a time when women's social status was lower and suggested that the law should reflect the fact that society had "moved on".
Mr Boyd said: "My argument, put shortly, is that the essence of the crime of rape is lack of consent and proof of force is not necessary to the proof of the crime."
Edward Watt was acquitted
He insisted he was not asking the court to rule whether or not Lord Abernethy had made a mistake in interpreting the law, but to consider the wider issues raised by the case.
Lord Abernethy acquitted 23-year-old student Edward Watt during his trial at the High Court in Aberdeen in March after upholding a claim in Mr Watt's defence that he had no case to answer.
The judge said: "To have sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent
is not in itself rape."
Mr Boyd said the current definition of rape dated back to 1858, in a case where judges ruled that a woman had been raped if a man had sex with her "forcibly and against her will".
He said: "The position of women in society has changed radically since the time when they were regarded almost as a possession and had really no independent status.
"Force is not essential to the proof of the crime of rape, but where the accused knows that the woman is not consenting and continues on that basis to effect sexual intercourse without her consent, then the crime of rape is completed."
Ministers are awaiting the panel's ruling before deciding whether to bring a new law before the Scottish Parliament.

Heathrow protesters target Airbus
Pictures of the protest were sent out by Greenpeace
Climate change protesters banned from campaigning at Heathrow Airport have taken their demonstration to the Airbus Superjumbo factory in north Wales.
Six campaigners boarded a barge carrying a wing from the company's plant in Broughton, Flintshire.
A spokesman for campaign group Plane Stupid said Broughton was targeted in reaction to an injunction against protesters near London's Heathrow.
North Wales Police said the protesters were moved on after about an hour.
The Broughton plant produces wings for the A380, the world's largest passenger plane.
Last week, Heathrow operator BAA won a High Court ruling banning certain protesters taking action.
This is the end of today's protest, but you might find action being taken in other parts of the country this week
Leo Murray, Plane Stupid
Leo Murray, one of those affected by the Heathrow injunction, said he and five others had "set up camp" on the barge on Monday morning, and had hoped to remain on the barge until ministers came up with a "safe" aviation policy.
The protesters, who released their own video footage and still photographs of their actions, were later carried off by Airbus security staff.
He said: "We'd have liked to have delayed the barge for longer, but I think we've successfully highlighted the fact that A380 planes are by no means environmentally friendly.
"This is the end of today's protest, but you might find action being taken in other parts of the country this week."
He added: "Climate change is a global planetary emergency and aviation is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in Britain.
"Extraordinary times call for an extraordinary response, and that's why we've set up a climate camp under the wing of an Airbus super-jumbo.
"Plane Stupid believes the manufacture of thousands of new airliners to meet worldwide government-sponsored aviation expansion puts any chance we have of defeating climate change at grave risk.
Up to 2,000 people are expected at the protest near Heathrow
"Aeroplane manufacturers and airlines are at the forefront of lobbying for airport expansion across the globe. "While Airbus claims the A380 is more environmentally sound than previous models, the slight fuel efficiency gains made by technological developments will be more than wiped out by the huge increase in flights expected this century."
Protesters gathered near Heathrow to highlight their concerns that the rapid growth in air travel was a major factor in greenhouse gas emissions. Graham Thompson, of Plane Stupid, said the Broughton protest was the result of a "certain amount" of planning.
He added: "There is an injunction against taking action in and around Heathrow.
"To a certain extent this is a reaction to that."
Mr Thompson, who was not part of the Broughton demonstration, said the barge had not been damaged.
It was carrying an A380 wing along the River Dee to the port of Mostyn. From there, the wings are shipped to Airbus's final assembly plant in Toulouse.
Airbus said protesters had gained "unlawful entry," but the barge had not been delayed.
In a statement, the company added: "While Airbus agrees with people's right to demonstrate, safety and security are our paramount concerns at all times and demonstrations must be lawful and demonstrators must behave responsibly."
Near Heathrow, dozens of police officers have been inspecting a camp set up by protesters.
Up to 2,000 people are expected to pitch their tents for a week-long protest against plans to expand the airport.

Derby 3-0 Millwall
Derby inflicted more misery on Millwall with a resounding win that lifted them up to third in the Championship.
Craig Bryson's first Pride Park goal set them on their way and Jeff Hendrick extended the lead before half-time.
Derby's leading scorer Steven Davies added a third after the interval following good work from Jamie Ward.
The result leaves Millwall without a victory in six league matches and they have gone 505 minutes without scoring a Championship goal.
The home side took the lead after 24 minutes, when Ben Davies cut the ball back from the byeline for Bryson, who scored from 12 yards out.
The finisher then turned provider, passing from the right-hand side of the area for Hendrick to finish clinically.
Steve Davies grabbed his fourth goal of the season after the interval, slotting in Ward's pass from 12 yards out.
Listen to Derby County manager Nigel Clough's post-match interview with BBC Radio Derby.
Listen to Millwall manager Kenny Jackett's post-match interview with BBC London 94.9.
