Buick 'masturbation' car renamed
The Buick LaCrosse will launch next year
Red-faced officials at General Motors in Canada have been forced to think of a new name for their latest model after discovering it was a slang word for masturbation.
GM officials said they had been unaware that LaCrosse was a term for self-gratification among teenagers in French-speaking Quebec.
They are now working on a new name for the LaCrosse in Canada. The car will go on sale next year to replace the Buick Regal.
More recently, Mitsubishi had to change the name of its Pajero model in Spanish speaking countries, where the word is a slang term for "masturbator".
While Toyota's Fiera proved controversial in Puerto Rico, where fiera translated to "ugly old woman".
And Ford didn't have the reception it expected in Brazil when their Pinto car flopped.
They then discovered that in Brazilian Portuguese slang, pinto means "small penis". E-mail this to a friend

HIV infections 'may have peaked'
Two-thirds of people in Asia with HIV are in India
The rate at which people are infected with HIV may have peaked in the late 1990s, according to a UNAids report. It found the incidence of new HIV infections appears to have stabilised for the first time in 25 years.
UNAids said improved funding and access to drugs appeared to be producing results - but said HIV remained "an exceptional threat".
It warned the infection rate was still rising in some countries, and record numbers now live with the virus.
See map of worldwide HIV infection rates
The agency, which surveyed 126 countries, estimated that 38.6m people are living with HIV worldwide.
The actions we take from here are particularly important
Dr Peter Piot
India has most HIV cases
Case study: Zimbabwe
Have Your Say
It found that approximately 4.1m people were newly infected with the virus during 2005, and approximately 2.8m people died of Aids-related illnesses during the year.
The report warns young people and children are increasingly affected by the epidemic, and efforts to protect these groups are not keeping pace.
It found some countries were doing well on treating people with HIV, but poorly on HIV prevention efforts, while in others the opposite was true.
The report said there was still a need for improved planning, sustained leadership and reliable long-term funding - with current levels of spending still below what was required.
The report was released on the eve of a UN General Assembly meeting on Aids in New York to review progress in the five years since a major international declaration setting goals for tackling the virus.
Dr Peter Piot, UNAids executive director said efforts to combat HIV appeared to be starting to produce results.
He said: "The actions we take from here are particularly important, as we know with increasing certainty where and how HIV is moving, as well as how to slow the epidemic and reduce its impact."
Africa worst hit
Sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicentre of the Aids pandemic, with two-thirds of all people living with HIV coming from the region.
Two million people died of Aids in the region last year and there were 2.7m new infections.
However, the numbers affected in Eastern Europe and Asia continue to rise.
India, Ukraine and the Russian Federation are particularly badly affected.
India overtook South Africa as the world's worst-affected country in terms of the absolute number of people with HIV - although not as a proportion of the population.
The report says the "3x5" target to get anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to three million people by 2005 was missed, but access to treatment has significantly improved.
In 2001, just 240,000 people in developing countries had access to ART.
By 2005, that had risen to 1.3m.
However, UNAids said that means only one in five people around the world who need the drugs gets them.
The report calls for the price of ART drugs to be cut to widen access to treatment.
Prevention
The report found HIV prevention programmes are failing to reach those most at risk.
The UN's Declaration of Commitment on HIV/Aids said 90% of young people should know about the disease by 2005.
But surveys suggest fewer than 50% have comprehensive knowledge.
Just 9% of men who have sex with men received any type of HIV prevention advice, and only 20% of intravenous drug users.
However, there has been some success. Six out of 11 African countries reported declines of at least 25% in HIV prevalence among 15-24-year-olds in capital cities.
Rates of sex among young people declined in nine of 14 sub-Saharan countries.
And condom use with a non-regular partner increased in eight of 11 countries in the same region.
The report also called for a significant increase in funding.
It said $8.3bn was made available in 2005, more than five times the funding available in 2001.
However, it warns that over $20bn will be needed annually from 2008.
UNaids also called for world leaders to fulfil their commitment made at the 2005 G8 Summit to achieve universal access to HIV treatment by 2010.
Deborah Jack, of the UK's National Aids Trust, said: "Behind the shocking statistics there has been progress in improving access to drugs and in rolling out prevention programmes in developing countries. "This shows that interventions can and do work. But such efforts must be accompanied by the promotion of human rights."
Nick Partridge, of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "Governments and businesses across the world must continue to do more to increase access to anti-retroviral treatments, good sex education and condoms, which we know are vital in reducing the spread of HIV."

Religious warning to Saudi monarchy
Washington and the Saudi monarchy have cultivated close ties
By BBC Islamic affairs specialist Roger Hardy
A senior religious figure in Saudi Arabia has warned the country's ruling Al Saud family against siding with the United States against a Muslim country. In a series of fatwas - or religious rulings - Sheikh Hamoud bin Oqla al-Shuaibi has declared that those who support the non-believer against Muslims are themselves non-believers. The issues comes amid controversy over Prince Waleed's gift
The Saudi authorities are reported to have asked him to stop issuing fatwas, but he has refused. Sheikh Hamoud is a Wahhabi cleric, in his late 70s, who lives in Buraida - a town to the north of the capital, Riyadh, which has long been a centre of religious militancy. He has been in trouble before. He was imprisoned in 1995, along with other clerics who were critical of the Saudi ruling family for its policies during and after the Gulf war. Now the senior princes must be wondering whether they are going to face a fresh bout of Islamic dissent. Saudi nervousness
Since the attacks against America on 11 September, Sheikh Hamoud and at least six other religious figures have issued fatwas warning the authorities not to take the side of a non-Muslim power - in other words, America - against a Muslim country. There was no Saudi welcome for Blair during his recent Gulf tour
Some of them have appeared on the internet. Sheikh Hamoud is the most senior of these figures - and given his religious credentials, the ruling family can't ignore his warnings. The nervousness of Saudi officials over religious dissent in the kingdom may explain their reluctance to receive British Prime Minister Tony Blair, during his visit to the Gulf this week.
It has been reported that he has twice been called in for questioning by local officials, but has consistently refused to be silenced.

Forest tourists strike gold
The replica gold leaf was hidden in the forest in March
A Rotherham couple are �1,200 better off after uncovering a replica gold leaf, hidden in the Forest of Dean four months ago. The leaf was the treasure trove in a hunt for visitors designed to boost tourism. Robert and Diane Farmer were presented with the real gold leaf, at the Dean Heritage Museum on Wednesday.
Clues to the location of the leaf, hidden in March within the forest's 24,000 acres, were issued every two weeks to help visitors find the treasure.
Revived awareness
The leaf was originally unearthed a month ago but the finders, from Lowestoft, declined to claim the reward.
The stunt was a repetition of the successful Kit Williams' puzzle novel Masquerade, which gave clues to the location of a buried golden hare and sparked a nationwide hunt in the 1980s. Tourist bosses said the ploy had revived awareness of the forest as a visitor attraction.
"We don't have exact figures, but we know it's worked from the increased sale of Ordnance Survey maps," said Forest of Dean Council leader Anne Martin.
"The heritage centre has been inundated with emails, specifically about the hunt." Visitor numbers had dropped by nearly 90% following the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
The council now plans to launch another gold leaf hunt.
