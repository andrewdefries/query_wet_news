Spamalot reaps show nominations
Spamalot has been one of Broadway's hottest tickets
Monty Python musical Spamalot has picked up 12 Drama Desk nominations, honouring the best in New York theatre.
Based on the Monty Python and the Holy Grail film, the show has had largely rave reviews since opening on Broadway in March.
Romantic musical The Light in the Piazza received 11 nominations from the organisation of theatre critics.
The awards will be handed out at a ceremony hosted by Broadway star Harvey Fierstein on 22 May.
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, based on the hit movie comedy starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine, was named in 10 categories, including best musical.
The best musical shortlist features Spamalot, The Light in the Piazza, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, Altar Boyz and The Audience.
Early closure
British playwright Michael Frayn's Democracy has been nominated in the best play category, alongside The Pillowman, Sin (A Cardinal Deposed), Doubt and Pentecost.
David Hyde Pearce, best-known for playing Niles in Frasier, and Hank Azaria, a voice of The Simpsons, were both nominated for best musical actor for Spamalot.
Christiana Applegate's turn in Sweet Charity has been recognised, although she pulled out of the show with injury. The musical eventually closed before beginning its Broadway run. Among the nominations for best actor in a play were Adam Arkin for Brooklyn Boy, Bill Irwin for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and John Turturro for Souls of Naples.
On the actress in a play shortlist were Kathleen Turner for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Laura Linney for Sight Unseen and Frances Sternhagen for Echoes of War.
British comic Dave Gorman has been nominated in the solo performance category for his Googlewhack Adventure show, alongside Barry Humphries, Billy Crystal and Jackie Mason.
The Drama Desk, founded in 1949, honours both Broadway and off-Broadway productions.

EU bid to end Polish-Russian row
The EU is keen to improve energy co-operation with Russia
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen is to fly to the Polish capital Warsaw in an attempt to defuse a confrontation over the EU's relationship with Russia.
Poland is currently blocking the start of EU-Russia negotiations on a new strategic partnership agreement.
Warsaw has said before that the EU should be tougher with Russia, and it is now digging in, just a week before talks on the pact were due to start.
It wants a Russian ban on Polish meat and vegetable imports lifted first.
It also wants Russia to ratify an international agreement on energy investment and distribution.
BBC Europe correspondent Jonny Dymond says Poland is quite badly isolated within the EU on this question.
Only Lithuania fully supports its position.
Other countries, though they agree that Poland has a case, are frustrated with Poland's robust negotiating style, our correspondent says.
Mr Vanhanen has the role of attempting to persuade the Poles to back down because his country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
An EU-Russia summit is scheduled for 24 November, and the EU would like the negotiations on the new agreement with Russia to begin then.

All of UK on broadband 'by 2005'
The goal is to get all of the country on high-speed net
BT has said every community in the UK can have broadband net access by 2005.
"We are committed to getting 100% coverage to every community, but we need to work in partnership," said BT's Alison Ritchie.
The pledge comes as BT announced 32 more phone exchanges have been upgraded for high-speed net. It has also set trigger levels for all but 600 exchanges, meaning two million homes and businesses could get ADSL broadband if enough sign up for it.
Costs and demands
BT upgrades a telephone exchange for high-speed net via ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) when a trigger level is reached, which means a certain number of people say they want it.
"Our industry, along with government at all levels, has a huge role to play to accelerate broadband availability, demand and take-up," said Ben Verwaayen, BT Group chief executive.
The issue is about stimulating demand for broadband, and for me it is a local issue more than a national one. It's about making broadband relevant to business and consumers
Alison Ritchie, BT
BT said it decided to make the commitment to the 2,300 exchanges, as well as the 100% coverage target after reviewing its long-term broadband strategy and costs.
"With our latest understanding of technology and costs and the growing enthusiasm for regional partnerships, means we can take a new approach to broadband investments.
"We are now in a position to extend trigger levels into the furthest parts of the UK," said Mr Verwaayen.
Small but significant
The 600 remaining exchanges are "very small", BT claimed, accounting for about 100,000 households.
It said different approaches would be needed to get broadband into those areas, which are predominantly in rural places, involving more partnerships with public and private sectors to stimulate demand.
Trigger levels have long been criticised for being set too high, but BT said changes in equipment costs mean demand levels have been lowered.
"The issue is about stimulating demand for broadband, and for me it is a local issue more than a national one," said Ms Ritchie, BT's chief broadband officer.
"It's about making broadband relevant to business and consumers."
BT said these communities could use alternative technologies, such as wireless broadband, or satellite technologies.
Ms Ritchie also said BT is working on making sure ADSL-enabled exchanges reached homes that want high-speed net. Currently, even though some households and businesses are in ADSL areas, three to four percent are located too far from telephone exchanges to get the service.
The announcement coincided with a separate statement by the minister for e-commerce Stephen Timms MP, who announced last week that not only would all to the UK be online by 2005, but all would have access to broadband too.

Man fined for taking photograph
The fine was handed down at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
A man who took a photograph of an ill woman outside an Edinburgh bar has been fined �100 after being branded "unchivalrous" by a sheriff.
The woman had been drinking with friends in an Omni Centre bar when she felt unwell and went outside for air.
Sebastian Przygodzki took a photograph with his camera, which upset Rebecca Smith and her friends called police.
He was arrested and charged with breach of the peace, and pleaded guilty to the offence at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Przygodzki, 28, who moved to Scotland two years ago from Krakow, told police he had spent the day taking photographs of performers at the Edinburgh festival, which was in full swing at the time.
The lady concerned was entitled to her privacy and not to have a passing stranger take a photograph
Sheriff Kenneth HoggEdinburgh Sheriff Court
When he came across the woman, he considered it "taking a photo of another view of Edinburgh", said his lawyer, Andy Houston.
But Sheriff Kenneth Hogg said the matter "could be best described as exceptionally unchivalrous".
"The lady concerned was entitled to her privacy and not to have a passing stranger take a photograph," said the sheriff.
"I'm going to impose a fine to remind him chivalry is not dead and when somebody is in distress you leave them to it."
Fiscal depute Mhairi Vernon, prosecuting, said Ms Smith had become unwell in the bar in the city's Greenside Place about 2330 BST on Friday 8 August.
Mr Houston said Przygodzki, a first offender who lives with his girlfriend and works as a postman in Edinburgh, had enrolled in an arts and social sciences degree and was sorry for the "error of judgement".
"It was ill-judged, it was a spontaneous act and entirely inappropriate," said the solicitor.
"He accepts it was conduct liable to cause upset and did in fact cause upset.
"It's been a matter of severe regret for him. He's extremely anxious and very contrite about the affair."
