Airships to tackle Caracas crime
By James Ingham
BBC News, Caracas
Caracas has the world's worst figures for gun crime death
Airship in action
Officials in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, are taking to the air in an attempt to make the city safer. The council has bought three mini remote-controlled airships which are soon to be launched to look down on the city monitoring criminal activity. Each has a camera mounted on it, which beams back pictures to a control room.
The Venezuelan capital is regarded as one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America, with gun crime a particular problem.
There were a few strange looks skywards in Caracas as the new mini Zeppelin took to the skies. Steered by remote control from the ground, the balloon ducked and dived above the buildings, its pilot showing how manoeuvrable the machine can be. Presidential plan
The 15 metre (49 foot) long air ships are emblazoned with government slogans. Written in bright red are the words: "We watch over you for your security."
Some might worry that this will be intrusive - a big brother in the skies, spying on people the government wants to watch. But the man in charge of security in Caracas, Ramon Morales Rossi, played down that idea. Obviously I think this is the right thing to do. But we need as much security on the ground as in the air
Caracas resident
"Our intention is to reduce criminal activity in the city, that's a big problem, something the presidency has recognised," he said.
"It's part of a plan - working with the people, better education, better police officers and better equipment for the police."
Security, or the lack of it, is a big concern for many here. Caracas is one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America. The government has stopped publishing crime figures, but last year the UN said that per capita there were more deaths from guns than anywhere else in the world. Working under the gaze of the balloon, the people I spoke to backed this up. "It's good that there's a greater police presence. It's indispensable. Where's there no police presence, there's no security," said one. "Obviously I think this is the right thing to do. But we need as much security on the ground as in the air." The eyes in the sky will be controlled from a new base that is being kitted out in the city centre. Most Caracas residents agree something needs to be done to make the city safer. As they are watched, they will be watching too to see if these hi-tech machines make any difference to their lives.

View from Haiti: Aid worker
Prospery Raymond, Christian Aid's representative in Haiti, reports on the food riots that have plunged this troubled nation into crisis.
Prospery Raymond's family is running out of food because stores have closed It is getting very serious now. The stores are all closed and my family is running out of food. Even my six-year-old daughter knows that people are being killed on the streets. She has heard the shots and the rioters breaking windows.
Now the schools are closed, the markets are closed, and yesterday the airport closed for international flights - everyone is shut up at home. People are hungry and angry. There are food stocks in the dock but the importers cannot get them out. Looters are everywhere. They have even stormed a UN warehouse that was stockpiling emergency food rations in preparation for this year's hurricane season.
The staple foods in Haiti are rice and beans. We used to grow enough to feed ourselves, but most of our rice is imported from the US now and prices have shot beyond people's reach.
Soaring prices and food shortages in Haiti have led to riots and looting
A cup of rice costs about 50 gourdes. For those who are earning - and most are not - the average daily wage is only about 35 gourdes.
We still grow beans ourselves but last year's disasters, Hurricane Dean and Tropical Storm Noel, destroyed a lot of the harvest.
It is raining now in the north-west, and farmers should be planting their beans. But because there is no food, they have already eaten the grain and beans that they would have used as seed.
If our farmers cannot plant now, they will harvest nothing and the crisis will simply roll on for another year. They need seeds urgently.
Christian Aid's local partner is monitoring the situation in the north-west, and is hoping to provide corn, beans, sorghum and pistachio seeds to about 2,000 farmers here. If they plant now, they will have food again in a few months' time.
Rice does not grow well in the north-west, but in the areas where it does, the government too should be distributing seeds.
It is not good for a country as poor as ours to be so wholly reliant on buying in food, because when international prices rise, or disease strikes, people cannot eat
Supporting our rice farmers is vital, both immediately and in the longer term.
So far, the government has done little to address the problem. They urgently need to import food and start subsidising rice and beans. Lowering the price of petrol, as an emergency measure, would also help.
Ultimately, Haiti needs to do more to support its own producers.
We import 30 million eggs a month from the Dominican Republic, and only produce one million ourselves. This year there was an outbreak of bird flu in the DR, and our government banned all chicken and egg imports.
It is not good for a country as poor as ours to be so wholly reliant on buying in food, because when international prices rise, or disease strikes, people cannot eat.

EMI strikes a deal with YouTube
EMI bands such as the Rolling Stones will be available on YouTube
EMI has signed a deal with YouTube that will allow its users to access videos by EMI artists.
It means all four of the world's major music firms are now YouTube partners.
The terms of the agreement should eventually allow users to incorporate recordings by EMI artists into their own projects.
The deal follows a string of lawsuits by companies who accuse YouTube of allowing its users to pirate their copyrighted works.
The biggest threat comes from entertainment giant Viacom Media which is suing YouTube for $1bn (�505m).
The US group - which owns MTV and Nickelodeon - claims that the website uses its shows illegally.
User generated content
"We're excited to add EMI Music's stellar roster of artists' content to our site and make it available to our community," said Chad Hurley, chief executive of YouTube.
Eric Nicoli, chief executive of EMI Group, said the deal would "offer consumers the best possible entertainment experiences" by using "innovative business models that will generate revenues for our business and our creators". "Through this agreement EMI Music and its artists will be fairly compensated for their work," Mr Nicoli said.
EMI and YouTube have agreed to work together to develop ways in which EMI-owned recordings can be incorporated into user generated content by YouTube users. News of the deal comes just 10 days after EMI agreed to be taken over by private equity group Terra Firma for �2.4bn.
Google bought the video-sharing website for $1.65bn (�883m) in October 2006.

Lopez and Affleck go digital
The couple announed their engagement last month
Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have been turned into video game characters - as a thank you for starring in director Kevin Smith's new movie.
Smith, the man behind cult films Clerks and Chasing Amy, had the video game commissioned to thank the pair for starring in his film Jersey Girl.
The pair recently announced their engagement after a summer of speculation they were an item.
The game, Jen Saves Ben, features an animated Lopez breaking into a warehouse and saving Affleck, who has been chained to the wall.
The game is a gift from Jersey Girl director Kevin Smith
"J-Lo has to get him back but doesn't know where he's gone," said Brad Graeber of Texas-based Powerhouse Animation Studios, which created the game.
The 1980s-style martial arts game features a soundtrack of Lopez's music as she karate-kicks her way to saving her fiance.
It features a computerised version of the director as the game's villain, Dr Smith, and Affleck's screenwriting partner Matt Damon as an evil robot.
Players have three lives to save Affleck, and if they do, the couple are seen kissing at the end of the game.
Affleck and Lopez recently announced their engagement but have not yet said when they will marry.
They met on the set of the film Gigli, in which Lopez plays a gangster.
Lopez has already been married twice, with her most recent marriage to dancer Chris Judd lasting only eight months.
Lopez also had a long relationship with hip hop mogul and chart star Sean "P Diddy" Combs.

Hosepipe bans call in South East
Drought-hit region needs water
Water companies in south-east England are being urged to bring in hosepipe bans to avoid the introduction of more extreme water-saving measures.
A report from the Environment Agency made the recommendation, saying the region was in a "serious situation".
The period from October 2004 to January 2006 was the driest in some parts of the South East since 1921.
Rainfall has been low across most of England and Wales, but the south of England has been the driest area.
Graph of rainfall totals 2004-06 against UK average rainfall
The Environment Agency and the Consumer Council for Water have both said they are more concerned about shortages in the South East than anywhere else in the country.
Four out of the nine water firms in the South East already have some form of hosepipe ban.
Sutton and East Surrey Water has restrictions on sprinklers and unattended hosepipes.
Southern Water is enforcing a hosepipe and sprinkler ban across its supply area, except in Hampshire.
South East Water is banning the use of hosepipes in its Sussex and west Kent supply areas.
Mid Kent Water also has a hosepipe ban in place.
The Environment Agency appealed for similar action to be taken, from early April at the latest, by Thames Water, Folkestone and Dover Water, Portsmouth Water, Essex and Suffolk Water and Three Valleys Water, which supplies customers across north Surrey, north London, Hertfordshire and Essex.
Standpipes possibility
Agency chief executive Barbara Young said both water supplies and the environment were at risk.
"There is still time for rain this winter and spring to reduce the risk of drought, but water companies shouldn't just hope for rain - they must act now in case the weather stays dry," she said.
"If they delay introducing hosepipe bans, extreme steps to manage water supplies over the summer may be needed, such as standpipes and rota cuts."

Compulsory water meters would encourage better domestic use of water Phil J, London
Send us your comments
From October 2005 up to 20 February, south-east England received about 280mm of rainfall, 100mm less than the average for the period.
An Environment Agency spokeswoman said: "We need a lot more to make water resources safe.
"Any rain will help and we're at the right time of the year for rain to have the best possible impact on water resources.
"[But] we're still a long way from the drought being over."
Environment minister Elliot Morley said compulsory water meters were one option for saving water but that there was a stronger case for introducing this in areas of need such as southern England, rather than a national scheme.
Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker said compulsory meters would play a vital role in managing resources in the future.
