Blasts kill 37 in India graveyard
Scores were wounded in the blasts after Friday prayers
At least 37 people have been killed in bombings at a Muslim graveyard in western India, authorities say.
More than 125 others were hurt in the explosions after Friday prayers in Malegaon. The hospital in the town says 20 of them are in a serious condition.
State police chief PS Pasricha said a curfew had been imposed and police reinforcements sent to the town.
It is not clear what caused the blasts as Muslims left prayers. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has led calls for calm.
Prayer day
No group has said it carried out the blasts in Malegaon, which is in Nashik district about 260km (160 miles) north-east of Maharashtra's state capital, Mumbai. Patients were brought to our hospital and we treated some of them and sent the rest to other hospitals
LN Chauhan, Wadia hospital In pictures: Attack aftermath Eyewitness: Blast carnage The blasts come days after Mr Singh told the country there were intelligence warnings of attacks. In July a series of explosions killed more than 180 people in Mumbai.
Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, RR Patil, told journalists there had been three blasts in Malegaon and not two as earlier reported. The explosions inside the town's main burial ground for Muslims happened on Shab-e-Barat - the day Muslims pray for their dead.
Officers were investigating reports explosives were packed on bicycles.
One witness, Shaiq, told Indian television: "I was finishing my Friday prayers when I heard the explosions... there was chaos everywhere. I saw three or four bodies and blood all over. People were running all over."
A curfew was imposed in many parts of the town, including the area where the blasts had taken place. Police said the situation was tense but under control. Angry crowds had pelted officers with stones after the blast. US 'shock'
Manmohan Singh was swift to condemn the blasts and has appealed for calm. Home Minister Shivraj Patil promised the government would deal firmly with the "terrorists" behind the attack.
He said: "The main design is not only to injure and kill innocent people... but to see that different sections of society clash and create more difficulties, more turmoil and more bloody situations."
A home ministry official in Delhi said central security forces, including personnel from the anti-riot Rapid Action Force, were being sent to Malegaon.
US ambassador David Mulford said he was "shocked and saddened by the brutal terrorist bombings" and that the US stood "with India in its fight against terrorism".
The Chief Minister of Maharashtra state, Vilasrao Deshmukh, said 100,000 rupees ($2,100) would be paid in compensation to the families of each of the dead.
Muslim-majority Malegaon, which has a population of about 500,000 and a large community of weavers, is a town with a history of communal rioting.
Earlier this year, the police recovered a large cache of arms and explosives from the area.
In October 2001, violence in protest at the US attacks on Afghanistan left a total of 12 people dead in the town.

Vale player in meningitis scare
A rash is one of the symptoms of meningitis Port Vale defender Rae Ingram has been diagnosed with meningitis.
The 28-year-old is in an isolation ward at a hospital in Telford after falling ill last week.
The rest of the Port Vale squad has been tested for meningitis, but a spokesman for the club said they were satisfied it had not spread.
The player should find out on Tuesday whether he has the viral or bacterial strain of the illness.
Ingram, who has been out injured for much of this season, could face a recovery period of up to three months.

'Tricked' into nerve gas tests
Leading Aircraftman Ronald Maddison died at the base in 1953
The government can challenge an inquest verdict on the death of a serviceman who underwent nerve gas tests in 1953, the High Court has ruled. Ronald Maddison thought he was taking part in an experiment to find a cure for the common cold when he volunteered for defence tests at Porton Down, his family believe.
But within an hour of the trials - in which he was exposed to the nerve agent sarin - the 20-year-old RAF engineer was dead.
At the time, to protect national security, Mr Maddison's father agreed only to say his son's death was "an unfortunate accident while on duty".
For similar reasons the original inquest was held in secret. It ruled he died of asphyxia.
But the Leading Aircraftman's family and other servicemen always maintained he had been tricked into volunteering for the 1953 trials.
In November 2004 a second inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
But the Ministry of Defence has now been given leave by a High Court judge to prepare a challenge to that verdict.
Another judge will decide whether there will be a full hearing on the MoD's challenge, after considering written arguments from all sides. LAC Maddison and five others were exposed to sarin, a lethal chemical agent, while inside a sealed gas chamber. Alfred Thornhill saw Mr Maddison convulsing
The volunteers had been tempted by a notice which made assurances they would come to no harm and receive payment of 15 shillings (75p).
After LAC Maddison's death - the first in trials at the Wiltshire laboratories - experiments ceased.
His sister, Lilias Craik, said: "We knew nothing about how he died. We thought it could have been an accident, we knew he had volunteered for something, but we didn't know what."
The campaigners' calls were finally answered in 2002 when a new inquest was ordered by a High Court judge.
During that second hearing ex-army ambulance driver Alfred Thornhill - who was called to help LAC Maddison - described how he found him convulsing and foaming at the mouth. "He was taken into the medical centre where there were scientists and medical people," he said.
"They just threw him onto the bed and gave him a big injection.
It was a terrible atmosphere - they were all panicking. They couldn't handle what they were looking at
Alfred Thornhill
"It was a terrible atmosphere - they were all panicking. They couldn't handle what they were looking at."
Claims were made by Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who was commissioned by the Ministry of Defence to write a chapter of the Porton Down Historical Survey, that the trials went too far.
The leading expert in ethics told the inquest that volunteers' surface skin fat content was critical in the effect sarin could have on them - a factor not fully understood by scientists in the 1950s.
It was discovered after Mr Maddison's death that his skin fat was "practically absent" - a key factor in his death, according to the professor.
The hearing also heard from historian John Harding who examined official documents but found no link between experiments at Porton Down and a cure for the common cold.
At a hearing on April 19, the MoD argued that the coroner in the second inquest was wrong to allow the jury the option of a verdict of "unlawful killing by reason of unlawful act manslaughter".
Mr Justice Collins said it was impossible to say that such a point was not arguable. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Berti Vogts wants Fifa action over Nigeria unpaid wages
By Ibrahim Sannie
Berti Vogts was sacked by Nigeria after the African Cup of Nations in 2008
Coach Berti Vogts has returned to Fifa to ask the governing body to act on Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)'s refusal to pay monies owed him.Despite the claim by the former Eagles coach, NFF boss Sani Lulu insists the issue was resolved two days ago. Fifa ordered the NFF to pay the German an undisclosed amount four months ago as his unpaid wages during his stint as Nigeria coach. With the 30-day deadline elapsing by over eight weeks the NFF has still not paid the amount due Vogts, his lawyer Stefan von Moers claimed. The dispute now looks set to rumble on with Vogts taking the Nigerians to Fifa's disciplinary committee to take action. "We have no option but to return to Fifa to ask the disciplinary committee to act on the Nigerian FA's refusal to pay up," Moers told BBC Sport. "Fifa ruled in our favour way back in December and its now eight weeks since that ruling and we have heard nothing from the Nigerians." Even though Moers claims that the money has not been paid, Lulu is confident the NFF will not be trouble with Fifa's disciplinary committee. He says the stand-off arose because they got the wrong account details of the German which led to the delay in payment. "I don't think we are in trouble with Fifa. The issue was solved two days ago so when the coach checks his account he will see the money," Lulu told BBC Sport. "The initial account number we had for Vogts was wrong and it took some time for the bankers to get back to us as it a foreign transaction. "We got the correct bank account two days ago and we have sent the money to his account so there should be no problems." Fifa confirmed that they ruled in favour of Vogts after he reported the NFF for ending his con tract early without paying him off. The German was fired after the Super Eagles dismal showing at the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations with three months left on his contract. "We can confirm that based on a claim from the German coach Berti Vogts against the Nigeria Football Federation, the Single Judge of the FIFA Players' Status Committee passed a decision in the matter on 10 December 2009," a Fifa spokesman told BBC Sport. "The findings of the decision were formally notified to the parties on 16 December 2009. "An amount corresponding to certain unpaid wages was awarded to the coach." Vogts, who is the current coach of Azerbaijan, led his native Germany to the European title in 1996.

Walker raring to get going
Leicester City goalkeeper Ian Walker says he is in good shape and raring to go for the new season after being part of England's Euro 2004 squad.
Walker did not play in any matches but was one of three keepers on the party.
He told BBC Radio Leicester: "I've done a lot of training when I was out in Portugal when I was with England.
"Since then I've been on holiday and kept my fitness ticking over. I am feeling great and cannot wait for the new season to start."

Renault drive chance for Grosjean
Frenchman Romain Grosjean will drive for Renault for the rest of the season
Renault have confirmed that Romain Grosjean will replace Nelson Piquet Jr at the European Grand Prix in Valencia.Grosjean has also been chosen as the team's second driver for the remaining races of the season after Piquet Jr failed to pick up a point in 10 races. "I'm very proud and looking forward to helping the team get the best results," said the 23-year-old Frenchman. "Romain is an impressive young talent and we expect him to show his skills," said Renault team boss Flavio Briatore. Grosjean will race alongside two-time world champion Fernando Alonso for Renault in Valencia at the weekend after getting the green light to replace Piquet Jr. "It is an honour to be Fernando's team-mate and to make my Formula 1 debut alongside a double world champion is especially motivating," said Grosjean.
606: DEBATE
It must have been a nervous day for Grosjean, knowing he had the race seat if Renault were reinstated The Legend that is PhilSlocombe
Briatore thanked the Brazilian for his efforts in a team statement but said the switch was evidence that the team would "take an aggressive approach to the second half of the season". Renault were reinstated on Monday for this weekend's race in Valencia after successfully appealing a one-race ban they were given at the Hungary Grand Prix. The French team were punished after allowing Fernando Alonso to leave the pit lane with a loose wheel, which then came off, at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
Alonso loses his front wheel
However, Alonso will now be able to race at his home grand prix this weekend after the ban was overturned. Motorsport's governing body (FIA) will instead fine Renault £30,000. The decision to allow Alonso and his new Renault team-mate to race is likely to delight the Spanish crowd. "The reason there are two races in Spain is largely because of Fernando's involvement," said Renault team manager Steve Nielsen. "People in Spain were not so interested in F1 until he got involved, and now it's a big sport there." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Edinburgh 21-12 Blues
Edinburgh winger Tim Visser was a threat all evening at Murrayfield
Edinburgh (13) 21Tries: Rennie, Thompson Pens: Paterson 3 Cons: Paterson Blues (6) 12 Pens: Sweeney 3, Halfpenny
Edinburgh recovered from a recent slump in form to ease to victory over the sorry Blues in the Magners League.The visitors faded after a promising start and trailed 13-6 at the break after Ross Rennie crashed in a try. Full-back Jim Thompson added another touchdown early in the second half, finishing off a neat passing move. Yellow cards for Fraser McKenzie and Roddy Grant saw Edinburgh lose their way but the Welsh side lacked the guile to take advantage in a scrappy contest. The win lifts Edinburgh to third in the table, while the Blues, who have lost all five of their away games this season, stay in eighth spot. On a bitterly cold evening at Murrayfield, the team from Cardiff made most of the early running but had to settle for an exchange of penalties between Ceri Sweeney and Edinburgh skipper Chris Paterson, leaving the scores tied at 6-6. However, Edinburgh, who had failed to score a try in their last four outings, went in ahead at the halfway stage thanks to some inspired play from stand-off Rory Hutton, making his league debut. The 22-year-old skipped through a number of challenges with the help of a fabulous dummy and, as he was hauled down just short of the line, popped a pass to flanker Rennie to flop over from close range, with Paterson adding the conversion. The second half was just two minutes old when Edinburgh added a second try. Thompson and winger Tim Visser combined at pace and the flying Dutchman offloaded for the full-back to sail over for a simple touchdown. This time Paterson was guilty of a rare miss with the boot. The Blues rallied briefly and Andy Powell led a surge on the Edinburgh line but it was the impressive Roddy Grant who stole the ball, burst free and cleared the danger. The home side continued to look the more likely and Allan Jacobsen barrelled through on a 40-yard burst only for the experienced prop to run out of steam. As the final quarter approached Leigh Halfpenny surged from full-back, collected his own kick and won a penalty which he duly converted, while Sweeney trimmed the gap further when he slotted his third penalty in the 64th minute. Edinburgh made life more difficult than it ought to have been, losing McKenzie, then Grant, to foolish yellow cards but Paterson's penalty with twelve minutes left denied Cardiff a losing bonus point and steadied the home ship. Edinburgh head coach Rob Moffat: "We were pleased to get a win but I think we should have won by more.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "At 18-6, if we had been playing really well, we might have got another couple of tries and a bonus point. That's what we should be aiming for. "But we gave them chances to come back into the game by conceding penalties for some reason." Cardiff Blues director of rugby Dai Young: "To come away from Edinburgh with nothing is hugely disappointing. "We should have at least come away with a losing bonus point but to be quite honest we blew it. "We've got to start nailing these wins. We've got to stop talking about it and just do it." Edinburgh: Paterson, Thompson, Cairns, Houston, Visser, Hutton, Laidlaw, Jacobsen, Ford, Young, C. Hamilton, MacLeod, MacDonald, Rennie, R.
