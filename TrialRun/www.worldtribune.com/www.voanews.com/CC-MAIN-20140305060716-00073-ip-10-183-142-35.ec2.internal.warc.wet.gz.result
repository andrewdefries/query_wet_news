September 05, 2012
CAIRO — Egypt's president has made an impassioned plea to fellow Arab leaders to bring an end to the bloodshed in Syria.
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi urged Arab leaders to make ending the conflict in Syria the region's top priority.
"Any talk of developing the Arab world's work, and building our shared future, cannot gain the momentum we want in reality as long as the Syrian people's suffering continues,” Morsi said.
Making his first appearance as president before the Arab League Wednesday, Morsi outlined his plan for a regional quartet -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran -- to work toward a negotiated settlement. He also repeated his call for the Syrian government to step down.
"There is still a chance to stop the bloodshed. There is no room for pride or bidding. Don't listen to the voices that tempt you to stay because you will not be here for long,” Morsi said.
Syria's information minister this week rejected Mr. Morsi's effort, dismissing him as a stooge of the United States and Israel.
But in Cairo, Syrian opposition members who have been holding vigil outside the Arab League welcomed Mr. Morsi's plan in general.
Activist Nawras el Sag said he was delighted -- but with reservations.
“This is the first time an Arab leader said something we value. But we wished for more. He could at least talk about the channel that distributes arms to Syria from Iran. He should have said it needs to be closed," el Sag said.
El Sag also questioned Mr. Morsi's plan to include Iran in the talks, given Tehran's support for the Syrian government.
"Women, young ladies, the elderly, are all killed by Iran. It is our enemy and we regard it the same as Bashar ((al-Assad)), our number one enemy," El Sag said.
Activist Khalil el Kordi, though, held out hope that including Iran could help stop the bloodshed.
“Iran should take a stance on the grounds that it works by honor, in accordance with Islam, work by its religion. Simply, today, a Muslim should not kill a Muslim,” el Kordi said.
Morsi's plan coincides with a joint effort by the Arab League and the United Nations to send a new special envoy to Syria. But few on either side of the conflict, or among those trying to bring it to an end, predict either mission will bring about any change soon.

He, therefore, became a nerdy head of state by ancestry, and subsequently he proved himself to be nothing more than an inept head of state. Despite his ophthalmology pedigree, Assad has been blind of the changing landscape the Arab Springs have brought about in Middle east. Now his country has turned into a slaughterhouse, and its infrastructure has turned into rubble. But is still as inept as he was in 2000, and he believes that he can survive the onslaught of the Syrian Arab Spring with the support of Russia, Iran, and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. History has it that "wickedness" destroyed the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah there. I believe Syria in on a similar path of destruction now. With hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, I wonder why a loony leader would continue the slaughter of his people to keep the job of the president that he has not earned!

To both China and Russia, succession to the presidency remains an exclusive preserve of the ruling family. Therefore any attempt to remove the power from it is seen as an affront. Both are used to the oligarchic and antiquated monarchic system wherein there still exists lords, barons and serfs. In the Chinese system only the ruling class matters, the rest are slaves that should have no input to how they are ruled. Even though they make a show of electioneering, they are only mimicking the established orders without a serious meaning to following or adopting it. That is why the deaths in Syria mean nothing to them, until perhaps one belonging to the ruling class is affected.

There is no denying that the opinion that the goverment dominates the community exists, but many people are trying really hard to assert their rights.
