One group that's picking up the pieces after the election is the Tea Party. Host Michel Martin talks to Tea Party Patriots' Shelby Blakely about what went wrong, and what's next for Tea Party activists.
Copyright © 2012 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE, from NPR News. Coming up, we're hearing a lot about the so-called fiscal cliff: those automatic spending cuts and tax hikes that will take effect if lawmakers and the White House don't come up with a deficit reduction plan by the end of the year. We're going to focus on a tax hike that may hit many more people than you might think. We'll have that conversation in just a few minutes. But first, we're talking once again with people we call the loyal opposition, asking what they expect and hope for in the next four years. Yesterday, we heard perspective from a progressive voice, the former advocate turned Obama administration official turned advocate Van Jones. Today, we want to hear from a voice from the Tea Party movement. After triumph in the midterm elections in 2010, where they were widely credited with returning the House to Republican control, the movement is now reflecting on this year's election night drubbing. Tea Party favorites like Congressman Joe Walsh from Illinois lost his reelection bid. Congressman Allen West is behind in his reelection bid, although he has not yet conceded. And, of course, the Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan won back his seat in the Congress, but couldn't carry the bigger prize as Mitt Romney's running mate, and couldn't even carry his home state. So we wanted to know more about what people in the Tea Party think they should do now. We're joined now by Shelby Blakely. She's the journalist coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots, and she's with us from time to time to offer perspective. Shelby, thanks so much for joining us once again. SHELBY BLAKELY: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: You were saying earlier that last Tuesday was a bad night for the Tea Party. We mentioned some of the races that didn't go well for Tea Party standard-bearers. What do you think were some of the critical factors in those outcomes? BLAKELY: Well, this election was a congruence of quite a few events. Both sides received fewer votes in the popular count than the 2008 election. That took everybody by surprise. And there's also a lot of Tea Party candidates, or candidates that support Tea Party values, that were openly targeted by far-left PACs and other organizations. And those representatives, we're hearing widespread reports of the fact that the GOP establishment in those states gave them no support. Joe Walsh is a good example of that, Michele Bachmann. Allen West is also a good example of that. MARTIN: So wha

< The Key To Disaster Survival? Friends And Neighbors
July 04, 2011 3:39 PM
Copyright ©2011 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MICHELE NORRIS, host: It seems as though there have been a lot of disasters recently - the earthquake in Japan, tornadoes in places like Missouri and Alabama, and those wildfires, to name just a few. With each of those disasters, we hear a lot about the emergency personnel, equipment and ambulances that are rushed to the scene. But new research shows there's something more important than rescue crews and government aid. NPR science correspondent Shankar Vedantam reports that what really matters are neighbors. SHANKAR VEDANTAM: When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, one victim was political scientist Daniel Aldrich. He had just moved to New Orleans. Late one night, there was a knock on his door. Professor DANIEL ALDRICH (College of Liberal Arts, Purdue University): It was a neighbor who knew that we had no idea of the realities of the Gulf Coast life, and knocked on our door very late at night - on Saturday and said: Look, you've got small kids. You should really leave. VEDANTAM: Officials hadn't ordered everyone out, but Aldrich trusted his neighbor. He bundled his family into a car and drove to Houston. Prof. ALDRICH: Without that information, we never would have left. I think we would have been trapped. VEDANTAM: In fact, by the time people were told to leave, thousands got stuck. Aldrich thought about how his neighbor had helped him, and asked himself: Is it possible neighbors play a decisive role during all disasters? As a researcher, he decided to find out. In Indian villages hit by the 2004 tsunami, Aldrich found that villagers who fared best weren't those with the most money, or the most power. They were the people who knew lots of other people.
