< Bob Woodruff and Wife Pen Recovery Memoir
February 28, 200711:03 AM
Copyright ©2007 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. RENÉE MONTAGNE, host: A little more than a year ago, ABC News' Bob Woodruff had reached the pinnacle of his career. He was one of two people chosen to succeed Peter Jennings in the "World News Tonight" anchor chair. Bob Woodruff had less than a month in that coveted job before he and his cameraman were gravely wounded in a roadside bombing attack while reporting in Iraq. Thirteen months after that attack, he and his wife Lee have written about his injuries and his healing in a memoir called "In an Instant." The Woodruffs came to our New York studio to talk about it, and I asked Bob Woodruff what he remembers about the attack. Mr. BOB WOODRUFF (Former Anchor, ABC News): I remember now some of the moments before we got hit by this IED. That we were driving down a street, and right before the explosion went off we were told by one of the Iraqi drivers that this looked like an area that was a little bit more dangerous for IED, for bombs. And we were just about ready to get down back inside the tank when this thing blew up. MONTAGNE: And the thing was a huge bomb filled with rocks. Mr. WOODRUFF: And those rocks flew into the side of my neck, side of my head, and crushed the back of my shoulder. And then that's when I went out. I passed out for about a minute, and during that minute one of the things that I do remember was seeing my body just floating below me in whiteness. After that I woke up and then Vinnie Malhotra, who is my producer was then - helped saving my life by holding onto my neck where there was blood coming out of my neck. And he's blocking it off with his finger. Where the helmet was, there was blood coming out of that area as well. INSKEEP: I'm going to turn to you now, Lee, because you flew in to Germany where, Bob Woodruff, you'd been transported to a military hospital there. And you describe your husband Bob's injuries in terms that are, actually, makes you feel almost physical pain to read. Ms. LEE WOODRUFF (Wife of Bob Woodruff): Well, we knew that Bob had a - I guess we knew the term traumatic brain injury that point in time. It was a term I had never heard before all of this. And we were brought into the room - myself and Bob's brother, David. And the nurse took us around to Bob's, quote, unquote, "good side." Because he'd been sitting on the left side of the tank, most of his injuries were on the left side of his body. So I remember looking at his body sort of starting with the feet and working my way up to what I knew was going to be a horror show at the top of his head. And I got up to his good side and it looked like him with some cuts. And then I walked around on the other side of him and it was like being on the other side of the moon. The most horrifying thing to see was the giant 14-centimeter hole that had been cut out of the top of his skull to allow his brain to swell out of it. And the top
