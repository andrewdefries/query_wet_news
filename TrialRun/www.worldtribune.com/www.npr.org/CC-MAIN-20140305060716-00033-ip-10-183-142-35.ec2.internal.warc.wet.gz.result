It's ScuttleButton Time!
by Ken Rudin
April 19, 2013 6:15 AM
Ken Rudin collection Hopefully, the disappointment/frustration of that April Fool's ScuttleButton has subsided and now you're ready for the real stuff. ScuttleButton, of course, is that once-a-week waste of time exercise in which each Monday or Tuesday I put up a vertical display of buttons on this site. Your job is to simply take one word (or concept) per button, add 'em up, and, hopefully, you will arrive at a famous name or a familiar expression. (And seriously, by familiar, I mean it's

Isagani Serrano/International Rice Research Institute Genetically modified to be enriched with beta-carotene, golden rice grains (left) are a deep yellow. At right, white rice grains. Isagani Serrano/International Rice Research Institute
There's a kind of rice growing in some test plots in the Philippines that's unlike any rice ever seen before. It's yellow. Its backers call it "golden rice." It's been genetically modified so that it contains beta-carotene, the source of vitamin A. Millions of people in Asia and Africa don't get enough of this vital nutrient, so this rice has become the symbol of an idea: that genetically engineered crops can be a tool to improve the lives of the poor. It's a statement that rouses emotions and sets off fierce arguments. There's a raging, global debate about such crops. But before we get to that debate, and the role that golden rice plays in it, let's travel back in time to golden rice's origins. It began with a conversation in 1984.

Scientists were just figuring out how to find genes and move them between different organisms.

Next year, the NCAA goes to a four-team playoff format. So we can all look forward to arguments in the future about whether the teams ranked 5, 6, 7 and 8 should have been included. Then there's the story line about Florida State
