"A Rational Conversation" is a column by writer Eric Ducker in which he gets on iChat or Gchat or the phone or whatever with a special guest to examine a music-related subject that's entered the pop culture consciousness. It previously appeared at The Daily Swarm. Follow the scuttlebutt and jibber jabber on the music internet and it sounds like emo — the broadly defined, male-dominated, compositionally complicated, often pained offshoot of American punk rock — is back. That's right, the beloved and maligned genre has been reinvigorated by new bands and new labels. (Though of course there are some who maintain that it never really left.) But what kind of emo has returned, exactly? And is it the beloved or the maligned parts? Most trace emo's roots back to an outgrowth of the Washington, D.C., hardcore scene of the 1980s, typified by the brief output of the groups Rites of Spring and Embrace (each of which featured one of the two men who would become Fugazi's vocalists, Guy Picciotto and Ian MacKaye). Emo then spread around the country (with a particularly strong showing in the Midwest) and the world in the '90s through the indie rock channels of the time, finding champions in acts like Seattle's Sunny Day Real Estate and Milwaukee's The Promise Ring. Vagrant Records acts like Dashboard Confessional and The Get Up Kids as well as Arizona's Jimmy Eat World helped popularize the sound in the beginning of the new century, leading to its total mainstreamification in the middle of that decade by huge bands like My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy and Panic! At the Disco. Ducker spoke with Brad Nelson, a writer living Queens whose work has appeared in publications including The Atlantic and Maura Magazine, about the current climate of this not particularly well understood genre and what we might get from new bands embracing emo. ERIC DUCKER: Are people excited about an "emo revival"? Is it due? Is it too soon? BRAD NELSON: From the shows I've been to, whether for reunions of mid-'90s bands or for current practitioners, the crowds are both ecstatic and contemplative. It's kind of strange, because most of the styles being resurrected are only about 14 years gone at this point. But I went to Texas Is the Reason's first reunion show last year and the crowd was about equally young and old, to the point where you got the sense that some of the kids in attendance were born only a few years before Do You Know Who You Are? came out. It's hard to say whether it's due. It seems that right at the start of the '00s emo altered into something very different, so personally I find this very deliberate re-visitation of a lot of the styles that seemed to shrink away or disappear entirely very endearing. There's an odd comfort to the idea of people picking up where others left off. It's not quite nostalgia, but it's not 100 percent not-nostalgia. What you seem to be saying is that emo was going in one direction through the '90s and then in the early '00s something else became known as emo — bands like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy — so this new wave of bands we're seeing now is more like an alternate universe of '00s emo. It's what could (or should, depending on who you ask) have happened after '90s emo. That's the feeling I get from the new bands out there. Also a lot of people — basically anybody in the comments section of any piece about "emo revival," so I'm sort of setting up a strawman here — will go out of their way to make the "mall emo"-era of Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance and others completely distinct from what was going on in the '90s and what's happening now, but I don't think that's entirely true. The early Fall Out Boy records, for instance, tried to be almost synth-less facsimiles of Get Up Kids records, but ended up weird and pop-oriented because Patrick Stump is such a flexible songwriter. It's the same with MCR, whose first record was produced by Geoff Rickly [of Thursday] and is this shambolic straightforward screamo thing before the group really embraced its theatrical aspects. It's all part of a lineage. Sorry, that's kind of a tangent. What I'm saying is that a lot of these bands probably like a few Fall Out Boy records. Part of the issue is that when people who aren't or weren't super into emo hear about an emo revival, they don't exactly know what to expect. Will it be the original Rites of Spring stuff out of D.C.? Will it be indie '90s bands like Promise Ring and Braid? Will it be wounded like Dashboard Confessional? Will it be the more pop-oriented like MCR and Fall Out Boy? I remember when people used to say that Bright Eyes was emo. That murkiness differentiates the emo revival a bit from other revivals. If you hear a new band has a traditional punk sound, you fill in New York or English acts from the late '70s; if they're hip-hop revivalists it's probably a Golden Era early-'90s vibe; if it's classic house you associate that with the cathartic '80s Chicago songs. Yeah! The genre endured a lot of dramatic shapeshifts over a relatively short amount of time, and different audiences fastened to different embodiments. Not that house or hip-hop didn't experience similar quicksilver evolutions; I guess with those it's just easier to perceive a foundation, whereas emo is sort of already an aerial evolution of hardcore. There's also maybe less allegiance to a core aesthetic among emo listeners. There are always Minor Threat or Black Flag fans that think of those bands as forming some essential fabric of hardcore from which further bands are sort of more compromised translations. Maybe I've just never encountered someone who thinks of Embrace and Rites of Spring in the same way. The music was always sort of immediately changeable. “ The records one should celebrate and the records one should be embarrassed by shift and even change places all the time.
There isn't that "true school" ideal for emo. Yeah, although people will often attempt to make Sunny Day Real Estate some kind of talisman. I just don't think it works. Not to mention that Sunny Day Real Estate themselves put

Beneath NPR's Poll, The 'Tyranny Of Constituency'
by Ron Elving
June 18, 2010 8:52 AM
hide captionChanging who gets to serve inside the Capitol isn't simple.
J. Scott Applewhite/AP
A poll NPR reported earlier this week offered the most telling metrics we've seen yet for measuring the mountain that congressional Democrats face this fall. It got a lot of attention for all the obvious reasons. But there's a good deal more to be gleaned from the numbers than the headline about a likely boost for Republicans.You can find in the results explanations for everything from Rep. Joe Barton's apology to BP this week to the passage of a "top two" primary system in California the week before. The poll also explains much else about contemporary American politics. People responded to the NPR poll because it focused only on the House districts at risk and told a clear numerical story about them. It's one thing to say voters are restless and that Democrats have a bull's-eye on their backs. It's another to pinpoint just how restless those voters are — and whom they blame — in exactly those districts where the November war for the House will be won and lost. How many districts is that? Just 70 of the 435 districts nationwide, or roughly 1 in 6 (the list of districts is here). Think that's an awfully narrow slice of the total national pie? Wonder why we ignored the other five-sixths of the country? Read on. Cyber-Modeled Districts Beneath the surface, the NPR poll was all about the tyranny of constituency, the down and dirty of serving the folks back home. House districts (and states' legislative districts) tend to be intricately drawn demarcations of the folks back home. From a complicated map of a state or a metro area, computer-enabled experts carve out jigsaw puzzle pieces that aggregate like-minded voters (and exclude those with different views). The dynamics of these cyber-modeled districts are the driving force of the House as we know it. As someone once said, where you stand depends on where you sit. And these days you can learn more about where a member of Congress sits than ever before.That’s why the NPR survey, done by Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg and Republican counterpart Glen Bolger, focused on the 60 Democratic districts likeliest to be lost to Republicans this fall. These are districts where incumbents are retiring, or where incumbents were most recently elected by narrow margins. In most, the 2008 voting that sent a Democrat to Congress also produced more votes for Republican presidential nominee John McCain tha
