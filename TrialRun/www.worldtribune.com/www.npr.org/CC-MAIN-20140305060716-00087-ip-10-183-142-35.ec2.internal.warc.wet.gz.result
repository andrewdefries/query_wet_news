Developed in the 1800s by West African slaves in Brazil, the art of capoeira is a complex and powerful mix of martial arts fighting, dance, music and games. Carlton Jones took part in a New York performance honoring Black History Month.
Copyright © 2008 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. ALISON STEWART, host: Capoeira is a martial art that looks like a dance, originates from Brazil, and was developed by slaves who meshed dance with fighting practice to fool their masters. Capoeira is still practiced and performed today, and for some, it's a symbolic resistance to oppression, and it's found residence in parts of African-American culture here in the U.S. Carlton Jones is a member of a capoeira group here in New York called ABADA, and the group held a special performance recently in honor of February's Black History Month. STEWART: Tell me about the first time that you saw someone performing capoeira. Mr. CARLTON JONES (Member, ABADA): Sure. The first time I saw capoeira was actually at the Joyce Theater. It was capoeira Brazil, actually, which the -using capoeira as a part of the program of the night, but it - that small portion of the program was completely captivating to me. And I remember distinctly, because I've never seen it before and I've never seen anything like it and was instantly amazed and just in a trance. STEWART: And as I understand it, your group held a performance earlier this month - February is Black History Month, and there was a performance that was dedicated to that month and the celebration of the African-American experience. This is a Brazilian art form, martial art. Mr. JONES: Yeah. STEWART: What's the connection with African-American experience? Mr. JONES: Well, it's a Brazilian art form, but it was born out of oppression. I mean, it was originated from the African slaves, as you know, in Brazil. And I think black history is black history, whether it's from America or from Africa or from Brazil, wherever in the world, black people have a unity of some sort that connects their history. And being that it was born out of oppression, I think it actuall

< The Fight To Desegregate Ole Miss, 50 Years Later
September 28, 201212:00 PM
Copyright ©2012 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST: This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, we bring you up to date with the latest news on stories we've covered and we'll get your thoughts about some of them. That's BackTalk in just a few minutes. But, first, we mark an important anniversary in civil rights history. Fifty years ago this weekend, chaos broke out at the University of Mississippi, also known as Ole Miss, after an African-American man named James Meredith attempted to enroll. The violence erupted despite a court order that Meredith be admitted and despite President John F. Kennedy's plea to students and citizens to comply. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO) PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY: The honor of your university and state are in the balance. I am certain the great majority of the students will uphold that honor. There is, in short, no reason why the books on this case cannot now be quickly and quietly closed in the manner directed by the court. Let us preserve both the law and the peace. HEADLEE: The president ended up sending more than 20,000 troops to restore order after a mob clashed with federal marshals. James Meredith went on to become the first African-American to graduate from Ole Miss. To mark the 50th anniversary of Meredith's enrollment, I'm joined by James Meredith's niece, Meredith McGee. She's the author of an upcoming book titled "James Meredith: Warrior and the America that Made Him." Also with us, Professor Frank Lambert. He teaches history at Purdue University and wrote the book "The Battle of Ole Miss: Civil Rights v. States' Rights." He was also a student at Ole Miss when James Meredith enrolled. Welcome to both of you. FRANK LAMBERT: Thank you. MEREDITH MCGEE: Thank you. HEADLEE: So, Meredith, what has your uncle told you about his initial decision to enroll at Ole Miss and how he came to that decision? MCGEE: I think, at first, he was inspired to go to Ole Miss as a young man when he was maybe 12. He saw a Ole Miss degree on the wall of his father's doctor and he wanted to go to that school before he even knew that he couldn't go because of segregation and I think that he was inspired even more when he was in the military. He came home on a furlough and the Little Rock Nine were integrating, of course, with a military force and that was the other thing. And then he was also inspired when John F. Kennedy gave his inauguration speech and he gave a civil rights platform that was - the day that he gave the speech is when he wrote his initial draft to become admitted into Ole Miss. HEADLEE: You know, Professor Lambert, you were there at the school at the time. I understand you played football and came out of your game to see all of this beginning to happen. Can you kind of describe it for us? LAMBERT: Well, I can. In 1962, I was a sophomore there and one of the interesting things to me, as I reflect on it now from the perspective of a historian, I wrote my letter to Ole Miss seeking admission in 1961, about the same time that James Meredith did. Of course, I did not know that at the time. Both of us received exactly the same letter from the registrar. We're pleased that you're interested in Ole Miss. Enclosed is an application. Fill it out, send it in. The difference, of course, is that I was white and James Meredith was black and, in 1961, that made all the difference in Mississippi. I was admitted without any question and, when he identified himself in a follow-up letter, saying you need to know that I am an American Mississippi Negro, that was it. That set in motion an institutionalized response from the governor on down to make sure that he was not admitted to the all-white university. HEADLEE: Well, let's take a listen. This is from September 29th of 1962 and the voice we're hearing here is the Mississippi governor at the time, Ross Barnett, giving a speech at halftime during your game. Let's hear a clip. LAMBERT: Oh, I remember it well. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO) GOVERNOR ROSS BARNETT: I love Mississippi. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING) BARNETT: I love her people. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING) BARNETT: Our customs. I love and I respect our heritage. HEADLEE: So, if you listen back to that without the context, it sounds relatively harmless, but back in 1962, there's an unspoken message there. Right, Frank? LAMBERT: Exactly. Context is everything. There wasn't a person in that stadium that had any misunderstanding of what he meant about heritage. He had been elected governor by pledging to
