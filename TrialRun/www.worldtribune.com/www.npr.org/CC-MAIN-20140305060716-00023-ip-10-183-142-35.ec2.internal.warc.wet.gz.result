The Musicians Welcome To Jay-Z's Brooklyn by Frannie Kelley

New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News via Getty Images Jay-Z plays the first of eight concerts at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on Friday, Sept. 28. New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News via Getty Images
Last Friday two things changed. The shifts weren't seismic, or unexpected, but now Brooklyn is different and hip-hop is different. It's because of Jay-Z, who, despite owning only 0.067% of the Nets and less than 0.2% of the Barclays Center, has become the public face of Brooklyn – not the team, the town. I live four blocks from the Barclays Center, the new home of Brooklyn's professional basketball team, transplanted from New Jersey, and a 19,000 seat concert venue. A couple of weeks ago I went out of town and the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues was the enormous construction site it has been for the past two and a half years, scaffolding spilling into the street causing midnight traffic jams. When I came back last week, there was an arena there. It looks like an alien shellfish, lit from within. The subway stop there has a different name. That intersection was unlovely before this whole project started, in 2003, and despite everything — the deployment of eminent domain, the demolishing of my second-favorite bar in the world, the billion dollars of NYC taxpayer money subsidizing the building and future development around it — I'm into it. My councilwoman, Letitia James, has criticized the development. In August she was quoted in the New York Times, saying of Jay-Z's investment, "Bringing in someone who grew up in public housing, with a rags-to-riches story, who could identify with Brooklyn and African-Americans, that was slick." I went to the first concert at the Barclays Center on Friday night — Jay-Z himself, on an eight-night stand. I took the subway over after work, and walked around the mini-mall across the street, past the Nets and the Rocawear stores that open onto Flatbush. There were so many wide-eyed people Instagraming in the vicinity of the building that cell service cut out. I swear to god I have never been asked to take so many people's picture before. Some of the crowd was already wearing black-and-white B's on their hats and T-shirts. And if that picks up — whether people adorning themselves in Brooklyn's colors are aligning themselves with Jay or the Nets or they just dig the logo and color scheme — everybody who put up millions to bring the Nets here gets paid. I think Councilwoman James is right — Jay-Z's origins, the way he reminds us of the circumstances he came up in and his unapologetic joy at living comfortably now, links him to this team and its home court more tightly than other celebrity musician investors in professional teams are tied to theirs: Will Smith to the Philadelphia 76ers, Gloria Estefan, Jennifer Lopez, Jimmy Buffet et al to the Miami Dolphins. What they're selling out in Brooklyn isn't an NBA team. They're selling Jay-Z's rags-to-riches story. And he's offering it up, at a lower price than you'd think. "I've been on many stages. Been all around the world," he said on Friday. "Nothing feels like tonight." The crowd broke out into a chant of "Brooklyn, Brooklyn." Jay sounded as incredulous as we felt. As he took a breath a lone voice wafted through the air, quoting the man of the evening: "You crazy for this one Jay!" He had composed a verse for the occasion that included the line, "No, really, I got shooters on my team!" "I grew up in Marcy Projects, which is about 15 minutes that way," said Jay, pointing in the correct direction, as noted by a dude in my row. The pre-show entertainment was radio DJ Mr. Cee, who reminded us that he grew up in Lafayette Gardens, which is half the distance to Marcy from where we were standing. Cee spun a good amount of Biggie's catalog to get us hype for the main event. He didn't play "Juicy," though — Jay called that one for himself, and just rhymed along to Biggie's track, like we all have, about a million times, and did again that night with thousands of our neighbors: "You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far." The culture has celebrated momentous achievements before, but Friday night felt like the farthest hip-hop had ever taken it. Jay said that everyone in the arena was from Brooklyn that night, but when Mr. Cee asked for the Bronx to stand up, then Queens, then Staten, then Manhattan, the hollering was spirited, but manageable. When he asked where Brooklyn was, the roof blew off. "It's our night tonight," said Mr. Cee. "They can't never say that Brooklyn cats don't have money." They used to say that. Brooklyn was not always a good place to be from. It did not always imply achievement, mastery, flyness. Remember Saturday Night Fever? The Brooklyn that calls Jay-Z its favorite son does not look like John Travolta's Brooklyn. And everybody who lives and works near the Barclays Center now has the opportunity to make money from it. Believe me, the parking garages did not hesitate to jack their prices up this week. A lady advertising her psychic services was handing out flyers in front of the arena and the vans that run up and down Flatbush more frequently (and more cheaply) than the public buses were full. Jay-Z's tiny percentages will pay off, though he won't make as much money as Mikhail Prokhorov, who owns most of the team, will. Or AEG, the company that operates the venue. Or Bruce Ratner, the developer who started this whole thing. He has proposed to build 16 mixed

Economy Manufacturing 2.0: Old Industry Creating New High-Tech Jobs

Parallels Venezualan Flights Are Dirt Cheap ... If You Can Get A Ticket
The good news is that air travel to and from Venezuela is dirt cheap due to the difference between the official cost of tickets and the black-market currency rate. The bad news is that many flights are booked up months in advance.
