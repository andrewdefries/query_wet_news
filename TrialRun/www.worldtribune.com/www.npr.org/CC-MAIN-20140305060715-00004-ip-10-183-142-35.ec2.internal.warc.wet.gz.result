Tuesday October 22, 1996
Russia's 'Sesame Street' October 22, 1996  NPR's Andy Bowers reports on Ulitsa Sezam, the Russian Courtyard that's home to Zeliboba and his friends - Vlas and Yenick, and Aunt Dashe. If this sounds familiar, it is. The Russian version of Sesame Street premiered today, brought to you by the letter Bukva. There was concern before the show made it to Russian airwaves that it might be just another unwanted import of American culture, although it's too soon to tell what public reaction is to the show.

Our Fascination With The End Of The World

As far back as 2800 B.C., the Assyrians warned that the end of the world was near. Mayans predicted the apocalypse for 2012. Jerry Walls of the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame talks about our ongoing fascination with the end of days.
Copyright © 2009 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. NEAL CONAN, host: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. And now this warning: "Our Earth is degenerate in these later days. There are signs that the world is speedily coming to an end, bribery and corruption are common, children no longer obey their parents, every man wants to write a book and the end of the world is evidently approaching." Ripped from the headlines? Well, only if they were published in cuneiform. The warning was inscribed on a clay tablet in ancient Assyria almost 5,000 years ago. Prophets have predicted that the end is nigh ever since, many with an exact date for their doomsday scenario. These days, some worry about December 21st, 2012, the last day on a calendar created by the ancient Mayans. But if that is the last day, will it end in fire or ice, a call to judgment, the dawn of a new golden age, the complete destruction of the Earth or a shift into higher consciousness? Why are we so fascinated with the end, whether we call that annihilation, entropy or the apocalypse? Now is your chance to summon your inner Nostradamus. Based on your beliefs and your values, how does your world end? 800-989-8255 is the phone number. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can join the conversation on our Web site, that's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program writer Peter Mehlman confesses that he reported for jury duty but finagled his way out of serving through a trial. If that's your story too, email us; talk@npr.org is that address again. But first, the end of days. You don't get to say that too often. Jerry Walls joins us from WSND on the campus of Notre Dame University where he is senior research fellow in Center for Philosophy of Religion. He's also the editor of the "Oxford Handbook of Eschatology." And thanks very much for being with us on the program today. Mr. JERRY WALLS (Senior Research Fellow, Center for Philosophy of Religion): Thank you Neal. I'm excited to be here. CONAN: Does every belief incorporate an end? Mr. WALLS: No, as a matter of fact, if you look at Hinduism, Buddhism, these views hold that there is no end of the world in the sense that there is in Christian eschatology, Jewish eschatology, Muslim eschatology, but rather a perpetual cycle of the world being manifest, declining - being manifest, going on forever and ever. It's been that way forever and it will continue to be that way forever. So, the only sense in which they would talk about an end would be the end of an individual person. So, you have kind of personal eschatology but no end of the world per se in the same sense of Jewish, Christian, Muslim eschatology. CONAN: And we throw that word eschatology around, what does that mean actually? Mr. WALLS: It's a word that comes from the Greek work eschatos, which means end and it is the branch of theology that deals with the end of the world: death, resurrection, final judgment and the like. CONAN: Nevertheless, with those exceptions noted, it does seem that leaves an awful lot for almost every other belief in human existence to... Mr. WALLS: Including a lot of modern secular naturalists who think the end of the world is going to come when all of the energy runs out, all the suns burn out, they project the world - this Earth to come to an end, say, five billion years from now when the sun becomes this huge, you know, red thing and encapsulates the Earth and destroy all of, you know, carbon-based life around here. And 10 to the 12 years later, all of the stars are going to reach that fate. So, naturalistic science would give us a rather bleak, dismal picture of the end of the world. CONAN: Entropy, I think, is the category that comes under. Mr. WALLS: Yeah, not an exciting prospect, entropy. CONAN: No. But I don't think anybody has worked it out to, you know, Tuesday, December 21st at 10:35 in the morning. Mr. WALLS: No, I don't think the scientists have given anything that specific. CONAN: Have you seen this new movie? Mr. WALLS: I have. Quite interesting film actually, yes. CONAN: And how closely does it follow the declarations of the Mayan calendar? Mr. WALLS: Well, I'm not sure, you know, a lot about the Mayan calendar but that is, of course, one of the big scenarios involved in the movie. And it certainly depicts the universe going to hell in a handbasket - well, not the universe per se, but Earth. CONAN: Our neighborhood. Mr. WALLS: Yes, our neighborhood going up in flames, and all of the distress and destruction that would entail. And science, at the end of the day, saves the world. Well, doesn't save the world, but saves humanity because the Chinese have the foresight to build these technological arks, these massive, big steel ships which can absorb the tsunami. And some very fortunate people get into those arks, and thus the hope that the human race will survive. CONAN: Well, that's - I guess, you didn't mean to give away the ending for those who haven't seen the movie. Mr. WALLS: Oh, I shouldn't have done that! Alas, my apologies. CONAN: Nevertheless, I think we can all... (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: �be sure that there will be another occasion for us to fork over $12 and buy a bucket of popcorn. Mr. WALLS: Exactly. CONAN: Does this actually embrace any particular eschatology as you're defining it? Mr. WALLS: No. It is curious though, there's a kind of a mad, crazed - there is always a mad, crazed prophet in these kind of movies... CONAN: Sure. Mr. WALLS: �that seems to realize what is going on apart from everybody else who is clueless and oblivious and the like. And he cites several sources of this - the Mayans - he even says the Bible even got it partly right, you know. So, he cites several sources, so you have a wide range of beliefs being reflected in this movie. You have people who pray, you have who are skeptical about prayer, you have all these different viewpoints represented in different characters. But the Mayan is simply one of the sources of the prophet's apparent insight as to the world's coming to an end in the way it does. CONAN: And we will draw no inference from the fact that the character who is the prophet who gets it more or less right happens to be a radio talk show host, so� (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. WALLS: That's right. Up on the mountains, I think, up in Yellowstone Park, yeah, carries out these exciting, ecstatic, eschatological proclamations. Yeah, he's quite a character. CONAN: Now, it has been - it seems to me the story of the beginning of the world almost demands a story of the end of the world, doesn't it? Mr. WALLS: Exactly. The way you understand the beginning of the world determines whether and how you think the world will come to an end. Now, the religions I mentioned earlier - Buddhism, Hinduism - think the world is eternal - doesn't have a beginning. Christian, Jewish and Muslim theology, of course, believe the world did have a beginning, that it was created. And if you think the world was brought into existence for a purpose, for a reason, then there is a determined end by the one who brought it into existence. So, if you think a kind of blind, purposeless, you know, kind of Big Bang is the beginning of the world, then Mother Nature is going to destroy us all. It's all going to just peter out into oblivion. We got here by chance, by accident and the like, and the story is going to come down that way. If by contrast the author of the story is an intelligent being who brought us into existence for a reason, for a purpose, he is going to tell a different kind of story; a different kind of narrative is going to unfold, a different kind of ending. So, I guess, the question in many ways is: Is life a comedy? Is it a tragedy? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. WALLS: And who are the ones telling the story? Who are the main players? Is it us, human beings? Is it Mother Nature? Is she the one that's going to write the story and end up being a cruel mother that, you know, destroys all of us, kills everyone at the end of the day? Is it a loving God, you know, or is it simply human beings have evolved and now they take over as the director of the story and they will determine how the story ends, and that is wide open? CONAN: And in that category - we'll get to calls in just a minute - but in that category, who are the eschatological comedians? Mr. WALLS: The eschatological comedians would be all of those who believe that the universe - the end of the story is going to come to a happy ending. So, again, Christian, Jewish, Muslim eschatology all would hold that truth, justice will finally prevail, that God's good purposes will indeed come to a successful end as we pray in the Lord's Prayer. Christians - it is interesting, we've just started the Season of Advent, you know, which is a word for waiting, in which Christians look forward to the birth of the Messiah, the coming of Christ. And the rest of the story is Christ has died, Christ has risen, Christ will come again. So, the Christian story is the Prince of Peace will come at the end of the day that he will bring peace to the world, that his good purposes will prevail, that our deepest longings and hopes for meaning and satisfaction and happiness can and will be satisfied. Now, it's interesting, some views, you know, kind of have the idea that what it's all about is the cessation of desire, killing desire, and the like, that's how you finally experience, you know, Nirvana or release from the cycle of rebirth and the like, whereas these views would hold that our deepest and best desires are not to be eradicated or eliminated, but rather, they will finally be fulfilled at the end of the day. So that's a very comedic end of the story. And Dante, of course, wrote the great book "The Divine Comedy," and that's the ultimate expression of that picture. CONAN: We're talking with Jerry Walls, a senior research fellow at the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame, author of "The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology." 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. How does your world end? Let's begin with Luke(ph), Luke with us from Boston. LUKE (Caller): Yes. CONAN: And how's the world going to end, bangs or whimpers, Luke? LUKE: The Lewis Mumford view of it, I suppose, kind of a degradation of the whole society, where our civilization has reached its pinnacle, as it has over time. Every time a civilization reaches its pinnacle, it has to downfall and spread back out into a nomadic sense, where we'd all just go right back to our caveman time, searching for new technologies. CONAN: Well, I can see that as sort of post-civilizational, but I guess it's not quite the end of the world. We would just be back to the hunter-gatherers we were, what, 15, 20,000 years ago. LUKE: Yes, sir, absolutely. Mr. WALLS: The latest decline. CONAN: Go ahead, Jerry. Mr. WALLS: Yeah, I was going to say: Is this the end of the world, or is it a decline inevitably to be followed by yet another rise into accomplishment and glory and the like? So kind of - some people have this view that there's this endless cycle of rise, decline, manifestation and the like, and again, it's not clear which the caller intended. Which of those did he intend? CONAN: Luke, did you have a choice there? I think Luke has left us. Anyway. I think he just left us with a bang, rather than a whimper. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Now, there was - during the period since the end of the Second World War up until now, there has been an increased interest in all of this since man has the ability, should he fumble egregiously, to destroy the world himself. Mr. WALLS: Right. That's part of what is so fascinating. I remember - my grandfather was a country preacher - and I remember him talking about some of the things in the "Book of Revelation" that were described there. He said he couldn't understand how those things could possibly take place, but once technology came into existence - television, mass communication, modern weaponry and warfare - all of those things that just seemed so hard to conceive suddenly seemed plausible. And so yes, I mean, given the enormous capabilities we now have for destruction, the notion that we could destroy the world, at least the planet Earth, seems very plausible. So that's a big part of why people are fascinated with it. And the Second World War brought an end to a great period of optimism. I mean, well, the First World War did, too, but between the two of those wars, lots of people had their optimism just beat out of them completely. And they are thus very often stuck with a very bleak, pessimistic picture of how the world is going to end. CONAN: At the movies, the end of the world comes with a giant asteroid or vindictive robots or nuclear armageddon. Here's your chance to summon you inner Nostradamus. What's your vision of the end of days? We'll get to more of your calls in a moment, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. We're talking with Jerry Walls, who edited "The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology." That's the study of the end of the world. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington, and we're talking today about the end of the world. Here's some emails that we've received, this from Paul(ph). I'm just waiting for the asteroid to hit. And then this from Linda(ph) in Charlotte, who channels T.S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men," not with a bang but a whimper. Caitlyn(ph) emails from San Francisco: I think one of my favorite end-of-days depictions is in "The Simpsons Movie," where they think they're going to die. Everyone in the church runs into the bar; everyone in the bar runs into the church, one of the funniest and most insightful scenes ev
