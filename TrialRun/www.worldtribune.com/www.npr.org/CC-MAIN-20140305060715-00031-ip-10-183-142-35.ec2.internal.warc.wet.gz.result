Debuting this weekend are the new movies Funny Games, Sleepwalking and Horton Hears a Who, an animated Seuss film that Metro's Daniel Holloway finds dazzling.

We need to turn our brains off and get entertained. So we're going to the movies. We have just got to make it through a little more radio show first. Daniel Holloway is here to help me do that film critic for the Metro Newspaper, hi Daniel. Mr. DANIEL HOLLOWAY (Movie Critic, Metro Newspaper): Hey! MARTIN: How are you doing? Mr. HOLLOWAY: I'm - I'm an Irish lush. MARTIN: You are? Mr. HOLLOWAY: No I'm not. I guess I am, my last name is Holloway. MARTIN: You should be. Do you like Guinness? Mr. HOLLOWAY: I like Guinness. MARTIN: Yes, me too. OK, anyway we digress, we'll drink Guinness later. But first we are going to talk about movies. Let's start with Funny Games... Mr. HOLLOWAY: Do we have to? MARTIN: Yes, we are going to - the trailer for this, I've seen it, it's freakish. Michael Haneke has made this movie before, apparently in Austria in '97, why is he making the same movie again? Mr. HOLLOWAY: It's - the movie is so nice he made it twice. I - you know that's a really good question. I was... MARTIN: Thanks. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOLLOWAY: In fact it was on you guys' blog the other day. There was a posting about this that Ian pointed out to me. And it was funny because it mentioned a review that was like, what could his motivation possibly be for making a shot-for-shot remake of a movie he made 11 years ago... MARTIN: Is it really that identical? Mr. HOLLOWAY: Yes, a shot-for-shot remake. I must confess I haven't seen the first one. But this is what I've heard, and, you know, I don't know beyond money or, you know, the glory of being proclaimed as the most disturbing director ever. MARTIN: Was the first one released in the U.S.? Mr. MARTINEZ: No it was a German film. I'm sorry, so yes it's a shot-for-shot remake of a German film that he made in 1997. This time around it stars Naomi Watts and Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, Brady Corbet and it's the most horrifying thing you'll see at the movies this year and that's not really a good thing. MARTIN: Oh! Interesting, OK let's hear a little bit about, this is a scene, here is Tim Roth and Naomi Watts being taunted by these young men. (Soundbite of movie "Funny Games") Mr. MICHAEL PITT (As Paul): OK, we bet - what time is it? Mr. PITT (As Paul): 8.40. <

< Janice Baird Debuts in a Troubled 'Tristan'
March 28, 2008 1:00 PM
Copyright ©2008 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MADELEINE BRAND, host: Back now with Day to Day. We all have this dream, well nightmare really, without warning We find ourselves in major life moment, let's say seating down for that final exam without studying, pitching in the World Series or how about this, on stage at the Metropolitan Opera, Act II of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde. Well, that last one actually happened to soprano Janice Baird two weeks ago. She stepped into role of Isolde, replacing diva Deborah Voigt who had been hit with stomach bug mid-performance and had to leave the stage right away. Luckily Baird has sung the part enough times that she was equal to the moment she replaced Voigt again this past Tuesday, and she's prepared to go on again tonight. And she joins me now. Welcome to the program. Ms. JANICE BAIRD (Actress, Isolde): Hi! BRAND: Well when will know if you are going on tonight? Ms. BAIRD: You just never know, as we've seen from past times, but I'm sure that Deborah's going to be quite fine. I'm hopeful that she is on the road to recovery and will be able to sing her performance tonight. BRAND: Well, let's back track a little, because this run of Tristan and Isolde has been afflicted with all sorts of problems, right? There have only been six of them, but something seems have gone wrong... Ms. BAIRD: Every performance. BRAND: Every performance Ms. BAIRD: Every performance we've had some incidents, yeah! B
