Germany's cannibalism-by-consent case: Possible human-rights claims

FINDLAWFOR THE PUBLIC Select a topicAutosBankruptcyConsumerCriminal LawDivorceEmploymentEstate PlanningFamilyImmigrationLandlord-TenantPersonal InjuryTaxes� Legal commentary from FindLaw's Writ�LAW DICTIONARY� (FindLaw) -- By now, nearly everyone has heard of Armin Meiwes. Meiwes, a German citizen, has freely admitted to dismembering another German man and eating his flesh. (German charged with cannibalism)
Indeed, Meiwes carefully preserved the killing on videotape and still had pieces of the body in his freezer when he was arrested. During much of the process of dismemberment, the victim reportedly remained conscious.
At first glance, it would seem it should be easy for German authorities to prosecute Meiwes. In fact, however, as the New York Times reported on December 27, though the authorities want to prosecute Meiwes to the fullest extent of the law, they are having trouble finding any serious crimes with which to charge him.
The obstacle to a murder charge is the fact that the evidence incontrovertibly shows that Meiwes's victim wanted to be eaten. Indeed, he had agreed to the arrangement over the Internet, answering an ad placed by Meiwes that specifically sought a person who wanted to be slaughtered and cannibalized.
In the United States, the victim's consent is no defense to murder, and it would be easy to prosecute an American counterpart to Meiwes. But in Germany, the victim's consent renders the crime a "killing on request" -- that is, an instance of illegal euthanasia. Unfortunately, this offense is punishable by a very modest sentence of from six months to five years of incarceration.
Meanwhile, cannibalism itself is not illegal under German law. Accordingly, the lesser offense of "disturbing the peace of the dead" is all that prosecutors reportedly have come up with to address the fact that Meiwes not only killed his victim, but butchered his corpse.
Despite legal impediments, German prosecutors are still trying to go after Meiwes for murder. They are seeking life imprisonment on the murder charge -- the maximum sentence in Germany, which does not believe in sentencing criminals to death. But to prevail, they will likely to have to show the victim was of unsound mind -- and that Meiwes was aware of that fact. Because of some of the novel issues involved, the case is expected to reach Germany's highest court within the next few years.
But even if the murder charge fails under German law, there may be an option that would cause Meiwes to serve a sentence more commensurate with his crimes. As I will explain below, German prosecutors may want to draw upon European and international human rights agreements against torture when charging Meiwes -- including treaties such as the Convention Against Torture, as well as customary international law against inhuman or degrading treatment.
After all, if human rights law cannot be applied to instances of willful flaying, dismemberment, quasi-human sacrifice and cannibalism, when can it be applied?
Or, put another way, should Meiwes get off so easily simply because Germany does not have a crime specific to the atrocity committed here?
The option of using European and international law to charge Meiwes
Fortunately for German authorities, within the international legal framework, there are many laws against the kind of treatment that Meiwes meted out to his victim. And these laws take no notice of arguments that the victim somehow consented to what was done to him or her. Instead, they simply make certain kinds of behavior off limits, regardless of the state of mind of the victim.
Invoking international human rights law, German prosecutors should aggressively pursue the Meiwes case as a crime of torture. There is no impediment to their doing so, for in German courts, European Union law and international treaties enjoy a legal status wholly equivalent to that of domestic German statutes.
Granted, under German law, German constitutional norms will prevail over contrary terms of treaties ratified by Germany. But in this case, the problem with prosecuting Meiwes reportedly is not that the German Constitution forbids it. Instead, the problem is merely that domestic criminal laws are difficult to apply to the unique -- to say the least -- facts of Meiwes's case.
Importantly, there is no due process issue here: Because treaties against torture were part of German law, Meiwes was fully on notice they could apply to his acts -- including his acts against a fellow German citizen.
Indeed, the criminality of Meiwes's acts was hardly subtle. Meiwes's acts, to apply the U.S. distinction, were malum in se -- evil in themselves -- and not malum prohibitum -- evil simply because society says so. It is not as if Meiwes were being indicted for obscure tax offenses; rather, he killed, dismembered, and consumed another human being.
European law charges the German prosecutors could bring
What specific charges might German prosecutors bring? To begin, there are a number of European law claims they could raise.
First, they could bring a claim under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which Germany has ratified. The Convention states in Article 3 that, "no one should be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." Certainly what Meiwes did to his victim fits this description.
Second, they could try to bring charges pursuant to the European Convention on the Prevention of Torture -- which entered into force in 1989 and which has been ratified by Germany. This agreement created a committee that investigates allegations of torture, primarily by conducting visits to the torture victim's place of confinement. Here, the investigation ought to be brief, as Meiwes has confessed and the nature of his crimes is clear. While the Convention itself does not contain any remedies, it does allow torture victims to bring claims before the highly respected European Court of Human Rights, which has the authority to afford "just satisfaction" to the harmed party (or his heirs).
Customary international law charges the German prosecutors could bring
In addition to this European law against torture, there is also international law against torture -- upon which the German prosecutors might also draw.
International law recognizes a select handful of norms, called jus cogens, that are held to form the bedrock legal principles for acceptable civilized existence. Torture is among the actions typically considered to violate these norms, and thus to go against the basic standards of acceptable human behavior.
Customary international law evolves in a variety of ways, including through the decisions of regional and international tribunals, and the writings of certain highly skilled legal experts. It also develops through the work of certain deliberative bodies such as the International Law Commission (ILC), a group of legal experts that codifies international law for the United Nations.
Several years ago, when the ILC drafted the statute for the International Criminal Court, it included torture as one of the crimes over which the Court would have jurisdiction. Unfortunately, however, torture was later removed from the list at the strident insistence of the United States. However, it remains the ILC's own view that torture remains a jus cogens violation.
International treaty law charges the prosecutors could bring
Finally, German prosecutors could look to those international treaties that Germany has ratified -- and thus have been incorporated into German law -- when charging Meiwes.
The International Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the "Torture Convention") applies only to actions authorized or tacitly permitted by government actors. This does not seem to have been the case with respect to Meiwes's actions.
Thus, prosecutors ought to instead try to invoke the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). ICCPR Article 7 states flatly that "no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
Moreover, the ICCPR makes states responsible for granting all of the rights provided therein. And it does not require participation, knowledge, or authorization by a governmental actor.
Consent is no defense when torture is the offense
These international and European law sources appropriately recognize that, when the crime is torture, the victim's consent is almost completely irrelevant. As has been exhaustibly documented in studies from around the world, torture victims will "consent" to almost anything if faced with enough pain. As a result, a victim's consent to torture can never be trusted.
Thus, the treaties and international customary law are correct not to take consent into account. A victim's consent to be tortured should not -- and does not -- eliminate the torturer's responsibility for his acts. This removes the German authorities' primary obstacle and opens the door for a more appropriate conviction and sentencing for this serious act.

Analysis: Romney attack ads misrepresent factsStory Highlights Romney ad attacking McCain's immigration record inaccurate on McCain's position Ad attacking Huckabee misrepresents quote from Condoleezza Rice Huckabee decides not to air television ad responding to Romney Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO From Howard Kurtz CNN Washington Bureau	Editors Note: Howard Kurtz is the media reporter for The Washington Post and host of CNN's Reliable Sources. In a television ad, Mitt Romney misrepresents John McCain's position on immigration, a CNN analysis finds. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two negative ads recently launched by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who has spent more on advertising than any other candidate, either misrepresent his rival's records or include distortions, according to a CNN analysis of the commercials. The ads come as the Republican air war has erupted into a series of attacks ads, just days before the Iowa caucuses on January 3, Wyoming caucuses on January 5, and the New Hampshire primary on January 8. In one Romney television ad running in New Hampshire, the announcer calls rival Sen. John McCain "an honorable man" then goes on to ask "but is he the right Republican for the future?" "McCain pushed to let every illegal immigrant stay here permanently..." the announcer charges. "Even voted to allow illegals to collect Social Security." Watch Romney's ad attacking McCain » But the ad distorts the position of the Arizona Republican, who has narrowed Romney's lead in New Hampshire. McCain's compromise legislation introduced last summer, which was backed by President Bush, would have required illegal immigrants to return to their home countries and pay a fine for breaking the law before applying for legal status. McCain also voted to allow illegals to receive past Social Security benefits only after obtaining legal status. Romney, for his part, ordered a police crackdown on illegal immigrants two weeks before he left the job of governor of Massachusetts. While Romney is strafing McCain in New Hampshire, his target in Iowa is former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. In the anti-Huckabee commercial, the announcer calls Romney and Huckabee "two good men," then asks "but who is ready to make tough decisions?" "Mike Huckabee? Soft on government spending.... His foreign policy? 'Ludicrous,' says Condoleezza Rice," the announcer continues. Secretary of State Rice, however, did not call Huckabee's foreign policy "ludicrous." Rice was responding to Huckabee's criticism of the Bush administration for what he called an "arrogant bunker mentality" on world affairs in the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. McCain is fighting back by using criticism of Romney from editorial writers, which has the effect of making him seem less negative.

In the McCain ad, the announcer says, "As you hear Mitt Romney attack John McCain, consider these words from New Hampshire newspapers. The Union Leader says John McCain has 'conviction' and 'Granite Staters want a candidate who will look them in the eye and tell them the truth.' " "John McCain has done that," the announcer continues, quoting the newspaper's editorial. "Mitt Romney has not." While Romney's ads say a few nice words about Huckabee and McCain before ripping their records, the commercials could backfire on Romney. In races with crowded fields, negative ads have sparked voter backlash against squabbling politicians. The attacks wind up helping candidates who stick with a positive message. That may be why Huckabee on Monday announced he had pulled a television ad his campaign had prepared to respond to Romney's criticism. Watch Huckabee explain why he pulled the ad » He said he called his staff Monday morning and told them he wanted it pulled. "I just decided that's not the way we want to run it," the former pastor said. "It's never too late to do the right thing." Huckabee acknowledged that he expected "cynicism" from those who believe that by showing the ad at the news conference he is still launching the attack while coming across as a candidate who wants to stay positive. But, Huckabee said, he expects that if he had not shown the ad, reporters would have asked to see it. "Conventional political wisdom is that when you're hit, and it's beginning to do damage, the smart play is to hit back," Huckabee said during an event in Des Moines, Iowa. But he said, "that's not the way we want to run it." "We have to decide we can change the kind of politics and the level of discourse," Huckabee said. "We've got to start somewhere, so we might as well start here and might as well start with me." Huckabee said the commercial was sent to Iowa television stations and may air for a day before being pulled out of rotation. Huckabee also said he would not be surprised if the commercial was posted on YouTube. Romney launched a television ad in Iowa Monday, titled "Everywhere," that emphasizes a positive message. In that commercial, Romney says, "Everywhere my family and I go we hear that America's challenges are simply too big for Washington politicians. I've spent my life tackling big problems -- helping turn around business, the Olympics, and state government." "Together we can grow our economy, stop illegal immigration, defend life and preserve the values that make America the hope of the Earth," Romney says. "It's time to turn around Washington."

Obama more popular than his policies, poll showsStory Highlights Percentage of people who agree with Obama on the issues has gone down Percentage of people who say he has right personal qualities has gone up 63 percent approve of how Obama is handling his job as president, poll shows 28 percent of Republicans say Obama is doing a good job in office, poll shows Next Article in Politics » By Paul Steinhauser CNN Deputy Political Director	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A new national poll suggests that President Obama is personally more popular than his policies. Three in four Americans say President Obama has the personal qualities a president should have, the poll shows. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, released Monday, also indicates that 63 percent of Americans approve of how Obama is handling his duties as president. One in three questioned in the poll disapprove. Democrats overwhelmingly approve of how Obama is handling his job as president; 61 percent of independents agree. Only 28 percent of Republicans say the president is doing a good job in office. The survey, released two days before Obama marks 100 days in the White House, indicates that three in four Americans feel Obama has the personal qualities a president should have. But when asked whether Obama agrees with the respondent on the issues, that number drops to 57 percent. "Americans have two different assessments of President Obama. One, personal. The other, policy," CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. Don't Miss Bipartisanship didn't last long in first 100 days
Commentary: Give Obama an 'incomplete'
"What does the public find most controversial about President Obama? His policies, much more than his personal qualities." "Now that Obama is president, the number who agree with his views on the issues has gone down, while the number who say he has the right personal qualities has gone up," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland added. "That didn't happen the last time we had a new administration. In George W. Bush's first months in office, the number who thought he had the right personal skills to be president was lower than the number who felt that way during the 2000 presidential campaign." The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday, with 2,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

Man United thump Wigan as Arsenal top tableStory Highlights Michael Owen scores first goal for Manchester United in 5-0 victory at Wigan Arsenal make it 10 goals in two games, beating Portsmouth 4-1 to lead table Emmanuel Adebayor scores again for Manchester City in 1-0 win over WolvesNext Article in World Sport » (CNN) -- Michael Owen scored his first goal for Manchester United, and fellow-striker Wayne Rooney his 100th, as the English Premier League champions returned to winning form with a thumping 5-0 victory at Wigan on Saturday. Michael Owen celebrates his first Manchester United goal as the English champions thumped Wigan 5-0. Meanwhile, Arsenal top the table on goal difference after making it 10 goals from just two matches with a 4-1 home win over bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth. But all eyes were on United, after their stunning 1-0 midweek defeat at newly-promoted Burnley, and Alex Ferguson's side endured a frustrating first 45 minutes against determined opponents. However, Rooney finally made the breakthrough in the 56th minute with a fine header from former Wigan winger Antonio Valencia's cross From then on, United were always in control. They doubled their lead two minutes later when Dimitar Berbatov cheekily chipped the ball over goalkeeper Chris Kirkland before finding the net with his second touch. Rooney added his second, and United's third in the 65th minute with a shot that deflected off defender Mario Melchiot. The England striker then made way for compatriot Owen, who broke his United duck with five minutes remaining with a cool finish after being set-up by Nani. Portuguese Nani had the final word with a superb free-kick in stoppage time that sailed over a stranded Kirkland's head. Arsenal followed up last weekend's 6-1 win at Everton by thumping Portsmouth, who have now lost all three of their matches, at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners took an 18th-minute lead when Abou Diaby smashed home Eduardo's cut-back and the French midfielder added a second when he slotted home a Cesc Fabregas pass.

Portsmouth pulled a goal back before half-time when Younes Kaboul took advantage of hesitancy by goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to head home a Madir Belhadj cross. The home side restored their two-goal lead in the 51st minute when William Gallas, who scored a fortunate goal against Celtic in midweek, was again lucky to deflect a Thomas Vermaelen volley over the line. Substitute Aaron Ramsey beat the offside trap to make it 4-1 on 69 minutes when he latched onto Robin van Persie's slide-rule pass. Former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor scored for the second successive weekend to help big-spending Manchester City make it two wins out of two with a narrow 1-0 victory at home to newly-promoted Wolves. The Togo striker crashed home a Carlos Tevez pass to secure the points for Mark Hughes' side. Kenwyne Jones scored twice as Sunderland recovered from going a goal behind to beat Blackburn 2-1 at the Stadium of Light. French defender Gael Givet gave Blackburn the lead when he thumped home a left-footed shot through a crowded penalty area. But Jones levelled when he rounded goalkeeper Paul Robinson and slotted home into an empty net and the Trinidad striker nodded home the winner in the 54th-minute from Lee Cattermole's cross. Kamel Ghilas scored his first goal for the club to give Hull their opening win of the season, 1-0 at home to Bolton, while Birmingham and Stoke shared a 0-0 draw in the day's other match.

Racing past illness and bias toward love By Shane Stanford, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSShane Stanford is husband and father, author, and a pastorHe is racing against illness and fear: Stanford is an HIV-positive hemophiliacJourney has shown relationships, simplicity, giving are most important "No matter how I try to describe myself, I am more than the sum of what I can say"
RELATED TOPICS

Hattiesburg
Editor's note: America's 300 million-plus people are declaring their identity in the 2010 Census this year. This piece is part of a special series on CNN.com in which people describe how they see their own identity. Shane Stanford is pastor of Gulf Breeze United Methodist Church, a husband, father of three, HIV positive for more than 20 years and author of "A Positive Life." (CNN) -- I am Shane Stanford. To my family, I am a husband of 20 years and the boastful father of three. To my congregation of nearly 5,000, I am a pastor. To my readers, I am the author of nine Christian books. To my friends, I am one of the guys. And, to so many over the years who have known my story, I am a man in a race -- a race against illness, against fear, against discrimination. A race against my own body. A race against time. A hemophiliac since birth, I discovered my HIV status at 16. It was life-changing news, the result of a contaminated blood supply. And, so, the race began. It has included many twists and turns: from the joy of marrying my high school sweetheart to the sorrow of being rejected by the first church to which I was appointed as pastor. Certainly, the race has never been easy. It is often long and difficult. THE BASICSName: Shane StanfordAge: 39 Birthplace: Hattiesburg, MississippiHome: Gulf Breeze, Florida
Occupation: Pastor of Gulf Breeze United Methodist Church, writer
However, the race now impacts me in so many ways. And, oddly enough, I would not trade it with anyone. Instead, the journey affords me a glimpse into the best of what each of us can become. The race has made me a student, and no day goes by that it doesn't teach me a lesson. About time: A privilege afforded to us to make a difference in this world. About relationships: The most important things we do are not done alone. About simplicity: More, bigger, nicer, pale in comparison to gifts like sunsets and the laughter of children at play. About real meaning... and about myself: Life is more a mosaic than a measurable frame of joys and sorrows, laughter and tears. Real meaning is discovered through the composition of life's diversity. No color can adequately define a mosaic, any more than one hardship, failure or achievement can define a person's life. The diversity of these images brought together unveil who I really am. No matter how I try to describe myself, I am more than the sum of what I can say. So, I run ... for those I love and, even, for those I have never met. I run to make life matter, seeking more than the right way to go, but actually going there and watching the race mean something.

4 ways we're still fighting the Civil War By John Blake, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe United States marks the 150th anniversary of the Civil WarAmericans still argue over many issues that led to war, scholars sayScholar: "There are all of these weird parallels"Southern historian: Confederate leaders are American heroes CNN -- He stood 5-foot-8 and weighed 145 pounds. His face was gaunt and sunburned. Ticks, fleas and lice covered his body. Before battle, his lips would quiver and his body went numb. When the shooting started, some of his comrades burst into maniacal laughter. Others bit the throat and ears of their enemy. And some were shattered by shells so powerful that tufts of their hair stuck to rocks and trees. Take a tour of a Civil War battlefield today, and it's difficult to connect the terrifying experience of an average Civil War soldier -- described above from various historical accounts -- with the tranquil historic sites where we now snap pictures today. But you don't have to tour a battlefield to understand the Civil War. Look at today's headlines. As the nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of its deadliest war this week, some historians say we're still fighting over some of the same issues that fueled the Civil War. "There are all of these weird parallels," says Stephanie McCurry, author of "Confederate Reckoning," a new book that examines why Southerners seceded and its effect on Southern women and slaves. "When you hear charges today that the federal government is overreaching, and the idea that the Constitution recognized us as a league of sovereign states -- these were all part of the secessionist charges in 1860," she says. "Living history" on Civil War battlefields These "weird parallels" go beyond the familiar debates over what caused the war, slavery or states' rights. They extend to issues that seem to have nothing to do with the Civil War. The shutdown of the federal government, war in Libya, the furor over the new health care law and Guantanamo Bay -- all have tentacles that reach back to the Civil War, historians say. They point to four parallels: The disappearance of the political center If you think the culture wars are heated now, check out mid-19th century America. The Civil War took place during a period of pervasive piety when both North and South demonized one another with self-righteous, biblical language, one historian says. One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives. We still debate those politics.--William Blair, Civil War historian
The war erupted not long after the "Second Great Awakening" sparked a national religious revival. Reform movements spread across the country. Thousands of Americans repented of their sins at frontier campfire meetings and readied themselves for the Second Coming. They got war instead. Their moral certitude helped make it happen, says David Goldfield, author of "America Aflame," a new book that examines evangelical Christianity's impact on the war. Goldfield says evangelical Christianity "poisoned the political process" because the American system of government depends on compromise and moderation, and evangelical religion abhors both because "how do you compromise with sin." "By transforming political issues into moral causes, you raise the stakes of the conflict and you tend to demonize your opponents," Goldfield says. Contemporary political rhetoric is filled with similar rhetoric. Opponents aren't just wrong -- they're sinners, Goldfield says. "The erosion of the center in contemporary American politics is the most striking parallel between today and the time just before the Civil War," Goldfield says. In the lead-up to the war, political campaigns were filled with religious fervor. Political parties paraded their piety and labeled opponents infidels. "Today's government gridlock results, in part, from this religious mind set that many issues can be divided into good and evil and sin and salvation," he says. A Union artillery crew poses before battle. Each side underestimated the opposing army, historians say. How much power should the federal government have? Nullification, states' rights and secession. Those terms might sound like they're lifted from a Civil War history book, but they're actually making a comeback on the national stage today. Since the rise of the Tea Party and debate over the new health care law, more Republican lawmakers have brandished those terms. Republican lawmakers in at least 11 states invoked nullification to thwart the new health care law, according to a recent USA Today article. It was the kind of talk that led to the Civil War, historians say. "One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives. We still debate those politics," says William Blair, director of the George and Ann Richards Civil War Era Center at Pennsylvania State University. The Southern answer to that question ignited the war. When they seceded, their leaders said that they were protecting the inherent rights of sovereign states. They invoked the 13 Colonies' fight for independence. We wanted to be left alone. What actually caused the war was Lincoln's insistence that, no, we can't let these people go. --H.W. Crocker III, Southern historian

H.W. Crocker III, author of "The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War," says Southern secessionists were patriots reaffirming the Founding Fathers' belief that the Colonies were free and independent states. "If the Southern states pulled out of the union today after, say, the election of Barack Obama, or some other big political issue like abortion, how many of us would think the appropriate reaction from the federal government would be to blockade Southern ports and send armies into Virginia?" Crocker asks. He says men such as Jefferson Davis, the leader of the Confederacy, are American heroes. "Jefferson Davis was not trying to force anything on the people in the North," he says. "We wanted to be left alone. What actually caused the war is Lincoln's insistence that no, we can't let these people go." Slavery caused the war, says McCurry, author of "Confederate Reckoning," and most historians. Southern slaveholders invoked the Revolution while trying to build an antidemocratic slave state "dedicated to the proposition that all men are not created equal," McCurry says. They also didn't want to lose the tremendous wealth generated by slave labor, she says. "They felt confident because they were the biggest producers of cotton in the Western world at the height of the Industrial Revolution." Unleashing the dogs of war During the run-up to the Iraq War, former Vice President Dick Cheney famously declared that American troops would be welcomed as "liberators" in Iraq. Cheney made the mistake that political leaders have been making for ages -- he didn't know the enemy, says Emory Thomas, author of "The Dogs of War," which examines how ignorance on both sides led to the Civil War. "Cheney thought it was going to be France in 1944, but it ended up Georgia in 1864," Thomas says. Civil War leaders made the same mistake, Thomas says. Northern leaders like Lincoln didn't really think ordinary Southerners who had no slaves would fight in defense of slavery. Southerners didn't think Northerners were willing to go to war to preserve the Union, he says. And few on both sides expected the war to be so bloody and long. "America in 1861 didn't realize what the hell they were doing," he says. "They just weren't willing to think of unpleasant possibilities." We risk the same mistakes when we commit to "limited" military campaigns in places such as Iraq and, most recently, Libya, Thomas says. When President Obama announced a limited air bombing campaign in Libya, Thomas thought about the political leaders before the Civil War. Each incrementally committed to various military provocations, thinking events wouldn't spiral out of control. They were wrong. "Once you commit to war, you don't have any control over how it ends," Thomas says. "It's amazing how that sounds like Libya now. We may blunder into success, but we don't know who these guys (Libyan rebels) are." The battlefields are quiet and even tranquil today, but the average Civil War soldier faced horror and exhaustion. The president as dictator Barack Obama isn't the first black president, according to some Southern secessionists. That would be Abraham Lincoln. He was called a "black Republican" and the "Great Dictator." There was a reason a large number of Americans despised Lincoln during the war. Think of the nation's recent "War on Terror." Some Americans thought Lincoln used the war to ignore the Constitution and expand the powers of the presidency. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus (it gives a person who is jailed the right to challenge their detention in court) during the war and used military courts to arrests thousands of civilians. Those legal decisions loom over post-9/11 America, historians say. How do we treat American citizens caught attempting to bomb U.S. cities? How do we clamp down on American citizens who preach overthrowing the government? What rights do Guantanamo Bay prisoners possess? "It's not just what does a president do against an enemy," says Blair, the Civil War historian. "It's what do you do against your own citizens to determine loyalty. That's a big debate today." Lincoln skillfully addressed that debate, says Brian McGinty, author of "Lincoln & the Court." He says Lincoln confronted unprecedented problems: The South was in rebellion, the nation's capital was in real danger from rebels in Virginia and their sympathizers in Maryland. At one point, a mob blocked passage of Northern troops through Maryland to defend Washington. "His oath of office required him to 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution' and he believed that the best way to do that was to preserve the Union," McGinty says. "What good would the Constitution be if the country itself was lost?" McGinty doesn't think Lincoln became a dictator. He says he allowed the presidential election to take place in 1864. He worked with Congress. He asked military officers to arrest disloyal persons sparingly, and he never tolerated abuse of prisoners. Lincoln said his actions would ultimately be subject to the review of the American people, not the courts, McGinty says. "He called the people 'The Great Tribunal' and said that they would have the final word on constitutional issues. In the end, The Great Tribunal approved of what he had done. So, for the most part, has history." The Great Tribunal, however, has yet to render a unanimous verdict on the Civil War. A century-and-a-half after the war ended, people still clash over the causes and meaning. Blair says they still clash because the war doesn't fit many Americans' image of themselves or their past. "The American story of our past has been a hopeful, helpful narrative," he says. "But it's hard for us to understand that there was a time in this country when the Constitution protected slavery, and it was actually legal. "How do you insert the story of slavery into that?"

Republican obsession with Benghazi makes no sense
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst
updated 10:31 AM EST, Thu November 29, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen: Susan Rice's trip to Capitol Hill wasn't a success, senators said
He says the GOP continues to bash Rice for her mistaken explanation for Benghazi attack
Bergen says the argument that Obama administration deliberately lied doesn't hold up
The intelligence community decided not to initially reveal truth about attack, he says
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst and the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." (CNN) -- Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, a possible nominee to be the next secretary of state, came to Capitol Hill Tuesday to perform a private mea culpa to key Republican senators for her erroneous initial public statements about the perpetrators of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September in which four Americans were killed.
It didn't work.
After Tuesday's meeting with Rice, Sen. John McCain said, "It is clear that the information that she gave the American people was incorrect when she said that it was a spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video."
Peter Bergen Sen. Lindsey Graham who also met with Rice observed, "Bottom line: I'm more disturbed now than I was before."
What is the Republican theory of the case against Rice? It appears to boil down to the idea that leading Democrats covered up the involvement of terrorists in some way connected to al Qaeda in the Benghazi attack during the run-up to the close presidential election because President Obama and others in his administration had for some time said that al Qaeda was close to strategic defeat.

Does this case make sense? First, you would have to accept that Obama, Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all knowingly deceived the American public about what had happened at the Benghazi consulate.
When this notion was raised in October during the second presidential debate, Obama scolded Republican challenger Mitt Romney saying, "the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador -- anybody on my team -- would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive."
According to a CNN poll released Tuesday most Americans agree with the president and do not believe that anyone in his administration intentionally tried to mislead them about what happened in Benghazi.

McCain: Iraq and Libya entirely different
Ayotte: Rice 'certainly' misled on Libya
Second, it was the intelligence community, not officials at the White House or State Department, that eliminated from the talking points used by Rice after the Benghazi attack the suspected involvement of the Libyan jihadist group, Ansar al-Sharia.
According to accounts of former CIA director David Petraeus' closed door testimony about Benghazi to congressional intelligence committees earlier this month, the intelligence community eliminated references to Ansar al-Sharia in the talking points so as not to tip off members of the terrorist group that the CIA believed that they were responsible for the attack.
Ayotte: Rice 'certainly' misled on Benghazi, but unsure of motive
The conspiracy therefore was not to mislead the American public but to mislead America's enemies.
If Rice had gone beyond her unclassified talking points and said that Ansar al-Sharia was suspected to be behind the Benghazi attacks, no doubt she would now be being hounded for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
Third, it is worth recalling that whenever there is a news event in a chaotic country on the other side of the world, first accounts about the event are often wrong.
Remember the erroneous reports about another big news event last year; the death of Osama bin Laden. Initially, it was portrayed by the Obama administration that bin Laden had died during a firefight with U.S. forces in Pakistan and had used his wife as a human shield.
As more accurate information subsequently came in from the field, administration officials clarified that bin Laden put up no resistance and had not used his wife as a shield.
This is not conspiracy; this is the fog of war.
It is also worth recalling that the situation in Benghazi was so chaotic and dangerous that it took three weeks for the FBI to get in to the city to investigate what had happened at the consulate.
And it took even more time for the facts to emerge that the Benghazi mission wasn't really a consulate in any conventional sense, but was more of a CIA listening station and that two of the four Americans who had died in the attack weren't diplomats as initially portrayed but were, in fact, CIA contractors.
Opinion: Why attacks on Rice are misguided
The fact that Republicans have pressed to learn more about the security arrangements at the consulate and security in Benghazi overall as well as the details of what happened the night of the attack has ended up bringing to light much useful information.
But none of that information has changed the basic fact that a tragedy occurred at Benghazi, not a cover up.
Rubio: Why we need answers on Benghazi
Stepping back from the whole debate about how Rice came to make inaccurate public statements about Benghazi, there is another premise of the Republican attacks upon her that deserves considerable skepticism.
We are supposed to believe that because Ansar al-Sharia -- a group inspired by al Qaeda's ideas, but having no links to the terrorist group that attacked the United States on 9/11 -- was able to pull off a deadly attack in a Middle Eastern country ravaged by a recent war against a lightly defended U.S. mission, killing four, that al Qaeda is suddenly an important threat again to the United States.
If you buy that, I have a bridge in Benghazi I'd like to sell you.

Afghanistan says U.S. special forces may be behind torture, murder
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 5:25 AM EST, Mon February 25, 2013
U.S. toops patrol in Wardak province of Afghanistan in 2010.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "Such actions have caused local public resentment and hatred," Karzai's office says An armed group is torturing and killing innocent people, Afghanistan's government says
The group is "named as" U.S. special forces, according to the Afghan president's office
The U.S. military says it is investigating
(CNN) -- The Afghan government says armed individuals who may be U.S. special forces carried out acts of torture and murder, allegations that spurred it to demand that members of the elite American military units leave a key province west of Kabul.
The U.S. military says it is investigating.
NATO's International Security Assistance Force must stop all special force operations out of Wardak province, an area west of the Afghan capital where the alleged horrors took place, Afghanistan's National Security Council demanded. And all U.S. special forces must be gone from the province within two weeks.
At a meeting of the council, led by President Hamid Karzai, "it became clear that armed individuals named as U.S. special force stationed in Wardak province engage in harassing, annoying, torturing and even murdering innocent people," Karzai's office said in a statement. It did not indicate who "named" the group a U.S. special force.
Nine people "disappeared in an operation by this suspicious force," according to the president's office. And in another incident, a student was taken from his home at night, and his "tortured body with throat cut was found two days later under a bridge."

"Such actions have caused local public resentment and hatred," Karzai's office said.
It added that the United States rejects any suggestion that its special forces carried out any such operation.
Afghan forces must protect people in the province "by effectively stopping and bringing to justice any groups that enter peoples' homes in the name of special force and who engage in annoying, harassing and murdering innocent people," the statement said.
"We take all allegations of misconduct seriously and go to great lengths to determine the facts surrounding them," U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. Until military officials speak with Afghan officials about the issue, "we are not in a position to comment further," the statement added.
"This is an important issue that we intend to fully discuss with our Afghan counterparts."
Last April, the United States and Afghanistan signed a deal giving Afghan authorities an effective veto over controversial special forces missions.
The agreement prevents ISAF from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of Afghan officials, said a senior NATO official. And special operations forces will operate under Afghan law, said a statement from Karzai's office.
The complex system fully"Afghanized" such operations, putting Afghan commandos in the lead and giving American special forces a "training and support role," a senior Afghan official said.
Under the deal, U.S. special forces would be on the ground but would not enter the home of an Afghan unless specifically asked to do so by the Afghan commandos leading the operation, or by other Afghan officials, according to a senior NATO official.
This pact followed months of recriminations against special operations raids, particularly at night, that have deeply offended some Afghans angry about foreigners entering their homes.
U.S. officials have said such raids are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents.
CNN's Greg Botelho, Barbara Starr and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.

25 of mankind's greatest engineering achievements
By Tamara Hinson, for CNN
updated 12:00 PM EST, Sun December 22, 2013
The Palm islands comprise approximately 100 million cubic meters of rock and sand. In total, 210 million cubic meters of rock, sand and limestone were reclaimed (through dredging) to create the islands, with 10 million cubic meters of rock used in the outer ring alone. The rocks used for both islands were transported from 16 quarries throughout the UAE and the materials used are enough to build a wall that could circle the world three times. Completion date: September 24, 2008.
The Aqueduct, one of the Iberian Peninsula's best preserved ancient monuments, features 44 double arches (or 88 when counted individually) and 79 single arches -- a total of 167. It was built during the reign of Roman Emperor Trajan and is still in use today, carrying water from the Frío river to the town of Segovia. The bridge, which consists of 24,000 granite blocks, was constructed without the use of mortar and each of its 167 arches is more than nine meters high. Completion date: AD 50.
The Great Wall of China is 8,850 kilometers long (5,500 miles) and was constructed over a period of 2,000 years. Construction began in 475 BC, to protect China from the invading Huns. During the Ming dynasty, between 1368 and 1644 A.D, it was given a makeover, with the addition of watchtowers, battlements and cannons -- some of which stand 980 meters above sea level. The mortar used to bind the stones of the wall is made from rice flour. Completion date: 204 BC.
As many as 28 different varieties of semi-precious and precious stones were used to adorn the exterior of the Taj Mahal.
Construction of the Taj Mahal took around 20 years, beginning in around 1632 and finishing around 1653. Exact dates are unknown. The building, which was made from white marble from the quarries of Rajasthan, appears pink in the morning, white in the day and golden in the moonlight. The building is symmetrical in every way, and was built as a memorial to the wife of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Completion date: 1653.
The Trans-Siberian Railroad connects Moscow and Eastern Russia with Japan, China and Mongolia.
Northern Siberia isn't the easiest landscape to cross, which is what makes the 8,851-kilometer (5,500 mile) Trans-Siberian railway so impressive. Engineers had to design a railway that was capable of operating in temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius. The railway travels through eight time zones, 87 towns and cities and crosses 16 major rivers, including the Volga, Ob, Yenisey, Oka and Amur. Some 90,000 people helped construct the railway, which took 10 years to build -- pretty impressive considering the tools at workers' disposal were shovels, picks and wheelbarrows. Completion date: 1904.
The Burj Khalifa has a height of 828 meters and is both the tallest building in the world and the tallest free-standing structure in the world. Engineers faced multiple challenges, including the strong winds that batter the tower. Because of this, over 40 wind tunnel tests were conducted, not just to determine how the wind would affect the building but also to test the cranes used to construct it. Completion date: January 4, 2010.
It took 2 million workers 10 years to construct the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. It connects the city of Kobe, on Japan's mainland, with Iwaya on Awaji Island. Before it opened, the only way to get between the two cities was by ferry. However, the waterway was prone to severe storms and when two ferries capsized in 1955, killing 168 people, public outrage convinced the government of the need for a bridge. It's the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a length of 1,991 meters. Completion date: April 5, 1998.
Built during the Klondike Gold Rush and financed largely by British investors, the "railroad built on gold" was constructed in just 26 months, using 450 tons of explosives to blast through Canada's coastal mountains. Passengers should hold on tight -- the railroad climbs almost 278 meters in just 32 kilometers and has numerous other steep gradients of up to 4%.
The railway still uses vintage cars, the oldest dating back to 1881. Completion date: July 29, 1900.
The Sky Tree's reinforced concrete center column is separate from the surrounding steel framing and incorporates an earthquake-resistant design similar to that used in pagoda temples.
Engineers really did reach for the sky when they built the 634-meter Tokyo Sky Tree in earthquake-prone Japan, although given that the company responsible for the design is the same company behind plans for a space elevator, we think the structure will be around for a good few years. It was built on notoriously unstable reclaimed ground, but engineers used a traditional Japanese building technique known as shinbashira, which relies on one central column to counterbalance seismic waves, greatly reducing the sway. Completion date: May 22, 2012.
The International Space Station cost $100 billion to build and involved 100,000 people in 15 nations. It also ranks as one of the more unusual construction sites, located 354 kilometers (220 miles) above Earth. The hazards faced by those carrying out maintenance go far beyond a falling hammer or nail gun injury -- one tiny rip in a protective spacesuit means instant death. Completion date: Ongoing.
Teotihuacan is an Aztec name meaning "the place where men become Gods."
It was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas. The most famous structure is the Pyramid of the Sun, which was built in two phases. The second phase took its height to 224 meters, making it the third-tallest pyramid in the world. The entire city originally covered around 20 square kilometers (eight square miles) and was home to 2,200 structures, built with stone and lime plaster. Completion date: 100 BC.
More than 4.5 million cubic yards of concrete were used in the construction of this canal's locks and dams.
The Panama Canal is a 77-kilometer (47-mile) long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earth and rubble excavated to make way for it was enough to bury Manhattan to a depth of four meters. A series of locks allows ships to pass through the water; each of the moveable lock doors weighs 750 tons and each of the locks fills with 52 million gallons of water to accommodate the 15,000 ships that use the canal every year. Completion date: January 7, 1914.
Fast fact: Taipei 101 was the first building in the world to break through 500 meters.
Upon its completion, the tower claimed several records: it had the world's fastest elevator, was the world's tallest building and was the world's tallest structure, thanks to its spire. Eight "mega-columns" make the building especially earthquake resistant. Completion date: December 31, 2004. The Skywalk's foundation is strong enough to support 71 million pounds -- the equivalent of 71 fully loaded 747 airplanes.
Located 1,219 meters above the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon's Sky Walk consists of one million pounds of steel and 83,000 pounds of glass. It was the creation of Las Vegas businessman David Jin, who approached the Hualapai Tribe with the idea of a glass walkway over the Grand Canyon in 1996. The Skywalk was assembled on site, with the drilling alone taking over a year to complete. Completion date: March 28, 2007.
The trapezoid-shaped opening near the top of the Shanghai World Financial Center reduces wind pressure on this 101-story-building.
When it was completed in 2008, the Shanghai World Financial Center became the second-tallest building in the world and the tallest building in mainland China, with a total height of 492 meters. Its most distinctive feature is its trapezoid, which is designed to reduce wind pressure and has earned the building the nickname "bottle opener." Visitors to the observation deck can purchase bottle openers in the shape of the building. Completion date: July 17, 2008.
The Millau Viaduct has the highest road bridge deck in Europe -- it sits 270 meters (890 feet) above the Tarn river at its highest point.
The Millau Viaduct is the world's tallest bridge, with a total height of 343 meters (886 ft), making it taller than the Eiffel Tower. The viaduct, which crosses the valley of the river Tarn, was created to ease traffic on the route between Paris and Spain. It cost €320 million ($412 million dollars) but offers good value for money, with a lifespan of 120 years. Completion date: December 16, 2004.
Aldgate Station, on the Circle, Hammersmith and City and Metropolitan Lines, is built on a huge plague pit, where more than 1,000 bodies were buried.
The London Underground celebrated its 150th birthday this year. The entire network has a length of 402 kilometers (249 miles) and more than 1 billion journeys are made every year. When it opened in 1863, it was the world's first underground railway and the trains, which traveled between Paddington and Farringdon, were gas-lit wooden carriages pulled by steam locomotives. Completion date: January 10, 1863. Kansai International Airport was the first airport to be built on an artificial island.
Osaka is one of Japan's most crowded cities, so when a new airport was called for, engineers came up with a novel solution -- a man-made island. Construction of the island, which measures four kilometers (2.5 miles) by 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) took three years. Some 10,000 workers and 80 ships were used to excavate 21 million cubic meters of landfill and the island's construction became the world's most expensive civil engineering project, with a total cost of $20 billion. Completion date: 1994.
Dam workers wore "hard hats" made by coating cloth hats with coal tar. These proved to be such an effective way to protect the workers' heads that the contractor, Six Companies, ordered commercially made hard hats of the same design.
The Hoover dam rises 221 meters above the Colorado River and resulted in the creation of Lake Mead, which is the largest man-made lake in the Western Hemisphere and feeds Las Vegas and neighboring towns. The dam is 210 meters thick at its base and 13 meters thick at its highest point. It's a gravity dam, which means that its foundations rely on gravity to keep the structure from collapsing. Completion date: March 1, 1936.
The Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years.
The builders responsible for the Great Pyramid of Giza would have needed more than a few tea breaks to keep them motivated. The pyramid consists of 2.3 million stone blocks. The largest ones, found in the King's chamber, weigh between 25 and 80 tons and were transported to the site from Aswan, 800 kilometers away. In total, 5.5 million tons of limestone, 8,000 tons of granite and 500,000 tons of mortar were used. Experts have never worked out how the individual blocks were moved into place. Completion date: 2504 BC.
Each of the bridge's two main cables is made of 27,572 strands of wire. Often referred to as "the bridge that couldn't be built," the Golden Gate Bridge crosses the stretch of water nicknamed "the Golden Gate" by gold prospectors heading to the Californian hills. Prior to 1937, San Francisco was America's largest city but its growth rate was slow compared to others, due to the lack of a link with other communities around the bay. The size of the strait (2,042 meters wide) combined with strong winds and regular earthquakes led many construction experts to say a bridge couldn't be built. The solution? Huge amounts of concrete, 128,747 kilometers (80,000 miles) of wire housed inside two cables, 600,000 rivets and a whole lot of hard work. Completion date: May 27, 1937.
Temperature alters the height of the Eiffel Tower by up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) over the year.
The Eiffel Tower weighs 13,200 tons and was the first building to surpass the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It remained the world's tallest building until 1929, when New York's Chrysler Building took the top spot. Gustave Eiffel's initial building plans and calculations were so precise that no revisions had to be made during the construction process. Completion date: March 31, 1889.
The bridge's curve is designed to help drivers stay alert. Before construction of Confederation Bridge, the only way to reach Prince Edward Island from Canada's mainland was by ferry or airplane.
The wind, waves and snow that batter the bridge, which links Canada's smallest province with New Brunswick, forced engineers to come up with a concrete mix that was 60% stronger than most. A purpose-built floating crane, the Svanen, was used to maneuver the individual sections (which included 65 reinforced concrete piers) into place. Completion date: May 31, 1997.
The Colosseum could accommodate 50,000 spectators.
It's the largest amphitheater built by the Roman empire. It's estimated that the outer wall, which is 189 meters long and 156 meters wide, was originally built using 100,000 cubic meters of travertine stone. Some of this stone was later used in the construction of St Peter's Basilica and other nearby monuments. Completion date: 80 AD.
The CN Tower was built to withstand an earthquake of 8.5 on the Richter scale.
It was the world's tallest building when it was completed in 1976 and designed to withstand winds of up to 418 kph (260 mph). But strong winds and earthquakes are not the only factors the building has to contend with -- on average, lightning strikes the tower 75 times every year. Long copper strips, which run down the side of the building and are attached to grounding rods buried below ground, protect the structure from damage. Completion date: October 1, 1976.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dubai's Palm Islands comprise 100 million cubic meters of rock and sand
Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan, Mexico, is third tallest pyramid in the world
London Underground is used for more than 1 billion journeys every year
(CNN) -- A fair number of impressive construction plans have been announced this year, from Norway's intention to create the world's first shipping tunnel to Maldives' plans for a space age underwater hotel to Dubai's plans for the world's biggest shopping mall.
How do these announcements stack up against what's already out there?
We've compiled 25 of what we think are some of the most impressive engineering/construction achievements to date, taking into consideration the era in which they were built and the knowledge and materials that were available to designers.
Many were inspired by the human impulse to travel, and those that weren't can be enjoyed by travelers today.
Engineering can, of course, also include electronics and other micro-feats -- arguably computers and smartphones are among the most successful, popular and influential pieces of engineering ever created -- but we're interested here in big, bold and brave.
Click through the gallery to see our selection, then let us know if you have additions in the comments section.

At least 11 killed, 40 injured in double car bomb attack in Somalia
By Omar Nor and Ray Sanchez, CNN updated 9:18 AM EST, Thu January 2, 2014
Wreckage of cars is seen outside the Jazeera Hotel, in Mogadishu, Somalia, Thursday, January 2, 2014.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Double car bombs explode near a Somali hotel
At least 11 people are killed and up to 40 wounded
A statement on a website linked to Al-Shabaab says the terror network is behind the bombing
Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- The death toll of a twin car bombing at a hotel in Mogadishu rose to 11 Thursday, with many of the victims security force members, a police spokesman said. At least 40 other people were injured.
"The death toll has hit 11 people, including three attackers and five security personnel, while the rest were civilians," said Gen. Mohamed Yusuf Omar Madale, a Somali police spokesman.
At least four people were killed in the first attack Wednesday, Madale said. A half-hour later, another car bomb exploded just few meters from the scene of the first blast, killing at least seven people, mostly security officers.
Police official Yusuf Ali said Wednesday that the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, and the second blast came as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured.
At the time of the Mogadishu blasts, there were several senior members of the Somali government inside the hotel. It is believed the injured guards were part of the government officials' security detail.
Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed condemned the attack Wednesday night.
"The terrorists started 2014 as they finished 2013 with indiscriminate violence & killings. Will only serve to unite Somalia against them," his official Twitter account said.
A statement posted to a website associated with the Al-Shabaab terrorist network Thursday morning reads: "The mujahideen forces carried out the attacks and they will intensify their attacks against the government of Somalia and the African Union troops in the country."
Last month, another bombing at a hotel in the capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded, a government spokesman said.
A car bomb went off on November 8 outside Hotel Makkah Al-Mukarama in central Mogadishu, Abdikarim Hussein Guled, the African country's interior and national security minister, told local media.
Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali, the Somali government's former acting envoy to Britain better known as "Dhub," said Abdirahman Omar Osman, a presidential representative.
Other Somali violence has been traced to Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group and that was behind the deadly siege this fall of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall.
A U.S. military drone strike in southern Somalia in late October killed two suspected Al-Shabaab members, U.S. officials said. And a recent joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces killed at least 30 people believed to be part of that group.
In September 2012, Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, escaped an apparent assassination attempt at the Jazeera Palace Hotel, just two days after being selected as the troubled country's new leader.
According to a presidential media officer and several journalists at the scene, early indications are that the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers who set off explosives at the gates of the hotel, where the president was having high-level meetings.
At least four Somali government soldiers and one African Union soldier were killed in that attack, according to journalists at the scene.
The Jazeera Palace Hotel is near Mogadishu airport and it is frequented by government officials and diplomats.
Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu, and CNN's Ray Sanchez wrote this story from New York. Journalist Mohamed Nor contributed to this report.

In this story:The great outdoorsStaying indoorsWater, water, waterRELATEDS
By Kathy Stevens
THE FOLLOWING MEASURES CAN HELP YOU PREVENT EXERCISE-INDUCED DEHYDRATION:
Drink before, during and after exercise. Don't rely on your thirst to tell you how much fluid you need.
Avoid items that contain caffeine (e.g., coffee, soft drinks and tea) or alcohol because these can increase fluid loss.
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing that allows evaporation and ventilation.
If you become overheated, moisten your skin by sponging or spraying it with water to assist in cooling down.
Avoid the use of saunas, steam rooms and hot tubs immediately following exercise.
On very hot days, stay indoors or in the shade.
(WebMD) -- When the weather's hot and humid, exercising may be the last thing you feel like doing. Believe it or not, though, exercise can be one of the best ways to beat the heat. Whether it's an air-conditioned gym or the cool water of an ocean dive, exercising wisely can save you a lot of suffering.
The great outdoors
Exercising outside during the summer is still an option. Swim in the refreshing waters of a mountain lake or in-line skate on a breezy day. But make sure you take precautions to prevent yourself from getting sunburned and dehydrated.
Use a waterproof sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 and drink at least 4 ounces of water or fluid-replacement beverage for every 20 minutes of exercise.
If you choose to exercise outside, progress into it slowly, giving your body time to adjust to the heat. Exercise during the cooler parts of the day -- first thing in the morning (before 10 a.m.) or after the hot midday hours (after 4 p.m.).
Your heart rate can serve as a good indicator of how your body is tolerating the heat during exercise. On a day of high heat or humidity, your heart will probably beat faster than it usually would doing the same workout. If this happens, it may simply be too hot and humid for you. Slow down or stop what you're doing and hit the local air-conditioned gym.
Staying indoors
Most gyms crank up the air-conditioning during the hot months, making it quite comfortable for workouts. However, if the gym doesn't increase the air, or if you prefer to workout at home, be sure to keep the ventilation going by using a fan or opening the window.
And remember, dehydration can occur even if you're inside and especially if it becomes warm and humid. The more you sweat, the more water you will need to drink. So you may need to drink more than the recommended amount above. In some cases this amount should be doubled.
If air-conditioning is simply not available, take advantage of the heat by doing yoga or stretching. These activities are most effective when the muscle temperature is high.
Water, water, water
Proper hydration is a must. No matter how you choose to exercise or in whatever time of year you choose to do it, your body needs water.
Water accounts for approximately 55 percent to 60 percent of an adult's body weight. While a loss of 10 percent may pose a significant health risk, a loss of 20 percent can result in death.
Because exercise generates internal body heat, which is released and cooled in the form of sweat (water), prolonged exercise with insufficient fluid replacement can lead to dehydration. Some of the warning signs of dehydration include headaches, muscle cramps, lightheadedness, fatigue, confusion, lethargy and a persistently elevated body temperature. Advanced stages of heat exhaustion can lead to coma and cardiac failure.
And don't forget your dog. If you take it along with you for exercise, make sure he or she gets enough water. Dogs overheat more easily because they don't sweat.
