VIEW RESULTS
(CNN) -- Of the 20 U.S. states that carry the death penalty for juvenile murderers, only Texas has used it with frequency -- executing 13 since capital punishment was reinstated.
Texas is ahead of other states by a large margin -- Virginia is second in line with three and Oklahoma, having executed two juvenile killers, comes next.
According to the American Bar Association, 14 states that have juvenile death laws have never carried out such executions. Additionally, 86 percent of the death sentences imposed on juvenile offenders are reversed, the bar association reports.
Of the 21 states that carry a death penalty for juvenile offenders -- defined as someone who committed the crime under the age of 18 -- 16 put the minimum age at 16, the other five at 17.
Historically, Americans are hesitant about sending a juvenile offender to death row.
A 2001 University of Chicago study found 62 percent of those polled supported the death penalty, but only 34 percent supported it for juvenile offenders. A May 2002 Gallup poll showed 72 percent of Americans backed the death penalty, but only 26 percent supported it for juvenile offenders.
The United States continues to come under fire from abroad for state laws allowing execution of juvenile offenders.
International human rights treaties prohibit anyone under 18 years old at the time of the crime being sentenced to death. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights and the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child all have provisions to this effect.
More than 110 countries whose laws still provide for the death penalty for at least some offenses have laws specifically excluding the execution of child offenders or may be presumed to exclude such executions by being parties to one or another of the above treaties.
The United States remains the only country that has failed to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.
It joins the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen as the seven countries known to have executed prisoners who committed a crime under the age of 18 since 1990, according to Amnesty International, a human rights group that opposes the death penalty.
The country that has executed the greatest number of juvenile offenders since 1990 is the United States, with 17, Amnesty International reported.
The number of juvenile killers receiving death sentences in the United States is decreasing, according to Northwestern University's Bluhm Legal Clinic. In 1999, 14 juvenile offenders were sentenced to death, seven in 2001, four in 2002 and so far, one in 2003.

Girl Scout cookie-pushing ethics at the office Story Highlights Selling Girl Scout cookies in the office can be ethically tricky Some workers don't want to be bothered; others think Scouts should handle sales Scout parents worry about the safety of kids going door-to-door to sell cookies About 200 million boxes of Girl Scout cookies are sold each year Next Article in Living » By John D. Sutter CNN	(CNN) -- Sharin Newman Calderon has time to sell Girl Scout cookies. Girl scouts are busy, so their parents are peddling their all-American cookies in the office and online. Her 7-year-old daughter, however, does not. "My daughter has soccer, Hebrew school, karate," the 39-year-old working mother said. "She's busier than I am." So, against the subtle recommendations from the global Girl Scouts organization, Newman Calderon -- and many parents like her -- made a choice: She would sell most of the cookies for her daughter, who then would take the credit. In doing so, she would have to step into an ethically dangerous world. She would have to become an office cookie pusher. There is a flock of 3.7 million Girl Scouts and parents worldwide, according to the group's Web site, and those girls (and their parents) sell about 200 million boxes of cookies each year. While some of those Scouts still trot door to door with sugary treats in tow, many are turning to less-direct sales pitches. Some girls accompany their parents to the office for a captive audience. Others just give their parents a product sheet and pray their well-connected mothers and fathers are skilled enough at hawking the treats to earn them a prize. Don't Miss Why Thin Mints are getting thinner
iReport.com: Thin Mints and offic politics
The ethics of all of these choices can be quite a brain-full. So, for help, CNN.com turned to some experts: office workers and Scout parents everywhere, many of whom first submitted their opinions through iReport, a user-submitted photo and video site powered by CNN. Give us your opinion on Thin Mints and office politics Newman Calderon, who lives in Plainview, New York, said she doesn't like to lay on the hard sell at the office. To avoid making coworkers feel pressured into buying cookies they might not want, she simply leaves a sign-up sheet in an office break room. Everyone in her neighborhood knows a Girl Scout, and therefore has access to their troves of cookies. Her coworkers might not be so lucky, she said. "Especially in this economy, I think it's better to be passive and provide a service," she said. Making her daughter walk through the neighborhood to sell the cookies, which fund the activities of local Girl Scout troops and earn prizes for the girls, would be dangerous and ineffective, Newman Calderon said. But to let her daughter get in on the action, Newman Calderon said she takes her to a local knitting shop. "She can go in and she actually gets to walk around, wear her vest," she said. The benefits of such sales exercises are up for debate among parents of Scouts. Newman Calderon said her daughter is plenty outgoing as it is, and doesn't gain much from having to sell cookies to adults. Girl Scouts of the USA wants its Scouts to make the sales because the interactions boost their confidence and help them learn basic skills like making correct change, said Michelle Tompkins, spokeswoman for the group. But, Tompkins said, the No. 1 priority for the Scouts is safety. Going door-to-door isn't safe for everyone, and while the organization recommends the girls market their cookies online, they shouldn't make the sales that way for safety reasons, she said. So, some Scouts and parents have no choice but to sell in the office, which isn't always popular with coworkers, either because they don't want to be bothered at work or because they have a problem with parents making cookie sales to earn prizes for their daughters. Hilary Ohm, a 51-year-old from Colville, Washington, said parents who sell products for their kids are just "boosting up their kids' egos." Plus, cookies are fattening. If the kids made something to sell or sold healthy foods through farmers markets, Ohm said she would be more inclined to buy. After hearing similar sentiments, some offices have created rules against charitable solicitations in the workplace. Rich Black, a 56-year-old banker in Delaware, said he used to work in one such office. He hated the policy. "What's next?" he asked. "We can't have charities on street corners because we don't know how to say 'No' there?" He added: "If your social skills are at such a low level that you don't know how to say, 'Thank you but no thanks,' there's no set of rules on earth that are going to protect you from life's little bumps," he said. Black, a father of three, also said kids aren't missing out on much if their parents do the cookie marketing for them. "I don't think you're robbing the kids of an experience other than getting doors slammed in their face," he said. Lisa Richardson, a 48-year-old Girl Scout troop leader from Chelsea, Michigan, said there's got to be an ethical middle ground when it comes to selling the cookies. Like Newman Calderon, she leaves a sign-up sheet in her office at the University of Michigan. She and her daughter split the work, with the daughter selling about a third of the 90 boxes of cookies. If her daughter had sold 100 boxes of cookies, she would have won a hair comb, which Richardson said her daughter wants desperately. Richardson said she hopes the efforts of other Scouts in the troop will bump her daughter over the comb-winning benchmark. But if not, her daughter will know to work harder next time. Richardson said it is unfortunate that kids are motivated by prizes to sell the cookies. It would be better, she said, if the fact that her Michigan troop is going to help orphaned animals pushed the girls and the parents to work harder. But perhaps that's just the way of the world, she said. Prizes and money are big motivators.

Commentary: Fan gets town's special tributeStory HighlightsBob Greene: Bill Sauer was a dedicated fan of his small-town football teamHe says Sauer had cerebral palsy and a challenging lifeGreene: Sauer wasn't a football star, a millionaire or a politicianHe says town paid him extraordinary tribute by naming stadium after himNext Article in U.S. » By Bob Greene CNN Contributor	Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is "Late Edition: A Love Story." Bob Greene says Logan, Ohio, paid an extraordinary tribute to its most dedicated football fan. (CNN) -- "Yes, it's all gone now," Craig Dunn told me the other day. "If you're not from around here, you'd never know it was ever there." Dunn is the sports editor of the Logan, Ohio, Daily News, a paper with a small circulation (around 4,000) and a small news staff (five people put the paper out, covering the entire county). Last fall, when I was crisscrossing the country on the CNN Election Express, I spoke with Dunn about the town's high school football stadium, which was being demolished. Bill Sauer Field, it was called. The story I wrote appeared briefly on the Political Ticker and then went away quickly; there was so much rapidly breaking news coming out of the presidential campaign that the story was little more than a blip. Yet I found myself, during the last year, thinking about Bill Sauer Field, and Logan, Ohio, and how it's possible for all of us, if we make the effort, to find the best in ourselves -- to find the best in each other. I find myself thinking about Bill Sauer, and about what that little town did for him, more than I think about almost anything else on which I reported during our long journey through America. And so, with a new football season beginning all across the United States, I spoke with Craig Dunn again the other afternoon. "When I drive by the place where it used to be, it's not with a sense of sadness," he said. "It's with pride for what this town once did." Don't Miss Commentary: The summer that never was
In Depth: Commentaries
Bill Sauer Field was the core of public life in Logan. The town, population 7,300, gravitated to the old stadium on Friday nights in autumns to watch the high school team, the Chieftains, play their games. And who was Bill Sauer? A self-made millionaire from the community who had bestowed the stadium upon the town? A prominent local politician? A long-gone Logan football hero? No. Bill Sauer was born in Logan more than 100 years ago -- in 1908. From the time he was a little boy, he could not walk. He spoke with great difficulty. His parents, desperate, searched for answers. Logan was and is a rural community, and back then sophisticated medical diagnoses were not easy to come by. His mother and father were eventually told that the boy had cerebral palsy. He attended public school in Logan. It was not easy, of course. He was 23 by the time he graduated from Logan High School. Then, as now, the boys who were strong and swift and athletically graceful were the ones most celebrated. Bill could not even take a step on his own. But he loved the Logan sports teams, and he took pride in supporting them. Football, basketball, track and field -- he never missed a game, and he seldom missed a practice session. He would be there on the sidelines, sitting in his wheelchair, cheering for his classmates. His life didn't get any less arduous after he graduated. His father died. It became incumbent upon Bill to support himself and his mother. He sold Christmas cards; he sold magazine subscriptions. At the town's swimming pool, he ran the concessions stand. His philosophy of life, Craig Dunn told me, was basic: However often you get knocked down, you get back up one more time. Bill Sauer grew older. New generations of healthy and talented young athletes played for the Logan Chieftains on Friday nights. No matter the weather, no matter how he was feeling, Bill was always there. The Logan football stadium had been constructed in 1925. It was the heart of the town; it was what made the community feel like a community. In 1975, there was a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the stadium. On that night, it was renamed. For him. For Bill. The whole town had fallen in love with him. All of the quarterbacks who had ever thrown touchdown passes in that stadium, all of the linebackers who had ever made jarring tackles, all of the field goal kickers who had ever won games for Logan as the scoreboard clock ticked down ... and the place was renamed for the boy who could never run a single stride. As the years went by, when visiting teams would come to town, few of the opposing players would have any idea why the stadium in Logan bore the name that it did. That didn't matter. Logan knew. Bill knew. He never married or had a family. He kept going to the games, sitting on the sidelines, right up until his death in 1988. The town, by honoring him the way it did, had given his life meaning, and contentment, and joy. The decades after his death passed; the stadium grew too old, too outmoded. Finally, by last year, there could be no more delay. It was time to tear down Bill Sauer Field. It has vanished now. The new athletic complex -- Logan Chieftain Stadium, it is called -- has risen out near State Route 328. Craig Dunn, the sports editor, spends his Friday nights in the fall covering the games there. Plans are in the works, he said, to erect a plaque at the new stadium in memory of the lifelong fortitude of the town's most faithful fan. "They want the plaque to be in a place where the Logan players can see it as they run onto the field for every game," Dunn said. "They want to make sure that Bill is never forgotten." This can be a mean old world sometimes. But other times, when you least expect it, it can light you up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

Jerusalem (CNN) -- One man died and dozens more were injured Friday as Israeli forces and Palestinian demonstrators clashed in Gaza and the West Bank during protests to mark Land Day, Palestinian medical sources said.
Protesters hurled rocks as Israeli forces fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas at the Qalandia checkpoint, separating the West Bank from Jerusalem.
Seventeen Palestinians were injured during the protest, said the head of the Ramallah medical complex, Dr. Ahmad Bitawi. He said they had suffered moderate injuries from tear gas and rubber bullets.
In Gaza, one man died of his injuries, and 37 people were hurt, two of them critically, in incidents around Beit Hanoun and Khan Yunis, medical sources said.
Palestinians hold Land Day rallies every year to commemorate the deaths of six demonstrators in 1976. The rallies have become an annual expression of what Palestinians consider discriminatory Israeli policies.
Israelis, Palestinians brace on Land Day
This year, Land Day organizers have called for protests inside Israel, in the Palestinian territories, and in neighboring Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.
Rallying under the slogan of a global march to Jerusalem, protest organizers have called for "freedom for Jerusalem and its people."
Israeli forces were placed on high alert as Palestinians and Arabs gathered to observe the day.
The Qalandia checkpoint was among the chief flashpoints Friday.
Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian lawmaker, said he was hit in the head and back by tear gas canisters as he and a group of peaceful protesters were making their way to the checkpoint. He is now at a hospital in Ramallah, he said.
An Israeli military spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, disputed that account, saying the Israel Defense Forces' information indicated that he was hit by another Palestinian in the Qalandia refugee camp as he sought to "convince people to riot."
Israeli military forces sprayed foul-smelling liquid and played ear-piercing sirens as crowd-control measures.
Outbreaks of violence were reported elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza.
Medical sources in Gaza said a number of Palestinians were wounded at the Erez crossing near the town of Beit Hanoun as a result of Israeli fire, most in their lower bodies.
An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said troops fired at the legs of demonstrators who approached the fence and burned tires.
Protesters were also injured by Israeli fire in a demonstration near the town of Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, when they attempted to cross the security fence, Palestinian medical sources said.
An Israeli security official said demonstrators had continued to approach the fence despite being told to move back. Warning shots were fired, followed by live fire when this was ignored, the official said, and one man was shot in the feet.
A Palestinian protester was hit in the head by a tear gas projectile in Bethlehem and was evacuated to Hebron hospital in the West Bank in critical condition, popular committee coordinator Mahmoud Zawahreh said.
Zawahreh said hundreds of Palestinians and international activists had marched toward the Bethlehem checkpoint, trying to walk to Jerusalem peacefully, when they were hit with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades from Israeli forces.
The violence flared when Palestinian youths broke from the Palestinian Authority barricades, reached the crossing that separates Bethlehem from Jerusalem and threw stones, Zawahreh said.
Earlier, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said 300 demonstrators were hurling stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces in Bethlehem, without an Israeli response.
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmulik Ben Rubi said several men were arrested at the Damascus Gate in the Old City for throwing stones at police.
The director of the Palestinian Prisoner Association Club in Jerusalem, Naser Quos, said in a statement that 14 Palestinians, including two children, were arrested by Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem.
In preparation for the Land Day protests, Israel announced a 24-hour closure of the West Bank and imposed restrictions on Friday prayers at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, barring men under age 40 from entering the site.
Thousands of police officers are deployed across the country with an emphasis on the north of Israel and Jerusalem, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
While protest organizers said they would be peaceful, Israeli officials expressed concern that anti-Israel extremists could hijack the rallies.
Israel's police chief, Yohanan Danino, urged leaders of the Arab community to ensure that extremists did not commit provocations.
"We are coordinating the marches that are to take place throughout the day with the heads of the community and hope that things will be quiet without any sporadic incidents," Rosenfeld said.
Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen Benny Gantz held special security assessments Friday with regional deputies along Israel's borders in preparation for the events.
The Israeli army said it would do whatever it took to protect its borders and residents.
Demonstrations marking the anniversary of the Jewish state's creation turned deadly last year when clashes between pro-Palestinian activists and Israeli forces left several dead. The clashes occurred on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the frontier line separating the Golan Heights from Syria.
In southern Lebanon, about 1,000 protesters, most of them Palestinian, gathered by the Crusader-built Beaufort Castle on Friday to mark Land Day. Lebanese flags flew from flagpoles, with one big Hezbollah flag above them all.
"The Arabs have finally woken, and now things will change even there," Muhamed Yusif Abu Shaikh, 67, said outside Sidon as he pointed south, to the border.
Sabri Saidam, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said Land Day for the Palestinians "is a day of mourning and a day of anger representing their eagerness to see the liberation of their land."
Palestinians are demonstrating for their children's right to live in a prosperous, independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.
Land Day "is also a call for the international community to recognize the rights of the Palestinians that have long been confiscated by Israel and the need for the implementation of U.N. resolutions, otherwise the cycle of protest against the occupation will continue."
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said Land Day celebrates a right to freedom.
"The freedom defenders who will partake in these peaceful demonstrations and rallies around the world are marching for dignity toward Jerusalem. Together with them, Palestinians will continue their certain path toward national independence," he said.
CNN's Matthew Chance and Kareem Khadder reported from the West Bank, Ben Wedeman from Lebanon, Talal abu Rahma from Gaza City and Kevin Flower from Jerusalem.

Sorority girl drops 107 pounds
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Polina Marinova, Special to CNN
updated 4:52 PM EST, Wed February 20, 2013
Brittni Garcia began her weight loss journey in 2009 at 235 pounds.
Garcia met her fiance, Nicholas Monreal, through the Greek system at college. When Garcia decided to get fit, their dinner dates became workout dates. Every year Garcia goes to a pumpkin patch with Monreal to celebrate their anniversary. This photo was taken during their 2009 visit. "I love fall and the month of October," she says.
Today Garcia weighs 128 pounds. On the couple's annual trip to the pumpkin patch in October 2012, Garcia carried pumpkins to make up for missing a workout at the gym.
Garcia took this photo in December 2012 after finishing a kettlebell workout. Then 130 pounds, she says, "I was proud of the way my body looked."
"Friday nights are my favorite at the gym," Garcia says. "It's so empty, and I don't have to wait for anything."
Garcia and her sister Savannah Rae Garcia motivate each other daily, Garcia says. Here they do a double plank together.
Garcia completed her first 5K race in 27 minutes in May 2012.
Garcia and her sorority sisters recently completed a 5K obstacle course in Chicago. "It was so fun," Garcia says. "I love that my friends finally embrace my weight loss and my new love for outdoor activities."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Brittni Garcia didn't think her weight was a problem until she couldn't fit into her "fat shorts"
At 235 pounds, Garcia always felt like she stood out from her sorority sisters in college
Garcia shed 107 pounds, and now promotes weight training and a healthy diet

(CNN) -- Brittni Garcia's family didn't go out for walks; they went out for dinner. And when they were at home, they enjoyed watching movies, playing board games and eating big Mexican-style home-cooked meals.
This lazy lifestyle led Garcia to weigh more than 200 pounds by the eighth grade.
"My mom always said, 'You are a big girl. You are just big-boned,'" said the 25-year-old information specialist. "So I just accepted it."
Through high school and college, her weight continued to rise. But even at 235 pounds, Garcia didn't think her weight was a problem -- until she couldn't fit into her "fat shorts" anymore.
Sticking to weight loss goals
Debunking diet myths
160-pound weight loss through pictures
That was December 2009.
It was a typical night for Garcia. She was studying for finals in her sorority house at Eastern Illinois University and wanted to change into some comfortable clothing. She found her red pajama XXL shorts that she normally wore to bed.
As she struggled to pull them up, she realized they were too tight and uncomfortable -- her "big, comfy shorts" no longer fit.
"Tons of emotions ran through my head," she said. "I was afraid that was the way my life was going to be."
That's when Garcia's mentality changed. Being overweight was no longer normal for her.
Heart disease runs in her family, and she realized it was time to address her weight now before it turned into a bigger health problem.
"I wanted to lose weight to challenge myself and show myself I can change, and not change for the world," Garcia wrote in her iReport. "This time, it was for me."
Getting in shape wasn't going to be easy. Going to the gym had been one of her biggest fears for a long time. She was self-conscious about how she looked and sounded when she ran.
"It was hard for me to breathe," Garcia said. "It was embarrassing."

Embarrassment about her weight extended to other areas of her life. Although she was president of her sorority, Garcia always felt like she stood out.
"All the sorority girls had cookie-cutter form, and I looked different," she said. "It was really hard for me to connect."
Garcia's involvement in Greek life perpetuated her unhealthy habits; she often went to bars and restaurants to mingle with her college friends. It was difficult to break the cycle, but she found supportive friends who also hit the gym.
"What I tell people is that you find new friends at the gym," she said. "If you don't have the support, it's really hard to do it on your own."
Garcia found one of her biggest supporters through her sorority. She met Nicholas Monreal at a Greek function, and they began dating when she was at her heaviest. But the days of social functions, bar visits and restaurant outings are long gone for the couple.
"He was there when I realized I wanted to change," she said. "To this day, our dates are to the gym. We see excitement in going on walks and runs."
The couple has been together for four years; he proposed in December. Monreal has noticed a significant difference in Garcia over the past few years -- not just physically.
"She's more energetic ... and she's more willing to try new things," he said "She's just working very hard, and she's a better person for it."
On the right track
Since the beginning of 2010, Garcia has lost 107 pounds.
There were setbacks, the biggest of which came this past August when she was in a car accident. She completed three months of physical therapy and wasn't able to go to the gym and do her daily routines for a month and a half.
She was angry at first -- mad at the person who hit her car and stalled her progress at the gym.
But she got over her initial anger, and Garcia went on a walk. This time, she wasn't alone. Her fiance, her parents, her sisters and her aunt encouraged her to stay active. As a result, Garcia went on walks with them and did yoga at a gym.

After getting back on track with her daily workouts, Garcia realized she also had to better manage her eating habits.
"For the longest, I would go to the gym and go home to eat whatever I wanted," she said. "That's not how it works. I had to learn to eat differently and to learn to like new foods."
She started doing research on proper nutrition. She read books and online articles, shopped at health foods stores and learned to prepare meals that helped her maintain a healthy diet.
Now for two hours every Sunday, Garcia grills chicken, cooks vegetables and packs fresh fruit in preparation for the upcoming week.
"(I) make eating as simple as possible," she said. "If there are a lot of ingredients, I don't want it."
The next step
Down to 128 pounds, Garcia has been left with a lot of loose skin -- particularly around her stomach. She is doing CrossFit exercises and weight training to tighten up the area.
She's also checking off some other goals.
One of the most rewarding moments in Garcia's weight loss journey was completing her first 5K run in 27 minutes.
When she first started training, running three miles took her 48 minutes. Today, she can complete it in less than 25.
"I hadn't been able to walk a lap, let alone run it," she said. "And now when I finish a workout, I really get emotional and I can't believe that I could do it."
She isn't stopping there. Garcia wants to complete a half marathon as well as the Warrior Dash in June. As a result, she might take a pool break in between.
"I really want to fit in my bikini comfortably this summer," she said.
Today, Garcia doesn't shop at plus size clothing stores anymore. She was able to drop from a size 22 to a size 6.
And what happened to her XXL "fat shorts?" She ditched them for a pair of small exercise shorts.
To those just starting their weight-loss journey, she offers this advice:
"Once you start, don't give up. The hardest thing to do is to continue. If you have a bad day, don't make it a bad week."

Ex-porn star Jenna Jameson charged with battery
From Tresha Lindo, CNN
updated 10:52 AM EDT, Mon April 8, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The victim makes a citizen's arrest and calls officers
Police does not know the relationship between the victim and Jameson
The battery charge is a misdemeanor
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former porn star Jenna Jameson was charged with battery over the weekend after police said she assaulted someone.
The incident took place in Orange County on Saturday evening, police said.
Authorities released bare-bones information about the incident Sunday night, saying little more than the person who was assaulted made a citizen's arrest and called officers.
Jameson, 38, knows the person, but Newport Beach Police Lt. Evan Sailor said he didn't know what their relationship was.
James Deen co-stars with Lindsay Lohan in "The Canyons," playing Christian, a "film producer who enjoys filming his own three-way sex sessions," according to IndieWire. Deen has gained quite a fan following for his boy-next-door look and has been profiled by GOOD magazine and ABC's "Nightline". We take a look at some other adult movie stars who have transitioned into mainstream Hollywood.
Sasha Grey made her entrance in the pornographic film industry just after she had turned 18. By 21, she had become a veteran and won several Adult Video News awards. Then in 2008, Steven Soderberg cast Grey in the feature film "The Girlfriend Experience." Since then she has starred in "Smash Cut," modeled for American Apparel, started her own industrial music group and even had a brief supporting role in "Entourage" in 2010. In April 2011, Grey announced her retirement from porn and is scheduled to appear in several upcoming films.
Ron Jeremy, also known as "The Hedgehog," is considered one of the most successful porn stars in the industry. Adult Video News even named him the No. 1 porn star of all time. While Jeremy holds the Guinness World Record for starring in more than 2,000 adult films, he has also starred in mainstream movies such as "The Boondock Saints" and "The Chase." In 2008, he released a book about his career, "The Hardest (Working) Man in Showbiz: Horny Women, Hollywood Nights & The Rise of the Hedgehog!" He recently spoke with CNN about his return to work after a heart scare.
Before Jenna Jameson starred in her first pornographic film in 1993, she had been a dancer at a strip club and had posed in Hustler, Penthouse and Cheri. By 1996, she had become a well-known star and got a minor role in Howard Stern's feature film "Private Parts." Since then, this former "queen of porn" has done guest voice-over work for "Family Guy" and has released a New York Times best-selling autobiography and created a horror comic book. Traci Lords was underage when she appeared in her first pornographic movie. She went on to make more than 100 adult films by the time she was 18 and even stripped for Penthouse magazine. Lords was eventually arrested and many of her "hits" became illegal. She left the industry and would go on to appear B-movies and TV shows such as "Roseanne," "Melrose Place," "Married... With Children," "MacGyver" and "Gilmore Girls." Lords also had roles in movies "Virtuosity" and "Blade."
Jenna Haze broke into the pornography industry in 2001 at the age of 19. She went on to win numerous adult film awards, including multiple female performer of the year awards. In 2007 Haze had a small role in "Superbad" and then launched her own production company in 2009. She announced her retirement in 2012 and recently appeared in a photo shoot for FHM magazine with Taylor Momsen.
Ginger Lynn got her start in pornographic movies in the mid-1980s. Around the early '90s, she quit and made appearances in several B-movies and mainstream ones such as "Young Guns II" with Keifer Sutherland and Emilio Estevez. Then in 1999, Lynn returned to the adult film industry and starred in a porn film with James Deen in 2008. She has been ranked No. 7 in Adult Video News' greatest porn stars of all time list.

Porn stars who've gone mainstream
Police took Jameson to the Newport Beach Police Jail. She was later released without having to post bail.
The battery charge is a misdemeanor.
No one from the Jameson camp was available for comment.
On Sunday afternoon, however, Jameson took to Twitter to offer a post that said she was robbed by a friend who "broke into my home and took everything."
Jameson added that the friend "accused me of gusting her."
At the height of her success, Jameson was an industry unto herself. She appeared in countless adult films, magazines, and strip clubs -- and as CEO of ClubJenna Inc., launched a film production and online licensing company.
In a 2004 interview with CNN following the publication of her book, "How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale," Jameson said she chose the right profession.
"I mean, I've always been so overtly sexual. And I've always been driven to succeed at something that hasn't always been accepted by the American public," she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "So I think I chose the right profession."
She retired from porn in 2008.
In recent years, the mother of twins has found herself in the headlines for her brushes with the law.
Last May, she crashed her Range Rover into a light pole in Orange County. Police charged her with driving under the influence.
In April 2010, the father of her twin boys, mixed martial artist Tito Ortiz, was charged with domestic violence when Jameson's father called police as Ortiz and Jameson argued.
Ortiz and his lawyer told reporters later that he was upset because he thought Jameson had relapsed in her rehabilitation from a prescription drug addiction.
Four days after the incident, Jameson was captured by cameras alternately saying Ortiz was "the sweetest, most amazing man" and saying that he had beaten her.

Zambian men arrested over alleged homosexual acts By Faith Karimi, CNN
updated 4:25 AM EDT, Thu May 9, 2013
Philip Mubiana (covering his face) and James Mwape (left) arrive at the Kapiri magistrate court on May 8, 2013 in Lusaka. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Authorities subject them to anal examinations without their consent, a rights group says
Amnesty International: It was the second detention for the two men in recent days Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries
(CNN) -- Zambian police rearrested two men this week on charges of engaging in homosexual acts "against the order of nature," a rights group said.
James Mwansa and Philip Mubiana, both 21, were arrested after neighbors reported them to the police, according to Amnesty International.
Authorities subjected them to anal examinations without their consent and forced them to confess, the human rights group said.
"Anal examinations conducted to 'prove' same-sex conduct are scientifically invalid, and if they were conducted without the men's consent, contravene the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment under international law," said Simeon Mawanza, an Amnesty researcher in Zambia.
It was the second detention for the two men in recent days, the group said. Last month, authorities arrested them, and later released them on bail on May 2.
They were arrested again Monday and have been denied bail, according to Amnesty. Both have pleaded not guilty, and are being held at a jail in Kapiri Mposhi until their trial starts May 22.
"The arrest of the two men solely for their real or perceived sexual orientation amounts to discrimination and it is in violation of their rights to freedom of conscience, expression and privacy," Mawanza said.
Zambian officials were not immediately available for comment.
Homosexuality is illegal in Zambia and most African countries based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs.
Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison.
Last year, a Cameroon appeals court upheld a three-year sentence against a man convicted of homosexuality for texting his male friend to say, "I'm very much in love with you."
South Africa -- one of the more progressive nations in the continent on the issue -- was the first African country to impose a constitutional ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation.
But sexual violence against lesbians has become so common in South Africa, the nation has coined the term "corrective rape" to describe it.
A handful of other nations issue a death penalty for consensual same-sex relations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.

Egypt's military moves to allay fears of instability
By Reza Sayah, Chelsea J. Carter and Tom Watkins, CNN
updated 8:58 PM EDT, Tue July 9, 2013
A bus passes a destroyed pickup truck with loudspeakers that was used by supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on Friday, August 2. The supporters and security forces clashed in Sixth of October City in Giza, south of Cairo, after the government ordered their protest camps be broken up. Look at the latest violence in Egypt.
Morsy supporters walk past makeshift roadblocks at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo on Saturday, August 3. Security forces set up the roadblocks outside the square, allowing people to leave but not enter, as they attempt to break up camps set up during ongoing protests over Morsy's ouster. Morsy supporters run among the smoke and fire resulting from clashes with security forces in Sixth of October City in Giza on August 2. The military ousted Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, in early July after days of mass demonstrations. Dozens of Morsy backers angry at Egypt's military-backed government have died in weekend violence in the volatile nation's capital. See photos of protests that have engulfed the country.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Cabinet posts will be offered to the Muslim Brotherhood, Salafists
The decree would grant Adly Mansour limited legislative powers
No deadline is set for the announcement of a new government
The declaration outlines a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections
Are you in Egypt? Send us your experiences, but please stay safe. Read a version of this story in Arabic.
Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian Armed Forces sought Tuesday to portray itself as a stabilizing force fully capable of handling the anger and unrest that have divided the nation less than a week after overthrowing the first democratically elected president.
"Destruction of public property or the stability of the state will not be tolerated," the military said in an audio statement broadcast on state television. "A constitutional declaration has been issued and the road to transition is clear, so people should feel secure."
The announcement came a day after 51 people were killed in clashes between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military over the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsy and as the fledgling new government announced it had filled key roles.
Hazem El-Beblawi, a liberal economist who was finance minister and deputy prime minister, will serve as the interim prime minister; Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning diplomat, will serve as interim vice president, it said.
Cabinet posts also will be offered to the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, as well as to the Salafist al-Nour Party, MENA, Egypt's official news agency, reported.

Writer: Morsy unwilling to be inclusive
Tensions high in Egypt
ElBaradei: Morsy's ouster was needed so Egypt cannot 'fail'
The military's projection of confidence contrasted with the mood that surrounded a demonstration outside the Raba'a Al-Adawiya Mosque in Cairo, where thousands of people packed a square, some of them waving the country's red, white and black flag and others holding aloft pictures of Morsy.
The Brotherhood's highest official of religious law said Tuesday he does not recognize the authority of the nation's interim president and will not negotiate until Morsy regains power.
What is the Muslim Brotherhood?
After that happens, "we will have a national and comprehensive reconciliation in which all the problems can be discussed over a negotiation table but through a prior constitution," Grand Mufti Abdulruhman Albir told the Reuters news agency.
He said he recognized neither last week's military coup nor any of the moves by those who have seized power. "Therefore, there is no need to speak about any decrees, because they were issued by people without authority."
Albir was referring to Interim President Adly Mansour, who had issued a constitutional declaration giving himself limited power to make laws and outlined a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections, according to state media.
Adly Mansour: Interim president, veteran judge, mystery man
There was no official word on the decree from the president's office.
Egypt after Morsy: Turbulent transition Egypt's FM: Elections in 7 months More than 50 dead in Egypt clashes
If the state media reports are accurate, the 33-article decree would grant Mansour limited legislative powers after consultation with a cabinet, which would wield veto power.
The decree also would lay out a timeline for voting on an amended constitution and for holding parliamentary and president ballots.
The declaration calls for a constitutional referendum in November, followed by parliamentary elections in December and a presidential poll in February.
Without confirmation from the president's office, it is impossible to say whether the reports -- carried by state-run Al-Ahram and MENA -- are accurate.
Also on Tuesday, funerals were held for the victims of clashes between the Brotherhood and security forces on Monday -- the deadliest day in Cairo since the revolution that forced then-President Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011.
The interim Egyptian government announced Tuesday that it would investigate the violence.
The White House has refused to describe as a coup the military's ouster of Morsy, who was reportedly being held under arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters. Doing so would require the United States to suspend its $1.3 billion in annual military aid to Egypt.
When is a coup not a coup?
It is in the interest of the United States and the Egyptian people "in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination," White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.
But he added that U.S. officials were "cautiously encouraged" that the interim government's plan "includes a return to democratically elected government that includes presidential and parliamentary elections."
In response to a question, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters that, "broadly speaking," the administration still believes that continuing military aid is a U.S. national security priority.
But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, has called for a suspension of military aid to Egypt.
Some financial heavyweights in the region have offered financial assistance of their own. Saudi Arabia's finance minister said the kingdom has pledged $5 billion in grants and loans to the interim government, according to the official Saudi news agency SAPA, and the United Arab Emirates will give $1 billion to Egypt and lend it another $2 billion as an interest-free central bank deposit, state news agency WAM reported Tuesday.

Questions to ask for New Year
By Eric Liu updated 4:51 PM EST, Fri December 27, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Eric Liu: I've been working with creative thinkers who are mining the meaning of a good life
Liu: This New Year's, resolve to reflect on your life
Here are a list of questions to ask yourself, including who are your influences, aspirations Liu: The questions were originally developed for young people, but they're really for all Editor's note: Eric Liu is the founder of Citizen University and author of several books, including "The Gardens of Democracy" and "The Accidental Asian." He served as a White House speechwriter and policy adviser for President Bill Clinton. Follow him on Twitter @ericpliu
(CNN) -- Here's a New Year's resolution that's easy to keep, good for your health and beneficial for your relationships. And it won't cost you a penny. Sound too good to be true? Read on.
In recent months, I've been working with a group of creative thinkers who are mining the meaning of a good life. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Bill Damon and Howard Gardner are renowned psychologists who've collaborated to create the Good Project, which explores the behaviors and mindsets that add up to good work, good play and good citizenship.
Together, with Lynn Barendsen, we've developed a simple set of questions for the New Year. They're catalysts for reflection rather than formulas for imitation. Their purpose is to get us thinking about our purpose, in both private and community life.
Eric Liu
We originally developed these questions for young people, on the belief that the new generation doesn't get enough structured opportunities to explore meaning and values. But the truth is, it's not just millennials today who might lack purpose, feel uncertain about shared beliefs and goals or wish they could be part of something greater than themselves. It's people of all ages.
We Americans rarely get to make a truly mindful assessment of who we are, what's shaped us and why we hope to change. If we did that first, we'd probably be more capable of making wise resolutions and keeping them. We'd become more conscious of the web of relationship and mutual obligation that holds us together and that makes our freedom truly worth cherishing. And we might just end up being better humans.
So I invite you, whatever your stage of life, to explore these questions. Ask them of yourself. Talk with family and friends about them. Write and share your reflections. Feel free to adapt and revise the questions to suit your circumstances. And let us know on Twitter what the experience is like for you and those close to you.
If you make it your first resolution to consider these questions well, your other resolutions will almost certainly end up being more honest, more meaningful to you and more useful to others. Enjoy reflecting, and may your new year be happy -- and deeply good.
Who you are
1. Think of something (an activity, a job) to which you're really committed and that takes up a lot of your time. Why do you do it? Do you consider it time well spent? Why or why not? What would make you stop being involved?
2. Who or what do you consider your community? What do you do for the community? What would you expect the community to do it for you?
3. To whom or what do you feel responsible? What does that entail? What happens when you don't meet that responsibility?
4. Are you a good worker? A good citizen? A good person? How do you distinguish among them? Which is most important to you?
Influences
5. Who's influenced you, and how do you pass it on?
6. What individuals and institutions do you admire and why (current or past)?
7. What/whom don't you admire and why?
8. What and whom do you love?
Aspirations
9. What would it mean for you to be successful? How important is recognition, through money or esteem? What about unheralded acts or contributions?
10. What would it mean for you fail? Who or what will make that judgment for you and about you?
11. What kind of person do you want to be right now?
12. What should -- and shouldn't -- be written in your obituary?
