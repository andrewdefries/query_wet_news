(CNN) -- Continental Airlines has canceled Sunday's Flight 17 from Glasgow, Scotland, to Los Angeles, California, because of security concerns, a spokesman for the carrier told CNN on Saturday.
"The flight was canceled because we were unable to obtain the necessary security clearances from the Department of Homeland Security and their international counterparts," David Messing said, reading from a statement released by the airline.
Flight 17 included a stop in Newark, New Jersey.
British Airways and Air France had previously grounded several flights to the United States for security reasons in the wake of possible al Qaeda terror threats involving U.S.-bound aircraft.
British Airways canceled Flight 223 from London's Heathrow Airport to Washington Dulles International Airport on Sunday and Monday, and Flight 207 from London's Heathrow to Florida's Miami International Airport on Sunday.
The return flights from Washington -- Flight 222 -- also will be canceled both days, but the return flights from Miami will continue.
The flights were canceled for security reasons on advice from the British government, an airline spokeswoman said.
Air France canceled two Paris-to-Washington flights for security reasons, the airline said. The flights, both numbered 026, were scheduled to take off Sunday and Monday. The return flights, 027, have been canceled because the aircraft will not be available.
Continental's spokesman didn't elaborate on the cancellation. Messing said 150 passengers were booked on the flight, which would have left Glasgow at 12:15 p.m. and arrived in Los Angeles at 8:35 p.m. (11:35 p.m. ET), after the layover in Newark.
The return flight to Glasgow also will be canceled because there will be no plane available.
A senior U.S. official said the flight was canceled because of information from a credible source, which was corroborated by other intelligence.
The official said someone from the Department of Homeland Security had talked to the airline about security measures. Continental uses air marshals; he would not say whether Continental had planned to have marshals on Flight 17.
The official said the United States does not know how terrorists might attack the planes that have been grounded, but "we know they're targeting these flights."
He also said there is word about another threat that could ground British Airways Flight 223, but no action is planned until there is more information.
"The steps taken today are to preserve our security and to make sure that terrorists don't do harm to the United States or our allies," White House spokesman Trent Duffy said. The United States, Britain and France conferred on the cancellations.
Flight 378 from Paris to Philadelphia International Airport was canceled Saturday for operational, not security, reasons, according to the Air France Web site.
Spokeswomen from British Airways and Air France declined to elaborate on the cancellations.
The moves come as U.S. officials again warn that terrorists might be planning to target international flights to the United States. (Full story)
A senior administration official said Saturday the intelligence that prompted the latest warning gives precise threat information, including airlines, dates and flight numbers.
The intelligence mentioned Air France and British Airways flights to the United States as well as British Airways Flight 223 specifically. That flight was canceled twice in early January based on previous intelligence from an informant and other sources.
Last month, similar threats prompted the cancellation of three Air France flights to Los Angeles, California, on Christmas Eve and Christmas. The return flights were canceled for operational reasons.
At the time, the U.S. national terror threat level was at orange, or high, on the color-coded alert system. The threat level has since been lowered to yellow, or elevated.
British Airways said Flight 207 would have carried 350 passengers and Flight 223 about 170 passengers. Those passengers are being rerouted.
British Airways aircraft sit on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport in London.
Britain's Department for Transport, which advises the airline on security matters, issued a statement on the cancellations:
"Aviation security is being kept under review at all times. In the light of information received, and in discussion with the airline, the decision was made that these flights should be canceled," the agency said.
"Aviation security measures are adjusted from time to time, and occasional cancellations may be necessary. The first priority is always the safety of the traveling public."
A U.S. State Department spokesman told CNN that the United States and Britain "have been working especially closely over the past weeks to identify threats to our citizens, particularly threats to civil aviation, and to develop procedures to counter those threats."
The spokesman said the information relates only to specific flights, not carriers or transatlantic flights in general.
"In some instances, where specific flights may be a higher risk, the carrier or the UK government may choose to cancel those flights. We will in any case work with the UK authorities to assure the continued safety of all carriers on all loops between the US and the UK," the spokesman said.
Also Saturday, a burning smell caused a Virgin Atlantic Airways flight from London to New York to return to Heathrow as a safety precaution more than two hours after it took off, the airline said. (Full story)
The flight was headed to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Passengers were put on later flights.
CNN's Kelli Arena, John King and Jamie McIntyre contributed to this report.

FDA warns makers of unapproved narcoticsStory Highlights FDA warns manufacturers they have 60 days to pull unapproved drugs from market Officials don't know if drugs are unsafe; they have never been approved Removing unapproved drugs not expected to create a shortage of pain relievers Next Article in Health » By Val Willingham CNN Medical Producer	WHITE OAK, Maryland (CNN) -- Seeking to remove unapproved drugs from the marketplace, the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered nine companies to stop manufacturing narcotics whose therapeutic claims have not been proved. The FDA ordered nine companies to stop selling unapproved drugs marketed for pain relief. The FDA's warning letters notified the companies they may be subject to legal action if they do not stop manufacturing and distributing "prescription unapproved products" that include high-concentrate morphine sulfate oral solutions and immediate-release tablets containing morphine sulfate, hydromorphone or oxycodone. This action does not include oxycodone capsules. All of these drugs are used for pain relief and are forms of previously approved medications. The agency says this is not a recall, but is instead a warning to manufacturers. The companies have 60 days to pull these pain-relief drugs from the market. Distributors have 90 days to stop shipping them. If these drugs are not off the market by those deadlines, a company could face seizure of the narcotics and legal action. "We estimate there are several hundred unapproved drugs out there," said Deborah Autor, director of the office of compliance within the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "We will continue to take aggressive action against those firms that do not have the required FDA approval for their drugs. Today's warning letters are another demonstration of our commitment to remove illegal, unproved drugs from the market." Don't Miss FDA says India plant falsified generic drug data 'Natural' weight-loss supplements may be a health hazard
Although the FDA does not know whether these drugs are unsafe, it has not approved them so cannot certify that the products are 100 percent safe and effective. "Consumers have a right to expect that their drugs meet the FDA's safety and effectiveness standards," said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Doctors and patients are often unaware that not all drugs on the market are backed by FDA approval. It is a high priority for the FDA to remove these products from the market because they may be unsafe, ineffective, inappropriately labeled, or of poor quality." The FDA believes Americans have access to plenty of legal narcotics for pain relief and removing these unapproved drugs will not create a shortage. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Health A-Z
Consumers who may be concerned that they are taking any unapproved drug products should refer to the FDA's Unapproved Drugs Web page, which includes a list of manufacturers of these products. Those who find they are taking unapproved drugs should see their health care professionals for treatment options. Those companies receiving warning letters are Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc., Columbus, Ohio; Cody Laboratories Inc., Cody, Wyoming; Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mahwah, New Jersey; Lannett Company Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Lehigh Valley Technologies Inc., Allentown, Pennsylvania; Mallinckrodt Inc. Pharmaceuticals Group, St. Louis, Missouri; Physicians Total Care Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma; Roxane Laboratories Inc., Columbus, Ohio; and Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals Inc., Newport, Kentucky.

Vancouver medals in condom distribution By Jessica Ravitz, CNN With an emergency shipment included, more than 100,000 condoms were distributed at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. STORY HIGHLIGHTSOther may want a recount, but it seems Vancouver's tops for Winter Games condoms More than 100,000 rubbers were distributed; 8,500 more were sent as backup Since 1992 Barcelona Olympics, condoms have been free for athletes at gamesHealth official proud of distribution, but hears Rio gave out 35 million at Mardi Gras
RELATED TOPICS
2010 Winter Olympics
Vancouver
(CNN) -- The medals have been presented, the caldron extinguished and the crowds dispersed, but there's one record from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics that may have been overlooked: Most condoms distributed at a Winter Games. It's hard to say this conclusively, and judges from other host cities may demand a recount, but Clay Adams of Vancouver Coastal Health said the word on the public health street is that Vancouver is king of the prophylactic winter rings. Over the course of 17 days, the health agency doled out 100,000 condoms, supplied by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. And after buzz, some based on rumors, grew that there was a shortage -- "We were not getting calls from people saying, 'Help, I need condoms,'" Adams laughed -- an emergency shipment of 8,500 additional rubbers came in from the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research. Some media outlets reported that the supply was strictly for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and officials, totaling about 6,500 people according to the Vancouver Organizing Committee. That would suggest an average of at least 15 condoms per person, and rampant sex of Olympic proportions. But Adams, spokesman for Vancouver Coastal Health, clarified and said the free condoms were available not just to athletes and game officials. They were on the cruise ships that housed security, support staff and volunteers. They were in washrooms at public venues, including the downtown pavilions where visitors gathered for free concerts. They were handed out by volunteers and readily available in clinics. The mass distribution of rubbers was part of a greater effort to improve HIV and AIDS awareness, Adams said. Lots of people don't have the same kind of access to public health messages about disease prevention, and "when you've got a global audience like this, it's a huge opportunity to educate the world," he said. Since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, condoms have been distributed free to athletes. About 40,000 of the original 100,000 in Vancouver were for those staying in the athlete villages in Vancouver and Whistler, Adams said. How many of them were actually used is an impossible question to answer. Some say condoms were snagged as souvenirs, although Adams said they were not branded with Olympic rings. He said he did hear stories of athletes from countries with inferior condoms stuffing their suitcases with the coveted rubbers. But no matter what happened to the condoms, the public health effort in Vancouver is one that makes him proud. "Indications are that Vancouver topped the podium for Winter Olympics," Adams said. "Although we recently heard that they issued 35 million condoms for Mardi Gras in Rio, so I suppose we all have a long, long way to go to reach that mark."

12 arrested in France for terrorist links, police say From Winnie Andrews, CNN Arrests in France anti-terror raidsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSThe arrests happened across southern FranceThree have links to a French man arrested on terrorism charges in Italy, police sayNone of the 12 has been charged Paris, France (CNN) -- Police arrested 12 people in the south of France Tuesday for having links to terrorist networks, French national police said. Three of those detained have links to a French man arrested in Italy early last month, whose extradition France has requested, police said. Two of them were arrested in Marseille and the third was arrested in Bordeaux. The nine other arrests happened throughout southern France, including some in Marseille and at least one in Avignon, police said. Marseille police said the nine have links to an Islamist movement and were suspected of trying to obtain arms and explosives. It was unclear whether those arrested were French citizens. None of them has been charged. Under French law, police have six days to question them before charges must be filed. Italian police said last month they detained a French citizen of Algerian origin suspected of being a member of the terror group al Qaeda. He was arrested by Italian police in Naples on a European arrest warrant requested by France, the Naples chief prosecutor told CNN at the time. Didier Allard of the Palais de Justice appeals court identified the man as Riahd Hennouni and said an anti-terror judge in Paris had requested his arrest. France requested his extradition from Italy, Allard said.

Obama signs bill to grant Nigerian student U.S. permanent residency By Faith Karimi, CNN
updated 7:38 AM EST, Sat December 29, 2012
Victor Chukwueke (second from the left) is shown with his surgeon, Dr. Ian Jackson, the doctor's wife and the nun who has cared for him since he came to the United States.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Victor Chukwueke's visa expires after he comes to the U.S. for treatment of face tumors He plans to attend an Ohio medical school that requires him to have a green card A Michigan senator introduces a private bill to grant him a green card In a rare act, Congress passes the bill this month (CNN) -- A Nigerian immigrant's dream came true when President Barack Obama signed into law a rare private bill granting him permanent residency in the Unites States.
Victor Chukwueke, who lives in Michigan on an expired visa, came to the United States 11 years ago to undergo treatment for massive face tumors.
He graduated from a university in the state, and plans to attend an Ohio medical school that requires him to have permanent residency, also known as a green card.
In a rare act, the United States Congress passed a private bill this month granting him permanent residency. Obama signed the bill Friday.
Private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- are rarely approved. His is the only one to pass in Congress in two years.
"I was overwhelmed with joy; it was nothing less than a miracle," the 26-year-old says. "Only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like me."
Victor Chukwueke attends his graduation at Wayne State University, where he served as commencement speaker.
Only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like meVictor Chukwueke
Before coming to the United States at age 15, Chukwueke lived in the southeastern Nigeria town of Ovim.
He suffers from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes massive life-threatening tumors on his face.
Treated as an outcast because of his deformed face, he was depressed and humiliated, he says. His family abandoned him at an orphanage after taking him to the nation's best facilities for treatment.
"I went to a large teaching hospital in Nigeria and the doctor touched my face and said there was nothing they could do," he says. " I cried and begged him to do something. I was so tired of the humiliation."
Nuns from the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy rescued him from the orphanage in 2001 and arranged for a Michigan doctor to perform surgery on him.
He considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors.
"Without them, I would not have met the nun, left Nigeria, arrived in the U.S. and had the miracle to attend medical school," he says.
He lives with the nuns in Oak Park, Michigan. They have cared for him since he came to the U.S., where he has undergone seven surgeries, including one that left him blind in the right eye.
Despite the obstacles, he remains committed to getting an education.
He finished his GED -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college.
A benefactor helped him attend Wayne State University, where he graduated last year with a bachelor's in biochemistry and chemical biology. He had a 3.82 GPA and gave the university's commencement speech.
"Should I call myself a victim, or should I press forward to my dreams?" he asked during the speech amid thunderous applause.
Soon after his graduation, the University of Toledo in Ohio admitted him to medical school. The only hurdle: The program requires him to have permanent residency status.
With Obama's signature, his wish has come true.
"My own personal struggles to receive treatment have motivated and encouraged me to pursue a medical career ... to alleviate the pain and suffering of others," he says. "A medical career will allow me many gratifying years of making a difference in the health and lives of others."
Chukwueke's journey to get legalized has seen many strangers rally to his help.
Inspired by his story, Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, sponsored the bill, S. 285. The measure passed the Senate in the summer and the House this week.
Attorney Thomas K. Ragland took his case pro bono.
"Victor's story is remarkable," says Ragland, who is based in Washington D.C. "Here is this kid who comes from Nigeria, he was taunted and teased for his diseases, and he comes to this country and excels, despite so many surgeries. It is a testament of not letting anything get in the way."
The number of illegal immigrants in the United States was estimated at 11.5 million last year.
Following the signature, the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians.

GOP, play offense in Obama's second term By William J. Bennett, Special to CNN
updated 9:33 AM EST, Wed January 23, 2013
John Boehner, left, and Mitch McConnell in 2012. We can't just blame the Republican leadership, says William Bennett. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
William Bennett: Here is some advice for the GOP in the second Obama term Bennett: Don't just blame GOP leadership; the choice of the people also matters
He says conservatives must win the cultural war to change political institutions Bennett: The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished for it
Editor's note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of "The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.
(CNN) -- If President Barack Obama's inaugural address was any indication, his second term will be a doubling down of the progressive, big government agenda.
With that in mind, here is some advice for conservatives and the Republican Party for the next four years of Obama's presidency:
Don't blame the GOP leadership William Bennett
First and foremost, if we are to prevail, we cannot afford to continue firing upon and wounding or maiming our own soldiers and officers. We need everyone in the fight.
It is more difficult to be in a position of governance, such as John Boehner, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, than a journalist, pundit or conservative talk show host. Trust me, I've been in both arenas. It's much harder to be Boehner and the Republican leadership than it is to be Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Medved, etc.
Unlike those who operate solely in the arenas of commentary, opinion and philosophy, Republicans in Washington bear the responsibility and burden of actual governance, where ideological purity must often yield to compromise. Much of the blame placed at the feet of Republican leadership by many in the party or the commentariat lies not with the party or its leaders but ultimately, as in all things with a democratic republic, with the choice of the people.

Face reality William Buckley aptly described conservatism as the politics of reality. As such, we must recognize the realities of political governance. You cannot govern unless you have power. That is, Republicans cannot govern with control of only one half of one third of the branches of government.
They can block and prevent, but they cannot impose. Our agenda, our goals and our expectations should be oriented to these facts of reality.
House GOP blinks in debt ceiling fight
It's the culture, stupid
Conservatives are losing the culture war when, according to a 2011 Pew Research poll, 49% of Americans ages 18-29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46% have a positive view of capitalism. Such views are the products of our education system and the movies, music and entertainment young Americans consume. We must change those cultural institutions before we can truly change our political institutions in the long term.
The roots of our cultural and educational outreach must be as far reaching as the left's. This means broadening our scope of influence outside Fox News and conservative talk radio and into the left's strongholds of Hollywood and higher education. Perhaps some of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on PACs could be better spent taking back the culture.
Play offense
In politics, as in sports, you're either on offense or you're on defense. Be on offense. This is a simple maxim, but one too often neglected.
He who initiates sets the terms of debate and forces the dialogue on his terms. Gov. Scott Walker's aggressive fiscal reforms in Wisconsin are an example of effective political offense.
Elevate the next generation During the 2012 presidential primaries, conservatives often lamented the absence of rising Republican stars such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. Susana Martinez, Gov. Scott Walker, Rep. Paul Ryan and so on. Our bench is strong, but now it's time for the bench to take the field.
Politics: After inauguration, political reality returns to Washington
Consequences of big government The American people must realize for what they voted when they re-elected Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate. So far, they've been immunized from many of the consequences. But now, with the expiration of the payroll tax cut and the gradual implementation of ObamaCare, the taxes of almost all Americans have risen, along with many of their health care premiums.
Conservatives must draw the direct link between higher taxes and premiums and Democratic policies. As St. Paul instructs, misery teaches lessons that success doesn't. The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished and made to pay for it in immiseration.
Don't become cynical Do not make people more cynical or pessimistic about politics or the political system. Every day on my radio show, I hear of people withdrawing from the political arena into a cocoon of disengagement and discouragement. We cannot allow this to happen.
We must encourage the American people to be active and involved in important policy decisions.
It was the great novelist Walker Percy who warned of America's downfall, not at the hand of a great outside power, but from crumbling within.
Politics: Republicans assess Obama's address
"Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom ... gradually subside into decay through default and be defeated, not by the communist movement, but from within, from weariness, boredom, cynicism, greed and in the end helplessness before its great problems," Percy said.
We must get our heads up. As Margaret Thatcher said to us often, "Don't go wobbly," and, "Cheer up. America is a strong country."

10 places that can change your child's life
By Katia Hetter, CNN
updated 9:51 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2013
If your child spots a new dolphin on Dolphin Explorer Captain Chris Desmond's dolphin spotting trip outbound from Marco Island, Florida, the child gets to name the dolphin. The drive crossing through Big Sur requires a strong stomach, but the rewards are worth it. Visitors can stop at Sea Lion Point Trail, the Whalers Cabin Museum and the redwood trees at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. The Bixby Creek Bridge shown here is one of the world's highest single-span bridges (at 260 feet). Beneath the rim of the Grand Canyon is where children need to go to appreciate the many layers of historical and natural wonder. "The immensity of the canyon makes people think big," says botanist Mike Masek. "While this is rewarding, the true nature of the canyon comes alive upon closer inspection." Use the Chesapeake to teach children how a tadpole grows into a frog and where crabs live. "Crabs are magical and mysterious in their lives, not just in their place of rest on a plate," says former chef Barton Seaver, author of "For Cod and Country."
The star of "National Treasure: Book of Secrets," the Library of Congress likely has something about your child's interests. The world's largest library has 128 million items in 460 languages on 500 miles of shelves, adding new pieces at the rate of 10,000 items per day. New York City is here "because of the water," says actor John Keatts, author of "Tales of New York" and Circle Line tour guide. Taking the Circle Line boat tour around New York shows visitors the many ways people get everything onto the islands and one mainland county (the Bronx) that make up New York City.
For a first trip abroad for American children, London is a perfect stop: English-speaking (enough) to understand and foreign enough to be another country. Hints of the fictional Harry Potter are everywhere. The real star of the movie "Braveheart," Trim Castle was built over 30 years starting in the 1170s by Hugh de Lacy and his son, Walter. Children can help archaeologists excavate at nearby ruins of the Dominican Black Friary. Author Keith Bellows grew up in Muskoka, two hours north of Toronto. It's known as Ontario's "cottage country," where generations of visitors own or rent cottages and spend summer living simply amid the wilderness. No doubt the Galapagos is an expensive trip with or without children. But visitors to the protected islands can see how animals have evolved over time without any fear of humans. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Introduce your child to marine biology by searching for dolphins
Would-be geologists and anthropologists can be inspired by a Grand Canyon hike
Catch crabs and watch the wild horses run on the banks of the Chesapeake
Become an archaeologist for the day on a dig at a medieval Irish community (CNN) -- She's looking over the boat's edge to spot a dolphin and record its markings. He's digging for medieval tools in the fields around an abandoned friary. Or they're simply hearing their native language spoken a bit differently in a different country, where the food doesn't quite taste the same.
Travel can introduce kids to the world's real-life wonders, changing their perspective on topics they may have only read about in books.
It can literally change their lives.
"There is a kid's way of seeing the world," says Keith Bellows, editor-in-chief of National Geographic Traveler magazine and author of National Geographic's "100 Places That Can Change Your Child's Life." "As an adult, get out of the way, and stop marching them through an experience. When you get them to slow down and experience a place from their perspective, it's magic. Not just the place itself, but the experience."
Consider Bellows' suggestions a step up from simply taking a vacation. He says these places could open your child's eyes to the diversity of the world, help them learn what interests them and inform how they navigate it as adults.
Marco Island, Florida
Of course Walt Disney World is a Florida rite of passage for many children (and their parents) but there's so much to the state that isn't prefabricated. Marco Island is one of those places for Bellows, with beaches showing off the rusticity and charm of old Florida. Kids will love the beach and you can sneak in some science in the spectacular nature surrounding you.
To Disney or not to Disney?
Get on board the Dolphin Explorer with your children and turn them into citizen scientists. Capt. Chris Desmond, founder of the 10,000 Islands Dolphins Project, directs children to note the family compositions, behavior and even evidence of shark bites of the dolphins they spot. They give the data to adult biologists onboard who feed it into a computer. The bonus: If a child spots a new dolphin -- most are already known to the crew -- that child gets to name the dolphin. "Every kid wants to spot a newcomer and it happened on a trip I was on," says Bellows.
Big Sur, California
The drive from San Francisco into Big Sur may be Bellows' favorite drive in the world. "It is one of the most hair-raising drives in the world, and you get the sense of a wild, driving adventure," he says. "I've done it at least 40 or 50 times, and I never get tired of it."
He recommends renting a convertible and coming down from San Francisco through the agriculture fields onto the California coast, much of which is protected and can be explored along the way. One highlight: Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, just north of Big Sur. "It really teaches children that if you really love an area, you can protect it. Most of that coastline is protected, and it shows you what happens when you don't screw it up. "
Grand Canyon
Nothing makes Bellows feel more humble than standing on the lip of the Grand Canyon, even if he's standing with thousands of other people. "It's a bite out of the Earth, a thrilling glimpse into the inside of the Earth," he says.
Top U.S. spots for family fun
When children see the canyon layers below, that's the first step in their understanding of the geology of the Earth, says Bellows. Take an age-appropriate hike so your children can see the layers and wildlife that make up the canyon. "They can see we didn't just spring from nothing. This is a wafer sandwich of the world, and we're going to be one of the layers one day."
Chesapeake Bay, Maryland
The nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay is filled with 64,000 square miles of rivers, marshes and bays. "My kids have grown up there kneeling in grass, looking for tadpoles and pulling up crab pots ... and I love it," says Bellows. "It's some of the wildest primitive country we have. You can watch the ebb and flow of oysters, crabs and fishes, and it tells you how you're treating this incredible place."
It's the home of the wild ponies children have read about it in Marguerite Henry's "Misty of Chincoteague." Those ponies of Assateague Island National Seashore live in two herds. You can see the ponies at the park but don't feed them (to keep them wild).
Library of Congress, Washington
It's OK to tell your children that the movie "National Treasure: Book of Secrets" was filmed at the Library of Congress. (Heck, show them the movie in advance of your trip.) And yes, that it's the biggest library in the world with 3,800 staff, 500 miles of shelving and 128 million items (with about 10,000 items added each day).
7 tips for cherry blossom fun in D.C.
"If you go into the Library of Congress, you're going to tell them it's a library but it's also a treasure trove," says Bellows. Whatever your child likes, whether it's music or maps or sports or humor, it's likely he or she can find something about it here.
Your children also can get a "Passport to Knowledge" to guide them to the library's so-called greatest hits, and they can play at Knowledge Quest kiosks and bookmark places of interest to explore later on a personalized mini-site.
New York City
A visit to New York for every child who has not grown up there is also a rite of passage, says Bellows. "Every kid has to go to New York City, and every adult does, too," he says. "Every time you go back and haven't been there for awhile, it's a new place. It's so big and so fast."
Take the Circle Line boat tour, he suggests, so you can see by sailing around it how small an island Manhattan actually is. You can notice how connected it is to the other islands of Staten Island and Long Island (where Brooklyn and Queens are) and the Bronx, which is actually on the U.S mainland. "Here's an island in the middle of nowhere but it's connected to the entire world."
For children seeing the Statue of Liberty, a Broadway show or the city decorated at Christmas for the first time, "it gets imprinted on kids' minds."
London
London is a starter city for U.S. parents who want to take their kids out of the country, after you've explored the nearest metropolitan city and your national parks. "They speak English in London but a child will know just how foreign it is, with things like Marmite," says Bellows. "The wonderful thing about it is, this is a little like Harry Potter world. It's familiar enough to be safe and foreign enough to be thrilling."
Older children will love the ghoulish (and true) tales of the Tower of London. Begun in the 1070s by William the Conqueror, the tower was Europe's first fortress. Queen Anne Boleyn was beheaded there in 1536 and is rumored to still haunt the place.
Trim, Ireland
How could medieval warriors run in chain mail armor? How heavy is a stone ax, really? Head to the ruins of the Dominican Black Friary, a short distance from Trim Castle in the town of Trim, Ireland.
Once a home for religious men and women, the friary's ruins are being excavated in a special way. Visitors can get a crash course in excavation and start digging and recording their findings side-by-side with archaeologists and geologists. Younger children get to play at a camp, where they get to pick up heavy stone axes and run in chain mail.
Older children will enjoy a tour of nearby Trim Castle, which starred in the movie "Braveheart." Hugh de Lacy and his son Walter began construction of the castle, the largest Anglo-Norman castle in Ireland, in the 1170s. The castle protected the medieval village, once a commercial and religious powerhouse.
"What amazing architects these people were, and how remarkably old this is," says Bellows. "It's the quintessential castle. It's knights, bow and arrows and blood on the ground."
Muskoka, Canada
Bellows grew up in Muskoka, two hours north of Toronto in Ontario's cottage country. "This is where kids can really connect with wilderness, even more so than the Chesapeake," he says.
"There are dark lakes and loons at night. You can come out to a fish, flip the canoes and find the air holes underneath."
Almost anyone can rent a cabin in this area known for its more than 1,600 lakes and leave electronic entertainment behind, he says. "It is simple, simple living. You can take off your shoes for days" and simply run around barefoot.
Galapagos Islands
There's no doubt this trip is expensive. People who want to visit the Galapagos Islands have to take approved tours, designed to protect the islands' fragile ecology. This is where Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution, where nearby islands have different ecologies and animals who have adapted differently to their environments.
"There is no place like it in the world," says Bellows. "I've been twice, and the first time I went, I realized what Darwin was talking about. You see two birds who look the same but they have different vocalizations. It's like two people speaking English but one person is from Brooklyn and the other is from Boston."
The animals have no fear of humans, so your children will swim with dolphins and turtles and play near seals. But it's not all peaceful.
"I saw a seal attacked by a shark and dying, tortoises leaning into each other, both dead," he says. "You're on a beach and you see crabs hatch prematurely in the middle of the day, slowly breaking down. It's Darwin's theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest."
A tough, but essential, life lesson.

12 of the world's most spectacular Christmas trees
By Tamara Hinson, for CNN
updated 4:10 AM EST, Sat December 21, 2013
It's big, it's bright -- and it's not actually a tree but a 25-meter metal frame covered in fir tree branches. At least they're not plastic. But they probably are flammable.
Built with 400,000 Lego blocks. Hey, did kids make this thing?
Mariah Carey, Leona Lewis and the Goo Goo Dolls performed at the "turning on" of this 12-ton tree, donated by a Connecticut family who found a clever way of getting rid of it.
The world's largest "in-store" Christmas tree was designed by Swatch. Batteries not included. Good luck getting it home.
At 85 meters and 540 tons, it's the world's largest floating Christmas tree and possibly the world's only one of any note. Parabéns, Brazil! Must be hard to have an "austerity" Christmas with this baby parked out the front. And Obama gets to light it.
Norway has given Berlin a Christmas tree every year as a sign of peace and solidarity since the fall of the Berlin Wall. But no shockingly expensive Scandinavian thermal wear. Well, it's the thought that counts.
The hotel pastry team at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina, took 58 hours to create this 8,000-cakelet Christmas tree. And were paid in macaroons.
Made by a luxury umbrella maker Fulton and unsurprisingly festooned with said rain gear. Problems start when you imagine what other manufacturers might come up with.
This one reflects the baroque style shared by the host Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa and Bordeaux's opera house. Also sings in a nice soprano. We assume.
Fendi "bag bugs" festoon the fashion house's tree at the Hotel de Russie, Rome. Get up close and you'll hear it going "mwah mwah" and making snotty comments in five languages.
The 900 plastic bottles used to make this London tree were meant as a statement on Christmas consumerism. And a good one: 900 bottles sounds like a helluva lot. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Never mind the baubles -- one of these Christmas trees is made of macaroons Another, in Rome, is festooned with luxury handbags
Some go for glitz -- like the crystal-star-topped Rockefeller Center tree in NYC
Brazil's gaudiest floats on water
(CNN) -- Twinkly lights and tinsel?
That's so last Christmas.
Christmas trees don't have to be traditional to look spectacular.
In fact, some of the most memorable ones this year are anything but.
How about a Christmas tree made from Lego?
Or macaroons?
Even the odder entrants in this selection of the world's most amazing Christmas trees on public display tend to be big and bright.
And there are still plenty of sparkly stars to be found and photographed.
They're just much bigger and much brighter than the ones on the tree in your living room.
1. Vilnius Christmas tree (Lithuania)
The well-preserved old town in the Lithuanian capital looks like just the sort of place that needs a Christmas tree.
Now it's got one -- and it's 25 meters tall.
It's not so much a tree as a metal skeleton covered with fir tree branches.
Lithuanian fir tree branches, though -- they're not made in China.

Probably not made by kids.
2. Lego Christmas tree (Legoland Malaysia)
Asia's tallest Christmas tree is in Malaysia, but even more striking than its height is that it's made from Lego.
The nine-meter tree at Legoland Malaysia is made from 400,000 blocks of the child's toy.
More than 300 Lego baubles, including candles and slightly kinky multicolored chains, have been snapped on.
It's not a tree, either?
C'mon -- where's your Christmas spirit?
Legoland Malaysia, Bandar Medini Iskandar Malaysia, Nusajaya, Johor, Malaysia; +607 597 8888
3. Rockefeller Center Christmas tree (New York)
The unveiling of this 23-meter Norwegian spruce was a star-studded affair -- Mariah Carey, Leona Lewis and the Goo Goo Dolls performed.
Weighing 12 tons, the tree is decorated with 45,000 LEDS and topped with a 3-meter-wide Swarovski crystal star.
The tree was donated to the Rockefeller Center by the Vargoshe family, who planted it in the gardens of their Connecticut home 20 years ago.
And eventually wanted to get rid of it.
Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York; +1 212 588 8601
4. Galeries Lafayette Christmas tree (Paris)
At 20-meters tall, the world's highest in-store Christmas tree is an intricate, horology-themed affair standing in France's chicest department store, Galeries Lafayette.
Celebrating its 30th birthday this year, Swiss watchmaker Swatch helped design the tree, including the toy village at its base that springs to life on the hour.
Batteries not included.
And try getting the thing home.
Galeries Lafayette (French site only), 40 boulevard Haussmann, Paris; +33 09 69 39 75 75

World's largest -- or perhaps "only" -- floating Christmas tree.
5. Floating Christmas tree (Rio de Janeiro)
Rio advertizes its superlative seasonal contribution as "the world's largest floating Christmas tree."
Turns out it may be the world's only notable floating Christmas tree, save those dumped in various water supplies when the celebrations are over.
Nonetheless, its stats are pretty impressive.
More than 100,000 people turned out to see the 85-meter, 540-ton behemoth lit up for the first time in the waters off Rio.

6. National Christmas tree (Washington, D.C.)
Last year, the Obamas were criticized for decorating their home with an apparently excessive 54 Christmas trees.
This year, they have only 24.
Modest.
Barack Obama was tasked with switching on the 10-meter Colorado blue spruce known as the National Christmas Tree, which stands outside the White House gates in President's Park South.
The tree is a permanent fixture, looked after by the National Park Service -- which keeps that itchy foliage from getting everywhere when it comes time to trash most trees, post-Christmas.
National Christmas Tree, 17th and D Streets NW, Washington, D.C.; +1 202 354 6460

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Norway has given the German capital a Christmas tree every year as a sign of peace and solidarity with the reunified country.
The decorations on this year's tree, located as always beneath the Brandenburg Gate, are a bit of a contrast.
They're a freebie from Wintershall, Germany's largest crude oil and natural gas producer.
Nothing ironic there.

Hopefully, the staff have been fed well.
8. Macaroon Christmas tree, Ritz-Carlton (Charlotte, North Carolina)
The Christmas tree at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina, is edible: it's made from 8,000 colorful macaroons.
Using 10,008 egg whites, 110 cups of sugar and 57 cups of almonds, the hotel's pastry team took 58 hours to create -- or should that be bake -- the tree.
Ritz-Carlton Charlotte, 201 East Trade Street, Charlotte, North Carolina; +1 704 547 2244
9. Umbrella tree, Goring hotel (London)
Luxury umbrella brand Fulton made the tree outside London's Goring hotel, so it's not hard to guess which popular winter accessory features heavily.
Mirrored baubles designed to represent raindrops are interspersed with miniature umbrellas set with sequined crystals.
One of the brand's trademark birdcage-style umbrellas -- supposedly a favorite of the British royal family -- replaces the traditional star at the top of the tree.
Good thing Trojan doesn't make a Chrismas tree -- they don't right?
The Goring, Beeston Place, London; +44 7396 9000
10. Opera Christmas tree, Grand Hotel de Bordeaux & Spa (Bordeaux, France)
Decorated with elaborate opera costumes, yards of lace and hundreds of crystals, the Christmas tree at the Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa is the fruit of a collaboration with L'Opera National de Bordeaux.
The hotel and the opera house share a baroque style, as does the tree -- which sings in a nice soprano.
Not really.

One highly fashionable tree.
11. Fendi Christmas tree, Hotel de Russie (Rome)
A creation of the Italian fashion house Fendi, the Christmas tree at Rome's Hotel de Russie is unsurprisingly hung all over with the brand's plexiglass "bag bug" handbags.
The tree at nearby Palazzo Fendi (the fashion house's headquarters) has a similar theme, but with miniature Fendi baguette bags being used instead.
Can't help imagining that's one itchy tree.
Hotel de Russie in Rome, Via del Babuino 9, Rome; +39 06 328881
12. Recycled bottle Christmas tree (London)
Humble in origin but still impressive, the Christmas tree outside Ealing Town Hall in London was crafted from 900 plastic bottles collected by local school children.
Made by artist Ashley Phillips, the tree has a serious message: that more waste is produced over the festive season than at any other time of year.
Possibly including these bottles when everyone's done with the tree.
