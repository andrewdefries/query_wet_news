Rambling gunman dead after opening fire at Florida school meeting By Vivian Kuo and Phil Gast, CNN Gunman takes hostages at board meetingSTORY HIGHLIGHTSMan who fired at school board members apparently kills selfGunman had complained about fired relativeHe reportedly spray-painted a wall during incidentGet the local report from WJHG. (CNN) -- Clay Duke sat quietly through the first portion of the Bay District Schools, Florida, school board meeting Tuesday afternoon as local children were honored for their achievements. When it came time for citizens to bring up issues, the 56-year-old resident calmly approached the front. He spray painted a red "V" with a circle around it on the wall, brandished a small-caliber handgun and ordered the room cleared at a Panama City schools building. "Six men stay. Everyone else leave," the burly gunman said. Moments later, Ginger Littleton, a board member, returned to the room and swung a purse at him. She ended up on the ground after the two struggled. The gunman cursed her, but did not open fire and he let her leave the room. Someone was going to die, he said. Man opens fire at school board meeting

At that point, Duke, as seen on the dramatic live internet feed provided by CNN affiliates WJHG and WMBB, began a rambling discourse that included the apparent firing of his wife and sales taxes. The confrontation ended in the gunman identified as Duke calmly firing at the school officials, being wounded and, according to police, taking his own life. At first, school board members and Superintendent Bill Husfelt tried to reason with Duke, who had a criminal record. They talked about possibly finding a job for Duke's wife or looking into the case. Husfelt told the gunman that he likely signed the termination papers, but didn't recall the circumstances. "I'm the one who signed the papers," Husfelt. "Let them go," he said referring to the school board members. At one point, Husfelt said, "I don't want anybody to get hurt. I've got a feeling that what you want, is you want the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad. Because you said you are going to die." "But why? This isn't worth it," the superintendent told him. "This is a problem." The gunman then pointed the pistol at the official. "Please don't. Please don't. Please," Husfelt said. The gunman opened fire at Husfelt and school board members. He missed them all, even though he was at close range, said Lee Stafford, director of student services of Bay District Schools. Duke said, "I'm going to kill [unintelligible]," while he fired. Mike Jones, chief of security for the school system and a retired police officer, exchanged fire with Duke, who was wounded and rolled to the ground. Duke turned his gun on himself, dying of a fatal gunshot to the head, authorities said. Husfelt called Jones a "hero." The gunman was declared dead at a local hospital. An autopsy is expected Wednesday. Police and school officials were left to piece together what happened. "I'm sure they never expected this kind of event to occur," Sgt. Jeffrey Becker of the Panama City Police Department. The superintendent later related the event as being "surreal," Becker said. Husfelt told reporters that Duke had almost a smile on his face. "He made up his mind. You could tell he was going to die." The superintendent said he believes the gunman used a combination of live bullets and blanks. But police said live bullets were used. Husfelt told "AC360" Tuesday night that the gunman was "just mixed up" and that he tried to calm him down. "I knew the police were on their way." "You knew he had something in mind he was going to do and it would not end well," Husfelt said. The superintendent said he wanted to protect the school board members, but Duke did not want to talk. "The good Lord was standing in front of me," said the school chief, adding authorities found two bullet holes behind his desk. Police have a solid lead on Duke's motive, Becker said, but were not prepared Tuesday night to release it. The investigation includes Duke's assertions that his wife had been terminated by the school district. Police were talking with Duke's wife, Becker said. School officials said they were unaware of the significance of the spray painting. But a Facebook page belonging to a Clay Duke has a profile photo of a "V" in a red circle, a logo that is used in the movie "V for Vendetta." According to the Internet Movie Database, the 2006 film is about "a shadowy freedom fighter known only as "V" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally." CNN could not verify if the Facebook page belonged to the gunman, but it does list Duke, 56, as living in Panama City, Florida. A biography on Duke's Facebook page reads: "My Testament: Some people (the government sponsored media) will say I was evil, a monster (V)... no... I was just born poor in a country where the Wealthy manipulate, use, abuse, and economically enslave 95% of the population. Rich Republicans, Rich Democrats... same-same... rich... they take turns fleecing us... our few dollars... pyramiding the wealth for themselves. The 95%... the us, in US of A, are the neo slaves of the Global South. Our Masters, the Wealthy, do, as they like to us..." Under "political views," Duke labels himself a "Freedom Fighter." Under religious views, he wrote, "Humanism." Duke, who lived in Lynn Haven, a suburb of Panama City, has a previous record, Becker told CNN. According to the website of the Florida Department of Corrections, Duke was sentenced in 2000 for aggravated stalking, obstructing justice and throwing or shooting into a vehicle. According to the Panama City News Herald, after six months of stalking a former girlfriend, Duke confronted the woman outside her home on Oct. 20, 1999. He was wearing the mask and vest and holding two .22-caliber guns. He threatened to kill her, then kill several others and then himself, the newspaper said. When the woman tried to drive away, Duke shot out a rear tire. The photo of Duke on the corrections page matches the Facebook page. The News Herald reported that the gunman was taken out of the building on a stretcher. According to Panama City Police Chief John Van Etten, no one other than the suspect was injured, affiliate WJHG said. School board spokeswoman Karen Tucker said the man "was a large guy" she had seen sitting in the back of the boardroom earlier, according to the News Herald. Superintendent Husfelt will hold a press conference at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at the administration building in Panama City, police said. CNN affiliate WMBB reported children and parents were at the meeting to be recognized for achievements, but were gone before the incident began. "We are absolutely in state of shock," said Stafford. "I was in the third floor and we were watching the live feed, and first we thought it was a drill. But the more that you watched it, we realized this was an actual incident and emergency situation." Duke's Facebook page listed him as a 1972 graduate of King High School in Tampa. His favorite quotation: "You want the truth? You can't handle the truth," from the movie "A Few Good Men."From CNN's Vivian Kuo.

Facebook adds civil union, domestic partnership to relationship statuses By Jason Kessler, CNN | Filed under: Social Media Facebook is expanding its relationship status options to include civil unions and domestic partnerships. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook has added "In a civil union" and "In a domestic partnership" to its list"Facebook has set a new standard of inclusion," GLAAD saysSeveral gay-rights groups met with the company to push for the change, GLAAD says New York (CNN) -- Facebook users now have two more ways to describe their romantic arrangements. In a gesture of inclusiveness aimed at the gay community, Facebook on Thursday added "In a civil union" and "In a domestic partnership" to its official list of relationship statuses. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a gay rights group, which announced the change, cheered it. "By acknowledging the relationships of countless loving and committed same-sex couples in the U.S. and abroad, Facebook has set a new standard of inclusion for social media," Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation president Jarrett Barrios wrote in a statement. Barrios said that GLAAD and several other gay-rights groups met with the company to push for the change. The option is now available for Facebook users in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Australia, the group said.

What should I feed my dog?
By Morieka Johnson, MNN.com
updated 7:44 AM EST, Fri January 13, 2012
Read the label on your dog's food to make sure they're receiving a balanced diet. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Just like you would for your family, read the label on your dog's food Focus on health and nutrition factors, not hype
Consult an expert before changing your dog's diet (MNN.com) -- Dogs don't exactly have discriminating tastes. Many will even eat their own poop. What dogs do have working in their favor is a multibillion-dollar pet food industry vying for a place in their food bowls. The ever-growing list of options -- all natural, holistic, organic, human-grade -- can cause plenty of consternation among pet owners. Here are a few tips to help identify the best food option for your pets:
Read the label
Avoid falling for fancy descriptions that promise holistic or human-grade ingredients and focus instead on brands labeled "complete and balanced" by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This organization sets guidelines that help ensure pet food has been formulated to cover basic nutritional needs. You will find this label on many of the tried and true brands that have long occupied pet food shelves at your local grocery store.
"These are companies that have done the research -- hundreds of pages of studies -- proving the quality of their food," says Dr. Annie Price, owner of Ormewood Animal Hospital in Atlanta. "With a lot of over-the-counter, high-end food, there is no research to back what they claim as true. That's not to say it's not good food; we just have to be careful."
To help dog lovers navigate the food aisle, Dr. Jennifer Coates, a Colorado-based veterinarian and pet nutrition blogger with PetMD.com, worked with Hill's Science Diet pet food company to create an interactive nutrition guide called "MyBowl." Like the food pyramid, MyBowl breaks down the percentage of carbohydrates (50 percent), fats and oils (25 percent), and proteins (25 percent) dogs need as part of a complete and balanced diet.
MNN: The top animal stories of the year
"In the past you just grabbed whatever was on the shelf, and that's not the case anymore," Coates says. "Choice isn't always a good thing; it does make for more confusion."
When it comes to proteins, Coates tells clients to look for a predominance of food that sounds like what they would want to eat. Ingredients are listed based on quantity, so look for high-quality proteins to be listed among the first few items. Price adds that pet owners should buy food based on the appropriate life stage, particularly during those puppy years, and seek formulas specifically made for your breed.
"If you buy puppy food that has not been broken down into breed sizes, you can have problems," Price warns. "A German shepherd does not grow the same as a toy poodle. Large and giant breed dogs are prone to juvenile skeletal cartilage issues that we can prevent by having them on a proper diet."
The same rule applies to senior formulas. Pet food companies have upped their game by offering formulations with fewer calories and supplements such as fish oil to support joint health.

Avoid the hype
Even with a shaky economy, the pet food category continues to gain momentum. The American Pet Products Association reports that pet owners spent about $18.76 billion on food in 2010, up 6.8 percent from the previous year. Pet food expenses are expected to reach $19.53 billion this year as more pet owners connect the dots between health and nutrition. But pet nutritionist Dr. Martin Glinsky cautions pet owners to avoid the hype.
"We have got to be careful to distinguish between the marketing and nutrition end," says Glinsky, who consults companies seeking to formulate high-end pet food. He points to grain-free brands and limited-ingredient diets as the latest trends captivating pet owners. Restricting the number of proteins and grains, and introducing so-called novel proteins, such as buffalo or fish, help reduce the possibility of an allergic reaction. But not all pets need limited-ingredient diets, which often come with higher price tags than your average kibble.
"Documentation for all these allergies people profess their dogs have is totally out of whack," Glinsky says. "If everyone who told me their dog was allergic to corn is right, then we have an epidemic in this country. But people like to think that feeding a certain food is good for their dog and they are doing the best for them; that's human nature."
Rather than buy into limited-ingredient diets, Glinsky advises pet owners to focus on the manufacture date and toss kibble that is more than six months old. When pet food languishes for months on warehouse or grocery store shelves, natural ingredients break down and fat oxidizes, turning into harmful free radicals. For super-quick kibble, consider his line of Dr. G's Fresh Pet Food, which is made-to-order pet food and shipped about 48 hours after preparation. To promote oral health, Glinsky also recommends chews, but warns against rawhide.
"Pretty caustic materials [are used] to process the hide," he says. "Often this material is not rinsed completely."

Consult an expert before changing food
The farm-to-table movement has piqued curiosity about the origins of beef or chicken meal listed on pet food labels. Recent recalls also have fueled an interest in raw diets for cats and dogs. While slightly more expensive than dry food, proponents note that raw diets, which are free of chemical preservatives, promote healthier coats and more closely resemble a pet's diet in the wild. Because raw diets involve uncooked meat, safe handling practices are vital to avoid the threat of salmonella. Before you try a raw diet, dabble with home-cooked meals, or simply change your pet's kibble, it's important to consult an expert. Veterinarians or veterinary nutritionists can walk you through the steps to make a healthy transition for your pet.
"A lot of people think we get kickbacks for these foods, but we don't get wined and dined," Price says. "I don't get anything for free, trust me. I just see the research that companies have done over the last 20 years."
Based on pet nutrition research, Price vehemently opposes raw diets, which can expose humans to potential health risks such as salmonella. She also says that raw diets lack the presence of trace minerals that pets need, introducing the risk for disease. If you have the time and the money, she does recommend home-cooked meals, if done with input from veterinary nutritionists.
"They can help you come up with an actual recipe for the meal based on the dog's weight and caloric need," she says. "You don't just get a doggie cookbook because they are not nutritionally sound, either. You can publish anything you want and it doesn't even have to be peer-reviewed."

What about cats?
Whenever I chat with Price, she always offers information about our feline friends, and this time was no exception. For years, veterinarians have recommended dry kibble as a way to promote good oral health. Price points to new research that indicates wet food may be beneficial, particularly for cats.
"We realized a lot of animals don't even chew their food, so it doesn't really matter if it's canned or dry," she says. "Cats love to keep themselves a little on side of dehydration and the latest recommendation for cats' urinary health -- and to prevent diabetes and weight gain -- is to increase fluid intake."
Access to water helps, but Price says that a high-quality canned food can be beneficial to cat health, particularly if they are prone to urinary tract issues or kidney disease.
Hopefully this information will help ensure that your cats and dogs are happy and healthy for years to come.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen: Member of SEAL Team 6 disputes Esquire account of bin Laden raid
He says there are doubts about the story the "shooter" told to Esquire
Bergen: Killing was team effort, may not have been connected to bin Laden gun in the room
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad" and a director at the New America Foundation.
The following is a CNN exclusive.
(CNN) -- In February, Esquire magazine published a lengthy profile of "The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden." The story did not identify the killer by his real name, referring to him only as "the Shooter." The Shooter told Esquire he encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he'd been hiding for more than five years.
The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun "within reach" and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. That account was in conflict with the narrative from another raid participant in a wildly successful book, "No Easy Day."
Peter Bergen Now, another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, tells CNN the story of the Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is "complete B-S."

SEAL Team 6 operators are now in "serious lockdown" when it comes to "talking to anybody" about the bin Laden raid and say they have been frustrated to see what they consider to be the inaccurate story in Esquire receive considerable play without a response. Phil Bronstein, who wrote the 15,000-word piece about the Shooter for Esquire, was booked on CNN, Fox and many other TV networks after his story came out.
Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards, and wounded two other women.
SEALs' accounts differ
Who really killed bin Laden?
Reported bin Laden killer speaks out
2011: 3 of bin Laden's wives identified
The first three SEALs to make it to the top floor of the compound were "the point man," "the Shooter" profiled by Esquire, and Matt Bissonette, the SEAL who wrote "No Easy Day" under the pseudonym Mark Owen.
What actually happened the night of the raid, according to the SEAL Team 6 operator who I interviewed, is that the "point man" ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot bin Laden in the head when he saw what looked like bin Laden poking his head out of his bedroom door. The shot gravely wounded al Qaeda's leader.
Having taken down bin Laden, the point man proceeded to rush two women he found in the bedroom, gathering them in his arms to absorb the explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests, something that was a real concern of those who planned the raid.
'Nightmare' at home for SEAL who shot Osama bin Laden
Two more SEALs then entered bin Laden's bedroom and, seeing that the al Qaeda leader was lying mortally wounded on the floor, finished him off with shots to the chest.
This account of bin Laden's demise is considerably less heroic than the Shooter's version in Esquire, in which he says he shot bin Laden while he was standing up and only after he saw that the al Qaeda leader had a gun within reach.
The SEAL Team 6 operator who spoke to me says there is no way the Shooter could have seen a gun in bin Laden's reach because the two guns that were found in the bedroom after the shooting were only discovered after a thorough search and were sitting on a high shelf above the frame of the door that opened to the room.
SEAL commander rebuts 'Shooter' claim
The SEAL operator also points out there was a discussion before the raid in which the assault team was told "don't shoot the guy (bin Laden) in the face unless you have to" because the CIA would need to analyze good pictures of bin Laden's face for its facial recognition experts to work effectively. Yet the Shooter in the Esquire story says he shot bin Laden on purpose twice in the forehead.
A U.S. official familiar with the details of the raid said the SEAL Team 6 operator's version is in line with what happened. That account "has it right in my view," the official said.

The SEAL Team 6 operator also tells CNN that the Shooter was "thrown off" the Red Squadron, the core of the SEAL Team 6 group that carried out the bin Laden raid, because he was bragging about his role in the raid in bars around Virginia Beach, Virginia, where SEAL Team 6 is based. In the Esquire article, the Shooter complains he is receiving no pension, since he left the military four years before the minimum 20 years required to be eligible.
CNN spoke with Bronstein, the Esquire writer, who says he passed on CNN's written questions about the Shooter's role in the raid to his story's main character. The Shooter has not responded to those questions, and Bronstein declined to be interviewed on-the-record for this story.
Stephanie Tuck, a spokeswoman for Esquire, said via e-mail the magazine stands by its story.
"The Esquire article, 'The Shooter: The Man Who Killed Osama Bin Laden,' in the March 2013 issue, is based on information from numerous sources, including members of SEAL Team 6 and the Shooter himself, as well as detailed descriptions of mission debriefs."
More questions were raised about the Esquire story's version of events Monday on SOFREP, a website that covers the Special Operations community. The queries came from former Navy SEAL Brandon Webb in a posting entitled, "Esquire Is Screwed: Duped By Fake UBL 'Shooter.'"
2011: SEALs who killed bin Laden concerned for their safety
According to present and former members of SEAL Team 6, the "point man" who fired the shot that likely mortally wounded bin Laden will never "in a million years" speak publicly about his role in the raid, and they lauded his courageous decision to throw himself on the two women in bin Laden's room.
The new account of the bin Laden raid provided by the serving SEAL Team 6 operator is essentially the same as in Bissonnette's "No Easy Day." Bissonnette says he was one of the first to run into the bedroom and he saw that the point man's shots had mortally wounded bin Laden. Bissonette says he then shot the dying al Qaeda leader as he lay on the floor.
Present and former members of SEAL Team 6 say they regard Bissonnette as more credible than the Shooter.
Balanced against that, according to a story filed by CNN's Barbara Starr last year, after the publication of "No Easy Day," the head of U.S. special operations, Adm. William McRaven, contacted members of the Navy SEAL team that killed bin Laden. According to Pentagon officials, the SEALs said bin Laden was standing in his bedroom when he was shot and they believed that he posed a threat because there were weapons in the room. This account tends to bolster the story the Shooter told Esquire.
In a previous CNN.com story about the Esquire profile, I noted that I was the only outside observer allowed to tour bin Laden's Abbottabad compound before it was demolished in late February 2012.
During that tour, I looked around the bedroom where bin Laden was killed. The Pakistani military officers who were guiding me pointed out a patch of dark, dried blood on the low ceiling of bin Laden's bedroom. This patch of congealed blood seems to be consistent with the Shooter's story that he fired two shots at the forehead of a "surprisingly tall terrorist" while he was standing up. At the time, the precise location of bin Laden when he was shot was not a matter of dispute.
But the blood patch could also be consistent with the account that it was the "point man" who first shot bin Laden. The point man is 5 feet 6 inches tall and was shooting upward at a tall man as he poked his head out of his bedroom.
2011: Obama meets bin Laden raiders, promises victory over al Qaeda
The compound is, of course, now gone, so it is no longer possible to reconstruct what happened the night of the raid based on forensic evidence, although it is possible the Abbottabad Commission, a panel that was appointed by the Pakistani government to look into the raid, could shed some light on this question should its findings ever be publicly released.
Finally, by all accounts, it was a confusing situation the night of the raid. One of the SEAL team's helicopters had crashed and there was a firefight with one of bin Laden's bodyguards. All the electricity in the compound and the surrounding neighborhood was off on a moonless night and the SEALs were all wearing night vision goggles, which only allowed them limited vision.
What seems incontrovertible is that the point man, the Shooter and Bissonnette were the first three SEALs to assault bin Laden's bedroom. But to determine exactly which of them killed the al Qaeda leader may never be possible.
What is certain is that it was a team effort.
Five days after the bin Laden raid, members of the SEAL team who carried out the mission briefed President Barack Obama. According to those in the room, the SEAL team commander explained to the president, "If you took one person out of the puzzle, we wouldn't have the competence to do the job we did; everybody's vital. It's not about the guy who pulled the trigger to kill bin Laden, it's about what we all did together."

Obama at Navy Yard memorial: 'We can't accept this'
By Dan Merica, CNN
updated 10:10 AM EDT, Mon September 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Obama says U.S. "can't accept" killing of 12 at D.C.'s Navy Yard as "inevitable"
"It ought to be a shock to all of us, as a nation and as a people," Obama says
Obama honors each victim, noting some of the last things they said before they died
"Our tears are not enough," Obama tells families of those killed
Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Sunday that the United States "can't accept" last week's killing of 12 people at Washington's Navy Yard as "inevitable," but the shooting should instead "lead to some sort of transformation" on gun violence in the United States.
"It ought to be a shock to all of us, as a nation and as a people," Obama said at the Marine Barracks, just a few short blocks from the Navy Yard. "It ought to obsess us. It ought to lead to some sort of transformation."
The president said during his speech that grieving with the families impacted by mass shootings is something he has had to do five times in his presidency, citing shootings in Fort Hood, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; Newtown, Connecticut; and now the Washington Navy Yard.
"Part of what wears on as well is the sense that this has happened before," Obama said. "What wears on us, what troubles us so deeply as we gather here today, is how this senseless violence that took place in the Navy Yard, echoes other recent tragedies."
Twelve people were killed in a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on September 16. Here are photos of some of the victims: Vishnu Bhalchandra Pandit, 61, of North Potomac, Maryland.
Mary Francis Knight, 51, of Reston, Virginia.
Kathy Gaarde, 62, of Woodbridge, Virginia.
Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46, of Waldorf, Maryland.
Martin Bodrog, 54, of Annandale, Virginia.
John Roger Johnson, 73, of Derwood, Maryland.
Michael Arnold, 59, of Lorton, Virginia.
Frank Kohler, 50, of Tall Timbers, Maryland.
Richard Michael Ridgell, 52, of Westminster, Maryland.
Arthur Daniels, 51, of Southeast Washington.
Sylvia Frasier, 53, of Waldorf, Maryland.

Photos: Navy Yard shooting victims
Remembering the Navy Yard victims 'She was not a victim'
Hear dramatic Navy Yard rescue attempt
Unraveling the Navy Yard killer's past
The president continued: "Sometimes I fear there is a creeping resignation ... that this is somehow the new normal. We can't accept this."
Twelve people were killed and eight were wounded when Aaron Alexis, a Navy contractor, entered the sizable naval instillation in Washington and opened fire in Building 197. The victims, whose ages ranged from 46 to 73, all worked at the Navy Yard and many were gunned down as Alexis shot at them from above in the Navy building.
The issue of gun violence has dominated much of Obama's second term in office, with a concerted effort to strengthen gun laws coming after 26 people -- including 20 children -- were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012.
'There's a guy slaughtering people with a shotgun'
The push, however, eventually failed, with the lawmakers on Capitol Hill failing to pass any laws tightening gun restrictions. Groups including the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America vociferously protested the proposed changes.
In response to last week's shooting at Navy Yard, most gun-control advocates were resigned to the fact that not much in the of legislative changes would be made in response.
"We don't have the votes," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a supporter of gun control, on Tuesday. "I'd like to get them but we don't have them now."
The NRA, in response to the shooting, on Sunday suggested more armed guards at military installations.
Obama attempted to take what he saw as acceptance of gun violence head on, worrying that mass shootings could not become the "new normal."
"I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis," Obama said, pointing to the fact that other countries, like Great Britain and Australia, lowered gun violence by restricting access to guns after mass shootings rocked their country.
Throughout much of the speech, the president acknowledged a hesitance in Washington to fight over gun laws and, instead, said change would need to come because of the American people's desire for it.
Who were the victims?
"It may not happen tomorrow, it may not happen next week, it may not happen next month, but it will happen, because it's the change that we need," the president said.
Obama also used the speech to give a glimpse into the life of each of the 12 victims, mentioning everything from Arthur Daniels' love of polishing his white Crown Victoria to John Johnson's last words to his wife: "Good-bye, beautiful. I love you so much."
"Our tears are not enough," he said to the families. "Our words and our prayers are not enough. If we really want to honor these 12 men and women, if we really want to be country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun, then we're going to have to change. We're going to have to change."
Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray joined Obama on Sunday in calling for tighter gun laws in response to the shooting, telling the audience that "our country is drowning in a sea of guns."
In taking the stage, Obama was stepping into a role he has become very familiar with, counselor-in-chief, and Sunday's remarks were reminiscent, in some ways, of past speeches he has given at memorial services for mass shootings.
Reframing the gun control debate: Is mental health the next focus?
Obama, however, is not the first president to play the role of counselor-in-chief.
Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were praised for the leadership they showed in the aftermath of two domestic disasters -- the space shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
Representatives from the military, including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Vice Adm. William Hilarides, commander of Naval Sea Systems Command, also spoke at Sunday's event. All honored the fallen by noting that they died in the line of duty, just like those killed in battle.
"These 12 members of our Navy team, our Navy family, were killed in the line of duty, they died in the service to our nation, the service to our Navy, service they were just as committed to as anyone in uniform," an emotional Hilarides said. "For that service, we honor them. For that service, we will never forget them."

One accomplice surrendered to police, but others were killed alongside the suspected mastermind, the news agency said.
The attacks on Volgograd's public transit system in late December, which killed 34 people and injured about 100, shocked Russia and fueled security concerns ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics.
