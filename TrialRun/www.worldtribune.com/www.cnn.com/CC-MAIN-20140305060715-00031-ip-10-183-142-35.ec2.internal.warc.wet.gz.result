CNN Student News One-Sheet: DebatesStory Highlights Use this One-Sheet to help your students understand debates During debates, candidates answer questions about the issues of the day In 2008, there will be three presidential debatesNext Article in Living » Read VIDEO QUIZ (CNN Student News) -- Historical Background: Presidential debates are a product of the television era. In 1960, Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy met in the first general election presidential debate, which was viewed by about 70 million people. One goal of a debate, both then and now, is to look presidential. Though there were differences between Kennedy and Nixon on the issues, some historians say that Kennedy's appearance and demeanor during this debate led to his victory over Nixon.

The Commission on Presidential Debates
Debates disappeared from the general election scene for 16 years, as President Lyndon Johnson refused to debate in 1964, and Nixon avoided facing his opponents in 1968 and 1972. In 1976, incumbent President Gerald Ford challenged Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter to a debate, heralding a new era of presidential debates. The League of Women Voters managed the face-to-face contests from 1976 until 1984. In 1987, the Democratic and Republican parties established the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates to sponsor and produce the general election presidential debates. Some have argued the commission unfairly favors the current two-party system. The commission requires a third-party participant to be polling at 15 percent in order to participate in a presidential debate. Debates traditionally feature two candidates fielding questions from the moderator and generating rebuttals. For one debate in 1992, candidates answered questions from the audience in the first town hall forum. That year, the commission hosted the first three-way political debates when Ross Perot appeared with President George H. W. Bush and then-Governor Bill Clinton. In 1996, the commission barred Perot from appearing, stating that he did not have "a 'realistic' chance to win election." In 2004, the candidates for vice president, Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. John Edwards, debated while seated at a table with the moderator. During debates, candidates are asked questions on the issues of the day. This year, expect questions about the Iraq war, energy policy, taxes, immigration and the economy. Voters will see all of this unfold live on television, and the media and political experts will provide analysis afterward. While the campaigns may declare victory after a debate, the result at the ballot box determines the real winner. 2008 debates: There will be three presidential debates in 2008 and one vice presidential debate, all sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission, in collaboration with the two major political parties, chooses the dates, location, formats and moderators for each event. First presidential debate When: Friday, September 26, 9 p.m. ET Where: University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi The candidates will sit with moderator Jim Lehrer at a table. Lehrer will introduce foreign policy issues on which each candidate will comment, and there may be direct exchanges between the candidates. Vice presidential debate When: Thursday, October 2, 9 p.m. ET Where: Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri Gwen Ifill will moderate a debate between the vice presidential candidates covering foreign and domestic topics, using a similar format to the first presidential debate. Second presidential debate When: Tuesday, October 7, 9 p.m. ET Where: Belmont University, Nashville, Tennessee This debate will be a town hall meeting, where moderator Tom Brokaw will supply the candidates with questions provided by undecided voters from the Nashville area as well as ones submitted via Internet. Third presidential debate When: Wednesday, October 15, 9 p.m. ET Where: Hofstra University, Hempstead, New York Bob Schieffer will sit down with the candidates as moderator in a domestic policy debate similar in format to the first presidential debate. The candidates will deliver closing statements at the end of this final presidential debate. Sources: The Commission on Presidential Debates, CNN Library, http://www.debatethis.org

No kids, no jobs for growing number of wivesStory Highlights Author: Stay-at-home wives constitute a growing niche Some couples say the arrangement makes life less stressful for both parties The biggest draw is focusing on making home a better place, expert says Next Article in Living » By Sarah Jio	(LifeWire) -- "What do you do all day?" is a question Anne Marie Davis, 34, says she gets a lot. Stay-at-home wives represent a growing niche, according to the author of "The Secrets of Happily Married Women." Davis, who lives in Lewisville, Texas, isn't a mother, nor does she telecommute. She is a stay-at-home wife, which makes her something of a pioneer in the post-feminist world. Ten years ago, she was an "overwhelmed" high school English teacher. "I didn't have time for my husband, " she says, "and I didn't have a life." She presented the idea of staying home to her husband, a Web engineer. "I told him it was something I wanted to do, and he supported it. It was a great relief." Dr. Scott Haltzman, author of "The Secrets of Happily Married Women," says stay-at-home wives constitute a growing niche. "In the past few years, many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home," he says. While his research is ongoing, he estimates that more than 10 percent of the 650 women he's interviewed who choose to stay home are childless. Daniel Buccino, a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine clinical social worker and psychotherapist, says stay-at-home wives are the latest "status symbols." "It says, 'We make enough money that we both don't need to work outside the home,'" he says. "And especially with the recent economic pressures, a stay-at-home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury." Don't Miss Honey, I cheated with your checkbook
How to grab more time for you
In Depth: Having It All
June Cleaver, minus Beaver and Wally Davis says her life isn't luxurious. "Tuesdays are my laundry day," she says. "I go grocery shopping on Wednesdays and clean house on Thursdays." Mondays and Fridays are reserved for appointments and other errands. But her schedule also allows for charity work and leisure: reading, creative writing and exploring new hobbies, like sewing. It's a lifestyle, Davis says, that has made her happier and brought her closer to her husband. "We're no longer stressed out," she says; because she takes care of the home, there are virtually no "honey-do" lists to hand over. Stay-at-home guilt "If you told me years ago that I was going to be a stay-at-home wife, I would have laughed at you," says Catherine Zoerb, 27. Yet after the Wichita, Kansas, resident finished graduate school in 2005, she found herself unemployed, childless -- and strangely happy. With her husband's support, Zoerb decided to just stay home. "I was able to clip coupons, do all the chores and make nice dinners," she says. "I was much less stressed and tense." But she was concerned, too -- about not using her master's degree in English and how future employers would view her work history. "I worried about gaps in my resume," she says. And there was something else: "I thought about the feminist movement -- all those women who worked so hard so that I could go out and have a good career, and I was kind of saying 'no thanks.'" Recently, Zoerb took a temporary job at an engineering firm. It will boost her resume, and although the Zoerbs don't need the money, it will help pay down their mortgage. Still, she hopes to return to stay-at-home wifedom soon. "I'd never say that a woman shouldn't work," she says. "But I don't see what good it would do to work in a job that I couldn't stand, and if I have the choice not to, why wouldn't I take that opportunity?" Retro marriage, 21st century-style "Everyone seems to be OK with women staying home when they have kids," says Davis, who currently doesn't plan to have children. "I've actually heard people say that women who don't work are a drain on society." Don't be too quick to judge, says Haltzman. Women might give up a job to focus on an advanced degree, pursue artistic or creative goals, or deal with health issues. Surprisingly, though, Haltzman says the biggest draw is homemaking itself. "Many women I talk to take care of the household seriously, and they want to focus on caring for the home, whether or not it involves children." Sometimes a wife's desires don't align with her husband's. "I hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work," Haltzman says, "but only if there are financial stresses. One of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household." Kirk Zoerb is an exception: The 27-year-old engineer says he's happiest when his wife is jobless. "When Catherine stays at home, I feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in-depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden," he says. "She also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores, garage sales and at grocery stores." As a couple, he says, "we have more energy and are generally emotionally healthier." Still, "I don't believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook, cleaner or shopper, and I don't believe the man must be the breadwinner. I wouldn't mind staying at home while Catherine works!"

CNN Poll: 54 percent approve of Obama President Obama's approval rating of 54 percent is nearly identical to the 53 percent of the vote he won a year ago. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The percent that approve of Obama is within 2-3 points of the percent who voted for him Among conservatives, the number who like Obama today is down 10 points A bare majority -- 51 percent -- approve of how Obama is handling foreign policy overall RELATED TOPICS
Barack Obama
George W. Bush
Dick Cheney
Washington (CNN) -- One year after he won a historical presidential election, a slight majority of Americans approve of the job Barack Obama's doing in the White House. Fifty-four percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Tuesday approve of how Obama is handling his duties as president, with 45 percent saying they disapprove. "Obama's approval rating of 54 percent is nearly identical to the 53 percent of the vote he won a year ago," notes CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "And in nearly every demographic category, the percent that approve of Obama today is within two to three points of the percent who voted for him in 2008. It's a different story when we turn to ideology. His approval rating among liberals is 7 points higher than the number of liberals who voted for him. But among conservatives, the number who like Obama today is down 10 points compared to his share of the vote among that group in 2008." The survey suggests that the president's approval rating remains over 50 percent even though most Americans disapprove of how Obama is handling the economy, health care, Afghanistan, Iraq, unemployment, illegal immigration and the federal budget deficit. How does he do it? "By retaining a reservoir of goodwill left over from his election to the White House a year ago. Six in 10 say Obama inspires confidence in them; six in 10 also call him a strong leader who is honest and trustworthy. Sixty-three percent say he is not a typical politician. More than half give Obama a thumbs-up on 11 of the 12 personal characteristics tested," adds Holland. Only 45 percent say he has a clear plan for solving the country's problems -- the only item on which a majority has a negative view of him. It's a different story when it comes to issues. More than half have a positive view on Obama on only three of the 14 issues noted in the survey. Obama does get a 62 percent approval rating on the environment and -- despite recent vaccine shortages - 57 percent approve of how he has handled the government response to the H1N1 flu. But a bare majority -- 51 percent -- approve of how Obama is handling foreign policy overall even though he gets some of his lowest scores on Iraq and Afghanistan. Three days after winning the election, then president-elect Obama said he would succeed "if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together as one nation. That's what I intend to do." Do Americans think the president will unite the country? The poll indicates Americans are divided, with 51 percent saying Obama will unite the country and 48 percent feeling he will not succeed in ending partisanship. Another factor that may be boosting Obama's overall rating is the inevitable comparison with the man he replaced in the Oval Office. Fifty-seven percent say Obama has been a better president than George W. Bush; only a third say Bush's track record was better. "Compared to Obama, Bush does fairly well among southerners and rural voters. But even in those categories, a majority still says Obama has done a better job than Bush," says Holland. The survey also suggests that by 24 points, Americans think that Joe Biden is a better vice president than Dick Cheney. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted October 30 through November 1, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

The storyA jury in Austria has found Josef Fritzl guilty of raping and imprisoning his daughter for more than two decades and sentenced him to life in prison.It was the maximum sentence for the most serious charge Fritzl faced: one count of murder, for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth. The eight-member jury returned a unanimous verdict on all counts. Fritzl, dressed in a gray suit, blue shirt and dark tie, stared blankly ahead and showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict.

'Food stamp president': Gingrich's poetry of hate
By Walter Mosley, Special to CNN
updated 11:22 AM EST, Thu January 26, 2012
GOP candidate Newt Gingrich appears at a campaign event on January 25 in Cocoa, Florida.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Walter Mosley: Gingrich called Obama the "food stamp president," knowing its impact
A political poet like Gingrich, he says, chooses each word for its punch and meaning
Mosley: In 3 words, he's sown fear in working people, evoked racism, stigmatized poverty
Mosley says we can't allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of hate
Editor's note: Walter Mosley is the author of more than 34 books, including the mystery series featuring Easy Rawlins and his latest featuring Leonid McGill. He has won an O. Henry Award, a Grammy and PEN America's Lifetime Achievement Award. His newest book is "All I Did Was Shoot My Man" (Riverhead Books). (CNN) -- Newt Gingrich is a political opportunist. His job is to pack as much powerfully charged meaning into every sentence as he can, which makes him a working poet. So he knows full well that calling someone a "food stamp president" brings up the working person's fear, looming reality, and in some cases the actual experience, of unemployment -- while making a shout-out to racism and affixing a stigma to poverty. All the while hiding behind the symbol of a flag.
It is the bane of America and Americans that too often, those who best grasp the language of hatred and fear are those who are most likely to lead. This is simply because tacticians like Gingrich are well-versed in the traditional battle-cry and have no fear of the outcome of political civil war. Why should they be afraid ? They will never be down in the streets suffering with the people.
Gingrich says his words were misinterpreted, that anybody who criticizes his characterization of President Obama is attacking the very fiber of American democracy. He sounds like a lawyer explaining away a crime by influencing the point of view of the jury with doubletalk. "It is not that my client isn't guilty but that you cannot prove that he is."
Woe be it to America when our lawyers become our poets.
Walter Mosley
It is the job of the lawyer, poet and politician to stir the emotions of their audience. But where literary poets speak of love and loss, the lawyer vindicates and the politician aims to take the reins of power. Characters are assassinated and whole groups of people are vilified in order that new blood ascend the throne.
What is most revealing about Gingrich's statement is the nature of the comment, rather than who said it or even what it means. We see, at the beginning of the race for president, that our contestants for the greatest power in the world are limited in their choice of tactics, that they must destroy their opponents and, later, those that stood against their campaign.
How do I know this is true? Because Mr. Gingrich is a political poet and good political poets always have their finger on the jugular vein of the nation. Mr. Gingrich has told me in three words that the battle line will be drawn by fear-stoked hatred.
Hatred and fear have deep roots in the American heart. The original colonists came here to escape religious, cultural and political oppression. Sadly, these idealistic refugees brought those social banes along with them.
There was once a time when only white male property owners participated in the democratic process of America. There was a time when we slaughtered the original inhabitants of these shores. But it was not the landed gentry that made up the rank and file. Our senators and congresspersons, our millionaires and gentlemen farmers did not have to bleed for the crimes we've committed and the freedoms we've attained. All our leaders had to do was to locate our fear and greed and hatred. These feelings were exhorted in speech and song and catchy phrases. Once this was accomplished we, the people, standing on sodden streets and dressed in rough cloth, marched off to die for another man's dream.
That was then and this is now. We -- Americans of every stripe, gender and race -- are brothers and sisters in that great and ever-changing experiment of democracy. We are not enemies. If someone has a better plan he or she should ascend to our presidency. If they have lied we should know it. If they are corrupt it must come out. But we cannot allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of fear and hatred. This election is about us working together to implement our brightest potentials, not our basest natures.

Timeline of Tibetan protests in China
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 1:08 AM EST, Tue January 31, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Tensions has periodically swelled in ethnic Tibetan regions of China since March 2008
Rights Group: Since March 2011, 16 people have set themselves on fire in protest
(CNN) -- The escalation of tensions in ethnically Tibetan regions of China is the latest in a series that have resulted in deaths, frayed ties between the United States and China, and greater pressure from Beijing against the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet for India in 1959 after a failed uprising.
March 2008 -- Hundreds of Tibetan monks gather in Lhasa in protests to mark the 49th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Beijing rule. Protesters sought the release of fellow Drepung monks, who apparently were detained, as they tried to celebrate the awarding of the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama months earlier, according to foreign Tibetan rights groups. As the week wore on, protests and violence escalated. Rights groups said more than 140 people died, while Chinese authorities put the figure at 22 dead.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama for the violence in Tibet and said Chinese forces exercised restraint in confronting unrest there.
April 2008 -- The global Olympic torch rally for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics begins but becomes a flashpoint for protests one month after the unrest in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Thousands protested on the streets of San Francisco, and the unruly scene of the London leg of the torch run was labeled "a public relations nightmare" by the Times. "We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France," a China spokeswoman said at the time. Meanwhile in Tibet, 30 people were convicted of arson, robbery and attacking government offices related to the March violence and receive prison sentences ranging from three years to life.
November 2008 -- China sentences 55 people for involvement in anti-China protests, out of the 1,300 originally detained, according to state media, although the charges and sentences they received weren't revealed.

December 2008 -- Chinese authorities arrest 59 people in Tibet accused of spreading rumors and inciting sentiment against the state and public safety, state-run media reported.
January 2009 -- Lawmakers in Tibet approve March 28 as a holiday to mark the date that China says about one million people were freed in 1959 from serfdom in the Himalayan region, state-run media reported. The legislation was aimed at "reminding all the Chinese people, including Tibetans, of the landmark democratic reform initiated 50 years ago," a parliament spokesperson said.
March 2009 -- Near the one-year anniversary of the riots and 50th anniversary of the failed Tibetan uprising, a monk carrying a Tibetan national flag and shouting slogans set himself on fire in Sichuan Province and then was shot at by police, a human rights group reported. Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, reported a local official as saying that the man had been taken to a local hospital immediately after police extinguished the flames. Foreign tourists are banned from visiting Tibet during the month.
February 2010 -- China summons U.S. ambassador to express its "strong dissatisfaction of a meeting between the Dalai Lama and U.S. President Barack Obama.
March 2010 -- Beijing appoints the 11th Panchen Lama -- handpicked by the Chinese government as the second highest Tibetan spiritual figure -- to the Chinese People's Consultative Conference. Beijing's critics, however, say that the inclusion of the Panchen Lama at the annual meeting is part of a stepped up effort to undermine the popularity of Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama.
October 2010 --Tibetan students take to the streets in protest, claiming their culture is being wiped out, as China overhauls school curriculum and limits the use of the Tibetan language in schools. "The protest resulted from a new education policy which reduces Tibetan language teachings," a government official told CNN at the time. The government said 800 students protested, while the activist group Free Tibet said 4,000 to 6,000 students protested.
March 2011 -- The Dalai Lama, at a speech marking the 52nd anniversary of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule which caused him to flee into India, announces he will retire political responsibilities as head of Tibet's government-in-exile but will remain its spiritual head. Lobsang Sangay is elected by Tibetan exiles to take over day-to-day political responsibilities.
On March 16, a monk named Phuntsog set himself on fire to protest the third anniversary of the 2008 protests, according to Free Tibet.
August 2011 -- A 29-year-old monk, Tsewang Norbu, sets himself ablaze after chanting slogans, according to Free Tibet. The self immolations continue, and by October a nun -- the first woman -- is reported to have killed herself, the ninth Tibetan to commit self- immolation in protest.
January 2012 -- Three more monks set themselves ablaze in protest, bringing the number who have self-immolated in protest to 16 since March 2011, Free Tibet claims. Twelve are thought to have died from their injuries.
Thousands of Chinese security forces have flooded into an ethnically Tibetan area of southwestern China following large protests in the wake of the self-immolations.

'Casablanca' piano will be played again
By Joe Sterling and Gabriel Falcon, CNN
updated 8:29 AM EST, Mon December 17, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The piano was used in a famous scene from the 1942 film "Casablanca"
It was auctioned off to a private collector
The sale was greeted by applause at Sotheby's
(CNN) -- For one private collector, it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
A buyer has purchased the piano used in one of the most beloved scenes in all of film: the playing of "As Time Goes By" in "Casablanca" -- the 1942 classic movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
Sotheby's New York auctioned the piano for $602,500 on Friday, a sale price lower than expected. The estimated price for the piano had been $800,000 to $1.2 million.
The 58-key piano is a memorable part of the romantic flashback sequence in Paris at La Belle Aurore, where Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) listen to Sam (Dooley Wilson) sing and play "As Time Goes By."
The piano is distinctive for its diminutive size and distinct hue. "Seeing the piano in real life you end up with a couple of things," said David Redden, vice chairman at Sotheby's.
"It's quite colorful, green and distressed yellow. And you don't realize how small it is, so small in fact Bogart and Bergman sort of tower over it."
Redden is no stranger to this famous Hollywood prop. He first auctioned it off back in 1988. "It was sold to a Japanese man and now it's come back to us," Redden told CNN. "He paid $154,000 for it."
On Friday, a pianist played "As Time Goes By" in the Sotheby's salesroom "before the piano was spun around on the turnstile to an awaiting audience and bought by a private collector," the auction house said.
The sale was greeted by applause, Sotheby's said.
The instrument had no significant value in the golden age of moviemaking, Redden added. "It would be re-used again and again," he said.
Many critics and movie-lovers regard "Casablanca" as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Michael Curtiz, it won three Oscars, and is replete with memorable lines and scenes.
"The piano is a star of the film," Redden said. "The music is so emotive, so moving and the piano really becomes a symbol of the love story between Bogart and Bergman."
Wilson, the actor who portrayed Sam, was a trumpeter, not a pianist, according to Redden.
"He is sort of miming the fingering. But someone else is playing nearby and he was following the real player," Redden said.
Now, the unknown new owner -- just a "citizen of the world," like the character Rick -- gets to tickle the ivories as time goes by.

Polio workers come under fresh attack in Pakistan
By Shaan Khan, CNN
updated 10:12 AM EST, Wed December 19, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Four attacks take place on Wednesday, killing three workers
On Tuesday, five workers are killed Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Health workers administering polio vaccinations came under fresh attack in Pakistan on Wednesday, a troubling development in a nation that remains one of three in the world where the disease has yet to be eradicated.
Three workers were killed in separate attacks, a day after five others died in similar circumstances.
All of them were part of a massive vaccination campaign nationwide.
The attacks prompted authorities to suspend the campaign throughout the country.

In Wednesday's attacks:
-- Two men opened fire on an 18-year-old worker as he was vaccinating children on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar. The worker died of bullet wounds to the head, said Dr. Janbaz Afridi, the provincial director of the polio campaign.
-- Gunmen opened fire on a car carrying a vaccination campaign supervisor and her driver in Charsadda -- killing them both.
-- Also in Charsadda, two female workers narrowly escaped when some men began shooting at them.
-- Three other female workers also escaped unhurt when they were shot at in Nowshera district.
All the attacks Wednesday took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province rife with Islamic extremists.
On Tuesday, five workers were killed: four in Karachi; and a 14-year-old volunteer in Peshawar as she and her sister were leaving a house after administering vaccines.
Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there.
Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011.
In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said.
CNN was not able to reach the Taliban for comment regarding the latest attacks.
Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan.
After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 last year to 53 this year, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

Prosecution pushes death penalty for Colorado theater shooting suspect
From Jim Spellman, Hunter Parsons and Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN
updated 5:48 AM EDT, Tue April 2, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A victim's father says James Holmes should get the same mercy he showed his victims
Prosecutor: "In this case ... justice is death"
The defense said last week Holmes would plead guilty to the avoid death penalty
Prosecutors criticized the move, saying it was done to generate publicity
Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- The man accused of killing a dozen people in a shooting rampage at a Colorado movie theater had offered to plead guilty if authorities would spare his life.
But the prosecutor denied that request Monday, announcing that he will seek the state's highest punishment for shooting suspect James Holmes: the death penalty.
"It is my determination and my intention that in this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death," Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said.
Speaking directly with dozens of victims' family members, Brauchler said, helped inform his choice.

FBI: Holmes' apartment rigged to kill
Many of them watched the prosecutor announce his intentions in court Monday.
Bryan Beard, whose close friend was killed in the massacre, said one thought ran through his mind: "Thank goodness. I am so happy this is happening."
"The only way death will receive justice when somebody murders somebody else is death," Beard told CNN Denver affiliate KMGH-TV during a break in Monday's court proceedings. "I guess you fight fire with fire."
Beard told reporters that if Holmes is executed, he wants to attend.
"I've already said, give me a front-row ticket."
New trial date
But the legal wrangling in the case is just revving up, and Holmes' trial won't begin until next year.
The trial was originally scheduled for August, but a judge Monday pushed back the start date to February 3 and said it could be delayed further. Once it starts, the trial is expected to last four months.
Public defender Tamara Brady argued that it is important to provide enough time to present arguments in the case.
"Your honor, this case is the most important matter this courtroom and this courthouse will ever hear," she said. "They're trying to execute our client."
Last week defense attorneys filed documents saying Holmes had offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life behind bars in exchange for avoiding the death penalty.
Prosecutors took the defense to task for publicly offering it, saying they hadn't been given enough information to even consider such a deal.
"Not only improper, but grossly improper," prosecutors said in a Thursday court filing. "For the intended purpose of generating predictable publicity."
The case against Holmes
Attorneys on both sides are under a gag order, leaving case watchers to divine tactics from court documents.
Federal agents have said the 25-year-old former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months.
Authorities said Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, then traveled to the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, armed with weapons, tear gas and body armor. He planned to ambush audience members during a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises," authorities said, and he did.
Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats.
At the end of the July 20 rampage, 12 people were dead and 58 were wounded.
Tom Teves, the father of shooting victim Alex Teves, told CNN's Piers Morgan Live Monday night that he thinks Holmes should get the same mercy he showed his victims.
"I have no interest in understanding him," he said. "My interest would be to see him exterminated."
Attorneys prepare an insanity defense
Holmes faces 166 counts of murder and attempted murder for the shooting.
Last month, a judge entered a standard plea of not guilty for Holmes.
His parents sat among reporters in the courtroom during Monday's hearing. As the prosecutor announced his plans to pursue the death penalty, Holmes' father put his arm around his mother. Both of them rocked back and forth.
Eerie sounds of cell phones amid disaster
Holmes' attorneys have suggested they intend to pursue an insanity defense.
In the documents filed last Wednesday, his attorneys said they were still exploring a mental health defense, "and counsel will vigorously present and argue any and all appropriate defenses at a trial or sentencing proceeding, as necessary."
Peter Burns was outraged at the possibility of an insanity defense.
His friend, Jessica Ghawi, was among those killed in the movie theater shooting. Holmes' distracted appearance in court, he said, doesn't jibe with the details investigators have revealed about a man who they said created and executed a detailed, deadly plan.
"I think this is an act," Burns told CNN Monday. "I think this coward that shows up every day in court with this aloof look in his eyes that he's just spaced out -- well, I can't imagine somebody pulling off something like this to be in that case. I think as soon as he knows he goes into the courtroom, he knows exactly what's going on."
Burns said he wanted Holmes to receive the toughest punishment possible, but he questioned whether the death penalty -- with the lengthy court proceedings and appeals that come with it -- was the right approach.
"We want justice, but at the same time we want closure," he said. "Do we ever really get closure 17 years down the road?"
CNN's Jim Spellman and journalist Hunter Parsons reported from Centennial, Colorado. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta. CNN's Ed Payne and Dana Ford contributed to this report.

Mubarak's retrial starts amid tight security By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 8:37 AM EDT, Sat May 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Court adjourned until June 8
Mubarak and others were convicted in connection with the killing of peaceful protesters Hundreds died during the Egyptian uprising in early 2011
Mubarak also faces corruption charges
(CNN) -- A medically-equipped helicopter ferried former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to court Saturday, where 3,000 security personnel were gathered to maintain peace, state TV reported.
At least 25 armored vehicles secured the court venue.
The former autocratic leader faces retrial in the killings of hundreds of civilian protesters who took to the streets for two weeks in early 2011 to demand his removal from office after three decades of rule.
Hundreds more civilians went missing during the revolution and remain unaccounted for.
Mubarak retrial starts, then stops again
Egypt's economy still struggling
Sectarian woes grow in Egypt
Past court appearances have stirred protests against him as well as impassioned supporters outside Cairo's police academy, where the trial is being held. Both sides have clashed violently in the past.
Mubarak appeared on the first day of the retrial with other defendants in a cage, where defendants are customarily seated for trial in Egypt. He lay on a stretcher but appeared alert and wore dark sunglasses. Family members of those killed gathered outside the police academy and remained calm.
Saturday's appearance follows a previous attempt at a retrial in April, which ended abruptly when a judge recused himself and walked out of the courtroom amid jeers from angry onlookers.
Some of them were relatives of protesters who were killed during the Egyptian revolution.
First convictions
The former strongman, who stepped down on February 11, 2011, and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings.
Mubarak's sons, his interior minister and six of his security aides also face trial.
The defendants were granted a retrial after appealing their convictions.
The six security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings, and Mubarak's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges. But they, too, were ordered to be retried after President Mohamed Morsy ordered a new investigation last year.
Mubarak's health
A public prosecutor has sent Mubarak -- who spent months detained in a military hospital -- back to prison last month, prosecutor spokesman Mahmoud Hefnawi told the state-run al-Ahram newspaper.
Mubarak's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had maintained that he was physically unfit to stand trial.
Hefnawi said the prosecutor reviewed a report of Mubarak's health and determined that he is fit to return to prison, the newspaper reported.
Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year.
He is also charged with seizing public funds and misusing political influence. He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value.
Mubarak and the other defendants plead not guilty Saturday to all charges. Court was adjourned until June 8.

Judge rejects conservatorship for Casey Kasem; finds wife taking good care of him
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 8:56 PM EST, Tue November 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Kasem's daughter and her husband filed a conservatorship petition last month
Kasem's daughters claim his wife is isolating the retired radio host from family and friends
A hearing on a permanent conservatorship is set for December
Kasem can't speak and "may have early onset Parkinson's dementia," a filing says
Los Angeles (CNN) -- A request by Casey Kasem's children that a temporary conservator be appointed for their ailing father was denied by a judge on Tuesday.
Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a Los Angeles court last month, claiming the retired radio host "has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family" by his wife.
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lesley Green ruled Tuesday that Kasem, 81, was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem.
"As my clients haven't had the opportunity to see their father for some months now, they were happy to learn through investigation of the court appointed expert and the probate investigator that their father was being physically well taken care of," said Andrew Katzenstein, the lawyer for Julie Kasem.
Kasem, who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows "American Top 40" and "Casey's Top 40," is suffering from Parkinson's disease and "may have early onset Parkinson's dementia," according to a court filing. He retired in 2009.
The children, who have been fighting with their stepmother, are hoping they can soon see their father, Katzenstein said. While they have not spoken to her, their lawyers are discussion a visitation plan, he said.
"Also they were happy that the judge focused her attention on the important issue of visitation," he said. "Mr. Kasem has a long strong and loving relationship with his adult children and we are continuing to try and reach resolution with the other side so visits can begin again."
Green will hold another hearing on December 20 to decide if she will appoint a permanent conservator.
Kasem has the "ability to shuffle short distances, but is mainly bedridden and requires the assistance of a wheelchair to move any distance," a court document said.
The petition claims that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions.
They "have been prevented from exercising their duties" by Jean Kasem, who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades, the filing contends.
"There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters," brother Mouner Kasem said Saturday. "We have no knowledge of how he is, what he's doing, if he's better, if he's worse, and we're scared that we'll never see him again."
The petition claims Kasem's wife has refused to provide the children with the name of their father's primary care physician. That doctor would be consulted to determine Kasem's "ability to act on his own behalf," which is the question that would cause the health care power of attorney to take effect, it said.
Daughter Kerri Kasem said last month that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him about three months ago. She said she was perplexed by the decision.
"I don't get it, I don't understand it," said Kerri Kasem, who co-hosts the radio show "Sixx Sense" with Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx. "He has Parkinson's, and all the research we've done indicates socialization would help him."
CNN has reached out to get a statement from Jean Kasem, but has been unsuccessful.
Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house to raise public attention to their dispute last month.
The fight is not about an inheritance, Kerri Kasem said.
"My dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will, and we're OK with that. We've known that for years," she said. "I've never asked him for anything, nor have I asked Jean for anything."
Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, said he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind.
"He has Parkinson's, has it very bad. It took his speech, and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift, that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating. But he's handling it very well," Pitts said. "His mind is very sharp, his brain works well. You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you're saying. He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords."
Besides the famed countdown shows, Casey Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon "Scooby Doo" and an announcer for NBC. He was a popular DJ and occasional actor before "American Top 40" began in 1970.
