LONDON, England (CNN) -- A leading human rights group has called on Iraq's neighbors to open their borders to admit fleeing Iraqi civilians as aid agencies prepare for the impact of war.
"The United Nations has estimated that there will then be about two million refugees," Amnesty International's Kamal Samari told CNN on Wednesday. "It is their right to flee the conflict and it is the obligation of the neighboring countries to offer protection."
Meanwhile, the United Nations said war would trigger a major humanitarian disaster in a country already crippled by more than a decade of sanctions.
In the short term, food would be urgently needed to feed about 10 million people, while Iraq could face, in the worst-case scenario, widespread starvation and epidemics, said the U.N.'s aid official in charge of Iraq, Ramiro Lopez da Silva.
Aid agencies are preparing contingencies to cope with an exodus and are ready to spring into action once they are called upon to assist. But the U.N. has made it clear that it will not operate under the auspices of "military governor in Baghdad," said Samari.
British aid agency Oxfam said earlier this week it would not work under any U.S.-run postwar government. The United Nations must enter Iraq quickly after hostilities cease to co-ordinate humanitarian and reconstruction work so as not to place their workers in danger and compromise their impartiality, the agency said.
The U.S. military has said frontline troops would carry food rations to hand out to hungry civilians, but humanitarian workers say soldiers and aid do not mix.
According to UK-based Care International, if military action occurs 10 million people will need food immediately, 39 percent of the population will have no clean water while five million would lack access to health care.
"We are extremely worried that vital infrastructure could be damaged by the massive bombing campaign," said Kaye Stearman of Care International. "We're fearful of a humanitarian catastrophe. The water supplies is dependent on the electricity."
"If that is damaged then we'll have a repeat of the last Gulf War when the water and sewage system collapses, spreading sewage over the streets. That caused disease and many more people died because of that than the bombing. And people are still suffering."
Stearman said that there was unlikely to be an exodus as the "Iraqi people are malnourished and have no resources left. Many have sold what little resources they have and have decided to stock up for a stay in the city."
None of the humanitarian aid agencies could place a figure on how much they had set aside for war relief but could launch appeals once it becomes clear what damage has been done.
Relief agencies are stockpiling food and emergency supplies, such as tents and medicines, in countries around Iraq and are in discussions with all sides about access to civilians.
Sixty percent of Iraqis depend entirely on food rations imported under the U.N.'s oil-for-food programs, and household supplies could run out within weeks if distributions stop.

(CNN) -- Iran has hanged a man convicted of spying for Israel and also executed another man who was a member of a government opposition group, state-run media reported Tuesday. The executions took place at Tehran's Evin Prison at dawn Tuesday. Ali-Akbar Siadat was sentenced to death for working as a spy for Israeli intelligence. The Islamic Republic News Agency said Siadat admitted to transferring information to Israel over several years in exchange for $60,000. He was arrested in 2008 while trying to leave Iran along with his wife, the news agency said. A second man, Ali Saremi, was hanged for "fighting against the sacred Islamic Republic of Iran system and launching antagonist propagations," the agency reported. He was a member of People's Mujahedeen of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, which has opposed the Iranian government for decades. Tehran considers the group to be a terrorist outfit, as does the United States. The European Union does not. Members of a European Parliament group, Friends of a Free Iran Intergroup, condemned Saremi's execution Tuesday, calling it "another crime for which the mullahs will be held to account when freedom is finally restored to that beleaguered nation." The group also demanded that Iranian leaders "be tried in the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity."CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.

Shocking rape video goes viral in South Africa
By Nkepile Mabuse, CNN
updated 5:52 PM EDT, Thu April 19, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Youths aged 14 to 20 are arrested over a cell phone video showing a rape
A newspaper got hold of the video and handed it to police
A government minister says the case will be a priority
Tens of thousands of women are raped in South Africa every year
Johannesburg (CNN) -- South Africans woke up on Wednesday morning to the claim that a group of Soweto youths had filmed themselves raping a 17-year-old girl believed to be mentally ill.
The cellphone video is said to have gone viral among school kids in the township south of Johannesburg, and the term #rapevideo was trending on Twitter in South Africa on Wednesday.
The Daily Sun, a local tabloid, reports that it alerted the police after a concerned mother whose daughter was watching the video handed it over to the paper on Tuesday.
"The mother of a teenage girl saw the horrifying pictures and confiscated her daughter's phone. A work colleague of the woman said they recognized some of the boys and advised her to take the video to Daily Sun," the newspaper reported.
The suspects, aged between 14 and 20, were arrested Tuesday morning and charged with kidnapping and rape, police spokesperson Warrant Officer Kay Makhubela said.
"The video is very bad. The men can be clearly identified as they take turns raping and filming her," she told CNN.
The girl's mother reported her missing on March 21, Makhubela said.
Media reports suggest the police initially failed to open a missing persons case but that they have since done so.
Police suspect the girl was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave.
A local radio station got hold of the video and has been getting requests to post it.

A victim's quest for justice
On Twitter, Eyewitness News editor Katy Katopodis said the station would never do that.
"To those asking for the #rapevideo link that #EWN reported on today. Stop! Not happening! We'd never put it on our site. Illegal & wrong," she tweeted.
The distribution of pornographic material is illegal in South Africa.
The station reports that the gang of men promised the girl 25 cents for her silence.
"The girl can be heard pleading with the boys to stop. They crudely jest and crassly spur one another on," journalist Mandy Weiner reported.
NGOs estimate a woman is raped every 26 seconds in the country.
According to the latest police statistics more than 60,000 cases of sexual assault were reported in the year to March 2011, down from 70,000 in 2008.
A popular radio talk show host broke down Wednesday morning as she encouraged listeners to come up with solutions to the problem.
Women's rights activist Lisa Vetten says in the province of Gauteng, where Johannesburg is located, one in every five rapes is a gang rape.
"Rape is a young man's crime. It's a bit of a performance for them, showing off to each other how macho they are. We need to teach our young men that you can be masculine in ways that do not involve violence and degrading women," she said.
The government is well aware that the problem needs urgent attention, experts say.
"We are not lacking in terms of legal instruments to deal with this kind of thing. What we lack are ways of making these instruments effective," said Nomboniso Gasa, an expert on gender and culture.
The country has created a ministry of women and children precisely to deal with violence against women and other related matters.
Its minister Lulu Xingwana says this case will be be a high priority.
"I will speak to the minister of police to ensure that this case is prioritized. Distributing child porn is illegal in this country so the police must confiscate this video," she said in a radio interview.
The newspaper that broke the story says they were the ones that informed the victim's mother.
The tearful woman reportedly said her daughter had been a victim of rape since the age of 12.
"People took advantage of her illness and because my family is poor," the Sun quoted her as saying.
Police did not confirm her mental ability or allegations she had been raped before.

The myth of the 'drunk phone'
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 11:53 AM EDT, Thu July 19, 2012 | Filed under: Mobile
Afraid of losing or breaking your smartphone during a bout of partying? Consider a "drunk phone."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some young adults are taking cheap "dumb" phone to bars instead of smartphones
Many people who have lost phones in bars still won't leave their iPhone at home
A new prepaid feature phone can cost as little as $10
(CNN) -- Some young adults are so fond of their expensive smartphones that they take a cheaper backup phone with them to bars and leave their fancier phones at home where they are safe from spilled vodka tonics, pickpockets and uncoordinated drunk people.
That's according to consumer-behavior expert Laura Krajecki of the Starcom MediaVest Group, who stumbled upon the trend while researching beer and shared it with AdAge. "They take what they call their 'drunk phone' ... because they don't want to lose their smartphone," she said.
CNN's independent research yielded different results, however.
An exhausting, though hardly exhaustive, survey of bar patrons in San Francisco this past weekend turned up zero people who had opted to carry a beater phone out with them on a night of drinking. Nor did any interview subjects know other people who had ever done such a thing.
But as seasoned bartender Jerome Bishop put it, "I've never heard of anybody doing that, but it doesn't mean they don't."
It's possible the people in watering holes visited by this reporter were not young enough (are college students more likely to binge drink and lose things?), well-off enough (a stream of secondary phones can add up), or beta testing top secret phones for their Silicon Valley employers.
Interestingly, while the mythical back-up phone was nowhere to be found, carrying multiple phones was not uncommon. Two friends at Churchill bar were hauling around their assigned work phones -- both BlackBerrys, of course -- in addition to their personal handsets.
Many people admitted to having lost their phones while drinking in the past but were still set on taking their smartphones with them on nights out.
"Sh** breaks, it's expensive. If you're not ready to take ownership of it, don't buy it," advised Eric, a guest at a costume party in the Lower Haight neighborhood. Eric recently lost his iPhone at Bay to Breakers -- a boisterous alcohol-soaked run through the city -- but quickly bought a new one. It was stashed safely away in a pocket under his pirate ensemble.
Nathan also knew the pain of losing an expensive smartphone after one too many.
After buying the first iPhone just days after it was released ($600 for the phone plus the $150 to cancel an existing Verizon contract), Nathan took it to a bar where he showed it off to friends. When he awoke the next morning, his phone was nowhere to be found. He bought a new one and hasn't lost sight of it since.
Asked whether he'd consider swapping it out for a "dumb" phone if it was available, he said, "No, I'd probably still take my iPhone. I need my maps. And Shazam."
It seems smartphone features have become too integral to too many people's lives to just leave behind, whether it's the camera for documenting good times or GPS for getting home from good times.
"I always want to have my good phone with me. If you get into an argument, you want to be able to look the answer up. I need my smartphone," said Bishop.
But if Krajecki's data is to be believed, some think a "drunk phone" is a sound idea whose time has come. So how do you go about getting your very own companion phone?
The easiest way to receive all your calls on a secondary phone isn't to mess with SIM cards or contracts -- just buy the least expensive prepaid phone you can find. After all, this is a phone you're wagering could be left behind in a roadhouse latrine somewhere.
The cost of a phone jumps as soon as you try to get it without a contract, but there are still plenty of steals to be found. You can pick up a used phone on Craigslist or eBay, but if you're after that new-phone smell, you can drop $10 on a Samsung Trackfone at Best Buy.
To receive your calls on this second phone, our friends at Time.com's Techland suggest a service such as Google Voice. However, it's probably easier to just turn on call forwarding on your smartphone before you head out. Take a few minutes to enter the key phone numbers into your second phone -- the local cab company, your preferred late-night romantic dial.
This brings us to one of the unexpected advantages of taking a secondary phone on the go. You can decide ahead of time, while you're still sober and of sound body and mind, whose number you should have in your phone.
If you're using a truly dumb phone, there is no Twitter or Facebook, no work e-mail and no ex-boyfriend on speed dial (assuming you haven't memorized his digits). You've greatly decreased the chances of accidentally humiliating yourself after a third martini.
At Nova, a bar in San Francisco's startup-filled SOMA district, Bishop sees plenty of phones left behind. He holds on to them and waits for the owner return or to call their own phone. Maybe those handsets should be called "drunk phones," too.
So do you carry a "drunk phone" when you go out for a night of revelry? Or can you not part with your valuable smartphone? Are there other times and places you'd opt to take a cheaper phone? Share your communications strategy with us in the comments section below or go to iReport.

Democratic Republic of Congo rebels say they will leave captured Goma
From David McKenzie, CNN
updated 4:59 PM EST, Wed November 28, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: U.N. Security Council extends sanctions against rebel groups in Congo until 2014
M23 Rebels are seen packing, but giving mixed signals about leaving
Regional leaders and the African Union called on the M23 to begin a withdrawal Tuesday
The rebels want to talk with the Congolese president about breaches of a 2009 peace treaty
(CNN) -- Members of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's M23 rebel movement said Wednesday they would withdraw from the captured city of Goma in line with a demand by regional leaders and the African Union.
The M23 forces will pull back to a position about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Goma, officers and soldiers from the group told CNN.
They will also leave a 100-strong contingent at the city's airport, as foreseen under a plan drawn up by African leaders who convened in neighboring Uganda over the weekend, the M23 officers and soldiers said.
The rebels will keep their administration in Goma, they added.
Goma is a key city in the eastern part of the country that rebels seized last week after days of fighting with government forces. It remained calm Wednesday morning as people sought to go about their normal business.
The M23 rebel group is fighting the Democratic Republic of Congo military for control of the country, and the violence is driving tens of thousands of Congolese out of their homes. Here on November 22, thousands fled the town of Sake and headed east to the camps for displaced in the village of Mugunga.
On November 26, M23 commanders refused to leave the city of Goma ahead of a midnight deadline imposed by regional leaders and the African Union. Pictured, rebel soldiers stand guard at the former Congolese army headquarters in Goma, on November 23, 2012.

Crisis escalates in DR Congo
Life in Goma amid crisis
Congolese rebels take over Goma
On Wednesday evening, M23 rebels were seen packing their equipment to possibly move out of Goma, but the group continued to give mixed signals about whether they would go.
The M23 helped orchestrate a rally of mostly young men to show who supported the group.
Several hundred protesters carried placards calling for President Joseph Kabila to stand down and saying "yes to the revolution." Some complained about tribal discrimination.
Humanitarian groups have warned of an impending crisis in the area.
More than 140,000 people have been displaced by the latest violence, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region.

African leaders who convened in Uganda over the weekend demanded that the M23 group withdraw from Goma as a condition of initiating negotiations. The Great Lakes region leaders called on the rebels to "stop all war activities" and "stop talk of overthrowing an elected government."
It also called on the Congolese government to listen to the rebels' grievances and to seek to resolve them.
The U.N. Security Council added its own demands Wednesday, condemning any outside forces supporting M23 and not impeding the flow of weapons in the area.
The Security Council also extended the arms embargo and other sanctions imposed against armed rebel groups in the Congo, while expressing its intention to consider additional targeted sanctions against the leadership of the M23. The sanctions, which were imposed in 2003 as the civil war in Congo ended, will be extended until February 1, 2014.
The Council also asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to renew the mandate of the group of experts monitoring these measures until February 1, 2014.
The group was named for a peace deal reached on March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating.
Its demands include the release of political prisoners, the investigation of alleged targeted killings in the country, the dismissal of the national election commission and the examination of the results of last year's election.

Over the weekend, the Great Lakes region leaders hatched a plan that calls for an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at Goma airport. It would include a 100-strong neutral force, which would be in command, 100 troops from the Congolese army and 100 members of the M23.
The Congolese army should be back on the streets of Goma on Thursday, according to the proposal.

M23 political leader Jean-Marie Runiga, who earlier said that the rebels would hold their ground until negotiations started with the Congolese government and their conditions were met, appeared to soften his stance Wednesday.
He said withdrawal was possible out of respect for the calls from regional leaders.
Runiga said that the rebels wanted to sit down and discuss the March 23 agreement with civil society, the government and a broad spectrum of the Congolese people to come up with lasting solutions on good governance, democracy, the economy and security.
Runiga said the M23 would maintain a humanitarian corridor, and he called on people to respect the role of MONUSCO, the U.N. peacekeeping force in the region mandated to protect civilians.
MONUSCO forces took a back seat as army forces battled the rebels for control of the city last week.

Col. Olivier Hamuli, a Congolese army spokesman, said the armed forces were awaiting guidance from the government and would abide by a cease-fire until they were told to do otherwise.
The United Nations has called on the rebels to lay down their arms and withdraw immediately from Goma.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday that aid groups had been able to resume deliveries to sites around Goma over the weekend, after fighting caused days of disruption. The U.N. refugee agency said it was trying to reach 110,000 people with supplies of food, soap and water containers.
Many of those who have fled to refugee camps around Goma are in urgent need of shelter and clean water, the UNHCR said.
"Sanitary conditions remain a major challenge due to the lack of toilets and water supply points," it said. Cases of vomiting, diarrhea and respiratory infections have already been recorded, it said, with the last due to people having to sleep outside without shelter from the rain.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen far more than its share of violence over the decades. Civil wars -- most recently in the 1990s through 2003 -- have left millions dead across the country and displaced entire generations.

Flu vaccine less effective, especially among elderly
By Ashley Hayes, CNN
updated 1:23 PM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The flu vaccine showed 9% effectiveness among those 65 and older, CDC says
The vaccine was about 56% effective in adults and children, it says
New numbers show flu cases are declining in most areas
(CNN) -- This year's flu vaccine was less effective than officials previously thought, particularly for the elderly, said officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Officials have said the worst may be over and flu cases are declining. The 2012-13 flu season began in December, much earlier than usual, and was more severe than last year's.
That particularly was true for those 65 or older, according to a CDC report Thursday. The vaccine was 9% effective in protecting people in that age group.
"One possible explanation for this is that some older people did not mount an effective immune response to the H3N2 component of this season's vaccine," the report said. "However, it's not possible to say that for sure."
An H3N2 flu strain has been the most dominant and has been especially hard on the elderly.
Among those over 65, 146 per 100,000 were hospitalized for the flu virus, compared with a rate of 30 per 100,000 last year, the CDC said.
Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director, said this month in a congressional hearing that about twice as many elderly people have been hospitalized with flu symptoms than in recent years. That includes the 2007-08 and 2003-04 seasons, which also saw a predominant H3N2 strain.
"It seems that this year's flu vaccine is not nearly as effective as we would like among people over the age of 65 for one particular strain of flu," Frieden said Thursday. "That's why early treatment is so important."
Officials maintained, however, that those 65 and older should be vaccinated yearly, for reasons including that this population is at high risk of serious illness, hospitalization and death from the flu.
"This flu season has been worse than average and particularly severe for the elderly," Frieden said. "Although it's far from perfect, flu vaccination is by far the best tool we have to protect from the flu."
Authorities earlier had said the flu vaccine was 62% effective for adults and children. In the Thursday report, the CDC revised that to 56%.
The new number, the agency said, is "not significantly different" and continues to fall within the confidence interval established earlier. But the lower number includes an additional three weeks of data and was adjusted for various factors, including age and race or ethnicity.
"Both estimates indicate moderate vaccine effectiveness in preventing outpatient medical visits due to circulating flu viruses in most of the population," the report said.
In addition, while this year's vaccine was considered a good match for the most common circulating flu viruses, it only provided 47% protection against H3N2, the main virus.
"We simply need a better vaccine against influenza, one that works better and lasts longer," Frieden said. The Department of Health and Human Services as well as the private sector are working on such a project, he said.
In addition, less than half of school-age children -- the population mainly responsible for spreading the flu virus -- got the flu shot, experts said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for those 6 months of age and older.
According to the latest numbers released Friday by the CDC, "influenza activity remained elevated in the United States, but decreased in most areas."

Ricin suspect ordered held without bond
By Ed Payne and Vivian Kuo, CNN
updated 8:01 PM EDT, Mon April 29, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: More details of investigation expected to be unsealed this week
Magistrate orders James Everett Dutschke held without bond
Dutschke is charged with possessing and using ricin as a weapon
He is accused of sending letters containing ricin to President Barack Obama and others Oxford, Mississippi (CNN) -- The Mississippi man accused of making a potent toxin found in letters mailed to President Barack Obama and other officials will be held without bond pending a preliminary hearing later this week, a federal magistrate ruled Monday.
Federal authorities arrested James Everett Dutschke, 41, on Saturday on charges of possessing and using ricin after initially charging -- and then clearing -- another man with whom Dutschke has sometimes feuded.
Wearing an orange jumpsuit, and his hands and feet shackled as he entered the courtroom, Dutschke told Magistrate S. Allan Alexander that he understood what he had been charged with.
His attorney, George Lucas, told Alexander that they had not yet had time to go through the complaint.
Ex-ricin suspect describes interrogation
Lawyer for ex-suspect: He was framed
Ex-ricin suspect sings CNN Explains: Ricin
Alexander agreed to order Dutschke held without bond on grounds he could be a danger to the community or could try to run.
She set a preliminary hearing for Thursday.
Both Lucas and Assistant U.S. Attorney Chad Lamar declined to comment.
While the eight-minute proceeding produced no new details, the public could learn more about the accusations when the criminal affidavit in support of the complaint is unsealed.
That is now expected to occur at the preliminary hearing, according to the Justice Department.
Dutschke's arrest was the latest head-scratching twist in what could be a tale of small-town intrigue that blew up to become international news.
The letters -- sent to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Sadie Holland, a local judge, arrived April 16 and touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the bombing of the Boston Marathon. The two incidents were unconnected, officials said.
Before police settled on Dutschke as a suspect, they took into custody a Corinth, Mississippi, man named Paul Kevin Curtis, who makes his living impersonating Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis.
Curtis vehemently denied sending the letters, said he was framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.
What is ricin?
The ties that bind
Dutschke used to work for Curtis' brother at an insurance company, under the direction of Curtis' ex-wife.
Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out.
He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the latter has denied.
In an April 22 court hearing before the charges were dropped, Curtis said he was being framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.
Dutschke told reporters last week that he did not know Curtis well.
"He's just a little nutty," he said. "I don't have a relationship with him."
The ties that bind II
So where do the lawmakers fit in?
Dutschke can be linked to Sadie Holland through her son, Democratic state representative Steve Holland.
Dutschke failed in a bid as a Republican to unseat the younger Holland.
As for Curtis, Sadie Holland presided over a 2004 assault hearing involving Curtis, who says he has been in jail "over 20 times," but never convicted.
And Wicker?
Dutschke said he once met Wicker.
Suspect No. 1
The letters read, in part: "To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."
They were signed "I am KC and I approve this message," a source told CNN.
Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.
The very next day, authorities arrested Curtis.
His attorney, Christi McCoy, said he'd been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media.
The FBI said the letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote.
The very next week, authorities dropped the charges against Curtis after they said they had new information.
"I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily," he told CNN last week after being cleared.
Suspect No. 2
The feds then turned their attention to Dutschke.
Agents searched his residence and former martial arts studio. Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search "to help clear my name."
"I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters," he said.
Early Saturday, he was arrested without incident at home. He was charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with the letters.
More trouble
This isn't his only brush with the law.
Dutschke faces molestation charges in an unrelated case.
According to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. He has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media and pleaded not guilty in court this month.
Dutschke closed his tae kwon do studio after the allegations were made public.
Dutschke was previously convicted on indecent exposure charges in another case and sentenced to 90 days in jail.
A song in his heart
As for Curtis, he told CNN he's "just glad it's over."
When he learned Dutschke had been arrested, he took a deep breath and felt like "a weight had been taken off."
"I just want to return to my kids and my music," Curtis said.
During another interview with CNN last week, he said the public attention could "thrust him into the limelight."
And then, at the urging of reporter Chris Cuomo, he burst into song.
A rousing rendition of Randy Travis' "On the Other Hand."
CNN's Vivian Kuo reported from Oxford, Mississippi; Rich Phillips and Alina Machado from Booneville, Mississippi. Ed Payne wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Dana Ford and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.

Overtested Americans: When cancer isn't cancer at all By Jacque Wilson and Amanda Enayati, CNN
updated 2:44 PM EDT, Wed July 31, 2013
We all harbor abnormalities, says H. Gilbert Welch, author of "Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
National Cancer Institute scientists say the word "cancer" is sometimes misleading
Not everyone who is diagnosed with cancer should be treated, experts say
Unnecessary tests and treatment may account for 10% to 30% of health care spending
(CNN) -- The patient slammed his fist on the table in Dr. Otis Brawley's office.
"Dammit, I'm American," Brawley remembers him saying. "You can't tell me I have prostate cancer and that we're just going to 'watch it.'"
Brawley is the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, a world-renowned cancer expert and practicing oncologist. If you're going to get someone's opinion on a cancer diagnosis or course of treatment, he's a good choice. And in this case, he was recommending no treatment.
It's a scenario that may happen more as science reveals cancer's secrets, the biggest one being that what we now call cancer maybe shouldn't be called cancer at all.
"The word 'cancer' often invokes the specter of an inexorably lethal process," a working group for the National Cancer Institute wrote in a recent recommendation. "However, cancers are heterogeneous and can follow multiple paths, not all of which progress to metastases and death."
Basically, cancer is scary, but some kinds may be more boogeyman-in-the-closet scary than serial killer scary.
To understand fully, you have to look at the history of cancer diagnosis, Brawley says. In the 1850s, a group of German pathologists did some of the first biopsies on people who had clearly died of cancer. They took samples of their tumors and decided what breast cancer looks like, what lung cancer looks like, etc.
Today, Brawley says, there is a patient who has a lesion that's approximately 5 millimeters in diameter -- smaller than a pea. There's a doctor taking a biopsy of that lesion and a pathologist who's analyzing the sample using 21st-century technology. The problem, Brawley says, is that they're still comparing the samples to the cancer definition that was created more than 150 years ago.
New cancer screening guidelines issued
Screening smokers may save lives
Mom and child diagnosed with cancer
"He's going, 'This looks just like what those Germans said is breast cancer,' " Brawley said of the pathologist. "But it's 5 millimeters in size. What killed the woman 160 years ago had spread all throughout her body."
We all harbor abnormalities, says H. Gilbert Welch, Dartmouth professor of medicine and author of the book "Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health." And new technology is increasingly able to find these abnormalities. When we do, our inclination is to act, even when the remedy turns out to be far more harmful than the disease would have been, had it run its course.
There is a growing consensus, backed by mounting scientific evidence, that Americans tend to be overtested, overdiagnosed and overtreated across a variety of conditions. Some experts estimate that unnecessary interventions account for 10% to 30% of U.S. health care spending.
Part of the problem is our medical culture, Welch says. The physician may be engaging in what is known as "defensive medicine," which entails ordering tests to guard against malpractice suits, should something go awry. There may also be perverse economic incentives at play -- that is, in a fee-for-service system, doctors are compensated for the quantity of tests and procedures they order.
But a recent study of physicians with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that salaried physicians who received no income from an increased volume of services and who had limited liability concerns ordered as many heart stress tests deemed "unnecessary" as doctors in more traditional settings.
The researchers theorized that the doctors had "an exaggerated perception of benefit" of the tests. In an editor's note on the study, Dr. Deborah Grady observed that while the study sample was small, "neverthless, it suggests that the culture of overdoing is ingrained."
Simply put, physicians are trained to think that the way you take care of people is to "find stuff and to take care of that stuff," Welch says.
Patients aren't exactly helping the issue, either. Energized by public awareness cancer campaigns, many patients have been empowered to find cancer early through screening and to intervene as soon as possible, Welch observes.
"To raise awareness and to get people to participate in screening, we have to whip up fear; we must introduce a bit of 'dis-ease' into the population," he said. "In a way, we have to make them feel as if the world may be a more dangerous place and that they ought to be worried about their future."
Brawley's patient, the one he refused to treat, eventually found another doctor who would treat his prostate cancer. "Patients will doctor-shop until they get what they want," Brawley said.
It's an issue many people have difficulty wrapping their heads around: Some patients who are diagnosed with cancer do not need to be treated, because that cancer is never going to bother them. The problem is that we don't know who those people are.
"There is a lot of work and research in this area in trying to better characterize which tumors will matter," Welch said.
The National Cancer Institute working group made several recommendations for the medical community in addressing cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment. One was a change in the terminology doctors use to talk about cancer, especially when the cells they've found may not be dangerous.
"Use of the term 'cancer' should be reserved for describing lesions with a reasonable likelihood of lethal progression if left untreated," they wrote.
They also noted that the public should be made aware that overdiagnosis is common in cancer screening.
Doctors know that approximately 10% of localized lung cancer tumors and 20% to 30% of localized breast cancer tumors that are found through screening would never cause harm, Brawley says. "That tumor would just stay there: never grow, never spread." The rate is even higher for prostate cancer at 60%.
Tell us your story!
We love to hear from our audience. Follow @CNNHealth on Twitter and Facebook for the latest health news and let us know what we're missing.
But isn't screening used to catch some aggressive cancers in people that we would otherwise see too late to treat?
Some overdiagnosis is acceptable, Brawley says. "We cure and treat some people who don't need to be treated. And in return, we save some lives." But screening has its own dangers.
Whenever you test a population, you will have some false positives. For example, if a woman is told that her mammogram is abnormal, that diagnosis might be straightened out days or weeks later, and she might find out that she does not have cancer. The diagnosis will create anxiety and lead to additional unnecessary testing.
Good health is more than absence of physical abnormality; it's also a state of mind, experts say.
"In my experience, it's not the diagnosis of cancer which really kills people," said Ezekiel Emanuel, a former oncologist, vice provost for global initiatives and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. "It's the uncertainty."
The National Cancer Institute group recommended reducing the frequency of some screening examinations, focusing that screening on high-risk groups (e.g. screening smokers for lung cancer) and raising the requirements that would lead to a biopsy or other follow up care.
"We've been taught that cancer is a terrible thing and the way to deal with it always is to find it early and cut it out," Brawley said. "We're starting to realize that that is not true in all cases."

White House Scandal At A Glance
The latest developments in the story include:
Monica Lewinsky lawyer William Ginsburg will talk tonight with the staff of the Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, sources have told CNN. A senior Clinton Administration told CNN that it was "highly unlikely" that President Clinton will give "anything" in the way of a statement, interview, or press conference regarding the allegations before the State of the Union next Tuesday.
Ginsburg says Lewinsky is being "squeezed" by Starr and is a target of the probe. Ginsburg says she could be indicted and charged with one or more crimes. He has had no offer of immunity from prosecution from Starr. Ginsburg says Starr "trying to scare a 24-year-old girl into thinking she is going to jail." Ginsburg confirmed that he was asking Starr to make him an immunity offer he could live with, but said he could not say if Lewinsky would cooperate with Starr.
Sources in Kenneth Starr's office say he is not interested in indicting Monica Lewinsky, but in building case against the president and Vernon Jordan.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says, "I believe the allegations [against Clinton] are completely untrue." Her statement follows cabinet meeting with president.
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson's office gets subpoena from Kenneth Starr asking for records relating to Lewinsky. Spokeswoman says she expects Richardson will be called to testify before Whitewater grand jury.
Paula Jones' attorney, Donovan Campbell, said Jones is "saddened" by allegations. Says they want Monica Lewinsky to tell the truth. Says if true, the allegations will reinforce Jones' attempt to show pattern of past improper conduct on part of the president.
President Clinton considering pre-State-of-the-Union news conference to explain in detail his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But administration source says it is "highly unlikely" that Clinton will give anything in the way of a
statement, interview, or press conference on the allegations before next Tuesday.
Judge Susan Webber Wright puts off "indefinitely" a deposition Lewinsky was scheduled to give to Paula Jones' attorneys. Her attorney said she intended to invoke her constitutional right against self-incrimination.
Sources say Monica Lewinsky visited the White House at least once last month.
The president's personal secretary, Betty Currie, and other aides have been subpoenaed to appear before the Whitewater grand jury.
In affidavit Monica Lewinsky said, "I have the utmost respect for the president, who always behaved appropriately in my presence. I have never had a sexual relationship with the president. He did not propose that we have a sexual relationship, he did not offer me employment or other benefits in exchange for sexual relationships. He did not deny me employment or other benefits for rejecting a sexual relationship."
