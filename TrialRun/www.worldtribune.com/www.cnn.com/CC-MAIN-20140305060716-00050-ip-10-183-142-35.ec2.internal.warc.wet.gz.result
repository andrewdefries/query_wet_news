How your attitude can impact your careerStory Highlights Your attitude toward work might impact your career more than you realize A numb approach to work raises questions about your performance If you do hate your job, you might be in need of a job or career change Don't look at every bad day as the worst day in history of human existence Next Article in Living » By Anthony Balderrama CareerBuilder.com writer	Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com.
Don't be like teenagers who think every bad day is the worst day ever to possibly happen to anyone. Attitude counts for a lot. Just think of how often people's attitudes affect your perception of them. First impressions often include come down to phrases such as "He had the worst attitude" or "She has the best attitude of anyone I've ever met." When you walk into your workplace -- whether it's a department store or hospital -- what are you thinking? Do you feel excited because you love your job? Are you filled with dread because you hate your job? Your attitude toward work might impact your career more than you realize. The runway model When models work the catwalk, they act as if the audience isn't there. The flashbulbs blind them, but their faces seem to say, "I don't have time to care about this crowd; I have a catwalk to strut down." They're on emotionless autopilot, if you will. What works for models doesn't work for everyone ... in case that unsuccessful liquid diet you tried wasn't enough proof. A numb approach to work raises questions about your performance: Do you care about your job? Do you know what you're doing? How long will you stick around? Does anyone even want to interact with you? Todd Dewett, associate professor of management at Wright State University, suggests these workers take a step back to look at their work in its appropriate context.

"All work is interdependent, yet most people have difficulty understanding where much of their work came from and where it will go -- they don't see the connections in the larger process," he says. "The more someone understands how their work impacts others, the more they are likely to care." Dewett advises you to think of yourself as part of a team working toward a goal, not as an isolated cog in a machine. Look at the end result of your hard work and maybe you can find a reason to care about your job, even if you don't love it. The emotional teenager Teenagers are nothing if not experts at looking at the cruel, torturous underbelly of life. A bad day when you're 15 years old isn't just a bad day; it's the worst day anyone has ever experienced in the history of human existence. Every phone call is a life-altering conversation of importance no one can comprehend. Hyperbolic workers aren't too different. They don't know how to put their workdays in perspective. Yes, some jobs are nightmares incarnate, but no job is nirvana, either. Difficult customers or incompetent bosses can mar the occasional day. Are you able to draw a distinction between a bad day and a bad situation? "It is possible to frame things mentally such that you see them as only short-term realities that can change over time. From this 'glass half-full' perspective, any single bad role or colleague is but a few frames in a long roll of film. The focus then shifts from obsessing on the current situation to designing a real plan of action to create a new and better future situation." On the flip side, rather than make you appreciate your job more, a new perspective might make you realize you belong elsewhere. If you're conditioned to despise work every time the alarm rings, you could end up stuck at a job that's just wrong for you. "If you do actually hate your job, you might not be in need [of] a job tweak, but rather a full-fledged job change or career change," Dewett suggests. "Having said that, even in the worst professional situations, for the open minded, there is a lot to learn about how you got there and what [likely exists] there that will help you avoid it completely in the future." Pollyanna The classic children's book "Pollyanna," which follows a girl whose philosophy to focus on the positive, is an admirable, if not impossible, model to follow. Yet, some workers' abilities to convey Pollyanna's unrelenting optimism astound others and can be detrimental to their own careers. The drawback to this work method is that you might find yourself out of the loop when it comes to how decisions are made, as they aren't always made in open discussions. Dewett cautions workers to pay attention to how decisions are made so that they can be aware of or participate in the process. "People with overly rosy views (due to solid 'fit,' a great boss or colleagues or both) can be somewhat naïve politically," Dewett warns. "I would never advocate that a person with character and rosy glasses engage in too much political behavior, but you need to be aware of it." Don't sacrifice the love you have of your job. After all, many people would be thrilled to enjoy going to work in the morning. A balanced perspective is all you need. "Love your job, love your company -- but use your network so that you keep up to speed with the major political currents of the day as they might affect you and your work unit."

Bodies found at Turkish helicopter crash siteStory Highlights 6 confirmed dead after helicopter crash in Turkey Great Union Party head Muhsin Yazicioglu was involved in crash Helicopter crashed in mountainous region, five other passengers on board Turkish TV stations broadcasted harrowing emergency call from chopperNext Article in World » Read VIDEO By Ivan Watson	ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Forty-eight hours after a harrowing distress call from a helicopter crash survivor in the mountains of eastern Turkey, Turkey's interior minister said Friday that rescuers have finally discovered the wreckage. Soldiers tramp through snow and ice as they search for the downed helicopter. None of the six people onboard the helicopter when it went down Wednesday survived to be rescued, CNN Turk reported. The rescue effort, which involved thousands of soldiers, police and volunteers, has been severely hampered by deep snow and high mountains. One of the rescuers who reached the wreckage Friday afternoon said he could see the bodies of three passengers, including the news reporter whose emergency call was the last communication from the aircraft after the crash. "The helicopter broke into pieces, and the wreckage is spread across the ground," Abidin told CNN sister network CNN Turk by telephone. He said the visibility was terrible because of heavy snow. Abidin added that the rescue party had to build a fire to stay warm, and that they themselves were now waiting for a helicopter to transport them away from the frigid mountaintop. The rented helicopter was taking Muhsin Yazicioglu, the leader of a small ultra-nationalist political party, back from a campaign rally on Wednesday when it crashed. Don't Miss CNN Turk

Former generals accused of plot
Turkish political parties have suspended campaign rallies in the wake of the crash. Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the helicopter crashed, one of the survivors managed to make a cell phone call to an emergency service. Reporter Ismail Gunes pleaded by phone, saying, "I'm starting to freeze. I feel cold. It is snowing. I am inside the helicopter. I guess the people here died. Erhan, brother. Erhan, brother. Nothing. No sound from anyone. So bad." A female dispatcher tells Gunes that the police are trying to locate him. He then calls out again: "Erhan, brother. Brother, try to (open your eyes). He is lying, moaning." Watch the search through snow and ice for helicopter » "Is there any other sound from anyone?" the dispatcher asks. "No, no," Gunes says. "My foot is broken badly. Miss, haven't you located us yet? We will freeze here. I guess the other people are dead. I can't move my foot. It is broken really badly. When will you determine our location, miss?" The crash happened in a mountainous region of eastern Turkey amid rough terrain and adverse weather conditions, officials and media reports said. It also occurred just days before municipal elections across the country.

Baby-pic overload! Social media advice for parents
By Andrea Bartz and Brenna Ehrlich, Special to CNN
updated 5:28 PM EDT, Tue May 8, 2012 | Filed under: Social Media
Yes, your kid is the cutest on the planet. No, your friends don't want to read baby updates every hour.
Editor's note: Brenna Ehrlich and Andrea Bartz are the sarcastic brains behind humor blog and book "Stuff Hipsters Hate." Got a question about etiquette in the digital world? Contact them at netiquette@cnn.com.
(CNN) -- Maternity-leave laws aside, now is a pretty awesome time to be a new parent.
Anyone with the Internet can get advice, connect with other parents and share photos and updates with interested parties in real time. (Think about it: Twenty years ago, it'd be much easier to feel isolated when you were at home all day with a little blinking infant who couldn't do much other than sleep, poop and cry.)
"Reaching out to your social network can help you feel connected to other adults, which can be a saving grace," says Erin Bried, author of "How to Rock Your Baby" (and mother of one of the most adorable children of all time). "That said, there is such a thing as over sharing. Social media is a conversation, and no one likes a person who monopolizes the conversation or brags."
Honestly, there's a lot that can go wrong when you put a proud mama or daddy in front of a keyboard. In our excitement and eagerness to share our offspring with the world, Rafiki-holding-up-Simba-style, we can lose sight of the fact that our children's entire natural lives will be documented online.
That embarrassing footage of your eighth-grade operetta, safely relegated to a decaying VHS in your basement? Nowadays, that kind of thing goes straight from Flip cam to YouTube.
Overly detailed updates your mom used to give your grandma about your action hero du jour? Today, that's a 140-character tweet (with an Instagram photo to boot).
A 2010 study found that 92% of U.S. children have an online presence by the time they're 2. That means modern parents have a responsibility to broadcast their kids' lives in a way that won't make the children hate them a decade later (at least, no more than normal adolescent angst dictates).
With that in mind, here are some tips for garnering more Awww's than Ack's on your social media channels.
Start a mommy (or daddy) blog.
Here's the wonderful thing about blogs: They're empty canvases on which you can go on as long as you want, and only people who type in the URL have to see it. That means they're lovely ways to tell the full story of your Saturday trip to the zoo, during which your 3-year-old decided that he's a penguin and now eats his food by flopping forward onto the table, arms glued to his sides, and nibbling at it with his "beak."
Daily updates of that nature are a bit much on a social media page ("Enough already!") but totally acceptable in blog posts, punctuated with an adorable photo or two. (But not 12.)
Flash the sonogram prudently.
The same 2010 study noted that a third of American children have an online presence when they are still very much unborn. Yes, we get it, there's a little child in that speckled image, and that's worth celebrating. If you're going to put it on Facebook, you're under no obligation to post every. Single. Grainy photo procured.
And we do not condone setting it as your profile photo. It's creepy to glance at your wall and see that a fetus appears to have wished you a happy birthday.
Find a shtick.
Bried gave her Facebook friends a monthly dose of adorable with The Bunny Project, an album that she updated with photos of her growing munchkin posing with the same stuffed animal. The brief instructional video on the topic might actually make your heart swell, Grinch-style.
Point is, giving your baby updates a rubric makes them more fun for your friends to view. "The Bunny Project also gives structure to new parents," she adds, "who may otherwise be tempted to post photos of their adorable baby every hour."
Don't post photos of your adorable baby every hour.
Seriously.
Don't lose your own social media identity in the meantime.
For all our whining, we really do love adorable babies. Everybody does. Whittle it down to the cutest photos and we'll ooh and ahh with abandon. Crop-dust us with weekly albums bursting with almost identical photos of the rug rat on a quilt and we'll start to click away.
Keep us posted on the other things happening in your life: other articles you're reading, things you're doing. Take advantage of the fact that Facebook gives you two profile photos and make the profile shot of you and the cover photo of your brood (or vice versa). Your loved ones might love your kiddie a whole lot, but they've had more time to build a vested interest in your well-being than his or hers.
Don't share anything disgusting.
Nobody wants to know the details of your labor.
Nobody wants to read, see or imagine anything related to your child's bowel movements.
Vomit, urine and solid waste are never, ever acceptable topics of conversation in the public sphere of social media.
Contact your friends and family personally if you need their advice or approval. We. Don't. Want. To. Hear. It.

Get serious about mental health care
By Aaron E. Carroll, Special to CNN
updated 11:37 AM EST, Tue December 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Aaron Carrroll: We might be able to prevent tragedies if we did better job treating mental illness
Carroll says more than 10% of kids should have mental health care, but few get it
He says emergency rooms treat acute instances, but system ill-equipped for long-term treatment
At checkups, he asks parents if guns are in house, but recent laws have tried to stop even this
Editor's note: Aaron E. Carroll is an associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the director of the university's Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research. He blogs about health policy at The Incidental Economist and tweets at @aaronecarroll.
(CNN) -- In the wake of last week's tragedy in Newtown, I have been asked a million questions about gun control. I've seen pictures of the weapon the killer used. I've heard stories about the number of bullets in the clip and the number of guns in his mother's home. I've even heard politicians argue that school officials should be armed with semiautomatic weapons.
I've also heard about mental health.
Aaron E. Carroll
We should be careful not to blame the mentally ill for all crimes. But we should also be prepared to accept that we might be able to prevent some tragedies if we did a better job of caring for them.
I've seen mental health illness in children, and our system is ill-equipped to handle it. I've seen families struggle with it. One of my greatest frustrations with clinical practice is that there are far too many times when I lack the tools necessary to care for children who need help. It's relatively easy to cure an infection or an acute physical ailment. It's so much harder to take a mental health issue. There are rarely pills that will do the job. Even when they are, they almost never work perfectly to eradicate the problem.
Opinion: On gun control, two places to start

Studies show that more than 10% of children in the United States might benefit from some sort of mental health treatment. Most don't get it. We often don't have the research to tell us how best to care for these problems. Even when we do, we often lack the capacity. There is a shortage of resources and services available to serve children. Furthermore, even when those resources exist, a lack of coordination often prevents they're being used effectively.
It doesn't help that the upcoming fiscal cliff will likely cut National Institutes of Health research funding by $2.4 billion. That would mean 2,300 fewer grants in the coming year, which represents about 25% of grants that might otherwise be offered. It doesn't help that we keep talking about cuts to services such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which cover the health care for about one in every three children in the United States.
Gupta: Mental illness for 1 in 5 kids
Community coping with shooting tragedy
How do we stop the violence?
If a child is actively suicidal or homicidal, an emergency room can spring into action and admit him or her for inpatient care. But that's often all inpatient care will do. Once a child is no longer actively threatening harm to himself or others, he or she will be released. That's what the hospital system does. It cares for the acute problem, leaving the long term, and often much harder, work to a system ill-equipped to handle it.
Opinion: Mourn ... and take action on guns
It's natural to try and blame poor parenting when kids don't turn out as well as we'd hope. And, certainly, in many instances such parenting can lead to a misbehaving child, or even a child we don't necessarily like. But mental illness really does exist, and a lot of it can't be cured by good parenting and isn't caused by bad parenting. We don't have a good system for dealing with it.
I want to stress that I don't think that all violence is associated with mental illness. In fact, it's quite the opposite. But the problems with guns and injuries go so far beyond school shootings, and a lot of that is amenable to a more focused health care system.
Opinion: Predicting mass killings impossible
One of the things I do as a pediatrician is "anticipatory guidance." We ask questions about issues that have not yet occurred but might occur in the future. A lot of anticipatory guidance focuses on injury prevention. We might ask about bike helmets, or swimming, or fire alarms in the house. I even ask about guns in the home.
I don't ask this question because I'm eager to lecture patients or parents on the morality of owning guns, or the rights of individuals under the Second Amendment. I'm asking because I'm trying to prevent injury or death. The No. 3 killer of children age 10-14 is suicide; the fourth is homicide. The No. 2 killer of children age 15-19 is homicide; No. 3 is suicide.
Opinion: In school shootings, patterns and warning signs
I have been trained to ask parents if they have a gun in the home. If they do, I ask how it's stored. I strongly recommend that they keep it unloaded, locked up, and that they store the bullets separately. I do this because guns are part of almost 85% of homicides and more than 45% of suicides in kids 5 to 19 years old. This doesn't even account for injuries not resulting in death.
Yet recent laws have attempted to stop pediatricians from doing even this.
I don't know what the best outcome is from a tragedy like this. I imagine much of the focus will be on banning the weapon used or on limiting the number of bullets that could be fired without reloading. I think that's somewhat missing the point. The vast majority of injuries or deaths due to guns are carried out on a small scale.
While what happened in Newtown is a horrific occurrence, it represents the exception, not the norm, with respect to gun violence in the United States. While I welcome the opportunity for us to address the problem, I hope we focus on how we might best help all our children, not just those who make the national news.

Vettel sluggish in Shanghai as Massa sets the pace
updated 10:41 AM EDT, Fri April 12, 2013
Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel has won the world championship in each of the last three seasons.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sebastian Vettel 10th fastest in practice ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix
The Red Bull driver ignored team orders to overtake Mark Webber in Malaysia
Ferrari Felipe Massa sets the fastest time at the Shanghai International Circuit
Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen second fastest
(CNN) -- All eyes were on triple world champion Sebastian Vettel during practice ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix, with the German back behind the wheel for the first time since ignoring team orders to clinch victory in Malaysia.
The Red Bull driver was left frustrated at the Shanghai International Circuit, struggling for pace as he registered the 10th quickest lap time.
World championship leader Vettel was one and a half seconds off the leading time set by Ferrari's Felipe Massa and insisted improvements were needed ahead of qualifying on Saturday.
Read: Fast track to driver road rage?
"Today was a tricky day for us," the 25-year-old told the sport's official website. "I struggled a bit this afternoon and the gap to the guys at the top is a little bit bigger than I'd like.
"Get him (Webber) out of the way, he is too slow," Sebastian Vettel disdainfully remarked over team radio at last month's Malaysia Grand Prix. The German was instructed not to challenge Webber, who was leading the race, but ignored orders and overtook the Australian with ten laps remaining. Vettel's tactics caused much consternation on social media and reopened the debate about the practicality of team orders in Formula 1. Vettel leads Webber during the Malaysia Grand Prix in Sepang in March. It's not the first time team orders have caused rifts between drivers. Awkward scenes on the podium at the 2010 German Grand Prix after Felipe Massa (left) surrendered the lead to his Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso when the team told him that the Spaniard had the faster car.
Rubens Barrichello (right) looks far from content as teammate Michael Schumacher has a quiet word on the podium following the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, which the German controversially won. The Brazilian, who spent six years as Schumacher's deputy at Ferrari, says he empathizes with Webber's position at Red Bull. Barrichello led the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix before ceding position to his Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher. Team orders were banned the following season.
"El Maestro" Juan Manuel Fangio (left) and Stirling Moss engaged in discussion following the 1957 Italian grand Prix at Monza, which the Englishman won. The pair were teammates at Mercedes in 1955. "The team has always been the most important thing," says Moss. "Once you're with a company you really have to do what they tell you to. It's a professional business with very big money, which it wasn't (when I drove). Drivers are being paid like film stars now."
Moss (left) trails behind Fangio at the Italian Grand Prix in 1956. "I'm glad I raced when I did and not now because the pleasure was so much more then and the racing certainly was purer," Moss says.

Team orders: needless or necessary?
An unhappy Mark Webber, left, with Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel at the postrace press conference in Malaysia. Webber had led after coming out of his final pit stop with 13 laps to go in Sepang, but Vettel claimed victory after defying team orders to overtake while the Australian was following instructions to conserve his car.
They shared the podium with third-placed Lewis Hamilton, whose Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg obeyed team orders and did not attack the English driver even though he felt he was quicker.
Fernando Alonso won the race last year, but his 200th career grand prix was less successful. The Ferrari driver damaged his front wing early on and then made the mistake of staying out on the track too long and was not able to finish.
Jenson Button's car is pushed back to the pit area after his crew let the McLaren leave with a loose front wheel. It ruined the 2009 world champion's chances of earning points and he retired before the end of the race. However, his new Mexican teammate Sergio Perez finished ninth.

"There are two or three things that we need to work on and then we should be in a better shape for tomorrow.
"I think we know what we need to do. It looks like the soft tyre is the one for qualifying, but it seems that we won't see that many stints on the soft tyre during the race."
Webber, who was upset by Vettel's decision to overtake him last month despite being instructed by Red Bull to hold position, performed better than his colleague, clocking the fifth fastest time of the day.

For Massa it continues a bright start to 2013 which has seen him outperform his double world champion teammate Fernando Alonso.
"Today, I immediately had a good feeling in the car," explained Brazil's Massa, who is four points ahead of Alonso in fifth position in the drivers' standings.
"I feel confident and hope that the whole weekend can keep moving in this direction."
Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen, winner of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix set the second fastest time.
The 2007 world champion was satisfied with the performance of his Renault car and is optimistic ahead of the weekend.
"If you look at the lap time it looks to have been a pretty okay day," said the Finn. "For sure, there are things we have to improve and you never know what will happen tomorrow, but it's a reasonable start to the weekend.
"We can definitely improve. We have some pace to come from the car in the usual areas with setup.
"My quick lap today could have been better, so there's some more pace to come even if we don't improve the car, but hopefully we do."

The right way for conservatives to win
By David Frum, CNN Contributor
updated 9:07 AM EDT, Mon October 28, 2013
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, here with President Obama in 2011, has achieved remarkable things, David Frum says.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Frum: Stephen Harper shows path U.S. conservatives should follow
He says Canadian prime minister avoids "Braveheart" speeches, bold policy shifts
Canada has emerged strongly from world economic crisis, Frum writes
Frum: By contrast, U.S. conservatives have appalled and frightened Americans
Editor's note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, "Patriots," and a post-election e-book, "Why Romney Lost." Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002.
(CNN) -- U.S. conservatives deeply admire Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In a March story, National Review hailed Harper as the new "leader of the West" -- and they didn't mean Western Canada. The Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard have added their own praise.
Well they might. Harper has achieved more from a weaker position than any conservative leader of recent times.
A decade ago, Canada's Conservatives were split between two antagonistic parties. Harper won the leadership of one of those parties, then negotiated a merger, with himself as leader of the united right. He then had to fight a rapid series of elections: In 2004 he reduced the once-dominant Liberals to minority status. In 2006, he won just barely enough seats to form a minority government himself. He won a stronger minority in 2008, but only in 2011 did he at last gain the secure majority he'd sought for a decade.
Under desperately precarious political circumstances -- and in the face of the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s -- Harper achieved remarkable things.
David Frum
Almost 1 million more Canadians are working today than before the financial crisis -- the best employment record in the Group of 7.
Incomes have recovered and surpassed pre-recession peaks.
Canada's national debt burden is lower than that of any other major economy -- and less than half that of the United States. Corporate tax rates are lower in Canada than in the United States, and on the present trajectory the same may soon be true of personal income taxes as well.
How did Harper and his Conservatives do it?
Not the way that American conservatives are trying to do it. American conservatives have followed a radical path to repeated defeat. Canadian conservatives have followed an incremental path to accumulating success.
American conservatives have followed a radical path to repeated defeat. (Canadians) have followed an incremental path to accumulating success. David Frum
Americans then might benefit as much as Canadians from reading "The Longer I'm Prime Minister," a lively new book about the secrets of Harper's survival and success, written by one of Canada's leading political columnists, Paul Wells of Maclean's magazine. The title plays off a joke Harper frequently tells on himself: "The longer I'm prime minister" -- pause for dramatic effect -- "the longer I'm prime minister."
It's a joke based on a grim political reality: Twenty-one men and one woman have served as prime minister of Canada. Six of them have lasted less than a year. Three more lasted less than three years. On the other hand, five prime ministers served more than 10 years. If the 54-year-old Harper completes his current term, he will have served for nine years. One more win after that, and he will have joined the champions.
"My models aren't Conservative prime ministers," Wells quotes Harper. "My models are successful prime ministers."
Wells is not especially sympathetic to Harper's politics or purposes. But he has invested the close attention necessary to understand them. As Wells explains, Harper's first priority is to last. As Harper himself said in a 2004 speech that outlined his political program before a friendly audience, incremental gains are "inevitably" the only real ones. Revolutionary projects almost always fail.
"The surest rebuttal Harper can offer to a half-century of Liberal hegemony," Wells points out, "is not to race around doing things the next Liberal could undo." The better rebuttal, instead, is to build a counter-hegemony of one's own. What could be more foolish than futile provocative actions that serve only to consolidate the other guy's advantages? American conservatives enamored of their bold programs may disdain Harper's caution. Think again.
"Because he is temperamentally the most conservative Canadian prime minister of his lifetime, he will not ever run out of ideas for conservative things to do. So on any day he has a choice, he can do the big conservative thing that would be the end of his career, or he can do some of the small conservative things that won't. He is amazed that earlier leaders had a hard time choosing."
As Wells points out, however, a politician can accomplish a lot by the simple act of refraining from committing career suicide.
"How many decisions does a prime minister make in a day? Sixty? A hundred? Almost none go reported. He doesn't even have to keep most of them secret: the rush of events ensures they won't be noticed and assayed by the (press) gallery. As the 2011 election approached, Harper was approaching two thousand days in office. Imagine how different the outcome would have been if a different prime minister, with different assumptions, prejudices, and instincts had made those thousands of decisions."
Many U.S. Republicans argue that elections are won by boldly standing on principle. Sen. Ted Cruz articulated just that idea in his speech Friday to Iowa's Ronald Reagan Dinner. He lauded the House Republicans who nearly pushed the nation into bankruptcy as "a profile in courage who stood strong and listened to the American people." In fact, of course, those House Republicans appalled and frightened the American people -- and badly damaged themselves in the process.
After the worst miscalculation of his own career -- a failed maneuver that nearly brought down his government in 2008 -- Harper explained the lesson he'd learned: Never surprise the voters. Do not outpace the consent they have granted. Lead from the front -- but never from very far in front.
As for those bold "Braveheart" speeches so cherished by conservatives these days ... they are to be avoided at all costs. Wells observes the Harper speechmaking operation close up: "He works at removing memorable turns of phrase and identifiable ideas from his speeches. He puts great effort into flattening his prose." Why? "All that stuff that sounds good in speeches -- 'We must,' 'I will never,' 'Mark my words' -- all that becomes a line in the sand. It gets held against you later. So that stuff's coming out."
I know Harper a little, and I can attest: It requires immense self-control to keep this relentlessly interesting intellect sounding dull. But politics is not a business for the self-indulgent. "Observers looking for something to dislike get less fodder than they would if he were a loudmouth."
As I write, the Harper government is facing a moment of controversy. Harper appointees to the unelected upper chamber of the Canadian Parliament are accused of cheating on their expenses, and the opposition parties are making a familiar uproar over the familiar questions of what did the prime minister know and when did he know it. It's all very exciting, and likely all very fleeting. What is lasting is governance. American conservatives should rediscover it -- and Wells' entertaining and insightful study of North America's most governance-minded conservative offers an excellent place to start.

Tears of joy for Jason Day as he completes emotional World Cup win updated 11:24 AM EST, Sun November 24, 2013
Jason Day's victory proved popular with home fans at Royal Melbourne as he led Australia to the team title at the World Cup. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jason Day wins World Cup of Golf in Melbourne
Edges Thomas Bjorn of Denmark by two strokes
Leads Australia to team title with Adam Scott
Filipino-Australian Day lost eight relatives to Typhoon Haiyan
(CNN) -- Jason Day nearly pulled out of the World Cup of Golf after learning he had lost eight relatives to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.
Instead he completed an emotional double victory Sunday in Melbourne as he claimed the individual title and paired with Adam Scott to lead Australia to team honors.
After finishing with a final round 70 for 10-under at Royal Melbourne, Day said his Filipino mother Dening and his sisters had been in this thoughts throughout the event.
They were in the gallery to watch the 24-year-old hold off Thomas Bjorn of Denmark by two shots in a tense final round.
"I am just happy that she is here and I get to hug her," he said.
It would have been the easiest thing for me to just go ahead and pull out of the tournament with what has been going on over the last weekJason Day
Read: Death toll rises from Typhoon Haiyan "It would have been the easiest thing for me to just go ahead and pull out of the tournament with what has been going on over the last week, just to be up there with my mum and support her," he added.
Day lost his grandmother, an uncle and six cousins in the November 8 tragedy and he said that both he and World No.2 Scott would assist with the relief program.
"We will definitely be giving some money or raising money and trying to raise awareness to what has really happened over there.
"To have that lead going into Sunday with all that stuff going on, to finally finish off and hit a great shot into 18 like I did and to win like that was a very big move in my golfing career."
Scott, who has won the Australia PGA and Australia Masters title in the past month, continued his superb form by taking third in the individual standings.
Their combined score left them 10 shots clear of the United States in the team category, Australia's first success for 24 years in the annual competition.
Read: Golfer gets hole in one at World Cup
Bjorn, who led after two rounds and trailed Day by just one shot heading into the last day, paid tribute to the winner.
"I couldn't be happier for Jason. He has gone through a rough time of late and for him to even be here is a big thing and then to go and go and win the golf tournament, and for him to also win the team event, is fantastic," he said.
Scott will head to the Australian Open in Sydney this week, bidding a triple of the three main tournaments held in his country, only the second man in history to achieve the feat if he does emerge the winner.
Day will also be competing at Royal Sydney.
