Gertrude Baines, world's oldest person, dies at 115Story Highlights Gertrude Baines dies at age 115, was world's oldest person Baines credited longevity to God, not drinking or smoking Baines was oldest African-American to vote for President Obama Next Article in U.S. » LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Gertrude Baines, the world's oldest person, has died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 115, according to the home where she lived and Guinness World Records said Saturday. Gertrude Baines said she attributed her longevity to not drinking or smoking. Gertrude Baines passed away at the Western Convalescent Hospital at 7:25 a.m. (10:25 a.m. ET) Friday, Guinness World Records said. Born in 1894, Baines became the world's oldest person in January after the death of another 115-year-old, Maria de Jesus, from Portugal, Guinness World Records said. At her 115th birthday party in April, Baines shook her head in disbelief when presented with the certificate saying she was now in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest person. "She told me that she owes her longevity to the Lord, that she never did drink, never did smoke, and she never did fool around," her doctor, Dr. Charles Witt, said in April. Baines, whose grandparents were slaves, worked as a maid in Ohio State University dormitories until her retirement, and lived at the Los Angeles convalescent home for more than 10 years. Last November, she became the oldest African-American to vote for President Obama and received a letter from him on her 115th birthday, Guinness World Records said. Witt said Baines planned to vote for Obama again in 2012. Asked why she voted for Obama, Baines said it was because "he's for the colored people," according to footage from The Los Angeles Times. She said she never thought a black man could become president. "Everybody's glad for a colored man to be in there sometime," Baines said. "We all are the same on the skin. It's dark, and theirs is white." Baines had few complaints, her doctor said. She fussed about the bacon not being crisp enough and the arthritis in her knees, Witt said. The smooth skin on Baines' face belied her 115 years, but she didn't attribute that to any anti-wrinkle cream or miracle product, according to her best friend, Lucille Fayall. She said Baines simply washed her face in cold water.

'Contagion' tops weak weekend box office By John Young, EW.com
updated 11:02 AM EDT, Mon September 12, 2011
"Contagion" features an Oscar-endorsed cast including Matt Damon and Kate Winslet.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Contagion" garnered positive reviews, but got a mediocre "B-" rating from moviegoers
"Warrior" skewed a bit older than one would expect for a picture about mixed martial arts
Each showing of "Creature" drew an average audience of two moviegoers
(EW.com) -- It was not a pretty weekend at the box office.
According to studio estimates, this was the lowest-grossing weekend of the year, with the top 10 movies collectively earning just $66.4 million. Only one of four new wide releases, the Warner Bros. thriller "Contagion", opened to encouraging numbers.
The Steven Soderbergh film, about the outbreak of a deadly virus, swabbed a solid $23.1 million, with $2.3 million coming from IMAX theaters. The PG-13 movie, which featured an Oscar-endorsed cast including Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, and Gwyneth Paltrow, drew an adult crowd -- 81 percent of the audience was at least 25 years old. Made for about $60 million, "Contagion" garnered positive reviews from critics, but settled for a mediocre "B-" rating from CinemaScore moviegoers.
In second place, "The Help" suffered its biggest drop (a still very respectable 41 percent) to earn $8.7 million. Before this weekend, the drama had spent 25 straight days at No. 1 -- the longest daily streak since 1999′s "The Sixth Sense." The Kathryn Stockett adaptation, which was produced for just $25 million, has so far grossed an outstanding $137.1 million.
The mixed martial arts drama "Warrior" debuted in third to an underwhelming $5.6 million. According to Lionsgate, 66 percent of the audience consisted of, unsurprisingly, men. Of greater interest is whether the PG-13 film managed to attract young men. The studio says 51 percent of the movie's audience was at least 25 years old, while CinemaScore places that figure at 70 percent. Either way, "Warrior" skewed a bit older than one would expect for a picture about mixed martial arts. That may be because Lionsgate marketed the $25 million movie as more of a prestige film than an action-packed sports flick.
The good news is that the critically acclaimed film picked up an "A" rating from CinemaScore participants. If favorable word of mouth spreads and "Warrior" manages to hold up well the next few weeks, it could turn itself into something of a sleeper hit.
Those last two words won't be used to describe the week's other two new releases. The Adam Sandler-produced comedy "Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star" opened in 15th place to a pitiful $1.5 million at 1,500 theaters. (Apparently the movie really likes the number 15.) Those who did attend Sony's $10 million R-rated film, starring Nick Swardson as an aspiring porn actor, were mostly young men -- 65 percent of the audience was male and 64 percent was under the age of 25.
But the half-man, half-alligator monster flick "Creature", made by the indie production company The Bubble Factory, dropped the box-office bar to historic lows. The small-budget R-rated film, which was inexplicably released in 1,507 theaters, debuted to a microscopic $331,000. That represents a per-location average of $220. Let's say the movie screened an average of five times a day at each theater, and that tickets cost $8. Under those circumstances, each showing of "Creature" drew an average audience of two moviegoers.
"Creature" also set the worst opening ever for a film playing in at least 1,500 theaters, beating Delgo's $512,000 debut. The title character of that 2008 animated flop was also some sort of humanoid reptile. Hey, Michael Bay, you sure you want to produce that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot?
Among holdovers, the spy thriller "The Debt" fell 51 percent for $4.9 million, and the revenge action film "Colombiana" dipped 46 percent for $4 million. And in limited release, "Laugh at My Pain", the theatrical version of Kevin Hart's stand-up comedy tour, debuted to $2 million at 97 locations for a stellar per-theater gross of $20,619.
1. Contagion -- $23.1 mil
2. The Help -- $8.7 mil
3. Warrior -- $5.6 mil
4. The Debt -- $4.9 mil
5. Colombiana -- $4.0 mil

Stay-at-home moms turning into WAHMs By Charlotte Latvala, Parenting.com Forget everything you've heard about stay-at-home moms. Many are starting businesses and working from home. STORY HIGHLIGHTSLife as a stay-at-home-mom comes with rewards and challenges Moms share stories and tips about single parenting, adoption and home schooling via blogs48% of at-home moms consider being home full time the ideal situationJust because you're at home doesn't mean your life has to be all baby, all the time

Culture and Lifestyle
(Parenting.com) -- In my pre-kid life, I never imagined that someday I'd be a stay-at-home mom -- hey, I didn't go to grad school to spend my days changing diapers. But when I held my first baby, Mathilda, I had a complete change of heart. As soon as we locked eyes, all those career and financial worries faded. They didn't disappear, but they certainly became secondary. I have tons of friends with similar experiences. They're not clones -- today's stay-at-home mom (SAHM) may be a tattooed rock singer, the CEO of her own company or a green-living activist -- but they all have something in common: a deep desire to be there for every moment of their babies' lives -- the good, the bad and the unbelievably messy. If you're considering life as a SAHM, both sweet rewards and tough challenges await. Today's at-home mom is launching an at-home business There are 10.1 million women-owned businesses in the United States, says the Center for Women's Business Research. No firm statistics exist on how many are run by stay-at-home moms, but it stands to reason that the percentage is increasing in the Wi-Fi age. "Over 90 percent of the moms we've interviewed said the desire for family flexibility is the number-one reason they work from home," says Ellen Parlapiano, co-founder of mompreneursonline.com. "Another big change we've seen in the past 15 years is acceptance. In the past, moms have been reluctant to tell clients they work from home. Now it's commonplace, even respectable." Mom-owned businesses, which used to be heavy on arts and crafts, now run the professional gamut, says Parlapiano: Web design, attorney, marketing guru, social media coaching, you name it. Blogging about her life -- and reaching others Plug "mom bloggers" into a search engine and you'll come up with thousands of SAHMs who chronicle their daily lives online. Moms share stories and tips about single parenting, adoption, home schooling and more. The most popular blogs, like the Pioneer Woman and Dooce, turned their authors into celebrities who rack up book and movie deals. Jen Singer, the New Jersey mom of two who created mommasaid.net, says her blog averages 90,000 views per month; it's not a huge moneymaker per se, but it has led to book deals, speaking engagements and endorsement offers -- none of which would have happened in the pre-Internet era. "Mom bloggers are hugely influential because they represent the authentic voices of other moms," says Jennifer James, founder of mombloggersclub.com, a community that's 10,000 strong. Making a living from a blog is tough, she adds, but there are other perks. "Moms who pen really great blogs are heavily courted by brands to review their product," she says. "Some receive thousands of dollars in products each month." Parenting.com: 31 reasons you shouldn't feel mom guilt Unapologetic about her choices A 2007 Pew Research Center survey shows that more at-home moms today (48 percent) consider being home full time the ideal situation than they did 10 years ago (39 percent). Inversely, just 21 percent of working moms say working full time is ideal, down from 32 percent in 1997. "In my research, there seems to be a backlash among the millennial generation; in a sense, they're modeling themselves after their grandmothers, not their mothers," says Susan Shapiro Barash, a women's issues expert and author of "You're Grounded Forever...But First, Let's Go Shopping: The Challenges Mothers Face With Their Daughters and Ten Timely Solutions." Many of these young women look at their baby boomer moms and question why they'd want to be them. Some of those moms struggled in their marriages and had a tough time balancing work and family, she says. That doesn't mean today's SAHM has abandoned her career aspirations or traded her BlackBerry for an ironing board, just that she's more concerned about living a balanced life than proving she's Superwoman. WAHM: The best of both worlds When I first started working from home 15 years ago, I had never heard the acronym WAHM (work-at-home mom). The landscape has certainly changed; now, instead of "Work versus staying home?" the question for moms-to-be is often "What work can I do from home?" Brooke Hall, who runs a Web design business (brookehalldesign.com) and stays home with her 10-month-old son, Owen, is happy doing both. "I get to be here for the first giggle and step, and yet working from home gives me an identity other than 'mom,'" says the 27-year-old from Dublin, California. "I'm still the same person I was before the baby -- partly due to my continuing professional life." It can be a crazy juggling act on some days, but most WAHMs say the multitasking is worth it. "The best part of the work/kid combination is that I'm not lost and drowning in diapers and plastic building blocks," says Amy McAllister, 23, of Elk Grove, California, who teaches others how to bake and decorate cakes at littleladycakes.com and is studying to be a licensed acupuncturist. "I feel strong as an individual, which makes me a better mother and an even better role model to my 2-year-old son." Parenting.com: Completely ridiculous parenting products To be a successful WAHM, you need: • The right attitude Working at home is still work, there's just not someone else telling you what to do and when to do it. The key to success is being self-motivated to haul youself out of bed at dawn and get cracking before the baby wakes up -- or stay up past baby's bedtime, when you're likely tired too. • A plan Crossing your fingers and winging it is not enough. "Even before I had kids, I chose a profession that would allow me to stay home and raise children while working on the side," says Melissa Leonard, 37, a New York City etiquette consultant. "I've made it work by taking jobs when it's convenient for me -- mostly on weekends when my husband can be at home with our baby." • A support system Since my husband, Tony, works nights, he was often able to take the babies when I had phone interviews or pressing deadlines. I've also done swaps with other moms, hired baby sitters to fill in during crunch times and kept a stash of exciting new toys to pull out when necessary. (A crinkly orange caterpillar once bought me about 15 minutes of quiet time.) • A realistic schedule Nap time is almost always work time for WAHMs. "I'd almost hyperventilate running to the computer as soon as I got the kids down -- I knew the time would be short, and so I had to make the most of it," says Shelley Hunter, 44, who runs a gift card website (giftcardgirlfriend.com) from her Danville, California, home. • Your own space Even if it's a tiny corner of your dining room, you need a physical space devoted to work. "I turned a spare bedroom into my office, and it's set up just like any professional space would be," says Angela Halloran, 35, a web designer (boutiquewebdesigns.com) who lives in Noblesville, Indiana. "At the end of each work day, I close the office door and don't open it again until the next morning." Parenting.com: Quirky discipline tricks that actually work Beyond first smiles and steps: What at-home moms love • Lots and lots of flexibility "As a stay-at-home mom, I have a lot more leeway in my schedule when things go wrong," says Hunter. "When one of my babies got sick, I didn't have to call off work or find someone to watch him." You can also run errands during nonpeak hours -- hitting the grocery store, the bank and the gym at 10 a.m. versus the 5:30 p.m. rush or scheduling doctor appointments and haircuts when it's most convenient for you, not your supervisor. • Having a well-rounded life Being an at-home mom allowed me to take advantage of opportunities that would have been difficult in the 9-to-5 world. If I wanted to have coffee with a nearby mom friend, for instance, we broke out the strollers and went. If I decided to volunteer at a church luncheon, I strapped Mathilda into her BabyBjörn and pitched in. If I felt like taking the baby to the park for an afternoon and playing peekaboo in the grass, I didn't have to clear it with anyone. • Direct-access breastfeeding At-home moms don't have to worry about toting the industrial-strength breast pump to the office or pumping in the bathroom. "Because I was home with my second baby, I was able to nurse him longer," says Stephanie Burchett, 30, of Pittsburgh. "My older son had asthma, allergies and a ton of ear infections as a baby, but the second one has no major health issues so far -- I'm sure breastfeeding longer and being home helped." • Siestas "Napping during the day was a huge benefit for me, especially after a wakeful night with the baby," says Sonya Braun, 37, a Winnipeg, Manitoba, mom of three. "Losing a lot of sleep at night takes its toll quickly!" • Time to smell the coffee (or read "Goodnight Moon" 20 times a day) "If moms allow themselves to be 'in the moment' with their babies, they find such raw happiness it is priceless," says Darla Shine, author of "Happy Housewives" and mom of two. "I would give anything to have one hour in the rocking chair nursing my newborns again." The infant stage flies by in a flash, she adds -- being at home allows you to savor every day.

Dutch teens charged in linesman's death
updated 5:43 PM EST, Tue December 4, 2012

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Three Dutch teenagers charged with manslaughter following death of a soccer official
Assistant referee Richard Nieuwenhuizen was beaten up by three teen players
He had been officiating during an amateur game involving his club Buitenboys
The trio were arrested at their Amsterdam home on Sunday, according to reports
(CNN) -- The Netherlands is reeling from the death of a volunteer soccer official at an amateur football match over the weekend which has led to three Dutch teenagers being charged with manslaughter.
Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old -- all Amsterdam club Nieuw Sloten players -- were arrested and charged by Dutch police after the death of a 41-year-old linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen, who was beaten by players following a match against his club Buitenboys in the city of Almere.
Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing in the match when the incident occurred.
"Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old from Amsterdam, under suspicion of seriously assaulting a 41-year-old linesman of the Buitenboys from Almere, will on Thursday appear before a judge at the Almere court," the prosecutor's office said.
"The suspects will appear on charges of manslaughter, assault and public violence."
The judge will now decide whether to keep the three youths in detention in Amsterdam.
Nieuwenhuizen is the second man to die during an amateur football game following the death of a 77-year-old, who was the victim of a karate kick by a 32-year-old footballer during a game on December 3 2011.
At a press conference, Bernard Fransen, president of KNVB amateur football, said he was "very shocked" by the tragic incident.
"Amateur football matches will be canceled this weekend and a minute's silence will be observed during professional football matches," he told reporters.
Nieuwenhuizen's death has resonated across the globe with FIFA president Sepp Blatter extending his condolences.
"Football is a mirror of society and sadly, the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game," said Blatter, according to a statement on fifa.com.
"Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs."
On its website Nieuw Sloten said it was "deeply shocked" by Nieuwenhuizen's death, adding that it would ban for life the players found to be responsible, as well pulling its team from the league and temporarily suspending all operations as a club.
"Violence should not be on the football fields," said a statement on the Nieuw Sloten website.
"And certainly not against referees, linesmen and all those others who volunteer each year to help over a million amateur footballers. We must do everything possible to eliminate these excesses.
Nieuwenhuizen was pronounced dead at 5.30 p.m. local time on Monday in the hospital of Nieuwegein, according to his club Buitenboys.
"Buitenboys wish the family much strength with this loss," said the Buitenboys website.
"The Dutch Football Association is deeply shocked. After intervention of the police and the arrival of an ambulance, he was in critical condition and transported to a hospital. There he died Monday afternoon," reported the website of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). The KNVB's director of amateur football, Anton Binnenmars, added: "Let me, on behalf of the entire KNVB and all its members, offer my sympathy to the families and friends of the victim. It is outrageous that someone enjoying a hobby can be victim of such aggression."
Despite a population of 17.5 million, Holland has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years, with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country's professional clubs.
All amateur football has been cancelled this weekend in Holland.

From pope to politician, when do you know it's time to go?
By Jill Martin Wrenn, CNN
updated 10:17 AM EST, Thu February 14, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Benedict XVI is the first pope to retire in nearly 600 years; he says age is a factor
Former New York Gov. George Pataki retired after three terms and didn't seek a fourth
Pataki: "I was never going to let my public title become my personal identity"
Experts say succession plans are key to smooth transitions and a positive legacy
(CNN) -- Choosing to step down from a top job can be an extraordinary decision, whether the person is a pontiff or a politician. But George Pataki, former governor of New York, says making the switch from public figure to John Q. Public wasn't difficult for him.
"I made up my mind that I was never going to let my public title become my personal identity," he says. He embraced what he calls a sense of normalcy after he left office, going to movies and basketball games.
A year or two after he left office, Pataki went to Madison Square Garden with a group of friends to see the Knicks play. And he wanted to stand in line to get himself a hot dog -- something elected officials tend not to do.
"I loved it," he says. Even though fellow fans recognized him and offered to let him jump the queue, Pataki waited in line for his hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut. "I felt really good about the fact that it was just comfortable for me to be on line with the rest," he says.
Pope's brother: Aging process is hard
Pope resigning: What it means
Pataki decided in the middle of his third term in office that he would not seek a fourth term. He left office in 2006, after 12 years as governor.
Pope's resignation a new angle to a tough news beat
"I had no doubts that this was the right decision for me, for my family, for the team that had worked so hard with me, and for the state," he says.
Pataki now practices law at Chadbourne & Parke in New York, where he focuses on energy and environmental issues. He has enjoyed his return to the private sector. "The transition for me was really not that difficult, to be perfectly honest," says Pataki. "But it was time."
Deciding when it's time to leave can be tough, especially when top jobs are hard to find. In the corporate world, stepping down from a leadership role by choice is uncommon.
"It's almost unheard of," says Patricia Cook, CEO of the executive search firm Cook & Company. "It's a very unusual event."

Experts in the business world wonder why an executive would relinquish a leadership role. Cook says she can't think of an instance when a CEO stepped down because he or she didn't feel up to the job. But health concerns can change the game.
Pope Benedict XVI surprised the world Monday when he announced he would resign at the end of this month. He cited his age and his deteriorating strength in his statement: "I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry." A Vatican spokesman said on Tuesday that Benedict is not suffering from a specific ailment.
"I was very surprised," says David Perry, associate professor of history at Dominican University. Even so, Perry knew resignation was possible -- even for a pope. "From my perspective as a medievalist, it's not surprising that popes can resign," he says. Papal law makes clear that pontiffs can give up their roles.
But that hasn't happened in nearly 600 years. Whatever Benedict's motivation for choosing to step down now, experts say that his legacy could depend on whether there will be an orderly succession.
Career expert Nicole Williams stresses the importance of a clean exit in the corporate arena. "Departing is what ends up being a very monumental and usually public occasion," she says.
Regardless of an employee's years of loyalty and service, the final stretch is often what defines the person. "What they remember is you leaving," says Williams. "You're going to want to be remembered by this departure, so you want to control it versus it controlling you."
Geoff Hoffmann took over as chief executive officer of the search firm DHR International from his father. As someone who recently went through the transition process, and who advises companies on their plans, he says a leadership plan is the key to success.
Opinion: Echoes of past in pope's resignation
"One of the most important duties of a CEO is to make sure that the succession plan is in place, really from Day One," he says. "Some of the best-run companies are really thoughtful with their succession planning."
Health and circumstance can contribute to a person's decision to step down from a job in any field.
If a leader doesn't feel up to the task, experts say retirement makes sense. "If we look at the corporate world, it really is about: Can the CEO execute the job at the level it needs to be done?" says Susan Battley, founder and CEO of Battley Performance Consulting.
From mental sharpness to memory, leaders need finely tuned skills to be at the top of their game. "Effective leadership is all about being able to execute brilliantly," says Battley. Whether the person is in charge of a Fortune 500 company, or the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, leadership is exhausting.
Since leaving office, Pataki and his wife spend as much time as they can at their farm in the Adirondack Mountains. He's still playing sports, like basketball, and watching them; he calls himself a long-suffering Jets fan. And he still appears on the political stage. He says: "I do want to try to help out with advancing policies that are right for the future of the country."
As for the pope, a Vatican spokesman says he will likely retire to a monastery, where he will spend his time focused on prayer and reflection.

Murder trial jurors can be overwhelmed, traumatized
By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
updated 11:06 AM EDT, Sat July 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some jurors report symptoms reminiscent of PTSD, such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts
In the Casey Anthony trial, the jury was sequestered
Jurors should take care of themselves and seek counseling after the trial if needed
Editor's note: A six-woman jury will decide the fate of George Zimmerman, accused in the death of Trayvon Martin. CNN Health is republishing this piece about the mental stress of participating in a murder trial jury. It was written when jurors were in deliberations in the Casey Anthony trial in 2011. She was acquitted of a murder charge in the death of her daughter.
(CNN) -- Paula Calzetta was driving to dinner with Diane Keim last month when she made a wrong turn that put the women in front of a Bank of America building in Cheshire, Connecticut.
Keim nearly threw up. In a flash, Calzetta remembered everything she'd learned about the brutal murders connected to that place. They had been jurors in the trial of a man who, after extorting money from a woman there, killed her and her children. The former jurors ended up at that bank on the way to meet the deceased woman's family for the first time.
"They were worried that we had to go through what they went through," said Calzetta, 56. "They were very thankful, and sorry that we had to go through all of that, but certainly we would have all done it again."
Jurors begin deliberations in Zimmerman trial
At that bank, in July 2007, Steven Hayes had forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to withdraw $15,000, according to police, while her family was being held hostage at her home. Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were charged with killing Hawke-Petit and her two young daughters. The children's father, prominent endocrinologist William Petit, was tied up and severely beaten but escaped. Hayes was convicted and sentenced to death; Komisarjevsky's trial is still to come.

Serving on a jury for a murder trial such as that of Hayes, or of Casey Anthony, who is charged with seven counts in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, can be emotionally and physically taxing. And after a trial is over, some jurors report symptoms reminiscent of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as flashbacks and intrusive thoughts.
Whether you're in the courtroom or at home watching TV, repeated exposure to the details of a horrific events can lead to a phenomenon called vicarious traumatization -- you're so connected to a tragedy that you feel emotional trauma as if you'd been directly involved.
"To see the images that they're seeing of this is overwhelming," Nadine Kaslow, a psychologist at Emory University, said of the Anthony trial jurors. "Everyone's going to have a reason to be impacted by this case. Whether or not you have children of your own, there's no way out of being profoundly influenced."
Jury service is especially difficult because jurors can't share their thoughts about the case or the experience with anyone until after the trial, said Sonia Chopra, a consultant for the National Jury Project in Oakland, California.
"One of the best ways to alleviate stress and anxiety is to talk it through with somebody else," she said. "While the jurors are in trial, that's problematic, because they're not technically supposed to talk about anything that happens in the courtroom with anyone. For the length of the trial, they're having to just internalize everything that they're hearing and they're seeing."
In the Anthony trial, jurors are sequestered, meaning they are barred from any contact with anyone outside the courtroom, and cannot read or watch news of any kind. When confined to interacting among themselves, jurors sometimes form a support system, Kaslow said.
"To cope, to survive, actually, you form these new families. It's a very good survival technique," she said. "The problem is, when you start getting things like hung juries, and all the challenges around that, you can end up in a very problematic situation."
The Hayes trial jurors were not sequestered, meaning they could go home at the end of the day and be with their families. Calzetta takes care of her 90-year-old father and probably wouldn't have been able to join a sequestered jury; but in a way, isolation might have been better, she said.
"In some ways, it might be easier because of the pressure from everyone on the outside that they know you're on the jury. They really want to ask you [about it]," Calzetta said.
Calzetta thought she would approach the trial with an open mind: She would sit and analyze. She had no idea how much it had affected her until a break in the trial before the sentencing phase. She developed a fever and was sick during the entire time off.
Going into the next stage of the trial, she had a new strategy: Pay attention to her own needs, too. She had massages, took steam baths and relaxed in other ways.
"You really do have to take care of yourself, because it's real. All this stuff, once you take it into your consciousness, it's real," she said.
Even though they got to return to their normal lives at the end of each day, Calzetta felt her group of jurors became a family, too, during the nearly two months of the trial.
"After everything was over, I felt almost, like, a loss. They were my everything for those months," she said.
Keim, 59, had already been through breast cancer when she was selected for the Hayes trial. She believes her near-death illness and her age made her emotionally stronger as a juror than she would have been in her younger years.
But the stories and images stayed with her after the trial. She began to have dreams that the Petit daughters were alive and that she took care of them as if they were her own children.
And when she returned to her job as a teacher, about a month after the trial ended, she sometimes saw a flashback of the Petit girls' picture in her fifth-grade classroom.
"Just thinking about what it was like right before they set the fire. ... This happens periodically, I see this image of the girls being burned," she said. "Something that I see will trigger the memory of the trial and the pictures."
And when it comes to a tragic case such as this or Casey Anthony's, with a lengthy trial, it's important to seek help when you need it afterward, Kaslow said.
"I think that these jurors need to be very aware that when you get off a case like this, you may need some counseling. This is going to bring up different things for different people, depending on your life story," she said.
When the Hayes trial was over, jurors had a debriefing with counselors. Some sought counseling afterward, Calzetta said. And some, including Calzetta and Keim, have remained friends.
"When we get together, we don't need to talk about it. We all just understand," she said.
The trial of Joshua Komisarjevsky, the other man accused of participating in the murders of Hawke-Petit and her children, is scheduled for September. The lead-up to it brings back more memories for Calzetta, but she still plans to attend at least part of the trial because she feels that she needs to hear that side of the story.
To this day, Calzetta keeps a photo of Hawke-Petit and the two daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, on her desk. She hasn't been able to go to their memorial garden, which is where the house they died in used to stand, but she hopes to go this summer with flowers.
"It's sort of like opening a wound a little. Your spirit goes into a place that you were before," she said. "There's a lot of pain there."

Fashion Week cozies up to fall
By Sarah LeTrent, CNN
updated 2:17 PM EST, Fri February 14, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Designers launched fall 2014 collections over the past seven days in New York
Trends favored cozy sweaters, heritage fabrics and menswear-inspired shoes
Von Furstenberg, Tahari and Karan all celebrated anniversaries in the business
(CNN) -- Pelt-wearing New York Fashion Week attendees were pelted with the elements Thursday as runway shows by influential brands Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, J. Mendel and Marc Jacobs closed out the weeklong affair.
CNN spoke with WGSN fashion forecaster Sheila Aimette before the 90-plus shows and presentations about what trends would make an autumnal appearance in 2014. Among her predictions were "Americana and wild, wild West inspiration," heritage fabrics and menswear-inspired pieces.
The predicted trends largely fell into place, with designers mixing and matching inspirations.
CNN Living will be on the scene (and backstage) as designers showcase their fall 2014 collections at New York Fashion Week from February 6-13. J. Mendel, under creative director Gilles Mendel, debuted his fall collection on the last day of Fashion Week.
This look from J. Mendel played with jewel tones and geometric blocking.
J. Mendel complemented this fall ensemble with a red, black and white color-blocked tote.
J. Mendel's collection was a colorful parade of furs.
J. Mendel used a boldly-dyed fur to accent a piece of color-blocked outerwear.
Hernan Lander, a New York-based Dominican designer, also showed his collection on the last day of Fashion Week, February 13.
Hernan Lander paired leather on leather to create edgy suiting for a model.
Hernan Lander also added some edge with a backless, full-length dress.
Designer Nanette Lepore kept to her bold color aesthetic during her fashion show on February 12.
Lepore paired socks with ankle-strap heels for a cozy fall look.
All of Lepore's looks were hand-crafted in New York.
Nanette Lepore kept maroon suiting feminine with a tiger print belt.
Nanette Lepore walks down the runway with her daughter, Violet, after showing her fall collection.
Malaysian-born designer Zang Toi showed his fall collection on February 12. He opened up the show with a series of tailored, gray plaid pieces.
Later in the show, he upped the flashy factor by incorporating Kelly green into gowns, bowties and even updos.
Zang Toi was one of many designers that played with a cape silhouette, as seen here, during this New York Fashion Week.
After the last outfit, Zang Toi took his turn down the runway with the green-haired model.
For a flashy finish, Zang Toi paired a sleek, black silk gown with a Kelly green-lined, full-length cape coat.
Ken Kaufman and Isaac Franco of KAUFMANFRANCO showed their sophisticated fall collection on February 12.
A model walked graced the runway in a little black dress with an edgy open back.
A bare-legged model rocked a cozy coat down the runway.
KAUFMANFRANCO debuted a metallic cocktail dress as part of their fall 2014 collection.
Interesting cutouts were featured throughout the label's fall collection.
The designers also played with metallic hues in their floor-length gowns.
Betsey Johnson, who is 71 years old, showed her "Betsey's Hot" collection on February 12. Fittingly, she came out with firefighters (and her granddaughters!) at the end of the show.
Her exuberant collection was based on the film "American Hustle" and popstar Rihanna.
Keeping with the red-hot theme, Betsey Johnson worked with bright hues throughout her fall collection.
Sexy silhouettes accented by fur, leopard print and sparkles ruled the runway.
No models were harmed in the making of this photograph! There was a tense moment when one model slipped on the Betsey Johnson runway. Luckily, she recovered her fall just in time.
Betsey Johnson played with texture by lining a black skirt with tulle and crocheting a red mesh top.
During the final walk, the models wore matching outfits and carried heart balloons. Betsey's show, season after season, has a party atmosphere.
Johnson Hartig, who designs under the Libertine name, debuted his fall collection on February 11. Models danced down the runway for the final walk.
Faux bobs and bright colors added to quirky-cool vibe.
Libertine used playful patterns all the way down to the tights.
Libertine's collection also included menswear. Many of the jackets were embellished with skull-and-crossbones patches.
Hartig painted a new image of the classic trench coat.
Painted details were also shown on a suit.
Socks were layered on top of tights for an extra layer of warmth -- and color! T-strap heels appeared in Libertine's show, and have been seen throughout many of the fall collections.
Badgley Mischka, the line by duo Mark Badgley and James Mischka, debuted their fall collection on February 11 at Lincoln Center.
Badgley Mischka's fall collection included both evening and everyday wear.
Leopard print was used in many pieces of Badgley Mischka's fall collection.
The Badgley Mischka show was not short on gold and sparkles.
A heavy fabric, floral brocade gown was one of Badgley Mischka's stand-out looks.
The Milly by Michelle Smith fall collection was inspired by "off-duty ballerinas."
Fringe detailing, which is a big trend for fall 2014, was on display at the Milly show on February 10.
The Milly collection also embodied plenty of shine.
The fall collection also juxtaposed daytime and nighttime looks for an easy transition from work day to date night.
Many of Michelle Smith's designs were clean and classic with an elongating silhouette.
Michelle Smith paired a fur sweater with a flowing, pleated skirt for one of her looks.
Designer Michelle Smith and her daughter came out to applause at the end of her fashion show on February 10.
Mathieu Mirano opened up his February 10 show with a structured leather trench coat.
Mathieu Mirano combined edgy, motorcycle-worthy pieces with feminine silhouettes.
Mirano played with leather in many of his fall pieces.
At just 22 years old, Mirano showcased his highly tailored pieces to the audience at Lincoln Center.
Clean and sharp lines dominated Mirano's collection.
Carolina Herrera played with chic, geometric prints during her show on February 10. At 75 years old, Herrera was still able to breathe new life into her iconic brand. The show attracted notable figures from the fashion and film world, including Tina Fey, Dita Von Teese and Anna Wintour.
Karlie Kloss wore a fez down the runway for Carolina Herrera.
Herrera incorporated highly architectural elements into the typical gown, like this cape-like silhouette. Herrera created a fall collection of abstract prints for women looking to make a statement.
Vivienne Tam showed her collection on February 9. Here, the designer is seen fine-tuning details before her big show.
The runway had a psychedelic backdrop at Vivienne Tam's show.
Many of Tam's pieces, like this printed maxi dress, had a 70's silhouette.
Vivienne Tam showcased her signature Eastern-inspired aesthetic with this intricately laced red dress.
Vivienne Tam paired many of her digital prints with patterned tights.
Among her prints inspired by cave murals in Dunhuang, China, Tam also played around with the fur accents for fall's chilly temperatures.
Custo Barcelona, a line by brothers Custo and David Dalmau, showed its fall collection on February 9.
Two-toned jackets and separates were a prominent theme in Custo Barcelona's show.
Many of Custo Barcelona's looks also played with patchwork.
Custo Barcelona is known for its graphic and colorful designs.
Hues of neon pink were incorporated into many of Custo Barcelona's looks, like this one.
A model wears the signature bandage dress during the Herve Leger by Max Azria show on February 8. All the models sported sleek ponytails with a streak of blue or coral.
Herve Leger updated the brand's signature bodycon dresses with cut-outs and corsets.
A model walks down the runway in a burst of orange at Herve Leger.
Monique Lhuillier went modern and romantic during her show on February 8. She is best known for her gowns that are synonymous with red carpet style.
Monique Lhuillier paired many of her looks with lace boots.
Lhuillier incorporated fuschia tones into many of her pieces.
Lhuillier said she researched Parisian couture techniques for this collection.
Models do a rehearsal walk before the Jill Stuart show on February 8. A popular motif in Jill Stuart's collection was metallic polka dots (seen here on the dress and tights).
Many of Jill Stuart's dresses, like these two seen here, featured intricate beading.
Jill Stuart incorporated a few outerwear pieces into her collection, like this black wool coat.
Jill Stuart also showcased a play on the classic leather pencil skirt.
Jill Stuart's collection worked in a predominantly black-and-white palette with occasional maroon and dark blue pieces. Nicole Miller showed her fall collection of whimsical yet modern designs on Friday, February 7.
On the runway, Nicole Miller mixed and matched plaid patterns with prints.
Rebecca Minkoff sends a model down the runway in a slew of navy tones and a belted fur stole.
Rebecca Minkoff is just as known for her apparel as her accessories. She debuted her fall collection on February 8 in front of celebrities like singer Carrie Underwood and actress Anna Kendrick.
Rebecca Minkoff played around with luxe sweatshirts during her February 8 fashion show.
Rebecca Minkoff paired tassled, two-tone leather booties with many of her looks.
Rebecca Minkoff showed off her line of everyday, seemingly effortless pieces on the second day of the biannual event.
Carmen Marc Valvo presented his collection of feminine pieces on the second day of the event.
Models make their final walk at Carmen Marc Valvo.
Daisy Fuentes and Neiman Marcus fashion director Ken Downing sit front row at Carmen Marc Valvo's show. Other celebrities in attendance were Katie Couric and Vanessa Williams.
Carmen Marc Valvo was inspired by "warrior women" as seen in this somewhat knightly piece.
However, Carmen Marc Valvo still stayed true to his glamorous roots as seen in this red-orange sheath dress.
This is only the second time Zimmermann (by Aussie sisters Nicky and Simone Zimmermann) has shown at New York Fashion Week, but statement pieces like this fluffy, powder blue number are quickly making them a mainstay.
Zimmermann referred to their collection as "cloud stompers."
Oversized coats were one of the many themes at Zimmermann's show on February 7.
Menswear-inspired shoes, like these at Zimmermann, have been popping up all over the runways this season.
Nautica shows its Black Sail collection for men on Friday, February 7. Luckily, it was warmer in Lincoln Center than it was outside in the frigid Northeastern temperatures.
A model walks down the runway in leather pants for Nautica.
Audience members in the front row look on as a model displays a look by Nautica.
Nautica is known for its men's sportswear, like these ski goggles.
Models at Nautica re-emerge on the runway to conclude the show.
A model walks the runway in warm wool layers for Nautica.
Marissa Webb, the former head designer for J. Crew, showed her own line on the first day of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The silhouette at Marissa Webb mostly paired layered, boxy tops with skinny pants. Marissa Webb played on proportions and shapes as seen in this detailing.
Marissa Webb styled many coats with leather arm warmers to lengthen the sleeve.
Japanese-born designer Tadashi Shoji sent lace and embroidered gowns down the runway like this red, long-sleeved number on February 6, 2014.
Tadashi Shoji said his inspiration was the "beauty, romance, and mystery of the Alhambra Palace" in Granada, Spain. Tadashi Shoji sends a laser-cut cape down the runway.
Instagram, and Twitter, and Facebook, oh my! The audience photographs the Richard Chai fashion show on February 6, 2014.

New York Fashion Week: Off the runway
Is America ready for this top model?
The Western-wear movement didn't translate into full shotgun-and-chaps ensembles; rather, pastoral elements roamed through many of the collections. Michael Kors debuted an all-leather fringe skirt, Rebecca Minkoff had tasseled booties, Rag & Bone featured a buffalo-check mohair coat, and Derek Lam showed a patchwork skirt of green, black and brown leather squares.
Meanwhile, leather goods company Coach revealed its first ready-to-wear collection under the direction of the company's new executive creative director, Stuart Vevers, with leather, shearling and wool outerwear, along with fringe-flapped and leather cross-body bags to accessorize.
Cushnie et Ochs, by Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs, paired many of its plunging silhouettes with black cowboy hats.
"A New York girl packing for Texas," Michelle Ochs said of the line's inspiration after the show during a Q&A at the American Express VIP Card Member Lounge at Milk Studios.
Australian Dion Lee explored his roots with crocodile hide and snakeskin detailing and convict-uniform-inspired gray pieces.

Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.
In addition to fringe benefits, fall will come equipped with cozy knits and comfortable layers. Variations on the poncho coat were shown by Nanette Lepore, Thakoon and Tommy Hilfiger, among others. The Row, by Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, cocooned models in cashmere capes and funnel-neck sweaters.
As predicted, women's wear looked toward the menswear sector: pristine tailoring in suit jackets and trousers, sensible oxfords and glittering loafers (as seen in Tracy Reese's show). The message: Snug can be sexy, but less skin is more in fall 2014.
But, of course, there's always room for old-world glamor: Pamella Roland, Reem Acra, Badgley Mischka and Carolina Herrera played with boldly sequined and patterned evening dresses. Zac Posen's grand ballgowns in teal, black, periwinkle, orange and red barely fit down the runway.
Why you're still wearing those ladylike fashions
Erin Fetherston based her collection on the mid-century glamor of Grace Kelly and Edith Bouvier Beale, pairing brocade and ball skirts with delicate, pearl-lined tulle gloves designed by Hardly Alice.
Meanwhile, Rebecca Taylor, Phillip Lim, Tibi and Marc Jacobs played with spring pastels in powder blues and purples -- with Jacobs showing his eponymous collection amid a backdrop of hanging clouds.
The Rodarte collection was invaded by dresses printed with images of Luke Skywalker, Yoda, C-3PO, R2-D2 and the Death Star. Jeremy Scott went sporty with full-length furry jersey dresses, tube socks and Madballs prints: a freaky, popular toy from the '80s.
There was also the return of the supermodel to the runway: Coco Rocha walked for Zac Posen, and Victoria's Secret angels strutted, too: Karolina Kurkova for Cushnie et Ochs, Adriana Lima for Jason Wu and Candice Swanepoel for Desigual.
Of course, we can't talk about Fashion Week without a few spectacles: A streaker at Prabal Gurung was tackled on the runway, a wall dripped with melted chocolate at Opening Ceremony (just in time for Valentine's Day), and a stage rotated with models in Brooklyn for Alexander Wang.
Diane Von Furstenberg celebrated 40 years in the business, as did Elie Tahari; Donna Karan celebrated 30. We expect these mainstays to come on strong come fall at the spring and summer shows. Visit CNN Living for more New York Fashion Week coverage until then.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. fighter jets fired missiles and laser-guided bombs at an Iraqi missile site Wednesday, after six to eight surface-to-air missiles were fired at British aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly zone, U.S. and British military officials said. The Iraqi News Agency said one Iraqi farmer was killed and two other civilians were wounded. Iraq reported that it had "almost certainly shot down" one aircraft, but Pentagon officials said the U.S. and British planes returned safely to their bases.
The Arab League on Wednesday condemned the firing of missiles at Iraq, saying it "rejects the principle of resorting to force to settle conflicts and considers this U.S.-British action unacceptable."
The military confrontation occurred earlier Wednesday as British aircraft were conducting a routine patrol. The flyovers, in effect since August 1992, aim to protect Shiite Muslim Iraqis.
The Iraqis fired the surface-to-air missiles at the aircraft from a site southwest of Talil, near Ur, according to Maj. Joe LaMarca, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command.
He described the Iraqi attack as "unprovoked."
U.N. staff are removing leftover land mines and unexploded ordnance in northern Iraq that have killed 24,000 people between 1991 and 1997
Iraq protests land-mine removal operations
The United States and Britain reported no problems in the northern no-fly zone, where patrols resumed despite Iraqi threats to shoot down fighter aircraft.
Meanwhile, the Iraqi government told the United Nations it objected to U.N. procedures for removing tens of thousands of land mines in Kurdish-dominated northern Iraq.
The United States and its allies have been patrolling that area since 1991 to protect the Kurds after a failed uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Iraq contends the mine-removal operations are taking place without proper authorization, because the staff entered Iraq illegally. News correspondents said that likely means their entry was from Turkey, rather than government-controlled border posts. Iraqi Foreign Minister Saeed al-Sahaf asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to remove his staff.
Diplomats and U.N. officials estimate there are between 5 million and 10 million land mines and unexploded ordnance in northern Iraq from the 1991 Gulf War and from Iraq's long-
running battles with Iran in the 1980s. There have been some 24,000 fatalities between 1991 and 1997 from mines or ordnance, they said. Many of the land mine victims are women and children.
Under the U.N. Office of Project Services de-mining program, Iraqi citizens are being trained to help in the laborious and highly dangerous removal operation.
Correspondents John King and Jane Arraf and Reuters contributed to this report.
