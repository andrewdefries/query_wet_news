Killer's manifesto: 'You forced me into a corner'
Story Highlights• Cho Seung-Hui sent 1,800-word manifesto, photos and videos to NBC • Cho sent images of himself pointing gun at camera, at himself • Cho apparently mailed package between the two shootings • Virginia special justice in 2005 declared Cho mentally ill Adjust font size:
BLACKSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- Cho Seung-Hui said Monday's massacre on the Virginia Tech campus could have been avoided and said "you forced me into a corner," in a videotaped message he mailed to NBC News.NBC News reported that Cho mailed the package at 9:01 a.m. Monday -- during the two hours between the shootings at the West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory and Norris Hall, which left 33 people dead, including Cho, who took his own life. "You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today," Cho said in one of the videos that aired Wednesday night on NBC. "But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off." (Watch Cho's menacing last messages )In another video broadcast on NBC, Cho told the camera "When the time came I did it, I had to."Cho spoke about the shootings in the past tense, but it is unclear when the video messages were recorded. MSNBC.com reported that Cho also discussed "martyrs like Eric and Dylan" apparently referring to Columbine High School gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 13 people and themselves on April 20, 1999, in Littleton, Colorado. Cho railed against the wealthy and other unnamed enemies in the angry messages."You had everything you wanted. Your Mercedes wasn't enough, you brats. Your golden necklaces weren't enough, you snobs. Your trust fund wasn't enough. Your vodka and cognac weren't enough. All your debaucheries weren't enough. Those weren't enough to fulfill your hedonistic needs. You had everything," MSNBC.com quoted Cho as saying.The package included an 1,800 word statement and 27 QuickTime videos showing Cho talking to the camera and discussing religion and his hatred of the wealthy, MSNBC.com reported. (Interactive: Cho's manifesto)It also included several photographs of Cho posing and pointing handguns at the camera. At least one photograph showed Cho pointing a pistol at his head. Another showed Cho holding a knife to his throat.The package was sent by overnight mail, but did not arrive until Wednesday because the address and ZIP code were wrong."This may be a very new critical component of this investigation," State Police Col. Steve Flaherty said.When the network received the package, it immediately notified authorities and the original documents were sent to the FBI for analysis, Flaherty said.CNN also learned Wednesday that in 2005 Cho was declared mentally ill by a Virginia special justice, who declared he was "an imminent danger" to himself, a court document states.A temporary detention order from General District Court in the commonwealth of Virginia said Cho "presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness."A box indicating that the subject "Presents an imminent danger to others as a result of mental illness" was not checked.In another part of the form, Cho was described as "mentally ill and in need of hospitalization, and presents an imminent danger to self or others as a result of mental illness, or is so seriously mentally ill as to be substantially unable to care for self, and is incapable of volunteering or unwilling to volunteer for treatment."A handwritten section of the form describes Cho. "Affect is flat and mood is depressed," said the order, which was signed December 14 by Special Justice Paul M. Barnett. "He denies suicidal ideation. He does not acknowledge symptoms of a thought disorder. His insight and judgment are normal."Student complaintsPolice first investigated Cho in November 2005 after a student complained about him calling her and contacting her in person, university police Chief Wendell Flinchum said. (Watch how police learned of Cho's troubles )Cho was sent to the university's Office of Judicial Affairs, which handled the complaint, the outcome of which is confidential, university officials said. "The student declined to press charges and referred to Cho's contact with her as annoying," Flinchum said of the November investigation. Police investigated him again the next month when a female student complained about instant messages Cho sent her, Flinchum said. "Again, no threat was made against that student. However, she made a complaint to the Virginia Tech Police Department and asked that Cho have no further contact with her," the chief said. After police spoke to Cho, they received a call from a student concerned that he might be suicidal.Officers spoke to Cho "at length" then asked him to see a counselor. He agreed to be evaluated by Access Services, an independent mental health facility in Blacksburg, the chief said."A temporary detention order was obtained and Cho was taken to a mental health facility" on December 13, 2005, he said. A student asking to be identified only as Andy said he was the one who told police that Cho was suicidal. Police "took [Cho] away to the counseling center for a night or two," said the student, who used to room with Cho. (Watch Cho's roommates describe his 'crazy' behavior )Authorities said they received no more complaints about Cho before the shootings, Flinchum said.The university and its police continue to defend themselves against students' complaints that they weren't adequately warned about Cho -- even after two people were killed in a dormitory early Monday morning. (Watch how large universities protect students )Though police have linked a gun used in Norris Hall -- where 31 people, including Cho, died -- they have yet to say he is officially accused of the first shootings. (Learn more about those killed in the rampage)Professor recalls 'mean streak'As tales of Cho's worrisome behavior continued to surface Wednesday, a renowned poet and author who taught the 23-year-old gunman called the notion that he was troubled "crap" and said he was "mean."Nikki Giovanni said she immediately suspected Cho when she got word of the shootings. (Watch Giovanni declare at a Tuesday convocation, 'We are Virginia Tech' )"I knew when it happened that that's probably who it was," Giovanni said, referring to her former pupil. "I would have been shocked if it wasn't."Cho's poetry was so intimidating -- and his behavior so menacing -- that Giovanni had him removed from her class in the fall of 2005, she said. Giovanni said the final straw came when two of her students quit attending her poetry sessions because of Cho."I was trying to find out, what am I doing wrong here?" Giovanni recalled thinking, but the students later explained, "He's taking photographs of us. We don't know what he's doing." (Classmates called Cho 'question mark kid')Giovanni went to the department's then-chairwoman, Lucinda Roy, and told her, "I was willing to resign before I was going to continue with him." Roy took Cho out of Giovanni's class."I know we're talking about a troubled youngster and crap like that, but troubled youngsters get drunk and jump off buildings; troubled youngsters drink and drive," Giovanni said. "I've taught troubled youngsters. I've taught crazy people. It was the meanness that bothered me. It was a really mean streak." (Watch how the cause of Cho's behavior could have been physical )Roy, who taught Cho one-on-one after removing him from Giovanni's class, recalled Cho exhibiting a palpable anger and secretly taking photographs of other students while holding the camera under his desk. (Watch the professor tell how her student frightened her )His writings were so disturbing, she said, that she went to the police and university administrators for help. "The threats seemed to be underneath the surface," she said. "They were not explicit and that was the difficulty the police had."Ian MacFarlane, who had class with Cho, said two plays written by Cho were so "twisted" that MacFarlane and other students openly pondered "whether he could be a school shooter." (Read MacFarlane's blog and the two plays)University stands by handling of shootingThough two professors, Cho's former roommates and a classmate and police all recall Cho behaving in a disturbing manner, officials said there was nothing criminal about his demeanor. The gun shop owner who sold him the Glock 9 mm, one of the guns used at Norris Hall, said Cho easily passed a background check last month before buying the weapon. (Watch dealer recount selling weapon to Cho )Asked about Roy's concerns that Cho was writing troubling plays and poems in his classes, Flinchum said no official report was filed."These course assignments were for a creative writing course and the students were encouraged to be imaginative and artistic," the chief said. "The writings did not express any threatening intentions or allude to criminal activity. No criminal violation had taken place."Flinchum's remarks were the latest in the university's defense, not only of its handling of situations that arose before the shootings, but also of how it handled situations in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at West Ambler Johnston dorm.The recurring question: Why weren't students warned or the campus locked down before Cho was able to walk into Norris Hall more than two hours later and exact the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history? (Watch how Virginia Tech students will never forget Monday's massacre )Flinchum said Wednesday that details gleaned from the investigation at the dorm led to a decision among university officials and police that the campus did not need to be locked down."There are a lot of details we were providing to the administration and a decision was made based on that information," the chief said. University President Charles Steger has said police believed the incident was "a domestic fight, perhaps a murder-suicide" that was contained to one dorm room. Police cordoned off the 895-student dorm and all residents were told about the shooting as police looked for witnesses, Steger said. "I don't think anyone could have predicted that another event was going to take place two hours later," Steger said.Authorities are still investigating whether Cho had any accomplices in planning or executing Monday's rampage.

Supreme Court to hear case about 'sex slave' Web siteStory Highlights Glenn Marcus was convicted of abusing woman who agreed to pose as "sex slave" Marcus posted pictures of the woman on his for-profit Web site Appeals court overturned his sentence on procedural grounds At issue, whether Marcus took relationship too far and held woman against her will Next Article in Crime » By Bill Mears CNN Supreme Court Producer	Editor's note: Details of the case may be disturbing to some readers. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will delve into the shadowy world of sadomasochism next year as it looks into the case of a sex trafficker, known as the "S&M Svengali," whose criminal conviction had been set aside. The Supreme Court will hear a case next year involving a sadomasochism Web site. The justices Tuesday agreed to accept the government's appeal of a case involving Glenn Marcus, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison for the sexual abuse, physical mutilation and psychological humiliation of a woman who had agreed to be photographed as his "sex slave." A federal appeals court threw out the conviction, saying some of the offenses occurred before the 2000 Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which was used to prosecute Marcus. Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- who was on that appeals court -- did not take part in the high court's consideration of whether to accept the appeal, and is not likely to attend oral arguments, which would take place early next year. Like her colleagues on the appeals bench, Sotomayor said at the time of the ruling that prior precedents required the conviction be set aside, but she conceded the Supreme Court might view the issue differently. She noted the justices had, in some cases, found that lower court errors in application of the law "do not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings." According to the trial record, Marcus ran a Web site that featured photos he had taken of women who acted as "sex slaves" and were subjected to varying levels of physical abuse. The woman at the center of the case -- identified only as "Jodi" -- had met the defendant in 1998 and agreed to participate in his commercial activities.

At issue was whether Marcus took the relationship too far and held Jodi against her wishes. Prosecutors claim he manipulated and forced the woman to undergo the punishment, then write about it for the Web site. The incidents took place at various locations between 1999 and 2001. Attorneys for Marcus said the relationship was consensual, even enjoyable, and that Jodi had signed an employment contract and was provided for through the for-profit Web site, which had paying members and advertising. They also said that while the public may find the details unsettling, it was done in the privacy of homes. The woman testified she felt like a prisoner and she could not escape her situation. Her head was shaved and the word "slave" was written on her stomach by Marcus with a knife. She claimed she was whipped regularly, hung by her arms from posts, and subjected to a range of humiliating poses. The appellate court concluded that Jodi never benefited financially, since Marcus had kept profits from the Web site. Other women along the East Coast also were involved in Marcus' master-slave business. The case is U.S. v. Marcus (08-1341).

Iran nuclear program self-sufficient, top official claims By the CNN Wire Staff Iran's nuclear program self-sufficient?STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Iran has been trying to develop this capability because of sanctions, the U.S. saysIran's yellowcake mine could supply a weapons program, expert saysIran is now producing yellowcake, but it's not clear that means nuclear independenceThe United States fears that Iran wants a nuclear bomb, but Tehran denies it (CNN) -- Iran now produces everything it needs for the nuclear fuel cycle, making its nuclear program self-sufficient, the head of the country's Atomic Energy Organization told state media Sunday. The Islamic republic has begun producing yellowcake, Ali Akbar Salehi told Press TV. Salehi's announcement came just a day before Iran is to continue stalled nuclear talks with the so-called P5 plus 1 countries -- Germany and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom. That's no coincidence, CNN's Reza Sayah says. Iran wants to show that despite ever-tighter sanctions, it is not negotiating from a position of weakness. The United States was not surprised by the announcement, National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer told CNN. "Iran has been trying to develop an indigenous program for years given that the import of yellowcake is banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions," he said. But he said the move raises further concerns about Iran's intentions, "given that Iran's own supply of uranium is not enough for a peaceful nuclear energy program." U.S. fears Iran has long-range missile

Salehi said the yellowcake was coming from the Gachin mine. That mine is too small to produce all the yellowcake for a nuclear energy program -- Iran's official reason for building nuclear reactors -- but could be useful for a secret nuclear weapons program, nuclear expert David Albright told CNN. "The Gachin mine is tiny relative to what is needed for a nuclear power program," he said. But it "could be significant from the standpoint of a covert nuclear weapons program, since it could produce plenty of uranium for an Iranian nuclear weapons program." Iran has another mine and mill, but they are not yet operating, he said. That mine is twice as large, though still small from the point of view of a nuclear power program. The United Nations nuclear watchdog does not inspect Iran's uranium mines and does not know how much uranium Gachin produces, Albright said. "So the main interest in Gachin is finding ways to ensure that all its uranium is accounted for. Iran has little interest in allowing that right now," he concluded. Yellowcake, an intermediate stage in processing uranium, is a uranium oxide concentrate which is then heated to remove impurities, the International Atomic Energy Agency says. Iran had been importing it, Salehi said, but is now mining it and processing it within the country. The IAEA monitors Iran's yellowcake processing at the Esfahan Uranium Conversion Facility. Despite Iran's claims that it can now run the entire nuclear fuel cycle without help from abroad, it is not clear that Tehran actually has the technology to turn enriched uranium into fuel rods to run a nuclear reactor. Russia is supplying the fuel rods for Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor. The United States and its allies fear that Iran is trying to produce a nuclear bomb. Iran denies it. The nuclear talks are set to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday and Tuesday, said a spokeswoman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief. The spokeswoman said the goal of the talks is to end Iran's nuclear enrichment program. National Security Council spokesman Hammer said they were "to underscore the concern of the entire international community in Iran's actions and intentions." It has been more than a year since the Islamic state has had formal discussions with the P5 plus 1. Iran has been under stiff sanctions over its continuation of uranium enrichment. Two Iranian nuclear scientists were targeted by bombers on Monday, leaving one dead. Iran blamed Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom's spy agencies for the attacks, which killed Majid Shahriari and injured Fereydoun Abbasi. But Salehi said Sunday that the "assassination of Iranian scientists will not hamper our progress."CNN's Kate Bolduan and Pam Benson contributed to this report.

Political leaders plan another day of deficit-reduction talks From Deirdre Walsh and Jessica Yellin, CNN House Speaker John Boehner has said Republicans cannot support a major deal as long as President Obama and Democrats insist on increasing taxes STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: An official says Obama said Sunday he won't accept a short-term dealNEW: A Boehner aide says there was never a framework for an agreementGOP continues to insist on no tax hikes, Dems push a "balanced" approachThe U.S. must raise its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by August 2 or risk a default Washington (CNN) -- A day after a 75-minute session, talks will resume Monday to try to reach a deficit-reduction deal and pave the way for a hike in the nation's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, a White House spokesman said Sunday. White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said on his Twitter account on Sunday night that congressional leaders will return to the White House for further negotiations on Monday. At 11 a.m. that same morning, President Barack Obama will hold a press conference in the White House briefing room, according to his official schedule. These announcements are the first formal fall-out of Sunday's night talks on the subject, led by the president and involving top politicians from the House and Senate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said afterward that Democrats are "still hopeful for a large bipartisan agreement," one that will do "no harm to the middle class or to economic growth (and) protect Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries." Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile said that he found it "baffling that the president and his party continue to insist on massive tax hikes in the middle of a jobs crisis." Those comments echoed many others made by key figures in both parties, as they posture to try get a deal that cuts into the nation's debt. Republicans initiated the fight when they demanded drastically reduced spending (but no tax hikes) before they agreed to raise the nation's debt ceiling. Obama responded by saying he backs an ambitious plan to reach $4 trillion, mostly through cuts but also with revenue increases. Debt-ceiling talks continue

If Congress doesn't act by August 2, the government could begin defaulting on its obligations. The president hinted at that sense of urgency Sunday. When asked before the meeting's start if a deal can be reached within 10 days, he told reporters, "We need to." Meanwhile, a Democratic congressional aide said Sunday's talks produced "no breakthroughs yet," as the president pushed still for a "grand bargain-style deal that includes revenues, like getting rid of millionaire tax breaks, while Republicans argued it was time to lower sights to a smaller deal that relies on cuts alone." A senior Obama administration official said the president continued to push for a "big deal," saying he would not accept a short-term agreement or anything that in the White House's view is not balanced. As he has said previously, he challenged congressional leader to step up and do something substantial. An aide to House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, said the Ohio Republican countered by saying he wanted a deal that was based on previously discussed budget cuts outlined by a bipartisan group led by Vice President Joe Biden. Boehner had hinted at the GOP's strategy on Saturday evening, when he issued a statement saying that his party cohorts could not support a major deal as long as Obama and Democrats insist on increasing taxes. He said that any such revenue-raising initiative would prevent the bulk of Republicans from supporting a more ambitious deal, even if it was one including cutting spending and reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare. The House speaker said, as a result, that the talks' parameters would be scaled back to focus on budget cuts alone. The White House immediately pushed back, with a senior administration official saying Boehner had initially accepted the need to increase tax rates on wealthy Americans as part of a deal. But then, the official said, Republicans offered a different plan in the talks with Obama that began Thursday. In the statement Sunday night, the Boehner aide insisted that Obama "agreed with the speaker that their previous talks did not produce any agreement." Obama believes "it is time to solve this problem," White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said on ABC's "This Week" program Sunday. He added that Obama's "call to the (congressional) leaders is to step up and be leaders." The Treasury Department has warned that failure to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a default, which could push interest rates to skyrocket and cause the dollar to plummet. But Republicans, including those controlling the House, have said they'll block any such move without substantial budget cuts. A U.S. default on its debt obligations would have "real nasty consequences" for the United States and the global economy, the new director of the International Monetary Fund said in an interview broadcast Sunday. "It would jeopardize the stability at large," Christine Lagarde, who last week became the first woman to head the global financial institution, told ABC. Still, such warnings didn't prevent party leaders on Sunday talk shows from reverting back to time-tested talking points that suggested the two sides were still far from an agreement. "What is really appalling is to see our Republican colleagues essentially providing a form of extortion -- if you don't agree to deficit reduction the way we want it, we'll put all the jobs at risk, because we will allow the United States to default on its debt," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, on the CNN show "State of the Union." "That's irresponsible." At the heart of the GOP resistance is a bedrock principle pushed by conservative crusader Grover Norquist against any kind of tax increase. A pledge pushed by Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform, has been signed by more than 230 House members and 40 senators, almost all of them Republicans. After Sunday nights talks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman Adam Jentleson said that the Nevada Democrat wants "an approach that is balanced between spending and revenues." However long it takes, he said that Reid is "firmly committed" to striking a deal. "Sen. Reid believes the stakes are too high for Republicans to keep taking the easy way out, and he is committed to meeting every day until we forge a deal, however long it takes," said Jentleson.CNN's Ted Barrett, Dan Lothian and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

Southern Miss takes disciplinary action against students for derogatory chant
By Gustavo Valdes, CNN
updated 1:28 PM EDT, Tue March 20, 2012
Southern Miss pep band members yelled the chant at Angel Rodriguez, right, during a game in Pittsburgh on Thursday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Five pep band members have been removed from the band
Their scholarships have been revoked
They will be required to complete a cultural sensitivity course
Band members chanted "where's your green card" during a basketball game

(CNN) -- Five members of the University of Southern Mississippi pep band have had their scholarships revoked and have been removed from the band after they yelled a derogatory chant at a Puerto Rican player during an NCAA basketball tournament game last week.
The school announced the disciplinary action in a statement Tuesday, saying the five "have been forthcoming, cooperative, contrite and sincerely remorseful."
"They acted rashly and inappropriately, and now see the gravity of their words and actions," Vice President for Student Affairs Joe Paul said. "This is a teachable moment, not only for these students but for our entire student body and those who work with them."
The students will also be required to complete a two-hour training course on cultural sensitivity, the school said. The school has not identified the students.
TV cameras captured the incident during the University of Southern Mississippi-Kansas State University game at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh on Thursday.
As Kansas State point guard Angel Rodriguez shot free throws, several people could clearly be heard chanting, "where's your green card."
The university's president apologized to Rodriguez, saying the chant wasn't representative of the university.
Southern Miss apologizes for band's derogatory chant
Rodriguez said Friday, "I heard it. I don't pay attention to that nonsense, especially because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, so we don't need no type of papers."
"Their athletic director and personnel from their school came to apologize, and I accepted it," he said.
Rodriguez said he realized that there are "ignorant people, and I know that is not how they want to represent their university."
NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said the University of Southern Mississippi "responded in a timely and appropriate fashion to address the matter."
"Any determination of championship misconduct is the purview of the men's basketball committee and will be addressed following the tournament," she said.
The eighth-seeded Kansas State Wildcats beat the ninth-seeded Southern Miss Golden Eagles 70-64, knocking them out of the tournament. Kansas State advanced to the next round, but lost to Syracuse.

Eased travel to Cuba not without hurdles
By Patrick Oppmann, CNN
updated 3:48 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Legal travel to Cuba has been off limits to Americans for decades
"Person-to-person" trips have been greenlighted by the Obama administration
Visitors are required to engage in continuous educational exchange with Cubans
Some operators have had difficulty renewing licenses to offer tours
Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Louis and Bonnie Waterer are spending their retirement filling up their passports, one stamp at a time.
"There are a bunch of people who are trying to visit 100 countries before they die," Louis explained. "This is number 92 for us."
Country No. 92 for the Waterers is Cuba.
But up until a few years ago, even for intrepid travelers like the Waterers, visiting Cuba would have been close to impossible.
After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, Cuba went from being a favorite getaway for Americans to a forbidden destination. Diplomatic relations and direct travel between the United States and Cuba were cut off. U.S. citizens spending money on the island faced hefty fines for "trading with the enemy."
But after decades of false starts, the Obama administration has reinstituted legal travel to Cuba as a way to reach out to the Cuban people.
Classic American cars still in use in Cuba are a curiosity to many foreign visitors.
It's called "people-to-people" travel, and like nearly everything involving Cuba, controversy and politics are involved.
"Each traveler must have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba," U.S. Treasury Department guidelines for people-to-people travel read.
And while the policy has kicked off a debate over what is a "meaningful" exchange, a flood of tour operators has entered the still uncertain world of travel to Cuba.
Americans interested in visiting Cuba are offered free CDs of Cuban music and itineraries that include welcome parties thrown by Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, neighborhood watch groups that were created with the original intention of thwarting a U.S. invasion.
U.S. visitors coming via people-to-people trips shouldn't plan on too much beach time.
Under the Treasury guidelines, tour operators have to plan nearly every moment of the trip, and "people-to-people" travel, at least in theory, excludes relaxing by the pool with umbrella-topped beverages.
Most Americans heading to Cuba go there with the desire to make a connection with a people they have been prevented from having any contact with for generations, according to Tom Popper, president of tour operator Insight Cuba.
"The fact that we are bringing Americans and Cubans together is an incredible thing," Popper said. "It's a travel experience for the Americans, it's an incredible thing for Cubans. Some people in parts of Cuba that we go to, they have never met an American before."
People-to-people travel isn't cheap or easy, though.
A four-night "Weekend in Havana" trip from Insight Cuba, without airfare, sells for about $2,000 per person.
Popper said the high cost of the trips is due to the fact that operators need to send guides with their groups to make sure they comply with the travel regulations, and that renewing the yearly U.S. licenses can take months of navigating a complicated bureaucracy.
This summer, many tour operators wondered if people-to-people travel was ending altogether, after the Treasury Department started denying licenses to operators or simply not responding to renewal requests.
Several tour operators contacted by CNN said that the process may have gotten bogged down by the fact that the renewal application is now close to 200 pages and requires that the operators explain how each stop on the itinerary fosters greater friendship between Americans and Cubans.
"You are doing what you are supposed to be doing and they are changing the rules as we go. The guidelines are so vague," said Michael Sykes, who ran the now-defunct Cuba Cultural Tours.
Sykes laid off four employees after his license expired in July and he was denied a renewal.
"The language is so cryptic and so bureaucratic," he said. "Your average Joe isn't able to do this -- you have to understand the secret language."
Sykes has now hired what he calls a "bloody expensive" lawyer to guide him through the process, and he is hopeful that he will be back to planning trips to Cuba by the end of the year.
Some of the tour operators said they thought the logjam of licenses was caused by political pressure, particularly from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is Cuban-American and a fierce critic of the trips
"What these trips are all about is tourism -- it's tourism," Rubio said on the Senate floor last year. "The reason why this is problematic is it gives money to the Castro government."
Jeff Braunger, a Treasury Department official in charge of the Cuba licensing program, said in an e-mail that the department has approved licenses for 180 tour operators while making sure they are complying with the law.
"We revised the license application criteria to stress to applicants the seriousness of the requirements of the people-to-people licensing program, in part because of reports we received concerning travel under the licenses," Braunger wrote.
But some tour operators said travel to Cuba has become more cumbersome and expensive but is not policed any better. One tour organizer mentioned a recent licensed trip offered by a competitor that included a day of scuba diving.
"It's supposed to be people-to-people, not people-to-fish," the operator said.
And there are also complications on the Cuban side, tour operators said. Last month, the Cuban government abruptly canceled the landing rights for two of the U.S. charter companies operating flights to the island, reportedly over a payment dispute.
But most of the tour operators said the headaches are worth the opportunity to get in early on American tourism to Cuba, which is sure to explode when the embargo is eventually lifted.
"We are back in operations and hope to stay that way," Insight Cuba president Tom Popper said. Popper had to lay off 22 people as he waited several months for the company's license renewal, but he has since added 17 back to his staff.
On a trip organized by Insight Cuba last month, 12 Americans spent their morning speaking with Cubans at a neighborhood art project.
Michael Pettit, a lawyer from Charleston, South Carolina, said he was struck by Cuba's many contrasts during his first people-to-people trip in May.
"I love Cuba," he said. "The history, music, people, photography -- it's all beautiful."
The politics and uncertainty over continued travel between Cuba and the United States persuaded Pettit to book another trip right away, he said.
"One of the reasons I came again is because you never know when you might be able to come legally."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: United States agrees to conduct aerial refueling missions, to transport troops
Malian and French forces recapture the city of Gao, a stronghold of the Islamic militants
The Malian offensive is backed by French forces
Read a version of this story on CNN Arabic.
(CNN) -- The United States is intensifying its involvement in Mali, where local and French forces are battling Islamic militants.
It will support the French military by conducting aerial refueling missions, according to the Pentagon, which released a short statement Saturday following a call between Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.
"The leaders also discussed plans for the United States to transport troops from African nations, including Chad and Togo, to support the international effort in Mali. Secretary Panetta and Minister Le Drian resolved to remain in close contact as aggressive operations against terrorist networks in Mali are ongoing," it read.
U.S. policy prohibits direct military aid to Mali because the fledgling government is the result of a coup. No support can go to the Malian military directly until leaders are chosen through an election.
Six reasons Mali matters
Al Qaeda in Mali behind Algeria attack
The Mali terror connection
Mali conflict takes toll on civilians
But the United States is supporting the effort with intelligence and airlift support.
So far, the U.S. Air Force has flown at least seven C-17 cargo missions into Mali, carrying 200 passengers, mainly French troops, and 168 tons of equipment, according to Maj. Robert Firman, a Pentagon spokesman.
The uptick in U.S. involvement comes as Malian forces loosened the grip that Islamist militants' hold in the country's north with the retaking of the city of Gao.
With the support of French forces, the Malians entered and took control of Gao, which for months had been a militant stronghold, the French defense ministry said.
The advance was made in stages, with forces taking Gao's airport and the main bridge leading to town before entering the rest of the city.
"Jihadist terrorists, who have fought Malian and French armies, have seen their mobile and logistical capabilities reduced," the ministry said in a news release.
The quickening advance of the government forces has brought them to the heart of the territory held by the militants.
Broken limbs, torn lives in northern Mali
The Islamic extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines.
The takeover stoked fear among global security experts that Mali could become a new hub for terrorism.
Refugees tell harrowing stories of life under the Islamist militants.
But the French-based International Federation for Human Rights said it is "very alarmed" by reports that Malian soldiers are themselves carrying out extrajudicial killings and abuses as they counterstrike.
The United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, has called for an increase in international aid for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced by the fighting in the country.
More signs al Qaeda in Mali orchestrated Algeria attack
More than 150,000 refugees have fled Mali into neighboring countries, and another 230,000 are displaced inside Mali, the agency said.
The military's advance into Gao may shed more light on the conditions that residents there have faced. According to the U.N. agency, one former resident told of a hospital stripped of medicine by the armed militants and filling with bodies.
As the Malian troops advance, some other countries in the region are joining the French force aiding them. Between 700 and 800 African troops from Benin, Nigeria, Togo and Burkina Faso have arrived, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday, and a number of Senegalese troops and up to 2,000 from Chad are on the way.
France has 2,150 soldiers on Malian soil, with 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere.
French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital.
Until 1960, Mali had been under French control.
The MNLA, made up of ethnic Tuareg rebels, staged their coup against Mali's central government after returning to Mali well-armed from fighting for late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
No woman has ever won the Daytona 500
Danica Patrick holds the pole position for Sunday's race
Mike Downey says a win for Danica Patrick would be "giant checkered flag for womankind"
Downey: "I will be pulling for Patrick"
Editor's note: Mike Downey is a former columnist for the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.
(CNN) -- "Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life" (1913) is a 13-minute silent movie. In it, Oldfield, the most famous auto racer of his day, races to rescue a damsel in distress whom a mustache-twirling villain has chained to a railroad track.
(You can watch the whole thing on YouTube if you like. Spoiler alert: A few of the characters get killed.)
A hundred years later, Danica Patrick, the most famous auto racer of HER day, will be on a track Sunday in the race of HER life. Very vulnerable, very motivated, she will be a hero to many in the audience and a villain to some.
Go, Danni.
Mike Downey
Daytona 500s have been running since 1959. They have been won by Richard Petty and his dad, by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and his dad, by Davey Allison and his dad, by the brothers Waltrip, by a 50-year-old, by a 20-year-old and by a whole lot of fine gents down South.
Just ain't never been won by no woman.
I will be pulling for Patrick, now that she holds the pole position for Sunday's race, for this reason and for no other -- just because it would be something unique. A surge forward. A giant checkered flag for womankind.
Bleacher Report: Danica Patrick Still Has Much to Prove Amidst NASCAR's Best Drivers
Danica Patrick ready for Daytona 500
Danica Patrick: 'Gender doesn't matter'
Racing pioneer's advice for Danica
You often see women IN auto races. You just seldom see women WIN auto races.
I haven't personally seen one cross a finish line first since Lindsay Lohan drove a VW Beetle to victory in that movie "Herbie: Fully Loaded."
Excuse me, then, for being of the opinion that Danica Patrick winning the Daytona 500 would be a pretty cool thing. It would be up there with other unlikely things I never expected to see in my lifetime, like Ben Affleck maybe beating Steven Spielberg for an Oscar.
Now, note that I didn't call this person the most distinguished driver of her day. Or the best in any way. (Except at posing in a bikini.)
Danica Patrick on February 17 became the first woman to win the pole position for the Daytona 500, considered the Super Bowl of NASCAR. Look back at other milestones for women who have been breaking barriers in sports.
University of New Mexico kicker Katie Hnida, No. 2, attempts an extra point against UCLA in the Las Vegas Bowl on December 25, 2002, becoming the first woman to play in a Division I-A football game. The kick was blocked, but she later became the first woman to score points in college football's top division. Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks records the first slam dunk in women's professional basketball during a game against the Miami Sol on July 30, 2002, in Los Angeles.
Pitcher Ila Borders of the Duluth Dukes became the first woman to win a men's pro baseball game on July 24, 1998, against the Sioux Falls Canaries in Duluth, Minnesota. She was also the first woman to earn a college baseball scholarship.
Jockey Julie Krone rides Colonial Affair across the finish line to win the Belmont Stakes on June 5, 1993. She was the first woman to win a Triple Crown race.
Goalie Manon Rheaume of the Tampa Bay Lightning defends the net during an NHL preseason game against the St. Louis Blues in Tampa on September 23, 1992. She was the first female to play in an NHL game.
Nancy Lieberman poses for a portrait in the 1990s while playing for the women's U.S. national basketball team. In June 1986, she became the first woman to play men's professional basketball with her United States Basketball League debut in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Janet Guthrie stands in front of her car before the Winston Cup Daytona 500 race on February 20, 1977. Later that year she became the first woman to drive in the Indy 500.
Billie Jean King holds up her trophy after defeating Bobby Riggs during the Battle of the Sexes tennis match in Houston on September 20, 1973. She became the first woman to beat a man in a professional tennis match.
Jockey Diane Crump exercises her horse in 1968. She became the first female jockey to ride in the Kentucky Derby on May 2, 1970.
Italian race car driver Maria Teresa de Filippis is seen at the wheel of a Maserati in 1958. She was the first woman to compete in a Formula One race.
Babe Didrikson Zaharias putts in circa 1945. She became the first female to play on the men's PGA Tour in the Los Angeles Open on January 7, 1938. She was also an Olympic gold medalist in track and field.
Betty Robinson, left, wins the women's 100-meter final during the Olympic Games in Amsterdam on July 31, 1928. It was the first time the Olympics included athletic events for women, making her the first woman to win gold.
Gertrude Ederle wades into the water on her way to becoming the first woman to swim the English Channel, which she did in 14 hours and 31 minutes, breaking the previous men's record.

Photos: Female firsts in sports
I have a high regard for the men of this profession, many of whom might find Patrick's famous face in their rear-view mirrors Sunday on their cannonball run toward Victory Lane. It wouldn't shock me a bit if her green No. 10 Chevrolet SS ended up in the back of the pack. Or racked or wrecked. Or up on some tow truck's hook. Or overheating under the hood like a '57 Bel Air.
Pits happen.
If things do go wrong, that's OK. They do to everybody, male or female. Cars break down. Drivers make mistakes. Jerks come out of nowhere and cut you off. Hey, consider yourself lucky these days if you go for a drive and don't end up waiting for deep-voiced Dennis Haysbert and his insurance folks from Allstate.
Bleacher Report: Daytona 500: Danica Patrick Can Break Ground for Women's Sports with Victory
Patrick's life will be totally fine even if she doesn't win. She makes a ton of money. She has a mean, green publicity machine. She even has a new boyfriend. (A fellow driver, Ricky Stenhouse Jr.) She still has her Go Daddy! ads, although, to be perfectly frank with you, I still have no clue to this day what it is Go Daddy! is supposed to do for you.
She is resented by some for her fame.
"What has she ever won?" is a common refrain.

Hey, this woman placed third in the 2009 Indianapolis 500. That is not nothing. Do you know what the great Barney Oldfield's best finish was in an Indy 500? Fifth. He still ended up in movies and doing endorsements and becoming the most famous car racer of his time. That's show biz.
Patrick has come a long way since being a high school cheerleader in Rockton, Illinois, during her Fast Times at Hononegah High teens. She drove go-karts. She had a need for speed. She liked to get behind the wheel of anything with wheels.
What else would you expect of someone born in Beloit, Wisconsin, where a man (Arthur P. Warner) supposedly invented the first automobile speedometer? Or from a woman who was brought up in an Illinois county called Winnebago. I mean, some girls are born to be debutantes or doctors. Danica Patrick was born to be first in line at the DMV.
She is not a true pioneer. I mean, we are not talking Amelia Earhart here.
Odette Siko and Marguerite Mareuse, a couple of Frenchwomen, drove a Bugatti in the 24 Hours of LeMans endurance race of 1932. They took seventh place.
(I can confirm neither did a sexy ad for a "Go Pere!" website.)
Sarah Fisher has driven in the Indy 500 nine times, Lyn St. James seven times.
I once covered a Riverside, California, race where a Ford Mustang driven by St. James was going 160 mph when it swerved into a wall and burst into flames, while a rival car went airborne. St. James was bruised and battered, but limped away to race another day.
Female drivers are tough, man. Shirley Muldowney's nitro-fuel dragster once had a front tire blow in Montreal and she broke both legs when it crashed. If you go to Shirley's website, the autographed items you can purchase include her fire suits.
It isn't as if Daytona hasn't seen any estrogen along with all that testosterone. (No, these are not new products from Pennzoil.) As far back as 1977, a true trailblazer, Janet Guthrie, drove in the 500. She finished ahead of Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Ricky Rudd, Salt Walther, Richard Petty -- not bad.
So she never won it. Big flamin' deal.
You think it's easy to race WITH the best, much less beat them, hey, let's see you try it.
Bleacher Report: Danica Patrick: Why a Win at Daytona 500 Would Ruffle Feathers of Fellow Drivers
Daytona 500s attract the best drivers in the business. It is the Super Bowl of its sport. It has given its fans countless thrills, ever since Lee Petty (daddy of Richard) sped to the checkered flag in his Olds simultaneously with Johnny Beauchamp's T-Bird in a photo finish that required three days to sort out.
(Petty won and was handed a nice $19,000, if you'll pardon the expression, purse.)
Oh, the great competitors we have seen, from "Fireball" Roberts to "Tiny" Lund, from the coincidental Yarborough (Cale) vs. Yarbrough (LeeRoy) clash of 1968, from the climactic spinout of '76 when Pearson was able to get his Mercury to crawl and sputter across the finish line.
What a blast it was in 1989 to see Darrell Waltrip finally win at Daytona on his 17th try -- and on fumes, with a fuel tank that was very definitely on E.
What a pleasure to see the superpopular, bizarrely doomed Dale Earnhardt take the checkered flag there in '98 after two decades of being a Daytona also-ran. To win on the same track where in 2001 he would die. On the same track where in 2004 the same race would be won by his son.
Legends and lore are what it's all about at the Daytona 500.
So I wouldn't mind this one becoming the Danica 500.
Floor it, lady.

Former Prime Minister Sharif set to return to power in Pakistan
From Saima Mohsin, CNN
updated 2:43 AM EDT, Tue May 14, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Sindh province clamps down on rallies after protests over vote rigging
NEW: E.U. election observers say polling was generally "satisfactory or good"
Former prime minister's party appears to have won most National Assembly seats
Attacks on polling stations caused death and injury across the country
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister whose government was overthrown by a military coup more than a decade ago, appears to be back on top in Pakistan, election officials have said, despite claims by other parties of vote rigging.
According to unofficial results disclosed Sunday from the country's violence-marred elections over the weekend, Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N), looks to have won most of the seats in the National Assembly.
One of the country's leading industrialists and richest men, Sharif has been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup when Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999. Sharif was subsequently jailed before going into exile in Saudi Arabia. He returned to Pakistan in 2007.

Support for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which completed a five-year term in power in March, appeared to have fallen away at Saturday's elections after it struggled to tackle the country's myriad problems of extremist violence, chronic power shortages and an enfeebled economy.
Imran Khan, head of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party, leaves the hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, on Wednesday, May 22. Khan suffered spinal fractures and a head injury when he toppled from a forklift that was raising him up to a stage as he campaigned in Lahore for elections held on May 11. Victory in the elections went to Nawaz Sharif, a two-time former prime minister, and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League.
Pakistani supporters of Imran Khan take part in a protest on Monday, May 20, against the killing of Zohra Hussain in Karachi. Hussain, a politician who had alleged vote-rigging in the May 11 elections, was shot dead on Saturday, May 18. There was a re-poll on Sunday, May 19, after accusations of vote-rigging.

Another frontrunner for prime minister, Imran Khan, has been campaigning from his hospital bed after he was injured falling from a lift at a campaign rally on May 7.
Khan, a charismatic former cricketer, has proved a popular candidate among Pakistan's young, urban middle class.
Politics is a bloody affair in Pakistan, and this leadership struggle is no exception. Dozens have been killed in attacks in the weeks leading up to Saturday's election. The most deadly attack, an explosion during a rally in the Kurram tribal district on May 6, killed 18 people and wounded 55.
Ali Haider Gilani, a son of former Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, was kidnapped by gunmen while canvassing for votes in Multan on the final day of campaigning.
The leader of the Pakistan People's Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, has been absent from rallies in the lead-up to the elections. The 24-year old, who became chairman after his mother, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated, is not yet old enough to run for parliament.
Former president Pervez Musharraf announced plans to run in the elections after returning from exile last month, but was disqualified from the race amid claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during his rule.
For the first time, women in tribal regions are running for office. 43-year-old Nusrat Begum is challenging the Taliban for a seat in Lower Dir.

Photos: High turnout, violence mark Pakistan elections
Deposed PM wins Pakistan election
Pakistan votes amid Karachi blasts
Pakistani hope for election
Imran Khan, the former cricket star whose party was participating in general elections for the first time, said voting was rigged.
"Unfortunately, it's because the provincial governments were in power right up till 20 days before the elections, so they had plenty of time to place their people," said Khan, suggesting that police and electoral officials were "used."
He said his party was gathering evidence of the irregularities.
Khan, who was injured in a dramatic fall at a campaign rally just days before voting began, was considered to be a wild card in the election.
Analysts saw him and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) as popular with members of the urban middle class, who support his call to end drone strikes in the country's restive tribal regions and his pledge to sweep away rampant corruption by ending foreign aid.

His party appeared to have secured enough votes to be a notable presence in parliament. And Khan said that despite the alleged voting irregularities, democracy had advanced in the elections.
"I'm very optimistic that the foundation of what we call the new Pakistan has been laid," he said. "Pakistan will never be the same again."
PPP officials also complained of vote rigging in some constituencies in Sindh province and its capital, Karachi, during the elections Saturday, calling on the country's Election Commission to hold a new vote in the affected areas. Other smaller parties threatened boycotts over the alleged irregularities.
Protests, led by Khan's supporters, took place in Karachi over the reported problems.
The provincial government responded Monday by imposing a ban on gatherings of four or more people for rallies and protests, CNN affiliate Geo TV reported.
Opinion: Pakistan vote the first step on a long road
Sharif and the PML-N appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the elections.
In his stronghold of Lahore, Sharif said he was confident his party would form the next government. He said that he hoped his party won enough seats to form a government on its own but that he is willing to work with others to solve the country's problems.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tweeted his congratulations to Sharif and the PML-N on their "emphatic victory."
Sharif had suggested that if elected, he would seek to improve relations with New Delhi. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their partition in 1947. Frosty relations resulting from the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, for which India blamed a Pakistani-based group, have thawed in recent years.
President Barack Obama expressed a willingness to work with the next government that is formed in Islamabad.
"The United States and Pakistan have a long history of working together on mutual interests," Obama said in a statement. "And my administration looks forward to continuing our cooperation with the Pakistani government that emerges from this election as equal partners in supporting a more stable, secure, and prosperous future for the people of Pakistan."
During campaigning, Sharif seemed to take a vague stance on issues of interest to the United States, like the fight against terrorism.
Read more: Key moments of Pakistan's turbulent past
But analysts said they saw that as a political move to secure support from his conservative Islamic base. They noted that Sharif had worked well with U.S. officials during his previous two terms as prime minister during the 1990s.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai called Sharif on Sunday to congratulate him, the Afghan government said.
Violent extremism remains a significant problem in Pakistan, as underlined by frequent deadly attacks by groups like the Pakistani Taliban on people campaigning for the elections. Attacks over the weekend targeted polling stations.
Karachi, the country's biggest city, and Balochistan, a restive province that borders Iran and Afghanistan, appeared to suffer the worst of the violence Saturday and Sunday.
But the attacks failed to deter Pakistanis keen to have their say.
Voter turnout was nearly 60%, the election officials said Sunday. Many people were voting for the first time.
The Election Commission secretary, Ishtiak Ahmed Khan, said the election was free and fair across much of the country, despite the problems in Karachi.
His view received qualified support from election observers from the European Union who reported that at the polling stations they visited, "polling was generally rated as satisfactory or good."
The E.U. observers said in a statement Monday that a higher rate of problems was seen in Sindh, the province where the PPP and PTI had complained of irregularities.
In Karachi, the observers said they "undertook limited observation, during which they saw some serious problems in polling and were also restricted in their activities."
They said they identified some problems in the counting of votes across the country, with 9 out of 59 stations rated as "poor or inadequate."
The national election marks the first transition between civilian governments in the nation's 66-year history. In March, the democratically elected PPP government finished serving a full five-year term.
Pakistan has experienced three military coups and been ruled by generals for about half its history.
CNN's Aliza Kassim, Laura Smith-Spark, Jethro Mullen, Nasir Habib, Shaan Khan, Neda Farshbaf, Saska Vandoorne, Jessica King, Greg Botelho, and journalist Imran Javaid contributed to this report.
