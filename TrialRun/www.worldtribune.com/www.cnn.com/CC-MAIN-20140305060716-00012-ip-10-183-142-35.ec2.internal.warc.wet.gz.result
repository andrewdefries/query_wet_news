Jubilant Chavez opponents revel in referendum defeatStory Highlights NEW: President Hugo Chavez says he will keep pursuing defeated proposals NEW: Student: Vote could mean "start of a new republic of a new Venezuela" White House applauds voters' "desire to live in freedom and democracy" At stake were 69 amendments, one of which would have ended term limits Next Article in World » Read VIDEO PHOTOS CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's detractors danced in the streets Monday after voters shot down a referendum that would have allowed the firebrand leftist to seek re-election indefinitely and tightened socialism's grip on his oil-rich nation. President Hugo Chavez thanks opponents Monday, saying the results show Venezuelan democracy is maturing.more photos » In Caracas, Valencia, Maracaibo and other major cities, large crowds spilled into the streets, shouting, chanting, clapping and waving flags. One man carried a sign proclaiming, "Vota No," which by Monday was more an exclamation than an imperative after voters the day before dismissed 69 proposed amendments to Venezuela's 1999 constitution. Chavez said Monday he accepted the vote, calling the slim margin of victory -- 51 percent to 49 percent, according to early reports -- a "photo finish." The vote represented a rare poll defeat for Chavez, who has generally enjoyed popular support among the lower classes. Among the exceptions: a bitter national strike, an abortive coup against him in 2002 and a 2004 attempt to recall him as president, a vote he easily survived. Many of Monday's revelers were university students who had worked doggedly to defeat the proposals. They burst into singing the national anthem upon hearing news that their efforts paid off. "This is not a moment only for students; it is for the whole country," student Juan Andres Mejia said. "It's time for us to start walking the same path to walking together, and I think this day could be the start of a new republic of a new Venezuela." Watch what led to the referendum's defeat » In Washington, the White House applauded the results of the vote. "We congratulate the people of Venezuela on their vote and their continued desire to live in freedom and democracy," said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. In what he called a talk "from my heart," Chavez said the election results proved Venezuelan democracy was maturing, a sentiment echoed by Tibisay Lucena, president of the National Electoral Council. Thanking his opponents, Chavez told a roomful of supporters and journalists, "Now Venezuelans should have faith in our institutions."

However, Chavez promised to continue his pursuit of the defeated proposals. "Not a single comma of this proposal will be withdrawn," he said, holding up a small red book containing the text of the proposed changes. "I will continue proposing this to the Venezuelan people. The proposal is alive, not dead." One of the more controversial proposed amendments would have abolished term limits, allowing Chavez to hold office indefinitely as long as he is re-elected. The 53-year-old Venezuelan president, who was elected in 1998 as the country's youngest-ever president, has twice been re-elected by large margins. However, the present law prohibits Chavez from seeking re-election when his term ends in 2012. Another amendment on the ballot would have pushed the country more toward socialism. Chavez has said he should have full authority over the autonomous Central Bank as well as the nation's economic policy. These measures, Chavez has said, are necessary to move the economy toward socialism. Since winning a second six-year term in December, Chavez has promised to push forward with his particular brand of socialism and his "Bolivarian Revolution." Chavez has used skyrocketing oil revenues, which reportedly account for about 90 percent of the nation's export earnings, to garner support in the country's poorer neighborhoods. In Venezuela, the poor receive free health care and education, much like in Cuba, which is under the rule of Chavez's friend and mentor, President Fidel Castro. Chavez's opponents say he has undercut Venezuela's democracy by systematically concentrating power in his own hands. In the last year, Chavez has nationalized oil, telephone and power companies and refused to renew the broadcast license for RCTV, an independent open-air television station that had been broadcasting for 53 years. The Venezuelan government later threatened to investigate broadcasters it said were inciting the public to violence over the decision. RCTV returned as a cable and satellite broadcaster in July. On Friday, Chavez threatened to take independent Venezuelan network Globovision off the air if it broadcast partial results of the Sunday referendum. Chavez, a former paratrooper, also routinely lambastes the United States, which has had thin diplomatic but close economic ties with Venezuela. The United States is Venezuela's top oil customer, buying about 1 million barrels a day, and is one of the few countries that can refine its low-quality crude.

Review: Hathaway dazzles in 'Rachel'Story Highlights "Rachel Getting Married" stars Anne Hathaway as just-freed rehab patient Hathaway's sister is getting married; film deliberately has documentary feel Though performances are good, movie flawed by lazy justifications in script Next Article in Entertainment » By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Remember when actresses really lit up the screen? Anne Hathaway rekindles memories of Bette Davis and "Klute"-era Jane Fonda in Jonathan Demme's new film: barely a scene goes by without her pulling on a cigarette. Anne Hathaway and Rosemarie DeWitt star as clashing sisters in "Rachel Getting Married." When Davis took a drag it was a mark of sophistication. By Fonda's time it was beginning to take on neurotic undertones, but was still a talisman of intelligence and seriousness. Today -- having virtually disappeared from the movies -- the cigarette is a sign of stunted growth, a crutch that Kym, Hathaway's character in "Rachel Getting Married," can't put aside. It's also a substitute for the harder stuff she really craves. She's straight out of rehab, heading home for her sister's wedding. Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) is grateful to have her there ... kinda. Kym has a way of sucking the oxygen -- along with the nicotine -- right out of the room. Their dad (Bill Irwin) fusses over her like he's afraid she'll shoot up in front of the priest. The maid of honor hates her guts -- even before Kym insists she should have had the job by birthright. Take it from me, we're a long way from "27 Dresses." Demme and cinematographer Declan Quinn shot "Rachel" on the fly, with a handheld camera and jump cuts. It feels more like reality TV or a cop show than a romantic comedy. I'm guessing that the specific inspiration was the Danish film "The Celebration," the most effective of the so-called "Dogme 95" movies, which was also about a large family gathering that threatened to go nuclear. In any case, for 45 minutes "Rachel" feels like a new lease on life for the director who gave us "The Silence of the Lambs," "Something Wild" and "Philadelphia." More recently Demme has seemed out of touch with audience taste and industry demands (remember "The Truth About Charlie"?), and he's concentrated on documentaries and concert films. Maybe that's why "Rachel" sometimes feels like watching someone else's home movies -- in good ways and bad. (Warning: Lots of wedding speeches ahead.) For a while, the script by Jenny Lumet (Sidney's daughter) seems of a piece with Demme's approach. Brief, glancing scenes indicate tensions and trouble ahead, but it's glossed over in the turmoil of the wedding preparations. A romantic subplot seems to be in the offing when Kym recognizes the best man from Alcoholics Anonymous. They have sex, but the scene is every bit as perfunctory as their emotional connection. And in a resolutely unshowy comeback, Debra Winger practically backs into the movie as the sisters' mom, a stranger in another woman's household (both parents have remarried), reluctant to offer anything more holding than a smile. Kym is at the opposite pole. She complains about her dad's attention, but she's desperate for it too. She's a nightmare wedding guest, a time bomb waiting for the moment of maximum impact. Hathaway's terrific performance is a flurry of darting jabs and imagined slights. She's hypersensitive and utterly insensitive at the same time, her obvious smarts crushed under years of smarting. So what's her problem anyhow? There's the rub -- and the point where this fresh, lively picture falls in on itself. Without going into particulars, Kym is living with years of guilt. It spills out of her at the rehearsal dinner and washes over the room like toxic shock -- and it doesn't stop there. The whole movie is contaminated with the psychological fallout, the festering grievances, recriminations and jealousies. What a swell party this is! It doesn't help (or maybe it does) that the family is Well-heeled Connecticut with Artsy Associations. The film's score is supplied by live performances from various guests, many of whom will be familiar to fans of previous Jonathan Demme soundtracks. They include Robyn Hitchcock, "Sister" Carol East and a posse of Brazilian drummers. The bridegroom is Tunde Adebimpe, from TV on the Radio. The only surprise is that Neil Young doesn't show up. It's debatable whether all this music stalls "Rachel" in its tracks or serves as a welcome counterpoint to the finger-pointing. It's a bit of both, maybe. Nevertheless, it's disappointing that a movie so intent on immersing us in the moment should sink into such a swamp of back story and then -- in the sorry pop-psych tradition of "Ordinary People" -- lay the blame squarely on Mom. "Rachel Getting Married" could have done better than that. "Rachel Getting Married" is rated R and runs 111 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.

Obama to send U.S. ambassador back to SyriaStory Highlights Obama administration move signals reconciliation between two countries U.S. removed ambassador four years ago to protest killing of Lebanese leader Official: Move shows Obama "recognizes important role Syria plays in the region" Official said decision is not in related to the election crisis in Iran, a Syrian ally Next Article in Politics » By Elise Labott CNN State Department Producer	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama has decided to send a U.S. ambassador back to Syria, a dramatic sign of reconciliation between the two countries, the State Department announced Wednesday. Officials say President Barack Obama has not chosen an individual to serve as ambassador to Syria. State Department Spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters the Syrian government was notified of the decision Tuesday evening. "We're prepared to move forward with Syria to advance our interests through direct and continuing dialogue, " Kelly said. "We continue to have concerns about Syria's role in this region, and we think one way to address those concerns is to have an ambassador in Damascus." Kelly said the decision "reflects the administration's recognition of the important role Syria plays in the region." "We hope that they will continue to play such a constructive role to promote peace and stability in the region," Kelly said. Publicly officials say the decision, which was reported by CNN Tuesday, was not in any way related to the election crisis in Iran, although the Obama administration has maintained engaging the Syrian regime could weaken Syria's strategic alliance with Iran. "The timing is interesting," one senior State Department official acknowledged. "It's all part of the chess game." Syrian Ambassador to the United States Imad Moustapha said the decision reflects the genuine desire by the United States to reverse Bush administration policy and engage Syria., which he said would be good for both nations and for the region. Don't Miss Having ambassador "in our interests," official says
Envoy Mitchell to visit Syria
Senior administration officials say Obama has not chosen an individual to serve as ambassador. Once he does, the name must go through an informal vetting process with the Syrians before the president's choice is nominated and confirmed. The United States withdrew its ambassador from Syria four years ago in protest at the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Washington accuses Syria of being behind the killing of the popular statesman in a massive bombing that also left 22 others dead. Syria denies it, but an ongoing U.N. investigation has found indications of Syrian involvement. A charge d'affaires has been the highest-level American diplomat in Damascus since 2005. In anticipation of sending an ambassador back to Syria, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell recently traveled to Syria to examine the security situation there. The United States also is interested in building a new embassy in Damascus. The decision comes on the heels of a visit two weeks ago by Middle East envoy George Mitchell to Syria, where he said he had "serious and productive discussions" with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad about President Obama's goal of a "comprehensive peace," which includes peace between Israel and Syria, and Israel and Lebanon. "We intend to pursue this as vigorously as possible," Mitchell said. The visit was part of a series of actions between the two sides that could pave the way for dramatically improved ties. Last week U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, told reporters that "Syria has been taking some action" to stop the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq. Jeffrey Feltman -- an assistant secretary of state who is the department's top official on the Middle East -- and National Security Council official Daniel Shapiro traveled to Damascus twice in recent months in an effort to improve ties with Syria. The talks, which have been the start of more regular contacts between Washington and Damascus through normal diplomatic channels, focused in part on getting Syria to seal its border with Iraq. Washington has criticized Damascus for turning a blind eye to foreign fighters traveling through Syria into Iraq. Mitchell's recent visit took place on the heels of Obama's Cairo speech to the Muslim world, where he pledged to pursue a broad-based, comprehensive peace agreement in the region While Mitchell was in the region, Syria also hosted a delegation of U.S. military commanders in Damascus to discuss joint efforts to stem the insurgency in Iraq. "All of theses talks, the quality of the discussion and the level of engagement has been unprecedented, at least for the last eight years," Moustapha said The United States also wants Syrian support in achieving a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, and appears willing to nurture indirect peace talks between Syria and Israel, which began last year, over the disputed Golan Heights. Those talks were suspended after Israel's three-week offensive in the Gaza Strip that ended in mid-January. Damascus wants the United States to become involved if the talks resume. And the United States is interested in getting Damascus to use its influence with Hamas, which Syria views as a legitimate resistance movement and whose leaders take refuge in Syria.

Brett Favre helped the Vikings beat his old team Green Bay on Monday Favre also threw 271 yards and completed 24-of-312 passes without interception in the first meeting against his old Packers' teammates, to add to his stature as the all-time NFL pass leader. "It's sweet but it has nothing to do with revenge," Favre told reporters after the game. "I'm emotional but I'm always emotional. I knew there was a lot riding on the game. This one carried a little more weight. "One game does not define my career. I wasn't out to prove anything. I was out here to play. It was a lot of fun," Favre added. The 39-year-old, who is just shy of his 40th birthday, became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat every team in the league with the win and helped to put The Vikings equal with the New York Giants, New Orleans Saints, Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos on four wins from four games. Favre threw to Bernard Berrian for his third touchdown pass of the game to put his side 28-14 ahead. Don't Miss Packers to send Favre to New York Jets

Green Bay replied with a 14-play run to the Vikings one-yard line but on fourth down, a dropped pass in the end zone gave the momentum back to Minnesota. Minnesota's Jared Allen brought down Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the end zone for a safety to give a 30-14 lead to the Vikings, and despite a Green Bay rearguard, Vikings held on for the win. The sellout crowd at the Metrodome gave Favre a rousing welcome before the game, that saw the legendary quarterback play his former club of 16 sixteen years for the first time since joining the Vikings on August 18. In his time with the Packers, Favre helped the Wisconsin-based side capture the Super Bowl in 1996.

Feds warn drivers about auto loan modification scams
By Todd Sperry, CNN Senior Producer
updated 7:35 PM EDT, Thu April 5, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
FTC files charges against two California companies They are accused of charging hundreds in fees for auto loan modifications never performed Officials say fraud artists are going after consumers behind on their auto loans
Washington (CNN) -- After years of focusing on home mortgage scams, the Federal Trade Commission is turning its sights on what it calls bogus auto loan modifications. The FTC says fraud artists are moving from mortgage loan modification schemes and targeting consumers who are underwater on their auto loans.
In a motion filed in a U.S. District Court in California, the FTC asked the court to stop two California companies, "Auto Debt Consulting" and "Hope for Car Owners," from allegedly deceiving consumers. The government alleges both companies have racked up hundreds of dollars in up-front fees for loan modifications that were never performed for customers. Additionally, the FTC hopes to force the companies to cease what it says are deceptive marketing tactics.
Authorities allege the companies told customers to stop making payments on their vehicles, and in some cases told victims to "hide [their] car[s] to avoid repossession."
"Hope for Car Owners" made claims it could reduce monthly auto loan payments by up to 50% in return for fees ranging between $200 and $500, the FTC alleges.
Similarly, "Auto Debt Consulting" is accused of promoting that it could reduce monthly auto loan payments between 25% and 40% in exchange for $350 to $799 in fees.
Gregory Ashe, senior staff attorney for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC, said the agency is increasing its focus on the auto loan industry because, "We want the misrepresentation to stop." He added, "With these actions we want to stop the problem before it gets too big ... we're not going to tolerate deception."
But according to "Help for Car Owners" founder Patrick Freeman, the FTC's claims are "completely baseless." Freeman said he stopped using his company's website for marketing purposes in January 2011 and began the process of dissolving his company earlier this year. Since then, Freeman said he has been assisting customers who are in immediate danger of having their cars repossessed.
In 2008, as the U.S. economy plummeted, many people found their mortgages and auto loans in danger of default. Freeman said he started "Help for Car Owners" in an attempt to help customers keep their automobiles, and his success proved overwhelming, he said. In 2009, during the first months of business for "Help for Car Owners," he said he received more than 20,000 calls for help with delinquent auto loans. Freeman said, "In many cases people called me crying ... with the repo man at their door."
In January, Freeman said lenders were no longer willing to work with him. He began the processes of shuttering his business. Freeman said he shredded many of the documents he had supporting his claims. "We didn't destroy the documents, we got rid of them, it was a huge amount of files," Freeman said. He said the burden of being financially insolvent and having no place to store his company's files led him to destroy them. It's a claim he also made in court on Wednesday.
In the end, Freeman said he puts blame on clients who he said misled the FTC about their relationship with his company and didn't disclose contracts they had signed with "Help for Car Owners." Speaking about his customers, Freeman noted, "90% of my clients never saved a dime ... they manipulated the system for their gain." He also blames predatory collection tactics by lending companies who finance auto loans far exceeding borrowers' income.
Freeman told the judge on Wednesday that he intends to represent himself against the charges. The next hearing is scheduled for April 16. Freeman said he is broke and doesn't have money for an attorney, but he's not fearful of taking on the government by himself, saying he only wants to clear his name. As to the allegations levied against him, he said, "Ultimately, the FTC claims we made guarantees of loan modifications. We didn't, we made guarantees we would make every effort to facilitate the opportunity for assistance [with their car loans]."
A check of the Better Business Bureau's records showed that "Hope for Car Owners" gets a grade of "F," the BBB's lowest. "Auto Debt Consulting" received a "D-" with more than a dozen complaints on file.
Both companies are accused of violating the FTC act intended to protect cash-strapped consumers. So-called "last dollar scams" often involve bogus offers of easy moneymaking schemes that dupe uneducated and desperate customers.
CNN made multiple attempts to reach "Auto Debt Consulting" for this story but received no response.

Fiscal cliff talks still hung up on taxes
By Dana Bash and Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 9:48 AM EST, Thu December 13, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Speaker Boehner calls his talks with President Obama "deliberate" and "frank"
Source: Republicans still refuse Obama's call for higher tax rates on the top brackets House leaders say they will work until the end of the year for an agreement
Without a deal, the nation faces tax hikes and spending cuts on January 1
Washington (CNN) -- Public posturing or possible stalemate? Continued sniping by both sides in the fiscal cliff negotiations shows little movement on the core issue - higher taxes on the wealthy.
House Speaker John Boehner chose different language on Wednesday to describe his latest talks with President Barack Obama, calling a phone call the night before "deliberate" and "frank."
That contrasted to his use of "cordial" in labeling the previous discussion between the two men on Sunday.

Mother worried what no deal would mean
Such a seemingly minor shift can speak volumes in the roller-coaster reality of Washington brinksmanship.
Boehner clearly sought to indicate little progress in the negotiations on an agreement to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt.
However, the latest talks involved counteroffers by both sides that included two shifts by the White House. Democratic sources said Obama lowered his revenue demand from $1.6 trillion to $1.4 trillion, but also added changes to the corporate rate to his proposal involving income taxes.
No further details were available, but Boehner sounded unimpressed. He told reporters that Obama's latest stance remained far from a deal that he could accept or would win approval from the House and Senate.
"There were some offers that were exchanged back and forth yesterday," he said, adding that "the president and I had some pretty frank conversation about how far apart we are."
In particular, the Ohio Republican said that Obama's proposal failed to offer a balance between increased tax revenue and spending cuts promised by the president.
"In the five weeks since we've signaled our willingness to forge an agreement with the president, he's never put forth a plan that meets these standards," Boehner said. " And frankly, it's why we don't have an agreement today."

The White House and congressional Democrats rejected the Republican contention that the president's proposal lacked serious spending cuts and reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security as part of a comprehensive deal.
Instead, they said Republicans were the ones making inadequate offers instead of seeking real compromise by agreeing to Obama's demand to maintain current tax rates for most Americans while allowing an increase on the top two income brackets.
Obama has held a series of campaign-style public events to back his call for extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98% of Americans, with rates returning to higher 1990s levels on income over $250,000.
That would address the main concern of the fiscal cliff, a set of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will begin on January 1 without an agreement between Obama and Boehner.
Republican opposition in the face of support from the White House, Democrats and a majority of Americans, as shown by Obama's re-election and consistent poll results, showed GOP conservatives were holding hostage the continued tax cuts for the middle class to prevent higher rates on nation's wealthiest 2%, argued House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.
While Republicans have offered to increase tax revenue by eliminating some deductions and loopholes, they so far refuse to accept any increase in tax rates as demanded by the president.
Generals: Get real and cut Pentagon spending
A Democratic source told CNN that the latest Republican offer included extending all the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, including rates on the top income brackets.
According to the source, that signaled to Democrats that Boehner and Republicans were "unwilling or unable to do any sort of deal that can pass the Senate or be signed by the president."
Obama campaigned on higher taxes on the wealthy in winning re-election last month, and he and Democrats say Republicans must concede on that issue for an agreement to happen.
In an interview on Tuesday with ABC News, Obama said that he was "pretty confident" Republicans would relent on taxes in order to get a deal.
By the numbers: Fiscal cliff
At the same time, the White House complained Republicans have yet to offer details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue.
It was implausible for Republicans to contend that "we can somehow magically achieve significant revenue on the order that we need for that balanced deficit reduction package simply by closing loopholes that they will not name or capping deductions that they will not specify some time in the future," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.
"Those magic beans are just beans and that fairy dust is just dust," he added. "It is not serious and the president will not sign an extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest."
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said Wednesday that Republican talk is meaningless until they show a genuine commitment to include significant revenue in any agreement.
"The American people are not going to be under the illusion that the Republicans are sometime in the future going to come up with revenue," Reid said. "They are going to come up with raising the rates" or "we are going over" the fiscal cliff.
Homes, cars, jobs: Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff
Time is running out for an agreement on a short-term deal to avert the fiscal cliff and set up further negotiations in the new Congress that convenes in January or a more comprehensive approach that both sides say they want.
Without a deal, everyone's taxes go up and the government faces deep spending cuts, including for the military. However, the administration has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement next year.
The House is supposed to end its current session on Friday and go home for the year, but Majority Leader Eric Cantor made clear the chamber would stay later than planned.
"We are going to stay here right up to Christmas Eve, throughout the time and period before the New Year, because we want to make sure we resolve this in an acceptable way for the American people," Cantor said Wednesday.
With a deal needing time to be written into legislation and approved by Congress, the working deadline for an agreement this year is around Christmas Day at the latest.
Senator frustrated over 'secret process'
"You`re talking about having to have something done by Christmas, but the sooner the better," Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told MSNBC on Tuesday.
Polls consistently show the public favors Obama's stance in the negotiations.
Nearly half of Americans -- 49%--say they approve of the president's handling of the talks, compared to 25% who say Boehner is doing a good job, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday.
Meanwhile, a new Bloomberg National Poll indicated that nearly two-thirds of respondents, including nearly 50% of Republicans, believe Obama's re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy.
Also Wednesday, an administration official said the Business Roundtable --an association of CEOs of major corporations -- has dropped its opposition to raising tax rates on the top two tax brackets after lobbying by the White House.
Despite Boehner's adamant stance against such a tax rate hike, some cracks have appeared in his party's anti-tax facade, prompting a conservative backlash.
From my home to the House: How to fix the fiscal cliff
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, promised the newly re-elected Obama "one hell of a fight" next year if the president forces through his plan for high-income earners to pay more taxes without agreeing to substantive steps to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt.
"There will come a time in February and March where we have to raise the debt ceiling," Graham said Tuesday on "Piers Morgan Tonight" on CNN. "I will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms, because if we don't reform entitlements, we're going to become Greece."
Pelosi, however, argued Tuesday that more than $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by Congress in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations.
Is the tea party ready to deal on fiscal cliff?
Both sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue, but Obama also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets.
Republicans oppose the return to higher rates, saying it will inhibit job growth because small business owners declare their profits as personal income and therefore would face a tax increase.
In response, Obama and Democrats note that their plan -- already approved by the Senate and needing House approval to be signed into law by the president -- affects just 2% of taxpayers and 3% of small business owners.
While Republicans argue those small business owners account for about half of all business income, Democrats say that's because they include law firms, hedge funds traders and other high-income operations.
Retiring Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, predicted Tuesday on MSNBC that a deal would get worked out in a week's time.
"It would be wise on their part not to come too quickly with a deal because that would give all the interest groups a chance to get organized and try to kill it," Conrad said. "And we know that on the right, on the left, special interest groups are just salivating at the chance to attack any agreement because, look, any agreement is going to have controversy attached to it."
How will the 'fiscal cliff' affect you?
CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Deirdre Walsh, Jessica Yellin and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.

Middle East will muddle through 2013
By Aaron David Miller, Special to CNN
updated 8:51 AM EST, Fri December 28, 2012
Aaron Miller says a re-elected Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel will have no incentive to tackle tough issues with Palestinians.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Aaron Miller: Predictions for dramatic change in Middle East are likely to be wrong
He says 2013 will be a year when U.S. avoids military action against Iran's nuclear program
Progress on peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinians seems unlikely, he says
Miller: The lack of dramatic developments should be considered a positive
Editor's note: Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and served as a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. He is the author of the forthcoming book "Can America Have Another Great President?" Follow him on Twitter.
(CNN) -- Since leaving government almost a decade ago, my analysis of matters Middle Eastern has been, well, annoyingly negative.
And the reason? Best summed up in a line often attributed to Groucho Marx but actually uttered by Chico: "Well, who are you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
Aaron David Miller
What I see is an angry, broken, dysfunctional region that wants to transcend itself and resolve the conflicts that hold it back, but just can't. And I'm not at all sure there's a whole lot America -- that indispensable nation -- can do about it.
Here are my predictions for 2013 on some of the key issues. This year's theme is muddle through --neither breakthroughs nor breakdowns.
Iran: 2013 -- The so-called year of decision -- war with the mullahs who rule Iran or the grand bargain -- will produce neither. President Obama will go to extreme lengths to avoid a military strike aimed at Iran's nuclear program and will not greenlight an Israeli one. Without that go-ahead, the Israelis will continue to agonize but not act. And the mullahs will be smart enough not to brazenly give either Jerusalem or Washington an easy excuse to strike.
2013 will be a year of.... CNN Opinion contributors weigh in on what to expect in 2013. What do you think the year holds in store? Let us know @CNNOpinion on Twitter and Facebook/CNNOpinion
Bottom line -- 2013 will be a year of diplomacy, not war. To borrow a conceit from my friend New York Times reporter Elaine Sciolino, 2013 will witness the Tom and Jerry game in which cat and mouse in the old cartoon continue a never-ending game of almost gotcha. Who knows? If the Americans and Iranians try hard enough they might actually bump into one another and reach a limited deal to keep Iran a few more years away from getting enough uranium to make weapons. But if you're looking for final closure on this one, go talk to Dr. Phil.
Arab-Israeli peace: Panetta: A nuclear Iran is unacceptable
Palestinians get U.N. upgrade
Iran's assault on civil society
Syrian rebels: Defection will spark more
The sun, moon, and stars really aren't aligned on this one for a big breakthrough. Where should I start? The January 22 elections in Israel will likely produce another Netanyahu government that has no incentive to destroy itself politically by tackling the big issues like Jerusalem and refugees, certainly not with the Iranian nuclear issue still open. And the Islamists -- Hamas and Egypt's Mohamed Morsy (who can barely bring himself to talk about a two-state solution) aren't in the giving mood either. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is too weak to initiate much.
Bottom line -- The Americans will try and may succeed in getting the Israelis and Palestinians into a process to talk about borders and security. But the two-state solution is likely to remain too hard to achieve but too important to abandon. Persident Obama will probably not be earning his Nobel peace prize -- yet.
Arab spring/winter: This is going to be a long movie. After all, it took the United States a century and half and bloody civil war to even begin to reconcile the promise of equality contained wiithin the Declaration of Independence with the legitimization of slavery contained in the Constitution, and we're still not there yet.
Still, nowhere in the Arab world do the trend lines look that hopeful. Neither in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, let alone Syria, do the Arabs have the three elements required to set their experiment with democratization and pluralism in the right direction: leaders who put the nation before their own political and religious parties' interests, institutions that are seen as inclusive and legitimate, and a mechanism to ensure that polarization doesn't spill out into the streets in violence.
Bottom line -- Buckle your seatbelts. No immediate convulsions and catastrophes. But in the new Arab world with Islamists rising, the political space for the United States is going to get a whole lot smaller and the dangers to our diplomats much greater. The key question is at what point the bell will begin to toll for the kings and emirs in Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, too.
The good news: But all isn't totally gloomy. We're out of or getting out of the two longest wars in our history, we're reducing our dependence on Arab oil, al Qaeda has been weakened, and while we're not safe we're certainly safer here at home -- at least from foreign terrorists.
Bottom line -- With the notable exception of killing Osama bin Laden, President Obama hasn't had any spectacular successes in foreign policy, but more important, he has avoided spectacular failures. If he can continue to keep us out of trouble, particularly at a time when we need to be focused on repairing America's broken house rather than chasing around the lands of Araby trying to fix everybody else's, he'll have done pretty well. And who knows, if he's patient, maybe he'll even be able to turn one of those Middle Eastern migraines and root canals into an opportunity or two.

Rare 'Asian unicorn' caught on camera
By Brad Lendon, CNN
updated 9:10 AM EST, Thu November 14, 2013
A Saola is caught on camera for the first time in 15 years on September 7 in a forest in Vietnam. The species was discovered in 1992, and at most a few hundred -- and as few as a couple dozen -- of the animals are thought to exist. Because of its rarity and elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the "Asian unicorn." They are recognized by two parallel horns with sharp ends, which can reach 20 inches in length and are found on both males and females. A Javan rhino walks in the national park in the Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia. It is one of the most threatened of the five rhino species, with as few as 35 individuals surviving. Their skin has a number of loose folds, giving the appearance of armor plating. The discovery of three dead Javan rhinos in 2010 has intensified efforts to save one of the world's most endangered mammals from extinction. The Ganges River dolphin once lived in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna, Karnaphuli and Sangu rivers of Nepal, India and Bangladesh. But the species is extinct from most of its early distribution ranges. They can only live in freshwater and essentially are blind. They hunt by emitting ultrasonic sounds, which bounce off of fish and other prey, enabling them to "see" an image in their mind.
A strutting adult male greater sage-grouse is seen in Alberta, Canada. They were once found across 13 western U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. Because of oil and gas development, conversion of land for agricultural use, climate change and human development, they now only inhibit half their historic range. They are well known for their spectacular mating dances performed on mating grounds called "leks." A schoolboy reaches out to touch a humpheaded Maori wrasse as it swims in the world's largest Great Barrier Reef exhibit at the Sydney Aquarium in June 2003. It is an enormous coral reed fish—growing over 6 feet long — with a prominent bulge on its forehead. Some of them live to be over 30 years old. WWF urges local governments in the Coral Triangle to stop the trade and consumption of humphead wrasse, one of the most expensive live reef fishes in the world. A baby Buergers tree kangaroo appears out of her mother's pouch at the San Diego Zoo in January 2003 in San Diego, California. The endangered species of tree kangaroo is native to the lowland and mountainous rainforests in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They have adapted to life in the trees, with shorter legs and stronger forelimbs for climbing, giving them the appearance of a cross between a kangaroo and a lemur. The joey plays a critical role in the Tree Kangaroo Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that has worked to ensure the long-term survivability of the species since 1977. Black spider-monkeys — also known as the Guiana or red-faced spider monkey — are one of the main monkey species encountered in healthy tropical rainforests. It's prehensile tail allows this monkey to find stability when sitting on branches and to reach out for food at the tip of fragile branches by suspending himself.
A leatherback turtle goes to sea after burying eggs at the Matapica National Park. They are named for their shell, which is leather-like rather than hard. They are the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Although their distribution is wide, the number of these turtles has seriously declined during the past century as a result of intense egg collection and fisheries bycatch.
The rockhopper penguin is much smaller in size than the emperor penguin. Rockhopper penguins weigh less than 10 pounds. They were named for their distinctive hopping movements over the rocky hills and cliffs where they live and breed. In the past 30 years, it is estimated that the population of rockhoppers has fallen by nearly 25%, and now climate change could place them at even greater risk.
A bowhead whale swims under ice in the Arctic. Adult bowheads are entirely black except for the front part of the lower jaw, which is white and prominently upturned. They can grow up to 60 feet long while still being able to leap entirely out of water. Data show they may be among the longest-living animals on Earth. Based on the recovery of stone harpoon tips in their blubber, and from analysis of eye tissue, scientists believe that the life-span of bowhead whales can be more than 100 years.
The pronghorn antelope is the fastest hoofed animal in North America and is capable of reaching speeds up to 60 mph. Most pronghorn populations remain stable, but have experienced a historic decline. Pronghorn follow the same migration corridors year after year. Today, the thoroughfares that link the summer breeding grounds and winter grazing areas are being fragmented by roads, cities, fences and energy development. These fragmentations threaten the migratory routes and survival of pronghorn.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Saola caught on forest camera in Vietnam
At most, only a few hundred saola thought to exist
Species was first discovered in 1992
(CNN) -- Environmentalists in Vietnam were ebullient this week after remote cameras in a forest reserve snapped pictures of a live saola, one of the rarest large mammals on Earth.
At most a few hundred -- and as few as a couple dozen -- of the animals are thought to exist. Because of that rarity and its elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the "Asian unicorn." That moniker comes despite the fact it has two closely spaced parallel horns.
"These are the most important wild animal photographs taken in Asia, and perhaps the world, in at least the past decade," said William Robichaud, coordinator of the Saola Working Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, in a World Wildlife Fund press release.
Scientists discover new species in Australian rainforest
This Sept. 7, 2013 photo released by WWF, shows the Saola in a forest in Vietnam. "This is an historic moment in Vietnam's efforts to protect our extraordinary biodiversity," Dang Dinh Nguyen, deputy head of the country's Quang Nam Forest Protection Department, said in the release.
The picture of the animal was taken in September in a reserve in the Central Annamite Mountains and announced by the WWF on Tuesday.
441 species discovered in Amazon since 2010
Van Ngoc Thinh, WWF-Vietnam's country director, called the picture "a breath-taking discovery."
"When our team first looked at the photos we couldn't believe our eyes. Saola are the holy grail for Southeast Asian conservationists," Van said in a press release.
The saola, which is a relative of cattle but looks like an antelope, was first discovered in 1992 in forests along the Vietnam-Laos border. A WWF survey team found a skull of the animal in a hunter's home. In Vietnam, a saola was last seen in the wild in 1998. In Laos, a remote camera snapped a picture of one in the wild in 1999. And in 2010, Laotian villagers captured a saola that died before word got to researchers.
Olinguito: The newest rare mammal species
There are no saola in captivity.
Environmentalists said Wednesday the pictures show that efforts to save the saola are working.
"Saola are caught in wire snares set by hunters to catch other animals, such as deer and civets, which are largely destined for the lucrative illegal wildlife trade," Van said in the WWF release. "Since 2011, forest guard patrols ... have removed more than 30,000 snares from this critical saola habitat and destroyed more than 600 illegal hunters' camps."

Starr's Law Firm Begins An Inquiry
A Jones-related fax sparks an internal probe
By John King/CNN
WASHINGTON (Feb. 11) -- Sources at Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr's law firm confirm to CNN that an internal investigation is under way to determine if anyone at the firm did any legal work, formally or informally, related to the Paula Jones sexual harassment-civil rights case.
Any such work by Kirkland & Ellis lawyers could pose a conflict of
interest for Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
At issue is a document faxed from the firm's Chicago office to the
Chicago Tribune; the document was an affidavit that soon thereafter was filed in the Jones case.
Clinton attorney Robert Bennett was told about the episode by the
newspaper, and has since subpoenaed Kirkland & Ellis to determine what, if any, involvement it has in the Jones case. Two Kirkland & Ellis attorneys tell CNN there is an internal inquiry
underway. One of them confirmed a Tribune account that the focus was on Richard Porter, a Chicago-based partner who once worked as an "opposition researcher" for the 1992 Bush-Quayle presidential campaign. Porter did not return a telephone message seeking comment.
Sources say Kirkland & Ellis is fighting the Bennett subpoena.
Starr's office declined comment.
