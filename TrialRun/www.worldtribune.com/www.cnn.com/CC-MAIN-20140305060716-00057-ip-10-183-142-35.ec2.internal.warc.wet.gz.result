CHESAPEAKE, Virginia (CNN) -- For the first time since it was seized, officials Tuesday allowed the media to photograph the car that authorities say served as a sniper platform during the October 2002 Washington, D.C.-area killing spree.
CNN and other news organizations petitioned Judge Jane Marum Roush to allow access to the 1990 Chevrolet Caprice, which had been shown to jurors in the trials of John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo.
Muhammad's trial ended Monday when a Virginia Beach jury recommended the death penalty, a decision that Judge LeRoy F. Millette Jr. is likely to follow at the formal sentencing in February. (Full story)
Malvo's trial is on holiday recess following testimony Tuesday and will resume next Monday in Chesapeake, Virginia. (Latest developments)
Muhammad and Malvo were arrested on October 24, 2002 while sitting inside the Caprice at a Maryland rest stop.
When the car was seized during the arrest, a television news camera in a helicopter photographed it as it was being pushed into a garage for processing.
Since then, law enforcement officials have kept the car from view, covering it with tarps while transporting it to courthouses.
Investigators say the car was modified to turn it into a "killing machine." The rear seat of the car was hinged at the top, allowing a person to crawl into the trunk, and a small part of the trunk above the rear license plate was sawed out, possibly providing space for a rifle barrel. (Full story)
In addition, the inside of the trunk lid was partially spray-painted to create a light trap, making it more difficult to detect when the lid was cracked open. Investigators say the shooters partially opened the trunk lid before firing the shots.
At the Muhammad trial, a forensic expert told of various materials found inside the car after it had been confiscated. Included were a high-powered rifle, a laptop computer and books on history, politics and philosophy.

New Orleans' record on rebuilding firehouses: 0-22 Story Highlights City of New Orleans has yet to rebuild any of the 22 firehouses struck by Katrina Denis Leary's foundation has helped rebuild five fire stations Leary says he gave up on politicians working "to help these guys" Volunteer: "It was astounding to me that they haven't been helped" Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO MAP By Sean Callebs CNN NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans has yet to rebuild a single fire station more than two years after Katrina destroyed or damaged 22 of the city's 33 firehouses. Appalled by the city's lack of action, an actor is leading the way in reconstruction of the fire stations. Without city help, firefighters have resorted to repairing their stations along with volunteer carpenters. "I gave up on ever hoping that politicians in this country -- local, state or federal -- would step in to help these guys," actor Denis Leary told CNN. Leary, who stars as a firefighter on a TV show called "Rescue Me," is using his charitable foundation to bring together volunteers from a New York carpenter's union and the New Orleans Fire Department to rebuild the stations. So far, they've rebuilt five, with two more slated to be finished in a couple months. Leary says it's a sad commentary on society when actors and musicians become the key players in helping a city rebound. Brad Pitt, Harry Connick Jr. and U2's The Edge are among the stars helping out across New Orleans. See the desperate state of the firehouses » "We have The Edge, you know, an Irish musician coming over here to help solve the problems in New Orleans," he said. "But we can't get FEMA or our own president to respond. It's not shameful, it is just funny." He added, "I have so given up on ever getting a politician's head to turn and face facts in that situation." Watch Leary's rescue mission » After Katrina hit, FEMA estimated it would take 10 years and millions of dollars to rebuild the fire stations. In the interim, firefighters have been working and living in trailers attached to the decimated firehouses. "It's a bit heart-wrenching," said firefighter Chuck Brokmeier. Jerry Cremins, a member of the New York District Council of Carpenters, came down last year to pick his son up from Loyola University. He couldn't believe the devastation. "It doesn't translate that well on TV," Cremins said. Deciding he had the skills to help, Cremins reached out to Leary's firefighters foundation. Volunteers from the union are now working shoulder to shoulder with New Orleans firefighters. Cremins said he has made nine trips to New Orleans, all on his own dime and own time.

There's no question bringing fire stations back fosters a sense of pride, but he said some of the work has just been a nightmare. "It was astounding to me that they haven't been helped out -- that local governments and municipalities haven't held up their obligations," Cremins said. "That is basically when citizens have to step in and get the job done." Leary said some of the stories firefighters tell are almost unbelievable. He says a firefighter once told him about a station that had about three feet of water. "He said one of the guys from FEMA came in here and told us that they would pay for the hinge on this door below the water line, but the two hinges above the water line they weren't going to pay for," Leary said. Edward Blakely, the czar of New Orleans recovery effort, appreciates the work from Leary's foundation and volunteers. He said the city has been focusing on rebuilding its police headquarters to combat the growing crime problem. The police headquarters just recently reopened, now allowing the city to focus on the fire stations, Blakely said. "We say to the citizens: 'Look, we are going to have a better city. You don't want us to put it back just the way it was. You want us to improve it,' " Blakely said. "That's what we're going to do. That takes a little more time, but it's worth it." New Orleans is in a tough situation, according to Blakely. Under city law, he said, there has to be enough money in city coffers to pay for a project before construction starts. And because no construction firm is going to do the work before getting paid, Blakely added, funding projects has become a shell game of sorts since Katrina. It's frustrating to firefighters, and certainly taking its toll on morale. The fire gear they all wear is light sensitive, and is supposed to be stored in a dark locker to make sure the uniforms remain as fire resistant as possible. In a trailer, that just doesn't happen, said district chief Tim McConnell. He said there's no question the lack of rebuilding is a safety hazard. "The time it takes you to lock up a trailer, to get from there and get on the ... [fire truck], all that delays response time just a little bit," McConnell said. Firefighters are also quick to note that none of them abandoned their posts during Katrina. McConnell said his firefighters may not be happy, but you won't hear them complain. "I truly believe when people see the infrastructure being rebuilt, they will want to come back to the city," McConnell said. E-mail to a friend CNN's Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.

Will Prop 8 ruling have an impact on other states?By Ed Hornick, CNN Protesters make their case at an anti-Proposition 8 rally in east Los Angeles, California, on May 26, 2009. STORY HIGHLIGHTSU.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker to rule on Proposition 8 trialThe ballot initiative was approved by voters in California in 2008Legislative expert says no matter the ruling, states are unlikely to take up legislationThe ruling will likely be appealed to an appeals court and the Supreme Court Washington (CNN) -- While closing arguments have ended in California's Proposition 8 trial -- a case that will determine the constitutionality of California's same-sex marriage ban -- the outcome may not have an impact on states considering similar legislation. The reason: State budget crises and the upcoming elections have shifted the focus from social issues to fiscal stability, which will sidetrack same-sex marriage legislation in other states, a policy expert said. "I have also seen this issue pushed aside since the recession started. States are just so focused on budgets and the shortfalls," said Christine Nelson, a program director at the National Council of State Legislatures. "I had a legislator tell me 'Are you kidding? Our state needs money and job creation. So why in the world would we be tackling that?' " Nelson, who follows the issue of same-sex marriage, said there's been very little legislative activity this year, which she attributes to a year where most legislators are up for re-election. "I talked to advocates last fall and I said what are you expecting this session? And they said 'Oh, nothing, it's an election year' -- no one's going to touch these issues."

Proposition 8
Same-Sex Marriage
After California's Legislature approved same-sex marriages and the state Supreme Court ruled they were legal, voters in November 2008 passed Proposition 8, banning them. In May 2009, the state's highest court upheld the ban, but allowed about 18,000 unions performed before the ban to remain valid. Read more about Proposition 8 and same-sex marriage Nelson said that while there could be a flurry of action by activists as a result of District Court Judge Vaughn Walker's decision, she doesn't expect anything substantial or noteworthy to come about politically. "I don't see any real immediate response legislatively no matter what the Prop 8 decision looks like," she said. "In some cases, what legislators can do is start the ball rolling. But that doesn't necessarily mean that there's going to be any real immediate consequence to it." Five states and the District of Columbia allow for same-sex marriage. Other states have civil union laws. But for 30 states, Nelson said, it will be next to impossible to get legislation on the table because those states have the Defense of Marriage Act on the books. Enacted by Congress in 1996, the act bars federal recognition of same-sex marriage and allows states the right to do so. CNN Special Report: Gay in America Since 1996, several states have put into place legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages or "the recognition of same-sex marriages formed in another jurisdiction," according to the National Council of State Legislatures. The issue heated up in 2003 when Massachusetts' Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage. The decision led to a firestorm among conservatives and became an issue in the 2004 presidential election. Legal options The Proposition 8 case is being dubbed in legal circles as this generation's Brown v. Board of Education, the case that outlawed segregation in schools. It also closely echoes the Supreme Court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage. An appeal to the Supreme Court on the case is all but guaranteed by the losing side, but it would go first to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, considered the most liberal federal appeals court. An issue the defendants could use if the law is overturned is what legal standard was applied in the case. Maria Blanco, the executive director of the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity & Diversity at the University of California, Berkeley, said the court right now is looking at this as a rational basis test. Judges utilize this legal method to examine whether a law is arbitrary or had a reasonable and rational basis for being created. It is most often seen in cases where the plaintiffs claim their equal protection rights under the Constitution were taken away. "Let's say the plaintiffs survive and win [in this case] and they win on a rational basis, I'm sure the defendants would appeal and say they didn't meet the rational basis test ... or could appeal by saying the court used the wrong standard," she said. But even if the plaintiffs win, gays and lesbians might not yet be able to get married in the state. "There probably won't be an immediate impact. The first thing the defendants would do is to go to court to get a stay pending appeal. I'm pretty sure they'd get it." The fight over Proposition 8 has been a long and grueling struggle for advocates and opponents. "It does not weaken the fabric of our communities to grant them these basic familial rights -- it strengthens them," said Chad Griffin, president of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, when the lawsuit was announced in May. "It does not undermine marriage to extend it to these loving couples -- it affirms it." Andrew Pugno, a lawyer for Protect Marriage, the group that came up with Proposition 8, said he believed the issue was over when Californians went to the polls. "Seven million Californians voted to preserve or restore what marriage has meant since the beginning of time," he said. "If they're not permitted to do something as basic as that, then there's something, really something, wrong with our system."CNN's Mallory Simon, Dan Simon and William Mears contributed to this report.

Is drinking soda really that bad for you?
By Melina Jampolis, Special to CNN
updated 10:33 AM EDT, Fri May 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sugar sweetened beverage consumption has increased significantly Men consume on average 178 calories per day from sugar sweetened beverages
Soda often displaces more healthful items in the diet Editor's note: Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNN's diet and fitness expert, is a physician nutrition specialist and the author of "The Calendar Diet: A Month by Month Guide to Losing Weight While Living Your Life."
(CNN) -- Q: I've heard so much about the dangers of drinking soda. Is it really all that bad for you? Or is it just empty calories?
You may have heard about a new study published in the May issue of the American Journal of Nutrition that found an increased risk of stroke in people who consumed more than one soda per day.
These findings are not surprising in light of the growing body of evidence linking intake of sugar sweetened beverages -- of which soda makes up the largest percentage -- and diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and high cholesterol.
Sugar sweetened beverage consumption has increased significantly over the past several decades. Recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data found that half of the U.S. population consumes at least one sugar sweetened beverage on any given day. Men consume on average 178 calories per day from sugar sweetened beverages and women consume 103 calories per day.
Of particular concern in light of the current childhood obesity epidemic is the increased use in children, especially teens and young adults. Soda often displaces more healthful items in the diet and is a warning sign of a poor quality diet.
The dangers of soda extend beyond the increase in calories, although this is likely an important contributor to weight gain and obesity. Calories consumed in liquid form do not satisfy hunger as effectively as calories consumed in solid food form, so people often consume more total calories, which can lead to weight gain.
In addition, consuming large amounts of rapidly digested sugar and high fructose corn syrup causes a spike in blood sugar and insulin, which can lead to inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which may increase your risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer.
The large doses of fructose from both sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup may be particularly detrimental to your health as they can cause the accumulation of metabolically toxic belly fat, cholesterol abnormalities -- including high triglycerides and reduced levels of HDL (good cholesterol) -- and nonalcoholic associated fatty liver disease.
Soda is also associated with symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, when the contents of the stomach leak back up and cause a burning sensation in the esophagus. While drinking soda is not known to cause ulcers, it can cause symptoms to flare up.
The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 450 calories from sugar sweetened beverages per week (the amount in three cans of cola).
If you are overweight or obese, or at risk for heart disease or diabetes, you should limit your intake of sugar sweetened beverages as much as possible, including soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, juice drinks and sweetened water and/or tea.

Miners trapped in Zimbabwean platinum mine, officials say
By Columbus Mavhunga, For CNN
updated 12:11 PM EDT, Tue May 22, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The miners are all expected to be out later Tuesday, the company says
A union official said a conveyer belt caught fire
The mine is in Zvishavane, about 400 km south of Harare
Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Workers trapped by a fire overnight in a platinum mine in southern Zimbabwe are being brought to the surface Tuesday, a statement from the mine's owners said.
"All employees have been accounted for and no injuries have been reported. The majority of the workforce was evacuated following the incident," said the statement from Implats and Aquarius Platinum Ltd.
"Initially 75 employees were accommodated in refuge bays due to low visibility. They are now in the process of being moved to surface. This is expected to be completed during the course of the afternoon."
Earlier reports said as many as 85 miners were trapped at the Mimosa mine in Zvishavane.
An official with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) said the incident began Monday night after a bearing on a conveyer belt collapsed.
"The conveyer belt then caught fire. Some people have been rescued but some are still trapped underground. There are two ambulances with medical staff attending to those who have been brought to the ground," said the ZCTU official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the incident.
Mimosa mine officials could not be reached for comment.
The mine in Zvishavane, about 400 km (249 miles) south of Harare, is owned by South African mining giants Impala Platinum and Aquarius Platinum Ltd.

Jockey dies after fall at California track
By Melissa Abbey and Steve Almasy, CNN
updated 2:55 PM EDT, Sat July 7, 2012
Jockey Jorge Herrera died Thursday after being thrown from his horse during a race.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fair adds additional paramedic in ambulance
Racing resumes at track after moment of silence
Jockey Jorge Herrera fell when a horse clipped another horse and stumbled
Jockeying is the most dangerous sport, an official says; accidents kill about two jockeys a year
(CNN) -- Racing continued Friday at the northern California track where a jockey fell off his horse and later died.
Jorge Herrera, 33, died Thursday at Eden Trauma Center in Castro Valley from a head injury.
He was racing in his second event of the day at the track in Pleasanton when he was thrown from his horse, Morito, which appeared to clip the heels of another horse and stumble. Herrera lurched forward and went over Morito's head as the horse righted itself and continued.
"He was stepped on by either his horse or another horse and suffered severe head trauma," April Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the Alameda County Fair, told CNN affiliate KPIX. "We deeply mourn this loss today."
Mitchell told CNN that racing began at its usual time Friday, with a moment of silence after the national anthem. A memorial service was scheduled for Sunday, the last day of the three-week meet.
The racing death is the first since jockey Mark Villa died at a New Mexico track in September 2010 and is a stark reminder of the physical toll the sport can take.
Jockeying is the most dangerous job in sports based on the number of deaths and injuries, said Terry Meyocks, national manager for the Jockeys' Guild, based in Nicholasville, Kentucky.
Since 2007, there have been five deaths -- including Herrera -- and last year 19% of the active riding members of the guild were out on temporary disability. There are roughly 650 active riders in the guild.
Within the past month the guild has begun work on a jockey injury database, which looks not only at the number of injuries, but at the racing conditions and what gear the rider was wearing, Meyocks said. The goal is to find patterns that might help prevent injuries in the future.
Meyocks said there has been an average of about two jockey deaths per year in the United States -- 152 total -- since the guild started compiling a fatalities database in 1940.
An ambulance was following the horses and medical personnel responded immediately, a statement from the association said.
Fair CEO Rick Pickering said the event has five paramedics within 100 feet of the track. For the rest of the meet, an additional paramedic will join emergency medical technicians in an ambulance that follows the horses, he said.
The fair exceeds standards for responding to emergencies, Pickering said.
Herrera had 1,010 thoroughbred mounts and 55 victories in his career, according to equibase.com. He had been injured three times, Meyocks said. The guild is looking into what those injuries were.
Herrera was a quiet, polite man who generally kept to himself, said Darrell Haire, regional manager for the Jockeys' Guild.
"He was a nice kid; everybody liked him," he said. "Like a lot of riders he was trying to get started and get lucky. He didn't get the opportunities that a lot of guys get."
Haire said he thought Herrera, originally from Mexico, lived with an uncle.
It isn't uncommon for horses to clip heels during a race, Haire said.
"A lot of times when they clip heels they'll stumble, but when they clip just right they'll do a nose dive," he said. "It's like a crash. They just go down."
It also isn't uncommon for jockeys to fall, though usually they'll break collarbones and shoulders, or injure their backs, he said.
"And sometimes they die. A lot of people don't realize that," he said. "It's part of the game, part of the occupation."
A 2000 study by researchers at the University of North Carolina found 6,545 injuries among 2,700 riders during the four-year period of 1993 through 1996. While injuries that happened in or near the starting gate were the most prevalent (35 percent), the home stretch and finish line also were the site of many injuries. Nearly one in five accidents led to a head or neck injury, the researchers found.
Herrera's death came 37 years to the day after the last previous death of a jockey -- Juan Gonzalez -- in an accident at the track, which is about 30 miles southeast of Oakland.

Digital health for kids, seniors and workout buffs
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 5:44 PM EST, Thu January 10, 2013 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
The Fitbit Flex tracks steps, distance, calories and sleep and syncs with your smartphone. It is scheduled to ship in early spring.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
At the Consumer Electronics Show, there are 210 companies in the digital health area
Sensors are smaller, cheaper and can transmit data about your health to smartphone apps
New games and pedometers aimed at kids are the latest tools for fighting childhood obesity
Sensors to monitor the health of seniors and sick people share data with doctors, family
(CNN) -- Any pedometer will count how much you've walked, but a good, connected mobile app can push, encourage and sometimes even shame you into putting down the milkshake, getting out of the beanbag chair and meeting a fitness goal.
Sensors that record data about your fitness, daily routines, vital signs, weight or sleep habits have been around for years, but at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the spotlight is on devices that wirelessly sync data to the cloud and smartphone apps and how they use that information to effectively promote and maintain good health.
Digital health tech is a booming area at CES this year with 210 booths in the section reserved for health technology companies. It's a mixed bag of activity trackers, health insurance companies, smart scales, disease management tools and sports gadgets.
Wearable sensors have become smaller, cheaper and more powerful in the past few years. More recently, low-energy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth synching capabilities have made syncing to smartphones, cracking open a world of product possibilities.
On the show floor, sensors popped up in watches, wrist bands, belt clips, underwear and bra clips, in-ear headphones, fitness equipment and adhesive patches you wear on your skin. Many device makers said it was only a matter of time before they show up in everyday clothes, maybe even in your body.
Here are some ways health tech is helping people now:
Encouraging physical fitness The biggest booths are for the fitness trackers. Pedometers, devices that count steps and distance, have been around for hundreds of years; they were first introduced to the U.S. by Thomas Jefferson. But recent technology has inspired a digital resurgence for the lowly pedometer, with tricked-out new devices that also track calories, how many stairs you climb and sleeping patterns.
Fitness tracker company Fitbit unveiled its latest product, the Fitbit Flex, at CES. The $100 wristband comes in a variety of colors, is waterproof and has no display other than a tiny row of dots that light up. It automatically uploads data to your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Note II or Samsung Galaxy S III every 15 minutes. Once synched, the data is displayed on the app or website as colorful graphs, your progress charted and goals outlined.
The smartphone app acts as the hub for your Fitbit, as well as the company's Aria smart scale. If food is something you need help monitoring, you can keep detailed logs of your meals to calculate how many calories you've consumed.
"It's not about the numbers, but how you can be motivated," said Fitbit's Woody Scal.
Fitbit has integrated effective coaching and training tricks to keep users on track. For example, it can send encouraging or taunting text messages or e-mails and award badges, depending on what motivates you. It also acts as a little social network, letting you connect with and compete against friends.
WearIt's Open Android Smart Watch provides for sport, health and wellness monitoring as well as gaming.
The teeny Fitbug Orb fitness tracker also records steps and sleep, but this round device is designed to fit into an assortment of holders, including a watch band or underwear clip. It also has an app and online coaching services but will only cost $50 when it comes out this summer.
French company Withings debuted its newest smart scale at CES, the Smart Body Analyzer, which measures weight, body fat and your heart rate. A healthy home environment is important for health, so the scale tracks air quality, measuring Co2 levels and room temperature. The data is sent wirelessly to an iOS or Android device. The scale will be available in early 2013 and cost $150.
Keeping kids healthy
Can video games be used to keep kids healthy?
UnitedHealthcare, the largest health care provider in the U.S., thinks it's possible. According to the CDC, 17% of children and adolescents from 2 to 19 in the U.S. are obese. Investing in kids' health now and lowering that percentage could save all health insurance companies money down the line.
UnitedHealthcare just launched a test program in three schools using a popular video game to encourage exercise. It partnered with the makers of "Dance Dance Revolution" on a gym-class friendly version of the popular dancing game.
Up to 48 kids recreate the dances displayed on a large screen, while sensors in the wireless dance platforms record data about how well they are doing. The information is tracked over time and shared with the school, parents and the kid so everyone can see their progress. The idea is to make working out fun and gym class something to look forward to.
"We want to get it into areas where there are limited options for physical activity," explained Robert Plourde, the vice president of innovation and research and development at UnitedHealthcare.
The company is also working on an interesting beta project that turns an Xbox Kinect into a physical therapy coach. It counts reps and monitors the body's movements to ensure the exercises are being done properly.
The GeoPalz ibitz PowerKey activity tracker and paired mobile app are just for kids. The $50 pedometer, counts steps as "keys," which are points that can be collected to win prizes on Amazon, unlock game levels and earn badges. Parents can check in on their kids' progress on their own smartphones.
A headset that detects the brain's electrical activity is being used to improve children's mental health. NeuroSky's $149 Focus Pocus game, released last year, helps people with ADHD hone concentration and impulse control skills. Players don the a headset and place an attached sensor on their forehead, which can tell when they are concentrating or distracted. As they play the wizard-themed game, they are rewarded for focusing and completing tasks. Trials of the game saw improvement in concentration after a period of training.
More recently, Puzzlebox used the same technology to power a toy helicopter. Less therapeutic and more just cool, the Orbit flies up when you concentrate and can drop back down when you break concentration. The product, which started as a Kickstarter campaign, costs $189 and will begin shipping soon.
Monitoring the chronically ill and seniors Some of the most promising developments in the health tech area are for people with chronic issues such as heart failure, Parkinson's, hypertension or diabetes.
With the right sensors and apps, they can take a reading at home and transmit data to the cloud, where their doctors can monitor progress and look for red flags that they might miss during a short office visit.
Ideal Life's connected systems include small devices that measure blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rates and oxygen saturation, and it has a scale specifically for congestive heart failure patients. At CES, the company announced it was teaming up with ADT on an integrated alert system.
These remote health management services are appealing to hospitals, doctors and health programs because they can cut down on costly medical care by catching issues early and helping people avoid trips to the emergency room. But all that data being collected is valuable in other ways. Providers can amass the anonymous data for all patients to look for trends, assess programs and fine-tune treatment programs.
Having an outsider be notified of changes in health is also helpful for senior citizens living on their own. Instead of the classic emergency buttons worn around the neck, sensors can alert care givers to anything out of the ordinary. They don't even need to be health sensors. Connected home systems such as Lowe's Iris can be programed to send a text message when a senior doesn't do a regular activity such as opening the fridge or turning on a light.
A final smartphone-connected gadget for seniors (or anyone who takes a lot of pills) is the clever uBox. This round, functionally designed box reminds people when it's time to take their pills with a combination of beeps, blinking lights and smartphone reminders.
If they've already taken the pill for that time period, the box remains locked so anyone who is forgetful or suffering from dementia won't take a double dose. The uBox will notify family members or health care providers if a dose is skipped. The company, founded by MIT engineers, is raising money on Indiegogo.

Charles Ramsey: I'm no hero in freeing of captive women
See show times »
By Josh Levs, Phil Gast and Steve Almasy, CNN
updated 9:53 AM EDT, Thu May 9, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
I'm no hero, Charles Ramsey tells CNN
Charles Ramsey's 911 call: "She needs everything. She's in a panic, bro." His quick action freed three women and a girl allegedly held captive Ramsey works as a dishwasher at a local restaurant (CNN) -- Within hours of becoming a national hero, a viral video star and the top topic on Twitter, Charles Ramsey talked about having trouble getting sleep.
It wasn't because of all the excitement that followed his knocking down a Cleveland neighbor's door, freeing three women and a girl who police say were held hostage for years.
Instead, Ramsey told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, it was about knowing he had lived for a year near the captive women on the city's West Side.
"Up until yesterday the only thing that kept me from losing sleep was the lack of money," the restaurant dishwasher said on "Anderson Cooper 360."
Neighbor kicked in door to rescue women
Ramsey to 911: 'She's in a panic'
Women rescued after 10-year nightmare
Neighbor heard scream near Castro home
"I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff," said Ramsey. "Just do the right thing."
Ramsey recounted Monday night's drama, when he heard a girl scream "like a car had hit a kid."
He ran from his living room, clutching a half-eaten McDonald's Big Mac, to the house and helped free a woman identified as Amanda Berry.
"Amanda said, 'I've been trapped in here. He won't let me out. It's me and my baby."
Who are the three women freed in Cleveland?
Ramsey and a man named Angel Cordero broke down the door, CNN affiliate WEWS reported in an earlier interview heard around the world.
Ramsey told CNN he had never seen Berry before Monday, and at first, he could not place the name.
"Berry didn't register with me until I was on the phone, like wait a minute, I thought this girl was dead."
"She's like, 'This (expletive) kidnapped me and my daughter,'" he told the 911 operator, according to WEWS.
Why the Web loves Ramsey
After police arrived, Berry explained there were other women inside. When police came out with them, Ramsey told the station, "it was astonishing."
Berry was last seen after finishing her shift at a Burger King in Cleveland in 2003 on the eve of her 17th birthday.
The other two women are Georgina "Gina" DeJesus, who disappeared at age 14 in 2004, and Michelle Knight, who vanished in August 2002, at age 21, according to police.
Ramsey told CNN he is no hero and should not receive any reward.
"You've got to put that being a coward and 'I don't want to get in nobody's business,'" he said. "You got to put that away for a minute."
'I barbecue with this dude'
While Ramsey's quick action in the largely rundown neighborhood made him a hero, his colorful descriptions to WEWS helped make him dream fodder for the Twitterverse.
Explaining that he had no idea Ariel Castro, his neighbor, may have had other people inside his home, Ramsey said, "I've been here a year. You see where I'm coming from? I barbecue with this dude. We eat ribs and whatnot and listen to salsa music...
"He just comes out to his backyard, plays with the dogs, tinkers with his cars and motorcycles, goes back in the house. So he's somebody you look, then look away. He's not doing anything but the average stuff. You see what I'm saying? There's nothing exciting about him. Well, until today."
Castro "got some big testicles to pull this off, bro," Ramsey told WEWS. "Because we see this dude every day. I mean every day."
There's nothing exciting about him. Well, until today.Charles Ramsey, neighbor
He added, "I knew something was wrong when a little, pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms. Something is wrong here. Dead giveaway."
In one of the top tweets about Ramsey, comedian Patton Oswalt wrote, "Dear Charles Ramsey: I am not a little pretty white girl, but I totally want to run into your black arms. #hero."
Hodge's restaurant in Cleveland posted a message on Facebook saying, "we're extremely proud of our employee Charles Ramsey for not turning his back on the young women. He's a true Cleveland hero. Our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with the women, their families and their friends."

Restaurant owner Chris Hodgson told CNN that Ramsey goes above and beyond in his duties.
"You give him something to do, and he'll do more," he said. "We always look forward to seeing him, because you know he's gonna bring a smile to your face."
Hodgson said people have offered to raise money for Ramsey, but the employee would end up giving it to the victims and their families.
The company is working with other restaurants to plan fund-raisers for the families, Hodgson said.
For its part, McDonald's Corp., on its Twitter account Tuesday, said, "Way to go Charles Ramsey -- we'll be in touch."
Despite his assertions, Ramsey and Berry were praised as heroes by John Walsh, former host of TV's "America's Most Wanted."
At an awards dinner for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, Walsh said he called Ramsey on Tuesday to tell him that.
"You are the guy who decided in 30 seconds to go up and spring a woman from a house of hell that she's been in and was desperate to get out that door with her 6-year-old daughter," Walsh recalled saying.
Ramsey said he was raised to help women in distress, said Walsh.
Ramsey interview goes viral, gets autotune treatment
Breathless 911 call
Ramsey's demeanor comes across clearly in his 911 call.
"Hey bro," Ramsey tells the 911 operator. "Check this out. I just came from McDonald's right? So I'm on my porch eating my little food, right? This broad is trying to break out the f-----g house next door to me, so there's a bunch of people on the street right now and s--t. So we're like, 'What's wrong, what's the problem?' She's like, 'This m--------r done kidnapped me and my daughter ... She said her name is Linda Berry or some s--t. I don't know who the f--k that is, I just moved over here, bro. You know what I mean?"
He then answers the 911 operator's questions about the woman, what she looks like, and what she's wearing.
Ramsey tells the operator an address which he says corresponds to Berry's location, not Ramsey's home address. "I'm smarter than that, bro. I'm telling you where the crime was, not my house," he says.
"Are the people that she said did this, are they still in the house?" the 911 operator asks.
"I don't have a f-----g clue, bro. Like I said, I just came from McDonald's."
The operator then asks him to check whether Berry needs an ambulance.
"She needs everything. She's in a panic, bro. She's been kidnapped, so, you know, put yourself in her shoes."
"We'll send the police out," the operator responds.

Report: Ethics troubles complicated Christie's chances for 2012 ticket
By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN
updated 4:02 PM EDT, Fri November 1, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Concerns included investigation of Christie's travel expenditures while U.S. attorney. Revelation included in new book by reporters on presidential campaign, "Double Down" Christie faces New Jersey voters next week in gubernatorial reelection bid
Book also says Obama campaign conducted focus groups, polling about replacing Biden with Clinton
Washington (CNN) -- Ethics troubles complicated New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's chances of becoming Mitt Romney's running mate last year, The New York Times reports is in an upcoming chronicle of the 2012 presidential campaign.
The Times reported that too many questions remained after Christie completed the vetting process and Romney had lingering concerns.
The details come four days before New Jersey voters head to the polls to determine if Christie gets a second term.
During a campaign stop Friday, he dismissed the report and told CNN that the authors are "just trying to sell books."
Christie's challenges were first reported Thursday night by Times national political correspondent Johnathan Martin and based on details of the book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The highly anticipated book about the presidential election by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, is expected to be a juicy tell-all about the inner-workings of the presidential campaign.
Those concerns included a Justice Department investigation of Christie's expenditures while he was a U.S. Attorney in New Jersey.
A 2010 report by the department's Inspector General concluded Christie — among five top prosecutors investigated -- was the "the U.S. attorney who most often exceeded the government (travel expense) rate without adequate justification."
He also offered "insufficient, inaccurate or no justification" for most of those costs, and refused to meet personally with investigators about the discrepancies.
Christie was not identified by name in the government report, but government sources have said he was "U.S. Attorney C," CNN confirmed.
Romney adviser Beth Myers, who ran Romney's vice presidential search committee, told CNN that "Governor Christie complied fully with the Romney campaign's request for documents in a timely manner, including a complete medical report from his internist and cardiologist."
Romney ultimately chose Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate.
Biden vs. Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers may have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, but White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that it was never a remote possibility.
"Campaigns and pollsters test a lot of things," he told reporters at the daily White House briefing. "What I can tell you without a doubt is that the President never considered that and if anyone brought that to him, he would have laughed it out of the room, would never take it seriously."
Carney earlier told CNN's "New Day" that he knew "for a fact" Obama never considered it, later saying the idea was never brought to him.
He answered affirmatively when asked if Obama thought Biden would be a strong chief executive, saying that he had been an asset to the President in two campaigns and throughout the administration.
"Sure. I think the President picked Joe Biden as his running mate for the right reason, which is, if necessary, the vice president could be president. That's the first item on your checklist when you're picking your running mate," Carney said at the White House.
Asked about sizing up the potential Republican presidential field, Carney replied, "I think they all ought to run. It would be awesome."
Bill Daley, who was then Obama's chief of staff, said the swap wasn't necessary.
No one "thought that that was a good idea or needed to be done or should be done," Daley said on "CBS This Morning."
The Times obtained a copy of the book and reported that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.
The book says Daley spearheaded the effort, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."
Daley pushed back on the notion.
"Not for a moment was there a serious discussion or a belief that Joe Biden should be replaced, period," said Daley, a CBS contributor.
A difficult political year
Like Carney said, Daley admitted that it was something he considered and that polling and research were done to explore the possibility because it was his job to "look outside the box."
"But in 2011," Daley said, "it was a very difficult political year, and so my sense was we ought to look at everything here because this is a very -- it was a very difficult period, politically."
Polls conducted by CNN at the time showed that the President was struggling politically a year out from Election Day 2012. In the late summer and fall of 2011, Obama's approval ratings hovered around 45%, a 10-point drop from January of that year.
There was much speculation over whether Biden would be on a second-term ticket in late 2011 and early 2012.
Wolf Blitzer wrote on CNN.com in October 2011 that White House sources told him that the President was "very high" on Biden and "deeply appreciates his advice."
He said he asked Clinton, then Secretary of State, if it was something she would consider but she said, "No."
Obama's former deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, told CNN's Erin Burnett in January 2012, "Even privately, President Obama would tell you that one of the best decisions he's ever made in politics was putting Vice President Biden on his ticket."
"He's not leaving the ticket," Burton added.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times' national political correspondent, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely Daley, to measure what effect swapping Clinton for Biden would have on the polls.
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.
Messina, Plouffe and Axelrod took to Twitter to push back on the report.
Plouffe denied the White House or the campaign ever contemplated the swap.
"Never any consideration of (Biden-for-Clinton) switch," Plouffe wrote in a tweet.
The move was "not ever entertained by the only person who mattered. Or most of us. Back to Halloween," he added.
Axelrod tweeted: "VP swap never in play. Biden's taken on many tough assignments. He's been loyal friend and wise counselor. POTUS lucky to have him," Axelrod wrote Friday.
And Messina said: "Let me be clear: VP-HRC switch never considered by POTUS or anyone who mattered in the campaign. #sillyseason"
A significant investment
But Martin pointed out that it was, in fact, considered.
Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.
"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," he said on CNN's "AC360."
He said on the program that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle. While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.
As to whether Clinton knew, Daley said on CBS that if she did know, she "didn't find out from me."
CNN's Evan Perez, Bill Mears, Peter Hamby, Paul Steinhauser and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.
