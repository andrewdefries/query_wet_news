(SPACE.com) -- A committee of experts told NASA today that it should not give up on the idea of a space shuttle mission to service and improve the Hubble Space Telescope.Under the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, a blue-ribbon group has been looking into the future of the orbiting telescope based on a request by NASA.The committee is led by Louis Lanzerotti, a space scientist and consultant. The committee is reviewing various options for servicing Hubble with a crew of astronauts or with a robotic mission.SPACE.com obtained a copy of the study group's interim report earlier today. The document was officially released in late afternoon.NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said in January that the planned servicing mission would be cancelled due to findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, or CAIB. The CAIB had rooted out both bureaucratic and technical issues that led to the tragic loss of Columbia and its crew early last year.Under pressure from politicians and astronomers, O'Keefe agreed to have the Hubble servicing decision reviewed and has since said he might consider a robotic mission.Today's release of the study panel's interim report issued by the National Academies cautions that the technology and expertise needed for a robotic mission are both in infant stages. Yet four previous manned servicing missions to Hubble were "highly successful," the group points out. It finds that there are no safety procedures required by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that would absolutely prevent a shuttle mission to the orbiting telescope.The 20-member group recommends further study before anything is ruled out."NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope," the report concludes.Open and candidThe report was made by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope. It includes retired NASA and Air Force personnel, as well as astronomers, robot specialists, and space industry experts.In a telephone briefing with reporters today, Lanzerotti said NASA's O'Keefe has been "open and candid" with the committee. "We think that he will find our findings and recommendations of value to the agency."Pressed by reporters about any fissure between the interim report's views and O'Keefe's repeated statements that flying humans to the Hubble is now deemed too risky, Lanzerotti stated: "I do not think that the committee necessarily sees a gap between our report and the administrator.""The uncertain current status of the shuttle return to flight as well as uncertainties in the early stages of development of the robotic mission lead us to believe that the key technical decision points are at least a year in the future," Lanzerotti said. "Keeping both options open would be a prudent direction for the agency to take," he added."We are not saying sit on ones hands for the next year at all. We're saying precede vigorously with the development activities for a robotic mission. But at the same time do not preclude a space shuttle servicing to the Hubble," Lanzerotti told reporters in a teleconference.Robot experimentsIn order to beef up NASA's thinking about the practicality of Hubble robotic servicing, Lanzerotti said the space agency "should perhaps have a more active partnership role" in two space experiments now on the books.Those tests are the XSS-11, sponsored by U.S. Air Force. The other experiment -- Orbital Express/DART -- is led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).Lanzerotti said those in-space demonstrations could be made more directly relatable to Hubble servicing.The interim report states "there has been little time for NASA to evaluate and understand the technical and schedule limitations of robotic servicing."Battery situationLanzerotti said the committee was unanimous in backing the interim report findings, but noted: "We will be continuing with that fact-finding as the committee goes forward."The committee expects to issue its final recommendations by fall. The interim report was prepared because the committee members felt it necessary to respond to an urgency expressed by O'Keefe and other NASA officials.If a robotic mission is to be undertaken, experts have said, planning must start soon. Hubble's batteries and pointing gyroscopes must be replaced, or the observatory will likely become inoperable by 2008, possibly sooner."You never know about batteries," Lanzerotti stated. The expected life of Hubble's batteries range from 13 years to 17 years, he said, "and we're getting to that point.""One has to handle the battery situation such that, eventually, Hubble does not go into a mode where it becomes totally unusable and cannot even be rescued for deorbit at the end of its mission," Lanzerotti explained.Increase Hubble's efficiencyThe previously planned servicing mission by a shuttle crew would also have installed two new instruments on Hubble. Both are built and ready for use. The Wide Field Camera-3 (WFC3) would increase Hubble's efficiency for ultraviolet and near-infrared imaging by factors of 10 to 30, the committee reports. A Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) would increase Hubble's speed for some ultraviolet observations by at least 10 to 30 times.Other astronomers have said the new instruments, along with fresh batteries and gyroscopes, would insure Hubble would remain one of the world's most vital telescope for years to come. No replacement observatories for many of Hubble's important skills are planned for anytime prior to 2012."The committee urges that NASA commit to a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope that accomplishes the objectives of the originally planned SM-4 mission," including both repairs and the addition of the new instruments, the report states, adding that the "riveting" returns of science from Hubble "are far from their natural end."Good news for astronomersThe non-binding recommendations are good news for astronomers."I'm delighted that such an array of experts in all aspects of science and engineering agree that the Hubble Space Telescope should be maintained for the future," said Steven Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates Hubble for NASA."They have identified two viable ways for NASA to service Hubble, and it's my hope that NASA will find some way to keep the telescope at the scientific forefront for years to come," Beckwith said in a telephone interview.Catherine Pilachowski, past president of the American Astronomical Society, is encouraged by the report, especially the urging that both new instruments be installed. Industry analysts have said the installations might be particularly challenging in a robotic effort.Pilachowski said that the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph is "desperately important" to the astronomy community. It would help researchers map out the makeup of the universe in corners hitherto unseen.She is less concerned whether robots or people do the installation. "I want to see it happen, one way or the other," she said. "I think that's true for astronomers in general."

(CNN) -- Hopes of finding the thousands still missing from last week's massive earthquake and deadly tsunami glimmers weakly as desperately needed aid finally reached areas that had been cut off by the devastation.The death toll from Malaysia to East Africa stands at more than 155,000, after Indonesia's toll was raised by 14,000 to more than 94,000 early Monday by the country's health ministry.Tens of thousands are still missing -- including many tourists whose vacations took an unexpected turn early on the morning of December 26.And the area keeps shaking. Dozens of aftershocks have followed the 9.0 magnitude earthquake -- the strongest on the planet since 1964 -- including more than 15 with a magnitude of 5.0 or higher since Friday morning.The largest number of deaths in Indonesia, closest to the epicenter of the initial earthquake, were in its remote Aceh province -- home to a long-standing armed separatist movement that aid workers worry might complicate providing relief to victims.But CNN's Mike Chinoy reports that the recovery effort in Aceh, after a slow start, is becoming more organized, with more armed forces and aid workers making their way to the capital, Banda Aceh, and then into the province's more remote areas.Locals, too, are becoming more organized, Chinoy said, particularly in recovering bodies still buried beneath tonness of rubble.One resident told Chinoy it could take up to four months to find all those killed in Banda Aceh.It may be worse in the rest of the province. Nothing remained of the bridge connecting Banda Aceh and the west coast -- just 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the epicenter -- except the low pillars that once held the roadway.An Indonesian army garrison at the bridge was devastated -- of the 270 soldiers and their families stationed there, only 12 people survivied.Where there were survivors, they swarmed military helicopters -- the only transportation that could reach most of the areas -- bringing packages of food, water and medical supplies.Authorities set up a staging ground at the Banda Aceh airport where Australian C-130s and Indonesian military planes were bringing in supplies. U.S. helicopters from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln picked up the packages from there.The United States also sent helicopters to Sri Lanka, where more than 46,000 people are dead and more than 24,000 others are are missing.India's navy launched its largest relief operation, part of a $25 million effort to help Sri Lanka. Eleven Indian ships were dispatched to the island nation and military helicopters also ferried in relief supplies. Already, India has delivered six tonnes of supplies to the tsunami-hit areas and plans to ship in 20 tonnes more.In addition to relief supplies, India is sending engineers and skilled workers to help rebuild Sri Lanka's devastated economy.India itself was hit hard by the tsunami, with at least 9,500 people dead, most on its east coast and in the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, closer to Thailand and Indonesia than their mother country.Madhusree Mukerjee, an Indonesian journalist and expert on the indigenous peoples of the islands, said the Andamans -- the northernmost of the islands -- "suffered property damage but little loss of life.""The real devastation is in the Nicobar Islands," she told CNN.Indian officials report more than 5,400 people missing on the islands. Mukerjee said the population of the Nicobar Islands is about 45,000 and the tsunamis "washed over many of the Nicobar Islands many times."In one, Car Nicobar, which is also home to an Indian Air Force base, "we have been told all 15 villages have been washed out," she said.Mukerjee said the Indian government -- which declined international aid, saying it could handle the emergency itself -- was doing as good a job as could be expected. But she said Andaman and Nicobar could have benefited from assistance from the much closer Thailand, which also declined international financial aid.Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra told CNN that his country did not need the financial aid but was appreciative of expertise and equipment.Shinawatra said he was pleased to see cooperation between the private and public sectors -- and how fast the area "came back to normal activity."Owners of hotels that survived the tsunami in Phuket, for example, are encouraging vacationers to return -- and some are. The owners say the return of the tourists is essential to their survival.Some 70 percent of the hotels' reservations have cancelled, officials said.But CNN's Aneesh Raman said the juxtaposition of tourists on the beach where thousands died a week ago was odd, as was watching relatively normal beach activities while knowing hundreds of thousands elsewhere were in desperate need of aid.Jan Egeland, the U.N.'s emergency relief coordinator, said 1.8 million people needed food assistance across the affected area, adding that the number might rise further. The World Health Program, he said, had estimated it would take it three days to set up a food distribution program to reach all those who needed it in Sri Lanka and longer still in Indonesia."However, air drops are being undertaken," Egeland said Sunday."It is the first, crude way to get food there. It is not, however, a good way to get water and medicine distributed."Egeland said U.N. efforts were focused on Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Maldives and Somalia, and that other governments had said they were able to handle the disaster themselves.The effort is proceeding under rising fears of disease -- and the possibility of thousands more deaths."I am very worried about it," Egeland told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer." "Already the incidence of diarhea is up among children."So far, Egeland said, more than $2 billion has been pledged toward the emergency relief effort, an amount Egeland said was larger than what was pledged for all other humanitarian emergencies combined in 2004.But it still fell short of the $3.3 billion the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency provided Florida after four hurricanes struck the state last year.Japan is the largest contributor, pledging $500 million; the United States was second, with $350 million committed. (Contributions by country)U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has said that figure might not be "the end number," left Sunday to visit the region, accompanied by U.S. President George W. Bush's brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and other U.S. officials. (Full story)U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will also visit affected areas after the conference, but Egeland said his itinerary, other than Aceh on January 7, was incomplete. (Full story)As relief supplies began reaching survivors, a World Health Organization official said the primary concern now was to provide clean water and proper sanitation. "Given the very difficult conditions in which people are now living, it seems very, very likely that we're going to get some increases in disease and therefore death," said Dr. David Nabarro, executive director of Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments for the WHO. CNN's Mike Chinoy in Banda Aceh, Indonesia; Atika Shubert in Medan, Indonesia; Satinder Bindra in Galle, Sri Lanka and Aneesh Raman in Phuket, Thailand, contributed to this report.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Barbecue, Bible and Abe chase racism from Mississippi rib jointStory Highlights One of the oldest restaurants in Mississippi defied segregation Abe's BBQ in Clarksdale was founded by Lebanese immigrant Abraham Davis "We knew how the blacks must've felt," says son Pat Davis Long-time worker: Abe's is symbol of great barbecue and the civil rights struggle Next Article in Travel » Read PHOTOS By Wayne Drash CNN CLARKSDALE, Mississippi (CNN) -- Pat Davis was just 10 years old when two black men came into his father's barbecue joint in the heart of the Mississippi Delta in 1947. A huge fuss ensued, with four racists shouting every name in the book. Pat Davis operates Abe's BBQ. His father was a Lebanese immigrant in Mississippi and defied segregation.more photos » "My daddy went over to their table and said, 'These are people who want to eat just like you want to eat. You don't bother them. You leave them alone,' " Davis says, the incident seared in his mind six decades later. "They told Daddy he could lose his business by letting black people come in." It's not unusual to find a barbecue restaurant in the South where the ribs are so good you want to run home and kiss your mom. But it's a rare find to discover the South's main delicacy cooked up by Lebanese immigrants in Mississippi, who defied segregation and who've been doing it since 1924. Welcome to Abe's BBQ, a living testament to good eats and to good people, where civil rights were put to the test and won. In the end, racism took a back seat to slow-cooked pit barbecue. Today, Abe's remains one of the oldest restaurants in Mississippi. Step inside, view photos of Abe's » It's named after founder Abraham Davis, who arrived in Mississippi from Lebanon in 1913 when he was 13 years old. Abe's sits at The Crossroads, the landmark spot at Highways 49 and 61 in Clarksdale where legend has it that blues king Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil. Two giant guitars jut into the sky marking the spot where the deal went down. You might be pausing here. Lebanese in Mississippi? Defying segregation? Sounds like something out of William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. IF YOU GO ...If you visit Clarksdale, Mississippi: Abe's BBQLocated at The Crossroads of Highways 49 and 61 Rest Haven Restaurant 419 State St.  Delta Blues Museum 1 Blues Alley  Ground Zero Blues Club 0 Blues Alley  Shack Up Inn 001 Commissary Circle As you sit down with a platter of ribs this Labor Day weekend, this is one barbecue story you might enjoy over cole slaw, baked beans and beer. The town of Clarksdale is located about 70 miles southwest of Memphis, Tennessee, with a population of about 20,000 people. It was once known as the "Golden Buckle in the Cotton Belt," complete with Lebanese, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrants along with local blacks and white plantation owners. Much of the immigrant population has moved on. The town these days is perhaps best known for the Delta Blues Museum and for the nearby Ground Zero Blues Club, co-owned by actor Morgan Freeman. Blues purists may point you around the corner to Red's juke joint, a ramshackle place where raw Delta blues oozes from the walls. On this night, Eli Paperboy Reed and the True Loves brought the house down. But it's Abe's that has stood the test of time. Abraham Davis started his pit barbecue as the Bungalow Inn in 1924. It moved to its current location around 1936, and Pat Davis renamed it after his father in 1960. Davis says being an immigrant -- or in his case, the son of immigrants -- gives one a better respect for all people. "It was a humbling feeling, and we knew how the blacks must've felt," he says. "Being Lebanese, my parents weren't truly accepted as first-class citizens when they first got here." Andrew Clark, a 58-year-old African-American, worked at Abe's from 1962 to 1990, beginning when he was 16. He says Abe's is a symbol of great barbecue and a shrine to the civil rights struggle. "They didn't see us as colored. They saw us customers," Clark says. "It didn't matter whether you were white or black ... I never seen them turn down anyone." Sometimes he'd hear racist comments from white customers. When that happened, Pat Davis always stepped in. "The whole family is really, really great people," Clark says. "This place really has good roots to it." Don't Miss Abe's BBQ

Pat Davis refers to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as a prophet, "because any time you change things for the better, you've got to come from God." He says change didn't come easy. Many of the local blacks, he says, didn't want his family to be harmed, so they often followed segregation laws. It was when blacks from out of town came that things began to change. "They would come through the front and inside," he says. "My daddy never refused anyone no matter what color, race or religion. That's my philosophy as well." He says his father, who always carried a Bible written in Arabic, was "just doing the right thing." A hand-painted mural on the wall of Abe's depicts a pig with a fiddle in his hand, a pork sandwich and beer at his side. The hog is grinning from ear to ear, much like Abe's faithful customers over the years. "He's satisfied even though he's eating one of his kinfolks," Davis says with a chuckle. If you're in Clarksdale but not in the mood for barbecue (something's wrong with you, if so), then you'll want to head just up the road to an even more authentic Lebanese restaurant. Rest Haven dishes out kibbe, grape leaves and a host of other Lebanese delicacies, along with traditional American cuisine. Chafik Chamoun, a first generation Lebanese-American, established Rest Haven in 1954. Like Abe's, Chamoun says he has always welcomed people of all races. He peddled wares to black workers on plantations when he arrived in the United States, and learned to see past skin color at an early age. "I made a living with the black people all my life," he says. "I never refused one of them." "Most people tell me how glad they are that I serve them, that my business is here," says Chamoun, 75. I pause and tell Davis and Chamoun that stories like theirs aren't celebrated enough in Mississippi, that "all we hear about is bad sh--" coming from these parts. The men burst into laughter. They nod with approval. They say their message is one of love, honor and respect. And, oh yeah, one more thing: Great food.

Scientist: My quake prediction was ignoredStory Highlights Scientist says his warning of a quake in L'Aquila was ignored Gioacchino Giuliani says his system for monitoring radon predicts quakes Giuliani demands apology from authorities Next Article in World » Read VIDEO PHOTOS MAP L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- A researcher says he predicted Monday's devastating earthquake that killed dozens of people and left tens of thousands homeless in central Italy, but authorities dismissed him as a scaremonger. Rescue workers search for survivors in the ruins of a collapsed house in L'Aquila, Italy.more photos » Gioacchino Giuliani, an employee at a physics institute at Gran Sasso, near the badly-hit city of L'Aquila, has demanded an official apology for what he says was an unforgivable failure to act on his predictions. "There are people who must apologize to me, and they must have the weight of what occurred on their conscience," Giuliani said after the quake hit, according to local news site Ilcapoluogo.com. Last month, vans with loudspeakers drove around the area broadcasting Giuliani's warning after he claimed his method of predicting seismic events by radon gas emissions had forecast an imminent quake. The scientist was reported to police for spreading false alarms and was made to remove his findings from the Internet. "They called me an imbecile," he said.

According IlCapoluogo, Giuliani gave an interview as recently as March 24 in which he repeated his claims. Local authorities have insisted Monday's 6.3-magnitude event was part of a sequence of tremors in a quake-prone area and neither the size nor the timing was possible to predict. Giuliani said he was monitoring radon concentrations ahead of Monday's quake, but knew the authorities would press charges against him if he repeated his warning. "last night I did not know who to talk to. I could see the situation was deteriorating and there was nothing I could do," he said, according to IlCapoluogo.

Obama's record-breaking campaign haul From Paul Steinhauser, CNN President Obama speaks during a news conference at the White Houes July 11. STORY HIGHLIGHTSObama's haul beats the previous single-quarter record for an incumbentThe figure goes beyond what Obama and the DNC predictedAmong Republicans who have reported, Romney raised the most in the quarter
RELATED TOPICS
Barack Obama
Democratic National Committee
(CNN) -- President Barack Obama raised more than $86 million for his 2012 re-election campaign in the second quarter of this year, the campaign announced in a video e-mailed to supporters Wednesday. The figure represents money raised both by the Obama campaign itself and the Democratic National Committee, and comes from 552,462 individuals, campaign manager Jim Messina said. On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Messina said more than 260,000 of the donations came from individual new donors who did not contribute to the campaign in 2008. The contributions reflect "more grass roots support at this point in the process than any campaign in political history," Messina said, calling it a "monumental achievement." He said 98 percent of the donations were for $250 or less. The total goes far beyond the $50.1 million President George W. Bush pulled in for the third quarter of 2003, as his re-election campaign was gearing up. At the time, that was the most ever raised in a single quarter by an incumbent president seeking re-election. Messina said the new total show "our people are back and energized and there's a new generation of supporters that have joined our organization." They also have 60 field offices, in coordination with Organizing for America that are operational across the country, Messina said in the video. Organizing for America is President Obama's political organization that moved to the Democratic National Committee after his election in 2008. Last month, Obama and DNC sources predicted they would raise at least $60 million for the second quarter of 2011. But Messina and campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt downplayed the potential haul in the next quarter, when they said there is lag because of the summer months. Obama announced his re-election bid on April 4. Among Republicans seeking the presidential nomination who have released their second-quarter fundraising tallies so far, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is in the lead, with $18.3 million. "We intend to raise $50 million and more for the primary campaign, and we're off to a very good start," campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in a statement. Texas Rep. Ron Paul pulled in $4.5 million, while former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty collected $4.2 million. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman collected $4.1 million, which included $2 million of his own money. Huntsman announced his campaign in late June. Businessman Herman Cain collected $2.5 million, while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich collected $2 million and is approximately $1 million in debt. Former Pennsylvania Sen.Rick Santorum collected less than $2 million. Those figures do not include any funds raised by the Republican National Committee. Some Republican candidates have not yet reported their figures, including Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann.

Meteor shower will light up night sky for just a few hours
By CNN Staff
updated 5:19 AM EST, Thu January 3, 2013
CNN iReporter Abe Blair, a professional photographer, www.blindmanphotos.com shot pictures of the Perseid meteor shower over Crater Lake, Oregon for six to seven hours in August 2012.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: NASA says best time to watch is between 3 a.m. and dawn
The Quadrantid meteor shower will peak early Thursday morning The Quadrantids enter the atmosphere each January, burning up at 90,000 mph
This year, much of the world can see the show, if light from the moon doesn't interfere
(CNN) -- Skywatchers will be setting their alarm clocks for the early morning hours Thursday when the annual Quadrantid meteor shower peaks.
This year's show in the sky may not produce as many highlights for some viewers because of light from the moon, NASA said in a statement.
Meteor watchers can expect to see 60 to 200 meteors an hour streak across the sky, NASA said.
Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, said by e-mail that the shooting stars would be visible after about 11 p.m. in each time zone in the United States, with the best viewing time from 3 a.m. until dawn.
The Quadrantids were first noted in 1825 and got their name from the constellation of Quadrans Muralis, which is no longer considered a constellation by astronomers, according to NASA.
The material that is burning up in Earth's atmosphere during the Quadrantids likely comes from a comet that broke into fragments centuries ago, NASA says.
"After hundreds of years orbiting the sun, they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph, burning up 50 miles above Earth's surface," NASA said.
The space agency said observers at latitudes north of 51 degrees south should be able to see the meteor shower.
NASA and Ustream will have a webcast from Wednesday through Friday with one view of the meteor shower. The camera is mounted in Huntsville, Alabama, at the Marshall Space Flight Center.

Something in the water? Beckham off as four see red in Evian
updated 6:39 AM EDT, Mon April 29, 2013
Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was sent off after the final whistle.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Beckham sent off as Paris Saint-Germain beat Evian 1-0
The veteran midfielder had only been on the pitch six minutes before being dismissed
Three other players given their marching orders in an ill-tempered finale
PSG can wrap up the French Ligue 1 title this weekend
(CNN) -- David Beckham was sent off just six minutes after coming onto the pitch as three further dismissals and a mass brawl overshadowed Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 win over Evian.
The former England captain, who joined PSG in January on a five-month deal, was introduced as an 83rd-minute substitute for PSG before being given his marching orders for a lunging challenge on Youssef Adnane.
PSG, who are close to securing a first French Ligue 1 title in 19 years following the win, saw Italian midfielder Marco Verratti pick up a second yellow card two minutes before Beckham was brought on.
Tempers flared on and off the pitch, with PSG assistant coach Claude Makelele sent to the stands for remonstrating with officials.

CNN Football Club: German giants rise
PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu and Evian's Saber Khelifa were given red cards following a mass brawl which broke out on the final whistle.
The sending off could be Beckham's last act in a PSG shirt, with the 37-year-old's contract set to expire at the end of the current season.
"The referee lacked lucidity," PSG sporting director Leonardo told French newspaper Le Parisien. "He made mistakes. The red card shown to Beckham, for example, was really unfair.
"It was always a very tense match. Nobody wanted to lose -- especially not Evian, who are struggling to stay up," added Leonardo, referring to Evian's place in the Ligue 1 table, with the club level of points with third from bottom Sochaux.
"I also believe that our team is really tired at the end of the season."
Read: Van Persie scores on Arsenal return
The visitors' winning goal came in the 50th minute from Argentine Javier Pastore and allows PSG to wrap up the title on Sunday if they record a better result against Valenciennes than second-placed Marseille manage in Saturday's match with Bastia.
Sunday's red card wasn't the first Beckham has received in France.
The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star was infamously dismissed for kicking out at Argentina's Diego Simeone while playing for England at the 1998 World Cup.
Beckham was vilified by fans following the red card, with many blaming the midfielder for England's exit from the tournament.
Glenn Hoddle's team lost the second round match in Saint Etienne on penalties following a 2-2 draw.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Operation to clean up irradiated areas around Fukushima nuclear plant continues
Original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone around crippled facility remains
Residents only allowed access to outer parts of this area for limited periods
New radioactive leaks at plant continue to cause concern two and a half years on
Fukushima Prefecture, Japan (CNN) -- "You're listening to Fukushima FM." The cheery jingle on the radio reminds you of a different time in this part of eastern Japan, a different world that existed before March 11, 2011.
Driving past houses that residents can no longer call home, you can still see sandbags holding down tarpaulins on damaged roofs. They're the result of the devastating earthquake and tsunami more than two years ago, and repairs the owners have not yet been able to carry out.
We're inside the original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, an area completely evacuated after the tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems for three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing them to melt down and emit radioactive material.

Residents can now return to certain parts of the outer exclusion zone but only during the day. The government does not want to run the risk of accumulative radiation exposure if people stay for a full 24 hours.
Expert: Fukushima freeze plan not ideal
Was the response too slow?
Fukushima radiation worse than expected
By the side of the road we pass along, teams of workers are clearing the ground of radiation and have been since the summer of 2011. It's a colossal task that involves painstakingly removing the top layer of soil and grass to remove as much absorbed radiation as possible.
The government-funded operation will have cost $1.5 billion by the end of this fiscal year, according to the Japanese government. On any given day up to 8,000 people are working on the clean-up around Fukushima Prefecture.
More than a year ago, the workers here wore full protection suits, today they simply wear gloves and the basic face masks you can see anywhere in Japan -- a sign that the radiation level here has dropped.
Read: How did we get to this point?
Thousands of industrial-size black bags hold the contaminated soil. They are lined up in fields, waiting for their final resting place -- wherever that may be. This is a reminder that the problem of what to do with radioactive water at the crippled Fukushima plant is not the only storage issue this country has to deal with.
During the day, the steady volume of traffic in this outer part of the exclusion zone belies the invisible threat that still exists. It's a threat that two-and-a-half years later has residents wondering when, or even if, they will be able to move back home.

Castaway claims he drifted 13 months in Pacific
By Brian Walker and Brad Lendon, CNN
updated 7:07 PM EST, Mon February 3, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: His family in El Salvador thought he was dead
Castaway is identified as Jose Salvador Alvarenga, 37
Man says he lived off turtles and rainwater while adrift
Companion died four weeks after pair left Mexico, Alvarenga says
(CNN) -- A mysterious castaway claiming to have been lost at sea for 13 months is now safely back on land, but many questions remain about how he could have lived on his small boat for so long as it drifted across the Pacific Ocean.
The man calling himself Jose Salvador Alvarenga turned up in a heavily damaged boat on a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands, claiming that he had been living off fish and turtles he had caught and relying on rainwater, and sometimes his own urine, to drink.
Authorities are trying to determine the veracity of Alvarenga's story. The Mexican government issued a statement Monday confirming Alvarenga's identity and saying he was an El Salvador national who was living in Tonala in Chiapas state.
Alvarenga is from Garita Palmera in El Salvador, where CNN caught up with some members of his family. They hadn't heard from him in ages and thought he might be dead. He has a 12-year-old daughter there who doesn't remember her father.
"My heart would tell me that my son was not dead, but I wondered about it so often that I had started to lose faith," said Julia Alvarenga, his mother.
"God willing, my son is not dead. God willing, my son is alive. And we're going to see him again one day. I'm very happy after learning that he's alive and that we will have him back home soon," his father, Ricardo, said.
Alvarenga was found on sparsely populated Ebon Atoll, a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro, on Thursday. The southernmost of the Marshall Islands' atolls, Ebon has only 2.2 square miles of land, one phone line and no Internet service. The government airplane that services the atoll was not working, so Alvarenga did not make it to Majuro until Monday morning.
Video from Majuro shows Alvarenga walking a gangplank from a government boat to a waiting ambulance. Waving to those gathered around the dock, he is supported by a medical assistant as he walks. From inside the ambulance, he gives a thumbs up before it drives away.
Alvarenga, who says he is 37, is now in a local hospital recovering from his ordeal, said Tom Armbruster, U.S. ambassador to the Marshall Islands.
"He's in much better shape than one would expect after such an ordeal," Armbruster said.
In a hospital-bed interview with The Telegraph of London, Alvarenga told of how he hit land.
"I had just killed a bird to eat and saw some trees," he is quoted as saying.
"I cried, 'Oh, God.' I got to land and had a mountain of sleep. In the morning, I woke up and heard a rooster and saw chickens and saw a small house. I saw two native women screaming and yelling. I didn't have any clothes; I was only in my underwear, and they were ripped and torn," The Telegraph quotes Alvarenga as saying.
Teen survives 26 days adrift
People on the island where he was found Thursday say the 26-foot fiberglass boat was in very bad condition, covered in barnacles and with the carcasses of several turtles littering the deck.
Alvarenga is said to have set off from the Mexican town of Costa Azul, according to Reynaldo Aguilar Martinez, undersecretary for the state of Chiapas. He claims to have left for what was supposed to be a one-day expedition to catch sharks on December 21, 2012.
Alvarenga said that he and a teenage companion were blown off-course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm, eventually losing use of their engines.
How to survive being stranded at sea According to Anjenette Kattil of the Marshall Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, he lost the young man because he refused to eat raw birds. There are no details on what Alvarenga did with the young man's body.
Alvarenga told the Telegraph his companion's death had him contemplating suicide.
"For four days, I wanted to kill myself. But I couldn't feel the desire; I didn't want to feel the pain. I couldn't do it," he is quoted as saying.
Kattil said Alvarenga worked for a company named Camaroneras de la Costa in Mexico. He has told authorities that he is a citizen of El Salvador but has lived in Mexico for the past 15 years and wishes to be repatriated back to Mexico.
Armbruster, the U.S. ambassador, said Alvarenga indicated that he had relatives living the United States and U.S. officials would attempt to locate them.
Massive tuna drags fisherman into ocean
Government officials have been in contact with Mexico's ambassador to the Marshall Islands, who is based in the Philippines, concerning Alvarenga in hopes he can contact El Salvadoran authorities.
The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying it has sent personnel from its embassy in the Philippines "to learn directly about the case."
If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,700 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific.
Such an amazing journey isn't unheard-of in the small Pacific nation, as three Mexican fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months. Those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater, and they read the Bible for comfort.
Conditions in the Pacific make the timeline of Alvarenga's journey plausible, according to Judson Jones, a producer for CNN Weather.
Jones said the currents between Mexico and the Marshall Islands would have carried a boat about 27 miles (42 kilometers) a day. That would mean the journey would take about 208 days if the boat stayed in the current. But Jones said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely, making a 13-month journey believable.
