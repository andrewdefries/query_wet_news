CNN Access: 'Different ways to make a family' U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Texas sodomy law Bush uncertain about gay marriage ban  Massachusetts expected to rule on same-sex marriages  The Episcopal Church, USA  Vatican document WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Bush spokesman said Thursday a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is an option being considered at the White House, but the president and his lawyers are waiting for state court rulings to see "what may be needed."
A day after Bush revealed his staff was looking at ways to "codify" his belief that marriage should be limited to unions between a man and a woman, his spokesman noted a constitutional amendment is being "publicly debated" and acknowledged it is something the White House is considering "in this context."
"There are some court cases that are happening, that are still pending," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan. "There is speculation there may be some decisions soon in places like Massachusetts and New Jersey, so it's a question of what may be needed legally to protect and defend the sanctity of marriage."
McClellan said the president "strongly supports" the Defense of Marriage Act, and suggested there is concern state rulings concerning gay marriage may necessitate updating or amending that law.
The Defense of Marriage Act, signed into law in 1996 by President Clinton, prevents federal recognition of same-sex marriage, and allows states to ignore same-sex licenses from outside their borders.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota, said he believes that law is enough.
"The word marriage means only a legal union between one man and one woman, as a husband and wife, and the word spouse refers only to the person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife," said Daschle, reading from the law.
"You can't get any clearer than that. ... No changes are necessary in my view. You've got it in law today," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee, has endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. The amendment is being pushed by conservative groups and is pending in the House of Representatives.
When he was asked whether the president, in opposing gay marriage, risks alienating the moderate voters he has tried to court, McClellan said the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman is a "principle he will not compromise on."
"He is strongly committed to protecting the sanctity of marriage," McClellan said, "this is an issue that has been raised because of some court cases and we're going to continue to monitor those court cases and the president is strongly committed as a matter of principle to protecting the sanctity of marriage."
Prefacing his views on same-sex marriage Wednesday in the White House Rose Garden, the president cited a biblical warning against being critical of others, said it is "very important for our society to respect each individual," and noted, "I am mindful that we're all sinners."
When asked if Bush considers homosexuality a sin, McClellan responded someone's sexual orientation is "personal business in the president's view."
He added, "The president is not someone who believes in casting stones. He is someone who believes that everybody ought to be treated with continuing respect."

Why GOP wants to run against PelosiBy Ed Rollins, CNN Senior Political Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTSEd Rollins says Democrats trying to run vs. Bush, Republicans vs. PelosiHe says the House speaker has presided over huge increase in budget deficitRollins: Governments need to live within means, let taxpayers hold on to more moneyTale of a strapped California city shows consequences of free-spending approach, he saysEditor's note: Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor for CNN, is senior presidential fellow at the Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University. He is a principal with the Dilenschneider Group, a global public relations firm. He was White House political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. New York (CNN) -- It's become apparent that the president and his party want to run in November against George W. Bush and Denny Hastert and the alleged mess they left him. The problem with that strategy is the former president and former House speaker are long gone from the D.C. scene. The Republicans want to run against Nancy Pelosi and the liberal Democrats running Congress and the mess they are making now. And who can blame them? The speaker is front and center and she presents a great target. Especially when she makes idiotic comments like she did this week. Speaking in support of the unfunded unemployment benefit extension package passed by the Senate by one vote on Wednesday, she said, "It injects demand into the economy," arguing that when families have money to spend it keeps the economy churning. "It creates jobs faster than almost any other initiative you can name." If she thinks unemployment benefits are what's going to make this economy rebound, her days are numbered as speaker. Why does giving someone unemployment benefits stimulate the economy (and I am not opposed to doing it; if offset elsewhere)? Video: Bachmann unveils Tea Party Caucus

The benefits have to be paid for, and it hardly helps the economy to take hard-earning wages from working people in the form of increased taxes. I have never understood why Democrats in Congress think they can spend your money more effectively from Washington than you can from where you live and work. The speaker also misstates the facts. In her own blog she writes: "The Democratic-led Congress is changing the way Washington works to save taxpayers billions and restore responsibility. We have passed a fiscally responsible budget that slashes in half the $1.3 trillion Bush deficit, with key initiatives cutting waste and fraud and collecting unpaid taxes." I don't know if the speaker herself wrote this blog, but it needs a major rewrite, because these are the facts: Her Congress hasn't even passed a budget resolution for the coming year, which it should have done months ago. All I see her doing is twisting arms to get her members to pass enormous spending bills. When Pelosi became speaker in January 2007, the annual budget deficit was $160 billion. When she finishes her term in January, this year's deficit will be more than $1.5 trillion. The trillion-dollar health care bill was drafted in her House. The $800 billion stimulus bill was drafted in her House by her committee chairmen. And who knows what we got this week with the passage of a 2,300-page-plus bill. The Frank-Dodd regulatory reform bill signed Wednesday adds hundreds of regulations, creates government agencies and will put the federal government in every financial transaction that you the consumer will be involved in. It doesn't offer any assurances that it will benefit the economy one iota, either. One thing you can bet on: It will cost you more to do ordinary business and won't encourage banks to loan money quicker. No matter who the Congress tries to blame, they, not the president have total control of the budget process. It's the congressional budget that spends money and raises taxes to pay for it. Having been around politics and government for four decades, the one thing I do know is there are no easy answers. If the problems were easily solved they would have been solved decades ago. But what I do know is that spending more of my 15-year-old daughter's future is not the responsible thing to do. The federal government isn't alone in running up red ink. Forty-six states are facing budget gaps that total $112 billion, according to a Bloomberg story quoting the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research institution. Many cities, both large and small, are also in financial despair. The northern California city where I grew up, Vallejo, was the first capital of the state in 1851. It unfortunately had to file for bankruptcy in May 2008. The city had agreed to union demands after a police strike to make Vallejo's police and firefighters among the highest paid in the state. Foolishly, the city council had surrendered in labor negotiations and given compensation packages for police captains that topped $300,000 a year and averaged $171,000 a year for firefighters. According to the Wall Street Journal, regular public employees in the city could retire at age 55 with 81 percent of their final year's pay in pensions. Police and fire officials could retire at age 50 with a pension that pays them 90 percent of their final year's salary as long as they live -- and for the rest of their spouses' lives. The end result was that the salaries and benefits for public safety workers accounted for nearly three-fourths of Vallejo's general fund budget. The city, unable to alter the contracts, was forced to slash everything else and eventually to go bankrupt. This followed the takeover by the state of California of the Vallejo unified school district in 2004 for insolvency. The local school board is now making the tough decisions, closing schools and laying off teachers. This saddens me because this was a great city with wonderful hard-working people. Ironically, the neighboring member of Congress, in nearby San Francisco, is Nancy Pelosi. Vallejo's bankruptcy documents quote an article that has become its governing mantra as it struggles to recover. It's a set of tips from Governing Magazine: "Live within your means. Look to your future. Stop deferring expenses. Fund your retirement obligations. Dedicate your surplus. Set up a rainy day fund." That's pretty good counsel for all our elected officials. Pretty good counsel for all of us. But whichever side wins in November, the task ahead is difficult. The choices are tough choices. To the American taxpayers, for the first time since Ross Perot in 1992, deficits do matter! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.

House Democrats agonize over leadership choices By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Pelosi seeks support to remain House Democratic leaderRep. Steny Hoyer and Rep. James Clyburn both want to become House minority whipHouse Republicans announce the members of their transition teamRep. Pete Sessions will seek another term as head of the NRCC Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats engaged in a furious internal debate Monday about the future direction of their party -- a direction made more uncertain in the wake of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's unexpected decision to seek another term despite the party's massive losses in last week's midterm elections. Democrats are still grappling with the consequences of a net loss of at least 60 seats to the House Republicans, who are now set to reclaim majority status a mere four years after giving it up. Pelosi's defenders argue she's been an effective legislative leader who is well positioned to help Democrats reclaim their majority in 2012. Her detractors contend she has become a partisan lightning rod that will hamper the party's efforts to win back more moderate districts. Pelosi herself remained sequestered behind closed doors on Capitol Hill Monday, talking to members from her office over the phone in an attempt to round up support, according to a source close to the speaker. In an effort to demonstrate support for her retaining the top Democratic spot, Pelosi's office released a summary of favorable press coverage including quotes from analysts and pundits. Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, indicated his support for her, issuing a statement calling the veteran San Francisco Democrat "a tireless champion for working families." There has been some grumbling among the diminished band of so-called moderate "Blue Dog" Democrats that Pelosi needs to go. But no Democrat has stepped forward to challenge Pelosi so far, and it appears unlikely that moderates can marshal enough votes to defeat her. Before the midterm, Rep. Heath Shuler, D-North Carolina, pledged he would run against Pelosi if a "viable candidate" did not emerge. Shuler, however, has since refused to indicate what his plans are. Angst among Democratic moderates over Pelosi's desire to retain her leadership comes on top of a heated contest over who will become the next minority whip. Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer and South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn are both seeking the post, which will be the second highest position for House Democrats in the next Congress. The more moderate Hoyer has served as Pelosi's top lieutenant in the current Democratic-controlled Congress, while the more liberal Clyburn has been the number-three Democrat. Their loss of the majority, however, has eliminated one of the Democrats' leadership slots. Complicating matters for Hoyer: a disproportionate share of the Democrats who went down to defeat last week were Blue Dogs more likely to back him. The remaining caucus members are believed to be more uniformly liberal and perhaps therefore predisposed to support Clyburn. In an effort to push back at the notion that Hoyer lacks support from the so-called "progressive" wing of the caucus, over the weekend sources close to Hoyer emphasized support from members such as New York Rep. Jerry Nadler and California Rep. Bob Filner. Hoyer has more public endorsements than Clyburn to date, and a letter released Sunday night included the names of 30 House Democrats reflecting a cross section of the Democratic caucus. But Clyburn's camp has cautioned that the he continues to build support, and says many members prefer not to make their endorsements public. Hoyer and Clyburn, like Pelosi, have been working the phones, talking to lawmakers to try to gather support in their competition for the number-two spot. Sources close to each have insisted to CNN that their candidate will prevail. Hoyer's camp says he is having success convincing Democratic lawmakers that he is more of a uniting force, something that is critical in the new Democratic leadership. A source close to Clyburn --- one of the top African-Americans in the House -- voiced similar confidence about his effort to be House minority whip, promising that "he will lock up the votes." California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, head of the Congressional Black Caucus, sent a letter to other House Democrats Monday urging them to back Clyburn. Lee called him an "extremely effective consensus builder" who has "learned how to work with conservatives and moderates to get results." Clyburn characterized himself the underdog in his contest with Hoyer during an appearance Monday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." But he also promised that, regardless of the outcome, the two would be able to work effectively together in the future. "I've been here 18 years. Steny's been here 30 years. He has his friends. I have mine. And Steny and I are friends," Clyburn said. "We are not going to leave this (leadership race) angry at each other." One Clyburn confidant nevertheless bemoaned the choice now facing House Democrats. "Folks don't want this election to happen," the source said. "They think it could tear the caucus apart. ... It is like choosing your favorite child." Some Democratic sources say they believe that in the end, both Hoyer and Clyburn will be part of the leadership, with one taking the number-three slot of Democratic caucus chairman. "They're both going to be at the table, I'm absolutely convinced," Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." Other sources close to both Hoyer and Clyburn have also indicated there have been discussions about working out a deal to avoid a divisive vote, which is slated to take place in two weeks when Congress returns for a lame-duck session. Who would get the higher-ranking slot would likely depend on privately proving he has the most votes. But one senior Democratic source warned that a deal maintaining leadership status for Clyburn and Hoyer could be a problem for rank-and-file party members looking for some sort of change in the leadership team. "The perception that these things are being manipulated, happening behind closed doors, is something that needs to be taken seriously," the source said. For their part, House Republicans avoided a potentially contentious leadership fight Monday when Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, announced his decision not to challenge Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, for the position of majority whip -- the third highest ranking position in the House GOP hierarchy. Sessions will instead seek another term as head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is tasked with heading House GOP campaign efforts. "I have fulfilled my initial mission statement: to retire Speaker Nancy Pelosi," Sessions said in a written statement. But "despite record victories as NRCC Chairman, my vision and work is not done. I strongly believe in selling the fight, and I will be asking my colleagues to support me as NRCC Chairman next Congress to strengthen our gains and advance an agenda for American prosperity." GOP leader John Boehner, likely the next House speaker, immediately praised Sessions' decision. "I am very grateful for Pete's tireless work as he has helped to guide House Republicans from the political wilderness to an historic victory for the American people," Boehner said. McCarthy also played a key role in 2010 House GOP campaign efforts, playing a lead role in crafting the "Pledge to America," a 45-page document outlining Republican plans for the next Congress. House Transition Chairman Greg Walden, R-Oregon, also announced 21 other members of the incoming Congress who will help oversee the GOP's switch from minority to majority status. Newly elected representatives from Alabama, Colorado, Illinois and South Carolina are among those joining the GOP's transition team.CNN's Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and Evan Glass contributed to this report

Melodifestivalen: Sweden's not-so-guilty Eurovision pleasure
By Stina Backer, for CNN
updated 3:57 AM EDT, Fri May 25, 2012
The Swedish pop group ABBA performs the hit "Waterloo" at Eurovision 1974, held in Brighton in the UK. The group's victory inspired a long-lasting Swedish love affair with the competition -- and the annual "Melodifestivalen" national song contest through which the Swedish Eurovision entry is chosen.
Ola Salo, lead singer of Swedish glam rock act The Ark performs the song "The Worrying Kind" at Eurovision 2007 in Helsinki, Finland. Despite having had four albums top the charts in their homeland, and being a favorite with the bookies, the band finished in 18th place.
One of Sweden's most popular female singers, Charlotte Nilsson won Eurovision 1999 in Jersualem with the song "Take Me To Heaven." She is pictured here performing as Charlotte Perrelli in Eurovision 2008, held in Belgrade, Serbia. Despite being tipped to repeat her earlier success, she finished 18th.
Eric Saade, who was spotted by talent scouts at the tender age of 13, came third in Eurovision 2011, held in Dusseldorf, Germany, with his song "Popular." It was one of 18 occasions that acts from Sweden -- one of the best-performing nations at Eurovision -- have placed in the top 5. Dedicated Swedish fans attend the finals of Eurovision 2006 in Athens, Greece, the year that Swedish singer Carola Haggkvist finished fifth. Sweden has won Eurovision four times, a record beaten only by Ireland (seven), France and the UK (five apiece). The Netherlands has also had four wins.
Sweden's entry this year, Loreen, was the bookies' favorite with "Euphoria" and she duly delivered.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sweden has a tradition of Eurovision success, having won the contest four times It selects its entry each year through a televised national song contest called "Melodifestivalen"
The show is the highest rated program in Swedish history, more popular than Eurovision Sweden's 2012 entry, "Euphoria" by Loreen, was the bookies' favorite to win
(CNN) -- To the rest of the world, Sweden seems to represent all that is enviably European. Scandinavia's largest country has a reputation for being stylish, progressive and glacially cool -- in short, everything the Eurovision Song Contest is not.
So it may come as a surprise to some to learn that the Swedes take the annual song competition -- occasionally viewed by some of their neighbors as a bit of a joke -- very seriously indeed.
Unlike in many other western European countries, the privilege of representing Sweden at the annual contest is hotly contested, through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than Eurovision itself.
Melodifestivalen, a six-week, "American Idol"-style TV series in which established acts compete against unknowns for the honor of representing Sweden, has broken every local ratings record. Nearly half of the country's 9.4 million people tuned in to this year's final.
"Melodifestivalens is the Swedish equivalent to the Superbowl," said Per Blankens who produced the TV show in 2006 and 2007.
Swedes are obsessed with music ... It's only natural for us to get worked up about a music competitionPer Blankens, former "Melodifestivalen" producer
"No other TV show gets the Swedes so rallied up. People put on dinner parties just so they can watch it together. They even get dressed up for the occasion."
Forgettable song, memorable outfit: The crazy clothes of Eurovision The show has proven an invigorating force for the Swedish music industry, reviving old pop careers, launching new ones and selling thousands of records and concert tickets in the process.
But why do the Swedes, often viewed as cool, collected tastemakers, get so worked up about a contest widely seen as having little musical credibility?
Proud tradition
"A lot of people don't know this, but Swedes are obsessed with music," said Blankens, who followed his stint on Melodifestivalen (Melody Festival) by producing the Swedish version of American Idol.
"Not only are all the most popular TV shows in Sweden music-related, but choral singing is the second most popular pastime after sports. It's only natural for us to get worked up about a music competition."
That love of music has translated to a long history of Eurovision success, with the most wins in the competition after Ireland (seven), France, Luxembourg and the UK (five each). The Netherlands has also won four times.
The love affair began when ABBA won the 1974 contest with their hit "Waterloo," launching them on their way to becoming Eurovision's greatest success story and one of the biggest-selling pop bands of all time.
It's a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well ... they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across ScandinaviaChrister Bjorkman, former Eurovision contestant known as "Mr Melodifestivalen"
The Swedish entry this year, "Euphoria" by Loreen, was the bookies' favorite to follow in their footsteps and duly delivered success at the 57th Eurovision, in Baku, Azerbaijan.
The tradition of success has seen many Swedes grow up with "Melodifestivalen" and Eurovision as annual fixtures in their households.
"Watching Eurovision is a national tradition in Sweden," said Maria Akesson, 28, a motion graphics student from Stockholm. "When I was a kid it was the only night, apart from New Year's Eve, that my parents would allow me to stay up past midnight and let me eat as much crisps and candy as I liked."
Even as an adult, Eurovision remains a big occasion. "I watch it with my friends and there's always someone who will organize a house party where we'll cook strange dishes from all the different countries and bet money on what song will win. People usually take the betting really seriously but we add silly categories like the worst outfit or the worst song."
"Melodifestivalen"'s timing -- screening on Saturday nights for six weeks in the middle of the country's famously gloomy winters -- is seen as another reason for its enduring appeal.
"Sweden in the winter is very dark and can be quite depressing. When 'Melodifestivalen' starts airing in February we're in the middle of this season, but every week leading up to the final is a week closer to spring," said Sebastian Hjalmarsson Downey-Clark, a self-confessed Eurovision addict who works in London as a primary school teacher.
"It's almost as if 'Melodifestivalen' is the vessel that carries Sweden from the dark of winter to the light of summer, and soundtracks that journey with some awfully catchy music too."
Reviving the contest
Sweden's musical superpowers * Sweden is the world's third largest music exporter after the U.S. and the UK
* Eight of this year's Eurovision songs have been written by Swedes including the UK, Ireland and Spain
* The 2012 Irish entry "Waterline," sung by Jedward, is written by Swedes but was rejected in Swedish auditions in 2010 and 2011
* The 2011 Eurovision winner "Running Scared," sung by Ell and Nikki from Azerbaijan, was written by Swedes
"Melodifestivalen" is nearly as old as Eurovision itself, having run almost every year since 1959. But it wasn't always such a polished affair.
"In the 1990s the competition was struggling. There weren't enough good artists wanting to take part so it was decided that something radical needed to happen," said Christer Bjorkman, a former hairdresser who won "Melodifestivalen" in 1992.
So in 2002, he oversaw the transformation of the contest from one-off contest between ten songs into a six-week pop marathon featuring 32. The ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of Swedish industry experts, and Eurovision judges from 11 other countries.
The new format, featuring knock-out semi-finals held in cities across Sweden, was a smash hit, and Bjorkman has been involved in the production of every contest since. Today he is known as "Mr Melodifestivalen."
"Taking the show on the road was incredibly important to its success as it galvanized local support," he said. "Equally as important was the fact that the audience now have weeks to familiarize themselves with all the songs. They form emotional attachments to the songs and, ultimately, also the winner -- which is one of the reasons why so many Swedes still care about how we do in Eurovision."
The resulting surge of interest in "Melodifestivalen" sees thousands of songs submitted to the contest each year, and has been a boon to the Swedish music industry. "It's a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well in the competition, as they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across Scandinavia," said Blankens.
Bjorkman agrees. "The competition is enormously important for the Swedish music industry because not only does it launch new careers and revives old ones, it sells a lot of albums too," he said. "From winter until spring, our songs occupy the charts. The final was in March, but four of our songs are still in the top ten."
'Why not try?'
The Swedes are very aware that not every country shares their infatuation with Eurovision.
"Big countries who take themselves quite seriously -- like Britain and France -- don't really want to compete against all these tiny nations on the European periphery in some silly music competition," said Blankens. "They think it's beneath them, so they keep sending bad songs that never win."
But given the benefits to Sweden's music industry from the country's Eurovision obsession, perhaps the question shouldn't be why does Sweden care, but why don't others?
"Ultimately you get what you give," said Bjorkman. "In countries like the UK they don't give much -- in fact they keep changing the format of the national try-outs each year. It's no wonder the public has lost interest in ... Eurovision."
"Melodifestivalen"'s success owes much to the Swedish tendency not to "do things by half measures," he said. "When we decided to revive 'Melodifestivalen,' our aim was to create an amazing and engaging TV program that would benefit not only us as broadcasters, but the music industry and the viewers as well. I'm very proud to say that we have succeeded in doing just that."

Rights to Judy Garland's TV series to be auctioned
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 1:13 PM EST, Fri December 21, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"This would be a great Christmas gift for somebody," seller Darryl Payne says
Bidding for U.S. rights to "The Judy Garland Show" starts at $1 million
Barbra Streisand sang a memorable duet with Garland in one episode
The buyer will be able to stream, rebroadcast or sell DVDs of the 26 star-filled episodes
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Looking for that special Christmas gift for the Judy Garland fan who has everything? Consider giving them the U.S. rights to the legendary actress-singer's television variety series.
"This would be a great Christmas gift for somebody," said Darryl Payne, a music producer who bought the rights in 1998 from Sam Luft, Garland's former husband.
"The Judy Garland Show," which cost CBS $24 million in 1963, is being auctioned this weekend with a starting bid of $1 million. The bidding, conducted online by The Royalty Exchange, is set to end Sunday afternoon.
"You get Judy Garland," Payne said. "She's singing, she's dancing. You get all the biggest stars of that era."
Then-rising star Barbra Streisand sang a memorable duet with Garland in one episode, before the singer filmed "Funny Girl," her breakout movie. The appearance earned Streisand her first Emmy nomination.
Garland's daughter Liza Minelli, then 17, was a guest, along with many other entertainment legends: Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, Count Basie, Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, Bob Newhart, Donald O'Connor, Steve Allen, Jane Powell, Peter Lawford, Vic Damone and Jack Jones.
While clips of the series have been licensed over the years, the episodes have not been shown on television since the series was canceled in March 1964, Payne said.
The buyer can sell DVDs or rebroadcast in the United States the 26 star-filled episodes hosted by Garland for a season on CBS starting in 1963. The new owner could also license the series for streaming online or downloading, Payne said.
The remastered digitized video also includes never-before-seen outtakes from the show, Payne said.
Garland died of a drug overdose at age 47, five years after the series was taken off the air.

Europe's best budget ski resorts
By Joe Minihane, Special to CNN
updated 1:13 AM EST, Mon January 21, 2013
Soldeu is Andorra's biggest and best resort, with an incredibly cheap weekly pass (US$259).
With several different resorts, Zakopane is pushing Poland's growing reputation as a go-to spot for winter sports. One resort, Nosal, has four beginner runs as well as a steeper area for the advanced border and skier, making it the perfect pick for those wanting to stay in one place.
Cerna Hora has 14 slopes and is accessed by the country's only eight-person gondala.
The resort is not far from the spa town of Janské Lázně, home to thermal pools and a picturesque town center.
Good snow, a heaving bar scene -- it's no wonder Bulgaria is becoming a top ski destination for those seeking a cheaper alternative to the likes of Switzerland and Italy.
Heavy snowfall and cold temperatures mean CairnGorm mountain is buried in snow from December to March. The resort is geared toward beginners and intermediates.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
These budget slopes make every fall a little softer on the wallet
East means cheap, especially if you're after a European ski holiday
Bulgaria is gaining a reputation as a top destination for skiers
(CNN) -- For the budget conscious, the mere mention of skiing in Europe has been known to cause whiplash from people reaching around too quickly for their wallets.
Those who keep a close watch on their cash tend to avoid resorts that charge the equivalent of a mortgage payment for the privilege of taking a few runs down a mountain and then forking out US$20 for a hot cider afterward.
Europe's famed alpine destinations are the worst culprits. Look beyond the pistes of Switzerland, Austria and France, however, and there are bargains to be found across the continent.
7 underrated ski resorts
Soldeu, Andorra High in the Pyrenees and sandwiched between France and Spain, Andorra is an ideal alternative to the more pricey Alps.
Soldeu is the tiny nation's biggest and best resort, with an incredibly cheap weekly pass (US$259), and one-day access costing just US$57.
Best of all, the pass covers the wider Grandvalira area, with access to other resorts and an impressive 204 kilometers (126 miles) of runs.
The focus is largely on family at this beginner-to-intermediate hill, though there are plenty of lively bars in Soldeu village.
The resort is accessible from budget airports at Perpignan in the south of France, and Girona, north of Barcelona.
Lift pass: US$259 for five days out of seven; www.soldeu-andorra.com 7 stunning European ski lodges
Nosal, Zakopane, Poland In Europe, east means cheap, especially if you're after a European ski holiday.
Zakopane best exemplifies Poland's underground reputation as a go-to spot for winter sports. This vast area has a number of different resorts, each offering lift passes for which you need to buy separate tickets.
But considering you can take 15 trips on the Nosal resort's lift for just $16, with nearby Gubalowka offering 10 rides from the same amount, it's cheap to hop around and try different slopes.
Packages are recommended for this type of trip, as transportation between areas can be tricky without an organized tour.
If you want to stick with one place, Nosal is the pick. It has four good beginner runs and a vicious, steep black area for veteran skiers and snowboarders.
Best of all, the runs are open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., with floodlights fired up after sunset.
Lift pass: US$16; www.zakopane-life.com
Cerna Hora, Czech Republic
Cerna Hora is home to the country's longest single run, a two-kilometer monster (1.2 mile) that'll test the hardiest alpine skier.
As with most eastern European resorts, the lift pass is an insanely good value. The US$89 three-day pass makes Cerna Hora ideal for weekend trips. Its 14 slopes are reached by the Czech Republic's only eight-person gondola. The area also has 70 kilometers (43 miles) of cross-country routes.
What sets Cerna Hora apart is proximity to the spa town of Janské Lázně. With thermal pools and a picturesque town center, it's the ideal place to unwind after a day strapped into your ski boots.
Seven-day lift pass: US$162; three-day lift pass for US$89; www.cerna-hora.cz
10 top ski resorts in Asia
Bansko, Bulgaria
Bulgaria is gaining a reputation as the top destination for skiers desperate for good snow and heaving local bars, but who lack funds to hit the likes of Switzerland and Italy.
About 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of the capital of Sofia, and located at the foot of the Pirin Mountains, Bansko is the country's biggest and best resort.
It's something of a mission to reach, but worth the effort. The area has been modernized in recent years, with decent hotels and stacks of traditional "mehana" for excellent local food, including rich salads, soups, meats and, of course, wine and Bulgarian rakia.
The season runs until mid-April, depending on snowfall.
Five-day lift pass: US$186; www.banskoski.com 4 ultra-cool winter activities in the U.S. CairnGorm, Scotland
You may not know it, but the wilds of Scotland have become popular as a skiing destination in recent years. Bitterly cold winters and heavy snowfall mean CairnGorm mountain is buried in snow from December to March.
Skiers and boarders hit the slopes between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., light depending, with 30 kilometers (18 miles) of runs, dedicated snowboard park and lots of cross-country trails.
Not necessarily great for a weeklong trip, CairnGorm is worth a visit if you're on a city break in Edinburgh and don't mind the two-and-a-half-hour drive north.
Geared toward beginners and intermediates, CairnGorm is good if you want to try skiing for the first time or don't fancy the rigmarole of arranging an entire trip based around the slopes and aprés ski excess.
Lift pass: US$52; www.cairngormmountain.org Have you got a favorite budget ski resort? Tell us about it in the comments section. 0

Obama: No one listening to your calls
By Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 8:26 PM EDT, Sun June 9, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
U.S. programs represent troubling, "massive surveillance," author says
"Nobody is listening to your telephone calls," the president says
The formerly secret surveillance programs help prevent terror, he says
But critics say U.S. programs go too far and should be rolled back
(CNN) -- Details on millions of American phone calls. Records of e-mails, texts, video chats and more from overseas. And pulsing beneath it all, a worrying concern there's more to the government's surveillance programs than what's been acknowledged.
All the revelations about U.S. surveillance programs in recent days have put the government on the defensive, set privacy advocates howling for reform and left millions of Americans somewhere in the middle, wondering what the news means to them and what, if anything, they should do about it.
The man at the top says they should just relax.
"Nobody is listening to your telephone calls," President Barack Obama said Friday as he tried to reassure Americans who have had to digest a dizzying array of revelations in the past few days. Among them:
U.S. intelligence agencies mining data
Fleischer: I praise President Obama
Paul: Govt. data mining not a surprise Dershowitz: Don't overreact to NSA acts
-- U.S. intelligence agencies are, in fact, collecting details on just about every telephone call placed each day in the United States, U.S. officials confirmed. And they've been doing it for seven years, a senator added.
-- They're also monitoring the online activities of at least some overseas customers of Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple and other providers of popular online services.
NSA Web snooping no big deal to some -- And they may be scooping up credit card data, as well, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing people familiar with the operations of the National Security Agency.
U.S. officials say the phone-call data isn't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terror, and only then on the authority of a judge. And officials say analysts are forbidden from slurping up the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas.
The Wall Street Journal said it wasn't clear whether the credit card monitoring was a continuing program or a one-off, and didn't say what analysts did with the information.
Analysts say such information can be analyzed using powerful computers and sophisticated software to detect personal habits and links among groups of people, and to build detailed dossiers on the activities of everyday people.
The government says it is not doing that, but privacy activists say even the limited amount of data collection U.S. officials have acknowledged poses huge threats.
"The problem is its massive surveillance," said author James Bamford, who has written extensively about NSA surveillance programs. "We went through this problem with the Bush administration, warrantless eavesdropping. It was an outrage that government can turn the surveillance on average citizens without any suspicion whatsoever."
Uphill climb to appeal federal data mining
"And here, this is an enormous increase in that," he said on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" on Thursday. "This is communications that are local. These aren't even international communications at all. These are communications from people speaking to their neighbors, people that are under no suspicion whatsoever."
The American Civil Liberties Union described the programs as "beyond Orwellian."
And the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been fighting the government over surveillance programs for years, is urging a full-scale investigation with an eye toward stopping the surveillance programs for good and reining in U.S. intelligence agencies with new laws and a demand for public oversight.
"The revelations not only confirmed what EFF has long alleged, they went even further and honestly, we're still reeling," the privacy organization said Friday on its blog.
Telephone monitoring
The revelations began Wednesday, when a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a top secret order from an intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other analysts said similar orders undoubtedly are in effect for other companies.
The order doesn't allow authorities to listen in on the calls.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who denied during a March 12 congressional hearing that the government was engaged in mass data-collection practices involving Americans, blasted the Guardian report, saying it "omits key information" regarding "safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties."
Opinion: Where's evidence data mining saves lives?
He said the program operates within the law, respects Americans' privacy and is crucial to preventing attacks. Most of the records are never looked at, and those that are can be reviewed only with judicial approval, he said.
"The collection is broad in scope because more narrow collection would limit our ability to screen for and identify terrorism-related communications. Acquiring this information allows us to make connections related to terrorist activities over time," he said.
Clapper said both Congress and courts have reviewed and authorized the law.
But several congressional critics have complained that the government has made significant use of broad interpretations made in secret by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the judicial body charged with overseeing the government's use of the law.
"These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure," Patriot Act co-author Rep. James Sensenbrenner wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.
Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, said he was "extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act."
How does U.S. data collection affect me?
Online monitoring
A day after the initial Guardian report on the Verizon court order, the Guardian and the Washington Post published reports alleging the NSA is able to tap into data held by some of the world's biggest online services companies as it hunts for terrorists.
The program, which the newspapers said is called PRISM, reportedly allows NSA analysts access to computers at Microsoft, Google and other companies to extract details of customer activities, including "audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents" and other materials, The Post reported.
The Post reported PRISM, founded in 2007, has become the leading source of raw material for the NSA.
Clapper did not directly confirm the program's existence but acknowledged that the Post and Guardian stories "refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act."
That section of the law authorizes intelligence agencies to collect information on non-U.S. residents as part of efforts to gather foreign intelligence.
He said the program cannot be used to target anyone inside the United States or U.S. citizens anywhere in the world and includes "extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons."
"Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats," Clapper said Thursday.
"The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans," he said.
While the Post initially reported that the companies "knowingly participate" in the program, it later updated the online version of its story to remove that contention.
In its stead, the newspaper described a classified report indicating that NSA analysts were allowed to send "content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations."
AT&T, Verizon and Comcast declined to comment on the report Friday. Time Warner said it was unfamiliar with PRISM.
Microsoft said Thursday that it doesn't participate in any national security data gathering program. Facebook and Google said they do not give government agencies direct access to their servers.
And Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said his company has never heard of the program.
NSA's phone snooping a different kind of creepy
Necessary measures
While controversial to some, the programs also have plenty of backers. Obama noted that Congress has repeatedly endorsed the programs on a bipartisan basis.
Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California liberal, both believe the methods are necessary to prevent terrorism.
"Terrorists will come after us if they can," Feinstein said, "and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us."
Graham said that as a Verizon customer, "it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Agency to have my phone number."
Previous efforts
Similar efforts have floated to the surface for years.
After the 2001 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush's administration authorized the NSA to conduct wireless surveillance of international phone calls that included at least one person believed to be an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist.
The program was later ruled unconstitutional.
Another Bush-era program, the "total information awareness" program, would have combined vast government databases into a data-mining effort to look for suspicious patterns revealing potential criminal or terrorist activity. It was official dropped amid intense outcry from civil libertarians.
Also, in 2003, a former AT&T technician made a splash when he alleged that the telecom was routing all Internet traffic into a special NSA-controlled room in San Francisco.
Last year, Bamford wrote in Wired magazine about a huge data center being built for the NSA in Utah. Officials have officially labeled the center as part of the nation's effort to fight cyberattacks, but the Wired article, citing former NSA officials and others, said it was part of a huge surveillance program that would take in and analyze untold amounts of data.
Obama takes heat
The reports have increased scrutiny of Obama's record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's efforts to combat terrorism.
Days after taking office in 2009, Obama vowed, "Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency." But on Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post on its home page conflated an image of Obama with one of his predecessor, Bush, in a move to criticize the secret surveillance both administrations have been accused of.
A New York Times editorial said "the administration has now lost all credibility" when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism.
Obama said Friday that he entered office skeptical of the programs. But after thoroughly vetting them and adding additional safeguards -- which he did not identify -- Obama said he concluded they were worthwhile.
"My assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks," he said. "And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and without looking at content, that on net it was worth us doing."
Obama said he welcomed debate on the issue, but said some compromises are going to be necessary, no matter what.
"I think it is important to recognize that you can't have 100% security and then also have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience," he said. "You know, we are going to have to make some choices as a society."

11 places to go in 2014
By Tamara Hinson, for CNN
updated 12:54 AM EST, Sat December 14, 2013
The Panama Canal's 100-year anniversary arguably is not, in and of itself, a top five reason for visiting the country in 2014. But the events surrounding the big day and Panama's other attractions certainly are.
If you're a football fan, or a beach fan, or a party fan, or a wildlife fan, and especially if you're all of the above, Brazil will be hard to beat as a destination in 2014. Hosting the World Cup during June and July, it also offers great areas like the Amazon basin and the amazing Iguazu Falls.
Myanmar has been touted as "the next big tourism destination" for a few years already, but getting around the country has proved tricky. That's started to change already and next year it's going to accelerate under a new tourism "master plan." "With NASA scientists predicting that an 11-year cycle of solar activity will peak this winter, for the first few months of 2014 the Northern Lights are expected to put on their most spectacular display for the next decade," says David Phillips, operations manager for Explorers Astronomy Tours.
In the last few months Ecuador's new Minister of Tourism, Vinicio Alvarado, announced a $600 million investment in tourism over the next four years as part of a plan to become a "tourism powerhouse." It's probably the best vacation spot you haven't yet considered, unless your name's Julian Assange. If doing more exercise is one of your 2014 resolutions (and this time you mean it), an extended trip to New Zealand could provide the means. The 2,500-kilometer Nga Haerenga cycle trail in New Zealand will be completed in 2014, showcasing the best of the country's landscape, culture and heritage. If you're the type that likes awards and official stamps of approval before buying your vacation, the beaches in Nosara in Costa Rica just winked at you. They're likely to become popular in 2014, thanks to the recent award of a Blue Flag -- an international certification awarded to beaches that offer top quality and environmentally friendly experiences. The 50th anniversary of the bullet train, several new festivals (in a country already in possession of some bizarre ones), a new luxurious cruise train called Seven Stars offering visitors a spectacular new way to explore the prefecture of Kyushu -- there are plenty of reasons to visit Japan in 2014. Spotting gorillas in Uganda and rhino in Kenya will become a less complicated affair in 2014 after changes to visa regulations come into effect.
"Visiting the mountain gorillas in Rwanda is a trip of a lifetime, but the magical experience itself lasts just one hour once you get up close to them," says Brad John-Davis, general manager for PEAK Africa.
This Spanish city says it has more Michelin stars (a total of 16) per square meter than any other place in the world. It's also gearing up for its 2016 stint as European Capital of Culture. Get there before everyone else does urges Daniel Fesenmaier from Temple University's School of Tourism and Hospitality. Management.
Tallinn's beautiful old town is reason any year to head to this under-visited city, but in 2014 its most popular tourist attraction will become significantly more accessible, thanks to plans to complete excavation of the tunnels beneath the famous bastion walls. A Titanic Artifact exhibition has also recently opened, hosting several gala dinners inspired by the last night on the doomed ship.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New Zealand government threw $50 million into the construction of the Nga Haerenga cycle trails
Nosara in Costa Rica recently awarded a Blue Flag -- a certification awarded to world's best beaches First few months of 2014 best period for Northern Lights for years, as NASA scientists predict a peak in solar activity
(CNN) -- Wondering where to go for your next holiday? Experts explain which destinations we should be checking out in 2014.
Brazil: The World Cup
The modern game of football, or soccer, may have been born in England's public schools, but many will claim its soul has settled in Brazil.
It has the world's most successful international team, winning the World Cup five times. It calls what many claim to be the world's greatest player, Pele, one of its own. And company managers and bosses are known to demand their employees skip work to watch the big games.
The World Cup next year then, to be hosted over June and July in 18 cities across the country, is likely to be memorable, to say the least.
Throw in the rest of the country, which includes rainforests, beaches and a party culture that makes most New Year's Eve soirees look decidedly po-faced, and you have the makings of an epic trip.
Daisy Parker from ABTA (Association of British Travel Agents) suggests visiting some of the country's more remote areas.
"The Brazilians' love of a party is going to make it a must-visit long haul destination for 2014," she says.
"Once fans have flown that far we predict many will stay on to check out areas like the Amazon basin and the amazing Iguazu Falls. Brazil's beaches are also some of the best in the world."
Explore offers a 14-day Pure Brazil tour, which starts from $5,913 per person (not including flights).

The canal's but one great thing to visit here.
The Panama Canal's 100-year anniversary arguably is not, in and of itself, a top five reason for visiting the country in 2014.
But the events surrounding the big day and Panama's other attractions certainly are.
"August 2014 marks 100 years since the completion of the Panama Canal, and that's likely to attract more attention to the destination," says Mary Moses, general manager at PEAK South America.
"However, Panama has a lot more to offer travelers than just the canal -- volcanoes, rainforests, coffee plantations and beautiful beaches on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts."
Peregrine Adventures offers a 10-day Panama Highlights tour. Prices start from $2,171 per person (excluding flights).

Myanmar: Tourism 'Master Plan'
Myanmar has been touted as "the next big tourism destination" for a few years already, but getting around the country has proved tricky.
ATMs have been absent or limited to locals only, the Internet was something nobody appeared to have heard of and travel was restricted to places the government was happy for you to see.
That's started to change already, and next year it's going to accelerate.
"The Myanmar Ministry of Hotels and Tourism has prepared a 'Master Plan' and 'Responsible Tourism Policy' to map out the future of tourism in the country," says Professor Donald E. Hawkins, Eisenhower Professor of Tourism Policy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
"The goal in 2014 is to maximize tourism's contribution to national employment and income generation while ensuring the social and economic benefits of tourism are distributed equitably."
Explore offers a 14-day Myanmar highlights tour. Prices start from $2,324 per person (excluding flights). MORE: Is now a good time to go to Myanmar? Lake Myvatn, Iceland: Best Northern Lights for years
"With NASA scientists predicting that an 11-year cycle of solar activity will peak this winter, for the first few months of 2014 the Northern Lights are expected to put on their most spectacular display for the next decade," says David Phillips, operations manager for Explorers Astronomy Tours.
"Although a viewing of the aurora borealis can never be guaranteed, you can boost your chances by heading to the beautiful and more remote areas such as northern Iceland so that you are well away from light pollution."
Discover the World offers a range of Iceland-based tours, with prices starting from $329 per person (excluding flights).

Beautiful investment.
In the last few months Ecuador's new Minister of Tourism, Vinicio Alvarado, announced a $600 million investment in tourism over the next four years, a hike of more than 300%, as part of a plan to become a "tourism powerhouse."
Earlier this year a new international airport opened in Quito. A new luxury train just started operations and the country continues to be the world's best place to retire, according to International Living.
In short, it's probably the best vacation spot you haven't yet considered, unless your name's Julian Assange.
"Ecuador is evolving fast, and a visit to this Andean nation has never been more tempting," says Rough Guides editor Eleanor Aldridge. "
"The re-launch of the Tren Crucero, a century-old railway between Guayaquil and Quito, garnered one of the British Guild of Travel Writers' top awards for 2013."
GA Adventures offers an eight-day Ecuador Quest tour. Prices start from $1,067 per person (excluding flights).

If doing more exercise is one your 2014 resolutions (and this time you mean it), an extended trip to New Zealand could provide the means.
In 2014 the country will complete its enormous Nga Haerenga cycle trail, designed to showcase the best of the country's landscape, culture and heritage.
The 2,500-kilometer network is made up of 23 shorter trails covering both the North and South islands, and the final two will be completed in January.
The New Zealand government threw $50 million into the construction of these trails, which snake through lush rainforests, glacial-fed lakes and along old railway lines once used by miners during the Gold Rush.
New Zealand-based tour operator Natural High offer a 17-day cycle tour from Auckland on the North Island to Christchurch on the South island. Prices start from $4,223 (excluding flights).

Playas de Nosara, Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: Officially approved beaches
If you're the type that likes awards and official stamps of approval before buying your vacation, the beaches in Nosara in Costa Rica just winked at you.
They're likely to become popular in 2014, thanks to the recent award of a Blue Flag -- an international certification awarded to beaches that offer top quality and environmentally friendly experiences.
Alvin Rosenbaum, an expert in tourism and senior visiting scholar at George Washington University's International Institute of Tourism Studies, says: "Its pristine beaches are responsible for the introduction of an array of new activities for families with children, ranging from toddlers' programs to educational and volunteer programs for older children.
"Nosara prides itself on its beaches and wildlife refuges and is now one of the most environmentally-aware communities in Latin America."
Hands Up Holidays offers a 10-day Nicoya Explorer tour. Prices start from $3,745 per person (excluding flights).

First bullet trains, now luxury.
The 50th anniversary of the bullet train, several new festivals (in a country already in possession of some bizarre ones), a new luxurious cruise train called Seven Stars offering visitors a spectacular new way to explore the prefecture of Kyushu -- there are plenty of reasons to visit Japan in 2014.
"The first official International Cool Japan Awards and POP Matsuri (festival), will take place in Osaka between March 21 and 30, 2014," says Kylie Clark from the Japanese National Tourism Organisation.
"Categories will include manga, anime and gaming, and during the festival numerous events will be held throughout the city tied to Japanese pop culture."
Inside Japan Tours offers a 14-night Best of Japan tour. Prices start from $3,104 per person (excluding flights).

"Visiting the mountain gorillas in Rwanda is a trip of a lifetime, but the magical experience itself lasts just one hour once you get up close to them," says Brad John-Davis, general manager for PEAK Africa.
"From January 1, travelers to East Africa will be able to visit Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda on a single visa, which will make it much easier to combine gorilla viewing with other incredible wildlife experiences across East Africa, such as tracking chimps in Uganda and spotting the big five in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park."
Intrepid offers four-day gorilla safaris starting from $4,120 per person, excluding flights.

San Sebastián, Spain: A future 'world's best city'?
It's already tied in fifth place on one list of the world's best cities, and it's likely to get even more popular soon, as San Sebastián will be the European Capital of Culture in 2016.
"I think it's important to get there before the masses discover this destination," says Daniel Fesenmaier from Temple University's School of Tourism and Hospitality Management.
"It's next to France and some of the best wine regions, including Rioja, located just to the south, and Bordeaux in France, just to the north. The food is San Sebastián is also fantastic."
If you don't know what a pintxo is, or how it tastes, now's the time to find out.
Intrepid Travel offers an eight-day Northern Spain Overview tour. Prices start from $2,543 per person (excluding flights).

The city also has a number of relatively new attractions, including the Lennusadam Seaplane Harbour Museum, where visitors can check out several seaplanes housed within spectacular hangars.
The museum has recently opened a Titanic Artefact exhibition that examines the history of the doomed ship; in early 2014, the museum will host several gala dinners inspired by the last night in the first-class area of the ship.
Baltic Tours offer a two-night city break in Tallinn. Prices start from $225 per person.

Loggerhead sea turtles go the distance
Loggerhead sea turtles travel from their birth place in Japan to their feeding grounds in Baja, Mexico, and back to Japan.
July 19, 1999
Web posted at: 1:27 p.m. EDT (1727 GMT)
Like their cousin the tortoise, sea turtles may take their time, but they are remarkably persistent, according to new evidence from an Earthwatch sponsored researcher. A satellite tag was recovered in Baja, Mexico, from the flipper of a Loggerhead sea turtle that was tagged in Japan. The tag confirms that endangered loggerheads shuttle nearly 7,500 miles (12,000 kilometers) each way across the Pacific Ocean between nesting beaches in Japan and feeding grounds off the coast of Mexico.
"A paucity of tag returns is common in sea turtle research,
making this a great find," researcher Dr. Wallace J. Nichols said. "The small turtle, which began its journey as a 6 inch (16 cm), hand-sized juvenile, made the 12,000-plus kilometer trip in the time it has taken me to get my Ph.D.  six years!" he said.
In 1996, Nichols, a Marshall Fellow at the University of Arizona's School of
Renewable Natural Resources, had satellite-tagged an adult female Loggerhead
turtle named Adelita. Over the course of 11 months in 1996-97, he
tracked her from Baja 10,000 kilometers across the Pacific to nesting
grounds in Japan. This was the first indication that loggerheads made such a long journey.
But Adelita's signal was lost somewhere off the Japanese coast. Since mature sea turtles like Adelita usually return to the beach where they hatched to lay eggs, Nichols figured that, in turn, juvenile loggerhead turtles hatched in Japan must be migrating
across the Pacific, feeding and maturing off Baja before returning to Japan to
nest, but he had no proof of the first half of the huge migration loop.
The exciting evidence came from a Mexican fisherman who reported finding a
flipper tag on a different loggerhead with a Japanese return address. However, the tag
had been on his key chain for five years. The fisherman had initially been afraid to
report his capture of an endangered species but over time he began to trust the researchers, Nichols said.
"Because of our work with the fishing communities
collecting turtle information over the past several years," Nichols said, "this fellow finally felt comfortable sharing the tag."
"Baja fishermen have provided great support for the project and have a vested interest in sea turtle recovery as turtles are a traditional
food source  one that is still used regularly."
Nichols confirmed that the tag is from a turtle hatched on Yakushima Island, where a third of Japan's loggerheads nest, and the exact beach Nichols was visiting. The hatchling was raised for one year at the Okinawa Aquarium by Drs. Teruya
and Uchida, tagged with the small metal tag bearing #572, and released in
1988. Six years later it was captured in San Carlos, Baja California by the fisherman.
Nichols said one Japanese researcher, Naoki Kamezaki, estimated the Japanese adult loggerhead population at a few thousand. "It's quite difficult to guess at the total population," he said.
"I hope that this trip marks the beginning of many years of close collaboration
between U.S., Mexican and Japanese researchers, fishermen and conservationists
in our efforts to recover Pacific Loggerhead populations," Nichols said.
