WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Just look at former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner's (D) fundraising as of late and there is no question he is running for president.Warner raised more than $1.1 million last month for his Forward Together political action committee and he has $4 million in the bank to help pay for travel, staff and make strategic contributions to candidates in key states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina as he explores a White House bid. (See below for the Latest 2008 PAC rundown).He also unveiled a new networking effort Wednesday that will eventually give 10 Democratic candidates $5,000 each with one of them getting the "grand prize" of having Warner host a fundraiser. Modeled after the NCAA March Madness college brackets, Warner's political supporters will choose five winners each from the East and West and from this pool a grand prize winner will be announced."Mark Warner is building a presidential campaign that involves raising a lot of money early and spending some money," said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report and a columnist for Roll Call. "This is the only vehicle for Mark Warner to raise money so this is where we see he is running for president and putting together a national operation."Rothenberg is referring to the fundraising efforts by other potential 2008 Democratic candidates such as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York) and Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), who are raising money in other federal accounts. For example, Clinton only has $100,000 in her PAC, but she has about $20 million in her Senate campaign account. And while Kerry's PAC shows a balance of $500,000, he has more than $14 million in other federal accounts.On the Republican side, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tennessee) and Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) have most actively employed their leadership PACs to explore presidential bids. (See below for the Latest 2008 PAC rundown).Rothenberg describes these "leadership" PACs as "getting around money ... to help collect chits and show the flag around the country."Getting around is precisely what Warner needs to do in the coming months as he tries to build a national base and position himself as the alternative to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York). Today, Warner kicks off the NDN's annual meeting in Washington.The latest 2008 PAC rundownFederal political action committees are often used by potential presidential candidates to help pay for travel, staff and as a pool of money to make donations from to candidates in key states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. CNN's Robert Yoon gives Grind readers the latest look at some possible 2008 candidates' leadership PACs.Raised in May 2006Democrats:Wesley Clark (D) - WesPAC: $25,544Hillary Clinton (D-NY) - Hill PAC: $122,479Russ Feingold (D-WI) - Progressive Patriots Fund $270,968John Kerry (D-MA) - Keeping America's Promise $270,848Mark Warner (D-VA) - Forward Together PAC $1,129,893Republicans:Bill Frist (R-TN) - Volunteer PAC $466,211Rudy Giuliani (R-NY) - Solutions America $159,022Chuck Hagel (R-NE) - Sandhills PAC $19,469John McCain (R-Arizona) - Straight Talk America $488,214Spent in May 2006Democrats:Wesley Clark (D) - WesPAC: $57,805Hillary Clinton (D-NY) - Hill PAC: $150,235Russ Feingold (D-WI) - Progressive Patriots Fund: $112,402John Kerry (D-MA) - Keeping America's Promise $256,897Mark Warner (D-VA) - Forward Together PAC $508,060Republicans:Bill Frist (R-TN) - Volunteer PAC $449,052Rudy Giuliani (R-NY) - Solutions America $141,390Chuck Hagel (R-NE) - Sandhills PAC $60,400John McCain (R-Arizona) - Straight Talk America $803,517Cash on hand as of May 31, 2006Democrats:Wesley Clark (D) - WesPAC: $16,101Hillary Clinton (D-NY) - Hill PAC: $100,240Russ Feingold (D-WI) - Progressive Patriots Fund: $545,628John Kerry (D-MA) - Keeping America's Promise $501,869Mark Warner (D-VA) - Forward Together PAC $4,079,249Republicans:Bill Frist (R-TN) - Volunteer PAC $659,490Rudy Giuliani (R-NY) - Solutions America $241,294Chuck Hagel (R-NE) - Sandhills PAC $138,617John McCain (R-Arizona) - Straight Talk America $761,845Knitting together the Democratic factionsOnce a political action committee dedicated to electing centrist Democrats, the NDN has transformed itself in recent years into a center to bring the various factions of the Democratic Party together. Today, the organization kicks off a two day conference and will hear from three potential presidential candidates: former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner (D), Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York) and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack (D) as well as liberal blogger Marko Moulitsas and Service Employees International Union official Eliseo Medina."We believe the only way we are going to succeed as modern progressives or new Democrats is by the whole progressive movement succeeding," NDN President Simon Rosenberg said in an interview with the Grind earlier this week. "We are really trying to help everyone work together. Our ideas and values are not going to win the big debate right now unless the whole progressive movement wins."And Rosenberg said he thinks Democrats want to hear potential presidential candidates explain their plan of "how we are going to get back into power.""Democrats want to win and there is a lot of optimism about '08 being a good year," he said.Lincoln saves ClintonSen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York) owes Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) a bowl of Senate bean soup for helping her dodge questions last night about a possible 2008 presidential run. Clinton and Lincoln appeared alongside the seven other Democratic women senators to discuss politics and policy on CNN's "Larry King Live." But when King asked the senators if they would support Clinton if she decided to run for the White House, the New York Democrat unsuccessfully tried to steer the conversation in another direction. That is when Lincoln stepped in."She wants to take one step at a time and get it right," Lincoln said, referring to Clinton's Senate re-election campaign.The comment gave Clinton the split second time she needed to regroup."We want to focus on what we can get done in this Congress," Clinton said. "And then we need to focus on our elections in November because, as you say, we're running for re-election."But we must note, Clinton never ruled out running for the White House in 2008.Edwards poverty crusadeFormer Sen. John Edwards (D-North Carolina) continues his crusade to end poverty today outlining a plan to do so over the next 30 years during a lunchtime speech at the National Press Club. Edwards, who is considering another run for the White House, will also speak to the current debate among Democrats about the future direction of the party."I believe in a party willing to take stances that are right, whether or not they are popular," Edwards will say, according to advanced excerpts of his speech provided to CNN. "This is the tradition of America, fighting for what is right regardless of the odds, regardless of the power of those on the other side. It is what the Democratic Party I believe in is all about. We do not have to posture or to accept mediocrity or compromise our values. We can decide to be great, we can address great problems, we can see great possibilities."Edwards will also say that if Democrats want to be leaders, "we have to represent something greater than our own self-promotion."We have to believe that our country is more important than ourselves," Edwards will say. "These times are critical, so let me be clear: in this battle for the soul of our Party, no less than the future of America and the future of the world are at stake."The vote to pull out of IraqThe Senate is scheduled to vote around 11 a.m. on two different Democratic proposals concerning U.S. troops in Iraq. The first amendment -- that is supported by the Democratic leadership -- calls for the beginning of redeploying troops by year's end and requires President Bush to submit a more detailed redeployment plan to Congress. The second plan -- being advanced by Sens. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) -- calls for the withdrawal of troops by July 1, 2007. Both amendments are expected to fail with the leadership backed plan getting close to 40 votes and Kerry-Feingold attracting as many as 15 supporters, Democratic sources tell the Grind."Today, the real choice facing this body is a choice between doing nothing �the so-called 'stay the course' option the President and his supporters advocate �or changing the course and providing our troops and the Iraqi people a way forward," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) will say just before the vote, according to excerpts of his speech provided to the Grind. Reid will not vote for the Kerry-Feingold amendment.DAYAHEAD/Events making news today...President Bush is in Budapest, Hungary, meeting with political leaders and making a speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of that country's uprising against the Soviet Union's occupation.

The U.S. and its partners are holding open the option of seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution to force Iran's hand if Tehran does not respond or if its response is unacceptable. By making a public show of unity with the Europeans, Russians and Chinese, the administration is both signaling Tehran there is little to be gained by trying to promote division and also closing ranks for any U.N. drive for sanctions against Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday that his country would respond in mid-August to the package of incentives. AP via Yahoo! News: White House seeks prompt reply from IranBUSH CALLS "THREAT" COMMENT "ABSURD": With thousands of anti-American protesters crowding Vienna's streets, an irked President Bush snapped yesterday at a suggestion U.S. foreign policy has become a threat to global security. "That's absurd," Bush barked at an Austrian reporter during a press conference with European Union President and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel. "We'll defend ourselves, but at the same time, we're actively working with our partners to spread peace and democracy.... It's an absurd statement." Europe's anti-Americanism flooded Vienna, where more than 3,000 Austrian police expected about 10,000 protesters at multiple demonstrations coinciding with the U.S.-EU summit. New York Daily News: No welcome mat for WGOP NOW "EMBRACES" IRAQ AS ELECTION ISSUE: Just a few weeks ago, some Republicans were openly fretting about the war in Iraq and its effect on their re-election prospects, with particularly vulnerable lawmakers worried that its growing unpopularity was becoming a drag on their campaigns. But there was little sign of such nervousness on Wednesday as Republican after Republican took to the Senate floor to offer an unambiguous embrace of the Iraq war and to portray Democrats as advocates of an overly hasty withdrawal that would have grave consequences for the security of the United States. Like their counterparts in the House last week, they accused Democrats of espousing "retreat and defeatism."New York Times: Rallied by Bush, Skittish G.O.P. Now Embraces War as IssueSENATORS TO VOTE ON WITHDRAWAL PLANS: Senators today will be forced to take a position on two different proposals for withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the votes coming in an election year where polls show support for the conflict is steadily declining. Democrats are sponsoring both plans, one to start a "phased redeployment" by Jan. 31, the other to pull out combat troops by July 1, 2007. Sen. John Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, spent most of last night arguing for his pullout measure, offered as an amendment to the defense authorization bill. He said the money and resources used since the Iraq war began in March 2003 have distracted the United States from the war on terror. "We want their government to stand up. The best way to stand it up is to shift responsibility," he said.Washington Times: Senate to vote on Iraq pullout LARGE PROFITS RESULT OF EARMARKS? House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) made a $2 million profit last year on the sale of land 5 1/2 miles from a highway project that he helped to finance with targeted federal funds. A Republican House member from California, meanwhile, received nearly double what he paid for a four-acre parcel near an Air Force base after securing $8 million for a planned freeway interchange 16 miles away. And another California GOP congressman obtained funding in last year's highway bill for street improvements near a planned residential and commercial development that he co-owns. In all three cases, Hastert and Reps. Ken Calvert and Gary Miller say that they were securing funds their home districts wanted badly, and that in no way did the earmarks have any impact on the land values of their investments. But for watchdog groups, the cases have opened a fresh avenue for investigation and a new wrinkle in the ongoing controversy over earmarks -- home-district projects funded through narrowly written legislative language. Washington Post: Lawmakers' Profits Are ScrutinizedSPECTER TO HOLD HIS OWN IMMIGRATION HEARINGS: One day after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives announced they will put a sweeping Senate immigration bill under summer-long scrutiny with a series of public hearings, Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., countered with plans for hearings of his own. Specter said his sessions, beginning July 5 and lasting through the summer, will highlight "the need for a comprehensive bill" instead of the more narrowly focused border-security legislation that the House approved last December. USA Today: Republicans plan dueling hearings on immigrationBLOOMBERG, WILLIAMS TALK TERROR CUTS ON THE HILL: Protecting major American cities against terrorism requires investing federal dollars not just in high-tech gadgets but also in police officers working in uniform and under cover, the mayors of New York and Washington told a House committee on Wednesday. The joint message, from Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Anthony A. Williams of Washington, came as the two protested a plan by the Department of Homeland Security to cut grants to the cities by 40 percent in the coming year... [T]heir allotments were cut, at least in part, because of plans to use the money to pay police officers instead of investing in antiterrorism tools or training, Mr. Bloomberg told the House Committee on Homeland Security, calling such a choice shortsighted. New York Times: Mayors Protest Cuts in Antiterrorism FundsWILLIAMS' LAST CANNONBALL: D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams made his last cannonball dive into a city swimming pool Wednesday morning. Since 1999, Williams has marked the beginning of the city's summer parks and recreation program with a dive into a city pool. News4's Tom Sherwood reported Wednesday that Williams probably holds the record for mayoral cannonballs, eight in eight years. "I'm hoping that my legacy will be that my successor, whoever that successor is, will do an annual cannonball," said Williams. NBC4: Mayor Makes Last Cannonball To Open PoolsBID TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE KILLED IN SENATE: A battle over whether to raise the minimum wage is spilling into the hard-fought congressional races, with several Democratic challengers staging campaign events on the issue and Democrats promising to increase the wage as one of their first acts should they win control of Congress... The fight heated up Wednesday as the Senate rejected a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to boost the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over the next two years. The vote was 52-46 in favor of the higher wage, with eight Republicans joining Democrats to back the change, but that left proponents eight votes short of the 60 necessary to prevail under a parliamentary deal between the two parties. Chicago Tribune: Senate kills minimum pay boostMOLLOHAN HELPED WIN CONTRACTS FOR HIS CHARITY'S BENEFACTORS: Representative Alan Mollohan helped funnel at least $179 million in U.S. government contracts over the last six years to companies that gave to the West Virginia Democrat's family-run charity, tax records and other documents show. The money went to 21 companies and nonprofit groups that contributed $225,427 to the Robert H. Mollohan Family Charitable Foundation in 2004 -- almost half of the charity's revenue, according to the documents. The congressman, an Appropriations Committee member whose finances are under federal investigation, is the secretary of the foundation, which is named for his father. The charity, which distributes scholarships to West Virginia students, raises most of its money from corporate sponsors of an annual golf tournament attended by Mollohan, 63. The event gives company executives an opportunity to meet with him in a casual setting without having to report the donations as lobbying expenses. Bloomberg: Mollohan Helped Steer U.S. Contracts to Family-Charity DonorsAG. DEPT. HIT BY HACKER: A hacker broke into the Agriculture Department's computer system and may have obtained names, Social Security numbers and photos of 26,000 Washington-area employees and contractors, the department said Wednesday. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said the department will provide free credit monitoring for one year to anyone who might have been affected. The break-in happened during the first weekend in June, the department said. Technology staff learned of the breach on June 5 and told Johanns the following day but believed personal information was protected by security software, the department said. AP via Yahoo! News: Hacker enters Agriculture dept. computersSENATORS REFRAIN FROM PICKING A FAVORITE '08 COLLEAGUE: By the time the smoke clears from the 2006 elections, Senators on both sides of the aisle will be confronted with an unwelcome question: Who are you backing for president? For now, though, most of them are running away from the question of which Senator, of the 12 potential candidates now being talked about, gets their endorsement for president. "I don't expect to be picking a horse," said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). "It's really not my vote that counts. It's the vote of the Republican primary voters." "They're working very hard to get people on board," said one GOP Senate aide of the would-be presidents. "But unless it's a home-state Senator, they're asking a lot this far out. Tough to stick your neck out like that this early." Roll Call: Who's Your Favorite? Senators Stay Mum SPITZER LEADS BY AT LEAST 40 IN NY: Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is holding on to a huge lead over his two opponents - Republican John Faso and Democrat Tom Suozzi - in the race for governor, a new poll yesterday showed. The Quinnipiac University survey found Faso making no significant gains against Democrat Spitzer since knocking former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld out of the GOP primary earlier this month. Democrat Spitzer led Faso, a former Assembly minority leader, by a lopsided 66-20 percent, compared to the 67-16 percent lead he held a month ago. The poll of 1,204 registered voters also found Spitzer leading Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, 76-13 percent, compared to a 73-13 percent lead held by Spitzer four weeks ago. New York Post: Spitzer Miles Ahead in PollMI GOV RACE NEARLY TIED IN POLLS: Michigan's gubernatorial race between Democratic incumbent Jennifer Granholm and Republican challenger Dick DeVos is close, according to a poll released Wednesday. Forty-six percent of 600 likely voters said they would vote for DeVos, while 44 percent said they would vote for Granholm. Ten percent were undecided. The poll, by Lansing-based EPIC-MRA, had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points. AP via Yahoo! News: Poll shows Michigan governor race close Story Tools

Abu Dhabi launches English language newspaperStory Highlights "The National" the Abu Dhabi-based national broadsheet launched Wednesday Martin Newland, former Daily Telegraph editor is the paper's Editor-in-chief It is owned by the Abu Dhabi government and backed by Sheikh Mohammed The Emirates already has five daily newspapers catering to English speakersNext Article in World Business » (CNN) -- On Wednesday, at the glittering Emirates Palace hotel, in front of a who's who of the United Arab Emirates, the front page of the world's newest daily broadsheet was unveiled. The world's newest daily newspaper Editor-in-chief, Martin Newland, former editor of the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph newspaper, showed the new Abu Dhabi paper off to an audience which included Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. "The National" has been designed in the style of a British broadsheet and aims to give the capital of the United Arab Emirates a public voice. It has an editorial team of 200 -- including a host of former Daily Telegraph employees hired by Newland -- which is the largest working on an English-language daily in the Middle East. Among Newland's new staff is Bill Spindle, former corporate finance editor of the Wall Street Journal, who is business editor. Former Daily Telegraph Paris correspondent, Colin Randall is executive editor of the paper. "Abu Dhabi is about to have a national daily newspaper, and I hope and believe that it will be a very good one," he wrote on his blog francesalut.com in the run up to the launch. The paper's breadth of coverage is indeed impressive -- the first edition included 20 pages of business, arts, news and sport. "It is a late stage of my career to be participating, for the first time in the thrill of launching a national newspaper. "If truth be told, it is also a late stage in the career of newspapers themselves for an event of this kind to be occurring. I cannot imagine many parts of the world where anyone would think of embarking on such a project," Randall continues. "The National" is owned by an investment fund controlled by the Abu Dhabi government -- one of the richest governments in the world -- and it is yet another expression of the ambitiousness of the federation's plans for the future. In spite of the grandness of the launch, there is no obvious business case for a new daily in Abu Dhabi. Fewer than 500,000 adults with English as their mother tongue live in Emirate and there are already five daily newspapers catering for this section of the market.

Inflation could pop Gulf bubble
In fact, the most obvious gap in the market is for a popular newspaper aimed at Hindi speakers. Press freedom is another issue that is lurking under "The National's" shiny new veneer. In the run up to the launch, editor Newland glossed over the issue of editorial freedoms in the state-owned broadsheet. Sheikh Mohammed's presence at the launch is a sign of his backing and insiders say he wants a newspaper that reports on a federation-wide basis and is prepared to challenge official complacency wherever it exists. But it is impossible to say that "The National" is independent. A paper that can fearlessly criticize government policy in the federation is still a long way in the future.

(CNN) -- During Saturday night's Republican candidates' debate on national security issues, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said the United States has nowhere to take terrorists for interrogation and said the CIA does not interrogate anymore.
The statement: "When we interdict a terrorist on the battlefield, we have no jail for them. We have nowhere to take them. We have no CIA interrogation anymore," Bachmann said.
The facts: The controversial CIA "black site" prison program, where the suspect of the USS Cole bombing and others were interrogated immediately after arrest, has been dismantled. In an April 2009 letter from CIA director Leon Panetta to employees, Panetta wrote, "CIA no longer operates detention facilities or black sites and has proposed a plan to decommission the remaining sites."
However, the CIA is still interrogating terror suspects in the field in certain cases. For example, CNN reported in July that CIA operatives have secretly traveled to Mogadishu, Somalia, to help interrogate terrorism suspects about terror operations in East Africa and Yemen. While working in a "support" mode, the CIA has been present at a small amount of interrogations of suspects under the control of Somali forces. The U.S. government believes the Somali-based Al-Shabaab terror organization is increasing its links to the al Qaeda affiliate in nearby Yemen.
In a separate incident earlier this year, CNN reported that Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali whom the U.S. indicted for providing material support to al Qaeda linked groups, was interrogated for weeks by U.S. authorities on a Navy amphibious assault ship before he was transferred to FBI custody and brought to the United States to make an appearance in federal court this past July.
Verdict: Misleading

Pakistan releases nine Taliban for peace process in Afghanistan

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Taliban members released to help with peace negotiations
Afghan peace council calls for the release of more
Pakistani intelligence official is skeptical about their effectiveness (CNN) -- Pakistan has released nine members of the Taliban from prison in hopes they will help negotiate peace in Afghanistan, a senior Afghan peace negotiator said.
They are to receive safe passage back to Afghanistan, Salahuddin Rabbani, chairman of Afghanistan High Peace Council, told reporters in Kabul Saturday.
A senior Pakistani intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the release, indicating that many of the prisoners were old-guard Taliban, ranking members from generations past.
Two were once ministers in the former Taliban government before the U.S. invaded the country in 2001, he said. The rest were either former government officials or low- to mid-evel commanders.
The history of the Pakistani Taliban
Afghans hopeful for the future The peace council has attempted to forge peace between the Taliban, the Afghan government and Western powers. It supports Kabul's call to the Taliban to cut its links to al Qaeda.
The prisoner release coincided with a recent three-day visit by an Afghan delegation led by Rabbani to Islamabad, which sat down with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and religious leaders to solicit their support for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The Afghans have requested the discharge of more Taliban, who Rabbani said have agreed to support peace negotiations, and hope that this first release was the just the beginning.
The senior Pakistani intelligence official believes more releases are likely, but he is skeptical the released Taliban prisoners will be effective in peace negotiations due to generational conflicts.
"I doubt very much that the current Afghan Taliban will listen to these has-beens," he said.
A former second-in-command Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was rumored to have been considered for release but was not among those set free.
Rabbani is the son of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the peace council until his assassination in his home at the hand of suicide bombers posing as Taliban peace negotiators in 2011.
CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul and CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad.

Celebrity power couples
By Stephanie Goldberg, CNN
updated 1:31 PM EST, Thu February 14, 2013
With a combined annual income of $78 million, Jay-Z and Beyonce surpassed Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen as the highest-paid celebrity couple in 2012, according to Forbes.
From Gisele Bundchen's modeling, endorsement deals and independent licensing ventures to Tom Brady's generous contract with the New England Patriots, this power couple has a total income of $72 million. They have two children together.
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West will soon be parents of one lucky bundle of joy. The reality star pulls $18 million annually while the musician/director/artist rakes in $35 million.
Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton are country music's newest power couple. With Lambert's fourth studio album, "For the Record," debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and Shelton's judgeship on NBC's "The Voice," the pair are a musical force.
Together, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have six children, five Oscar nominations, one Academy Award and $45 million a year.
With Calista Flockhart focusing on TV and Harrison Ford starring on the big screen, the couple, who wed in 2010, have been power players for years.
Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith rake in $40 million annually. They're even more of a power couple -- or family -- when you factor in their famous offspring, Jaden and Willow.
Speaking of powerful families, Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann's children, Maude and Iris, have appeared alongside their mom in three Apatow comedies. It seems the couple that works together on hilarious movies stays together.
Together, soccer player David Beckham and his wife Victoria (the fashion designer formerly known as Posh Spice) earn $54 million a year.
While Jennifer Aniston brings in $11 million annually, her writer/director/actor fiancé Justin Theroux certainly carries his weight.
Soccer star Gerard Pique and singer Shakira welcomed their first child in January.
David Bowie and Iman married in 1992. His musical legacy coupled with her modeling career and cosmetics company makes this pair a force to be reckoned with -- not to mention that Bowie's 24th studio album is set to debut in March.
As long as "American Idol" judge Mariah Carey continues making music and Nick Cannon keeps acting and writing/producing/directing TV programs, this power couple isn't going anywhere.
Ellen DeGeneres has gained even more regular fans for her show, with "The Oprah Winfrey Show" off the air. Alone, DeGeneres rakes in $53 million annually. Add in what her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, earns from "Ally McBeal" and "Arrested Development" and you've got yourself a power couple.
With an annual income of $59 million, Ryan Seacrest could be his own power couple. His girlfriend, Julianne Hough, has starring roles in movies such as "Rock of Ages" and "Safe Haven," which comes out on Valentine's Day, for bonus power couple points.

New Zealand: Prove recreational drug is safe, then you can sell
By Madison Park, CNN
updated 5:08 AM EDT, Thu July 11, 2013
A sample of synthetic drugs is displayed by drug enforcement officials.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New Zealand Parliament passes new drug law 119-1
Recreational drug makers can sell products if they prove its safety
Law only applies to synthetic drugs, not marijuana, cocaine, etc
New Zealand is first to change its tactic on psychoactive drugs
(CNN) -- The New Zealand government wants to make sure your high is safe.
In an attempt to tackle the popularity of new-generation synthetic party drugs -- sold widely in convenience stores and blamed for triggering a spate of mental health issues -- New Zealand authorities have taken a radical new tack.
A new law shifts the onus to the makers of synthetic recreational drugs, forcing them to conduct clinical tests to prove their products are safe -- similar to the way pharmaceuticals are regulated.
It's the first nation to take a dramatically different approach to psychoactive substances like party pills and synthetic marijuana -- which the United Nations has flagged as an alarming drug problem. Some psychoactive substances go by names like bath salts, spice or meow-meow.
The hidden dangers of synthetic drugs

Big bust on 'bath salts' operation
In a 119-to-1 vote on Thursday, the country's parliament passed the Psychoactive Substances Bill, establishing a framework for testing, manufacturing and selling such recreational drugs.
The new law does not apply to non-synthetic drugs like marijuana, cocaine or magic mushrooms.
In a country that prides itself as a "social laboratory," New Zealand has become "a laboratory in every sense: for the approval of new recreational drugs," according to an editorial in the New Zealand Herald.
The drug law enjoyed broad support although there was debate over whether animal testing would be required in the clinical tests.
"While other countries are still blindly banning drug after drug, the Psychoactive Substances Bill will put New Zealand ahead of the industry's game," said Ross Bell, the New Zealand Drug Foundation's executive director in a statement in support of the law. "It is a comprehensive, pragmatic and innovative approach to address a complex problem."
This contrasts with countries where substances are legal until the governments ban them. Chemical concoctions come out fairly routinely -- far outpacing efforts to control them.
When one product is banned, "there are two or three or four replacements in the market," said Bell.
And authorities can't prevent the drug makers from selling new concoctions.
"You can't ban what yet doesn't exist," Bell said. "The government isn't in the position to pre-empt these things."
New Zealand is unique because of its remote geography, he added.
"It's because we're a small remote country," he said. "Drugs like heroine don't make their way to New Zealand. What we've become good at doing is making our own drugs."
Psychoactive substances have raised concerns over their ingredients and effects. Some are known to cause paranoia, hallucinations, convulsions and psychotic episodes.
"In lots of ways, this synthetic cannabis is way worse than the real stuff with a number of people who are becoming psychotic as a result," said Dr. Mark Peterson, the chair of the New Zealand Medical Association.
Under the law, new psychoactive drugs cannot be sold unless they pass health regulations. That process will be determined by the country's Ministry of Health.
The new regulation "has to be rigorous and robust enough to stand up to public scrutiny. To be licensed, to be legal, it has to pass testing like new medicine in the market," said Grant Hall, general manager of the advocacy group, The Star Trust, which represents members of the legal high industry in the country.
The industry wants to "be recognized as other highs" such as alcohol and tobacco, he added.
Hall said he expects the industry to take a hit on profits as they'll now have to submit costly and lengthy applications to be be sold on the market. But he views it as an investment.
"You have take a long term view," Hall said. "It's a legitimate industry that provides certified low-risk product so people can enjoy them safely. That's a much better business model than the better cat-and-mouse game the industry plays with the government."
Here is what else the Psychoactive Substances Bill entails:
- Restricts where and how psychoactive drugs are sold
- Prohibits sales to minors
- Restricts labeling and packaging of products
- Gives existing products a grace period to begin application process

Deborra-lee Furness: Fight the global orphan crisis
By Deborra-lee Furness, Special to CNN
updated 1:11 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2013
Deborra-lee Furness with Malawi orphans during a trip to Africa with former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Furness: Number of children globally who have lost both parents nearly equals population of Australia
While vulnerable to corruption, the problems of overseas adoption should be solved, not shuttered
Governments like Russia have used international adoption as a political chess piece with the U.S.
Furness established Adoption Awareness Week Australia to shed light on the orphan plight
Editor's note: Deborra-lee Furness is an Australian actress, director, producer and child advocate. She is founder of National Adoption Awareness Week and executive director for the Worldwide Orphans Foundation in Australia, and a World Vision Ambassador. She and her husband, actor Hugh Jackman, have two adopted children.
(CNN) -- How can it be that the number of vulnerable and abandoned children is increasing and the numbers of children finding their "forever families" through adoption is decreasing?
I cannot get my head around this shocking fact. What happens to all these kids who desperately need someone to advocate for their very existence? Where do they go? Who do they turn to? How do they survive?
There are an estimated 151 million orphans in the world, which UNICEF defines as a child that's lost one or more parent. If they were a country, they would together form the 10th largest nation in the world. An estimated 18 million of those have lost both parents -- a figure which would represent 80% of the population of my home country, Australia. I try to imagine what that visual looks like, if one were to Google Map it and hone in on one face staring back at you, wondering if there is anyone out there that cares about them and their circumstance.
Deborra-Lee Furness and husband Hugh Jackman.
The Jackmans with children Oscar and Ava at Disneyland in 2009.
I am not a learned scholar or professional worker in international adoption. I am not even an adoption advocate -- I am a child advocate. I am an individual who has witnessed what life is like for children who don't have anyone to watch their back, or teach them right from wrong, to care about what they think or feel, or the basic human need to feel loved, to feel safe and secure and to feel that they actually matter. I believe everyone deserves be the object of someone's affection.
This journey for me began six years ago when I addressed an article I read in my local newspaper in Australia about adoption. After speaking with the paper and getting the headline the next day, I realized this issue needed a voice in Australia. Many people from the community implored me to keep speaking as there was so much frustration surrounding adoption. The main grievance for families was the difficultly to adopt in Australia, where couples could wait as long as 10 years.
I am still talking six years on, having established Adoption Awareness Week Australia. It's a no brainer for me: You have loving families wanting to care for these kids and kids that desperately need a loving home. We just have to work out a way to put these two together.
In my mind one of the greatest crimes of humanity is to take away the innocence of a child, and this is in essence what we are doing if we do not step up and take a look at what is happening to abandoned children all over the world.
In my mind one of the greatest crimes of humanity is to take away the innocence of a child.Deborra-lee Furness
These kids have literally no self-esteem, they are depressed and without hope and often in extreme danger of exploitation and abuse. If they are not able to be placed with a permanent family, they are either on the streets and prey to abusive predators or being institutionalized and therefore subject to serious mental health and developmental issues.
Many are caught in the foster care system, whereby they are always vulnerable to being moved from family to family and never have a sense of belonging. The lack of permanency for these kids has a huge effect on their safety and security. Sadly, the trajectory for many kids who age out of the foster care system is homelessness, crime, drugs and incarceration, to name a few of the horrors. These kids are stuck, because governments cannot work out how to parent them.
Intercountry adoption is vulnerable because of corruption of the system.
Profiteering and child trafficking has understandably caused great concern and is the reason why The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption was created to combat such abuse. But it should not be the reason to close down programs that serve so many children. Greater measures of accountability need to be in place to combat the rotten part of the system, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
What needs to be addressed is the systemic core of the sending countries. We need to assist countries that have been rife with poverty and war and lack of education for decades. Until we can get at the core of why there are so many young women and unborn/newborn babies with no real support, they will always be vulnerable. By getting to the root of the problems, there is the possibility of creating an environment that will serve families and there will be fewer abandoned children that need to find another family.
My dream would be that there would be no need for adoption and that every child could remain with birth families. When adoption is the best option for these kids, I totally advocate for a well-run system that serves these children and families
I believe the biggest reason that intercountry adoption does not work at an optimum is because we have not put in the mind power and energy and resources needed to create a system that works ethically and expediently.
Some governments don't rate abandoned childrens' issues high on their agenda, unless children are being used as a political pawn, as we witnessed late last year when Russia closed down their program with the U.S.
Even the Russian Children's Rights Commissioner made a statement saying "I think any foreign adoption is bad for the country." Bad for the "country," not specifically bad for the "children."
Thousands of children will have to pay the hefty price of that decision, as they will be institutionalized for the remainder of their childhood, never finding a family of their own.
I implore everyone to speak up on this matter. You don't have to adopt a child to show that you care. Just by acknowledging their existence and maybe doing something as simple as taking a minute to think about their plight may lead to a movement, a change, a chance for a better life.

Overseas adoptions in steep decline
updated 6:52 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2013
After rising for decades, the number of overseas adoptions has dropped by almost half since 2004. In this series, CNN probes the reasons behind the decline and whether the trend could -- or should -- be reversed.

updated 1:52 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2013
International adoptions steadily rose since the 1950s before exploding in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the opening of China and Russia. But for the past decade its been in freefall.

Advocates say international adoption system is holding orphans hostage in red tape. Critics say adoption from developing nations feeds nefarious practices. A "business" in need of reform.
