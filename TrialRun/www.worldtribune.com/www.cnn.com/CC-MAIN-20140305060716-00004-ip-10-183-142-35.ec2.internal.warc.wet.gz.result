The storyA moving graph at the bottom of the CNN screen during Tuesday night's presidential debate measured the reactions of uncommitted voters in the swing state of Ohio, and it seemed to bear out the theory that negative campaigning draws negative voter reactions.Nearly every time one candidate threw a jab at the other, the voter reaction dipped measurably.The dips were minor for small digs but slipped further if a candidate continued criticizing his opponent.

Names that flout convention: Advice for Jessica Simpson's daughter
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Emanuella Grinberg, CNN
updated 1:00 PM EDT, Tue May 8, 2012
Raphael Larrinaga "didn't realize the enormous impact my Hispanic name would have on my life until I started job hunting in the '80s." Larrinaga thinks he got much further in job interviews when he started going by the nickname "Ray." He was once even told by an interviewer that he didn't "look like a Raphael." "I think things have changed quite a bit for the better, but can't help but wonder how many people still judge someone they've never met simply by what kind of name they have," Larrinaga says.
Ryan Babarsky is used to it by now -- all the letters and phone calls for "Mr. Babarsky." She says it was hard as a kid, with people asking if her parents wished she was a boy, but now she really likes her name. "I've developed a thicker skin than I probably would have otherwise, and gosh darnit, people almost always remember my name," says Babarsky.
"I am a 60-year-old male who is decidedly heterosexual," says Kim Manlove. Nevertheless, he has experienced others' confusion and teasing about his gender and sexual orientation all his life. Wondering about the origin of such a name? "'Manlove' is an ancient Anglo Saxon name from the Middle Ages which means philanthropist," he says.
Michael Howell once asked her mother why she chose a traditionally male name for her daughter. The answer was simple: Her mom just liked it. But still, Howell says, "It's hard for me to figure out [why] a parent does this; are they looking for attention? Because the only attention the child's going to get is going to be negative attention." At 67, Howell says she has made peace with her name -- though she made sure to give her children "very common, normal names."
Allana James Mathews -- pronounced "AL-anna" -- was named after her grandfather, James Allan. "When I was a child, I hated my 'made up' name," she says. "But now that I have grown up, it means something special to me since I never had the chance to get to know my grandpa."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
iReporters share stories of living with names associated with different race, gender
Playground bullies would ask Michael Howell's children why their mother had a sex change
Kim Manlove says being teased for his name taught him compassion for others
"People still have special ideas about what names mean," female Ryan Babarsky says
(CNN) -- Raphael Larrinaga was tired of sending out job applications and not getting a response, so he decided to try a different approach.
No, he didn't embellish a job title or fabricate a master's degree on his résumé. Instead, he swapped out his Spanish first name for something with more "Americanized," something that people would expect from a guy with blond hair and blue eyes job-hunting in Utah in the 1980s.
Almost instantly, Ray Larrinaga began getting calls back, he said. Within two weeks, he accepted a job with a bank and went back to the name his Spanish-born parents had given him.
"People said I was paranoid, but I'm not exaggerating a bit," said Larrinaga, now a self-employed graphic designer. "I went from almost a zero response to my applications to over 50 percent response."
In hindsight, the resident of Bountiful, Utah, said he's a little ashamed of his ploy. Sure, he could be a chameleon and scuttle his Spanish roots if he wanted to, but visible minorities can't get rid of their accent or change the color of their skin, he said.
"That was a real eye opener for me, as I realized how tough it was for minorities in my mostly 'white' community to get an even break," said Larrinaga, who shared his story on iReport. "I think things have changed quite a bit for the better, but I can't help but wonder how many people still judge someone they've never met simply by what kind of name they have."
Our names say a lot about us even before the first encounter, as Larrinaga and others can attest. Just ask Jessica Simpson, whose decision to name her daughter Maxwell Drew Johnson sparked criticism that she was condemning the child to a life of torture for having a traditionally male name.
In America: What does your name say about you?
CNN iReporters shared the good and the bad of living with a name that flouts convention. As children, they endured playground taunts and teases. By the time they reach adulthood, they've heard it all and spent countless hours patiently (or sometimes not so patiently) explaining their names to strangers. They're used to second takes from bank tellers and waiters, mail addressed to Mr. when it should be a Mrs., and vice-versa.
"It's hard for me to figure out why a parent does this," iReporter Michael Howell said. "Are they looking for attention? Because the only attention the child's going to get is going to be negative attention. I'm curious as to why mothers do this."
Howell never got a satisfactory answer from her mother as to why she gave her a boy's name. Howell said she could write a book about the lifetime of confusion and insults she has experienced because of her name, the hours spent convincing people that Michael is indeed her real name.
No, she was not dodging the Vietnam War draft in the 1960s. No, she's never had a sex change. Yes, that really is her name, she tells clients who call the real estate office where she works. Really.
Her children suffered a great deal for it, too, she said. They can laugh now at the cruel jokes, but at the time, it was devastating for them. Looking back, it made her a bit of a shut-in, she said. She avoided going out or engaging neighbors for fear of having to explain herself.

But by the time she reached 55, she was over it, she said, and she hopes the world is kinder to Maxwell Drew. Otherwise, the best advice she can offer is to stick it out and stick close to people who are nice.
"I've made it this far. What am I going to do, change my name? What would people who've known me all my life call me?" said Howell, now 67. "I came in with it, I'm going out with it."
One benefit is that people rarely forget her name, she said, a common sentiment from those whose names defy societal norms.
It might have been the worst thing ever as a child, but many say they have persevered and developed a thicker skin because of it. Some have even managed to embrace their traitorous names as a badge of honor that has shaped who they are.
"It has helped me understand and appreciate that we are who we are and not what we are called or named," said Kim Manlove, who shared his story on iReport.
The 60-year-old "decidedly heterosexual" male has experienced a fair share of taunts over the years. As a child, his last name was the bigger problem with "you must love men" being a common, if unimaginative refrain.
As an adult, his first name tripped up people who assumed it must be short for Kimber or Kimball. And, he still can't get those callers looking for breast cancer research volunteers to take his name off the list, he said.
"Despite a lifetime of teasing, snide comments and the occasional unwelcome advance, having the name Kim Manlove has helped instill in me a certain amount of humility and compassion. Compassion for others who through no fault or choice of their own may bear some disability or mark, seen or unseen, that draws the unwanted attention of others whose ignorance or prejudice leads them to make some hurtful or stigmatizing remark or gesture."
A snide remark from a customer service rep once caught iReporter Ryan Babarsky off guard at the pet store. Being accustomed to the drill, she obliged when he asked to see her credit card to look up her rewards number. But she didn't have a response to his question, "Did your parents want you to be a boy?"
"I'm not going to stand in the store and yell at somebody because they're narrow-minded," the 26-year-old business analyst said. "I share stories on my blog and tell my fiancé, just to have someone to confide in."
Otherwise, she feels her name suits her. As a child she was a bit of a tomboy and people seemed to give her a pass because she had a boy's name, she said.
As an adult, she enjoys standing out without really having to try, and wouldn't dream of changing her name.
"I've learned a lot about people and expectations," she said. "You'd think in 2012 that people would be open about gender and names ... but apparently people still have special ideas about what names mean and who they belong to."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Austria's capital Vienna was rated the best city to live by Mercer
Eight out of the top 10 cities with highest quality of life are located in Europe
The worst city to live of the 221 surveyed around the globe is Baghdad, Iraq
The survey takes 39 factors, such as crime rates and medical care, into account
(CNN) -- Vienna, famous for its hundreds of museums, 2000 parks and of course its roasted coffee, is the best place on the planet to live, according to Mercer's 2012 Quality of Living Index. This year's latest accolade makes Vienna number one in the world for the fourth year in a row.
The annual survey by the global human resources consulting firm points not just to Austria's qualities but to much of the region's virtues. Eight of the report's top 10 cities are in Europe. Zurich is the world's second most livable city while three German cities -- Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt -- follow close behind.
"Overall, European cities continue to have high quality of living as a result of a combination of increased stability, rising living standards and advanced city infrastructures," said Slagin Parakatil, Senior Researcher at Mercer. This is despite economic turmoil, political tension and high unemployment in some European countries.
Australian, New Zealand and Canadian metropolises round out the top ten list.
The world's top 30 cities of the Mercer 2012 index
1. Vienna, Austria
2. Zurich, Switzerland
3. Auckland, New Zealand
4. Munich, Germany
5. Vancouver, Canada
6. Düsseldorf, Germany
7. Frankfurt, Germany
8. Geneva, Switzerland
9. Copenhagen, Denmark
10. Bern, Switzerland
10. (tie) Sydney, Australia
12. Amsterdam, Netherlands
13. Wellington, New Zealand
14. Ottawa, Canada
15. Toronto, Canada
16. Berlin, Germany
17. Hamburg, Germany
17. Melbourne, Australia
19. Luxembourg, Luxembourg
21. Perth, Australia
22. Brussels, Belgium
23. Montreal, Canada
24. Nuremberg, Germany
25. Singapore, Singapore
26. Canberra, Australia
27. Stuttgart, Germany
28. Honolulu, U.S.
29. Adelaide, Australia
29. (tie) Paris, France
29. (tie) San Francisco, U.S.
Mercer's survey results are based on an analysis of local living conditions comprising 39 factors in 10 categories. Political considerations include government stability and crime rates. Economic factors take into account banking services and currency exchange laws. Health considerations include access to medical care and pollution levels. Transport, housing and recreation are also taken into account.
City scores help multinational companies calculate compensation packages for the employees they dispatch overseas. A lower score often correlates into a better compensation package that includes hardship allowances, according to Mercer.
Countries with unstable governments or undergoing civil strife tend usually have lower scores. Eight African cities dominate the bottom ten in this year's survey.
"The ongoing turmoil in many countries across North Africa and the Middle East has led to serous security issues for locals and expatriates," says Mercer's Parakatil. "Companies need to be able to proactively implement mitigation plans, such as emergency repatriation, or adjust expatriate compensation packages accordingly."
Around the word and on a regional basis, the cities that score the lowest are the following:
64. Belfast, Northern Ireland (Western Europe)
71. Detroit, Michigan, (United States)
207. Dushanbe, Tajikistan (Asia-Pacific)
213. Tbilisi, Georgia (Eastern Europe)
219. Port-au-Prince, Haiti (North Americas)
This year's city with the worst quality of life?
Baghdad, Iraq at #221.

Envoy: 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in Syria
From Amir Ahmed, CNN updated 10:04 AM EST, Mon December 31, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: At least 143 people were killed Sunday, a Syrian opposition group says
Syria says its military killed terrorists who were attacking orchards
Saturday may have been the deadliest day of the conflict
There could be 100,000 deaths in Syria next year, envoy says
(CNN) -- The stench of the burnt bodies was so potent, Abu Jafar said, he could smell it from 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away.
"It smells awful because the regime appears to have burnt so many bodies recently," the opposition activist said Sunday from the beleaguered city of Homs.
"Some cars arrived this morning and carried away dead bodies. We are not sure where."

Jafar's account comes a day after what may be the deadliest day yet in Syria's 21-month civil war, according to opposition figures.
Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy, gave a dire warning Sunday on the rapidly deteriorating situation in Syria.
"If nearly 50,000 people have been killed in about two years, do not expect just 25,000 people to die next year -- maybe 100,000 will die," he told reporters in Cairo.
"The pace is increasing," he said.
"A solution is still possible, but it is only getting more complicated every day," Brahimi added. "Had we dealt more carefully with this conflict in 2011, it would have been much easier to resolve it. There is no question that it is much harder today."

Brahimi met Sunday with Nabil Elaraby, secretary-general of the Arab League.
On Saturday, Brahimi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Russia and China have used their veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block some of the toughest resolutions proposed against the Syrian regime.

Syrian rebels: Defection will spark more
Traveling heavily in hopes of brokering a halt to the war, Brahimi said last week he is pinning his hopes on the formation of a transitional government in Damascus that would hold power until an election.
Opposition: Syrians killed in attack
At least 397 people were killed across the country Saturday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. At least 143 deaths were reported Sunday, including 10 children.
Intense violence kills dozens in Syria
The LCC said Saturday's death toll included more than 200 people who were captured and "field executed" by Syrian soldiers in the Homs suburb of Deir Baalbeh after Syrian forces won a battle there.
Read more: As Syria suffering spirals, envoy hopes for political transition
The group's representative in Deir Baalbeh said he could only personally account for 27 deaths, but said a Syrian soldier who had been captured by rebels said government forces killed at least 200 people in the suburb.
The group posted video of several men's bodies lined up in a grassy field with wounds to the head, in what it claimed was footage taken by witnesses.
Jafar said he believes Deir Baalbeh was targeted "because it is the main gate to reach the Khaldiya neighborhood, which has been under the control of the rebels."
Syrian state-run TV confirmed there was conflict in the area but said that government forces had been chasing down "terrorists." News footage showed bodies that appeared to have been dragged across the floor in a building, leaving long trails of blood behind.

The news report said forces had killed "several terrorists" in the Deir Baalbeh area. The government frequently refers to rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad as "terrorists."
But another opposition activist in Homs, Hadi Abdallah, said the situation in nearby Deir Baalbeh "is only turning from bad to worse."
"Smoke is rising from Deir Baalbeh this morning, and a stench is coming out of some of its streets due to the burning of some corpses by the regime forces," Abdallah said Sunday.
"What is noticeable in the bodies we found yesterday and today in Deir Baalbeh is that they appear to have been slaughtered at the neck and then burned, including women and children. Others appear to have been killed from knife and bullet wounds."

Syria's state-run news agency SANA said Sunday that the military has been killing many terrorists.
One army unit "killed several terrorists and injured many others" and destroyed launchers of locally made missiles that the terrorists had used to attack orchards in the Maartamasrin area in Idlib province, SANA reported.
CNN cannot independently confirm casualty and other reports as Syria's government has severely restricted access to the country.

From Tina Burnside, CNN

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Arizona gun store says it has refunded the money Kelly is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords Giffords was shot in the head in Tuscon two years ago (CNN) -- An Arizona gun store says it has canceled a recent purchase of an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle by Mark Kelly thwarting the retired astronaut's attempt to demonstrate how easy it is to buy high-powered weapons.
Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords and an outspoken advocate for new gun control measures, had in recent interviews said he was buying the rifle to showcase what he said are unobtrusive background checks.
Kelly: Gun loophole makes no sense
Doug MacKinlay, owner of Diamondback Police Supply, said it was Kelly's statements that caused him to stop the sale.
"I determined that it was in my company's best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store to complete the Federal Form 4473 and NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) required of Mr. Kelly before he could take possession of this firearm," MacKinlay posted on the Tuscon store's Facebook page Monday.
Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control
MacKinlay said he sent a full refund to Kelly and nixed the transaction because Kelly made statements in the media that the rifle purchase was "for reasons other then (sic) for his personal use."
Kelly could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.
The AR-15 is one of America's top-selling firearms, and has become a focus of the gun control debate after being used in a recent spate of mass shootings. One was used in the December massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. Advocates for tighter gun laws argue there's no need for Americans to own the powerful rifle, but the gun's proponents say the AR-15's accuracy makes it safe.
Kelly said on CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer," that it was "important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that."
Intern's memoir recalls Giffords shooting
Later on in the March 11 interview Kelly said "It is actually pretty easy. You know, for a weapon that's so deadly and really designed for the military, especially with the high-capacity magazines, it is a pretty easy thing to do, even with a background check."
Kelly has become a fierce gun control advocate after Giffords, his wife, was wounded in a 2011 Arizona shooting. Giffords was shot in the head in the Tucson shooting rampage that left six dead.

IRS scandal is about donors, not tax By Roger Colinvaux, Special to CNN
updated 3:22 PM EDT, Fri May 17, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Roger Colinvaux: The outrage over the IRS's conduct is based on a misunderstanding
Colinvaux: The issue is fundamentally about disclosure of donors, not tax-exempt status He says that after ruling, political groups can use the tax law to hide identity of donors
Colinvaux: The IRS should not be put in the position of deciding whether a group is political
Editor's note: Roger Colinvaux is associate professor of law at Catholic University of America. He was counsel to the U.S. Joint Committee on Taxation from 2001 to 2008 on tax-exempt organization issues and recently testified before the House and Senate on tax reform and 501(c)(3) organizations. (CNN) -- The outrage over the IRS's conduct in targeting certain tax-exempt groups is based on a misunderstanding. Obviously, mistakes were made in how the IRS examined the groups, but what should not get lost amid the resulting hue and cry is that this is fundamentally about disclosure of donors, not tax-exempt status.
First of all, the IRS is to a certain extent in the "targeting" business. The agency's job -- like it or not -- is as an enforcer. It is supposed to go after tax scofflaws. It has to look for clues in tax returns and other materials to find the cheaters and dodgers.
In the current scandal, the method of the "targeting" -- searching returns for names like "tea party" as indicators of possible misfeasance -- was a mistake. But it does not follow that the IRS should not have been looking at these and other groups as a class, without regard to political affiliation.
Roger Colinvaux
Second is the question of what the IRS is looking for. Because the IRS is the cop guarding tax-exempt status, we think that the IRS is supposed to be deciding whether a group should be granted the "privilege" of tax exemption. It follows that we would and should be outraged if the IRS grants or denies the "privilege" because of an organization's political beliefs.
But this is wrong. This is not really what the IRS is doing when enforcing the tax laws in this context. To be clear: Tax exemption here is not much of a privilege and is not the main issue.
IRS commissioner: I did not mislead
Penn Jillette on IRS: Breaks my heart
Tax-exempt status is offered by many parts of the tax code and not primarily to bestow some special tax break on an organization because of its function. Here's a breakdown:
501(c)(3) charity
Process for Exemption: Must apply to IRS. Scrutiny required because of other tax benefits charities receive.
Reason for Exemption: Performs a public benefit, lessens burdens of government.
501(c)(4) social welfare, 501(c)(5) labor union, 501(c)(6)
Process for Exemption: Not required to apply to IRS but can self-declare exempt status.
Reason for Exemption: Administrative convenience. Not much taxable income. Generally for a nonprofit purpose.
527 political organization Process for Exemption: Must notify IRS (but approval not required).
Reason for Exemption: Historically always exempt on contributions -- seen as a pass-thru entity.
The exception is for charitable organizations, i.e., 501(c)(3)s, which do have heightened standards for tax exemption. But the extra scrutiny here is less because of tax exemption and more because of other tax benefits that flow from tax-exempt status, such as the ability to receive tax-deductible contributions. Importantly, charitable organizations are not allowed to engage in any political activity, because Congress long ago decided that charity and politics are incompatible.
For noncharitable groups like the tea party groups, organized on a not-for-profit basis, tax exemption flows almost as a matter of course. Tax exemption is not viewed primarily as a subsidy of the federal government but more as a matter of administrative convenience.
Many nonprofit groups do not have much income, would not owe much tax, and so tax exemption is not that much of a "benefit." This is why such groups are not even required to apply for tax-exempt status but rather can just hold themselves out as tax exempt and simply start filing annual returns as an exempt group.
If this is true, however, then why does the IRS care about any group applying for exemption as other than a charity?
Well, the question for the IRS here is not really one of whether a group is tax exempt but under which part of the code the exemption will come from. Will a group be "tax exempt" under one part of the tax code, e.g., as a section 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organization, or under another part, e.g., as a section 527 political organization?
Both sections offer a form of tax exemption. But the big difference between the two has nothing to do with taxes. Rather, it has to do with the disclosure of donors.
For reasons of campaign finance law (not tax law), public disclosure of donors is required for political organizations but not for social welfare organizations. And this brings us to the current scandal.
After the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, it became possible for a 501(c)(4) organization to engage in unlimited amounts of political spending. It thus also became possible for a political organization to use the tax law to hide the identity of donors. After Citizens United, the abuse the IRS is tasked with policing is whether an organization that claims to be a "social welfare" organization is in reality a political organization in disguise.
So the IRS, when faced with a deluge of new applications for 501(c)(4) status, rightly had to decide whether some or many of these groups were actually political organizations, tax-exempt under section 527, and so subject to disclosure rules.
Primarily for reasons of campaign finance law, the IRS has been put in the position of deciding whether a group is primarily political. This is not a job the IRS is good at or ever will be good at. And as we have seen, it is not a job that we want the IRS to have.
The solution is disclosure. Congress has the power to level the playing field on disclosure and should take action to do so. This will allow legitimate nonpolitical social welfare organizations to enjoy their appropriate tax status and return section 501(c)(4) to the backwater of exempt law it once was.

Catching up with Christie scandal
By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN
updated 2:48 PM EST, Mon January 20, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mayor said she was told pressure on development project came from Christie
Lieutenant Governor will deny mayor's assertions Monday, source says
Christie was in Florida raising funds and meeting donors this weekend
(CNN) -- More trouble was brewing back home this weekend for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie while he was in Florida raising money for Republican candidates.
Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken, said Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno approached her in a parking lot last May and said her community would not receive Superstorm Sandy relief funds unless she backed a redevelopment program proposed by a group with ties to Christie.
"She said that to me ... this is a direct message from the governor," Zimmer told Candy Crowley on Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."
Guadagno addressed Zimmer's version of the conversation on Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday service project, calling them "not only false, but illogical."
Zimmer's allegation added a new twist to claims of political payback and bullying by the Christie administration, which is embroiled in a scandal that suggests top aides orchestrated traffic jams around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last year to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing the governor for reelection.
Christie, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, denies any knowledge of such a scheme and has fired or sought resignations from key appointees and political associates. A state legislative committee has issued subpoenas for documents and other materials related to the scandal.
Christie, himself, has not been subpoenaed, but his office has.
Here's what you need to know to keep up:
Hoboken mayor: 'It's true' Christie administration withheld Sandy funds
She said/she said: Zimmer, who was elected to city hall after her predecessor was indicted on corruption charges in 2009, first made her allegations to MSNBC on Saturday. She went further on Sunday.
Mayor: Christie held Sandy funds hostage
Battle to save the brands
MSNBC vs. Gov. Chris Christie
"Now the fact is that she came. (The) lieutenant governor pulled me aside and said essentially, you got to move forward with the Rockefeller project. This project is really important to the governor. And she said that she had been with him Friday night and that this was a direct message from the Governor."
But Guadagno recalled events differently than Zimmer, telling a crowd in Union Beach: "Mayor Zimmer's version of our conversation in May of 2013 is not only false but is illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are examined. Any suggestion that Sandy funds were tied to the approval of any project in New Jersey is completely false."
Guadagno: Hoboken mayor's allegations are 'offensive to me'
Guadagno's statement Monday was the firstto address the most recent allegations she said at a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event in Union Beach, New Jersey.
A source close to Guadagno told CNN's Chris Frates Sunday night: "Kim remembers in their conversation that she was talking about redevelopment and making investments in Hoboken. She remembers Zimmer pressing Kim for money for Sandy. Kim remembers saying you can't tie the two together," the source said. "And she remembers Zimmer continuing to press and showing her a map of the city and pressing for aid for Sandy."
Is Christie talking?: He's not, but his spokesman, Collin Reed, said Sunday, "It's very clear partisan politics are at play here as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television."
Zimmer's talking to more than TV: After telling her story on CNN, Zimmer had another interview -- this one with federal investigators. In a statement Sunday, Zimmer said she met with U.S. attorney's investigator "for several hours at their request." And that she provided her journal and other documents.
"As they pursue this investigation, I will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project," Zimmer said in the statement.
Shortly after Guadagno spoke, Zimmer released a statement saying, "I met with the U.S. Attorney for over two hours yesterday, answered all their questions and turned over my journal in which I described my conversation with the Lieutenant Governor and Commissioner Constable. I stand by my word, remain willing to testify under oath, and I will continue to answer any questions asked of me by the U.S. Attorney's office."
Where was Christie?: He was raising money in Florida for incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott's re-election campaign and meeting with big Republican donors.
CNN political contributor Ana Navarro tweeted from the donors meeting that when asked about 2016, Christie replied, "Come see me next year."

'SNL' spoofs Christie controversy
Journal entries on Gov. Christie released About the scandals in New Jersey, Navarro tweeted Christie said, "I haven't enjoyed the last 11 days; no sane person would. Life presents challenges. u have to deal w/them."
Navarro said Christie looked very different between Satuday's events and Sunday's, saying the governor looked rested and more upbeat on Sunday.
Christie skips town for Florida donors
Christie connections: The Wolff and Samson law firm represents The Rockefeller Group, the real estate group trying to do the development in Hoboken. Port Authority Chairman David Samson, a Christie appointee, is a founding member of the firm.
Lori Grifa of Wolff & Samson is the former community affairs commissioner for New Jersey. Zimmer showed MSNBC an email from Grifa lobbying on behalf of the project and asking to speak with her.
Coming to Christie's defense: Seaside Height Mayor Bill Akers, a Republican who has publicly endorsed Christie, said he found what Zimmer had to say "surprising" and that "it just doesn't fit" with the Governor that he knows.
Akers said after Sandy, he worked with many Mayors along the shore, both Republicans and Democrats, and hasn't heard anyone talk about undue pressure from the Governor's office.
"I think he's been even-handed, he genuinely cares," Akers said. "What you see is what you get with the Governor."
Did Hoboken receive any Sandy money?: Christie's office said it did. Reed, Christie's spokesman, told CNN that Zimmer asked for $100 million from a roughly $300 million pot of money for which there was $14 billion worth of requests.
Since that request, Reed said, Hoboken has been approved for nearly $70 million in aid. The city has also been identified as a pilot community for a federal program to prevent flooding, one of only four such projects in New Jersey.
But Zimmer had a different take: "I think we really got shortchanged on the funding."
She said the $70 million given to Hoboken was mostly from flood insurance that did not need approval from the state. She received only $300,000 in Christie-approved funds, she said.
What does this have to do with a bridge?: It doesn't -- that's a separate scandal, one of the three in which Christie is currently snarled.
The bridge scandal concerns lane closures in Fort Lee near the congested George Washington Bridge. Members of Christie's staff have been implicated in closing the lanes for political payback.
Two members of the Port Authority have lost their jobs over it and so have two close Christie aides.
The state and federal government are also investigating, but there hasn't been any evidence that Christie was directly involved.
Then there's those tourism ads in which Christie and his family appear. The company that won the contract to produce the ads -- and included a role for Christie -- bid almost twice as much as the low bidder, which didn't include Christie.
Will scandals impact 2016 for Christie and Clinton?
Christie's troubles are no laughing matter: Except on "Saturday Night Live."

CNN - Russia releases American held for spying - December 6, 1997

Russia releases American held for spying
But espionage charges aren't dropped
December 6, 1997
Web posted at: 10:28 p.m. EST (0328 GMT)
ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia (CNN) -- A U.S. telecommunications engineer accused by Russia of spying was released from custody without bail Saturday, but Russians officials have refused to drop espionage charges lodged against him.
Richard Bliss, 29, was detained November 25 in the Black Sea city of Rostov-on-Don. Russia formally charged Bliss Friday with espionage -- the first such case against an American since the end of the Cold War. His release followed protests from the United States -- and warnings that his continued detention could damage economic relations between the two countries.
"This is a very positive move, and we are very pleased by it," said White House spokesman Eric Rubin. "As we've said all along, we saw no grounds for prosecution."
James Rubin, a spokesman for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said she "welcomes" the decision to release Bliss. However, he said Bliss would be required to stay in Russia while the investigation continues.
Bliss was installing cellular system
Bliss is an employee of San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc., and the company said he was in Russia making land surveys needed for installation of a cellular phone system. Qualcomm has a contract with a Russian firm, Elektrosvyaz, to set up a cellular system in Rostov-on-Don, a major city near the Black Sea. Though Russian authorities had originally indicated that Bliss's bail would be set at $5 million -- which Qualcomm had said it would be willing to pay -- he was released without bail. Qualcomm assured Russian officials in a written statement that Bliss would remain in Russia until the matter was resolved.
Russian intelligence agents accused Bliss of surveying unspecified "sensitive" sites using hand-held satellite receivers brought into Russia illegally. Bliss and Qualcomm have insisted that his activities were simply part of his job and did not involve espionage.
Officials of the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, said Bliss failed to list the device he was using to conduct surveys, known as a global positioning system, on his customs declaration when he entered Russia.
A statement from the FSB said Bliss admitted that he had not declared the device but denied that he was involved in espionage.
"These explanations (from Bliss) were contradicted by other materials which the investigative officers have," the statement said.
Qualcomm officials have assured the U.S. government that they had the appropriate licenses for the equipment Bliss was using.
U.S. warns case could damage relations
U.S. officials warned Russia on Friday that continued pursuit of the case could damage Russian-American relations at a time when the Russians need more U.S. economic aid.
Dialogue was conducted at the highest levels, with U.S. Vice President Al Gore calling Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin Friday to press for Bliss' release.
"Interfering with those pursuing legitimate commercial activities, who are employed by enterprises doing legitimate business in Russia, sends a very bad signal and could put a chilling effect on commercial relations that are important to future economic prosperity in Russia," said White House spokesman Mike McCurry. U.S. officials told CNN they feared that if Russia is perceived as mistreating U.S. workers, it would have a chilling effect on investments in Russia by American businesses.
Also, members of Congress, already angry about Russian arms deals with Iran, could pull the plug on additional economic aid, including pledges to pay for dismantling Russia's leftover nuclear weapons. Correspondents Ralph Begleiter and Jill Dougherty and Reuters contributed to this report.
