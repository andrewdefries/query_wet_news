First lady to honor health clinic funded by federal stimulusStory Highlights Caroline Family Practice is one of 126 proposed clinics to receive stimulus funds Clinic to provide low-income Virginians with inexpensive health care First lady Michelle Obama is visiting the clinic Monday Next Article in Politics » From Rachel Streitfeld CNN WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On a sunny day in March, about 25 contractors clustered in a dusty former grocery store in Bowling Green, Virginia. Construction was slow, and they hoped this new project -- a health care center funded by stimulus dollars -- could help steer their struggling businesses back toward stability. First lady Michelle Obama will spotlight the success of a stimulus-funded health clinic in Virginia. Four months later, and three weeks behind schedule because of electrical problems, first lady Michelle Obama on Monday will help cut the ribbon on the health center and declare the project a stimulus success story. The Caroline Family Practice was one of 126 proposed clinics to receive stimulus funds from Washington to both create jobs and emphasize preventive care. The clinic will provide low-income Virginians with inexpensive medical, dental and mental health care. When CNN visited the site in March, Rod Manifold, who heads the umbrella nonprofit Central Virginia Health Services, said the clinic would serve 3,000 to 4,000 people and create as many as 30 long-term jobs. It should also relieve crowding at a burdened health center nearby. Manifold received a $1.3 million stimulus check from the Department of Health and Human Services in March and had 120 days to turn a vacant supermarket into an operating clinic. And he said his government contacts were understanding about the short construction delay. Don't Miss Stimulus goes to summer jobs; critics raise questions
Commentary: Stimulus is too low, too slow
"They don't slap you around too much. They push you hard, and they want you to do it," he said. "That is always a challenge to us to try to get it done and operational." The construction job went to a Richmond, Virginia-based contractor with employees who live in the area. Soon, similar construction should be under way across the country. While visiting another health clinic last month, Obama announced another $851 million in stimulus funds to build or renovate 1,500 health centers nationwide. One challenge Manifold sees in the future: continuing to fund the clinic. When the stimulus money stops flowing two years from now, the health clinics will need to find alternate sources of funding to remain in operation.

Never too late to be a doctor By Madison Park, CNN Mike Moore, seen here in Tikrit with children from Iraq, decided in his mid-40s to go to medical school. STORY HIGHLIGHTSTraining to becoming a doctor takes seven to 11 years of school and residency9% of medical school applicants are over age 29Some older adults decide to become a doctor later in life (CNN) -- By the time Mike Moore finishes school and starts his career as a doctor, he'll be in his 50s. As a second-year medical student at Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences, Moore listens to lectures from younger professors and sits with classmates who are old enough to be his kids. "I kinda stick out a little bit," the 48-year-old Army major said. Stories about midlife career transitions are mostly about how a stressed out professional quits to pursue a passion like baking cupcakes or opening a cafe. Seldom do they involve a more rigorous route -- like becoming a doctor in your 40s and 50s. Medicine is a pressure-packed field that requires between seven and 11 years of training, including post-medical school residencies with 80-hour workweeks. Future doctors like Moore who make unlikely career choices are called nontraditional students, and they are increasingly attractive candidates for medical schools. "Some of them have become the most desirable applicants," said David Muller, dean for medical education at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Last year, 9% of the medical school applicants were over age 29, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Those statistics have held steady in the last five years. While 29 isn't exactly midlife, it means by the time students are done with their training, they'll be inching toward their 40s. Nontraditional applicants are on a mission, said Dr. Suzanne Miller, a medical school admissions consultant. "They've left lucrative jobs," she said. "Most people who come to me are in tears." They think they're insane for even thinking about investing the next 10 years to become a doctor, she said. But Miller encourages them. Medical schools are accepting nontraditional students because "emotional intelligence is just as or more important than IQ," she said. Wanted: Fewer science nerds, more 'culturally competent' doctors Nontraditional students are more likely to have real life experiences like balancing their checkbook, taking care of sick people or dealing with death. They might be better able to relate with patients, because they've already worked outside the academic setting, said Miller, author of "The Medical School Admissions Guide: A Harvard MD's Week by Week Admissions Handbook." Moore, who attends school in Yakima, Washington, put a lot at stake to go to medical school. His family depends on his wife as the sole breadwinner until he finishes school. They have two children. It meant, "I'm going to give up everything and become a physician," Moore said. His wife, a pediatrician, supported his decision. Moore studied for his medical admissions test in Iraq between missions. He flew to Qatar to take the exam and slept the night before in a cot at a U.S. military hospital. Having already worked as a military physician assistant, he decided to pursue a D.O. -- doctor of osteopathic medicine. "I know I love this," Moore said. "I can't see myself doing anything else." The appeal of older medical students is that they generally seem accomplished, mature, grounded and disciplined, said Muller, a medical school educator. "They didn't churn out of high school and college," he said. "They had time to think about it, process it and arrived at the position to be physicians or scientists." Heidi Meyer left her Broadway career to go to medical school and is completing her residency training. Heidi Meyer had always wanted to pursue medicine, but pursued musical theater instead. So her decision to quit her role in Broadway's "Miss Saigon" for medical school drew puzzled stares. "I wasn't going to grow and be the person I wanted to be," Meyer said about her theater career. She decided it was time. RELATED TOPICS

"Life is weird that way," she said. "I would be 40 by the time I was done with training and going into debt. I was already in debt being an actor in New York. The thinking was: Leap and it will appear." Meyer, 40, is now finishing her family medicine residency at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Meyer lost her income when she became a full-time student for two years at a post-baccalaureate premedical program to fulfill medical school requirements and then four more years at medical school. To support herself and pay rent, she found part-time work at the California Adventures amusement park singing in an a cappella group. Dr. Jessica Freedman, a medical admissions consultant, said there are two aspects about midcareer medical students. "From the admissions standpoint, you're concerned when you meet nontraditional applicants, because they bring great experience, diversity and a fresh outlook, but some are going to be set in their ways and difficult to teach," she said. There are also questions whether it's wise to give competitive medical school spots to older students who may not be able to practice as many years as the younger ones. "I may only practice for 20 or maybe 30 years, but those are going to be high-quality years," Moore said. "I feel like I can contribute something very unique and special to health care that other people can't. I can also be a great example. You don't have to hang it up when you're 50. "I have a whole lifetime ahead of me."

Rebels seize control of Goma amid clashes in Democratic Republic of Congo
By David McKenzie, CNN
updated 8:37 PM EST, Tue November 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Britain sends an official to the region to discuss an end to the crisis
Reports say M23 is taking children and women, destroying property, and intimidating journalists
The U.N. alleges 'grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law'
Shells fired over the border kill two people in Rwanda, the foreign minister says
(CNN) -- Congolese rebels took control of the eastern city of Goma and part of the border with Rwanda on Tuesday after days of heavy clashes, a Congolese reporter there said.
The rebels took control of the government radio station in Goma and were seen walking through town, entering government and police buildings, said the reporter, who could not be named for security reasons.
The rebels are part of the M23 rebel group, which has been engaged in heavy fighting with Congolese army forces in the region since last Thursday.
Though 1,500 United Nations peacekeeping troops are in Goma and have control of the airport there, a U.N. spokesman said the situation is at a "critical stage."

"Reports indicate that the M23 has wounded civilians, is continuing abductions of children and women, is destroying property and is intimidating journalists and those who have attempted to resist their control," said Eduardo del Buey, the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general.
A total of 6,000 troops from the U.N. mission in Congo, MONUSCO, are in the wider region of North and South Kivu, patrolling areas of particular insecurity, del Buey said.
The United Nations, the African Union and countries in the region are demanding that M23 immediately stop its attacks, Buey said.
France and Britain expressed their concerns Tuesday. The British Foreign Office said its minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, was traveling to Rwanda, Congo, and Uganda to support efforts to end the crisis.
"I am deeply concerned by the current crisis and I urge the M23 to stop their offensive and for all external support to the M23 to cease," Simmonds said in a statement ahead of the visit.

The conflict spread over the border Tuesday when several shells hit Rwanda, killing two people and wounding several others, Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told CNN.
An M23 rebel spokesman, calling his group the Revolutionary Army of Congo, went on the radio Tuesday afternoon to address the people of Goma. Lt. Col. Vianey Kazarama said the group was there to protect the population and that people should return to work Wednesday.
Any remaining pockets of the army should join the rebels or the M23 will fight against them, Kazarama said. He called on members of the police and army still in Goma to meet with the rebel leadership Wednesday morning to hand over their weapons and uniforms and join the rebels' cause.
The group has already started recruiting new members at the police headquarters in Goma, according to the Congolese reporter on the scene.
Several high-ranking government officials have fled Goma for nearby Bukavu, in South Kivu, U.N. officials and a senior NGO official said earlier Tuesday.
The local Goma government could not be reached for comment. Nor could MONUSCO, which is mandated to protect civilians in Goma.
Read more: Fighting worsens 'deteriorating' situation in eastern Congo
The eastern part of Congo, which includes Goma, has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide.
Soldiers from the M23 group were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009. They broke away from the Congolese army in April, however, complaining of a lack of pay and poor conditions.
One of its commanders, Bosco Ntaganda, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, including recruiting child soldiers.
Security analysts say the rebellion in eastern Congo has dangerous regional implications, and the international community has expressed alarm at the M23 advances.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned M23's advance into Goma and said anyone responsible for rights abuses would be held to account.
"The M23 must withdraw their forces immediately and allow legitimate government control to be restored. The cessation of hostilities and the protection of civilians is paramount," he said in a statement.
The International Crisis Group, an independent anti-conflict non-profit group, warned that the fall of Goma could lead to serious human rights abuses against civilians. The settling of scores or even extrajudicial killing of members of the authorities and civil society activists who have opposed M23 could fuel further violence, it said.
The unrest could also spread to neighboring communities and "relaunch open warfare between the DRC and Rwanda," the group said on its website.
The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation, and Mushikiwabo said Tuesday Rwanda has moved "way past" the accusations.
Rwanda will not engage in any talks with M23, Mushikiwabo said. "Our interlocutor is the government of the DRC," she said.
Mushikiwabo said Rwanda would close the border crossing if asked to by the Congolese government, but that such a move could have humanitarian consequences.
Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.
CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

Police: Man kills 3, himself in Southern California shooting spree
By Jason Hanna, CNN
updated 11:29 PM EST, Tue February 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ali Syed killed three, wounded three during spree that involved carjackings in Orange County, police say
Authorities: Syed first killed woman at his parents' home, then shot at motorists
Suspect killed himself after police spotted him north of Tustin, police say
(CNN) -- In the middle of a shooting spree that killed three people and unleashed terror on Southern California motorists Tuesday morning, Ali Syed told one of his carjacking victims to walk away, police say.
"Mr. Syed ... said, 'I don't want to hurt you, I killed somebody. Today's my last day. Give me your keys,' " Tustin Police Chief Scott Jordan told reporters.
According to preliminary accounts from police, Syed, 20, didn't intentionally spare another target.
Police say they believe Syed, a part-time college student, fatally shot a woman at his family's Ladera Ranch home before killing two other people -- including a senior citizen executed outside his vehicle -- and wounding three others as he fired a shotgun at Orange County motorists on the Costa Mesa Freeway and committed three carjackings.
The spree ended when Syed died after he turned his gun on himself as police approached on a road north of Tustin, authorities say.
The Orange County Sheriff's Department says it was called to the Ladera Ranch home, where Syed lived with his parents, on a report of shots fired about 4:45 a.m. PT.
A woman in her 20s was found dead there. Police said she wasn't related to Syed, but they didn't release her name, and they said they didn't know why she was at the home.
Syed left the home in his parents' SUV, police said. About 25 minutes after that police call and 20 miles to the northwest, Syed drove into a Denny's and Big Lots parking lot in Tustin, exited the vehicle and shot a driver in the back of the head, Jordan said.
The wounded motorist -- a man who was waiting for his son to carpool with him to work -- managed to drive away before stopping near an overpass, Jordan said. The victim was being treated Tuesday, police said.
That's when Syed, whose SUV had a flat tire, approached the man he would spare. Syed ran toward the man at a nearby gas station, took his keys and drove the pickup truck away without firing at him, Jordan said.
Syed then drove south on the Costa Mesa Freeway, exited onto a transition road, got out of the vehicle and fired a shotgun at southbound vehicles on the freeway, hitting three vehicles, police said.
One of the freeway drivers was wounded in the hand and face, but investigators don't know whether the wounds were from shotgun rounds or debris, according to Jordan.
Police said Syed then drove to nearby Santa Ana, crashing the pickup into a curb on a freeway off-ramp. There, he pointed the shotgun at Melvin L. Edwards, 69, of Laguna Hills, who was in a BMW at a stop sign.
"Syed ... got (Edwards) out of the car at gunpoint, walked him across the road and executed him -- shot him three times," Jordan said.
Syed drove Edwards' BMW to the parking lot of a Tustin-area Micro Center computer store, where police said he found his next two shooting victims.
Syed shot and killed Jeremy Lewis, 26, of Fullerton, who was in a vehicle in the lot, police said. Lewis had worked at a construction site across the street.
People from the construction site then approached, and Syed shot and wounded one of them in the arm, Jordan said. Syed entered that person's vehicle and drove north on the Costa Mesa Freeway before exiting again.
By that time, authorities had received many phone calls about the shootings, and California Highway Patrol officers found Syed driving at an intersection about 5 miles north of Tustin, Jordan said.
Syed exited the vehicle as it slowly rolled near the intersection, according to police.
"There really wasn't a confrontation at that very end," Jordan said. "As soon as he got out of his vehicle, before it actually came to a complete stop, he shot and killed himself," Jordan said.
Syed was unemployed and taking one class at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, an Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman said.
Police said they're trying to determine what led to the shootings, and that they didn't yet know of a motive.

House rejects effort to curb NSA phone surveillance By Deirdre Walsh, CNN Senior Congressional Producer updated 8:53 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lawmakers were outraged by sweeping way in which phone surveillance applied
Proposal attached to defense funding measure was defeated 217-205
Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked records of the program in June
Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. House on Wednesday narrowly defeated a proposal to sharply restrict the National Security Agency's phone surveillance program that was exposed by Edward Snowden.
The Obama administration and House Speaker John Boehner, unlikely allies in the sharp partisan climate in Washington, joined forces to reject the limit offered as an amendment to a defense spending bill, 217-205.
A coalition of libertarian, liberal and conservative lawmakers pushed for curbs on the blanket collection of those records, arguing that it was too broad and intrusive.
Snowden, a former NSA contractor, revealed details of the bulk phone tracking effort and a companion e-mail collection initiative through leaks of classified information to media outlets last month. He has been charged with espionage.
Since then, a number of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been highly critical of the sweeping way in which the government applies telephone surveillance that is overseen by a secret court.
ACLU, gov't reps debate NSA programs
Alexander defends secrecy around NSA program
The NSA's secret court They and privacy groups concluded the government had reached too far into the personal lives of Americans in the interests of national security.
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said during debate on the amendment that the NSA had exceeded its mandate. He said the measure would have halted surveillance of people not under direct investigation by authorities.
"The time has come to stop it," he said.
But Rep. Tom Cotton said approval would have effectively killed the program, which he said has been found constitutional and approved by bipartisan majorities.
"Folks, we are at war," said Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and Iraq War veteran who urged his colleagues not to undermine the surveillance tool he said was critical for troops in the field in counterterrorism operations.
Unusual alliances
The proposal forged alliances among bitter political rivals on Capitol Hill. It even prompted an unusual tactical move by the White House to weigh in on an amendment vote before debate, saying the proposal was hasty and blunt and would dismantle a counterterrorism tool.
House Republican leaders tried several ways to stave off a vote, but agreed under pressure from many conservatives eager for public debate.
A breakdown of the tally showed 134 Republicans voting with 83 Democrats to reject the measure offered by the Michigan odd couple of sophomore Republican Rep. Justin Amash and 25-term Democratic Rep John Conyers.
Boehner, who as speaker rarely votes on the House floor, opposed it as did House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.
But 94 Republicans and 111 Democrats supported it.
Amash told reporters his amendment was "about the American people versus the elites in Washington."
He maintained that NSA program represented "a clear violation" of Fourth Amendment protections regarding warrants.
Amash said he was simply working to ensure the government was following the original intent of the Patriot Act, the anti-terror law that authorized increased government surveillance powers after 9/11.
Top Republicans argued against the measure, with chairs of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Appropriations committees circulating a letter saying it would have "unintended consequences for the intelligence and law enforcement communities."
National security pressure
National security officials personally appealed to House members, hoping to derail the vote. They have said phone and e-mail surveillance have helped thwart terror plots.
President Barack Obama also has stressed that the NSA was not using the surveillance program to listen in on phone calls; that it only collected metadata, including numbers, times of calls and dates.
James Clapper, the nation's top intelligence official, released a statement before the vote noting that he had joined others in opposing the measure.
New York Democratic Rep Jerry Nadler, a critic of the original provisions on data collection in the Patriot Act, said he wasn't persuaded by the warnings from the administration. He voted for the amendment.
"I never dreamed it would ever be used for dragnet surveillance of every American phone call, even if only for metadata. And frankly that's way beyond what Congress intended," he said.
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank often cited by Republicans, released an analysis that warned the amendment would "increase the risks of terrorist attacks by limiting the scope of court-ordered foreign intelligence collection and thereby depriving the U.S. of valuable intelligence it currently collects."
But at a monthly forum sponsored by Heritage that features some of the House's most conservative members, that argument didn't sway many members. Eight of the nine lawmakers on the Wednesday panel, which included Amash, said they planned to vote for it.
Rep Michele Bachmann, a leader of the tea party movement on Capitol Hill, broke with fellow conservative lawmakers, saying the NSA program collects phone records from telecommunications companies not individuals, so there is "no expectation of privacy."
A member of the House Intelligence Committee, Bachmann warned that "if we take this program and remove from the United States the distinct advantage we have versus any other country it would be those that would be seeking to achieve the goals of Islamic Jihad who will benefit from by putting the United States at risk."
The defense spending bill now moves to the Senate, but that chamber has not considered its version yet in committee or scheduled a floor vote. But in the Senate, there is little support for making major changes to the NSA program.
Before the vote Nadler said even this amendment failed he and other opponents of the program would continue to press for changes.
"It simply will not be renewed when it expires in 2015. It's going to end - now or later. The only question is when and on what terms."

SeaWorld responds to questions about captive orcas, 'Blackfish' film
updated 11:27 AM EDT, Mon October 28, 2013
A scene from one of SeaWorld's popular orca shows.
Watch an encore of "Blackfish" on CNN, Saturday, November 2 at 9 p.m. ET. (CNN) -- This week, CNN will present the premiere of "Blackfish," a documentary that traces the history of killer whales in captivity leading up to the 2010 killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by Tilikum, an orca previously associated with the death of two other people.
SeaWorld has been critical of the film, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, issuing this statement to CNN:
"Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for Dawn Brancheau's family, friends and colleagues. To promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts about SeaWorld -- among them, that SeaWorld is one of the world's most respected zoological institutions, that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research. Perhaps most important, the film fails to mention SeaWorld's commitment to the safety of its team members and guests and to the care and welfare of its animals, as demonstrated by the company's continual refinement and improvement to its killer whale facilities, equipment and procedures both before and after the death of Dawn Brancheau."
SeaWorld declined CNN's requests to be interviewed on camera. However, Vice President of Communications Fred Jacobs agreed to answer some questions about the controversy over the film and about keeping orcas in captivity.
History of killer whale capture
The truth behind orcas in captivity
Here are Jacobs' unedited responses to CNN's questions:
CNN: In your statement, SeaWorld notes that Blackfish "withholds from viewers key facts about SeaWorld," including that SeaWorld has rescued, rehabilitated, and returned to the wild hundreds of wild animals: Do any of those animals include orcas?
SeaWorld: Yes, though killer whales do not beach with the same frequency as other species and when they do it is typically a last ditch effort at survival. Killer whales, like all stranded marine mammals, are generally gravely ill, injured, malnourished, dehydrated, very old or very young, and do not survive long on shore. Nonetheless, we've assisted whales many times, including killer whales. The largest whale to ever be rescued, rehabilitated and returned to the wild -- J.J. the orphaned gray whale calf -- was part of our rescue program. (See the attached paper from a biologist at the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute (PDF).) You can read about our role in rescuing killer whales from Barnes Lake in Alaska here and our role in rescuing a killer whale named Springer here. We also assisted our colleagues at Dolfinarium in Holland with veterinary care and husbandry for an orphaned and hearing-impaired juvenile killer whale they rescued. SeaWorld was part of the team to help Luna, as well as a young killer whale stranded near Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. We also are regularly called upon to do pathology on beached whales that do not survive.
CNN: What kind of rehabilitation and rescue efforts does SeaWorld provide for orcas?
SeaWorld: See the answer above. I should stress that the goal of our rescue program is the rehabilitation of an animal in need so that it can be successfully reintroduced to the wild. That occurs hundreds of times each year. Just this week we released a beached common dolphin that was rescued and rehabilitated by our park in San Diego. There are few organizations in the world that rescue more animals than we do: more than 23,000 since the program's inception.
CNN: What are the benefits to keeping orcas in captivity?
SeaWorld: The primary benefits are identical for any species in any accredited zoological institution: education and science. At SeaWorld more than 11 million people each year (hundreds of millions since our first park opened its gates in 1964) have experienced killer whales in a way that is personal, enriching and inspirational. Learn more here. It is our hope that every person who has visited SeaWorld leaves with a greater understanding of and appreciation for all the animals we display, including killer whales. I have attached two documents that outline some of our peer-reviewed contributions to the scientific understanding of killer whales. Note that this is just killer whales. We have similar bibliographies for many of the species living at SeaWorld.
CNN: Many marine biologists and animal ethicists believe that orcas should not be kept in captivity because they are designed to travel hundreds of miles each day. Do you think the exposure that SeaWorld provides to millions of people who might not otherwise see a killer whale outweighs these concerns about impact of captivity on orcas?
SeaWorld: While a killer whale can and occasionally might travel as much as 100 miles in a day, it should be said that swimming that distance is not integral to a whale's health and well-being. It is likely foraging behavior. Given the challenge of finding and killing as much as 300 pounds of prey every day, killer whales in the wild -- like any species -- conserve energy and move only as much as necessary. Killer whales living in our parks are given all the food they require. They also exercise, receive veterinary care, live in the company of other members of their species, and receive mental stimulation. They adapt very well to life in a zoological setting. I should also note that the overwhelming majority of killer whales in our parks were born in the care of man.
CNN: What specifically have we learned about captive orcas that has benefited marine biology and applies to orcas in the wild?
SeaWorld: Please see the attached bibliographies (Here and here - PDFs). Much of what is known about the killer whale's anatomy, reproductive biology and capacity to learn was learned at SeaWorld and other accredited zoological institutions.
CNN: SeaWorld trainer and Vice President Michael Scarpuzzi notes the "millions of safe interactions we have had with killer whales" in the past 50 years. Does SeaWorld intend to put trainers back into the water with its killer whales?
SeaWorld: Trainers enter the water only as part of in-water safety desensitization training. You can learn more about that process here. Our trainers have not entered the water for performances since February 2010 and we have no plans for them to return to that kind of interaction with our whales.
CNN: How's Tilikum doing today? Is he participating in any of SeaWorld's shows?
SeaWorld: He is doing well for a killer whale that is more than 30 years old. He interacts with other whales and our zoological staff and he makes regular public appearances.
CNN: What are SeaWorld's thoughts on sea pens as an alternative solution where humans can not only study and research killer whales, but enjoy them as well?
SeaWorld: Sea pens can be effective for transitioning a rescued animal back to life in the open ocean, but they are not appropriate for long-term care. Our killer whale habitats are the largest and most sophisticated ever constructed for a marine mammal: 7 million gallons of continually filtered and chilled water. They provide an environment that allows us to properly care for, display and study the animals.
CNN: How is SeaWorld's current park attendance compared to last year? Whether you've seen an incline or a decline, what do you attribute that to?
SeaWorld: Our attendance is good. In fact, we are on pace for a record year in 2013. Learn more here.

Ex-NFL star Sharper charged with rape in Calif.; 3 other states eyeing him By Michael Martinez, CNN
updated 7:22 PM EST, Thu February 20, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Sharper is also under probe in 5 alleged rapes in 3 other states, LA police say
NEW: In those states, cops investigate allegations of women's drinks being drugged
NEW: Sharper's attorney: "We are very hopeful ... that Mr. Sharper will be fully exonerated"
Darren Sharper appears in court, but his arraignment is postponed until next week
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former NFL star Darren Sharper was charged in California on Friday in the alleged drugging and rape of two women, one in October and the other last month, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said.
The five-time Pro Bowl player who became an NFL Network analyst is charged with two counts of rape by use of drugs, four counts of furnishing a controlled substance and one count of possession of a controlled substance, all felonies, the prosecutor's office said.
Sharper, 38, who played defensive back for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints during his 14-year career, appeared Friday in a Los Angeles County court, but his arraignment was postponed until Thursday, said spokesman Ricardo Santiago of the district attorney's office.
Sharper was arrested January 17 and released on $200,000 bail, but prosecutors will seek next Thursday to raise his bail to $10 million, Santiago said.

The alleged controlled substances were morphine and zolpidem, another name for the prescription sleep aid Ambien.
On October 30, Sharper met two women at a West Hollywood nightclub -- Bootsy Bellows on the Sunset Strip -- and invited them to a party, authorities allege.
Sharper, who lives in Miami Beach, Florida, allegedly told them he had to stop by his Los Angeles hotel room to pick up something, and he invited them to the room. While there, he allegedly gave each woman a drink in the form of shot, and the women then passed out, prosecutors said.
The first woman woke up naked hours later as Sharper allegedly was sexually assaulting her, prosecutors said. The other woman awakened and "interrupted his actions," according to court papers cited by prosecutors.
The two women gathered their belongings and left the hotel, authorities said.
On January 14, Sharper met two women at the same West Hollywood nightclub and also invited them to a party, prosecutors said.
A similar series of events allegedly unfolded: Sharper made a stop by his hotel room, invited the women in and allegedly offer them a shot, which caused them to pass out, prosecutors said.
When they woke up hours later on January 15, one woman believed she was sexually assaulted, and both women left the hotel and sought medical treatment, prosecutors said.
If convicted of the Los Angeles County charges, Sharper would face more than 30 years in state prison, prosecutors said.
A Los Angeles attorney representing Sharper told CNN on Friday that she was looking forward to "the true facts in this matter being revealed.
"And we are very hopeful that at the end of day that Mr. Sharper will be fully exonerated," added attorney Blair Berk.
Los Angeles County prosecutors allege in court papers that Sharper also is suspected of rape in Tempe, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and New Orleans, Louisiana.
"I believe that the defendant is involved in seven acts of rape and eleven acts of furnishing a controlled substance" in those three communities and the Los Angeles area between last September and January, Los Angeles police investigator John Macchiarella stated in papers requesting an increase in Sharper's bail to $10 million.
In Nevada, Sharper is a suspect in an ongoing rape investigation, Las Vegas police Officer Jose Hernandez told CNN.
"We do have an active and ongoing investigation and at the conclusion of this investigation, it will be submitted to the DA's office for consideration of charges," Hernandez said. He didn't elaborate.
Macchiarella said in court papers that Sharper allegedly invited to his Las Vegas hotel room two women and a man he met in a Las Vegas nightclub. The three guests "blacked out" after Sharper allegedly served them shots, Macchiarella wrote.
One woman claimed she found injuries to her face when she woke up and alleged Sharper served her another unknown beverage and "the next thing she remembered was defendant Sharper sexually assaulting her," Macchiarella stated in court papers.
The other woman awoke and believed she had been sexually assaulted, wrote Macchiarella, who reviewed the Nevada police reports.
The man awoke sitting alone at the bar inside of the hotel, without any memory of how he arrived there, Macchiarella said in the papers.
New Orleans police are also investigating Sharper after a 25-year-old woman accused him of sexual assault in September, New Orleans police spokeswoman Cherie Guggenheim confirmed to CNN.
The woman told police she consumed a large amount of alcohol last September 23 and met Sharper at one of the bars she visited, a police report said.
Sharper allegedly took the victim to his apartment and raped her, according to the police report and to Guggenheim. The woman told police she didn't consent to any sexual encounter. Sharper hasn't been charged and the investigation is ongoing, according to the report and to Guggenheim.
In Arizona, Sharper accompanied two women to a nightclub in Scottsdale and then joined them at the apartment of one of the women, according to the police report from the incident.
While in the apartment, Sharper allegedly served one woman a shot and she then blacked out, wrote Macchiarella, who reviewed police reports from Arizona.
During the time Sharper and the women were in the apartment, a female roommate who shared the apartment joined the group. Sharper also allegedly served the roommate a drink in the form of a shot, and as the roommate became disoriented and went to the bathroom, she allegedly saw Sharper on top of one of the other women with his buttocks exposed, Macchiarella said.
The two women who had accompanied Sharper to the apartment later underwent sexual assault exams, Macchiarella wrote. A crime lab test later found zolpidem in the cup that Sharper allegedly used as he served shots, Macchiarella said.
After Sharper was arrested in Los Angeles last month, the NFL Network suspended him without pay, a spokesman said.
Sharper's pro football career began as a second-round draft choice by the Green Bay Packers in 1997. After eight seasons with the Packers, including a loss to Denver in Super Bowl XXXII, he moved to the Minnesota Vikings for four years.
He signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints in 2009, which led to a Super Bowl ring that first season. Injuries hampered his second year with the Saints, which led to his retirement in 2011. The Los Angeles arrest report states Sharper is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds.
CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton and Stella Chan contributed to this report.
