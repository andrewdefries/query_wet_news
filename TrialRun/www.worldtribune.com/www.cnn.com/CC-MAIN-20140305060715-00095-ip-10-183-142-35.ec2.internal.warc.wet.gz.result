WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a major victory for disabled Americans, the Supreme Court Monday ruled they deserve equal access and accommodation at government buildings, such as courthouses and schools, in all states.A divided Court concluded states were not exempt from provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), such as those requiring elevators or ramps in public facilities.Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the 5-4 majority, said previous government efforts have failed to adequately remedy "a pattern of unequal treatment in the administration of a wide range of public services, programs, and activities, including the penal system, public education, and voting."The key swing vote for the majority was cast by moderate-conservative Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. In sharply worded dissent, Chief Justice William Rehnquist criticized the other justices for taking an improper "wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled." Rehnquist said in Lane's case, "a violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a judicial proceeding. We have never held that a person has a constitutional right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance."Rehnquist was supported by fellow conservative justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas.The Supreme Court building is handicapped-accessible, and a number of disabled spectators were inside and watched the court arguments earlier this year. (January arguments)The proceedings considered what circumstances the ADA would apply to states.The ADA, passed in 1990, requires the government, businesses and other private groups to accommodate the disabled. There have been legal disputes ever since over whether states have 11th Amendment immunity to provisions of the ADA.Tennessee residents filed lawsuitThe case was prompted by a lawsuit brought by Tennessee residents George Lane, Beverly Jones and four other disabled people.Lane was unable to walk after a 1997 car accident in which he was accused of driving on the wrong side of the road. A woman was killed in the crash, and Lane faced misdemeanor charges of reckless driving.He appeared at a Pol County courthouse that had no elevator, and was forced to drag himself up two flights of stairs to attend a hearing. He refused to do so for a second hearing and was arrested for failing to appear, even though he had told the judge beforehand of his situation.Lane claimed security officers laughed at his situation, and he wanted to sue Tennessee for $100,000 in damages.State officials denied that accusation, and said Lane refused help getting up the stairs. The judge also agreed to move the case to a ground-floor courtroom, but Lane rejected the offer, saying he wanted to be treated like everyone else.Jones is a certified court reporter who is confined to a wheelchair from paralysis caused by a broken back she suffered in a 1984 car wreck. She experienced extreme difficulty getting into at least two dozen state courthouses, and said she is continually humiliated having to be carried into buildings without wheelchair access.Lane is currently in a state prison on unrelated assault charges. He now uses an artificial leg to get around. Two years after his incident in the courthouse, Polk County installed an elevator.And Jones eventually sued the state for $250,000, saying her livelihood was threatened by the lack of wheelchair access. She is paralyzed from the waist down.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A long-awaited report which concluded Saddam Hussein did not possess stockpiles of illicit weapons at the time of the U.S. invasion has intensified the debate about the decision to go to war.The CIA report, authored by Charles Duelfer, who advises the director of central intelligence on Iraqi weapons, said Iraq's WMD program had essentially destroyed in 1991 and Saddam ended Iraq's nuclear program after the 1991 Gulf War.The report did say, however, that Iraq worked hard to cheat on United Nations-imposed sanctions and retain the capability to resume production of weapons of mass destruction at some time in the future.In the U.S., Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, seized on the report as political ammunition against the Bush administration."Despite the efforts to focus on Saddam's desires and intentions, the bottom line is Iraq did not have either weapon stockpiles or active production capabilities at the time of the war," Rockefeller said in a press release."The report does further document Saddam's attempts to deceive the world and get out from under the sanctions, but the fact remains, the sanctions combined with inspections were working and Saddam was restrained."British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the report demonstrated the U.N. sanctions were not working and Saddam was "doing his best" to get around them.He said the report made clear that there was "every intention" on Saddam's part to develop WMD and he "never had any intention of complying with U.N. resolutions."But Britain's opposition Conservative Party said the report again proved Blair had lied about Saddam's weapons.Tory leader Michael Howard said the premier "did not tell the truth about the intelligence he received."The Liberal Democrats said the report was further proof that the government had been wrong to take Britain to war. The party's foreign affairs spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell, said: "Brick by brick, the government's case for going to war is being demolished."Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh backed Blair's remarks, pointing to evidence that Saddam was diverting money from the U.N. food-for-oil humanitarian program to buy new weapons. "We know Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We know Saddam Hussein used weapons of mass destruction. Those who see evidence should go to Halabja and to the mass graves."Saddam Hussein was evil. Saddam Hussein was himself a weapon of mass destruction." Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda said Japan -- a staunch U.S. ally -- stood by its decision to back the war because Iraq still posed a threat because it had previously been developing such weapons and it was not clear whether it had abandoned those programs."The Japanese government concludes that the nonexistent of facilities would not question the responsibility of our government, and we believe other governments reached the same conclusion," Hosoda told reporters.Australian Prime Minister John Howard also refused to apologize for Australia's role in the Iraq war.In a nationally televised speech Thursday ahead of Saturday's national elections, Howard did not mention the war, to which he sent 2,000 Australian troops.But he remained defiant as journalists later questioned him about the report."I stand by the decision we took in relation to Iraq," Howard said. "I have no regrets at all about the fact that Saddam Hussein is no longer leading Iraq."David Kay, former Bush-appointed head of the Iraq Survey Group, talked to CNN Thursday about the report issued by his successor.He said "the most meaningful conclusion of" the report "is the failure of our intelligence services and the intelligence services of other western countries" to determine that Iraq had no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction nor means to build them."We need to take that lesson to heart so a next president does not have to go through the same trauma that this one has when you turn out the reasons for going to war to be so different than the actual facts," he said on CNN's American Morning. Speaking on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, Bush maintained Wednesday that the war was the right thing to do and that Iraq stood out as a place where terrorists might get weapons of mass destruction."There was a risk, a real risk, that Saddam Hussein would pass weapons or materials or information to terrorist networks, and in the world after September the 11th, that was a risk we could not afford to take," Bush said.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Seduction tips from famous enchanting womanStory HighlightsScheherazade kept her head on her shoulders by keeping her king interestedHer 1001 stories seduced his mind and soulRelying on physical seduction often leads to heartbreak than happinessExpert: If women want to hear "I do" they need to say "I don't" many timesNext Article in Living » By Karen Salmanshohn	(OPRAH.com) -- Lust, love and like. A healthful, happy love relationship serves up three out of three. A healthful, happy love relationship is a passionate best friendship. Modern women could learn a few things about love and seduction from Scheherazade. Many women think men only care about the lust angle -- finding a hot bod for hot sex. Unfortunately, there are many men who do only care about this. In my book "Prince Harming Syndrome," I explain how relationships that are too focused on sex wind up being what my favorite philosopher buddy Aristotle called a relationship of pleasure -- where you find a sex-mate or a relationship of utility -- where you find an ego-mate or wallet-mate. However, a healthful, happy love relationship is what Aristotle calls a relationship of shared virtue -- when you find a soul mate. Where you each get one another at your core, inspire and support each other to grow into your best possible selves. A relationship of shared virtue is where you feel the whole triumvirate: lust, love and like. Meaning? If you want to fully seduce a man, then you've got to know how to grab a man by more than his you-know-what. You must truly turn on a man's soul! Oprah.com: 5 things that make you sexy If you sleep with a man before you feel safe knowing you connect on a soul-to-soul level, the relationship might start off hot -- but like steam into air, it will rise quickly then -- pfffft -- vanish into vapor. Or worse, you'll wind up getting burnt. This is so important to prioritize, that I'm repeating this reminder in bold italic letters: If you can't stimulate a man in more areas than from the waist down, you will only be attracting a relationship of pleasure or a relationship of utility. And this man will not remain your man for long. Don't Miss Oprah.com: Could you be dating a Prince Harming?
Oprah.com: The No. 1 thing to look for in a man
Oprah.com: How not to be a jerk during your next fight
One of my favorite quotes about love comes from the book "The Little Prince": "It's only with the heart that one can see rightly; what's most important is invisible to the eye." I love that the Little Prince recognized that the heart (another metaphysical word for soul) is the best lens for love -- making this Little Prince a major Prince Charming. Seduction Tip 1 (in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember): If you want to be a man's Princess Charming, you MUST do more than work on tightening your buns or boosting up your boobs! You MUST tap into what I call "The Scheherazade Effect." Oprah.com: What to do before you can find love Remember the tale of Scheherazade and her 1,001 nights? Scheherazade was absolutely a Princess Charming who knew how to grab and stimulate her king's soul. Voilà! The CliffsNotes on Scheherazade: There once was a king who got very bored with the women in his life very quickly. He would marry a new virgin, "shtup" her, then send her pretty self away pretty much immediately... to be beheaded. Talk about a bad breakup, huh? And talk about a King Harming, huh? Anyway, this king killed thousands of women by the time he finally met the enchantingly different Scheherazade. What made Scheherazade enchantingly different? Scheherazade loved to read books and had lots of fascinating ideas and interests to share. Wisely educated in morality and kindness, she had a passion for poetry, philosophy, sciences and arts. She kept the king on the edge of his bed -- not with mere alluring sexual positions -- but with alluring stories to be told, each more exciting than the next. And so the king kept Scheherazade alive -- eagerly anticipating each new tale -- until, lo and behold, 1,001 adventurous nights passed -- along with three sons -- and the king not only learned to love Scheherazade, but he made her his queen. Talk about living happily ever after, huh? The lesson learned? It's very seductive to a man when you, as a full-bodied and full souled woman, have passions in your life you can share to keep him inspired, titillated, growing and thriving. Seduction Tip 2 (again in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember): The more passions you have in your life, the more passion your man will have for you! Oprah.com: 4 steps to finding your passion My friend David told me he fell in love with his wonderful wife of 13 years because he adored her "world lens" -- all the interesting perspectives she shared about life, all her passionate insights and enthusiastic talents. David's idea of love is being turned on by how his paramour looked at the world, instead of simply focusing on how she looked to the world. Which is why David is a 3-D Prince Charming who's found his Scheherazade. Unfortunately, I believe too many women feel that the best way to catch a guy is with the bait of their (to word it politely) "vajayjay." But if that is the main lure for love, then why aren't little "vajayjay icons" found on Valentine's Day cards? I'm kidding -- but I am serious! If you sleep with a man too soon, you risk being dizzied by an "oxytocin high," and you will not know until you're already emotionally entrenched if the two of you have a true soul-nurturing connection. Plus, even in this modern world, you also risk the man respecting you less if you give sex away too quickly. It's timeless psychology. The harder you are to win, the bigger your estimated prize value. Many men do not want to belong to a club that has touched their members too quickly. It's the ol' Dr. Ejaculate/Mr. Hide Syndrome. As soon as the man comes, he'll want to go. Seduction Tip 3 (back to bold italics one last time for good measure): If you ever wanna hear "I do," you have to start off saying a lot of sexual "I don'ts." For this reason, I recommend to the women I coach that they do not drink alcohol on dates. Staying alcohol-free will help ensure you clearly "hear" who a guy is, not simply "see" who he is. You don't want to be hypnotized by superficial qualities, like his looks and wealth. Plus, being alcohol-free will help make sure you don't move too swiftly forward physically (a.k.a. it will ensure you keep your vajayjay in your skirt!). Meaning? My overall big seduction tip for luring in healthful, happy relationship is to STOP trying to be seductive! If you focus too much on seducing a man with your body and beauty, you will only be luring in a man with your body and beauty. If you want to wisely be in a lust, love and like relationship of shared virtue, it's far more important that you excite a man's soul. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life

Cyber crime poses threat to e-commerceBy Kevin Voigt, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe past 12 months have been a banner year for cybercrime87 percent of e-mail traffic the past year was spamAnalyst: "The way it's trending now, the Web could be so full of rubbish that people won't trust it.'

Computer Crime
(CNN) -- The past 12 months have been a banner year for cyber crime. And that could be bad news for the future of e-commerce. "At current trends, in three or four years people will start to think twice about transacting on the Web, individuals and businesses," said Michael Fraser, director of the communications law centre at the University of Technology Sydney. "The way it's trending now, the Web could be so full of rubbish that people won't trust it," Fraser said. "That could destroy the potential of the whole knowledge economy, which so many developed economies are counting on for the competitive advantage." According to antivirus maker Symantec, 87 percent of e-mail traffic in the past year was spam, compared to just under 70 percent in 2008. More than 40 trillion spam messages were sent according to Symantec, which monitors about a third of the world's e-mail traffic. That's about 5,000 spam messages for every person on the planet. More of that spam is harboring malicious software, or "malware," -- 2 percent of spam contained malware, a 900 percent increase from the previous year. Video: 2009 good year for cyber crime
Malware comes in a variety of forms that can search computers for bank information and personal details for identity theft, or hijack computers to become foot soldiers in a spamming army of zombie "botnets" -- often unbeknownst to the owner. In Australia alone, an estimated 10 percent of computers are infected with malware, Fraser said. "And we're relatively low because we have less (broadband penetration) than many other countries," he said. The past year saw an explosion of individuals on social networking sites such as Facebook having their accounts compromised and spam being sent to friends within their network. In this way, cyber criminals have made the attacks more personal because they are sending out messages appropriating victims' names, says Marian Merritt, an Internet safety advisor for Norton, the antivirus brand produced by Symantec. "In the past, people felt annoyed by spam, they didn't really feel a sense of being attacked," Merritt said. "But if your Facebook account is hacked, it's embarrassing." The past year has seen the rise of "scareware" -- malware that parrots a legitimate antivirus software program and then infects the computer with "the very malware it purports to protect against," a Symantec report said. For a 12-month period ending June 30, Symantec received 43 million reports of scareware installation attempts. "That took a lot of us in the industry by surprise the past year," Merritt said. "You get a pop-up ad saying, 'you have multiple viruses' then asks you to download the antivirus software. Once you download those programs, they hold you hostage." The speed of news The past year saw the rising speed and popularity of malware spam and Web sites with touts related to current events and celebrity news. "Who killed Michael Jackson?" "Get swine flu medicine here" and "Full eBook Harry Potter" were some popular online traps to open dangerous e-mail attachments or be directed to Web sites' malware. "If you want to know what spam will be hitting tomorrow, look at Google Trends today," said Merritt, referring to Google's site that shows hot topics and searches by its users.

One of the most alarming incidents in 2009 for governments and policy makers was the July 4 attacks on U.S. government sites, such as the White House, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq -- followed a few days later by similar attacks on Web sites in South Korea. According to a research paper by antivirus maker McAfee, both attacks were made by the same "botnet" of 50,000 computers, which spammed targets with so many e-mails their IT systems were overwhelmed. Fact BoxCybercrime Prevention -- Have antivirus software, anti-spyware and firewall -- Never respond to spam -- Don't open suspicious emails or attachments -- Never provide passwords or personal information to unsolicited emails or Web sites -- When asked to 'allow' or 'deny' an application access to the Internet, choose deny unless you are confident in the safety of the site you are accessing -- When shopping or banking online, make sure website contains an "s" after http (as in https) . Look for the 'lock' icon in lower right corner Sources: Symantec and Trend Micro
North Korea was suspected as the originator of the attack, leading Dmitiri Alperovitch, vice president of threat research at McAfee, to suggest one motivation of the attack "could have been to test the impact of flooding South Korean networks and the transcontinental communications between the U.S. government ... (which) would provide them with a significant advantage in case of a surprise attack." The attack highlights the problem of security on the Internet -- a transnational attack, using commercial services and tens of thousands of personal computers. To fight the attacks would take strong local and international laws on cyber security, a great deal of cooperation among commercial providers and effective systems to report the crimes -- none of which is happening today, Fraser said. "The community doesn't know where to turn to when these crimes occur, and the police don't know how to report it or record it, and prosecutors and court systems have a hard time coping with cases that involve gigabytes of evidence," he said. Looking ahead to 2010, antivirus maker Trend Micro predicts that there will be more attacks on Mac operating systems. Previously ignored by malware makers because of its relatively low market share, the booming popularity of iPhones is drawing the attention of cybercriminals. "As the mobile OS landscape changes, and with devices comprising a huge amount of memory and storing a host of sensitive data, devices such as the iPhone and Google Android may increase as popular targets for bad guys," Trend Micro reports in its December report, "the Future of Threats and Threat Technologies." The introduction this year of domain names in languages other than English -- such as Russian, Chinese and Arabic -- will also expand the hunting grounds for cyber crime, Trend Micro reports.

Ships collide in North Sea, killing 4 From Dominique Van Heerden, CNN
updated 5:47 PM EST, Thu December 6, 2012
A red buoy marks the spot where the cargo ship "Baltic Ace" sank in the North Sea after colliding with a car carrier, December 5.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Search is called off for crew members missing after a ship collision Wednesday evening
NEW: Passing ships have been told to be on the lookout, Netherlands Coast Guard says
Thirteen people are rescued; seven are missing
The Baltic Ace began sinking immediately after the collision
(CNN) -- The search for the missing crew members from a North Sea cargo ship collision has been called off Thursday afternoon, the Netherlands Coast Guard said in a statement.
The search will not be resuming and passing ships have been told to be on the lookout, the Netherlands Coast Guard said.
At least four people are dead and seven others missing after a container vessel collided with a car carrier Wednesday evening, the Netherlands Coast Guard said.
The carrier Baltic Ace began sinking immediately after it collided with the container vessel in a busy shipping lane, about 60 kilometers (32 miles) west of Rotterdam, according to Coast Guard spokesman Peter Verburg.
Thirteen crew members were rescued and taken to hospitals in Rotterdam and at the Koksijde Air Base near Ostend, Belgium.
Those rescued were suffering from hypothermia and minor injuries, the spokesman said.
The nationality of the crew was not immediately known.
The Baltic Ace had been en route from Zeebrugge, Belgium, to Kotka, Finland; the container vessel was en route from Grangemouth, Britain, to Antwerp, Belgium.

Apparently This Matters: Ruzzle
By Jarrett Bellini, CNN
updated 1:07 PM EST, Fri January 4, 2013 | Filed under: Social Media
This is Ruzzle. Apparently, a lot of Twitter users play it at 10 a.m. on Sundays.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Apparently This Matters" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at items trending online
This week, Jarrett investigates the growing appeal of Ruzzle
The mobile game has more than 9 million players, including Jarrett's mom
Don't challenge her; she's good. Better than Jarrett, anyway
Editor's note: Each week in "Apparently This Matters," CNN's Jarrett Bellini applies his warped sensibilities to trending topics in social media and random items of interest on the Internet.
(CNN) -- On Sunday morning, a strange word suddenly started trending for me on Twitter. The word was Ruzzle. I had no idea what it meant, so I did the smart thing and asked my dog.
"Mikey, what's a Ruzzle?"
Through nonverbal communication, he indicated that it might have something to do with his groin. Though, to be fair, he'd been indicating this for the better part of an hour. And with varying degrees of intensity.
So, just to be sure, I Googled this strange new word and discovered that Ruzzle was actually a popular game app for your mobile device. And for some reason -- I still have no idea why -- at 10 a.m. on Sunday, lots of people were tweeting about it.
Thus, I had to learn more. But not really. I don't generally care on Sundays. Or wear pants.
Nevertheless, a little half-hearted research revealed that this uber-popular word game seemed to be the offspring of a wild and kinky one-night-stand between Boggle and Scrabble. Apparently, things got a little crazy at the bar, there was a shared cab ride and, lo and behold, we now have Ruzzle.
The underlying message: Be careful with tequila, kids.
"Apparently This Matters" Is Jarrett Bellini's weekly (and somewhat random) look at social-media trends.
After downloading the app and opening a game account (for which I was denied the user name "RealGilbertGottfried") I soon learned that Ruzzle consists of three two-minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle. Like Boggle.
Each letter is also given a point value based on difficulty, and some even award extra points by doubling or tripling the letter or overall word score. Like Scrabble.
In the end, the player with the most points after three rounds is the one who doesn't get shingles.
Obviously, it's a game of high stakes.
"Hi, boss. Yeah, it's Hank. I won't be in this week. What's that? Yes. Ruzzle. Again."
OK, so the player with the most points actually just wins. However, if you're competitive like me, losing is just as bad as a blistering skin rash. Which is why playing my mom was a horrible idea. She always wins. At everything.
But I'm a glutton for punishment and told her to sign up so she could give me something to write about and, perhaps, humiliate me in the process. Which she promptly did on her first attempt: 859-805. The ensuing e-mail conversation went like this:
Mom: "Good game."
Me: "I've got your good game RIGHT HERE!"
Mom: "Oh, my, that doesn't sound nice ..."
I'm a particularly sore loser. And she's gone on to destroy me three more times.
"I just want you to play as well as you can, dear."
Constantly getting beat by your mom. Man, what a drag.
Since then, I've at least found a way to defeat two random strangers whom I've played against, and this has temporarily restored my limited sense of self-worth. Fortunately, there are plenty more strangers to go around.
And "plenty" is a bit of an understatement.
The maker of the game, Stockholm-based MAG Interactive, boasts that it now has more than 9 million players in over 100 countries. It's also available in 10 languages. I'm currently utilizing the English version of the game because, after 34 years, I've somehow managed to grasp it at a solid third-grade level.
Much like one Twittererer who oh-so-intelligently chimed in on Sunday morning with "...pop a book open. Then you'll stop loosing [sic] in Ruzzle."
Sage advice. For him.
So Ruzzle is officially something that matters, and, at press time, it was the No. 4 overall free app in America. It was also the No. 1 word game, apparently beating out Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and Shared Needles with Friends.
That last one might not actually be a game.
Anyway, now I'm included among the millions who play Ruzzle. But probably not for long. I get bored easily, and my interest is already starting to wane.
Plus, I just keep "loosing" to my mom.

More spin than solutions as spending cuts near
By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 5:32 PM EST, Tue February 26, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Some conservatives protest planned release of certain immigration detainees
Military leaders say readiness will be compromised if the cuts take full effect
Republicans seek to blame Obama and Democrats for the situation
The two sides remain divided over taxes as part of the solution
Washington (CNN) -- Three days before forced spending cuts portrayed by most as an economic body blow, President Barack Obama and Republican rivals relied on spin versus substance Tuesday in trying to prod a deeply divided Congress into action to avert the harshest impacts.
Government officials and military leaders continued warning of serious consequences if Congress fails to agree on an alternative to the mandatory $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends on September 30.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Tuesday the automatic cuts will slow the already sluggish economy, harming the still-moderate recovery from recession.
Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it will release "several hundred" immigration detainees to "less costly" forms of supervision because of the imminent cuts, known in Washington jargon as sequestration.
That brought immediate protests from some conservative Republicans. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called the move "pure political posturing and the height of absurdity."
Republican leaders have criticized Obama administration warnings as scare tactics, but also said the cuts would be bad policy and should be changed. Only rigid fiscal conservatives have backed the concept of mandatory deep spending cuts as a painful first step of deficit reduction.
Obama headed to military country in Virginia, where local residents will bear the brunt of cuts to defense spending, to urge Newport News shipyard workers to pressure Congress for a solution.
Insisting he wasn't interested in political spin, Obama acknowledged the cuts set to take effect Friday "won't be felt overnight, but it will be real," adding it means lost jobs and weakened national security.
He called the situation "a self-inflicted wound that doesn't have to happen," saying the goal of reducing the federal deficit can be achieved in a smarter way if Republicans will compromise on including additional tax revenue as part of the solution.
"I need you to keep up the fight. If you do, Congress will listen," said Obama, who spoke with a huge ship propeller as a backdrop.
Talk Back: Who do you believe when it comes to forced budget cuts?
Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner expressed continuing frustration over what he called a lack of leadership by Obama and Senate Democrats.
The House passed two bills in the last Congress that would have replaced the mandatory cuts of sequestration with other reductions that avoid harming the military, a concept rejected by Democrats as shifting the impact of deficit reduction to the middle class and needy Americans.
"We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something," Boehner told reporters on Tuesday.
In response, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said bills passed by the previous Congress no longer matter, and that the Constitution requires legislation involving appropriations and revenue to originate in the House.
"There's not much that is being accomplished by what they are doing," Pelosi said of House GOP leaders, calling their refusal to act on the matter "irresponsible" and "mindless."
The forced cuts were written into law in 2011 to be intentionally indiscriminate so that legislators would compromise on an alternative instead of allowing them to take effect.
However, election year politics in 2012 prevented an agreement, and the continuing partisan divide over how to reduce or at least control chronic federal deficits and debt caused the widely opposed spending cuts to become imminent.
Conflicting messages in the increasingly heated debate raised confusion about exactly what will happen if the spending cuts go into effect.
At a House subcommittee hearing on Tuesday, the heads of the nation's military services warned of serious problems if the full effect of cuts are allowed to happen.
Opinion: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame
Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said the pending cuts would hollow out the military and were "not in the best interest of our national security."
In particular, he said reduced spending for this year would reduce training, diminish the special operations command and result in layoffs and furloughs of civilian staff that will delay medical care for soldiers and their families.
Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told the panel that the spending cuts were "both terrible politics and terrible policy" that would impair the nation's overall military readiness.
That contrasted with conservative Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who said Monday that the cuts won't be as harmful as the Obama administration warns.
The veteran senator conceded that he initially agreed with dire predictions from the administration and top Republicans of major harm to the nation's military. After looking into the situation, Cornyn said he now argues that the Pentagon will still see its budget go up despite the forced cuts.
Senate Republicans are considering a proposal this week that could alleviate some impacts of the cuts by giving the president flexibility to decide where they would occur.
The proposal is the GOP counter to a Democratic plan to replace the sequester with more tax revenue collected from millionaires, as well as eliminating agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan next year.
Top Senate Republican doubts damage from defense cuts
Under the law that created the forced spending cuts, neither the Pentagon or government agencies can shift money to protect some programs or operations from reduced funding.
While Republicans are divided over how much flexibility Obama should get to avoid the worst impacts of the cuts, they appear unified in opposing any increase in tax revenue to partially offset them.
A January agreement that raised tax rates on top income earners while putting off the forced cuts for two months provided all tax revenue Republicans were willing to consider, party leaders say.
"We can either secure these reductions more intelligently or we can do it the president's way with across the board cuts," Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. "But one thing Americans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace spending reductions we already agreed to."
Obama addressed that viewpoint in his remarks in Virginia, saying there were "too many Republicans in Congress right now who refuse to compromise even an inch when it comes to closing tax loopholes and special interest tax breaks."
"That's what's holding things up right now," the president said. "Keep in mind, nobody's asking them to raise income tax rates. All we're asking is to consider closing tax loopholes and deductions that (Boehner) said he was willing to do just a few months ago."
The full impact of the cuts won't be felt for at least a month, until after a March 27 deadline for Congress to agree on extending funding for the government for the rest of the fiscal year.
An agreement on the overall government funding could soften or eliminate the cuts and much of the hyperbole this week involved posturing for the broader debate of coming weeks.

Lady Gaga, Perez Hilton feud on Twitter
By Sarah Aarthun, CNN
updated 7:05 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lady Gaga accuses the blogger of stalking her after he house-hunts at her NYC building
Hilton says he learned later that her building was among those he looked at Sunday
The former friends have not said why they had a falling out
(CNN) -- The latest celebrity Twitter feud erupted Sunday between two heavyweights of the social medium.
In one corner: pop superstar Lady Gaga and her nearly 40 million followers. In the other: pop culture blogger Perez Hilton and his 6.1 million Twitter fans.
Who won the war of 140 characters? It depends on whom you ask.
The feud between the former friends appears to stem from several incidents: Hilton tweeted Thursday that Katy Perry's new single, "Roar," is better than Gaga's latest song, "Applause." On Friday, Gaga, who is in the midst of a comeback following a serious tear to her right hip, cryptically referenced a text from Hilton that appeared to make light of her injury. "Still have the text Perez sent me of me in a wheelchair with the words KARMA written across + Madonna pointing a gun at me," she tweeted.
But Gaga went into Twitter overdrive Sunday, accusing Hilton of stalking her, after one of her followers alerted her that he was at Gaga's apartment building in New York.
"STAY AWAY FROM ME + MY FAMILY YOU ARE SICK TRYING TO RENT AN APARTMENT IN MY BUILDING TO STALK ME. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!" she tweeted.
Hilton, who lives in Los Angeles, announced last week that he is moving to New York as he raises his new son, born via a surrogate in February.
He responded to Gaga's tweets with a post on his blog Sunday night, titled "A Statement On Lady GaGa's Lies." In the statement, he explains he was house-hunting and later learned one of the buildings he looked at was, in fact, Gaga's building.
"After a day of innocent house-hunting, I am devastated and my heart hurts that my former very good friend, a person I used to call my 'wifey' and traveled the world with, is making very public and very untrue allegations about me on Twitter," he wrote, adding "it is still too painful" to reveal what caused the end of their friendship.
He said that as a result of Gaga's series of tweets Sunday, her fans have sent him death threats and posted derogatory comments about his 6-month-old son.
"If her fans want to send a message of support to Lady GaGa, they should buy her music," he wrote, a thinly veiled reference to Gaga's new single being declared a flop by several media outlets.
And while Gaga vowed "I've been quiet for a long time, not this time," Hilton appeared to be getting the last word.
"The truth will all eventually come out. It usually does!" he wrote.

White House responds to criticism of clemency offer - September 2, 1999
White House responds to criticism of clemency offer September 2, 1999
Web posted at: 2:27 p.m. EDT (1827 GMT)
AUBURN, New York (CNN) -- The White House said Thursday that President Bill Clinton's controversial offer of clemency to 16 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group was extended only to members of the organization "not associated with the more violent acts that led to injuries."
Congressional Republicans are highly critical of the president's offer, and the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee issued subpoenas Wednesday for the records the president relied on in making his decision.
The committee also subpoenaed members of the Clinton Administration -- including Attorney General Janet Reno and Deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills -- in connection with the president's offer of clemency for 16 convicted Puerto Rican separatists.
Rep. Dan Burton (R-Indiana), committee chairman, issued the subpoenas and sought all documents and records from the White House, Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Prisons relating to the clemency issue. Copies of the subpoenas were obtained by CNN.
Two leading congressional Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN there is some nervousness in the party that House Republicans will force a vote on a resolution voicing disapproval of the president's offer. One of the sources said the issue was certain to be a subject of debate within the Democratic caucus when Congress returns to work next week.
A senior White House official familiar with the process said lawyers for the 16 members of the FALN -- the acronym for the Spanish rendering of the Armed Forces of National Liberation -- were meeting one-by-one with their clients, who are scattered at federal prisons across the country.
The 16 must accept the president's conditions for clemency, including renouncing violence. Eleven would be eligible for immediate release, two would have to serve some additional time and three already released would see their fines reduced.
The White House official said the administration was anxious for an answer from the attorneys, "We are nearing the end of the process and if we don't hear back soon we will tell them the process is ending," the official said.
The official said that pressure was to force a decision, not to indicate the president was considering withdrawing the offer. "That would be operating in bad faith," the official said.
Some Republicans have accused Clinton of making the offer of clemency to boost first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's expected Senate candidacy in New York, a state with a large Puerto Rican population. The White House strongly denied that.
"The president made the decision on the merits," White House spokesman Jake Siewert told reporters covering the president's vacation in upstate New York.
A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign said she supports the clemency offer - provided those covered renounce violence.
Several people injured in F.A.L.N attacks have criticized the president's offer. Siewert said there had been "misleading reporting" on the issue and said the clemency was offered only to "those not associated with the more violent acts that led to injuries."
Asked if the White House was concerned about the congressional inquiries, Siewert said, "Congress has a right to do whatever it wants."
Congress has been considering conducting hearings on the clemency issue, with many members publicly voicing concern over published reports that the Justice Department never made a formal recommendation on the clemency question to the White House, as is usual in such cases.
Many law enforcement officials opposed clemency for the nationalists, saying it would be bowing to terrorism at a time when the administration has been cracking down on terrorists.
The separatists were convicted on a variety of charges, ranging from bomb-making and conspiracy to armed robbery. They are affiliated with FALN -- a Puerto Rican independence group, which law enforcement officials blame for at least 130 bombings in the United States and Puerto Rico between 1974 and 1983. Six people were killed, and scores of others injured in those attacks.
Supporters of the separatists emphasized that the 11 men and five women who were offered clemency never were directly connected to an act of murder or violence. The activists have already served 14 to 19 years in prison.
In exchange for clemency, the separatists must renounce the use of violence to achieve political goals and agree to the traditional parole terms. The separatists have yet to agree to the clemency terms.
James Wilson, a spokesman for Burton's committee, said the White House has until September 15 to comply with the subpoena and turn over all "relevant" documents.
CNN's John King, Jonathan Aiken and Bill Mears contributed to this report.

The women who sold their daughters into sex slavery
A neighborhood in Cambodia is a global hotspot for the child sex trade. The people selling the children? Too often, their parents. CNN Freedom Project and Mira Sorvino, award-winning actress and human rights activist, investigate.
By Tim Hume, Lisa Cohen and Mira Sorvino

Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN)
When a poor family in Cambodia fell afoul of loan sharks, the mother asked her youngest daughter to take a job. But not just any job.
The girl, Kieu, was taken to a hospital and examined by a doctor, who issued her a "certificate of virginity." She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.
Kieu was 12 years old.
"I did not know what the job was," says Kieu, now 14 and living in a safehouse. She says she returned home from the experience "very heartbroken." But her ordeal was not over.
After the sale of her virginity, her mother had Kieu taken to a brothel where, she says, "they held me like I was in prison."
She was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.
"Selling my daughter was heartbreaking, but what can I say?" says Kieu's mother, Neoung, in an interview with a CNN crew that travelled to Phnom Penh to hear her story. Cambodia's hidden child brothels
Karaoke bars are a common front for child prostitution. Mira Sorvino details going behind the scenes of this illicit trade. Read more »
Like other local mothers CNN spoke to, she blames poverty for her decision to sell her daughter, saying a financial crisis drove her into the clutches of the traffickers who make their livelihoods preying on Cambodian children.
"It was because of the debt, that's why I had to sell her," she says. "I don't know what to do now, because we cannot move back to the past."
It is this aspect of Cambodia's appalling child sex trade that Don Brewster, a 59-year-old American resident of the neighborhood, finds most difficult to countenance.
"I can't imagine what it feels like to have your mother sell you, to have your mother waiting in the car while she gets money for you to be raped," he says. "It's not that she was stolen from her mother -- her mother gave the keys to the people to rape her."
Brewster, a former pastor, moved from California to Cambodia with wife Bridget in 2009, after a harrowing investigative mission trip to the neighborhood where Kieu grew up -- Svay Pak, the epicenter of child trafficking in the Southeast Asian nation. "Svay Pak is known around the world as a place where pedophiles come to get little girls," says Brewster, whose organization, Agape International Missions (AIM), has girls as young as four in its care, rescued from traffickers and undergoing rehabilitation in its safehouses.
In recent decades, he says, this impoverished fishing village – where a daughter's virginity is too often seen as a valuable asset for the family – has become a notorious child sex hotspot.
"When we came here three years ago and began to live here, 100% of the kids between 8 and 12 were being trafficked," says Brewster. The local sex industry sweeps up both children from the neighborhood -- sold, like Kieu, by their parents – as well as children trafficked in from the countryside, or across the border from Vietnam. "We didn't believe it until we saw vanload after vanload of kids." Global center for pedophiles
Weak law enforcement, corruption, grinding poverty and the fractured social institutions left by the country's turbulent recent history have helped earn Cambodia an unwelcome reputation for child trafficking, say experts.
UNICEF estimates that children account for a third of the 40,000-100,000 people in the country's sex industry. Svay Pak, a dusty shantytown on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, is at the heart of this exploitative trade.
As one of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in one of Asia's poorest countries – nearly half the population lives on less than $2 per day -- the poverty in the settlement is overwhelming. The residents are mostly undocumented Vietnamese migrants, many of whom live in ramshackle houseboats on the murky Tonle Sap River, eking out a living farming fish in nets tethered to their homes.
It's a precarious existence. The river is fickle, the tarp-covered houseboats fragile. Most families here scrape by on less than a dollar a day, leaving no safety net for when things go wrong – such as when Kieu's father fell seriously ill with tuberculosis, too sick to maintain the nets that contained their livelihood. The family fell behind on repayments of a debt.
In desperation, Kieu's mother, Neoung, sold her virginity to a Cambodian man of "maybe more than 50," who had three children of his own, Kieu says. The transaction netted the family only $500, more than the $200 they had initially borrowed but a lot less than the thousands of dollars they now owed a loan shark. So Neoung sent her daughter to a brothel to earn more. "They told me when the client is there, I have to wear short shorts and a skimpy top," says Kieu. "But I didn't want to wear them and then I got blamed." Her clients were Thai and Cambodian men, who, she says, knew she was very young.

Don Brewster, a former pastor from California, is the founder and director of Agape International Missions, an organization dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating the victims of child trafficking in Cambodia and smashing the networks that exploit them. He moved to Cambodia with his wife in 2009 after a harrowing investigative mission trip to the neighborhood.
"When they sleep with me, they feel very happy," she says. "But for me, I feel very bad."
The men who abuse the children of Svay Pak fit a number of profiles. They include pedophile sex tourists, who actively seek out sex with prepubescent children, and more opportunistic "situational" offenders, who take advantage of opportunities in brothels to have sex with adolescents. Sex tourists tend to hail from affluent countries, including the West, South Korea, Japan and China, but research suggests Cambodian men remain the main exploiters of child prostitutes in their country.
Mark Capaldi is a senior researcher for Ecpat International, an organization committed to combating the sexual exploitation of children.
"In most cases when we talk about child sexual exploitation, it's taking place within the adult sex industry," says Capaldi. "We tend to often hear reports in the media about pedophilia, exploitation of very young children. But the majority of sexual exploitation of children is of adolescents, and that's taking place in commercial sex venues." The abusers would often be local, situational offenders, he says. Research suggests some of the Asian perpetrators are "virginity seekers," for whom health-related beliefs around the supposedly restorative or protective qualities of virgins factor into their interest in child sex.
Whatever the profile of the perpetrator, the abuse they inflict on their victims, both girls and boys, is horrific. Trafficked children in Cambodia have been subjected to rape by multiple offenders, filmed performing sex acts and left with physical injuries -- not to mention psychological trauma -- from their ordeals, according to research.
In recent years, various crackdowns in Svay Pak have dented the trade, but also pushed it underground. Today, Brewster says, there are more than a dozen karaoke bars operating as brothels along the road to the neighborhood, where two years ago there was none. Even today, he estimates a majority of girls in Svay Park are being trafficked.
Virgins for sale
Kieu's relative, Sephak, who lives nearby, is another survivor. (CNN is naming the victims in this case at the request of the girls themselves, as they want to speak out against the practice of child sex trafficking.)
Sephak was 13 when she was taken to a hospital, issued a certificate confirming her virginity, and delivered to a Chinese man in a Phnom Penh hotel room. She was returned after three nights. Sephak says her mother was paid $800.
"When I had sex with him, I felt empty inside. I hurt and I felt very weak," she says. "It was very difficult. I thought about why I was doing this and why my mom did this to me." After her return, her mother began pressuring her daughter to work in a brothel.
Toha listens to her mother explain how she came to sell her to sex traffickers. She no longer lives with her family, opting instead to live in a residence for trafficking survivors run by Brewster's organization -- but still provides her family some financial support from her new job.
Not far away from Sephak's family home, connected to the shore via a haphazard walkway of planks that dip beneath the water with each footfall, is the houseboat where Toha grew up.
The second of eight children, none of whom attend school, Toha was sold for sex by her mother when she was 14. The transaction followed the same routine: medical certificate, hotel, rape. About two weeks after she returned to Svay Pak, she says, the man who had bought her virginity began calling, requesting to see her again. Her mother urged her to go. The pressure drove her to despair. "I went to the bathroom and cut my arms. I cut my wrists because I wanted to kill myself," Toha says. A friend broke down the door to the bathroom and came to her aid.
Mothers as sex traffickers
CNN met with the mothers of Kieu, Sephak and Toha in Svay Pak to hear their accounts of why they chose to expose their daughters to sexual exploitation.
Kieu's mother, Neoung, had come to Svay Pak from the south of the country in search of a better life when Kieu was just a baby. But life in Svay Pak, she would learn, wasn't easy.
Why Cambodia?
How has this Southeast Asian nation become a hotspot for pedophiles? Poverty, corruption and a brutal reign of terror have all played a part in making Cambodian children vulnerable to adult predators. Read more »
When her husband's tuberculosis rendered him too sick to properly maintain the nets on the family's fish pond, the family took on a $200 loan at extortionate rates from a loan shark. It has now ballooned to more than $9,000. "The debt that my husband and I have is too big, we can't pay it off," she says. "What can you do in a situation like this?"
"Virginity selling" was widespread in the community, and Neoung saw it as a legitimate option to make some income. "They think it is normal," she says. "I told her, 'Kieu, your dad is sick and can't work… Do you agree to do that job to contribute to your parents?'"
"I know that I did wrong so I feel regret about it, but what can I do?" she says. "We cannot move back to the past."
But she adds she would never do it again.
Sephak's mother, Ann, has a similar story. Ann moved to Svay Pak when her father came to work as a fish farmer. She and her husband have serious health problems.
"We are very poor, so I must work hard," she says. "It's still not enough to live by and we're sick all the time."
The family fell on hard times. When a storm roared through the region, their house was badly damaged, their fish got away, and they could no longer afford to eat. In crisis, the family took out a loan that eventually spiraled to about $6000 in debt, she says. With money-lenders coming to her home and threatening her, Ann made the decision to take up an offer from a woman who approached her promising big money for her daughter's virginity.
"I saw other people doing it and I didn't think it through," she says. "If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't do that to my daughter."
On her houseboat, as squalls of rain lash the river, Toha's mother Ngao sits barefoot before the television taking pride of place in the main living area, and expresses similar regrets. On the wall hangs a row of digitally enhanced portraits of her husband and eight children. They are dressed in smart suits and dresses, superimposed before an array of fantasy backdrops: an expensive motorcycle, a tropical beach, an American-style McMansion.
Life with so many children is hard, she says, so she asked her daughter to go with the men.
She would not do the same again, she says, as she now has access to better support; Agape International Missions offers interest-free loan refinancing to get families out of the debt trap, and factory jobs for rescued daughters and their mothers.

The news of Ngao's betrayal of her daughter has drawn mixed responses from others in the neighborhood, she says. Some mock her for offering up her daughter, others sympathize with her plight. Some see nothing wrong with she did at all.
"Some people say 'It's OK -- just bring your daughter (to the traffickers) so you can pay off the debt and feel better,'" says Ngao.
A new future
Not long after her suicide attempt, Toha was sent to a brothel in southern Cambodia. She endured more than 20 days there, before she managed to get access to a phone, and called a friend. She told the friend to contact Brewster's group, who arranged for a raid on the establishment.
Although children can be found in many brothels across Cambodia -- a 2009 survey of 80 Cambodian commercial sex premises found three-quarters offering children for sex – raids to free them are infrequent.
The country's child protection infrastructure is weak, with government institutions riven with corruption. Cambodia's anti-trafficking law does not even permit police to conduct undercover surveillance on suspected traffickers. General Pol Phie They, the head of Cambodia's anti-trafficking taskforce set up in 2007 to address the issue, says this puts his unit at a disadvantage against traffickers. "We are still limited in prosecuting these violations because first, we lack the expertise and second, we lack the technical equipment," he says. "Sometimes, we see a violation but we can't collect the evidence we need to prosecute the offender."
He admits that police corruption in his country, ranked 160 of 175 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, is hampering efforts to tackle the trade in Svay Pak. "Police in that area probably do have connections with the brothel owners," he concedes.

Toha's nightmare is now over. She earns a steady income, weaving bracelets that are sold in American stores, while she studies for her future. Her dream is to become a social worker, helping other girls who have been through the same ordeal.
Brewster believes that corruption was to blame for nearly thwarting Toha's rescue. In October 2012, after Toha's call for help, AIM formulated plans with another organization to rescue the teen, and involved police. "We get a warrant to shut the place down," recalls Brewster. "Fifteen minutes later, Toha calls and says, 'I don't know what happened, the police just came with the owner and took us to a new place. I'm locked inside and don't know where I am.'"
Fortunately the rescue team were able to establish Toha's new location, and she and other victims were freed and the brothel managers arrested – although not before the owners fled to Vietnam. Toha's testimony against the brothel managers, however, resulted in their prosecutions.
Last month, at the Phnom Penh Municipal Courthouse, husband and wife Heng Vy and Nguyeng Thi Hong were found guilty of procuring prostitution and sentenced to three years in jail. Both were ordered to pay $1,250 to the court, $5,000 to Toha, and smaller sums to three other victims. Brewster was in court to watch the sentencing; a small victory in the context of Cambodia's child trafficking problem, but a victory nonetheless.
"Toha's an amazingly brave girl," he says on the courthouse steps, shortly after the brothel managers were led down to the cells. "Getting a telephone when she's trapped in a brothel to call for help, to saying she would be a witness in front of the police…. She stood up and now people are going to pay the price and girls will be protected. What it will do is bring more Tohas, more girls who are willing to speak, places shut down, bad guys put away."
Like the other victims, Toha now lives in an AIM safehouse, attending school and supporting herself by weaving bracelets, which are sold in stores in the West as a way of providing a livelihood to formerly trafficked children. In the eyes of the community, having a job has helped restore to the girls some of the dignity that was stripped from them by having been sold into trafficking, says Brewster. It has also given them independence from their families -- and with that, the opportunity to build for themselves a better reality than the one that was thrust on them. Now Sephak has plans to become a teacher, Kieu a hairdresser.
For her part, Toha still has contact with her mother – even providing financial support to the family through her earnings – but has become self-reliant. She wants to be a social worker, she says, helping girls who have endured the same hell she has.
"(Toha)'s earning a good living and she has a dream beyond that, you know, to become a counselor and to be able to help other girls," says Brewster. "You see the transformation that's happened to her."
