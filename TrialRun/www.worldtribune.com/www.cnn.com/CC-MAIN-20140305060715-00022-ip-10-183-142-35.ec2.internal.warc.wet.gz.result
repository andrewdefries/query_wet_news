Pacific Palisades
Los Angeles (CNN) -- "Easy Rider" actor Peter Fonda found a body while driving down Sunset Boulevard in the Pacific Palisades community of west Los Angeles on Wednesday, police said. Fonda, 70, noticed that a car had been parked on side street off Sunset Boulevard for two days, so he stopped to check it out, according to Los Angeles Police Homicide Detective Allen Shubert. "He looked in the vehicle and saw a body in there and called the fire department," Shubert said. A man who had committed suicide several days before was slumped over the wheel of the sedan, he said. The man's identity has not been made public, but he was not a celebrity, he said.

America's newest Medal of Honor recipient is leaving the Army By Larry Shaughnessy, CNN Pentagon Producer Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta was awarded the Medal of Honor in November. STORY HIGHLIGHTSSgt. Giunta plans to continue his educationHe was awarded medal in November for valor against TalibanHe has served two tours in Afghanistan Washington (CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta, the nation's only living Medal of Honor recipient for the current wars, is leaving the U.S. Army and will focus on his education, a spokesman said. Giunta will leave in mid-June of this year. He and his wife are planning to move to Fort Collins, Colorado, where he will continue his education using the GI Bill, said Todd Oliver, a spokesman for Giunta's unit in Italy. "Those that know him are not surprised by this," said Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood of the Iowa National Guard. Giunta is an Iowa native and Hapgood acted as the family's point of contact during the media frenzy surrounding his medal. Giunta was awarded the Medal of Honor in November for his deeds in a fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan in October 2007. Giunta "killed one of the guys who was dragging my team leader away, Sgt. (Josh) Brennan," Sgt. Franklin Eckrode, who was in the same squad, told CNN in November. "Wounded another one. Recovered Sgt. Brennan. Brought him back to an area where we could secure him and continue the fight. Started the aid on him." 2010: Giunta receives Medal of Honor

Every member of that platoon was struck by enemy fire that night. The medic, Spc. Hugo Mendoza of El Paso, Texas, was killed. Giunta was hit twice by bullets: One hit his armored vest, the other hit a weapon on his back. Neither caused serious injuries. Giunta went back to work with his unit moments after the attack ended. He served two tours in Afghanistan over seven years. Giunta has been honored a number of times since President Barack Obama awarded him the nation's highest award for valor, most recently at Sunday's Super Bowl in Texas. Giunta joined the Army in 2003 while working at a neighborhood fast-food shop. He went into an Army recruiting station to get a free T-shirt and decided to enlist. Giunta was a specialist serving with the Airborne 503rd Infantry Regiment when his unit was attacked on the night of October 25, 2007, by Taliban fighters who barraged the Americans with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades and Soviet-era large machine guns. According to Defense Department documents, Giunta saw several of his fellow soldiers go down. He ran forward, throwing grenades and returning enemy fire, to help one soldier who had been shot but was still fighting, the documents say. Then he noticed one of the wounded soldiers was missing. Searching for his wounded friend, Brennan, Giunta ran over a hill where, moments before, Taliban fighters had been shooting at him. He was alone, out of sight of his fellow soldiers, in an area that the Taliban had controlled just moments before. Two Taliban fighters were dragging Brennan away. Giunta ran after them, killing one and wounding the other, who ran off. Giunta instantly started providing first aid to Brennan, who later died of his wounds. Giunta's action, however, meant that Brennan was not at the mercy of the Taliban, and his parents would be able to give him a proper burial instead of wondering what became of him. Even though he's leaving the Army, Giunta is entitled to a number of special benefits reserved for Medal of Honor recipients, including a monthly Veterans Affairs pension of more than $1,100 a month for life as well as an invitation to every presidential inauguration and inauguration party.

Hurricane Irene bears down on large East Coast cities By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Delaware's governor: "It's still early for us and it's already hitting us pretty hard"NEW: 30 to 40 homes have been damaged in Lewes, Delaware, a fire spokesman saysBoston joins New York City and others in suspending subway service on SundayAt least 9 have died in three states due to the storm, including a man killed in Virginia Ocean City, Maryland (CNN) -- Residents in several major East Coast cities -- including Washington, Philadelphia and New York -- braced late Saturday for the impact from Hurricane Irene. By Saturday evening, the storm had already knocked out power in more than a million homes, forced more than a million people off the New Jersey shore alone and caused at least nine deaths. Irene weakened somewhat since coming ashore early Saturday near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and it is expected to slowly lose more strength overnight. But it is still a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds around 80 mph and extending 85 miles from its center. Forecasters expect it to remain a hurricane until it once again makes landfall Sunday afternoon in southern New England. While the vast majority heeded calls to evacuate, emergency officials continued to plead with some stubborn residents to head to high ground, warning that heavy rains and a storm surge of 4 to 8 feet could cause widespread flooding of low-lying areas and pose untold dangers to residents from Virginia to Massachusetts. "Living in New York City all my life and never experiencing a hurricane before, I have no idea what to expect," said CNN iReporter Elie Shaby, who lives one block north of where authorities have ordered evacuations in Manhattan. Five people died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and three were killed in Virginia due to falling trees, emergency officials said. In addition, a 55-year-old male surfer died around noon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, said Capt. Tamara Marris, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol.

As of 11 p.m., Irene was 70 miles south-southwest of Ocean City, Maryland, moving north-northeast at 16 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane already had brought 10 to 14 inches of rain to much of North Carolina and was pushing a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane warnings extend up the coast to Cape Cod in Massachusetts, with tropical storm warnings issued for parts of coastal Canada. Reports of tornadoes came from several states, including Virginia and North Carolina. Ed Schaeffer, a spokesman for the Lewes, Delaware, fire department, said between 30 and 40 homes have been damaged -- five of them severely -- though there have been no injuries. "It's pretty tough, honestly," Delaware Gov. Jack Markell said of conditions Saturday night. "So far, it's still early for us and it's already hitting us pretty hard." A tornado in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, destroyed five homes and seriously damaged a business Saturday, Sheriff Darryl Liverman told CNN affiliate WITN. Vance County authorities published photos of a home damaged when a tree fell on it and crashed through a bedroom ceiling. It was unclear if anyone was injured. The National Weather Service issued tornado watches -- indicating favorable conditions for a tornado to form, even when one hasn't been reported yet -- through Sunday morning for several areas, including New Jersey and New York City. U.S. Coast Guard Adm. William Lee, who tracked the storm by air, said he believed Saturday night the worst fears for Irene had not yet come to fruition. "All in all, the damage wasn't nearly as bad as we expected," Lee told CNN. "I've been through several hurricanes and, in comparison to ones like Frederick, Andrew and Hugo, this one (has had) significantly less damage." As it passed through North Carolina, Irene ripped off roofs and caused other damage to homes and businesses in Hyde and Jones counties, toppled trees that blocked roads and brought down power lines statewide, according to the state emergency management division. "We're not seeing catastrophic damage, but there is massive flooding near the coast in some places," Brad Nieman of the state's emergency management division said Saturday evening. In Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina -- where a hotel facade, for instance, ripped away and fell into the ocean -- police and public works crews stopped responding to calls because of adverse conditions, the state emergency management division reported. More than half a million people in North Carolina had lost power as of 7 p.m. Saturday, and 5,000 people huddled overnight in 60 shelters around the state, said Brad Neiman from the state's emergency management division. "We're not seeing catastrophic damage, but there is massive flooding near the coast," Neiman said. "A lot we will figure out at first light (Sunday)." Authorities in communities across North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland announced curfews. Some banned the sale of alcohol. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter declared a state of emergency, telling residents to be prepared to go without power for up to two weeks. Boston has joined New York, New Jersey and the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore in suspending all transit service, with no subway and bus service on Sunday. And the Philadelphia International Airport will remain closed until at least 4 p.m. Sunday, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. In Virginia, more than 600,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said. Officials warned people to be prepared to be without power for up to a week.

In Newport News, Nate Morris -- a student at Christopher Newport University, about a mile from the ocean -- said he noticed numerous trees and power lines down. "There were times when you'd walk around or be in the house, and you couldn't hear anything because of the wind and rain," Morris told CNN on Saturday night. "And it sounds it like it will be a very hard night, too." More than 1 million people on the Jersey shore had joined untold numbers of others from the Carolinas to New England in moving inland or to higher ground, away from the storm's worst impacts, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said. Those who remained behind in communities where the storm has yet to hit are making a mistake believing that the storm is too weak to do any damage, said Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator. "Some of our most devastating floods have occurred in tropical storms," he said. The hold-outs included 92 residents of Atlantic City high-rises, many of them elderly, who refused pleas from Christie and others to get a free ride out of the danger zone. Mayor Lorenzo T. Langford told CNN on Saturday night that 94 of those inside had responded to the latest call by authorities to get out. "We've made three sweeps, the most recent sweep probably was the last one," Langford said, adding that about 90% of the city's residents had evacuated. "We've admonished them to leave when they could." In New York -- where the city ordered the unprecedented evacuation of 370,000 people from low-lying areas on Friday-- even residents who aren't being ordered to leave could face an arduous few days following Irene's tour of the city. The city's transit system, shut down Saturday, may not be fully running again until Monday at the earliest, high-rise buildings are being instructed to turn off elevators and utility ConEd may have to cut power to Manhattan, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. "This is a storm where, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it can be fatal," he warned.CNN's Chris Boyette, Jeanne Meserve, Chris Lawrence, Greg Botelho, Jason Carroll, David Mattingly, John Zarrella, Kimberly Segal, Sarah Hoye, Kristina Sgueglia, Rafael Romo, Eden Pontz and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.

Mideast peace starts with talking to Iran
By Gary Sick, Special to CNN
updated 3:36 AM EST, Fri November 16, 2012
British EU official Catherine Ashton, front left, walks with Iraq's Hoshyar Zebari to talks between the P5+1 and Iran.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Gary Sick: Mideast issues are all bound up together, impossible to disentangle
Syria, Iran, Israel, the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia: All are intertwined politically
Obama's first step must be to deal with Iran, he says, accepting compromise essential
Sick: Iran deal would cut threat of war, help in Syria, lesson risk of nuclear proliferation in region
Editor's note: Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and he was the principal White House aide for Iran during the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis. Sick is a senior research scholar and adjunct professor of international affairs at Columbia University, a member of the board of Human Rights Watch in New York and founding chair of its advisory committee on the Middle East and North Africa.
(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is getting a lot of free advice. Here's a question, not an answer: With every issue in the Middle East intertwined with every other, like a giant bowl of spaghetti, where do you begin?
In reality, no matter where you begin in the Middle East, each strand connects to almost every other:
Syria? Immediately you must think of the Turks who are harboring refugees and fighters just across the border, and Syrian Kurds, who are beginning to harbor thoughts of autonomy and are increasing contacts with their ethnic brothers in Iraq and Turkey.
Gary Sick
Iran, of course, is aiding the beleaguered Bashar al-Assad but also trying to organize an exit strategy; Saudi Arabia and Qatar are pouring money and arms into the country with the sole purpose of cracking the Syria-Iran entente; Iraq fears that a Sunni takeover in Syria will revitalize its own restless Sunnis.

The Palestinian issue? No need to elaborate. That is tangled up with everything in the Middle East.
The Arab awakening? The policies you adopt with the emerging Islamist governments will affect every strand you touch in the region, from relations with Israel to the Arab states in the Persian Gulf that are terrified of sweeping change.

The president will not have the luxury of choosing a single issue and ignoring or postponing all the others. The whole Middle East has a habit of intruding, and policy choices will have to be made about each of the major issues, even if it is not convenient.
Still, in plotting a second term, the president must establish some priorities. Trying to do everything at once is not only bad strategy, it is a certain recipe for failure across the board.
A point of entry: Possibly the most promising strand to pull when trying to unravel the Mideast problem is the Iranian dilemma. When Obama came into office four years ago, he courageously promised to engage Iranian leaders. He made a genuine attempt, but he quickly pulled back in the face of Iran's brutal suppression of a civil uprising, Israeli demands for an early deadline on the nuclear issue and the fact that he had a lot on his domestic plate. Trita Parsi evocatively describes that episode in the book "A Single Roll of the Dice."
There was no staying power. Instead, the United States reverted to its default position of sanctions while maintaining the framework for serious negotiations with Iran as part of the so-called P5+1 -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia) plus one (Germany).
The sanctions did their job. Iran has gladly accepted the invitation of the P5+1 to return to the negotiating table. However, in the run-up to the presidential election, the United States was unwilling to put a meaningful offer on the table, and the negotiating track languished in a kind of limbo.
The value of sanctions: Sanctions have two useful purposes. One is to persuade Iran to return to the negotiating table. That has happened. The other is to give the sanctioning party something to bargain away in return for concessions.
Up to this point, the United States has been unwilling to offer significant sanctions relief in return for significant concessions from Iran. Sanctions have assumed a life of their own and are gradually becoming politically untouchable. If that remains true, then there is no prospect of serious negotiations.
There is another use of sanctions -- to punish a party you don't like and potentially coerce them into submission or collapse. The current sanctions regime is taking on that coloration, even if it is seldom discussed as such.
The record of sanctions in producing abject surrender or regime change is not promising. Instead, the sanctions typically hurt the average citizen, while leaders escape most of the effects and adopt a defiant posture, blaming their own failings on outside interference. This is beginning to happen in Iran today.
Vicious assaults on the well-being of a country's population can produce popular bitterness and hostility against the "enemy" that can last for generations.
The shape of an agenda: As with many long-standing disputes, the broad outlines of a settlement are well-known to the parties. What is lacking is the political judgment by both sides that now is the moment to proceed with a deal that will require mutual compromise.
The United States and its allies will have to accept a measure of Iranian domestic enrichment of uranium. Iran will have to accept limits on its entire nuclear infrastructure, subject to intrusive inspections and monitoring. Iran will need to document the history of its nuclear program, and the West will need to remove sanctions. All of this must happen in a step-by-step process with safeguards and verifications at each stage.
There is nothing easy about it. The Iranians are known as obstinate and often infuriating negotiators. The United States is not known for its patience, and it can be clumsy and ponderous as it attempts to please multiple constituencies at the same time. Iran is certain to face strong objections from its hardliners, and the same will apply in the United States.
The hardliners on both sides, who regard another Middle East war as an acceptable option, reinforce each other and impede efforts to find mutually acceptable compromises. Israel and the U.S. Congress will try to impose impractically tight deadlines. And events in the region, such as the recent case of Iranian aircraft firing on a U.S. surveillance drone, can sabotage negotiations.
The Arab states of the Gulf will be intensely suspicious of any hint of a secret deal between the United States and Iran. They remember America's strategic reliance on the shah, the Reagan administration's covert sale of weapons to Iran in the mid-1980s and America's installation of a Shia government in Iraq. They (and Israel) will have to be persuaded that any accommodation with Iran is not at their expense.
Private and public negotiations: The starting point must be private U.S.-Iran discussions, leading to an agreed agenda. Both sides have recently hinted that such talks are under consideration, and reactions from the European Union, Russia and even the American people have been undismayed, even openly supportive.
The choice of representatives and venues is less important than confidence that delegates credibly reflect the view of their leaders. Experience suggests that an agreed agenda is more likely to emerge from bilateral discussions outside the glare of publicity. If that is accomplished, then the actual negotiations could be carried out within the existing P5+1 framework.
Even a preliminary agreement -- establishing a mutually acceptable process with a defined end point -- would help to unravel some of the tangles of Middle East issues.
The threat of a new war in the Middle East would be reduced. The possibility of getting Iranian cooperation on Syria would be improved. The threat of nuclear proliferation in the region would be tamped down at least temporarily. And the multiple flash points in the Gulf could potentially cool down, leaving opportunities for more constructive initiatives.
The history of U.S.-Iran relations is a story of relentless hostility and serial missed opportunities. Chances for genuine progress come along scarcely once in a decade.
So, Mr. President, here is one more piece of free advice: The present constellation of circumstances with Iran is probably the best you're going to get. Don't let it pass.

Flirting 101: Coaches teach daters to cozy up
By Shanon Cook, CNN
updated 4:49 PM EST, Wed February 13, 2013
Flirting is a skill that some people have to put effort into learning.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dating coach Tracey Steinberg takes hopeful singles out on the town to learn how to flirt
For people who overthink the process, flirting can be an exercise in paralyzing failure
Steinberg advises clients to keep things light and breezy but maintain good eye contact
Clients say they've gained tools to talk to strangers regardless of the circumstances
Editor's note: Shanon Cook is an entertainment contributor for CNN and has interviewed Peter Gabriel, Sting, Britney Spears, Kanye West, Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys and Yo-Yo Ma. Cook grew up in Australia and now lives in New York with her husband and daughter. Follow her on Twitter @ShanonCook.
(CNN) -- My name is Shanon and I'm a flirtaholic. As you're reading this, I'm probably flirting with some poor unsuspecting male -- a doorman, my doctor, a rock star.
My come-hither-ness was first called out when I was 22. It was a gloriously sunny day in Sydney and the male friend I was having coffee with leaned across the table and said, "You know, you're an insatiable flirt."
"That's ridiculous!" I scoffed while batting my eyelids at him.
Flirting is a skill that might come quite naturally (perhaps cringe-inducingly) to some, yet a woman I recently met at a friend's party introduced me to the idea that many people find flirting as terrifying as swimming with sharks. Her name was Tracey Steinberg; she smiled an awful lot, and she told me she was a dating coach who hosts "flirting parties" in Manhattan.
Shanon Cook
"Go on," I said with a raised eyebrow.
Many of her clients don't know the first thing about breaking the ice with strangers they're attracted to, she explained. They freeze, go mute, look at the floor or blurt out a depressing fact about hurricane devastation.
Steinberg arranges outings for groups of five or so adults with the desire to boost their courting potential, takes them to a busy bar, gives them a pep talk, then forces them to approach attractive strangers and, well, get cutesy.
This sounded like something I had to witness firsthand. And it made me wonder, if people are willing to pay experts to teach them to flirt ($95 for one of Steinberg's two-hour flirting parties), what does that say about the role flirting plays in our lives? Is it just a bonus skill that's nice to have, like being able to roll sushi or pole dance? Or is it a necessary function of bringing soul mates together?
The lost art of offline dating
According to Fran Greene, a dating and flirting coach and author of "The Flirting Bible," it's a bit of both.
Stay in touch!
Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. "Like" us on Facebook and have your say! Get the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.
"Flirting allows you to meet someone you would ordinarily be too timid or terrified to approach," she says. "No matter what the outcome, there is a sense of magic that occurs when you flirt. The more you flirt, the better you get and the more people you will bring into your life."
Sadly, when I rocked up to Steinberg's flirting party in my flirtiest maternity dress, bitterly cold New York temperatures had kept all but one of her clients away. But this was good news for the single lady, Becky, because with Steinberg all to herself, she'd get more bang for her buck (so to speak.)
Over drinks at an upscale pool hall, Steinberg prepped Becky with a recap of the do's and don'ts: "It's about having a natural smile, soft eyes"... "make yourself available and approachable"... "be complimentary' ... "maintaining eye contact is key"... "don't be too quick to dismiss him if he says something weird"..."keep the conversation light and breezy."
Becky, an artist in her 30s, nodded slowly, hanging on every word as though she was learning of a secret plot to end the world. Becky's main obstacle to being a pro flirter, Steinberg told me later, is her brain.
"The people I work with tend to be very accomplished in their career, very intellectual," she said. "But it really gets in the way of flirting because flirting is with your body, it's not with your mind."
Perhaps to emphasize that last point, Steinberg put Becky through one final exercise before we got to the practical portion of the evening:
"Who is your ideal hot guy?" she asked.
"Hmmm. Daniel Craig," Becky said.
"And what would you say to him if he was standing right over there?"
After a couple of dud suggestions from Becky, Steinberg chimed in and threw out a bunch of icebreakers that might snag the attention of our current James Bond.
"OK, let's go meet some guys!" Steinberg said, all gung-ho.
Not satisfied there were enough men at the pool hall, she led us across the street to another bar to find Daniel Craig.
To be clear, these parties are not about hooking up. Nor are they about finding your future husband or wife. They're all about getting practice.
Nick is a journalist in his late 40s living in New York who found the hands-on approach useful when he attended a flirting party just for dudes a couple of weeks ago.
"Basically, I'm a successful guy," he said. "But the notion of walking up to a woman I've never met and striking up a conversation is paralyzing. Imagine the terror you might feel if you had to give a speech to 10,000 people while wearing only your underwear. That terrifies me less than approaching a woman in public."
Gosh. What helps, Nick has learned, is to get that large pesky brain out of the way.
How technology has changed romance
"Don't think too much," he says. "I can be paralyzed by, say, the fact that I don't have the perfect opening line. ... Tracey preaches not thinking at that moment. You've just got to plunge in and say something."
To be honest, I wasn't sure Becky had the mustard to talk to a single guy in the bar, and I was starting to feel nervous for her. But when she emerged from the restroom, she'd taken her long dark hair out of her ponytail, a definite step in the sexy direction. And with Steinberg at her side goading her, she suddenly picked a target and just went for it. (This was actually Becky's second flirting party, so she knew the drill.)
"Are you all here for a group function?" she asked a man in his 40s who took an instant liking to her. They chatted for a while until Becky noticed he was wearing a wedding ring and gently extracted herself from the situation.
Later, as Becky made her way to the bar, flashing a warm smile was all it took for a tall, handsome guy sipping a glass of red wine to ask her which sport she was watching (we were in a sports bar, because that's where you go when you're looking for bountiful testosterone).
The conversation that followed was promising. The handsome dude was from Nigeria, and Becky came up with all sorts of questions to keep things flowing. Unfortunately, one of those questions was "Do you have a green card?" which as Steinberg pointed out later, didn't exactly fall under the "light and breezy" category.
But it didn't matter. Nor did it matter that she'd be going home without a phone number or a date planned. Becky had achieved her goal; she'd put aside fear of rejection, fear of failure, fear of being boring, fear of being too short, tall, old, young, whatever, and had broken the ice with complete strangers.
"I'm really proud of you," Steinberg said sincerely after a quick debrief. "You did really well tonight."
Becky looked exhausted but somewhat triumphant as she waved goodbye and headed for the subway.
Sure, flirting experts will tell you it's possible to go from having no flirting skills whatsoever to becoming a flirting genius. Greene says she's transformed people in 30 days. Steinberg contends that everyone has the ability to flirt; it's just a matter of accessing that ability and putting some muscle behind it.
Dora, a busy finance executive in her mid-40s, rated her flirting skills as one out of 10 before she started flexing her flirtimus to the maximus.
"It was not something that I thought was important in meeting single men in my age range," she said. "My thinking was if someone is interested they will speak to you. Not the case, as I have learned. Men need to know you are open, friendly and approachable.
"For me it was a six-month process of learning this new skill and putting it to work in my life. But once you learn, you realize how easy and fun it really is. You have nothing to lose and all to gain. I can walk into a restaurant, a bar, a dry cleaners, a coffee shop and easily strike up a conversation with a potential adorable single guy."
Scoff all you like at the idea of a dating coaches and the like. But at the end of the day, what they're offering -- for a fee, granted -- is getting you one, two or three steps closer to life's most potent and enduring resource: love.

Benghazi attack timeline
See show times »
From CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront"
updated 1:21 PM EDT, Wed August 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ambassador Christopher Stevens was in Benghazi to talk to officials about weapons stockpiles
Stevens and information officer holed up in safe room in compound
Two Navy SEALs were killed while fighting off attack on other Americans in Benghazi
(CNN) -- September 11, 2012, in America was a day of solemn remembrance. In Libya, it was a day of violence that ended with four Americans killed, starting a debate over whether the Obama administration should have better protected them and whether it tried to cover its tracks after the debacle.
Ambassador Christopher Stevens was in Benghazi that day to meet with officials over the hunt for ousted dictator Moammar Ghadafi's weapons stockpiles and to open a cultural center. Here is how events played out that day (all times local):
9:40 p.m.: Gunfire is heard outside the Benghazi diplomatic mission, then a loud explosion. Dozens of armed militiamen charge the main gate and set fire to a barracks building as they make for the ambassador's residence.
CORRECTION
An earlier version of this story misidentified Gregory Hicks, who was deputy mission chief at the time of the attacks.
10 p.m.: Attackers breach the mission walls and make for the ambassador's residence. Stevens and information officer Sean Smith run to a safe room with one security agent.
An alert is sent to the CIA security team at an annex about a mile away, the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. Stevens calls deputy mission chief Gregory Hicks at the embassy and tells him, "Greg, we're under attack."
Exclusive: Dozens of CIA operatives on the ground during Benghazi attack
Return to Benghazi: Embassy under attack
Return to Benghazi: A city divided
Return to Benghazi: Questions unanswered
10:30 p.m.: Stevens and Smith have taken refuge behind a fortified door with heavy metal bars that keeps the attackers from breaking in, but they set fire to the villa with diesel fuel. Within minutes, Stevens and Smith are overwhelmed by smoke.
At about the same time, six U.S. security agents leave the CIA annex for the main building. They and 16 Libyan security guards regain control over the compound and start searching for Stevens and Smith.
Shortly after 11 p.m.: A U.S. surveillance drone arrives over Benghazi. Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey meet with President Barack Obama.
12:07 a.m., September 12: The State Department sends an e-mail to the White House, the Pentagon and the FBI indicating the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Sharia claimed credit for the attack.
Issa demands more State Department documents on Benghazi
1:15 a.m.: A rescue team from Tripoli arrives in Benghazi. About 30 Americans have been rescued from the consulate building and are holed up with the Stevens at the CIA annex.
2 a.m.: Hicks informs Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that they need to evacuate all Americans from Benghazi. At about the same time, an eyewitness captures on video Stevens being pulled from the smoke-filled building.
4 a.m.: The attackers launch a full-on assault against the annex, dropping mortars on the roof. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods are killed in the attack.
10 a.m.: The bodies of Stevens, Smith, Doherty and Woods are put on the last plane out of Benghazi.

Next available flight: Christmas Day
Getting back to "getting there" ... we're still going nowhere, at least for the moment.Five of us from CNN are here in Dallas. We can't get on any commercial flight to Denver, Ft. Collins, or anywhere near where the big snowstorm has struck. We were all set to charter a plane yesterday after our commercial flight was cancelled, but the weather made it too unsafe to fly. Airports in the snowy region are all closed.Adding to our problems, when planes do start to take off, they have a whole lot of back-up, so getting seats seems impossible. Our travel agents told us we could make a reservation for Christmas Day. Honestly.How about driving? The interstates going to eastern Colorado are closed.As I said in my last post, a big part of covering the news is just getting there. And this is one of those weird weather stories where, like a lot of other people, we are stranded.10:44 a.m. update: We're getting steady phone calls and messages from CNN staff in charge of planning and logistics, folks who are wracking their brains trying to figure out how to get us into Denver.It's reminding me of one of my Dr. Seuss favorites: "Green Eggs and Ham." Pardon the paraphrasing: Would you, could you, on a plane?Would you, could you, on a train?I could not, would not, on a plane!I'm stuck right now. It is just insane!OK, maybe I'm no replacement for the great author of children's books.But I am eating eggs at the Dallas Marriott.
Posted By Keith Oppenheim, CNN Correspondent: 9:53 AM ET 56 Comments Hey Keith;I'm enjoying your blog updates sitting here in a completely snowless Ontario Canada..lol I'll bet you're very thankful for that Blackberry at a time like this, it must be awfully frustrating trying so hard to get somewhere and being blocked (pardon the pun) at every turn.Keep us updated and whatever you do, don't forget to call Mom!
Posted By Bev Ontario Canada : 10:19 AM ET
You should take this opportunity and visit Dallas, How is it? I have never been there.Anyway thanks for the confession about you calling your mum so often; I have always felt stupid calling her at least twice a day. Hum, my day is never as carzy as yours though.
Posted By Gabrielle, Toulouse, France : 10:30 AM ET
Hi Keith,If I were you I would go home. You tried. CNN has at least one reporter in place in Denver. I saw a report on 360 last night from a cold reporter standing in the snow on a deserted street. It looks like it will fall to that lone reporter to give us the news. We flew through Denver in early December right after the last big storm and I can only imagine what it is like now. Christmas is an awful time to try and fly anywhere. We have stopped traveling by air during the holidays (unless we go west to Hawaii) for that very reason. There is the weather and the crowds to contend with. My prayers are with those stuck in airports trying to get home for the holidays. I hope they make it.Merry Christmas.
Posted By Charlotte D, Stockton CA : 10:37 AM ET
Just because I-70 & I-25 are closed, there are back routes to drive in on. In February 2003 they had a similar storm. Balconies and roofs were collapsing under the weight of the snow. Schools and businesses were closed. We were stranded in Denver trying to get back to Dallas. We rented a car and once we were out of Denver had little problem with the roads.BTW, Anderson's reaction last night after the Trump O'Donnell package ran was the best 3 seconds of silence in television history. His expression was priceless (made me wonder why he ran the story to begin with but priceless none-the-less).
Posted By Fran, Addison, TX : 10:40 AM ET
No where in any of these articles is Amtrak mentioned. The overnight train from Chicago will arrive in Denver this morning, a couple of hours late, but it WILL arrive unlike ALL the airplanes and busses that aren't running at all.
Posted By Doug Kerr, Healdsburg, CA : 10:41 AM ET
I don't know... it seems selfish to me to try and get plane tickets while so many are trying to get home for the holidays... What's the big deal about a snow storm anyway?? What are you going to report?? Oh, roads are closed, cars are stranded, electricity is out?? No big surprises there. Just seems like a waste of time to me.
Posted By Christine, Toms River, NJ : 10:42 AM ET
I saw the pictures on cnn.com. I wish everybody a safe trip how ever you get there, not only the reporters. We are used to those kinds of weather here so I know how dangerous it can be. We have no snow, we are on the grass. You could send us truckloads of snow. Be careful all of you. Safe trips. Have a wonderful holiday seasons.Joanne RanzellLaval QuebecP.S. I think mother nature is having a fit or someone switch the map around!!!
Posted By Joanne Ranzell Laval Quebec : 10:50 AM ET
You should check out Dallas - and even maybe head west to downtown Fort Worth -- both are great cities -- Dallas, you can see where Kennedy was shot - and Fort Worth has some of the best art museums in the country. Downtown Fort Worth is also VERY nice..
Posted By Brenda, You Guessed It - Fort Worth : 10:50 AM ET
If you have time to kill, head to downtown Ft Worth and take in the Christmas decorations.Might as well take Amtrak or rent a car back to CO. You can make the trip in 1 day as opposed to 4 days waiting for a flight. I doubt that there will be any standby seating available on any flight before Christmas Day.
Posted By John Bedford, TX : 11:02 AM ET
I empathize with your current travel situation, but wonder if all options have been explored. In the mid-1980's I used to drive the Anchorage to Delta Junction route in Alaska...by myself...female...and in January! I have already checked the vehicle rentals available at DFW airport and several provide larger SUV's (Naviators etc.) which may at least get you closer to the action. I realize the interstates are closed, but there are other routes. Of course I don't propose you take chances that would make "the story" instead of just covering it....but I have confidence in your abilities! Get a vehicle with a navigation system...call local postmasters in towns you are trying to get to next...I have found them invaluable for information on passible roads in poor conditions...and take lots of shovels, kitty litter (for ice), survival gear for several days...and GET THAT STORY!!!...The rest of us would like to hear a good CNN adventure story.

What is there to report? Lots of snow, airport closed, travelers stranded, holiday plans awry. Unless Denver is home to your news team, why don't you all just go home for Christmas.
Posted By Ruth, Portland, OR : 11:04 AM ET
As long as you're stuck here, you should check out Dallas! Go to guidelive.com (ran by our newspaper) and see what all there is to do.
Posted By Jennifer, Dallas, Texas : 11:05 AM ET
My father was flying home yesterday from Cairo, Egypt to Colorado Springs. Although he got stuck in Minneapolis, MN last night, he did get a flight out of Minneapolis to Colorado Springs this morning. He landed safely back home at 9:30 this morning in Colorado. So the Colorado Springs Airport is open and sending people through! Maybe you should fly into there! Now the next challenge is going to be getting my family from Lexington, KY to Colorado Springs for Christmas. Maybe the roads will be open by then!Have a Safe and Merry Christmas.
Posted By Sandy Lexington, KY : 11:13 AM ET
Hey, go East young man. How about a trip along the Gulf Coast? Watch out for flooding and tornados, though. Christmas 2 after the big K and R? Guess I'm just one who has lived in the snow for so long, it is just time to stay off the roads and wait for the plows to come through and close the driveway you just got shoveled.
Posted By linda, bella vista,ar : 11:23 AM ET
Whatever you all decide to do, just don't become "the story" instead of the ones reporting it.

I was one of those trapped on a bus in Boulder yesterday. I rode the bus to work into Boulder, not believing the blizzard predictions, but not wanting to drive in the snow anyway. They were predicting two, three feet of snow, but it was sunny and bright the day before, and it was hard to imagine a blizzard.They closed Boulder City offices about 11:00, so our office closed. The snow was beautiful, it was like walking ina snow globe down the pedestrian mall in Boulder to catch my bus. Everyone was in a festive mood. We love the snow in Colorado. There is never enough, really.The first bus I got on got m almost home, then got turned back because another bus in front of us couldn't make it up a hill and was sideways in the road. They turned around, no small feat, and took us back to the terminal. The next bus got stuck in the snow, and there were so many buses stuck, and too few two trucks. I waited on the bus until it got dark, and then called a friend who came to the bus and rescued me and as many other bus riders as could fit in her SUV. I got home about 7:00, had to wade through waste-high snow that had drifted on my road. I was so happy to be home, and I didn't miss AC360, so that was a bonus. We don't get hurricanes, many tornados, but Mother Nature surprises us with a blizzard every so often.

You guys can come and spend Christmas Eve with my family in Lewisville, Texas, just north of Dallas. We have plenty of food, good Southern, stick to your ribs cooking!!!!
Posted By Leslie Ripple, Lewisville, Texas : 11:32 AM ET
Forgive my ignorance please. Do you guys live in Colorado? Are you trying to get home to your families? If so, Im so sorry for you, BUT, please dont take any chances - Your families would rather have safe then to risk anything. Merry Christmas to you all!
Posted By Mary Hohnke, Michigan City, Indiana : 11:34 AM ET
You guys should just take feeds from the local affiliates - they HAVE to be there. Maybe you'll discover your next big news star?
Posted By Arachnae, Sterling VA : 11:38 AM ET
Hey, I know some people have mentioned the CO Springs airport is open- however, once you get there, you're stuck there! My friends in CO are all stranded because I-25 is closed. Some of them got to the airport, live in the Springs, but can't even get home because too many roads are closed or not plowed!!! So if you do fly into the Springs, good luck- you'll be there for awhile!!
Posted By Elizabeth, Loudoun, Virginia : 11:42 AM ET
The Dr. Seuss "poem" made me laugh out loud. It's nice to know you still have humor. Keep up the good work, stay safe. It's times like this when you wonder why they can't just use "stock" footage and be done with it. ha!
Posted By Marcy, Mobile, AL : 11:43 AM ET
If you Charter a flight you can fly into Fremont County Airport and Drive to Denver. I think we are the only Colorado Town that recieved NO Snow.Best of Luck.Bill DeBekker
Posted By Canon City, CO : 11:50 AM ET
Why don't you come to mid-Maine? It's in the low 50's, sunny, no snow and just wonderful!! Lots of food, family, and Christmas spirit(s). Merry Christmas!! We are big CNN fans.

As I am sitting here in Sunny San Diego waiting for my flight to San Francisco, I consider myself one of the lucky travelers. Even if the plane is delayed, I know I will get home one way or another. I wish the best of luck to all those flying across the country in this weather.
Posted By Kelly, San Francisco : 11:58 AM ET
Why do You need to get to Denver...It is snowing, airports are closed, and roads are closed. I think it is a waste of time, money and energy to deploy your team there. Try covering some real news.
Posted By Lee Dowdy, Aiken SC : 12:01 PM ET
This reminds me of Steve Martin in the movie "Trains,Planes and Autombiles" when he and John Candy where trying to get home for Thanksgiving. A good movie to watch while stranded in Denver.

Posted By Lorie Ann, Buellton, Calif. : 12:26 PM ET
Its a snow storm, who cares, Guess what there will be another snowstorm and an airport will shut down.. This is a non-story. Keep working on real stories, like why President Bush is still office?
Posted By Big D, detroit MI : 12:26 PM ET
I think what you are going through right now to get to Denver is the actual story here. Many other travelers are facing the same problems as you. You should maybe try to do some live shots from wherever you are waiting to show what you have been trying to do to get to your destination.I hope you and the others travel safe.
Posted By Despina, Charlotte, NC : 12:27 PM ET
you could fly DIRECT to Vail (airport code) with no problems and then drive to Denver (from Vail driving West to east which isnt closed, to Denver. My family flew out of DFW direct to Vail this morning with NO PROBLEMS or delays.
Posted By Debbie, Dallas, TX : 12:34 PM ET
Hi Keith, I know someone in Longview, Texas, east of Dallas on I-20, who is supposed to fly back to Denver this evening. Thanks for the update. Longview is in East Texas, in the Piney Woods, that are beatiful . . . most things there are still green. Rent a car and get the staff out of Dallas while you're waiting . . .there is much to see and enjoy! There is snow on the ground where I live. I wish I were in Longview!
Posted By Terry, in Cozad, Nebraska : 12:38 PM ET
Why do you have to get to Denver? The local stations are already there, and can provide the American public with great coverage.
Posted By Virginia/Minneapolis/MN : 12:42 PM ET
I'm sitting here in downtown Denver. While this was a monumental blizzard, it's hardly newsworthy enough to risk flying or driving in for. This is Denver. It doesn't snow here as much as some people may think but these blizzards do happen. I'm a 3rd generation native of this wonderful city and knowing schizophrenic Denver weather as I do...it'll all be gone and melted under sunny warm skies before you know it.
Posted By Thomas, Denver, CO : 12:44 PM ET
This is not news. This is better suited for a journal or diary. Based on the responses of the other posters, I guess this is what 'News' has become.Pity...

Hey Keith~Welcome to Texas! If you guys get really bored you can come to my house in Nacogdoches for Christmas. No snowstorms here but I promise you won't get bored at my house and we would love to have ya'll. Do you like mexican food and margaritas? ; )

Hello from snowy Colorado. I live in Littleton and it is still snowing. I have snow drifts in the cul-de-sac about 5 feet high. I have 4-wheel drive, but it's parked in my garage with no hope of getting out. My puppy is thrilled no end and is spending her day disappearing in the drifts in the back yard. I can't see my patio furniture. I work in Downtown Denver and left about noon yesterday. I brought work home with me but can't get much done because people I have to call are not at work. I'm supposed to fly out of Denver International on Saturday to go visit my family on Long Island for the holidays and I'm getting nervous. I have neither seen nor heard a snow plow all day and since I live in a cul-de-sac, it's not likely one will be through here at all. So, we're on our own. I'm enjoying the time home with my husband, my sister, my cat and our new puppy. I'll try to keep you posted, but I'm off to settle in for a long winter's nap. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!
Posted By Marilyn, Littleton, Colorado : 1:09 PM ET
Colorado Springs airport is open now, but I don't think you can get to Denver yet. The highways are impassable. Once they do open, they will require chains and vehicles will move in caravans.
Posted By Kris, Colorado Springs, CO : 1:23 PM ET
Hi Keith,Just flew back to Seattle (the new "Windy City") from Atlanta on Tuesday and my first thought when booking a ticket....do NOT have a stop over in Denver! Make the best of a bad situation...enjoy some good Texas BBQ. Merry Christmas!
Posted By Cathy,Seattle, WA : 1:24 PM ET
It ain't that excitin'. I'm her in CO Springs and although it was pretty scary yesterday when I was trying to get home, it isn't that exciting for anybody else. I doubt the rest of the nation really cares we got a bunch o' snow here.
Posted By Jaque, Colorado Springs, CO : 1:36 PM ET
Hi Keith!While you are waiting, let me tell you about the Blizzard of 1978. The whole country was shut down. I was in college and finals were canceled but you couldn't leave to go home. But some how a few, well, kegs were are able to get through. The year 1978 was also the year where the US had an "imaginary" energy crisis. Luckily, the crisis hit during spring break and I was able to stay in Fort Lauderdale an extra week. Oh, yes, the memories of blizzards. Sorry no Denver. Have you called your mother lately?Moms are always accurate. That is because I am one.
Posted By Sharon D., Indianapolis, IN : 1:49 PM ET
Hey Keith: Loved the Dr. Seuss metaphor but don't quit your day job! Sorry to hear you didn't get to Denver yet. I disagree with most of the bloggers here who don't think there is a story in Denver. They got hit with a lot of snow, roads/airports are closed, etc. Are there electricity issues, food shortages, health issues, accidents? Good luck and keep giving us updates on the blog!
Posted By Jolene, St. Joseph, MI : 2:05 PM ET
Greeting from Colorado Springs, CO! Most everyone is snowed in down here except for those of us who live on the West Side (of downtown Springs)--somehow we seem to luck out as the snow often just misses our little pocket. All of the schools are closed; I'm a high school teacher in D-11. Our principal made a plan on Monday about final exams. So we did get through some exams on Tuesday, but the rest have been postponed until we return from break. Good call from our principal and the district!The northern part of Colorado Springs and those out east are stuck in large snowdrifts; the highways and interstates are closed. They even cancelled the mail. I have to fly out of DIA to Kansas City tomorrow and imagine that the traffic into Denver, as well as the masses of stranded travelers at DIA, is not going to make for a very pleasant Friday afternoon. The worst part about living here is driving: we have only a four lane highway from Colorado Springs to Denver (about 75 miles) which causes many people to drive impatiently and foolishly.Happy Festivus and a Merry New Year!
Posted By CJ , Colorado Springs, CO : 2:06 PM ET
Nice to know I am stuck in Dallas with good company. However I am just trying to make it home after what was suppose to be a one day business trip. Glad I called United bright and early yesterday morning - got a seat on an 8:18 a.m. Saturday. Just in case, I went shopping last night at my husband's suggestion, making sure to wrap some of my purchase to open Monday just in case.
Posted By Shawn, Bailey, Colorado : 2:07 PM ET
Hi Keith-you should stay in Texas. You have a better chance of seeing snow there than in Chicago! Hope you all get home safely for Christmas.

Keith,It's currently 80 degrees here in Tampa. But I don't want to rub it in. Have you considered leasing a dog sled team? We used them all the time to get to remote locations in Alaska. Just a thought from a former FAA employee.
Posted By Paul Proue Dade City, FL : 2:26 PM ET
If your travel agent "gurus" find you a way into CO Springs before Christmas Day, see if they can also find our son a way out of the Springs and into Detroit before Christmas. He was supposed to fly out yesterday morning, but alas like everyone else he doesn't have to dream of a White Christmas. But he WAS hoping to get home before the big day arrived. Good luck and safe journey to all.

At least you're at a nice hotel. Maybe you can get your mother something nice for Christmas!

I loved that book,"Green Eggs and Ham". Now on a serious note, their is only a few more days till Christmas. Do you really feel like working? Have you read that book Humpty Dumpty? Are you just walking on that wall real slowly. Merry Xmas and I hope you make it to where every you really want to go. I hear the Trump Vodka is really good with Egg Nog while wait!
Posted By Claude Calgary AB Canada : 4:32 PM ET
When in doubt, pull a technique from the Daily Show, just get a great picture of the snow at the airport and stand in front of it reporting as if you're really there, we'll never know and it will look like you all over the story! Merry Christmas

My boss flew out to Southern Califonia on Monday, with intentions on returning to Denver on Wednesday afternoon. While he's not thrilled to be stranged, he's at least in sunny So Cal. He's managed to find a seat on a late flight Friday evening, hopefully he can make it home to be with his family.

These issues are one of many hoilday hang-ups the keep us focused on whats important around this time: "Getting there" and enjoying ones self. My perspective of electronics and policy lead me to assume that connections in no particular order will come out right as this is an even year, 2006.

CNN - The Netly News - Hey, Buddy, Can You Spare Some Cycles? - Sept. 24, 1997
Hey, buddy, can you spare some cycles?
From Netly News Writer Stan Gunn
How much do you really use your computer? Oh sure, you might spend eight hours a day pecking away at the Great American Novel. Maybe you work 60-hour weeks preparing budget reports. You may even be a member of some hotshot Quake clan, fragging your enemies every night. Point is, though, for the majority of the time, your computer, a device that represents more processing power than existed on the planet 30 years ago, is being wasted. Not to invoke the Puritan work ethic, but do you realize your computer is spending the greater part of its day drawing 3-D pipes to provide you with screensaver eye candy?
Why not harness that extra power for the greater good? Why not use it to search for intelligent life on other planets?
Before we get to the voices from outer space, let's talk about Mersenne primes for a minute. Bear with me. Like other primes, a Mersenne prime number can be divided only by itself and by 1. What makes a Mersenne prime special is its structure -- Mersenne primes all follow the format 2^x-1. What makes them even more special is that there are only 36 of them known, and before August 24, 1997, there were just 35. Gordon Spence found the current world record, the longest Mersenne prime ever found: 2^2976221-1 -- that's 895,932 digits if you write it out.
So what? A few days on a Cray and you could probably find a new one too. Except that Spence didn't find it on a Cray, he used a 100Mhz Pentium. Spence is one of the 2,000 members of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS). According to the GIMPS press release, it would have taken Spence on his own more than 940 years for his computer to find this prime number. But by throwing the PC power of all the members of GIMPS at the problem, two new Mersenne primes have been discovered in the last 10 months (number 35 was found in November 1996, also by the GIMPS team). So who makes up GIMPS? Volunteers, people just like you and me, except maybe a little more interested in mathematics.

GIMPS is just one of many projects that uses the idea of distributed computing, breaking up a problem into manageable chunks and handing out pieces over the Internet. Of course, not all distributed computing projects are as purely intellectual as GIMPS. Two groups are currently working to win one of RSA's secret-key encryption contests by harnessing the power of volunteers recruited on the Internet. If the Finland-based RC5 Project organizers win, they plan to split RSA's $10,000 reward with the user who manages to break the key. The Bovine RC5 Project will give $1,000 to the lucky person or group who finds the number, keep $1,000 to cover its own expenses, and donate the other $8,000 to Project Gutenberg.
Adam Beberg, currently pursuing his master's in computer science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, writes the client software that makes Bovine work. He finds that project participants have different motivations. "Well, there's lots of crypto people who are doing it for fun or to show the weaknesses of 56-bit encryption," he says. "Then you have the folks who are interested in distributed computing and operating systems. For a lot of the people who participate it's a team competition thing. Our servers rank each team by how many keys they've done each day and in total, so you can always see your rankings against everyone else. Finally, a lot of people just do it out of curiosity." There must be a lot of curiosity -- Beberg estimates that the computing power being aimed at the Bovine RC5 effort daily is equivalent to about 10,000 200Mhz Pentium Pro PCs.
One of Bovine's volunteers, who asked to remain nameless since he's running the RC5 cracking client on several of his company's servers, expresses a different purpose. "It reminds me of the old days of the Internet, before banner ads and spam," he says. "I hope I don't win, it would cause too many problems at work. I just like the idea of participating in this big group effort, accomplishing something none of us could do alone."
But let's get back to the aliens.
If you wouldn't know a Mersenne prime from a prime rib and could care less about breaking the latest cryptography algorithm, you can still find a worthy cause for your PC's idle moments. SETI@home, scheduled to start in the spring of 1998, will look like a screensaver as it runs on your PC. In the background, however, it will be downloading and analyzing data recorded at the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and searching for meaningful bleeps and clicks from outer space. Big Science plans SETI@home as a two-year project, whose aim is to do real science. The chief scientist, Dr. Dan Werthimer, has been involved in SETI projects for the last 17 years and designed some of the hardware that will be used to capture the data.
David Gedye, the project director for SETI@home, hopes that thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people will be willing to run the software. He summed up the project this way: "Most people are interested in the Big Questions. There may never be a general consensus on whether there is a God, and what He or She is like, but nearly as mind-boggling as the religious questions are the ones like 'Are we alone?' With this project we have at least some chance of answering that one."
And that's what distributed computing is all about -- answering the big questions and winning bragging rights to having answered them first. It's the same competitive volunteer spirit that started the Internet and the reason that Beberg wants the RC5 winnings to go to Project Gutenberg. "It's because of what they do," he said. "They digitize books and give them away for free. I like that." The Netly News updates daily on the Pathfinder network
