Bush: 'Our entire nation grieves' WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The following is a recap of President Bush's day, as recounted to CNN by a senior administration official:
8 a.m. EST
President Bush, at the Camp David retreat, receives his usual intelligence briefing.
9 a.m. EST
White House Chief of Staff Andy Card, also at Camp David, is channel surfing, flipping through TV stations, and begins watching NASA Television, awaiting the landing. He sees that NASA has lost contact with the space shuttle Columbia.
Card calls the Situation Room and then NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe but could not reach him. Card tells Bush that NASA has lost contact with the shuttle.
Bush's initial reaction is that he is deeply concerned for those on board, especially for the families. He tells Card to keep him updated as events unfold and to keep in close contact with O'Keefe.
9:15 a.m. EST
Card and O'Keefe speak. O'Keefe updates him on the situation.
Card notifies National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who is at Camp David, as well as Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers.
10:30 a.m. EST
Bush is briefed by O'Keefe by phone and decides to cut short his stay at Camp David.
12:15 p.m. EST
Bush returns to the White House via a speeding motorcade.
12:30 p.m. EST
The president has returned to the Oval Office. Soon after, he is briefed by O'Keefe by phone, who tells Bush that the families are "holding up exceptionally well ... they are a courageous group of people."
Bush tells O'Keefe that "this was a tough day for all."
12:40 p.m. EST
Bush holds a conference call with victims' families, who had assembled in a conference room at Kennedy Space Center. Bush is standing at his desk in the Oval Office.
The president's motorcade returns from Camp David to Washington.
In the conversation, which takes place over a speaker phone, Bush says, "I express my love and appreciation for all who died today. I want their loved ones to know there are millions of people praying for you.... I hope that brings some comfort to you. This was an incredibly tough day. May God Bless you all. I wish I was there to hug, cry and comfort you. God Bless you all. God Bless."
12:45 p.m. EST
Bush is briefed by advisers in the Roosevelt Room: Rice, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, and his science adviser, regarding fallen shuttle debris.
1:25 p.m. EST
Bush calls Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to offer condolences.
1:25 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. EST
Bush returns condolence calls from Mexican President Vicente Fox, French President Jacques Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Iraq is discussed in none of these calls. Between the calls, Bush prepares to address the nation.
2 p.m. EST
The president addresses the nation from the Cabinet Room at the White House. "Columbia is lost," he says, "there are no survivors."

Supreme Court rejects appeals, including Mumia Abu-Jamal'sStory Highlights Justices reject new trial for convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal 2,000 appeals are rejected by the High Court in its season opener Monday Court also weighed "light" cigarette ad and Miranda protections Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO EXPLAINER From Bill Mears CNN Supreme Court Producer WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court rejected more than 2,000 pending appeals Monday, including a request to grant a new trial for former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer 27 years ago. The U.S. Supreme Court begins its new term by rejecting 2,000 appeals. The court opened its new term Monday with Chief Justice John Roberts leading a brief courtroom ceremony noting, "The October 2008 term is now convened." Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was among those in attendance. Abu-Jamal was given the death penalty, and the case has since attracted international attention stemming from allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. A federal appeals court has ordered a new sentencing hearing, so federal prosecutors will have to decide whether to again seek the death penalty or allow Abu-Jamal to spend the rest of his life behind bars. Prosecutors also have the choice of appealing the order for a new sentencing hearing to the Supreme Court. The 53-year-old onetime radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure, with many prominent supporters backing his contention that he was a victim of racism at his trial. Others have countered that Abu-Jamal is using skin color to escape responsibility for his actions, and say he has divided the community for years with his provocative writing and activism. Abu-Jamal is black, the police officer was white. A jury of 10 whites and two blacks convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death. One of the first cases justices tackled Monday dealt with an old issue: whether federal regulators have ultimate power over nationwide marketing practices, essentially blocking state courts from hearing lawsuits involving tobacco.

Election could decide future of federal courts
The broader issue is known as "pre-emption," and the conservative majority court in recent years has given business interests limited protection from such tort actions. The justices seemed similarly inclined in this appeal. When the lawyer for consumers said the issue was strictly about unfair marketing and not about proving health-related damages, several justices were skeptical. "How do you tell whether it's deceptive or not unless you look at what the relationship is between smoking and health?" asked Roberts. "The reason the product is of different value [under federal oversight] is that in fact it is dangerous to health," noted Justice David Souter. Three Maine smokers had brought suit against the nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, and its parent company, Altria Group. The individuals had smoked Marlboro Lights or Cambridge Lights for at least 15 years, according to court records. They allege the brand's labeling as "light" and "lowered tar and nicotine" was misleading, and sued the company in state court. A federal appeals court eventually allowed the case to go forward. The Federal Trade Commission, under authority from Congress, had approved for about four decades the testing method used by tobacco makers to measure tar and nicotine yields. The plaintiffs claimed internal industry documents cast doubt on the "light" claims and that the FTC failed to act to rein in such advertising. Smokers of light cigarettes, meanwhile, compensated by ingesting more smoke with longer puffs, thinking they were getting less nicotine and tar, they claimed. Congress had specifically pre-empted such individual state claims under a 1965 law. Only the Surgeon General's warnings on the dangers of smoking are allowed on cigarette packaging. The idea was to create uniform and clear labels, apart from myriad state warnings. The justices sought boundaries on just how far tobacco could make claims in its advertising. "Somebody could advertise smoking 42 cigarettes a day will grow your hair back," said Justice Stephen Breyer. Or, he added "it will build strong bodies eight ways." Laughter erupted in the courtroom. More seriously, Breyer noted the federal government over the years has respected state laws over the safety and advertising of consumer products. "What I can't understand is why Congress would want to get rid of, in this case, the traditional rule that advertising has to tell he truth," he said. "There is no evidence there is a problem. So why would Congress want to get rid of that particular statute?" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg expressed deep skepticism in her summary of the tobacco companies' case. "As far as the advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one decision-maker only, and that's the FTC, and if they don't act, then the cigarette companies can say anything they want?" The court in March ruled medical device makers could not be sued in state courts because the Food and Drug Administration has predominate jurisdiction over product safety. The justices will also hear an appeal next month over prescription drug labeling. A Vermont musician sued Wyeth Pharmaceuticals over an anti-nausea drug that was improperly administered, resulting in the amputation of her arm. She claims the drug warnings were inadequate, but the company says it is exempt from such lawsuits. The tobacco case is Altria Group Inc. v. Good (007-562). A ruling is expected in the next few months. Other noteworthy appeals the court denied came in a lengthy orders list, which offered no specific explanation for why the justices refused to intervene. • Lett v. U-S (07-1042) -- A federal trial judge mistakenly gave an Iraq war vet turned small-time drug dealer a criminal sentence, which the judge later reduced after being alerted by a lawyer friend of the defendant. The issue is whether such retroactive "corrections" are allowed. A federal appeals court agreed with federal prosecutors that the judge lacked the discretion to revise his sentence downward. • Translogic Technology v. Dudas (Patent Office Dir.) (07-1303) -- Dispute over the process for appointing administrative patent judges. • Kennedy v. Louisiana (07-343) -- Louisiana prosecutors have asked the Court to revisit its June decision banning capital punishment for child rapists, saying the justices committed a "significant error" when concluding there was a "national consensus" against executing non-murderers. The justices refused, saying such a consensus exists despite the change in federal military law. This case was announced last week. • Cerquiera v. American Airlines (07-1495) -- Can airlines be sued for alleged racial discrimination for refusing to board passengers for "safety" reasons? The captain says a man in a ponytail approached him in the terminal preflight in 2003 in Boston and asked if he was piloting his flight. When told yes, the stranger then said "Good. I'm going with you. We're going to have a good day today." The captain testified, "It [was] probably one of the most odd exchanges that I've ever had with anyone in my entire career, and it concerned me greatly." The passenger boarded the plane but was then removed, and a federal appeals court ruled it was proper. • Kentucky v. Leach (07-1213) -- Upheld a lower court ruling that police can conduct "knock and talk" investigations at a private residence back door without violating the Fourth Amendment. • DIRECTV v. Huynh (07-1261) -- A man is charged with "assembly" of piracy by removing then reinserting a previously disabled access card into a set-top receiver. The case was dismissed by the courts. • Lucero v. Texas (07-1429) -- A death row inmate wants a new trial after the jury foreman read Bible passages during deliberations to persuade holdouts to impose capital punishment. • Cate v. Anderson (07-1436) -- A suspect who repeatedly "pleaded the Fifth" and refused to talk was nevertheless interrogated further. Does that violate Miranda protections? • Yanai (warden) v. Girts (07-1452) -- Was it unfair for a prosecutor to make indirect references in closing arguments of a defendant's refusal to testify on his own behalf at trial? • American Coalition of Life Activists v. Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette (07-1546) -- An abortion clinic won a multimillion dollar judgment against authors of the "Nuremberg Files" Web site, which lists the names of slain abortion providers. The high court decided not to intervene.

Inside Zimbabwe's controversial Marange diamond field
By Victoria Eastwood and Robyn Curnow , CNN
updated 11:46 AM EDT, Fri March 16, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN granted exclusive access to the controversial Marange diamond fields
High voltage barbed wire fences surround the diamond mines, where workers are searched
Four Zimbabwe companies now can sell their diamonds on the international market
The human rights organization Global Witness called the decision "shocking"
Watch the full story of the Marketplace Africa's team inside Marange diamond fields at Friday March 16 1945, Saturday March 17 0245, 0515,1515, and Sunday March 18 0015, 1515 (All times GMT).
Mutare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- After weeks of negotiations with the government, CNN's Marketplace Africa show has been granted access to the controversial Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe.
Some experts believe that Marange is the largest diamond discovery in generations but the find has been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses and corruption going right to the heart of Mugabe's government.
There are four diamond companies operating in the area. With a large delegation of government minders in tow, CNN was first taken to visit Marange Resources. It is exclusively owned by the state-run company, the Zimbabwe Diamond Mining Corporation (ZMDC).
Security is tight. High voltage barbed wire fences surround the diamond mines and the processing plant's equipment. Several full body searches are done as you get closer to the sorting area where the diamonds are picked from the dirt.
Where is Zimbabwe's diamond wealth?
To avoid "leakages", as it is called - or, in other words, worker theft -- the diamonds are kept in a glass case and the sorters use gloves to drop the diamonds into an underground vault. The company says at no point in the extraction process does a human being touch any of the diamonds.
China's taste for diamonds
The mining manager of Marange Resources, Munashe Shava, tells CNN that "between our three plants we can produce a minimum of 200,000 carats every month."
Is the Kimberley Process in crisis?
All four mining companies - Marange, Mbada, Anjin and DMC - have been certified to sell their diamonds on the international market by the Kimberley Process.

The human rights organization Global Witness called the decision "shocking" and pulled out of the international scheme it helped create.
But despite the intense criticism of the Marange diamond fields, one of the two monitors of the Kimberley Process -- the U.N. protocol to certify origin of the gems and curtail trafficking of "blood diamonds" to fund militant groups - said he has seen significant improvements.
"You could not find a bigger transition than that one," Van Bockstael told CNN in Harare. "This is not a granny that is digging with an old shovel in a pit or something -- that happened in 2007, 2008, which was when the problems started. You are talking about now top-notch diamond companies that are using state-of-the-art equipment. "
The Chinese-run company Anjin has been one of the most heavily criticized companies operating in the field. Global Witness claims that this 50-50 partnership between a Chinese engineering firm and the state owned ZMDC has "board members including senior serving and retired military and police officers."
They argue that this "creates opportunities for off budget funding of the security sector" and " a real risk of these revenues being used to finance violence during a future election" in the country.

Human Rights Watch says while it has seen an improvement in Marange, it also believes questions remain over who is involved in running these mining companies.
Some experts believe the Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe are among the largest discovery of diamonds in generations.

Diamonds are being sorted in a glass case. Marange Resources says no human beings are allowed to touch the diamonds during the extraction process. Three plants of Marange Resources produce a minimum of 200,000 carats every month, according to its mining manager. Two local workers at a diamond mine owned by Marange Resources in Zimbabwe.

Marange diamond mine
"Well, when we say things have improved it simply means the violence has certainly ended" Tiseke Kasambala of Human Rights Watch told CNN. "There is no longer much torture, and the forced labor has come to an end, but why has this taken place? It is because the army has gained pretty much most of the control of the fields."
CNN confronted Zimbabwean director of Anjin, Munyaradzi Machacha, with these allegations. "In Zimbabwe, boards are made up of all its citizens," Machacha said. "With Anjin and all other companies, they are free to bring in persons with different skills and backgrounds. So really it is not like Anjin is a military (controlled) area, it is a civilian company operating like any other."
The Chairman of ZMDC, Godwills Masimirembwa, told CNN that there is nothing wrong with serving military figures connected to the ruling ZANU-PF being on the boards of these mining companies.
"There is nothing wrong with them sitting on some of the boards, they are Zimbabweans, they are entitled to sit on those boards."
When asked which military figures were connected with these companies, he replied:
"When you deal with sensitive issues, particularly in the background of sanctions against us, if you look at the sensitivity of that area, and the attack that is against Zimbabwe on the assumption that everything that goes there is for the benefit of ZANU-PF, it is obviously important that we protect the national interest".
But despite these mines getting the green light from the Kimberley Process, the European Union's so-called "restrictive measures" and U.S. government sanctions remain in place.
According to Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic, speaking to CNN's Marketplace Africa in her first interview as the new U.S. chair of the Kimberley Process, sanctions have been imposed because "these entities are undermining democracy and democratic institutions."
Ramzi Malik is the project manager of DMC, another mining company operating in the fields. The U.S. sanctions anger him.
"It was actually quite shocking that sanctions would be slapped on us even though we are fully compliant by the Kimberley Process," Malik says. "So for us we just continue doing our business and doing our thing, and that is the end of it."
"Sanctions or no sanctions diamonds get sold to clients all over the world, be it Belgium, be it Israel, be it India, be it customers in Dubai. They come from all over. You have the product available, they will come, they will pay their money for it and they will take it."

Teens' first choice for music listening? YouTube By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 6:24 PM EDT, Wed August 15, 2012 | Filed under: Web
Among teens, YouTube is the most popular way to listen to music, according to a Nielsen survey
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
YouTube is now most popular way teens listen to music
64 percent of teens say they listen to music through the site
Nielsen survey found radio is still most popular among all adults
About 1 in 3 teens bought a CD last year; more than half downloaded
(CNN) -- iTunes? Old news. Radio? Ancient history. Buying a new CD? Maybe every now and then.
But the most popular way today's teens discover music is through clicking around on YouTube.
That's the finding of a new study by media research firm Nielsen. Its Music 360 report set out to learn how music is found, purchased and consumed.
Among all adults, radio remains the most popular tool, with 48 percent saying that's how they usually discover their new jams.
Bibi Tanga bridges musical gap Duran Duran's racy turn in new video
Young listeners opting to stream, not own music
But more teens, 64 percent, cited YouTube, the Web's leading video-sharing site, as a place where they listen to music. Followed by radio (56%), iTunes (53% ) and CDs (50%).
The popularity of YouTube is dramatically higher among teens than all adults. Only 7 percent of all respondents said they discover music most frequently through the site.
Strangely, the report doesn't address teens' listening habits on music-streaming sites such as Pandora, Spotify or Grooveshark.
"The accessibility of music has seen tremendous expansion and diversification," said David Bakula, a Nielsen senior vice president. "While younger listeners opt for technologically advanced methods , traditional methods of discovery like radio and word-of-mouth continue to be strong drivers."
The study also shows the changing landscape of music sales. Just over one in three teens (36 percent) said they'd bought a CD in the past year, while more than half (51 percent) said they'd paid to download at least one song.
The report came from an online survey of 3,000 people in the United States.
Among all respondents, finding new music still relies upon a mix of new media and more traditional means.
In addition to the 48 percent who favor radio, 10 percent said they rely on friends or relatives for suggestions. But more than half (54 percent) said those personal recommendations make them more likely to make a purchase.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, claims more than 800 million unique visitors every month. More than 3 billion hours of videos are viewed each month and 72 hours worth of video are uploaded every minute, according to the site.

Messi and Ronaldo ensure honors shared in 222nd El Clasico
By Paul Gittings, CNN
updated 5:11 PM EDT, Sun October 7, 2012
Barcelona fans hold letters forming the word 'Independencia' and wave Catalan 'Estelada' independence flags in the match against Real Madrid. Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo celebrate goals in the El Clasico clash in the Camp Nou. Jose Mourinho gestures during the El Clasico clash with his Barcelona counterpart Tito Vilanova in the background. Barcelona's decision to invite a former captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit to the El Clasico clash was met with protests in Palestine.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Barcelona draw 2-2 with Real Madrid in El Clasico Two goals apiece from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo
Catalan giants Barcelona stay eight points clear of arch-rivals
Game held against backdrop of growing demands for indepedence for Catalonia (CNN) -- The 222nd El Clasico -- a match between Barcelona and Real Madrid which epitomizes the ultimate in team rivalry -- turned into an individual showcase for the two greatest players in world football and fittingly ended in a 2-2 draw Sunday.
Barcelona's Lionel Messi scored twice to put his side 2-1 ahead in their Camp Nou Stadium after an early strike from Real's Cristiano Ronaldo.
But the Portuguese star drew the reigning Spanish champions level on the hour mark with his second goal and almost certainly kept their title hopes alive.
They trail leaders Barcelona by eight points after seven games, 11 would have been almost insurmountable.
José Mourinho on managing star players
Cristiano Ronaldo: I'm better than Messi
Is Jose Mourinho leaving Real Madrid? A draw was probably a fair result although it is unlikely the majority of the 98,000 fans who crammed into Barcelona's magnificent home stadium would have agreed.
Because at stake is not just the result of a football match but the very pride and honor of the Catalan people.
Independence calls
Many from this semi-autonomous region of Spain want full independence and last month more than a million people demanded just that in a demonstration in Barcelona.
Former Barca manager Pepe Guardiola publicly supported that ambition, which has gathered pace in the austerity-hit country, with many Catalonia citizens believing they are paying more than their fair share into the coffers of the government in Madrid.
This feeling of Catalan identity embodied in a football club is summed up by Barcelona's motto "mes que un club" -- more than a club, and clashes against Real Madrid are chances to give vent to their feelings.
Austerity gives El Clasico added twist The passionate atmosphere Sunday went up a notch as Barcelona officials allowed fans to display the yellow and red colors of Catalonia in a giant mosaic, holding up cards to get the effect.
And at exactly 17 minutes and 14 seconds, chants for independence rang out in reference to the Catalans' military defeat to the Royalists in the War of Spanish Succession in 1714.
Political football Barcelona's central defender Gerard Pique had tweeted Saturday that he wanted politics to say out of El Clasico.
"The games between Barcelona and Madrid increasingly resemble Catalonia against Spain and this should not happen," he wrote.
"It's just a football match."
Whether all his fellow players agreed with Pique, they certainly missed him in defense as he was ruled out by injury.
The full throated chants had barely subsided when Ronaldo ran through a big gap in the Barcelona back line and shot past Victor Valdes on 22 minutes.
It was a record sixth goal in six matches against Barcelona and Real would be left to rue a miss by Karim Benzema soon afterwards which might have led to a different result.
His mishit shot hit the post and by halftime Messi had equalized after hesitation in the Real defense.
Is this El Clasico a must win game for Real?
In the second half, Messi was fouled just outside the Real penalty area and got up to send an unstoppable free kick past Iker Casillas.
But Ronaldo replied when weakness at the heart of the home defense was again evident and he equalized with a low shot.
Both sides had chances to grab the three points but had to settle for a draw.
Controversial invite
The political undertones behind the latest El Clasico found further expression in the decision by Barcelona to invite Gilad Shalit, a former Israeli soldier who was held captive in Gaza for nearly five years.
It risked alienating their many supporters in the Palestine region and the Hamas government called for a boycott of the television coverage.
Barcelona responded by inviting a former Palestine international player Mahmoud Sarsak, who had been detained by the Israelis, but he declined to come.

Woman busted in Spain for cocaine in breast implants
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 7:18 AM EST, Thu December 13, 2012
A woman was arrested in the El Prat airport in Spain for carrying cocaine in her breast implants.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The suspect landed on a "hot flight" to Barcelona from Bogota, Colombia Her story just didn't sound right to border agents
A pat-down revealed blood-stained bandage material
A hospital removed breast implants full of cocaine
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
(CNN) -- She arrived on a suspicious flight. Her story didn't sound right. And then there was the blood ... under her breasts.
An airport security check in Spain led to an operating table for a passenger -- where, authorities said, they found she had tucked packs of cocaine in her breast implants.
The Panamanian citizen landed at Barcelona's Prat airport on a so-called "hot flight," one that came from a destination known for drug trafficking -- in this case Bogota, Colombia.
Ninety percent of cocaine trafficked into the United States, for example, comes from Colombia, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
The passenger came under the scrutiny of security agents, who weren't satisfied with the vague answers she kept giving about why she was in town, Spain's interior ministry said.
Her behavior aroused the suspicion of officers that she might be carrying drugs either in her luggage or on her.
When a female officer patted down the woman, she found bloodied bandage material under the passenger's breasts. The gauze, the officer found, was covering incisions. And the breasts were hiding "a white foreign material."
Fresh breast implants, the suspect mustered an explanation. Must not have healed up right.
The story didn't convince police, who hauled her off to a hospital.
"There, a medical team extracted a bag-shaped prosthesis from each breast containing a white pasty substance," the ministry said.
Cocaine. Nearly 1.4 kilograms (3 lbs) of it.
Pure cocaine goes for about $35,000 a pound, according to the DEA.
The expensive implants landed her in jail.
CNN's Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.

Clarence Thomas breaks years of silence on bench
By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer
updated 5:34 AM EST, Tue January 15, 2013
The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court sit for their official photograph on October 8, 2010, at the Supreme Court. Front row, from left: Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Back row, from left: Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito Jr. and Elena Kagan.
In 2005, Chief Justice John G. Roberts was nominated by President George W. Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as an associate justice. After Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, however, Bush named Roberts to the chief justice post. The court has moved to the right during his tenure, although Roberts supplied the key vote to uphold President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Justice Antonin Scalia was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to fill the seat vacated by Justice William Rehnquist when he was elevated to chief justice. A constitutional originalist -- and a colorful orator -- Scalia is a member of the court's conservative wing. He is currently the court's longest-serving justice.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. He is a conservative justice but has provided crucial swing votes in many cases, writing the majority opinion, for example, in Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down that state's sodomy law. Justice Clarence Thomas is the second African-American to serve on the court, succeeding Justice Thurgood Marshall when he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991. He is a conservative, a strict constructionist who supports states' rights.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, she is a strong voice in the court's liberal minority.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer was appointed to the court in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. He is considered a member of the court's liberal minority.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 and is known as one of the most conservative justices to serve on the court in modern times.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor is the court's first Hispanic and third female justice. She was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and is regarded as a resolutely liberal member of the court.
Justice Elena Kagan is the fourth female justice and a member of the court's liberal wing. She was appointed in 2010, at the age of 50, by President Barack Obama and is the court's youngest member.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Clarence Thomas known for remaining quiet during oral arguments
On Monday, he joked about lawyers educated at Yale, his alma mater
Current Supreme Court known as 'hot bench' for the rhetorical scrum during arguments
Washington (CNN) -- It was just a few words and a joke at that. But Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas broke his seven-year long silence on Monday when he spoke at oral arguments.
He made fun of lawyers from Yale, his law school alma mater.
Thomas has become known for rarely commenting on cases from the bench, another reflection of the complex and often misunderstood personality of the court's only African-American jurist.
On Monday, the justices were hearing an argument about the state of Louisiana's delay in paying for counsel for a death penalty defendant. Should that count against the state for the purposes of the right to a speedy trial?
A lawyer for the state was making the case for the inmate's appointed counsel, saying the woman was "more than qualified" and "very impressive."
"She was graduate of Yale Law School, wasn't she?" said Justice Antonin Scalia in apparent support, noting another member of the legal team went to Harvard.
The next words were hard to hear in the back-and-forth between the justices. But Thomas made a joke about the competence of Yale lawyers when compared to their Harvard colleagues, according to two witnesses.
2011: Thomas under fire again
Hollingsworth v. Perry (2013): The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal over California's Proposition 8 on jurisdictional grounds. The voter-approved ballot measure barring same-sex marriage was not defended by state officials, but rather a private party. This ruling cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California to resume, but left open-ended the legal language of 35 other states barring same-sex marriage. Take a look at other important cases decided by the high court.
United States v. Windsor (2013): When her wife died in 2009, Edith Windsor, 84, was forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes because her marriage was not recognized by the federal government's Defense of Marriage Act of 1996. The Supreme Court struck down the part of the law which denied legally marriage same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses.
National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012): The Supreme Court upheld most of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's health care reform law, on June 28, 2012. The decision determined how hundreds of millions of Americans will receive health care.
Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010): Activists rally in February 2012 to urge the Supreme Court to overturn its decision that fundamentally changed campaign finance law by allowing corporations and unions to contribute unlimited funds to political action committees not affiliated with a candidate.
Texas v. Johnson (1989): The Supreme Court overturned the decision that convicted Gregory Lee Johnson of desecrating a venerated object after he set an American flag on fire during a protest. The court ruled that Johnson (at right with his lawyer, William Kunstler) was protected under the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. United States v. Nixon (1974): When President Richard Nixon claimed executive privilege over taped conversations regarding the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled that he had to turn over the tapes and other documents. The ruling set a precedent limiting the power of the president of the United States. Roe v. Wade (1973): Norma McCorvey, identified as "Jane Roe," sued Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade over a law that made it a felony to have an abortion unless the life of the mother was in danger. The court agreed with Roe and overruled any laws that made abortion illegal in the first trimester. Here, McCorvey, left, stands with her attorney Gloria Allred in 1989.
Miranda v. Arizona (1966): Ernesto Miranda confessed to a crime without the police informing him of his right to an attorney or right against self-incrimination. His attorney argued in court that the confession should have been inadmissible, and in 1966, the Supreme Court agreed. The term "Miranda rights" has been used since. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963): The Supreme Court overturned the burglary conviction of Clarence Earl Gideon after he wrote to the court from his prison cell, explaining he was denied the right to an attorney at his 1961 trial. Mapp v. Ohio (1961): The Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Dollree Mapp because the evidence collected against her was obtained during an illegal search. The ruling re-evaluated the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Brown v. Board of Education (1954): Nathaniel Steward recites his lesson surrounded by white classmates at the Saint-Dominique School in Washington. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to separate students based on race. Korematsu v. United States (1944): Fred Korematsu, a Japanese-American man, was arrested after authorities found out that he claimed to be a Mexican-American to avoid an internment camp during World War II. The court ruled that the rights of an individual were not as important as the need to protect the country during wartime. In 1998, President Bill Clinton awarded Korematsu the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Plessy v. Ferguson (1896): Homer Plessy was arrested when he refused to leave a whites-only segregated train car, claiming he was 7/8 white and only 1/8 black. The Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" facilities for blacks were constitutional, which remained the rule until Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.
Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857): When Dred Scott asked a circuit court to reward him his freedom after moving to a free state, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress didn't have the right to prohibit slavery and, further, that those of African-American descent were not protected by the Constitution. Gibbons v. Ogden (1824): This was the first case to establish Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. The ruling signaled a shift in power from the states to the federal government. Aaron Ogden, seen here, was given exclusive permission from the state of New York to navigate the waters between New York and certain New Jersey ports. When Ogden brought a lawsuit against Thomas Gibbons for operating steamships in his waters, the Supreme Court sided with Gibbons.
McCulloch v. Maryland (1819): In response to the federal government's controversial decision to institute a national bank in the state, Maryland tried to tax the bank out of business. When a federal bank cashier, James W. McCulloch, refused to pay the taxes, the state of Maryland filed charges against him. In McCulloch v. Maryland, the Supreme Court ruled that chartering a bank was an implied power of the Constitution. The first national bank, pictured, was created by Congress in 1791 in Philadelphia. Marbury v. Madison (1803): When Secretary of State James Madison, seen here, tried to stop Federal loyalists from being appointed to judicial positions, he was sued by William Marbury. Marbury was one of former President John Adams' appointees, and the court decided that although he had a right to the position, the court couldn't enforce his appointment. The case defined the boundaries of the executive and judicial branches of government.

Six members of the current high court attended Harvard Law School. Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor attended Yale.
Sotomayor describes life journey in new memoir
The official transcript released by the court does not capture the flavor of the colorful exchange. But the lawyer arguing before the court was apparently not pleased.
"I would refute that, Justice Thomas," said Carla Sigler, the assistant district attorney in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
The rest of the time, Thomas kept his own counsel as he is known to do.
"One thing I've demonstrated often in 16 years is you can do this job without asking a single question," he recalled in a speech five years ago.
Written opinions remain the main way the court expresses itself. But the current court is known as a "hot bench" for the busy back-and-forth rhetorical scrum during arguments.
Eight of the justices compete for time to make their questions and views known.
Thomas does occasionally speak from the bench when announcing opinions he has written, but before arguments commence.
Off the bench in friendly audiences, he can be gregarious, inquisitive and often self-reflective. He has a booming voice, and his hearty laugh is easily recognizable.
Some scholars have said Thomas' aversion to talking has reached epic heights.
A study of transcripts by Timothy Johnson of the University of Minnesota found in the past four decades, no justice besides Thomas had failed to speak at least once during an entire 12-month term.
The last time he spoke was February 22, 2006, during a capital appeal.

'Snowquester' doesn't pan out in DC; situation nastier in Virginia

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Shelters are open for 215,000 without power in Virginia
NEW: A coastal flood warning is in effect for Massachusetts
Virginia's governor declares a state of emergency
Are you experiencing winter weather in your area? Share your story with CNN iReport.
(CNN) -- They'd hoped to trade political potshots for wet snowballs.
Instead, the storm billed as "Snowquester" is turning out to be nothing more than a big wet blanket for members of the Washington D.C. Snowball Fight Association. The group had planned a big showdown in DuPont Circle, where a few years ago 3,000 people turned out for a humdinger of a fight.
But where 5 to 10 inches of wet snow was supposed to fall on DuPont Circle, not even slush was accumulating Wednesday afternoon, said organizer Michael Lipin.
"Quite a letdown," he said.

Zoo animals, workers deal with snow
While the storm was dumping plenty of snow in other places, Washington was getting just fractions of an inch, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris.
In fact, the National Weather Service dropped its winter storm warning for the Washington area Wednesday afternoon.
"It's just not panning out to be the storm we'd thought it would be," Morris said.
In nearby Virginia, however, things were quite different.
Gov. Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency, state police extended shifts and the National Guard called up 100 troops for snow duty as inches of wet, heavy snow fell across parts of the state.
Authorities opened shelters for the 215,000 Virginians without power, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.
Transportation officials reported particularly nasty conditions on many secondary and some primary routes in 15 central and northern counties, with deep snow or ice covering the pavement. State and many county offices closed early.
About 4,200 utility workers were in the field trying to deal with outages, Rodney Blevins of Dominion Power said during a news conference.
How do you really feel about the snow?
Airlines canceled more than 1,600 flights, leaving passengers such as Alex Thompson, who had hoped to take a flight to San Francisco, with plenty of time on their hands.
Thompson traveled all the way from Kenya only to find that his next flight was one of hundreds called off until Thursday because of the storm.
With no hotel reservations and nowhere else to go, he said he'd find a place to sack out at Dulles International Airport and "waste my time until I can get on my flight."
Capital closings
The dire forecast issued Tuesday prompted the federal government to close offices in the nation's capital, but emergency workers and telecommuters were expected to be on duty, according to the Office of Personnel Management.
The White House canceled a planned celebration for the Alabama Crimson Tide, college football champions, and Congress called off several hearings.
More than 954,000 students who attend major school districts in Washington, Virginia, Maryland and Ohio got the day off.
Amtrak shut down some trains in Washington, Virginia, West Virginia and New York.
Track the late-winter storm
But tourism goes on
Not all of Washington was shut down. Although the National Zoo was closed, the Smithsonian said its museums would be open for visitors.
Washington's Metrorail system was running, although some bus service was disrupted, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
Flooding threat
Along the coast, the problem wasn't snow, but high winds and the threat of flooding.
The National Weather Service issued coastal flood warnings for parts of Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
Officials in parts of New Jersey suggested residents evacuate from flood-prone areas along the coast, including areas still recovering from damage done by Hurricane Sandy in October, according to CNN affiliate WABC.
A flood warning was in effect through Friday morning for the eastern coast of Massachusetts based on a "high confidence" for high winds, storm surge, and moderate to major coastal flooding, the state's emergency management agency said.
About 300 National Guard troops will be used along the Massachusetts coast to help with flooding and possible evacuations, agency spokesman Peter Judge said.
Fifty Delaware National Guard troops were called up as emergency management officials urged some coastal residents in that state to evacuate, saying flooding would cut off exit routes. The agency warned of almost certain flooding in areas and said "conditions during the height of the storm could make the process of leaving flooded areas dangerous or impossible."
High winds forced the brief closure of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in both directions, Maryland authorities said, but not before a tractor trailer overturned on one end, CNN affiliate WJZ reported.
Wind was believed to have been a major factor in the accident.
Power was out across the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, Delmarva Power reported.
In coastal Sussex County, the 911 center reported numerous calls for wires down, vehicle accidents and trees down.
Water breached a sand dune in Sussex County, forcing the closure of State Route 1 in the county, according to DEMA.
Is the snow helping ease drought?
Midwest recovering
The storm is the same one that earlier dumped about a foot of snow in parts of Illinois, Minnesota and North Dakota, paving a white swath across the Upper Midwest.
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had 6 inches of snow Tuesday, beating a 1999 record for the date by 2.2 inches. It was the first snowfall of 6 inches or more in the Windy City since February 2011, the weather service said.
Plows removed snow from roads and trucks spread salt and sand, but drivers still slipped off of roadways, leaving snow-covered cars to be retrieved by tow trucks.
Tuesday's snow put a drag on air traffic in the Midwest, leading to delays and cancellations, but planes continued to fly in Columbus, Ohio, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, after plows removed the snow from runways.
Analyze the snowfall
CNN's Dave Hennen, Shannon Travis, Melissa Gray, Devon Sayers, Dave Alsup, Mariano Castillo, Dana Ford, Phil Gast, Ben Brumfield, Joe Johns, and Lawrence Crook contributed to this report

Kids and guns: 'These are not isolated tragedies'
By Jen Christensen, CNN
updated 1:02 PM EDT, Wed April 24, 2013
Dr. Angela Sauaia says her findings show there "is a real public health concern for children."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A study of Colorado trauma center data finds a high number of kids' gun injuries
Expert: More of this kind of research should be done
Federal law prevents agencies from using funds to promote gun control
(CNN) -- Dr. Angela Sauaia and her colleagues intended to study the impact modernized playground equipment had on lowering children's injury rates. They ended up studying kids' injury rates from guns instead.
The associate professor of public health, medicine and surgery at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora said she was neither motivated by the recent mass shooting in her area nor driven by politics.
"My colleagues and I were doing a study on playground injuries, because they were doing some remodeling projects here, and we wanted to see if that would change the playground injury rate," Sauaia said.
"When we started coding the trauma data, which includes all types of childhood injuries that turn up at these trauma centers, and we noticed the morbid pattern of gun violence-related injuries for children ... that shifted the focus of the study to document violence related to injuries involving gunshots."
Obama angry about gun bill failure
Risch: Background checks are inefficient Manufacturers impacted by new gun laws
The data, she said, showed a surprising number of children were being injured, many of them seriously, by guns.
"We had the impression that mass shootings caused so many injuries and those normally do get a lot of national attention, but in looking at the numbers, gun violence was happening to children on a routine basis, and it was mostly happening out of the spotlight," Sauaia said. "These are not isolated tragedies."
She and her colleagues knew they were on to something, putting together a research letter called "Firearm Injuries of Children and Adolescents in 2 Colorado Trauma Centers: 2000-2008," which was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The data covers some of the years between the two mass shootings in the Denver area -- the 1999 one at Columbine High School that resulted in 13 deaths and more than 20 injuries before the shooters took their own lives, and July's mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora that killed 12 people and wounded 58.
Columbine survivor: No child should worry about gunmen
"In the years we studied, we didn't expect to see this many childhood injuries due to everyday gun violence," Sauaia said. "And far too many of these were self-inflicted."
Intentionality was difficult to determine from the data -- some of the self-inflicted wounds were suicide, while others appeared accidental in nature.
The bottom line, said Sauaia: Children having access to guns.
"No matter what side you are on in the gun debate, I've never met a person that believes kids should have easy access to guns," Sauaia said. "The data clearly shows this is a real public health concern for children."
Overall, 6,920 youths were injured and cared for by these trauma centers between 2000 and 2008, according to the research. Of those, 129 had injuries from firearms, and those injuries were extremely serious compared with the others.
Of the gun injuries, 50.4% required intensive care, compared with 19.3% for other trauma-related injuries. Some 13.2% died, compared with the 1.7% injured in another way. A total of 14% of the gunshot wounds were coded as "self-inflicted."
Once-unlikely win for gun control in Colorado
The research is a good and descriptive small-scale study, said Jon Vernick, an associate professor and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, but it also is a good reminder that public health experts need to do more of this kind of research.
"This study shows firearm injures are more likely to result in a death or a treatment in the ICU than other injuries," he said. "That should make the case for how important it is to find ways to prevent those kinds of injuries from occurring."
Historically, he argued, public health studies such as this one have led to positive changes.
Because people studied why car accidents happened in the 1960s, for instance, public health advocates knew how to improve injury rates from such crashes, Vernick said. Consequently, such injuries declined dramatically.
"They didn't just try to make drivers safer or try to criminalize (drunken) driving -- that alone wouldn't have worked," Vernick said. "Because we had the research, we also knew we had to make cars safer, make the environment safer, change the social norm to make it socially unacceptable to drive drunk.
"All of this concerted effort was a public health success story, and it came about because we had the research. We haven't had the same robust research agenda on gun violence over the last two decades, and so we are not seeing the same dramatic decline in deaths and injuries."
How we can keep kids from shooting people
Data, Sauaia said, are available from trauma centers, but there is limited funding for studies.
Federal funding for gun research, however, is rare, outside of federal grants that are available to study other injuries. That's deliberate. Since 1996, federal law has prohibited all Department of Health and Human Services agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health from using funds, "in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control."
The National Rifle Association pushed for the legislation, maintaining that government research into gun violence is unnecessary.
"What works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others don't have access to firearms," NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN in January, "not to carry out more studies."
How the NRA wields its influence A strongly worded editorial published in JAMA Internal Medicine in January called the federal government's "neglect" of firearm injuries as a public health issue a "national shame." It asked President Barack Obama to "make a concerted effort to get the restrictive language about using federal funds ... out of future appropriations bills."
"If the United States were to get serious about preventing firearms-related injuries and deaths, thousands of lives could be saved each year," the authors wrote. "We can wait no longer to protect public health."
Sauaia said she wants her paper to inform today's debate and inspire other projects.
"We do know a lot more about how someone died of a heart attack than just how many people were injured by guns," Sauaia said. "The data is out there; we just need the funding to be able to do this kind of work, and then hopefully we can find ways to address this major public health problem."

Depp's last two films, "Dark Shadows" and "The Rum Diary," also severely under-performed
(EW.com) -- Over the extended 4th of July weekend, a lot of Americans lit up the grill and spent time with family. A lot unfolded lawn chairs and watched a fireworks show. And a whole lot bought tickets to see Despicable Me 2.
The $76 million animated film from Universal and Illumination Entertainment crushed the competition in its first five days in theaters, earning a jaw-dropping $142 million — $82.5 million of which came in during the traditional Friday-to-Sunday frame. In fact, Despicable Me 2, which features the voice work of Steve Carrell and Kristen Wiig, led the box office to the best July 4th weekend of all time. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, the Top 12 movies grossed $220.7 million, which marks the 10th-strongest weekend in box office history.
Despicable Me 2's $82.5 million start just barely beat Monsters University's $82.4 million debut (though that film opened on a Friday, not a Wednesday), and its $142.5 million start stands as the best ever five-day opening for an animated film ahead of Shrek 2's $128.9 million haul in May 2004. Like that film, Despicable Me 2 earned an "A" CinemaScore grade from audiences. Universal reports that crowds were 60-percent female and 55-percent below the age of 25 — the studio adds that 27 percent of viewers were Hispanic.
"We knew it was going to be hugely successful," admits Nikki Rocco, Universal's president of distribution, who says family business was "phenomenal" and made up "the bulk of business" She also points to the film's prime summer release date and the fact that families were together for the July 4th holiday as contributing factors.

Internationally, Despicable Me 2 topped the box office in 36 of the 38 countries it played in this weekend and has earned $151.1 million overseas, which brings its very early worldwide total to $293.2 million.
Notably, only 27 percent of Despicable Me 2's domestic weekend gross came from 3-D ticket sales — a low for the format. Still, that doesn't take away from the sensibly budgeted film's incredible success. At this point, it's already a lock for $300 million.
It was a very different story for Disney's $225 million western The Lone Ranger, which only lassoed a dismal $48.9 million — $29.4 million of which poured in during the Friday-to-Sunday period. The film, which stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, joins Cowboys and Aliens and Wild Wild West as films that attempted (unsuccessfully) to turn the western genre into widely-appealing, popcorn-munching spectacles.
For director Gore Verbinski and Depp, who previously collaborated on the ultra-successful Pirates of the Caribbean films, the terrible opening is particularly distressing. Depp's last two films, Dark Shadows and The Rum Diary, also severely under-performed. The reality is, though, that westerns have always been a tough sell at the box office. The highest grossing western of all time, Dances with Wolves, earned $184.2 million in 1990. The Lone Ranger's budget (which does not include substantial marketing and distribution costs), was a full $41 million more than that — so the bar for success was set incredibly high. And the financial setback for Disney will likely be incredibly high as well.
"Obviously you're always hoping that your movies are going to connect with the broadest audience possible," says Dave Hollis, Disney's president of distribution, "so when it doesn't, it's disappointing." The exec acknowledges that young people were largely unfamiliar with the 80-year-old character of the Lone Ranger, as evidenced by the fact that audiences were 68 percent above the age of 25. Those crowds issued the film a fair "B+" CinemaScore.
In third, Fox's $43 million buddy-cop comedy The Heat fell 36 percent in its second weekend to $25 million, giving the Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy title a strong $86.4 million after ten days.
Fourth place belonged to Monsters University, which took a whopping 57 percent hit due to the arrival of Despicable Me 2. Still, the film grossed $19.6 million this weekend, which gives it $216.1 million total and makes it the 11th Pixar film (out of 14) to surpass the $200 million mark domestically. Worldwide, Monsters University, which likely cost about $200 million to produce, reached the $400 million milestone.
World War Z rounded out the Top 5, dipping 39 percent to $18.2 million. The Brad Pitt zombie thriller has now earned $158.8 million after three weekends and could reach $190 million total — the same amount that Paramount says World War Z cost to make.
1. Despicable Me 2 -- $82.5 million
2. The Lone Ranger -- $48.9 million
3. The Heat -- $25 million
4. Monsters University -- $19.6 million
5. World War Z -- $18.2 million
In eighth place, Lionsgate's comedy Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain grossed a remarkable $17.5 million from just 786 theaters over its first five days. Of that, $10.1 million came in over the three-day period, which is even more impressive given the film's teensy $2.5 million budget. Lionsgate targeted African-American viewers for Let Me Explain, the same demographic that pushed Hart's breakout film, Laugh at My Pain, to a $7.7 million gross in 2011.
