The truth about lying spouses Story Highlights Study reveals that spouses lie most to each other over their whereabouts Couples are more truthful about sex, money and 'the kids' Europeans are most likely deceive about sexNext Article in World » By George Webster For CNN (CNN) -- A new international survey on marital deceit has revealed that spouses are most likely to mislead each other over their whereabouts. The survey, conducted by Reader's Digest and published in the magazine's September edition, asked readers from 15 countries to declare what issues they have lied to their partner about. Overwhelmingly, "my whereabouts" was the most popular response, with 14 of the 15 countries placing it top of a list which included touchy topics like sex, money, and "the kids". Russian men are most disposed to hiding their tracks, with 67 percent admitting they had lied to their wife about it, according to the survey. However, in a possible clue to why Russian divorce rates are highest among countries polled, Russian women fared little better -- 58 percent giving the same response. This compares with an average of 39 percent of Americans, 45 percent of Australians, 47 percent of Indians and 56 percent of Brits. Italy is the most scrupulous nation -- only 33 percent have lied about their location. For Peggy Northrop, Global Editor-in-chief of Reader's Digest, the findings are unexpected: Don't Miss Eight marriage busters to give up today
13 things your mother-in-law won't tell you Six ways to feel closer now
"In this day and age of being overly-connected, it was surprising to learn that the majority of people surveyed across the board still think they can get away with lying about their whereabouts." She told CNN. Malaysia is the only nation to place money above whereabouts -- 68 percent of men and 42 percent of women have not been entirely up front about the bank balance, the survey said. In much of the world sex is far less a source of deception than many would assume. In the UK only 5 percent of men and 7 percent of women have lied to their spouse about sexual conduct, while in the U.S the overall average is just 8 percent. However, other European nations are a little more flexible with the truth when it comes to sex. Italians add to their amorous reputation: 23 percent of those surveyed have lied to their partner about bedroom exploits. They are trumped only by Germans, 25 percent of whom have not been totally candid on the topic. Though the findings could point toward a global trend of married couples leading double lives, British psychologist and author Dr. Rob Yeung offers a more sober perspective. "Money, sex, and the children are such big topics that it's a more fundamental breach of trust to lie about them," he said. "Most spouses believe that they deserve complete honesty about the family's finances, their current and past sexual relationships, and matters concerning the children. However, there is comparatively less significance attached to one's whereabouts, and so it's much easier to lie about."

How bad is it? Depends on which nuclear expert you ask By the CNN Wire Staff 'They don't do that anymore'STORY HIGHLIGHTSNuclear physicist: "We don't know enough to assess the long-term or short-term effects"The IAEA is not rating the latest incident in Japan on the international scaleSome experts say there's too little information to determine long-term effectsTune in to CNN Tuesday night at 8 ET for special editions of "In the Arena," "Piers Morgan Tonight" and "AC360�." Anderson Cooper, Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Soledad O'Brien report live from Japan on the quake and tsunami's catastrophic effects. Are you there? Share your photos and videos if you can do so safely. (CNN) -- Experts disagreed Tuesday over just how bad things have gotten at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, but all of them agreed that things could get worse. An explosion Tuesday at the plant elevated the situation there to a "serious accident," on a level just below Chernobyl, a French nuclear official said, referring to the international scale that rates the severity of such incidents and to an incident 25 years ago in what is now Ukraine. His comments came before a fire was reported Wednesday in the No. 4 reactor building at the Japanese plant. The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale -- or INES -- ranks incidents from Level 1, which indicates very little danger to the general population, to Level 7, a "major accident" with a large release of radioactive material and widespread health and environmental effects. "It's clear we are at Level 6, that's to say we're at a level in between what happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl," Andre-Claude Lacoste, president of France's nuclear safety authority, told reporters Tuesday. The core meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Middletown, Pennsylvania, in 1979 caused no injuries or deaths, and only low levels of radiation were found later in plants and animals, experts said. At least 30 people died following the 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl, and large swaths of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia were contaminated from the nuclear fallout. Thousands of cases of childhood thyroid cancer resulted, according to Dr. Ira Helfand of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which opposes the use of nuclear power. Japanese nuclear authorities initially rated the incident that began last Friday with a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in northeastern Japan followed by a tsunami at Level 4, according to Greg Webb of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Level 4 is characterized as a minor release of radioactive material that necessitates only measures to control food due to contamination. But in the latest information about the explosion, Japanese authorities did not give it a rating, Webb said, and the IAEA did not cite one either. GE scientist quit over reactor design

Japan's nuclear situation vs. Chernobyl
But Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund and author of "Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats," said the level is far beyond 4. "We are way beyond Three Mile Island level and heading into Chernobyl territory," he told CNN in a telephone interview. "This is at least a 5, probably a 6 and it could end up a 7." He added, "This is not going to end well. At the very least, we're going to have a very expensive mess to clean up, and the worst is that we we spread radioactive particles across hundreds or thousands of square miles of Japan." The Institute for Science and International Security agreed the initial rating was low. "The explosion in the Unit 2 reactor, the third so far, and the fire in the spent fuel pond in the reactor building for Unit 4 means that this accident can no longer be viewed as a level 4 on the INES scale," the institute said Tuesday in a posting on its website. "This event is now closer to a level 6, and it may unfortunately reach a level 7," it said. Level 6 events have broad consequences that require countermeasures to deal with the radioactive contamination. Level 7 events would constitute a larger release of radioactive material and would require further countermeasures. Another way to measure the incidents would be to rank them in comparison with Chernobyl, deemed the worst, and Three Mile Island. "My guess is this is now number two, but I need to need to look at the data more carefully," said James Acton, an associate in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment and a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow. Tom Cochran, a senior scientist in the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he would guess that the incident ranks "a little worse than Three Mile Island and not nearly as bad as Chernobyl." But, he complained, he could not look at the data because they had not been made available. "There are too many variables: First is the lack of transparency on the part of the Japanese." Even if the Japanese prove capable of keeping coolant in the three reactors that have experienced partial core meltdowns, many uncertainties remain, he said. One of them is whether the containment vessels will keep any molten nuclear material from entering the environment. "If it does pool in the bottom of the reactor, after some period of time it will probably eat through the reactor into the primary containment area which is, or should be, sealed, but may not be," he said.

You can always play the game of, what's the worst-case situation? And the worst case can get pretty bad--Tom Cochran, senior scientist, Natural Resources Defense Council

If the containment system is breached, "you have more or less direct access to the environment. At that point, you expect the volatile fission products and the gaseous fission products to get out of the system. That would be things like Krypton 85, Iodine 131 and Cesium 137." Given that prevailing winds were blowing out to sea and people who lived within 20 kilometers of the plant had been evacuated, Cochran said he was sanguine about the possible outcome. "But you can always play the game of, what's the worst-case situation? And the worst case can get pretty bad." Whatever happens, the incident will greatly affect the calculation of probabilities associated with nuclear power risk, he said. The probability of a core melt had been estimated at about one chance in 10,000 reactor years of operation, he said. "We've had now three core melts in 30 years in less than 500 reactors, he said, referring to Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and now Japan. "So the probability of a partial core melt is one chance in several hundred instead of one chance in 10,000. So, it's not a good statistic." Many experts said it could be a long time before they are able to determine the incident's impact. "We don't know enough to assess the long-term or short-term effects of this," said Kirby Kemper, a nuclear physicist, physics professor and vice president of research at Florida State University. Kemper said it appears the radioactive material released had largely dissipated into the atmosphere. However, he added, authorities would will have to test the soil for contamination in the 20-kilometer radius of the plant that was evacuated before anyone should be allowed to return home. Trying to place the situation on the INES scale is premature, said David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University. "I've been asked to put a number on it a few times and I've resisted," he said. Cochran said his concerns transcend nuclear power. "We've watched Exxon Valdez, the BP oil spill, numerous coal mining accidents, Chernobyl, TMI, now Fukushima, slag ponds, TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) reactors giving way. You have got to ask yourself, how many wake-up calls do you need before you get serious about building a safe, renewable-energy economy?"CNN's Alanne Orjoux, Tom Watkins, Michael Pearson and Richard Greene contributed to this report

Inspector general probe finds nepotism in Justice Department Justice unit
By Terry Frieden, CNN Justice Department Producer
updated 5:07 PM EDT, Thu July 26, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
This is the third investigation of such allegations in the department
Two executives allegedly colluded to hire each other's children, the report says
Several other incidents of relatives being hired also were found, it says
Washington (CNN) -- Eight employees of the management division of the Justice Department violated laws and regulations by seeking to have their relatives hired for high-level jobs in the department, or ignored evidence of such violations, according to an inspector general's report released Thursday.
The practices, described by one official as "egregious," were discovered in the third investigation of the department's Justice Management Division in the past decade. Similar improper hiring practices were found by the department's inspector general in investigations in 2004 and 2008. Despite those critical reports, the practices continued, the report says.
The inspector general alleged "collusion between the Department of Justice's Office of Personnel and the Facilities and Administrative Services staff to illegally hire each other's family."
Human Resources Assistant Director Pamela Cabell-Edelen and Facilities and Administrative Services Director Edward Hamilton hired each other's children, the report says. Hamilton chose Cabell-Edelen's daughter to be his secretary in 2009. Hamilton then promptly began pushing a job for his son in Cabell-Edelen's office, and the son was hired.
Both executives are accused of lying to inspector general investigators about their actions, the report says.
The Justice Management Division is an important part of the Justice Department, as it is responsible for a wide range of issues including the Justice Department budget, financial matters, human resources, facilities and administrative services. It is the only division headed by a career employee rather than a presidentially nominated employee.
Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus has headed the division since 2006. He is a 30-year Justice Department employee who worked his way up through the ranks as a financial officer and controller.
In other cases highlighted by the report, the daughter of the facilities deputy was hired by a human resources assistant director, and the facilities official then sought to help the human resources official find a job for her brother.
Both the son and the niece of the senior adviser to the deputy assistant attorney general for human resources were hired for posts on the finance staff and human resources staff, the report says.
Also, the report says both the nephew and the cousin of the human resources director were hired to the National Security Division and the budget staff, respectively.
The 100-page report also says the probe revealed the common practice of hiring friends and relatives of Justice Management Division employees for paid summer clerkships and paid internships.
The inspector general noted the 2008 report had recommended "remedial ethics training and the establishment of a zero tolerance policy" for future violations of this type.
The report scolds Mari Barr Santangelo, who was responsible for implementing the recommendations and taking necessary actions. Investigators said she had made only "limited inquiries"
"In sum, we believe that there were management deficiencies in Santangelo's supervision of hiring practices in (the Justice Management Division) and we refer this report to (the division) for the action that it deems appropriate," the report says.
Cabell-Edelen has retired. Others involved who remain with the Justice Department could face disciplinary action ranging from reprimands to removal, according to department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
In a brief response, the department vowed to "move immediately to address the report's findings."
"The attorney general and deputy attorney general have made it very clear to Justice Department Management leadership that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated, that the department must maintain a zero tolerance policy, and that swift and decisive action must be taken to deal with those involved in these activities," it said.
But nobody has to worry about jail time. The inspector general found insufficient evidence that any criminal statutes had been violated, Talamona said.
The report notes that in September 2010, a former Justice Department employee told Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, chairman of the Justice Appropriations subcommittee, that the improper practices were continuing. He passed the information to the inspector general, triggering the latest investigation.

New York demands documentary footage on Central Park Five case
By Chris Boyette, CNN
updated 2:44 PM EDT, Fri October 5, 2012
Emmy-winning filmmaker Ken Burns says he is a journalist and is protected by New York's shield laws.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New York's demand stems from an attempt to defend against lawsuits
The filmmaker says he is fighting the city's request
The so-called Central Park Five case dates back to 1989
(CNN) -- New York City is demanding that documentary filmmaker Ken Burns hand over footage of the movie he made about five men who were wrongfully imprisoned and later exonerated for the rape of a woman in Central Park.
The demand is part of the city's attempt to defend itself against multi-million dollar federal lawsuits filed by some of the "The Central Park Five," as the exonerated men had come to be known.
Lawyers for New York City filed a subpoena demanding Burns and his production company, Florentine Films, give them the unpublished interviews and unreleased footage not used in the documentary, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May.
"The plaintiffs' interviews go to the heart of the case and cannot be obtained elsewhere," said Celeste Koeleveld, a city attorney.
In September 2002, protesters in New York demanded that the men convicted in the Central Park rape be exonerated.
But Burns, along with his daughter, Sarah Burns, and her husband David McMahon, who co-wrote and produced the film, say they plan to fight.
"I'm sorry to say we saw this coming," said Burns. "New York State shield laws are very specific. We are journalists, and that's what this is."
Burns was referring to state laws designed to protect journalists from having to compromise their sources. The filmmaker says he finds irony in the city's request for the footage because he says he and his crew had been trying to get city officials in front of the camera for interviews for years, but to no avail.
"We made every attempt, we practically begged to talk to prosecutors and police," he said.
The shield law should not protect Burns and his collaborators because they have shown many times that they were advocates and not journalists, city officials say.
For example, Sarah Burns worked for two years in the law firm of one of the plaintiffs' attorneys and Ken Burns wrote to Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009, urging him to settle the case, writing the plaintiffs had "suffered without just cause," the New York City law office says.
"Mr. Burns and his daughter have publicly sided with the plaintiffs and their families, who are seeking hundreds of millions from New York City," said Koeleveld, "The movie has crossed from documentary to pure advocacy. Under such circumstances, no reasonable person could have expected us to participate in their project."
Burns, an Emmy-award winning filmmaker, disagrees.
"We didn't make an advocacy film; we made a film about the facts of the case and that is these men were wrongly convicted, and had years of their lives stolen," Burns said. "One of the things that was stolen from these men was their humanity. In the media they were turned into wild beasts, a wolf pack, and we wanted to return their humanity. We'd have been happy to do the same to others involved, if prosecutors and police had returned our calls for interviews."
The racially charged Central Park Five case dates back to 1989.
On April 19 of that year, a 28-year-old white Wall Street investment banker was jogging through Central Park when she was brutally assaulted, raped and left for dead. That same night a group of black and Latino boys had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people, "wilding" as it was called in the media at the time.
2003: Central Park jogger speaks out
In the ensuing months, the investigation lead to the arrest of five of the boys. They were charged and convicted. To many it seemed like an open and shut case. Four of the young men had given taped confessions, and despite defense claims the confessions were coerced, the prosecutors, police, and what seemed like much of the American public deemed them guilty.
Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kharey Wise and Kevin Richardson were convicted and sentenced to prison.
In 2002, three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer, confessed to the crime and said he acted alone.
DNA analysis later determined that Reyes did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match.
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, ordered a new investigation and, on his recommendation, a judge vacated the convictions.
Legal expert say the city may have a case.
"The evidence exists, the tapes and footage exists, and these people are suing the city, so you can see why the city would want to use them," said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffery Toobin.

Canadian child-killer's release draws outrage
By Paula Newton, CNN
updated 9:50 PM EST, Thu December 13, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Canadian doctor who stabbed his children freed from mental hospital
Cardiologist Guy Turcotte confessed, served 46 months Children's mother, also a doctor, says she wants answers
Jury found Turcotte not responsible because of mental illness
Montreal, Canada (CNN) -- Canadians expressed outrage Thursday after the release of Guy Turcotte, a cardiologist who in 2009 confessed to killing his children as they slept in their beds.
What many wanted to know was how a father who stabbed his children dozens of times could be free after 46 months of confinement. Those voices echo the grief of Turcotte's ex-wife, Dr. Isabelle Gaston, the mother of 5-year-old Olivier and 3-year-old Anne-Sophie.
As Gaston pored over her children's autopsy reports, she wished she had no idea what they meant. But as a physician and a coroner, she knows it's true: Her children suffered a long, gruesome death.
"I knew it was not a short death. You know, my little boy received 20 stabs of a knife, he had seven marks of defense," she told CNN in an interview at her home before Turcotte's full release. "He had no wound that was the one that gave him death," she added, trying to hold back tears.
"My little girl, she had 19 wounds, maybe she was luckier? Because she had one that was more mortal than the other. But she felt 19 shots, that's for sure," Gaston said.
Turcotte confessed to killing his children in February 2009 but a year later a Canadian jury failed to convict him of the murders, finding him not criminally responsible due to mental illness.
At trial, Turcotte testified that he was distraught over his crumbling marriage and snapped, insisting he blacked out and doesn't remember killing his children.
The jury believed the testimony of two psychiatrists paid for by his defense. They testified that Turcotte could not have known what he was doing when he repeatedly stabbed his children.
"Why don't I accept that he is mentally ill is when I look at the facts," Gaston said. "We have a person that is a cardiologist that never had a psychiatric incident, not at all. I have trouble to understand how someone in five hours or six hours will do an interview of someone and have a conclusion that he is not a danger to society or is mentally insane."
Even the Canadian government has weighed in, calling Turcotte's release "unacceptable."
"We believe that Isabelle Gaston does not deserve to live in fear of her children's killer and neither do victims of similar crimes across Canada," said James Moore, a federal cabinet minister.
The Conservative government of Prime Minster Stephen Harper is drafting legislation to make it more difficult for mentally ill offenders to be released from psychiatric facilities, but the pending legislation is not expected to influence Turcotte's case.
In fact, Turcotte told the psychiatric review board that released him that he is looking forward to leading a normal life in the future and hopes to practice medicine and have children again.
"To know that my children faced the person that they should have trusted the most and they were left by themselves to die. No one holding their hand," Gaston said. "I struggle, OK, I struggle all the days, every day of my life and I think till I die I will struggle."

Minesweeper lifted from Philippine reef
By Brad Lendon, CNN
updated 12:22 PM EDT, Sat March 30, 2013
The stern of the USS Guardian, the last piece of grounded ship, is removed by a crane vessel on Saturday, March 30. The U.S. Navy minesweeper became trapped on a reef off the western Philippine island of Palawan on January 17. The Navy has pledged to clean up debris and restore the reef as much as possible.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The grounded U.S. Navy minesweeper was removed from a Philippine reef Saturday
The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters of the reef
The USS Guardian ran aground on January 17
(CNN) -- The Guardian is gone. What was left of the former U.S. Navy minesweeper was lifted off a Philippine reef on Saturday.
"The stern was lifted around 1:50 p.m.," Philippine Coast Guard Palawan District head Commodore Enrico Efren Evangelista told the state-run Philippine News Agency.
It was the last of the four sections of the wood and fiberglass hull the USS Guardian had been cut into in the effort to remove it from where it ran aground on January 17.
Bow cut from U.S. ship
The 250-ton stern segment was placed aboard a waiting barge.
"As the hull has been removed, the team is now shifting their effort to collecting minor debris that remains on the reef," the head of the salvage operation, Navy Capt. Mark Matthews, said in a statement.
"We also have a collaborative team from the U.S. and the Philippines beginning to assess the condition of the reef."
The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral, as well as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds.
The Navy has pledged to clean up the debris created when waves stripped off pieces of fiberglass covering the wooden hull of the ship and to try to restore the reef as much as possible.
"(With this complete) the second phase which is the assessment and recovery phase (for the damaged reef) begins," Evangelista said.
"Every salvage operation presents unique challenges. It has been difficult to extract the Guardian without causing further damage to the reef, but the U.S. Navy and SMIT salvage team with support from other companies and the government of the Philippines have really done a superb job. I could not be more proud," Matthews said. "We continue to work closely with the Philippine Coast Guard, Navy and Tubbataha Reef Park Rangers, and we are grateful for the support we have received to remove Guardian and minimize further damage to the reef."
An investigation into the grounding is ongoing, but Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles.
While the removal of the stern from the reef may visually mark the end of the Guardian, the ship was officially stricken from the U.S. Navy registry in February. Navy communications now refer to it as the Ex-Guardian. It has been replaced in the Pacific by the USS Warrior, which arrived at the U.S. naval base in Sasebo, Japan, earlier this month. The Guardian's crew will take over operation of the Warrior.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hotel restaurant nominations came from six continents
Hotels had to have at least 15 rooms to be included on The Daily Meal's list
Experienced food writers and critics voted on the list of nominations
(CNN) -- They're hardly known for exciting dining. Historically, they've been a last-ditch option driven by fatigue and convenience.
But hotel restaurants have come a long, long way.
The Daily Meal's list of 101 Best Hotel Restaurants Around the World was announced Tuesday. To be considered, the hotels had to have at least 15 rooms, and the restaurant had to be part of the hotel. (Restaurants just a few feet from the hotels didn't make the cut.)
The top spot went to é by José Andrés at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. The United States had 20 restaurants on the list, with Las Vegas taking three spots in the Top 10.
"It's no news that Las Vegas today has many of the best, most exciting restaurants in America -- especially on the upper level of dining," said Colman Andrews, The Daily Meal's editorial director, via e-mail. "We know many people who now go to Las Vegas primarily to eat and relax, never setting foot in a casino except to pass through on the way to the next great meal."

Europe dominated the list with 26 restaurants, while North America came in second place (with 20 restaurants from the United States and five from Canada). Asia and the Indian Ocean/Pacific Ocean regions had 24 venues on the list, while the rest of the world followed: Caribbean/Central America, nine; South America, five; Africa, nine; and the Middle East, three.
Andrews and travel editor Elsa Säätelä chose nominees on six continents, including more than 50 countries and more than 80 cities. They invited 12 experienced food writers and bloggers, restaurant critics and other lifestyle writers -- who also got to nominate their favorites -- to vote anonymously for their top picks.
"We did not discriminate on location; no island, nation, or province was off the table," Säätelä said in a statement.

Pseudomembranous colitis
Filed under: Digestive Health
Pseudomembranous colitis is inflammation of the colon that occurs in some people who have taken antibiotics. Pseudomembranous colitis is sometimes called antibiotic-associated colitis or C. difficile colitis. The inflammation in pseudomembranous colitis is almost always associated with an overgrowth of the bacterium Clostridium difficile. Severe pseudomembranous colitis can be life-threatening. However, treatment is usually successful. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis include: Diarrhea that can be watery and sometimes bloody
Abdominal cramps and pain
Fever
Pus or mucus in your stool
Nausea
Dehydration
Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can begin within one to two days after you begin taking an antibiotic, or several weeks after you discontinue taking the antibiotic. When to see a doctor
Contact your doctor if you're taking or have recently taken antibiotics and you develop any of the signs or symptoms associated with pseudomembranous colitis, including constant diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood or pus in your stool.

Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Causes
Pseudomembranous colitis occurs when harmful bacteria in your colon — usually C. difficile — release strong toxins which irritate the colon. Harmful bacteria are normally kept in check by the healthy bacteria in your digestive system, but the balance between healthy and harmful bacteria can be upset by antibiotics and other medications. Virtually any antibiotic can cause pseudomembranous colitis. Antibiotics most commonly associated with pseudomembranous colitis include: Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and levofloxacin (Levaquin)
Penicillins, such as amoxicillin and ampicillin
Clindamycin (Cleocin)
Cephalosporins, such as cefixime (Suprax)
Other causes
Although antibiotics are the drugs most associated with the development of pseudomembranous colitis, other medications may be responsible. Chemotherapy may sometimes disrupt the bacteria within the intestines of people being treated for cancer and trigger the development of pseudomembranous colitis. It can also develop in people with diseases that affect the colon, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. C. difficile spores are resistant to many common disinfectants and can be transmitted from the hands of health care professionals to patients. Increasingly, C. difficile has been reported in people with no known risk factors, including people with no recent health care contact or use of antibiotics. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of pseudomembranous colitis include: Taking antibiotics
Staying in the hospital or a nursing home
Increasing age, especially over 65 years
Having a weakened immune system
Having a colon disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer
Undergoing intestinal surgery
Receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer

Complications
By the time your doctor detects pseudomembranous colitis, you may already be seriously ill. If the condition isn't successfully treated when diagnosed, a number of complications can develop, including: Abnormally low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia), due to the loss of potassium during excessive diarrhea
Dehydration leading to abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension), related to significant loss of fluids and electrolytes due to diarrhea
Recurrence of pseudomembranous colitis, days or even weeks after initial treatment
Kidney failure, due to severe dehydration resulting from diarrhea
A hole in your bowel (perforated colon), which can lead to an infection of your abdominal cavity
Toxic megacolon, a rare but serious swelling of the colon, leaving it incapable of expelling gas and stool, which could cause your colon to rupture
Most people respond well to treatment. But pseudomembranous colitis can be fatal without effective treatment. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Preparing for your appointment
Based on your signs and symptoms, you may be referred to a specialist in digestive diseases (gastroenterologist). If your signs and symptoms are severe, you may be directed to emergency medicine. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor. What you can do Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions, including restricting your diet or not taking certain medications.
Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.
Make a list of your key medical information, including the names of all medications that you're currently taking or that you've taken during the last month or so. Your doctor will also want to know about other conditions for which you've recently been treated, including any procedures or hospitalizations.
Take a family member or friend along to help remember things.
Write down questions to ask your doctor.
Some basic questions to ask your doctor include: Questions to ask your doctor What is likely causing my symptoms?
Are there any other possible causes for my condition?
What kinds of tests do I need?
Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
What is the best course of action?
I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
Is there anything I can do to prevent a recurrence of this condition?
If my symptoms do recur, what treatment options will be available?
Don't hesitate to ask questions any time that you don't understand something. What to expect from your doctor
Be ready to answer questions your doctor may ask: During the last several weeks, have you taken antibiotics, had a surgical procedure or been hospitalized?
Is anyone at home sick with diarrhea, or has anyone at home been hospitalized in the last several weeks?
Have you ever been diagnosed with diarrhea related to C. difficile or antibiotics?
Do you have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease?
Have you traveled recently to areas with an unsafe water supply?
When did you first begin experiencing signs and symptoms?
Have your symptoms stayed the same or gotten worse?
Are you having abdominal pain?
Do you have diarrhea? Is there blood or pus in your stools? Do you have a fever?
What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?
Are you being treated for any other medical conditions?
What you can do in the meantime
While you're waiting for your appointment, drink plenty of fluids and stick to bland foods to help you cope with diarrhea. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Tests and diagnosis
Tests and procedures used to diagnose pseudomembranous colitis include: Stool sample. Tests of one or more stool samples often can determine whether C. difficile is present in your colon.
Blood tests. They may reveal an abnormally high white blood cell count (leukocytosis), which may indicate pseudomembranous colitis.
Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. In both of these tests, your doctor uses a tube with a miniature camera at its tip to examine the interior of your colon for signs of pseudomembranous colitis. If you have pseudomembranous colitis, the exam may show raised, yellow plaques (lesions) in your colon, as well as swelling.
Imaging tests. Your doctor may obtain an abdominal X-ray or an abdominal CT scan if you have severe symptoms to look for complications such as toxic megacolon or colon rupture.

Treatments and drugs
Treatment for pseudomembranous colitis often begins with stopping the antibiotic medication that's thought to be causing your signs and symptoms. Sometimes, this may be enough to resolve your condition or at least ease signs, such as diarrhea. Switching to a different antibiotic
If you still experience signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend an antibiotic that is effective against C. difficile or other bacteria in your colon. Although it may seem strange to use antibiotics to treat a disorder caused by antibiotics, treatment with different antibiotics to eliminate C. difficile allows the normal bacteria to grow back, restoring the balance of bacteria in your colon. The antibiotics used to treat pseudomembranous colitis are usually given by mouth. However, you may be treated with these drugs intravenously or through a tube inserted through your nose and threaded into your stomach (nasogastric tube). Once you begin treatment for pseudomembranous colitis, signs and symptoms may begin to improve within a few days. Treating recurring signs and symptoms
Even in people who are treated successfully, pseudomembranous colitis can return weeks to months after treatment has been completed. In these cases, treatment options may include: More antibiotics. You may need a second or third round of antibiotics to resolve your condition.
Surgery. Surgery may be an option in people who have progressive organ failure, rupture of the colon and inflammation of the lining of the abdominal wall (peritonitis). Surgery typically involves removing a portion of the colon (partial colectomy).
Fecal replacement therapy. Healthy stool, usually from a close relative or member of your household, is homogenized and then inserted into your colon. The donor stool can restore the balance of healthy bacteria in your colon. Fecal replacement is a new therapy that has been used successfully at Mayo Clinic.
Preventing recurrences If you've experienced multiple episodes of pseudomembranous colitis that haven't responded to treatment with antibiotics, you may opt to try: Probiotic treatment. Probiotics are concentrated supplements of good bacteria and yeasts that come in capsule or liquid form. You take these supplements by mouth. It's thought that the bacteria in the supplement travel to your colon to help fight the bad bacteria. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Lifestyle and home remedies
To cope with the diarrhea — and subsequent dehydration — that can occur with pseudomembranous colitis, try to: Drink plenty of fluids. Water is best, but fluids with added sodium and potassium (electrolytes) also may be beneficial. Avoid beverages that are high in sugar or contain alcohol or caffeine, such as coffee, tea and colas, which can aggravate your symptoms.
Choose soft, easy-to-digest foods. These include applesauce, bananas and rice. Avoid high-fiber foods, such as beans, nuts and vegetables. If you feel your symptoms are improving, slowly add high-fiber foods back to your diet.
Eat several small meals, rather than a few large meals. Space the smaller meals throughout the day.
Avoid irritating foods. Stay away from spicy, fatty or fried foods, and any other foods that make your symptoms worse.
