Excerpt: O'Connor led the court on abortion Story Highlights Sandra Day O'Connor was Supreme Court's guiding voice on abortion in 1990s A Goldwater Republican, she was embraced by conservatives Vetting process for court didn't catch her moderate stance on abortion rightsNext Article in U.S. » By Jeffrey Toobin All this week CNN.com is running excerpts from CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin's new book "The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court" published by Random House. When it came to abortion rights, even at the start of the 1990s, the Rehnquist Court was in fact the O'Connor Court. Author Jeffrey Toobin is CNN's senior legal analyst. After blazing through Stanford Law School and graduating in 1952, Sandra Day O'Connor did not receive a single job offer as a lawyer. (The major Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher said she could come to work as a legal secretary.) But O'Connor ignored the slights, as became her custom, and concentrated instead on building a life with her new husband, John. He graduated from Stanford Law a year after she did, and following his Army stint in Germany, they settled in the booming but still very small city of Phoenix, Arizona. The next years passed in a blur, which was the pace of life O'Connor preferred. She had three boys in six years. She worked first at a small law firm, then as an assistant attorney general. She volunteered for local hospitals and the Salvation Army and worked her way up the hierarchy at the Junior League. She and John, who became a successful lawyer himself, hosted lively barbecues for dozens of people (often including Bill and Nan Rehnquist) at their adobe home in Paradise Valley. Once, according to her biographer Joan Biskupic, the O'Connors staged a campy dedication party for a bridge they had built over their backyard pool. Men wore top hats and tails, with white shorts and sneakers, and women sported gowns and pith helmets. Boiled beef, potatoes, and English muffins were served, and bagpipes provided accompaniment. Much later, in her chambers at the Supreme Court, O'Connor would demand that her law clerks replicate her own headlong style of living. Marriage, children, career, exercise, culture, politics, volunteer work -- she had done it all and everyone else should, too. Female clerks were required to join in her three-mornings-a-week exercise class at the court gym. (Late in her tenure, she added salsa dancing to the workouts.) Male clerks planning weddings were ordered to get in shape. (One stuffed an ice cream cone in his desk drawer so she wouldn't see it.) Clerks dozing from exhaustion would be instructed to join her at special private showings at the National Gallery. Don't Miss 'The Nine ...' Toobin's new book
Excerpt: Conservatives win back the court Toobin on the new term
An annual clerks' picnic by the cherry blossoms in the Tidal Basin would (and often did) take place even in the rain. For O'Connor, even holidays were occasions for exertion. For Halloween, she demanded that her clerks decorate a pumpkin with a newsy theme. After 9/11, there was "Osama Bin Pumpkin"; a year later, a Martha Stewart pumpkin -- wearing prison garb. The formative political event of O'Connor's years in Phoenix took place in 1969, when her local state senator moved to Washington to take a job in the Nixon administration. Though she had been an assistant attorney general for only four years -- and women politicians were still a novelty -- she persuaded the governor, Jack Williams, to appoint her to fill the seat. O'Connor took to legislative work immediately, building coalitions, making deals, pushing bills through the process. The job suited her personality. She got along with people and liked to get things done. O'Connor came of age when Barry Goldwater dominated the Arizona Republican Party -- and she supported him for president in 1964 -- but her work in politics never had a particularly ideological edge. Fittingly, one of the first bills she sponsored was to repeal a 1913 law that prohibited women from working more than eight hours a day. To O'Connor, this was paternalism, not protection. O'Connor took the same pragmatic approach to the subject of abortion, displaying the kind of artful political tacking on the issue that she would show on the court. She had taken office when a drive was on to change abortion laws in the state legislatures, and Arizona was no exception. At the time she became a senator, Arizona law prohibited abortions except to save a woman's life, and the following year, 1970, a liberalization bill came before a committee where O'Connor served. On April 29, 1970, according to local newspapers, she voted to end criminal prohibitions on abortions in Arizona. The measure passed the committee but never came up for a vote of the full Senate. While she supported that pro-choice measure, she also backed a restriction on abortion rights, in the form of a law that would have allowed only licensed physicians to perform abortions. Shortly after O'Connor became majority leader of the Senate, Roe v. Wade made these initial rounds of legislative approaches moot; abortion would be legal regardless of what the state legislatures did. In Arizona at least, since the right to choose abortion was now protected by the U.S. Constitution, the issue faded from the state's immediate political agenda. In a curious postscript, O'Connor's record on abortion rights was a focus of the vetting process when President Reagan was considering naming her to the court in 1981. O'Connor told the vetter, a young Justice Department aide named Kenneth Starr, that she had never cast a vote on the abortion liberalization measure. Starr took her word for it, and no one else thought to check the Phoenix papers for a record of her vote. (The scrutiny of Supreme Court nominees became much closer in later years.) The omission allowed O'Connor to assure the Reagan team that she "personally" opposed abortion at the same time as she left a studied ambiguity about how she felt about the legal status of abortion rights. In truth, it seemed, O'Connor never gave abortion rights a great deal of attention as a legislator. To the extent she thought about abortion, she tried to steer a middle course between extremes on the issue -- an approach that would remain her touchstone in the infinitely higher-stakes setting of the Supreme Court.

Let's see Tea Party deliver on civil rightsBy Roland S. Martin, CNN Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTSRoland Martin says Tea Party spokesman claimed civil rights high ground in recent debateTea Party's criticism of NAACP would surprise civil rights groups, he saysHe challenges Tea Party to address racial profiling, education, "don't ask, don't tell"Martin: Tea Partiers have talked the talk on civil rights, now they should walk the walkEditor's note: Roland S. Martin, a CNN political analyst, is a nationally syndicated columnist and author of "Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith," and the new book, "The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House." He is a commentator for TV One Cable Network and host of a Sunday morning news show. (CNN) -- While Glenn Beck continues to pathetically assert that he is a modern day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his listeners and viewers are the rightful heirs to the Civil Rights Movement he spearheaded, it may catch some by surprise that Tea Party leaders claim their movement is also one that is about advancing the civil rights of Americans. During a debate I participated in Wednesday night on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, Tea Party Express spokesman Mark Williams -- who moonlights as a radio talk show host -- blasted the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People for not doing anything to fight crime in the inner city, as well as for advancing issues that go against the U.S. Constitution. I had to do everything I could to maintain my composure, considering that the NAACP's long and storied history has been about forcing Americans to actually uphold the Constitution and apply it evenly to all citizens, especially African Americans. Yet as Williams continued his tirade, I really did want to hear exactly what civil rights issues he and other Tea Party members are fighting for. I'm sure they would come as a surprise to civil rights organizations, the folks who are on the frontlines every day. Video: Where's the racial harmony?

Video: NAACP's message to Tea Party
I asked Williams if he would be willing to sit down and meet with the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and other civil rights organizations to find common ground on various civil rights issues. His response? Attend the more than 70 Tea Party rallies in the fall as a participant. Yeah, right. So with my suggestion in mind, it would be great for Williams, Sarah Palin and other Tea Party leaders, advocates and supporters, especially those candidates receiving their backing in November, to clearly state their position on some of the civil rights issues of the day (The following are not in a particular order of importance). Education. President Obama and the Democratic establishment are against the notion of school vouchers. Republicans have advanced the issue for years, yet in Illinois it was GOP members who could have made the difference in vouchers being offered to students who attend schools that rank at the bottom in Chicago. State Sen. James Meeks (who also is founder/senior pastor of Salem Baptist Church of Chicago, Illinois, where I'm a member), fought hard to pass the measure. He was rebuffed by a lot of folks in the Democratic Party, but also a number of Republicans. While we all wait for the day when our public education is fixed for the have-nots, will the Tea Party make education a civil rights issue and demand that students in the worst schools be allowed to leave via vouchers? And will it also fight to equalize funding across the board for those inner city schools that are unable to compete with suburban schools? Racial profiling. There is nothing more insidious and unconstitutional than police officers pulling folks over or frisking them based on nothing in particular, except the color of their skin. Numerous cities and states have documented this horrible practice. The NAACP is gearing up to advance a federal anti-racial profiling bill. Will Mark Williams and the Tea Party join them in an effort to say no more to this hideous practice? Voting rights. The right to vote is at the heart of our democracy, and it's shameful to watch members of both political parties use archaic rules to prevent folks from voting. We have seen voters with no history of criminal activity purged from voting rolls. It's time that we have consistent rules nationally and not be subject to various state, county and city rules. As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the Bush vs. Gore decision, there is no affirmative right to vote in the United States. Our Constitution forbids minorities and women being disenfranchised (It's interesting to note that basically white men can be denied the right to vote, depending on how you look at this). In Chicago, if you move from one address to another, you are automatically removed from the voting rolls. Why not have your voting rights follow you to a new address? We have a driver's license that is legal in all parts of a state, why not the voting card? To fix the overlapping and confusing rules, it's time we amend the Constitution and establish a clear and affirmative right to vote. Tea Partiers, are you willing to support that? Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. has had such a bill ready to be voted on for nearly a decade. "Don't ask, don't tell." Tea Partiers claim they are all about the U.S. Constitution, that they are patriots. OK, fine. How crazy is it for someone who is gay to be kicked out of the U.S. military solely because of his or her sexuality? The right wing has made a major effort to keep gays and lesbians from serving openly, and the left has fought to have the measure repealed. If the blood of a homosexual flows the same on the battlefield as that of a heterosexual, then what's the problem? Mark Williams, is this the kind of civil right you and the Tea Party support or oppose? Leading a 21st century Poor Peoples Campaign. At the time of his assassination in 1968, Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference were planning the Poor Peoples Campaign, set for Washington, D.C., to show the plight of poverty in America. Today, we have Republicans in Congress who are against a jobs bill and extending unemployment benefits, but are ardent supporters of keeping the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. Will the Tea Party put the concerns of America's poor at the forefront of its movement? The Civil Rights Movement wasn't just about those at the top, but the downtrodden, disenchanted and ignored. I haven't heard Tea Partiers talking about the least of those among us. So, Mark Williams, will we see Tea Partiers descend on the nation's capital to demand that lawmakers stop ignoring the nation's poor? It's easy for Williams and other Tea Partiers to casually toss out assertions that they are fighting for the civil rights of Americans. Fine, but put your money where your mouth is. It's time to call the Tea Party Express together at the table with the civil rights establishment to forge a comprehensive civil rights strategy headed into the midterm elections and 2011. Saying it is one thing, Tea Partiers, but doing it is another. You've talked the talk, now it's time to walk the walk. So what say you?

FBI: We want Unabomber's DNA in 1982 Tylenol case By the CNN Wire Staff Unabomber DNA sought in Tylenol caseSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: A new DNA sample is sought because of forensic advances, FBI saysSeven people died in 1982 after taking cyanide-laced TylenolThe FBI says Ted Kaczynski has not agreed to provide a voluntary sampleKaczynski claims he has agreed to provide the sample on one unspecified condition (CNN) -- Authorities want to take DNA samples from "Unabomber" Ted Kaczynski in connection with their investigation into the 1982 incident in which seven people died after taking Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide, according to the FBI office in Chicago. "As part of the re-examination of the 1982 Tylenol poisonings, the FBI attempted to secure DNA from numerous individuals, including Ted Kaczynski," said Cynthia Yates, FBI spokeswoman. "To date, Kaczynski has declined to voluntarily provide samples." However, in a handwritten motion filed in federal court aimed at stopping the online auction of possessions taken from his Montana cabin in 1996, Kaczynski writes that he did agree -- with a condition -- to provide the sample. Read Kaczynski's motion Kaczynski, 68, killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995. The FBI dubbed him the "Unabomber" because of his early targets -- universities and airlines. He was arrested in 1996, pleaded guilty in 1998 and is now serving a life term in the federal "Supermax" prison in Florence, Colorado. Yates would not comment on whether federal authorities already have a DNA sample from Kaczynski or when the request for his DNA was made. "It would have been standard procedure for DNA to be taken from Kaczynski as an inmate in a federal prison," said Traci Billingsley, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Prisons. But she could not say precisely when Kaczynski's DNA was taken in the past, and had no information on the FBI's request for a new sample. "The standards on DNA testing have changed over the years, so forensic examiners would want a fresh sample," said Chicago FBI spokesman Ross Rice. He said he did not know whether the original sample was kept or not. Unabomber DNA sought in Tylenol case

Mark Collins, a spokesman for the "Supermax" prison, would not comment on the DNA issue, saying it was "not a matter of public record." On April 27, Kaczynski writes in the motion filed May 9, prison officials told him that "the Chicago office of the FBI wanted a sample of my DNA to compare with some partial DNA profiles connected with a 1982 event in which someone put potassium cyanide in Tylenol. The officers said the FBI was prepared to get a court order to compel me to provide the DNA sample, but wanted to know whether I would provide the sample voluntarily." Kaczynski said he asked for time to think about it, and said he later sent a written response to prison officials saying he would provide the sample voluntarily "if the FBI would satisfy a certain condition that is not relevant here." Rice said he had no knowledge of what Kaczynski's condition might be. "I have never even possessed any potassium cyanide," Kaczynski said. "But even on the assumption that the FBI is entirely honest (an assumption I'm unwilling to make), partial DNA profiles can throw suspicion on persons who are entirely innocent. For example, such profiles can show that 5%, or 3%, or 1% of Americans have the same partial profile as the person who committed a certain crime. "If it happens by chance that I fit one of the partial DNA profiles that the FBI has in relation to the 1982 cyanide incident, then it will be not only to my advantage, but to the advantage of society in general, to resolve correctly the question of any putative connection between me and the cyanide incident. For this purpose, some of the evidence seized from my cabin in 1996 may turn out to be important," and the auction should not go forward, he writes. A similar motion was also filed in district court, according to court documents. "Kaczynski has not been indicted in connection with the Chicago Tylenol investigation, and no such federal prosecution is currently planned," federal prosecutors said in a response to the motion. "Consequently, there is no basis for an order interfering with the sale previously approved by the district court, as directed by the court of appeals." Absent a judge's ruling on the motion, the auction launched as planned Wednesday. Bidding for a handwritten copy of Kaczynski's 35,000-word manifesto, which ultimately led to his capture, stood at more than $12,000 as of Thursday. In 1982, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide. The deaths prompted a national scare as several drug chains pulled Tylenol off their shelves and people in several cities were hospitalized on suspicion of cyanide poisoning. In an October 1982 article, Time magazine quoted Dr. William Robertson, then director of the Poison Control Center in Seattle, as saying, "If it was going to be a lethal dose, you wouldn't have time to call." Johnson & Johnson, parent company of the McNeil drug maker, was widely credited for its aggressiveness in recalling the product and its transparency in dealing with the deaths, and the product quickly bounced back in sales, remaining a popular analgesic. The incident led to changes in the way over-the-counter drugs were packaged, as tamper-proof seals were instituted. The case was never solved. In February 2009, the FBI announced it was working with Illinois state and local police to review evidence related to the killings. "The review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity. Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence." Tylenol spokesman Bill Price declined comment on the Kaczynski matter Thursday. About 60 items are featured in the online auction of Kaczynski's possessions, including clothing, books, photographs and documents. Proceeds from the sale will benefit four of his victims who sought restitution and were awarded $15 million. Kaczynski vehemently opposed the auction and fought a court battle to prevent it. The auction runs through June 2 at gsaauctions.gov.CNN's Shawn Nottingham, Carol Cratty and Georgiann Caruso contributed to this report.

Immigrant seeks legal status after court victory By Mariano Castillo, CNN Juana Villegas was awarded $200,000 in a lawsuit against Tennessee. STORY HIGHLIGHTSJuana Villegas sued a sheriff's office for violating her rightsDeputies had her shackled before, during and after giving birthA jury this week awarded her $200,000Now she wants a permission to live and work in United States (CNN) -- An illegal immigrant who this week was awarded $200,000 in a lawsuit against a Tennessee sheriff's office will ask a federal judge to grant her permission to remain in the United States legally, her attorney told CNN. A jury on Thursday awarded Juana Villegas the damages in a civil case against the joint government of Nashville and Davidson County in which she alleged that county sheriff's deputies violated her rights when they shackled her while pregnant, while in labor and during her postpartum recovery. She had initially filed suit against federal officials, but the judge dismissed that part of the case Now, her attorney, Elliott Ozment, says that he will ask the judge who oversaw the case to grant his client a U-visa, a special status that can be conferred on victims of crimes who are in the country illegally. The U-visa would allow Villegas -- a Mexican national -- to live and work legally in the country for three years, and can be renewed for another three years, Ozment said. During that period, she can adjust her status and become a legal citizen. It's a long shot, as a U-visa has been awarded by a federal judge only one time before. Usually, they are conferred by other immigration authorities. "We think the level of misconduct has risen to such a high level that she deserves a U-visa for what she suffered," Ozment said. "She has been the victim of a terrible, terrible wrong." Consideration of Villegas' fate comes as the Department of Homeland Security announces its intention to individually review roughly 300,000 pending deportation cases in federal immigration courts. Lower-priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- will be suspended. Villegas' story begins on July 3, 2008, when she was nine months pregnant and driving home with her three children from a doctor's appointment in metro Nashville. A police officer pulled her over and, according to Villegas' complaint, decided to arrest her for driving without a license because the officer suspected she was in the country illegally. The decision to arrest her was influenced by a controversial agreement between the police department and the federal government that allowed local officers to help enforce immigration laws, known as section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. She was transported to a detention center, where two days later, she went into labor. According to court documents, Villegas was taken to Nashville General Hospital where she was placed on a gurney with her hands and feet shackled. Once in her hospital room, two Davidson County sheriff's deputies refused to leave the room while she changed into her hospital gown, and unplugged her phone so she couldn't alert her husband about her labor, court documents say. Afterwards, one of the deputies shackled her left foot and right hand to the hospital bed, something that the medical staff called a "barbaric" violation of medical standards, court records state. The shackles were finally removed before she delivered the baby. "During the trial she testified about how she was afraid for the safety of her baby," her attorney, Ozment said. "She didn't know what to expect. She didn't know what was going to happen." After she had delivered the baby, and against doctor's orders, a third deputy shackled her to the bed again, according to the court documents. The sheriff's department's policies that led the deputies to shackle her throughout the ordeal were a violation of the U.S. and Tennessee constitutions, her lawyers argued. In April, U.S. District Judge William Haynes ruled in favor of Villegas, and after a three-day trial this week, the jury set the $200,000 award. Villegas' lawyers had asked for $1.2 million. Villegas also sued the U.S. government, alleging that she was wrongly arrested under the program. That lawsuit was dismissed. Villegas had once been deported from San Diego and returned illegally into the United States, and had lived here for years, her lawyer said. At the time of her arrest, her eldest son was 14, and he had been born in the United States.

Cruise ship's cook says captain ordered dinner after crash
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 1:37 PM EST, Fri January 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The cruise company says the woman accompanying the captain boarded Friday
Cook: "We really felt something was wrong"
The ship's captain ordered dinner after the collision, the cook says
"I wasn't that scared, but I did wonder ... what the captain was doing," the cook says
Lea este artículo en español/Read this article in Spanish
(CNN) -- The captain of the Costa Concordia ordered dinner for himself and a woman after the ship struck rocks off Italy's coast, a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station.
In an interview with GMA Network, cook Rogelio Barista said Capt. Francesco Schettino ordered dinner less than an hour after the accident.
"We wondered what was going on. ... At that time, we really felt something was wrong. ... The stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realized how grave the situation was," Barista told GMA.
Schettino ordered dinner around 10:30 p.m. Friday, Barista said. Authorities say the ship struck the rocks at 9:41 p.m.
"I have had 12 years of experience as a cook on a cruise ship. ... I have even witnessed fires, so I wasn't that scared," Barista said. "But I did wonder, though, what the captain was doing ... why was he still there."
Search and rescue inside Costa Concordia
Cook: Captain ordered dinner amid chaos
Limited legal options for cruise victims
Italian media have published photos of the woman purportedly dining with the captain.
Costa Cruises, which owns the ship, said the woman boarded the ship Friday and registered.
"The company is ready to provide the authorities, when requested, with the identity of the person and the number of the ticket purchased," the company said.
The ship hit rocks off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio on Friday night.
At least 11 people are known to have died in the disaster, and 21 are still missing, according to the Italian Crisis Unit.
There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely.
Criticism from both Costa Cruises and the authorities has focused so far on Schettino, who is under house arrest and facing possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship.
Coast guard records published Thursday by an Italian newspaper pile further pressure on the captain of the Concordia and his officers, suggesting authorities first became aware of the crash from a friend of the mother of a passenger about 15 minutes after the ship hit rocks.
Schettino's brother-in-law defended him in an Italian newspaper Thursday.
Schettino "managed to avoid a tragedy -- it could have been worse," Maurilio Russo said in Corriere della Sera.
And he denied that the captain had abandoned ship.
"He was not running away, he came down (from the ship) to survey the damage," Russo said.
CNN's Armie Jarin-Bennett and Hada Messia contributed to this report.

Pro marathoner: I'll run Boston again
By Sheri Piers, Special to CNN
updated 5:41 AM EDT, Wed April 17, 2013
Flowers are left on Newbury Street, a few blocks from where two explosions struck the Boston Marathon finish line.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sheri Piers, a pro runner, ran the Boston Marathon on Monday for her eighth time
Piers says we can't let this tragedy taint the marathon or let whoever did it win Piers feels no sense of accomplishment; she says most runners want to forget race
Piers will run the Boston race again but will always remember what happened Editor's note: Sheri Piers is a professional runner who came in as the second master's finisher and 20th woman overall in Monday's Boston Marathon. Last year, she was 10th overall and the first American to cross the finish line. She is a nurse practitioner and lives in Falmouth, Maine.
(CNN) -- I ran my eighth Boston Marathon on Monday, the day the bombs went off. We cannot let this terrible tragedy taint this amazing international event or let whoever was behind this evil act win. That's why I will run it again.
Marathoners are tough-minded and can endure discomfort for long periods of time. They enjoy running to push themselves and often run with others and make friends along the way. Some are highly competitive, like me, and enjoy the long, hard journey to get into marathon shape before the race.

After all that training, the Boston Marathon is usually a very happy day that results in a joyous sense of accomplishment. But today, most runners are probably feeling as I do: disgusted, saddened, angry and depressed.
The race feels surreal, almost as if it didn't happen, and as if a whole lot of training and hard work amounted to nothing. I don't think one participant can walk away from that marathon and feel glad. Most people say they want to forget it because of all the sadness and loss.
On the day of the marathon, I had set out to Hopkinton, Massachusetts, where the race begins, to start in the elite women's field, which begins 30 minutes ahead of the remaining waves.
As I was standing on the starting line and looking at the thousands of people around me, I was struck by a terrible and unusual thought: "Today's venue would be an opportune time for someone to hurt a lot of people." It passed, the gun went off, and I was on my way to Boston.
This was an especially exciting year because it was the first time my three children, who are 13, 11 and 10, came to watch mommy run the Boston race. As I concluded the race, the second master's finisher and 20th woman overall, I was immediately escorted back to the Fairmont Copley Hotel where my family and I were staying.

Boston remembers the bombing victims
We were sitting around discussing the race, and the first explosion went off. Then the next. We all looked at each other wondering what that could have been -- with a gut-wrenching feeling, we realized it had to be bad. Sirens were wailing, and the streets were full of commotion.
Panicky texts were coming in fast from family and friends, asking if we were all safe, sending information about the two bombs that went off at the finish line. Our TV was turned off: Someone had told me to keep it off to spare the kids the gory details. The hotel went into lockdown for the next five hours, and our fear grew.
We couldn't help but think of all the people involved, the people who were killed and injured, their families, the volunteers, the first responders, the medical personnel and the runners. We wondered how race director Dave McGillivray was doing. He has the respect of the whole running community for all he has done to make the Boston Marathon so special and memorable for everyone involved.
My kids keep saying, "What kind of an idiot would do something like this? Who would do this? What do you think they are feeling about what they did right now? Are you scared to run the Boston Marathon again, Mommy?"
Runners will continue to participate in the Boston Marathon -- but it may take years for the fear to go away completely. I love running this marathon and will continue to do it. But next time I run down Boylston Street to the finish line, I will think of all the people injured and the ones who lost their lives for nothing. And I think my children have seen their mom run the Boston Marathon for the first and last time.

House approves budget deal aimed at averting shutdown
By Deirdre Walsh. Dana Bash and Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 9:30 PM EST, Thu December 12, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The House approves a compromise budget plan on a 332-94 vote
House Speaker Boehner criticizes conservative groups that oppose the deal
NEW: Bill expected to pass the Senate, but margin could be razor thin
The proposal would cut the deficit and ease some sequester cuts
Washington (CNN) -- A compromise federal budget plan that would remove the threat of a government shutdown for two years won easy approval Thursday from the Republican-controlled U.S. House.
The deal worked out by House Budget Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray passed on a 332-94 vote and now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, which is expected to approve it next week in a very close vote.
It represented rare convergence between the two parties on government spending after two years of bitter debate and political brinksmanship that included the 16-day shutdown in October.
A White House statement said the measure does not include everything President Barack Obama called for, but "it marks an important moment of bipartisan cooperation and shows Washington can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done."
Public anger over the Washington dysfunction, especially with conservative Republicans who triggered the shutdown by trying to link federal spending to their efforts to dismantle Obamacare, motivated GOP leaders to shrug off far right opposition to the budget compromise.
A small step
House Speaker John Boehner acknowledged the measure amounted to only a small step toward the GOP goal of deficit reduction and balancing the budget, but he rejected opposition by some conservatives in his caucus as well as outside groups on the political right.
"Is it perfect? Does it go far enough? No, not at all," Boehner said in urging his colleagues to back the plan, noting it resulted from "doing what the American people expect us to do -- coming together and finding common ground."
Ryan noted that Washington politicians have "been at each other's throats for a long time" over budget issues, and Republicans must first win some elections in order to get all the deficit reduction and spending cuts they want.
Democrats also hailed the budget proposal as a "small positive step forward," in the words of Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.
He and other Democrats called for Congress to also extend long-term unemployment benefits for more than 1 million Americans set to expire after Christmas, but their support for the budget plan showed they dropped any demand to link the issues in Thursday's vote.
In the House vote, 169 Republicans voted for the spending plan while 62 opposed it, with 163 Democrats in favor and 32 against. While most Republicans supported the plan, Boehner needed help from Democrats to get the 217-vote threshold needed for passage.
Top GOP Senate aides said they expect the budget to pass the Senate but it could be by a razor thin margin. This could also change if momentum against the bill grows.
GOP conservatives including Ted Cruz of Texas, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they will oppose the measure, which would need some Republican support for Democrats to overcome an expected filibuster.
"The new budget deal moves in the wrong direction: it spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare," Cruz said. "I cannot support it."
Graham and Ayotte said they opposed cuts to pension benefits for some military veterans under the spending plan.
Escalated criticism
Boehner earlier escalated his criticism of such opposition from conservative colleagues and outside groups in a rare public display of a longstanding rift between the GOP tea party wing and less extreme establishment Republicans.
To Boehner, groups such as Americans for Prosperity lost credibility by rejecting the plan before it was announced, he told reporters.
He also blamed the influential outside groups for pushing GOP legislators into the politically disastrous government shutdown in October.
"The day before the government re-opened, one of these groups stood up and said 'well, we never really thought it would work,'" he told reporters before animatedly asking: "Are you kidding me?"
The agreement reached by Ryan of Wisconsin and Murray of Washington would extend government spending into 2015 to remove the threat of another shutdown before next year's congressional elections.
It sets government spending at $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year that runs through September, and $1.014 trillion. Overall, it proposes to save $85 billion and would reduce the deficit by more than $20 billion.
Conservative complaints
Some conservatives complain the total is more than the level called for in the Budget Control Act that followed brinksmanship negotiations two years ago over raising the federal borrowing limit.
That 2011 deal imposed unpopular forced spending cuts known as sequestration on the military and other government programs.
The new compromise would eliminate $45 billion from the next round of the sequester cuts that are set to hit in January, as well as another $18 billion scheduled for 2015.
Boehner noted it achieves more deficit reduction than the Budget Control Act, asserting it adhered to conservative principles of shrinking government and federal debt.
"I'm as conservative as anybody around this place," he said in defending his attacks on the outside groups, adding that "all the things we've done in the three years I've been Speaker have not violated any conservative principles, not once."
Asked why he spoke out now against the outside groups, Boehner said they crossed a line, adding that "when you criticize something and you have no idea what you're criticizing, it undermines your credibility."
White House support
The White House supports the compromise, but factions on both sides still pushed for change as the issue moved closer to decisive votes.
Liberal Democrats insist the budget plan should extend long-term unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the year. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said the issue would be considered separately in 2014.
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Congress should take up the unemployment insurance extension but did not insist that it be part of the budget package.
"We want them both and we think Congress ought to pass them both," Carney said.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel praised the agreement Thursday, saying provided certainty for military planning after the harmful sequester cuts and constant showdowns over spending.
"This agreement does not solve all (Department of Defense) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training, in particular, and procurement," Hagel said.
However, right-wing groups escalated their criticism of the plan.
"Time and again, Congress has claimed that cost-saving measures were permanent, only to later renege on these promises," said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots.
She took particular aim at Republican leaders such as Boehner, saying the deal "also exposes the true colors of several in the GOP establishment when it comes to protecting conservative principles."
Diminishing influence?
Boehner's comments to reporters were aimed at some of the same organizations that have effectively pressured House Republicans to resist compromising on budget issues in the past two years.
They include Americans for Prosperity, Club for Growth, Freedom Works, Heritage Action and the Koch brothers, GOP campaign financiers.
He made similar comments questioning the motives of some of the groups at a closed-door meeting this week with House Republicans.
The Speaker told members that "no one controls your voting card but you," according to a GOP source in the meeting.
Strong GOP backing for the budget compromise showed that conservatives and the outside groups that back them have diminished influence.
Rep. John Fleming, a conservative from Louisiana, said outside groups won't be able to sway as many conservatives because legislators like the idea of returning Congress to what's known as regular order -- deliberating and passing bills the way they're supposed to be done, instead of backroom deals reached amid crises.
However, GOP Rep Raul Labrador of Idaho, a critic of the budget plan, wondered what had changed among fellow Republicans who now rejected the thinking of the outside conservative groups.
Keeping score
The conservative groups keep scorecards on the voting records of legislators and back candidates who follow their policy stances with key campaign contributions. Such support can carry enhanced influence with congressional elections coming up next year.
Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action, didn't back down from his criticism of the budget deal.
"Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they've achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home," Holler said in a statement to CNN.

Part of complete coverage on
Make, Create, Innovate
Would you like to print out the weekly shopping in the comfort of your own home? Perhaps you're in the market for a new body part printed from your own cells? OK, you might have to wait a decade or two, but 3D printing technology is likely to change our lives forever.
3D printers deposit material layer by layer to create a solid object.
Because objects are constructed in layers from the ground up, the process is also known as additive manufacturing.
Plastic is currently the most common "ink," but others in use include ceramics, metal, sand, sugar and chocolate.
From intricate jewellery
and bespoke guitars,
to prosthetic limbs
and complex machine parts.
And this is only the beginning...
It could be the end of shopping as we know it.
Instead of going to the store to buy a toothbrush (or waiting for one to be delivered)...
You could buy the rights to the design and simply print one out at home.
You could design and print your very own from scratch.
Or instead of selecting from a range of mass-manufactured shoes.
In Amsterdam, a group of architects have built a 3D printer so big it's encased in the carcass of a shipping container.
The "KamerMaker" prints large Lego-like structures, made from recycled plastic, which will form the building blocks of a full-size canal house.
The pieces will be assembled on-site like a huge jigsaw, with steel cables and industrial-strength glue used to "sew" them together – room by room.
If you think a 3D-printed house is out of this world...
The European Space Agency is exploring plans to build lunar space stations using 3D-printed bricks made from moon dust.
Market share
Industrial applications already make up by far the largest market for 3D printing, where the process has been used for years to create model prototypes and, increasingly, specialized machine components.
3D printing makes it possible to manufacture interlocking parts, reducing need for assembly.
And, because they only use the exact material required, 3D printers could eliminate waste from traditional manufacturing -- in which up to 90% of raw material is discarded.
Market share
High-end, high-value industries such as aerospace, automotive and medical tech are likely to be the big spenders, using 3D printing to create objects with an internal complexity and precision that traditional factory machines can't match.
"Bioprinters" use a "bio-ink" made of living cell mixtures. Like other forms of 3D printing, living tissue is printed layer by layer.
First, a layer of cells is laid down by the printer, followed by a layer of hydrogel that operates as a scaffold; then the process repeats.
The cells fuse, and the hydrogel is removed to create a piece of material made entirely of human cells.
This is transferred to a bioreactor, where the tissue continues to grow - as it would in nature - into its final form.
While 3D-printed replacement organs are still some years off, scientists are already using this technique to print simple tissue, like skin and cartilage.
And of course, if we can print human tissue, there's nothing stopping us from printing animal flesh too.
Food for thought?
