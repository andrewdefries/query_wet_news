'Rockefeller' impersonator pleads not guilty to murder in California By Michael Martinez, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: "The evidence, we feel, is strong," a prosecutor's spokeswoman saysChristian Karl Gerhartsreiter ordered to be held without bailGerhartsreiter once claimed to be a RockefellerHe is charged in the death of John Sohus, whose remains were found in 1994 Alhambra, California (CNN) -- A California judge on Friday entered a not guilty plea on behalf of a German-born man -- known for impersonating a Rockefeller -- during his arraignment on a charge of murdering a man who went missing in the mid-1980s. Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, 50, is accused of killing John Sohus, who was 27 at the time of his 1985 disappearance. His dismembered remains were found nine years later as workers dug a backyard pool at a home his mother used to own in San Marino, California. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carlos A. Uranga ordered Gerhartsreiter to be held without bail. Gerhartsreiter is still serving a Massachusetts sentence for kidnapping his daughter; he was transferred from a prison in that state to California this week, authorities said. Shackled and wearing a blue jumpsuit, Gerhartsreiter was calm during Friday's arraignment. He wore eyeglasses and had a couple days' growth of facial hair. He answered the prosecution's questions with a steady "yes" and waived his right to a speedy trial. His next court hearing is set for August 16, when the court is expected to schedule a preliminary hearing. 2009: Rockefeller impersonator guilty

Gerhartsreiter, who has led a life of multiple identities, has denied any involvement in the Sohus case. At one point in his life, Gerhartsreiter assumed the identity of "Clark Rockefeller," a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job. A Boston tabloid dubbed him "Crockefeller." One of his attorneys, Jeffrey A. Denner of Boston, said he wasn't aware of any breaks in the 26-year-old case that would warrant a charge against his client. "I was personally surprised because there was so much time, and what new evidence could have arisen, we don't know anything," Denner said after Friday's arraignment. "Old case, new case -- he didn't do it. We maintain his innocence. He maintains his innocence." Spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office acknowledged the case has received much media attention. There has even been a Lifetime movie, "Who Is Clark Rockefeller?" starring Eric McCormack as Gerhartsreiter. "This case has been written about extensively," Gibbons told reporters. "We're happy that the defendant is here, and the process has started. "The evidence, we feel, is strong. Otherwise we wouldn't have filed the case" in March, she said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said he was "glad" that criminal proceedings were beginning. "Nothing is solved until the jury returns a verdict of guilty," Whitmore said. "We're satisfied we got the right person. We're at a point where we can put this issue to rest. It's been a long time coming." Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian told the court he was going to provide 83 CDs, DVDs and videotapes to defense attorneys. There are also 9,000 pages of investigative documents that authorities will provide to Gerhartsreiter's attorneys, Denner said. "They've had 26 years to put it together and there's a lot of information," Denner said after the hearing. The murder victim's wife, Linda Sohus, has never been found. Except for a few postcards that appeared to have been mailed by the couple from Paris in 1985, her friends and family have not heard from her. Her disappearance is still under investigation, Gibbons said. Gerhartsreiter has been serving a four- to five-year sentence in Massachusetts for kidnapping his 7-year-old daughter in 2008. That prison term will expire in mid-2012, authorities said. Gerhartsreiter will receive credit for that Massachusetts sentence while being incarcerated in California, authorities said. Gerhartsreiter came to the United States from Germany in 1978, according to testimony at his trial for kidnapping. After spending a few years in Connecticut, he moved to Wisconsin, where he married in a green card arrangement using his true name. Gerhartsreiter then relocated to California. He settled in San Marino, a wealthy community near Pasadena, where he lived under the name of Christopher Chichester from 1983 to 1985. He posed as a film student and boasted that he was of English royalty, according to Vanity Fair magazine, which profiled him in January 2009 and quoted several people who knew Chichester at the time. As Chichester, he rented a guest house from Ruth "Didi" Sohus. Her son John and his wife, Linda, came to live with Didi Sohus during the time Gerhartsreiter lived in the guest quarters. It is unclear what his relationship was with the couple. Didi Sohus told investigators she believed that her son and daughter-in-law were in Europe. She filed a missing person report in July 1985, according to the Pasadena Star-News. Didi Sohus and one of Linda Sohus' friends received postcards postmarked from Paris in mid-1985, purportedly from the couple, but investigators were suspicious of their authenticity. Sohus sold the house in late 1985 after suffering a stroke. She died three years later. Through luminol testing of the guest quarters where Chichester lived, investigators found what appeared to be a large amount of blood. (Luminol causes a glow when it comes in contact with blood.) It is not clear when the luminol testing took place, but police thoroughly searched the house when the remains were found and again after Gerhartsreiter's arrest in the kidnapping case. A former neighbor quoted by Vanity Fair reported that Chichester borrowed a chain saw from him at about the time the couple went missing. An acquaintance, Dana Farrar, said she "saw an area of dirt that had obviously been dug up and filled in" at the time, according to the Pasadena Star-News. When she asked him why, Chichester told her he was having plumbing problems. Sheriff's detectives from Los Angeles County sought Chichester for questioning in early May 1985, but he had disappeared in a pickup truck registered to John Sohus. He resurfaced under yet another identity -- that of Christopher Crowe -- in Connecticut in the late 1980s. In late 1988, Crowe tried to sell Sohus' pickup truck to a man in Connecticut. When he couldn't produce the proper paperwork for the truck, the prospective buyer reported him to police. Connecticut police soon learned that Chichester and Crowe were the same person, although at that time, no one knew that his true name was Gerhartsreiter. Crowe disappeared before police could question him. He resurfaced in Manhattan in 1993 as Clark Rockefeller. On May 5, 1994, workers digging in the backyard of the San Marino home to install a swimming pool for the home's new owners discovered three plastic bags containing the skeletal remains of a man who wouldn't be identified until 2010. The investigation heated up again when authorities learned shortly after the 2008 kidnapping that Gerhartsreiter was not Clark Rockefeller. He was arrested in Baltimore, where he was hiding out with his daughter. He had already assumed a new identity: a ship's captain named Chip Smith who, with his daughter Muffy, was relocating to Chile. His second wife, Harvard-educated financial executive Sandra Boss, testified that she spent more than a dozen years with him before growing suspicious that Rockefeller was not who he said he was. They met in New York City and were married in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Their daughter, Reigh, was born on May 24, 2001, and her father nicknamed her "Snooks." The couple divorced in 2007 after Boss hired a private investigator to conduct a background check, according to testimony at the kidnapping trial.

Intelligence chiefs say al Qaeda is weaker, but still a threat From Pam Benson, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSCIA Director Petraeus makes his first appearance before Congress as a civilianPetraeus says middle-level al Qaeda figures in Pakistan might be heading elsewherePetraeus, National Intelligence Director Clapper say the al Qaeda threat continues Washington (CNN) -- Al Qaeda is weakened but remains a significant threat to the United States, the nation's top intelligence officials told a congressional committee Tuesday. CIA Director David Petraeus, the former military commander in Afghanistan who made his first congressional appearance as a civilian at the rare joint hearing by the intelligence committees of the House and Senate, said al Qaeda is far weaker today than it was 10 years ago, at the time of the 9/11 attacks, because of the killing of Osama bin Laden and other successful attacks on leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan. According to Petraeus, the "heavy losses to al Qaeda senior leadership appear to have created an important window of vulnerability for the core al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan," and the United States will need a "sustained focused effort" to exploit the opportunity. Petraeus called bin Laden's long-time deputy and successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, a "less compelling" leader who will have more difficulty that bin Laden "in maintaining the group's cohesion and its collective motivation in the face of continued pressure." "Some mid-level leaders and rank-and-file al Qaeda members may increasingly seek safe haven across the border in Afghanistan or decide to leave South Asia," Petraeus said, adding that "even in decline, with its core leadership having sustained significant losses, al Qaeda and its affiliates still pose a very real threat that will require" continued U.S. focus and dedication "for quite a while." He called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Yemen-based affiliate, the most dangerous of al Qaeda's various "nodes," citing the group's two nearly successful attacks on the United States: the December 2009 attempt to blow up a Northwest airliner as it approached Detroit and the cargo bomb plot of 2010. Petraeus labeled Somalia "one of the world's most significant havens for terrorists," saying Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate there, is large and well-financed and is training hundreds of foreign fighters, including some Americans. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also took part in the hearing, agreed that despite U.S. successes against it, al Qaeda remains a threat. He pointed to the terror concerns over this past weekend regarding a possible plot timed to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. "Terrorists still wish to do us harm, to destroy our institutions and to kill Americans without conscience," he said.

How the search for aliens can help sustain life on Earth
By Charles Cockell, Special to CNN
updated 6:35 AM EDT, Thu October 4, 2012
Searching for alien life on Earth and other planets like Mars (pictured) could help solve environmental issues, says a UK scientist.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Astrobiology is the study of the origins and evolution of life on Earth and in space
Astrobiologists examine microbes on Earth to understand the possibility of life elsewhere
Exploring inhospitable parts of our own planet and others can bring practical and economic benefits to humans
Billions of dollars spent exploring space will help provide answers to environmental issues
Editor's note: Charles Cockell is Professor of Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh and Director of the UK Centre for Astrobiology. He was a National Academy of Sciences Associate at the NASA Ames Research Centre and received his PhD from the University of Oxford. He is author of "Space on Earth: Saving Our World by Seeking Others," which proposed a fusion of space exploration and environmentalism.
(CNN) -- It would be easy to criticize the burgeoning science of astrobiology as an intellectual endeavor best left to more profligate times. The search for extraterrestrial life and expeditions to hunt for life in Earth's extremes -- from the bottom of the oceans and Antarctica's extremes -- seem like luxuries for excitable explorers and space scientists.
The enthusiasm about alien life isn't new; the ancient Greeks wondered whether there were other habitable worlds. But it is only recently that the search for extraterrestrial life has been underpinned by experiments -- telescopes to search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, rovers, like NASA's Curiosity, to hunt for life on Mars.
Charles Cockell
In wanting to better assess whether life could be elsewhere, astrobiology has also set out on the more homely tasks of understanding how life evolved on the Earth, how life has persisted on our own planet for over three-and-a-half billion years and how it manages to thrive in extremes that to humans seem completely inimical to life.
"Astrobiology is a bridge between understanding our Earth and exploring space and it reminds us that both endeavors are not merely linked, but basically one and the same challengeCharles Cockell, University of Edinburgh
In uncovering the secrets of life's survival on the Earth, astrobiology has some found remarkably prosaic applications. The powder that works in your washing machine at high temperature functions because it contains proteins extracted from microbes that grow in volcanic hot springs.
They were first found by scientists (who would today call themselves astrobiologists) seeking to know how life adapts to such primitive, searing surroundings.

Yet, some of the most promising locations to search for ancient life on Mars are places where water may have been in contact with volcanic rocks, ancient hydrothermal systems where conditions may have been conducive to life.
As astrobiologists dig and scrape in amongst the microbial inhabitants of Earth's most hostile environments to understand the possibility of life elsewhere, they learn things that have economic uses.
The link between the search for extraterrestrial life and our Earth-based problems is not surprising, because fundamentally it is all the same thing -- understanding how life, whether us or microbes, can be sustained in the cosmos. A hypothetical microbe on Mars might need to adapt to live in a high temperature stream. A human on Earth needs to find a way to clean its washing at high temperature.
Both are trying to make a living on a planetary surface and both are trying to do this as efficiently as possible without wrecking their living conditions. Both might find that they can share a common way of accomplishing these things.

It isn't uncommon to find environmentalists who are in awed disbelief that we can be spending billions searching for life on Mars and space explorers who feel that a focus on environmentalism narrows the reach and vision of our civilization. Both groups of people are separately emboldened by their vision.
"We are confronted by a future with a single challenge -- build sustainable human settlements in the cosmos, whether on Earth or in spaceCharles Cockell, University of Edinburgh
Environmentalists understand the great challenges that lie ahead in dealing with a population of seven billion apes inhabiting a piece of rock a mere 12,500 kilometers in diameter; space explorers understand that if they achieve their vision, and establish a permanent human presence beyond the Earth, they will not only open new opportunities for knowledge and resources, but they will also enhance our civilization's long term chances of survival.
Now, more than at any time, we need a unified vision. Astrobiology is a bridge between understanding our Earth and exploring space and it reminds us that both endeavors are not merely linked, but basically one and the same challenge.
By exploring the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and beyond we learn things of practical benefit to living on Earth and settling space.
Once we see how environmentalism and space settlement are linked, we no longer stand peering into a future where we have to grapple with an either/or choice: settle space or save the oasis of Earth -- or indeed a future where we have two enormous challenges to juggle both at once.
Instead, we are confronted by a future with a single challenge -- build sustainable human settlements in the cosmos, whether on Earth or in space.
The science that generates the knowledge that underpins this, astrobiology, becomes a glue between these two communities and offers us the chance to become the space-faring guardians of an oasis in space.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Cockell

Internet providers to begin warning customers who pirate content By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 2:11 PM EDT, Wed October 24, 2012 | Filed under: Web
The Center for Copyright Information says a new system will warn users when accounts are used to illegally download content.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A new warning system will let people know they are illegally downloading content
First, the Internet providers will try to educate people about how to get content legally
Customers could eventually face punishments such as a slowed Internet connection
The Copyright Alert System has been four years in the making
(CNN) -- It is about to get a bit more difficult to illegally download TV shows, movies or music online.
A new alert system, rolling out over the next two months, will repeatedly warn and possibly punish people violating digital copyrights. The Copyright Alert System was announced last July and has been four years in the making.
If you use AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, or Verizon as your Internet service provider, you could receive the first of one of these notes starting in the next two months.
The Internet provider is delivering the message, but the legwork is being done by the copyright owners, which will monitor peer-to-peer networks such as BitTorrent.
They use a service called MarkMonitor, which uses a combination of people and automated systems to spot illegal downloading. It will collect the IP addresses of offenders, but no personal information. The IP addresses are turned over to the Internet providers, which will match up the address with the right customer and send the notification.
The warning system is described as a graduated response. First the Internet provider will let the customer know that their Internet connection is being used to download content illegally. The note will include information to steer them away from their life of crime, including tips on how they can download content legally.
There will also be tips on securing Internet connections, just in case you were unaware that your neighbor was downloading season three of "Dexter" using your unprotected wireless network.
"The progressive series of alerts is designed to make consumers aware of activity that has occurred using their Internet accounts, educate them on how they can prevent such activity from happening again," the CCI said in its announcement today.
After the educational phase, the customers will be asked to acknowledge that they received the warning. If they continue to download content illegally, the alerts will threaten mild punishments, such as forcing the copyright violator to read "educational materials," or throttling their Internet connection so that it is slow, making it harder to download large files.
Today's announcement claims that terminating the Internet service is not one of the options.
If a customer feels they are being wrongly accused, they can ask for a review, which will cost them $35 according to the Verge.
The entire system will be overseen by an organization called the Center for Copyright Information, which includes content owners, such as the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America, as well as individual members including Disney, Sony Pictures, Fox, EMI and Universal.
Each ISP will have a slightly different version of the system.

Defrocked minister: Same-sex wedding was an 'act of love' for son

Methodist minister says he performed son's gay wedding
He says denying that request would have been denying the love he's shown his son
Frank Schaefer was defrocked after a jury of 13 clergy found he'd violated church doctrine
(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania Methodist minister who was defrocked this week for performing a same-sex wedding said Friday he felt compelled to break church doctrine because it was an "act of love" for his son.
When Frank Schaefer's son was in his teens, he was suicidal, torn by sadness that the church would think less of him for being gay, Schaefer said Friday on CNN's "New Day."
When their son told his parents he was gay, the Schaefers recognized his pain and chose to embrace him. "My wife and I said, 'Look, there's nothing wrong with you. This is the way you were created,' " Schaefer said on "New Day."
"Obviously, he didn't choose this because he prayed to God to make him, quote-unquote, 'normal.' And when that didn't happen, he really went through this crisis," the minister explained.
Years later, in 2007, Schaefer's son asked his father to perform his wedding.
"For me, to say no to him ... it would have denied everything we ever told him in terms of affirmations and love that we gave him," Schaefer said.
The minister knew that performing the ceremony was going to stoke the ire of his superiors and that it was against church doctrine. So he was upfront with church officials. He told them.
For six years, he didn't hear a word about the incident. Then, apparently, someone in the church filed a complaint about him this year.
On Thursday, the minister at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in the small town of Lebanon was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, church officials said.
The verdict came after a jury of 13 clergy members determined in November that the minister had been disobedient to the discipline and order of the church.
After that determination came a 30-day suspension. The church asked Schaefer to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the gay community would prevent him from fully complying with church law, according to a statement from Bishop Peggy Johnson of the United Methodist Church.
The church told him that he could retain his standing if he never performed another same-sex wedding again.
Schaefer refused, telling the Board of Ordained Ministry that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it is discriminatory.
That prompted the church to ask Schaefer to immediately surrender his credentials.
He refused again, forcing church officials to defrock him.
Losing his job shook the minister.
"Actually, I was in shock," he said on "New Day." "I didn't realize it right away, but my wife told me, when we were in the car, she said, 'Look at your hand,' and I looked at it. I was shaking."
"It really hit me harder than I thought," he continued. "Look, I mean, six, seven years ago, I was ready to give up my career for my son. I never thought this would ever come back after that long of a time, so I went on ministering. I'm a pretty effective minister, so I never thought it would come to this. And especially not to the kind of attention that this has gotten nationwide."
The incident had received media attention across the globe.
His son was recently interviewed, saying that he feels guilt for what has happened to his father, Schaefer said.
"I always tell him, 'Don't feel guilty about this. This really had nothing to do with you.' This is based on the exclusionary policies of the church. That's what causes this. We just have to stop the discrimination in the church."
The minister said that his views on homosexuality have evolved over the years.
At one point, he believed that it was a sin. But when he went through seminary, he learned about "different interpretations" of scripture that addressed homosexuality.
"By the time my son came out, I would describe myself as tolerant," he said.
But eventually, he became a "silent supporter" of his son, and once someone complained about the performance of his son's wedding, he decided to be vocal and open about his feelings.
His church is divided, he said, and he's lost friendships. It has been a "painful process."
But he wants to remain in the Methodist Church and work for change from within.
He said he has already filed an appeal and hopes to become reinstated to the Methodist clergy.
Schaefer's case will be reviewed by the appeals committee of the United Methodist Church's northeast jurisdiction. It could also go to the judicial council, which is equivalent to the supreme court of the church, according to Schaefer's attorney, Bill Ewing.
The attorney expects the appeal to be heard in 2015.
