Crew wins deadly pirate battle off SomaliaStory Highlights North Korean crew recaptures hijacked vessel Navy says two pirates killed, five captured; three from crew injured USS Arleigh Burke enters Somali territorial waters to pursue other pirates Pirates aboard hijacked Golden Nori carrying highly flammable benzene Next Article in World » Read VIDEO CHART MAP (CNN) -- The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates who hijacked the vessel off Somalia, but not without a deadly fight, the U.S. Navy reported Tuesday. The USS James E. Williams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says. When the battle aboard the Dai Hong Dan was over, two pirates were dead and five were captured, the Navy said. Three wounded crew members from the cargo ship were being treated aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS James E. Williams. The captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel, the Navy said. The bandits had seized the ship's bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines, the Navy said. The Koreans moved against the attackers after the Williams -- responding to reports of the hijacking -- ordered the pirates to give up their weapons, according to the Navy. When the crew members stormed the bridge, the deadly battle began. After the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured. North Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations. Watch why the U.S. helped the North Koreans » Don't Miss Pirate attacks increase worldwide
The incident took place about 70 miles northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the Navy said. It is the second incident of piracy reported in recent days. A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said. Over the weekend, gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian-flagged Golden Nori off the Socotra archipelago near the Horn of Africa, said Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for the Kenyan-based Seafarers' Assistance Program. The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates after entering Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said Monday. In recent years, warships have stayed outside the 12-mile limit when chasing pirates. Two military officials familiar with the details confirmed the ongoing operation. The Navy's pursuit of the pirates began Sunday night when the Golden Nori radioed for help. The Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to the Golden Nori's stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel. When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene. U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive. Benzene, which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen, is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said. U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia, where a U.N.-backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near-anarchy. See how piracy is worse than 2006 » On Monday, the head of the transitional government resigned as his administration -- backed by Ethiopian troops -- battled insurgents from the Islamic movement that seized control of Mogadishu in 2006. Hospital officials reported 30 dead in three days of clashes on the city's south side. In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore. See the warning area » The pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency. "To date, vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding, while those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment, often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks," the warning advised. The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking. E-mail to a friend CNN correspondents Barbara Starr at the Pentagon and Christian Purefoy in Nairobi contributed to this report.

Procrastination pays off for some summer travelersStory Highlights Great deals are plentiful for those who've procrastinated on summer travel plans L.A. to Barcelona for $299: This one's been snatched up, but more like it may follow Mexico resorts woo as country struggles to get back on tourism map Weekend getaways and road trips are increasingly popular ways to escape Next Article in Travel » By Jessica Ravitz CNN	(CNN) -- Procrastination rarely looks this good. People gather in Barcelona, Spain's Park Guell, a garden with architectural designs by Antoni Gaudi. With summer upon us, those who've put off making travel plans -- out of economic fear, guilt or otherwise -- may come out ahead as airlines, hotels and resorts continue to roll out screaming-good deals. On Wednesday morning, for example, Delta wowed even the most savvy of shoppers, offering round-trip flights from the United States to Europe in the low $200s up to the $400 range, fares that were more than half off where they were just hours before. "We haven't seen a sale like this in, oh ... well, ever, really," wrote George Hobica, creator of Airfarewatchdog.com, in a note he blasted off to media under the subject head "historic." Granted, those jaw-dropping deals -- such as one from Los Angeles, California, to Barcelona, Spain, for $299 -- were snatched up pronto, but Hobica said others like them "could return at any moment" and suggested people sign up for e-mail and Twitter alerts from his site, Airfarewatchdog.com, and his competitor, Farecompare.com. Travel industry insiders point out that now more than ever people are looking for travel packages that are surprise-free, the more all-inclusive the better. And given the state of the economy and industry, it's as if the vacation stars have aligned in the consumer's favor -- especially if the shopper is willing to be flexible on dates. It's a "perfect storm" for those looking for rooms, said Jan Freitag, a vice president of Smith Travel Research, which monitors the hotel industry. Because the industry had done well in recent years, he said "everyone and their brother" scrambled to get loans and open new hotels. Just as demand has dropped, with people scaling back on travel expenditures, the availability of rooms has soared. So far this year, Freitag said, the average occupancy rate in U.S. hotels is less than 53 percent. Don't Miss Mexico's battered image yields travel deals

Layoff worries keep many from taking vacations

As a result, he said the most recent crunched figures, which were from April, show that room rates across the United States fell from the previous April by 10 percent overall and by about 16 percent at luxury locations. "It's definitely a buyer's market," Freitag said, and it is the right time to ask -- if these add-ons aren't already offered -- for free breakfasts, room upgrades and, for example, free access to a property's gym. Resorts, too, should and are ponying up plenty of perks. Seek out those free spa treatments, meals and rounds of golf, suggested Rich Beattie, executive editor of TravelandLeisure.com. One hot spot for deal seekers is Mexico, which is struggling to reclaim its place on the tourism map. In the aftermath of the H1N1 flu virus scare, vacation destinations there "were just brutalized," said Beattie. As a result, resorts in places such as Cozumel and Cancun are slashing package prices by as much as 50 percent, CNN reported late last month. Meantime, said Hobica of Airfarewatchdog.com, flights to Mexico and Caribbean destinations, which are generally more affordable this time of year anyway, are even more enticing because of even greater prices and because the airlines are waiving the need to buy tickets in advance in order to secure the best rates. Navigating the deals and best steals can be overwhelming, which is why turning to a travel agent for help can make a difference. A travel agent, for example, can sift through all the options, often secure different packages and can help prospective travelers figure out what destination is best for them. "If you go to a professional, they can tell you what the traditional prices are ... and give you some good old-fashioned advice," said Ruthanne Terrero, a vice president in charge of content at The Travel Group, which puts out publications and Web sites for travel professionals. Money and savings aside, the importance of getting away from the daily grind, even for a couple days, doesn't fade away during tough economic times. Beattie said he's seen a surge of interest in weekend escapes. Likewise, the road trip is getting good play. Mark Sedenquist, the publisher and managing editor of RoadTrip America, a Web site for all things, well, road trip, said the road trip experienced "a renaissance in America after 9/11." And though interest took a dip later, if traffic on his site is any indication, he said a new resurgence is emerging this year. iReport: Share your road trip stories One person who's gearing up for a long drive is Caroline Duguay, 23, of Montreal, Quebec, in Canada. She created a Facebook group page called "Road Trip," so enthusiasts can swap tips, offer and find rides and thereby help the environment. "It's just an easy eco-friendly way of traveling," said Duguay, who plans on hitting for the first time the West coast of the United States, mostly California, where her boyfriend wants to surf. Theoretically, if it weren't for having a job, she could load up the car tomorrow and leave -- a perfect option for those who haven't planned.

UN: North Korea facing hunger because of grain deficit By the CNN Wire Staff Many North Korean children, like these shown with World Food Programme provisions in 2005, battle malnutrition. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNorth Korea will import far less than what it needs to feed its people, agencies sayUN agencies are urging international donors to make up the deficitFood shortages have been a problem in the communist nation
RELATED TOPICS
Food Security and Hunger
North Korea
United Nations World Food Programme
(CNN) -- About 5 million North Koreans will continue to face food shortages because of a grain deficit, two United Nations agencies warned Tuesday. North Korea requires 867,000 metric tons of grain to feed its people for the next 12 months but the government plans to import only 325,000 metric tons, according to a recent study by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme. The agencies are urging international donors to make up for the large deficit. Their report said representatives visited warehouses in seven of 10 provinces in the isolated communist nation. The warehouses contained "no cereal stocks while low quality maize available for distribution in October came from the summer harvest and, due to inadequate drying facilities, had excessive moisture content and contaminants," they said. Millions of North Koreans have gone hungry in recent years. They have reduced their food intake, and more children are consequently malnourished.

Tech Check: Steve Jobs biography, 'Unthinking' Facebook
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 4:04 PM EDT, Fri October 28, 2011 | Filed under: Web
On Tech Check, Doug Gross, Stephanie Goldberg and Brandon Griggs talk Steve Jobs biography, the anti-Facebook, Unthink.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Tech Check is the weekly podcast from CNN Tech
This week we look at not-always-shiny details from the new Steve Jobs biography
Will upstart Unthink take a bite out of Facebook? We break it down
Netflix earns the not-so-coveted Tech Fail of the Week award
(CNN) -- On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, Brandon Griggs and Stephanie Goldberg break down details from the new Steve Jobs biography.
The book, written by Walter Isaacson and released this week in the wake of Jobs' death, takes the reader behind the scenes of Jobs' rise to the top of the consumer-tech world, not always casting the Apple co-founder in a positive light.
We also look at Unthink, an upstart social-networking site that is trying to find a niche by being the anti-Facebook. Will calling Facebook, and rival Google+, "greedy giants" and adopting an anti-corporate approach, work? And what's up with that YouTube video?
Our Reader Comments of the Week come from our story on "Take This Lollipop," a viral Web video that uses your Facebook information to give the creepy, horror-inspired short film a personal twist.
And our Tech Fail of the Week goes to Netflix, which had some bad news to report this week after a couple of months of public-relations missteps the online movie-rental service would probably like to forget.
(Bonus: Wondering what tech-inspired Halloween costume Stephanie's donning this year? Of course you were. Tune in to find out!)

Small plane crashes in eastern Georgia, killing 5 From Dave Alsup, CNN
updated 5:59 PM EST, Thu February 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The crash sparked a fire and left nearby residents without power
The Hawker Beechcraft 390/Premier I jet had seven people aboard Two survivors were rushed to a hospital, sheriff says
(CNN) -- A small plane crashed in east Georgia on Wednesday night, killing five people, authorities said.
The light jet aircraft landed at Thomson-McDuffie Regional Airport in Thomson and ran off the end of the runway, said Kathleen Bergen, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman.
Two people survived the crash and were rushed to a hospital, McDuffie County Sheriff Logan Marshall told CNN affiliate WJBF. The flight took off from John C. Tune Airport in Nashville, Tennessee.
"It looks like it may have just overshot the runway, just barely missing a manufacturing building and crashing in the woods," Chief Deputy Ronnie Williamson told CNN affiliate WXIA.
The crash sparked a fire and left nearby residents without power.
"It was like a boom," resident Rhonda Bouthry told the station. "The power flickered on and off. It wasn't off but about 20 minutes."
The two cities are about 350 miles apart; Thomson is about 30 miles west of Augusta.
The aircraft was a Hawker Beechcraft 390/Premier I.

Embassies close as U.S. issues global travel alert due to al Qaeda threat
By Chris Lawrence. Barbara Starr and Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 10:27 PM EDT, Sat August 3, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The 22 U.S. embassies, consulates are closing
NEW: Committee of security heads reviews the situation
The State Department issues a global travel alert on possible al Qaeda attacks
Sources say al Qaeda is in final planning stages of unspecified plot (CNN) -- Hours before 22 U.S. embassies and consulates were to close for a day, top U.S. security officials reviewed the situation that led to the unprecedented move.
A U.S. global travel alert remained in place amid fears that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks.
The threat prompted the United States to announce that 22 facilities would be closed on Sunday, including in Yemen, which was a focus of concern.
A Saturday afternoon meeting included the White House chief of staff, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, as well as the heads of Homeland Security, the National Security Agency, the FBI and CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. President Barack Obama was briefed after the meeting, according to the White House.
On Saturday, the security around the U.S. embassy in Yemen was even tighter than last year when the embassy was raided by protesters. At least 12 tanks were stationed within 500 meters of the building.
Hundreds of additional security forces were deployed, and roads leading to the embassy were closed. Checkpoints were set up at a distance from the embassy, and trucks weren't allowed to pass anywhere near the main embassy road.
Yemen's special forces, the most elite, were seen in small numbers near the embassy, as well.
Meanwhile, Britain, France and Germany have said they, too, will close their embassies in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Sunday and Monday for security reasons. No other embassies are affected, they said.
Neither Italy nor Spain -- which has no embassy in Yemen -- planned to close any of their embassies.
The U.S. embassies closed on Sunday -- a day they would normally be open -- stretch across a swath of North Africa and the Middle East, from Mauritania to Oman. Bangladesh and Afghanistan, both majority Muslim nations, also are affected.
The U.S. government's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, said U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified.
Official: Security tightened in Yemen
"The threat appears to be much worse than it has (been) in a long time," said a senior national security official in Yemen, where the government is "on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come."
Various Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States -- are under threat, two U.S. officials said.
Three sources said the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack.
One of the sources said such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr, or the Night of Power, one of the holiest moments on the Muslim calendar.
Said one U.S. official: "It all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future."
What's behind timing of terror threat
Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told CNN he had never seen embassy closures ordered across such a broad area.
"There have been incidents where they've closed down a number of embassies in the Middle East because the information is not specific enough to say that 'embassy X' got to be closed as opposed to other embassies," said Hill, who joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1977.
"But I think this, closing all of these embassies in the Middle East to North Africa, is in fact unprecedented. At least, I didn't see this during my career."
'Leave Yemen now'
U.S. officials said that, based on intelligence, they were particularly concerned about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday. President Barack Obama, amid regular updates on the situation, has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans.
A White House official said the president was updated Saturday morning by Lisa Monaco, his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.
Obama, who departed for Joint Base Andrews to play golf, is being updated through the weekend, the official said.
He praised Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi for his country's efforts following a meeting Thursday at the White House.
The UK Foreign Office has also warned its citizens against travel to Yemen, and urged British nationals to leave as soon as possible.
"If you don't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying it is extremely unlikely that the British government will be able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance," it said.

U.S. troops led the investigation of the site of a suicide car bombing and a gunfight near the U.S. consulate in Herat, Afghanistan, on Friday, September 13. Taliban militants attacked the consulate using a car bomb and guns to battle security forces just outside the compound. An intercepted al Qaeda message led to the closing of 22 embassies and consulates across the Middle East and North Africa on August 4. Take a look at other attacks on U.S. diplomatic sites in recent years.
A suicide bomb goes off at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, on February 1. A security guard was killed and a journalist was wounded in the attack. The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C, took responsibility for the bombing. Demonstrators set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack.
People flee the scene of a Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on September 13, 2011. Three police officers and one civilian were killed. There were no reports of U.S. casualties.
Officials examine the aftermath of a terrorist attack outside the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan, on April 5, 2010. The coordinated attack involved a vehicle suicide bomb and attackers who tried to enter the consulate by using grenades and weapons fire. Two consulate security guards and at least six others were killed.
Yemeni soldiers carry the coffin of a comrade during a funeral on September 25, 2008, in Sanaa. Heavily armed fighters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Yemen on September 17. A car bomb was detonated, killing 10 Yemeni police and civilians and six attackers.
Relatives of slain police officers are comforted during a funeral in Istanbul, Turkey, on July 10, 2008, a day after the U.S. Consulate there was attacked. Three police officers and three attackers were killed in what the American ambassador to the country called "an obvious act of terrorism" aimed at the U.S.
A bomb squad team collects evidence at a construction site where a rocket was launched near the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Greece, on January 12, 2007. The anti-tank missile tore through the embassy, but there were no injuries.
A car exploded near the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, Syria, on September 12, 2006. Fourteen people were wounded. Syrian authorities killed three attackers and apprehended a suspect outside the building.
A U.S. diplomat and his driver were among at least four people killed on March 2, 2006, in an apparent suicide attack outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan.
An attack on the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, killed nine people on December 7, 2004. A Saudi group linked to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack. A Pakistani police officer stands guard outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi after a gunman opened fire there on February 28, 2003. Two police officers were killed, and six others, including one civilian, were injured. Family members of a victim who was killed by a bomb a day earlier embrace at a hospital in Denpasar, Bali, on October 14, 2002. A series of bombs killed more than 200 people at nightclubs while another attack occurred near the U.S. Consulate on the Indonesian tourist island. Authorities believe the attacks were coordinated.
A previously unknown militant group called Al-Qanoon claimed responsibility for a bombing that killed 10 people at the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, on June 14, 2002. The U.S. State Department says it suspects al Qaeda is responsible.
Police officers stand next to the body of a victim after a car bomb exploded on March 20, 2002, at a shopping center near the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru, killing nine people.
Christopher Sandrolini, the U.S. consul general in Calcutta, speaks with Indian officials outside the U.S. government information center in Calcutta, near the U.S. Consulate, where heavily armed gunmen killed five Indian police officers on January 22, 2002.
Rescue workers stand on the remains of a building in front of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on August 10, 1998, four days after a deadly attack. Twelve Americans were among more than 200 people killed in nearly simultaneous bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, center, walks past the damaged U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam on August 18, 1998. The August 7 attacks in Tanzania and Kenya were later attributed to al Qaeda.

Attackers set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack.

Photos: Attack on U.S. Consulate in Libya
It was unclear whether the apparent plot targets that Arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly, and why embassies from Bangladesh to Libya are being closed. Nor is the expected time of an attack known, which explains why the U.S. travel alert extends through August.
"Terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests," the alert states. "U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure."
New York Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called the information "the most specific I've seen."
While the principal attention is on the Arabian Peninsula, he stressed to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that "we can't rule anything out."
"We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace," King said.
22 embassies, consulates ordered closed
The State Department listed the 22 embassies and consulates that are closed Sunday, which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected.
The 17 affected U.S. embassies are in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Yemen. The U.S. Embassy in Israel will be closed as normal Sunday.
See the whole list
Consulates in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also being shut for the day. Embassies and consulates in the region typically close or operate with minimal staff on Fridays and Saturdays.
Potential terror threat in Mideast
Central Asia cause of embassy threat
CNN Explains: The Benghazi attacks
The shutdowns could extend beyond Sunday, a senior State Department official said.
Retired Gen. James Mattis -- who until earlier this year was head of U.S. Central Command, responsible for a 20-country area that includes the Middle East -- said the decision to close the embassies underscores the reality of the threat and the wisdom of U.S. policymakers.
U.S. embassies have been targeted before in places such as Yemen, Turkey and Tanzania, he pointed out. Moreover, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of the terrorist network's most active and most destructive branches.
"We have to remember that we're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women, children, diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets," Mattis told CNN on Friday.
Referring to the move by U.S. officials, he said, "They are showing some proactive discretion here, making certain that we don't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them."
Meanwhile, Canada shuttered for one day its diplomatic mission in Bangladesh on Saturday.
Questions, concerns after Benghazi
House leaders have been briefed, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided "some understanding of the seriousness of the threat."
King, who has also heard such briefings, applauded the government's decision to close its diplomatic missions.
"I give them credit," the Republican said of the Obama administration. "I think the government is doing exactly the right thing here."
Such bipartisan agreement in Washington comes at a time when politicians are still scrutinizing the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consular compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
Since then, Republicans have been pressing Obama's administration for answers, with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in Benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers.
Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration's inquiry to date has been "simply unacceptable," according to a draft letter obtained by CNN.
Earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden and senior State Department officials went to Congress to discuss embassy security.
Biden also briefed congressional leadership, key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns, a source who attended the meeting said.
Another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the Benghazi attack, which created a political firestorm for the administration.
On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps out of an abundance of caution.
CNN found embassy attack suspect before FBI
CNN's Greg Botelho, Michael Martinez, Jill Dougherty, Dana Bash, Evan Perez, Gloria Borger, Jim Acosta, Elise Labott, Mohammed Jamjoon, NuNu Japaridze, Bharati Naik, Karen Smith, Laura Smith-Spark and Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report, which was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.
