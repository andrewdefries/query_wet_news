U.S. offers up to $50 million for Mexican cartel membersStory Highlights U.S. authorities ratchet up the pressure on Mexico's notorious Gulf Cartel Federal indictment names leader, three other top players in drug cartel Plan to disrupt cartel: "Prosecute their leaders and seize their funding" Enforcement arm of cartel is known as Los Zetas; cartel operates in U.S. cities Next Article in Crime » WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. authorities have ratcheted up pressure on one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, releasing new details about the so-called Gulf Cartel's operations and offering up to a $50 million reward for the arrest of its leaders. These are weapons that the Mexican army said it seized from the ruthless Gulf Cartel in 2008. A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged Miguel Trevino Morales, a leader of the northern Mexico-based Gulf Cartel, of operating a criminal enterprise, cocaine distribution and firearms violations. Concurrently, prosecutors updated a separate indictment against three other top leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Antonio Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, for drug trafficking related crimes, all believed to be at large in Mexico. Fifteen other suspected cartel members are also named in that indictment. "We have learned that the most effective way to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations is to prosecute their leaders and seize their funding," Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement. To that end, the departments of justice, state and treasury are working together to place pressure on the Gulf Cartel and what authorities describe as its ruthless enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas. The Department of the Treasury designated the four top bosses named in the indictments as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, which authorizes the freezing of any assets they hold in the United States and other sanctions.

The Gulf Cartel and Zetas, nicknamed collectively as "The Company," are among the major drug cartels that are behind the drug-related violence that has swept Mexico in recent years, according to authorities. Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made fighting the cartels a major priority. The group also operates in cities across the United States, authorities said. The court documents detail telephone conversations between the four leaders and more than a dozen other cartel members allegedly discussing the transportation and smuggling of cocaine and marijuana into the United States. "These indictments allege a stunning and sophisticated operation by 'The Company' to move illegal drugs into our communities and cash back to Mexico," Breuer said. The State Department is offering a rewards totaling up to $50 million for information leading to the capture of four top leaders and six other cartel lieutenants. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Chen affair could overshadow U.S.-China economic talks
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 11:34 AM EDT, Tue May 1, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hillary Clinton is expected to arrive in Beijing on Wednesday
Obama: "Every time we meet with China, the issue of human rights comes up"
Chen Guangcheng escaped house arrest and fled to Beijing
"This is a pivotal moment for U.S. human rights diplomacy," ChinaAid's president says
Washington (CNN) -- As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton flew to China on Tuesday, President Barack Obama was tight-lipped about the whereabouts of escaped Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng and his potential impact on the discussions to be held this week in Beijing.
"Obviously, I'm aware of the press reports on the situation in China, but I'm not going to make a statement on the issue," Obama said in response to a question about whether Chen was under U.S. protection and whether the United States would grant him asylum if he were to ask for it.
"What I would like to emphasize is that every time we meet with China, the issue of human rights comes up," he said during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda at the White House.
"It is our belief that not only is that the right thing to do, because it comports with our principles and our belief in freedom and human rights, but also because we actually think China will be strong as it opens up and liberalizes its own system."
The importance of Chen Guangcheng
Where is blind Chinese activist Chen?
Fate of Chen Guangcheng
Diplomat: U.S. must protect dissident
"I have nothing for you on that subject," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in response to a question about whether Chen is in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, as reports have said.
Nuland confirmed that Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell was in Beijing, paving the way for Clinton's arrival, but would not elaborate. "I don't have anything further on that," Nuland said of whether Campbell's visit was related to Chen.
When pressed, she continued, "I have nothing for you on anything having to do with that matter."
Chen, a blind, self-taught lawyer, evaded guards who had kept him under house arrest for more than 18 months in a small eastern village and made his way to Beijing on April 22, friends and fellow activists said last week.
Once in the capital, Chen moved from safe house to safe house before finding refuge at the U.S. Embassy, according to Hu Jia, a fellow activist and one of the few people who have said he has seen Chen since he arrived in Beijing.
"This is a pivotal moment for U.S. human rights diplomacy," said Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, a Texas-based Christian human rights organization. He was quoted in a ChinaAid statement Sunday.
"Because of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the rule of law. If there is a reason why Chinese dissidents revere the U.S., it is for a moment like this."
Appearing on CNN's "John King, USA" on Monday, Fu said it was "a little disappointing" that Obama declined to make a statement about the situation.
"I understand President Obama has a delicate situation," Fu said. "But I always wish the U.S. politicians would support, I mean, unequivocally for all those who are persecuted instead of trying to spare the feeling of the persecutors."
ChinaAid, citing "a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation," said Sunday that Chen was under U.S. protection and that "high-level talks are currently under way between U.S. and Chinese officials" regarding his status.
The situation presents an extraordinary test for the Obama administration's approach to relations with China, creating a strain between upholding human rights and maintaining steady ties with Beijing.
Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner are scheduled to hold talks with Chinese officials in Beijing starting Thursday about strategic and economic issues. But the Chen affair could overshadow the economic talking points.
"If Chen is holed up in the U.S. Embassy, it is hard to fathom how the two sides will stay focused on the many pressing geostrategic and economic challenges in the relationship," Christopher Johnson, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in an opinion article for CNN.
The activist's flight from detention comes at a highly sensitive time for Chinese authorities. The ruling Communist Party has been rocked by a scandal involving former high-ranking leader Bo Xilai, whose wife is under investigation in relation to the mysterious death of a British businessman in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing.
The downfall of Bo, the former Chongqing party chief who is now being investigated in connection with serious disciplinary violations, has created shock waves ahead of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition in China that is due to unfold this year.
American and Chinese officials have declined to comment directly on the Chen case. But John Brennan, one of Obama's national security advisers, said Sunday that the U.S. government was "working very closely with the individuals involved."
The United States is aiming to strike the "appropriate balance" between its commitment to human rights and its diplomatic relationship with China, Brennan said on Fox News.
R. Nicholas Burns, who was an undersecretary of state for political affairs under George W. Bush, praised the Obama administration's low-key handling of the matter. "I just think that the administration is right to try to handle this privately right now, because that does not put the Chinese in an embarrassing situation publicly," he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
"In the end, this will be a humiliation for China -- that a human rights activist, a great man, someone whom we all admire, was able to escape house arrest, make his way to Beijing," he said. "That's going to put a big spotlight on the deficiencies of the Chinese system, on their outright violations of human rights and, I would think, in the end, this will be a defeat for China."
Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney said in a statement Sunday that he hopes the U.S. government will "take every measure to ensure that Chen and his family members are protected from further persecution."
Chen addressed Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in a video posted Friday on YouTube, detailing "cruel" abuses he said he and his family had suffered at the hands of authorities during months of heavily guarded detention in their home.
"They broke into my house, and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife," he said. "They pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter, beating and kicking her for hours. They also similarly violently assaulted me."
Journalists and supporters were prevented from visiting Chen during his house arrest. One of those supporters is Hollywood actor Christian Bale, who was roughed up by security guards while attempting a visit in December.
Chen, 40, rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices, such as alleged forced abortions, by China's family planning officials.
A local court sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison in 2006 on charges of damaging property and "organizing a mob to disturb traffic" in a protest, charges that his supporters called preposterous.
Since his September 2010 release from prison, he had been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter.
Chen's escape appears to have angered local officials holding him captive, with supporters saying that at least four members of his family have been detained.
In the YouTube video, the activist appealed to the Chinese premier to investigate his case and expressed concern about the welfare of his wife, mother and daughter.
"Although I'm free, my worries are only deepening," he said. "They have been persecuting my family for a long time, and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge."
The authorities' reaction also seems to have ensnared Chen's supporters, especially those suspected of aiding his escape.
After speaking to CNN, Hu, the fellow activist, was taken away by police for questioning, his wife posted on Twitter.
Chen's friend He Peirong disappeared Friday, shortly after speaking to CNN and other news organizations about the activist's escape.
The last message she sent out, according to ChinaAid's Fu, was that state security agents had arrived at her home in the eastern city of Nanjing.
"I'm not concerned about my own safety," she told CNN. "I hope they'll arrest me, not my friends."

Cyborg anthropologist: We can all be superhuman
By Amber Case, Special to CNN
updated 12:07 PM EST, Wed December 5, 2012 | STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Amber Case is the Director of the Esri R&D Center and a cyborg anthropologist
Cyborg anthropology is the study of the interaction between humans and technology
"A cyborg is simply someone who interacts with technology," says Case
Case: "Technology won't propagate until it fulfills a social need"
Editor's note: Amber Case is the Director of the Esri R&D Center, Portland, a company which aims to understand our world and "unleash the power of location." She was formerly the CEO of geolocation platform creator Geoloqi, Inc., acquired by Esri in Oct 2012.As a student of cyborg anthropology, Case studies the symbiotic interactions between humans and technology.
(CNN) -- What exactly is cyborg anthropology?
Cyborg anthropology is the study of the interaction between humans and technology, and how technology affects culture. Mobile technology allows one to stand almost anywhere in the world, whisper something, and be heard elsewhere. These devices that live in our pockets need to be fed every night require our frequent attention. In only a few years these devices have become stitched into the fabric of our everyday lives. Phones offer us respite from the boredom of waiting in lines, but they also inhibit us when they run out of batteries.
Everyone that uses technology is a superhuman.Amber Case
I'm fascinated with mobile devices for another reason -- they are a bundle of sensors that we walk around with every day. That sensor data can be used to do very interesting things, such as automatically turn on the lights in your house when you get home, or turn the lights off when you leave.
In traditional anthropology, somebody goes to another country, says: "How fascinating these people are! How interesting their tools and their culture are," and then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think these cultures are very exotic. cyborg anthropologists step back from the modern world and look at the everyday life and how the people around us are influenced by technology in everyday life.
Why did you decide to study cyborg anthropology?
When I was little, I was very interested in technology, science and mathematics. I grew up in the '80s, but read my dad's copy of 1960 World Book Encyclopedia. My favorite entry was on the modern computer. The machine filled an entire gymnasium and was used for military and business. As I grew up, I saw technology transition towards being used in everyday life. The only problem was that technology was still a pain in the neck to use. Most systems had too many menus and buttons.
A cyborg is not Terminator or Robocop, but the experience of everyday life that's been altered by technology.Amber Case
During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to the field of cyborg anthropology -- the study of humanity and technology. What I really liked about cyborg anthropology is that it crossed multiple fields of study. In academia, you can learn a lot about a certain field, but know nothing about another. Technology is so intertwined with humanity at this point that it takes multiple fields to understand both tools and people.
Explainer interactive: What is the 'Internet of Things'?
How would you define your cyborg self?
A cyborg is simply someone who interacts with technology. The technology can be a physical or a mental extension, and doesn't need to be implanted in the person. The origin of the word cyborg was from a 1960 paper on space travel, where it was used to describe the placement of external devices and clothing on a human to make them fit for space travel.
For thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self. And because of that, we're able to travel faster and communicate differently through the use of technology.
A cyborg is not Terminator or Robocop, but the experience of everyday life that's been altered by technology. Everyone that uses technology is a superhuman. It's not so strange anymore because it's the norm -- most everyone else around us is also a superhuman. The only time we notice it is when our devices run out of power. We're all super humans until our devices lose energy.
Read: China leads charge for Internet of things
You talk about a new form of "human connection," can you explain this to us?
60-second pitch: Whyd
Could robots take over Earth?
A vehicle is a physical transportation device, but there are limits to how small it can be made. A computer is a mental transportation device, but it need not be limited by its size and shape. We can put anything we want into computers and phones, and they don't get heavier because that information is invisible and weighs nothing, or is stored elsewhere, and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like? If you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time.
When you use a social network, your sense of self extends into that virtual space. Getting a "Like" on Facebook or a comment on a status is a dopamine hit the equivalent of getting a hug. This isn't really a new form of communication, but a new way of connecting.

Can you tell us about some projects you're working on?
I've always inspired by the technology built by Mark Weiser at Xerox Parc in the '70s, especially ubiquitous and calm computing. My projects have always been about using data in new ways, the future of the interface and the button, and the future of location.
What we need is a common language that allows all of these devices to communicate with one another.Amber Case
For instance, you should always be able to get information based on when you need it. Location plays a big role in that. Right now, data is stuck on the web, not where you are. When you land at the airport, you often have to look through your email to get to the information you need in order to get to your destination. It should already be there on your phone.
There is a lot of talk that we're finally entering into an era of the "Internet of Things." The exciting part is that we have all of these devices now that are sensors for reality -- sound, noise, temperature, images, location, air quality and so on. We can wear trackers to count our steps or measure our weight, and we can use tech to make a picture of where we've been. All of this data is interesting by itself, but all of the devices speak different languages. Devices made by different companies use different protocols. Some are open; others are closed. It's a modern day Tower of Babel.
Taking data from across many different silos is where the opportunity is. If I knew my mood, hunger level, and location at a given time of the day, I could figure out if my mood caused me to want to eat, or if I was unhappy at work and needed a different job. I could correlate amount of sleep with weight gain, and so on. What we need is a common language that allows all of these devices to communicate with one another. We saw this with SMS (allowing different phones to talk to each other across networks), SMTP/POP that allowed for modern email to exist (because it allowed modern email accounts to talk to each other across networks), and Interpress (allowing the modern printer industry to form.) That hasn't been solved for devices.
Once we get a lot of data onto maps, we can really begin to understand reality in much different ways, like where to build a house to increase the happiness of the people inside it, how to make routes that avoid accidents, and how to design better urban systems. I'm really excited about platform that Esri provides. We'll be integrating the Geoloqi location technology into the Esri platform in July 2013 and will be able to open up an entire world of datasets and solutions accessible before only by geographers, scientists and researchers.

Black artists, musicians and writers flocked to Paris to find greater freedom of expression
Tours go to many vibrant Paris neighborhoods to retrace the steps of notable residents
(CNN) -- Think Paris, and the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Élysées and haute couture come to mind. But the City of Light also is rich in African-American history. Keeping this history alive are tour companies that share it, up close and personal, with visitors to France.
From legendary entertainer Josephine Baker to internationally acclaimed artist Henry Ossawa Tanner to World War I's ragtime-and-jazz-playing "Harlem Hellfighters," Paris has embraced African-American culture like few other places. Because of that legendary embrace -- one that black folks in the States had heard about since the 1800s -- Paris loomed large in their imaginations. To many who didn't always feel welcome in their native country, the city sounded like a place where they could emotionally exhale.
"It's always been about freedom for us," says Marcus Bruce, the Benjamin E. Mays Professor of Religious Studies at Bates College and author of "Henry Ossawa Tanner: A Spiritual Biography." He's now researching a book on African-Americans at the worldwide Paris Exposition of 1900 and exploring their Parisian lives in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Legendary Harlem-born author James Baldwin, who left for Paris in 1948, said "African-Americans discover in Paris the terms by which they can define themselves. It's the freedom to work beyond the assumptions of what we can and can't do as African-Americans. It's a different rhythm and pace. We can imagine ourselves in new ways in that space."
10 fabulous free finds in Paris
That's where these treks through African-American history come in.
Walking the Spirit Tours Julia Browne launched Walking the Spirit Tours in 1994, and it became the first company to focus specifically on black American history in Paris.
Back then, she says, "I'd contact travel agents in the States and they would say, 'Why would people want to do that?'" Times have changed for Browne, who is based near Toronto and frequently travels to France to lead tours.
For example, Browne's "Writers, Artists & Intellectuals" tour traipses through the lively Latin Quarter and chic Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Her guests get to peek inside the Parisian café where Richard Wright wrote and see the urban landscapes that inspired Boston-born painter Lois Mailou Jones. "The Entertainers" tour strolls still-vibrant Montmartre, the quartier where both Josephine Baker and Ada "Bricktop" Smith once owned clubs.
Snapshots: City of Light -- and love
While 85% of Walking the Spirit tour-goers are African-American, "We do a lot of school groups from Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey and more and more French schools and organizations. It's professors in European universities who are teaching black studies," says Browne.
"For African-Americans or black Europeans, it creates a tremendous sense of pride and belonging. "Paris is not just a foreign city," says Browne, a certified France specialist who also offers black history tours elsewhere in France.
Browne has hired a 20-something Walking the Spirit tour guide who moved to Paris from the States to pursue a singing career, and her experience in the city "brings it up to date. People enjoy hearing the real, on-the-ground stories from her."
A new DVD vividly captures much of what Browne's tours bring to life. In "When African Americans Came to Paris," Browne, award-winning documentarian Joanne Burke, and writer/cameraman David Burke feature six short videos that offer a fascinating, early 20th century look at black Americans in Paris.
Walking the Spirit Tours operate year-round, with prices ranging from $60 to $70 per adult, with children up to age 15 half-price.
Black Paris Tours
Oakland, California, native and former broadcast journalist Ricki Stevenson fulfilled a lifelong dream of moving to the City of Light, and in 1997 launched Black Paris Tours. Her talk show host roots are obvious as she recounts the experiences of now legendary black American expatriates for guests. With the historic Arc de Triomphe on the famed boulevard Champs-Élysées as the backdrop for her tour's start, Stevenson uses laminated photos and sketches as props that help bring this brand of American history to light.
"I can do five tours in one week and they won't be the same. It really depends on the people," says Stevenson, who like Browne frequently gets university groups from around the world. Her tours also have attracted American celebrities and politicians, including R&B star Brian McKnight and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. "It really depends on the level of interest, the level of understanding. I've had professors of African-American history on the same day, and it was just magic."
As she's done for years, Stevenson punctuates her historical soundtrack with a primer on Parisian protocol: "How to be polite, what to expect, so that they get into being French for a minute." She advises her guests to always greet store owners and clerks with a friendly bonjour or bonsoir when entering and au revoir when leaving; to keep their voices low when on trains and buses and in restaurants.
"They may come as tourists, but I want them to leave as travelers who don't just pick up souvenirs. I try to make that correlation so they understand where they are, what the culture is.
"Having been a travel reporter for six years and traveling all over the world, I want to see where people go to shop. Take me to the 'hood. I want to see us (black Parisians) as much as possible."
Since spring 2012, one of Black Paris Tours' four guides functions as a "nightlife coordinator" for guests who want to experience Paris after dark. This French-speaking guide arranges evenings on the town for guests, handles plans for dining, entertainment and transportation -- and will accompany them on these adventures.
Black Paris Tours operate Monday-Friday except during late December and January. Adult tour prices range from €70 (about $94) for a two-thirds day tour to €100 (about $134) for a full-day walking-bus tour (doesn't include €10 lunch). Children from age 5 to 15 are €30 each. Discounts are available for groups of eight or more.
Entrée to Black Paris When Houston native Dr. Monique Y. Wells began leading tours in Paris more than 10 years ago, most of her guests were university study-abroad groups. She still gets them, but Entrée to Black Paris now has expanded to offer 12 different African-American history walks, including "Black History in and Around the Luxembourg Garden" and "Montparnasse -- The Artists' World."
Wells' company specializes in private, guided tours, and her most popular is "Black Paris After World War II," which Wells says offers "a lot of talk about the entire African-American diaspora experience."
"It's important for African-Americans to see there are other race struggles going on in the world," says Wells, whose e-book "Black Paris Profiles," shares the stories of 24 black American and Afro-Caribbean folks who reinvented their lives here.
"And for people who are not black and taking the tours -- if they are Americans -- to see just how much the African-American presence has brought to Paris. The Paris they know would not be the same, and it's important for them to understand that."
Wells mentions jazz, first introduced to France by black Americans. Not only has this music led to a French-grown jazz culture, but "so much art from the 20th century has been influenced by jazz."
Culinary contributions also figure into Entrée's year-round tours. "When I moved here, you could not find sweet potatoes on mainstream menus," says Wells, a co-author of "Food for the Soul: A Texas Expatriate Nurtures Her Culinary Roots in Paris."
Now, she says, this African-American Southern food staple is everywhere -- and served thinly sliced and fried as a bite-sized hors d'oeuvre or soup garnish.
Passionate about helping tourists explore French culture through food, Wells this month will start joining Jacksonville, Florida-based Chef Amadeus for "The Southern Passion Lounge in Paris," an Internet radio show. Broadcast the third Thursday of each month at 1 p.m. ET, they'll transport listeners to Parisian eateries through food, wine and music -- and also will spotlight French restaurants and chefs in the States.
The newest Entrée to Black Paris offering takes guests to the western Parisian suburbs for the "Josephine Baker Tour in Le Vésinet." They'll see Le Beau Chêne, the mansion Baker owned and called home for 18 years, have lunch at a nearby American-owned bed and breakfast and learn about Baker's life over dessert.
Wells and husband Tom Reeves also operate Discover Paris!, a service offering everything from gourmet food tours to self-guided downloadable walks to presentations on "Black Paris and the Myth of a Colorblind France."
Entrée to Black Paris' prices range from $25-$30 for self-guided walking tours to $325 for private, guided walking tours for between one and 15 people (no per-person charge). Activities such as museum art walks and the "Josephine Baker Tour in Le Vésinet" are group-only; contact info@parisinsights.com for prices.

Claudette Robinson, another member of the Miracles, said that while Rogers was her cousin, he was more "like a brother to me." On her website, she said he died about 6:30 a.m. Sunday.
"Bobby will be missed and mourned by many," said Robinson, who was once married to Smokey Robinson and serves as the Miracles spokeswoman. "Rest in peace, my brother of 'song.' "
Robinson, Rogers and the rest of the Miracles were a cornerstone act for writer-producer Berry Gordy's infant Motown Records, putting songs such as "Shop Around," "Tracks of My Tears" and "The Tears of a Clown" on the R&B and pop charts throughout the 1960s. After Robinson left the group, the Miracles had a No. 1 hit with "Love Machine" in 1976.
When the group disbanded in the late 1970s, Rogers started an interior design business. The Miracles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

Australian election: Has 'sexist' Tony Abbott sunk 'gender war'?
By Amanda Wilson, Special to CNN
updated 4:06 AM EDT, Fri August 23, 2013
There was no love lost between Tony Abbott and former prime minister Julia Gillard seen here in parliament in 2010.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Australian leadership candidate has been accused of sexism, misogyny
Polls show Tony Abbott is on track for an election victory on September 7
In 2012, former PM Julia Gillard's attack on him in parliament went viral
Australian voters don't seem disturbed by recent sexist gaffes
Editor's note: Amanda Wilson is the former editor of Australian newspaper "The Sydney Morning Herald."
Sydney (CNN) -- Tony Abbott is a throwback to older, safer times when a knockabout Aussie bloke could call a sheila "a good sort" and no one among those who understood the slang for a good-looking woman would blink.
And it seems that much of Australia likes him that way -- the latest opinion polls have the 55-year-old Australian conservative opposition leader set to be the country's next prime minister after the federal election on September 7.
Never mind the fact Australia's first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, went viral with her damning misogyny speech about Abbott in the Australian Parliament -- "I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will not."

The rise and fall of Julia Gillard
Australia's first female PM ousted
Little boy photobombs politician Never mind that a suitably solemn Abbott sat across from the Labor PM as she listed statement after statement of his that cemented his sexist credentials. Never mind that women around the world cheered to hear a female leader name it and shame it.

At home, Gillard's angry performance earlier this year proved to be nothing but a glancing blow. Those women who had long loathed him as a sexist felt vindicated. Some commentators tried to de-fang the attack by going to town on the fact Gillard had conflated sexism and misogyny. But it was all water off the backs of those Australians who thought then, and now, it's time for a change of government and Abbott's attitude to women is not a significant issue.
As veteran feminist Eva Cox says: "He's an 'old-fashioned' sexist, not a woman hater. It's just that he doesn't get that equality means treating women as normal human beings. He can't resist making the odd sexist ha-ha comment."
His deputy Julie Bishop disagrees Abbott is sexist. She told Channel 9's Today program: "He's always been very respectful and supportive of me and my other female colleagues."
A few months after her famous speech, Gillard was ousted at the hands of her real rival, the former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, whom she had helped to remove from office. As Gillard now sits on the sidelines, possibly enjoying a small twinge of relief that she is no longer subjected to almost daily attacks on her appearance, her body shape and voice, Australians find themselves in the middle of a testosterone-fueled election campaign. Yet strangely, as Rudd exhorts Abbott to "man up" and Abbott demands his opponent "be man enough," the campaign has placed sexism front and center once again.
This week Abbott was forced to dump a male candidate over a web forum which, according to media reports, included jokes about women making love on pool tables and "tit banter."
Abbott, meanwhile, has suffered no harm electorally. He is an unreconstructed male who loves his sport, likes a beer and bravely tries to don the garb of man who cares about women -- in the right way. He now trots out one or several of his female family members, including his gay sister, to prove his credentials as a female-friendly politician. Trouble is, he just keeps having "Dad moments."
On the campaign trail outside Sydney last week he listed "sex appeal" as one of the key attributes of his party's local candidate, Fiona Scott. There was no mention of her MBA or successful business career.
He later described it as "exuberance" and a "dad moment" after his 20-year-old daughter Bridget told reporters: "Dad is running for prime minister so he can't have any sort of daggy [uncool] moments. Everyone's Dad is daggy in their own sort of way at times."
His daughter's comments took the sting out of Abbott's gaffe and may have convinced a few female voters that he is trying hard to curb outbreaks of his old-school attitudes.

Abbott and his team appear to have decided that his sexist gaffes add to his knockabout "larrikin" charm -- always an asset for a successful male Australian politician -- and that a few lame "dad" comments will appeal to voters who also pull their rough-hewn males up in this way.
There's a lot feminist groups that are so anti-Abbott that they are objecting to this because it's come from him.Eva Cox, feminist
It would explain why, a few days after his "sex appeal" moment, Abbott was back in front of the cameras with Scott and, far from apologizing, he was on about her looks again. Commenting on her answer to a question about his economic plan, he quipped: "Obviously from that answer she ain't just a pretty face."
Scott's response was on message. There was no need to apologize for an "absolutely charming compliment between friends."
Now Abbott has upped the ante for female voters, throwing on the table what is the most expensive siren call to them Australia has ever seen. It's a policy which his minders no doubt hope will erase forever the lingering smear of sexism and misogyny. He is offering a generous -- extravagant even, according to economic commentators -- paid parental leave scheme that signals his deeply-held social policy ambitions and old-fashioned family values.
The scheme has put him at odds with business groups and many in his own party who have failed to dissuade him from it. It has also led to claims from unions that the scheme is unfair to low-paid women. The A$5.5 billion (US$5 billion) scheme gives working mothers six months' leave on full pay, capped at a salary of A$150,000 (US$135,000). About half of the cost will be covered by a 1.5% levy on taxable incomes over A$5 million (US$4.5 million) of the 3,000 largest Australian companies. This will be offset by a cut in company tax, but what has not been detailed is where the rest will come from, apart from ''associated reductions in other outlays.''

The announcement has had a mixed response from female commentators, with Cox declaring that the "shrill" criticism of the scheme by some feminists was personal, not political. "There are a lot feminist groups that are so anti-Abbott that they are objecting to this because it's come from him."
Melbourne University Press publisher Louise Adler, who published his book "Battlelines," agrees that Abbott has been unpopular with women, but of his paid parental leave scheme she stated she was "in favor of anything that assists families to be with their children."
He's always been very respectful and supportive of me and my other female colleagues.Julie Bishop, deputy opposition leader
It is another nail in the coffin of the national conversation about women and leadership and sexism that Gillard's show-stopping speech ignited but which died away with her departure from the political stage. A News poll this week confirmed that female Labor voters deserted Gillard and have returned to the fold since Rudd took over.
Yallana Burgess, 29, told The Australian she had not backed Gillard, but would be supporting Rudd. Gillard, she said, had not been a role model for women "and she wasn't charismatic... she could have used her position as a woman more effectively and I never got the sense that she was herself."
Cox believes Gillard's speech failed to ignite a national war on sexism because the former prime minister was not much of a feminist. "She was not a feminist leader. She didn't play the gender card -- although that was a plus. She was also not a promoter of the anti-sexist thing. She didn't make a big appeal to the women of Australia -- she didn't pitch for it.
"A lot of women were passionate about supporting her, but they were in a minority," says Cox.
It remains to be seen at the ballot box if Abbott's multi-billion dollar policy pitch to women trumps any "embarrassing dad" sexist tendencies or female Labor voters' preference for Rudd over Gillard.
But surely it says something about the level of "old fashioned" political debate in Australia when one of the country's more colorful mining magnates, Clive Palmer, feels the need to stress his own candidacy with this tweet: "My hair is not as silky as Rudd's and my body not as toned as Abbott's but I offer common sense and real business experience #ausvotes."

Vitamin B? Why beer is good for your health
By Keri Glassman, upwave.com
updated 4:31 PM EDT, Mon September 30, 2013
When it comes to beer, "light" refers to both the percent of alcohol and calories.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Beer offers anywhere from 95 to 360 calories in a 12-ounce serving
One to two beers a day is good for your bones
Don't overdo it, though
Editor's note: upwave is Turner Broadcasting's new lifestyle brand designed to entertain the health into you! Visit upwave.com for more information and follow upwave on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram @upwaveofficial.
(upwave.com) -- What it is
I do likes me a cold one on a hot summer day, and a fall ball game just isn't the same without an ale in my hand. Fear of the great beer belly has kept suds out of the refrigerators and hands of beer enthusiasts all over the land, but is it possible that one of America's favorite beverages has gotten an undeserved bad rap?
After all, beer is created from just four basic ingredients: water, barley, hops and yeast. The result of these ingredients dancing together is alcohol and CO2. That's a combo that goes down easy, and there are so many ways to blend the brew that you're sure to find an ale, stout, lager or amber that is just right for you.
The dirty deets
Your doc may have told you that drinking alcohol in moderation is good for your health, but usually wine gets all the cred for the antioxidant benefits. Truth be told, beer and wine contain the same amount of antioxidants. There are some other things you should know:
• The protein and B-vitamin content of beer is higher than wine. Yeah, going for a brewski after a rousing game of touch football with your work team will help you replenish your protein better than a glass of chardonnay. But here's a buzzkill: Even though beer is a good source of B vitamins, the alcohol in it mostly cancels out those benefits.
upwave: The link between protein and weight loss
• Beer offers anywhere from 95 to 360 calories in a 12-ounce serving, with the average bottle of beer in the 150-calorie range. A five-ounce glass of wine will run you about 120 calories. Sometimes the light beer is a better calorie choice than the wine. Since the FDA doesn't require calories to be on the label, do the homework and math on your favorite beer to know where it should be in your beverage lineup, because those calories do find a way to linger. (Call it a beer belly, call it a muffin top; you just don't want to find one circlin' your middle.)
• One to two beers a day is good for your bones. Brew contains silicon, which is in very few foods and is linked to bone strength and health. Now that's something to consider before going for your next bone-density scan.
• Think light in color equals light in calories? Not always the case. "Light" actually refers to the percent of alcohol and calories. Higher-alcohol beers have more calories, so if you're watching your weight, a Guinness is actually about the same as a Bud.
upwave: Partying on a diet? How to eat (and drink) smart
How to chow down
You get up to one (femmes) or two (dudes) alcoholic beverages a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control. When it comes to suds, that means a 12-ounce bottle or a draught with an inch of head. More than that can tip the health benefits into the health damaging category.
• You want a well-chilled pint glass. Keep it in the freezer for at least a couple of hours so it's all white and frosty and smoky when you pull it out. Tilt the glass and pour a stream of refreshment down the side, standing the glass upright as you get to the end of the pour. This allows for the perfect amount of fluffy bubbles at the top.
• Beer is a great liquid ingredient to add to your soups, marinades and culinary whole-grain masterpieces and can replace broth, stock or plain water. It adds delicate flavor and aroma. The alcohol will cook off, so no need to worry about getting your buddies drunk off your eats.
• If there is leftover beer from your beer-can chicken, beer bread or beer-battered jalapenos, dump it over your head. Seriously, beer is great for restoring life and shine to your hair by nourishing and smoothing strands.

In the know
If you had begrudgingly written off beer, put it back on your roster. Strategically place it into your beverage batting order when you're at a game or looking for refreshment that pairs well with friends and fun. Don't overdo it, though. Too much of this good thing will take you out of your own starting lineup.

Reaction pours in to Gingrich's decision WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, November 6) -- In deciding not to run again for House speaker and in fact leave Congress, Newt Gingrich shocked official Washington and altered the political landscape.
Here's the text of Gingrich's statement, and reaction from lawmakers:
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's announcement
"Today I have reached a difficult personal decision. I will not be a candidate for Speaker of the 106th congress. The Republican conference needs to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward where I believe I still have a significant role to play for our country and our party. My party will have my full support, and I will do all I can to help us win in 2000.
"I urge my colleagues to pick leaders who can both reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. They have my prayers and my thoughts as they undertake this task.
"I want to thank everyone who friendship and support has made these years enjoyable. Marianne and I are grateful to the citizens of Georgia who gave us the wonderful opportunity to represent them and to my Republican colleagues who became our extended family. Thank you and God bless you."
President Bill Clinton
"Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary, leading the Republican party to a majority in the House, and joining me in a great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st Century.
"Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we were able to work together in the national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the world."
House GOP Conference Chairman John Boehner
"As he has done so many times in the last 20 years, Newt Gingrich has shown incredible courage. He has always put his party's interest and his nation's interest ahead of his own. I know he will continue to serve his friends and his colleagues as an elder statesmen in our party."
Rep. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
"I'm saddened that my longtime close friend and colleague, Speaker Newt Gingrich, has decided to resign from Congress. Newt Gingrich is a visionary who was responsible for ending 40 years of high taxes, high spending, and a welfare state that had grown out of control. His leadership brought us welfare reform, the first budget surplus in 25 years, and a return to the opportunity society that America values. All Americans owe Newt Gingrich a debt of gratitude for his service to our country.
"I am actively considering running for Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. It's vital to our nation that we put principles before politics and ideas before ambition.
"I will spend this weekend with my family considering how I can best serve our nation and the low-tax, less-government cause in which I believe."
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
"Newt Gingrich resignation as Speaker was the aftershock from last Tuesday's political earthquake. The American people sent a strong message that the Republican Congress was a failure -- that its leadership didn't address the issues they cared about. The Speaker's resignation is the reaction to that message.
"This is a real opportunity for a new start for the House. It's time to put aside the intense partisanship of the past in favor of a coalition for change which encompasses both parties.
"I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as Speaker will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was wrought on this institution over the last four years.
"It is critically important that the Speaker has a strong sense of respect for the institution of the House and for members on the other side of the aisle. The Speaker is not only the leader of a party, he is the representative of the People's House, and has a responsibility to all members, not just to fellow Republicans."
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
"Newt Gingrich has been a visionary figure in our party, one who has transformed American politics and reshaped the political debate in a remarkably short time. His announcement today was a magnanimous gesture, typical of the man whose selflessness and singular commitment to our party's agenda has led us to three historic consecutive majorities in the House of Representatives. It is now time for the party he has served so well to refocus on the issues that matter so much to him, and to all Americans: lower taxes, leaner government, greater individual freedoms, and enhanced opportunities for all Americans -- with no one left behind."
Rep. Bob Barr (R-Georgia)
"I am deeply saddened as a friend and Member of Congress to learn of Newt Gingrich's decision to resign from Congress. The fact that Republicans hold a majority in Congress in the first place is directly attributable to Newt Gingrich's incredible vision and perseverence over the past decade.
"Newt Gingrich will leave Congress as a great American hero, with a list of accomplishments rivaled by few in our nation's history. He will be sorely missed and deserves the thanks of a grateful nation."
Sen. Don Nickles (R-Oklahoma)
"Newt Gingrich's ideas contributed significantly to the Republican Party's greatest victories of the post-war period, and his commonsense conservative agenda has helped change the nation's political dialogue. He will be missed, but the traditional Republican policies that he pushed will continue in Congress and across the nation."
Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Maryland)
"Newt will go down in history for his phenomenal achievement in winning the Republican majority in the House for the first time in 40 years. His action today was bold and gracious."
Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-North Carolina)
"I was very saddened by the news that Congressman Gingrich stepped down. I was a strong supporter of Gingrich since I came to office 12 years ago. I am very sad."
