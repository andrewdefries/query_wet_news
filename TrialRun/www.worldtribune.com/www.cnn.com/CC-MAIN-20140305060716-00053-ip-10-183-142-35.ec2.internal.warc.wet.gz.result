Federer, Nadal and Djokovic cruise throughStory Highlights Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic all reach singles third round Nadal particularly impressing in defeating Australian Lleyton Hewitt 6-1 6-2 Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, and Jelena Jankovic through in women'sNext Article in World Sport » (CNN) -- The top three seeds in the Olympics men's singles, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, all moved easily into the third round with convincing wins in Beijing on Tuesday. Nadal was in blistering form as he reached the Beijing third round with the loss of just three games. The women's draw also saw dominant performances from the Williams sisters and Serbian world number one Jelena Jankovic. Swiss top seed Federer breezed to a 6-2, 6-4 win over Rafael Arevalo of El Salvador, ranked 447th in the world and only playing because of his country's small number of competitors. "To be playing a player with a very low ranking in a very big pressure situation for me, I have nothing to win, only (everything) to lose," said Federer. "It was all a matter of getting through: hopefully not getting a fright or anything, which I didn't." Second seed Nadal crushed Lleyton Hewitt 6-1 6-2, while Serbian third seed Djokovic beat German veteran Rainer Schuettler 6-4 6-2. Nadal, who will take over from Federer as world number one next week, was always in full control against the Australian former number one, now ranked 38th in the world. Hewitt had played a gruelling doubles match that stretched into the early hours of Tuesday after going to 18-16 in the third set and his tiredness was noticeable as he crumbled under Nadal's relentless attack. "I played very well. It was one of the best matches I have played," said Nadal. The Spaniard will play Russian Igor Andreev in the third round, with Federer meeting Czech Tomas Berdych, the 17th seed, who knocked him out in Athens four years ago. Djokovic faces a tricky tie against Russian 13th seed Mikhail Youzhny. Don't Miss Special report: Beijing 08
Defending Olympic champion Nicolas Massu of Chile was dumped out by number seven seed David Nalbandian, while Russian fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko went down 7-5 6-3 to Paul-Henri Mathieu. Mathieu is joined in the next round by French compatriots Gilles Simon, the 10th seed, and Gael Monfils after their respective wins over Guillermo Canas of Argentina and Romanian Victor Hanescu. In the women's draw, the Williams sisters and Jankovic were in blistering form. World number one Jankovic, the top player in the absence through injury of compatriot Ana Ivanovic, brushed aside Ukraine's Alona Bondarenko 7-5 6-1. The 23-year-old from Belgrade was wearing a strapping on her troublesome right calf and did not look completely at ease but said she hoped it would continue to get better. "I took some painkillers to be able to play, otherwise it's quite sore," Jankovic said. The Williams sisters both confirmed their status as among the hot favorites for gold in the singles, which has been hit by a raft of withdrawals. Fourth seed Serena took just 44 minutes to dispatch Australia's Samantha Stosur, reeling off the last 10 games to love. "It was clean," said Williams, who missed the 2004 Games in Athens through injury. "My way of improving on it is to keep it up." The 2000 doubles winner's third round opponent is French 15th seed Alize Cornet, who subdued a vociferous home crowd in outclassing China's Peng Shuai 6-2 6-2. Serena's sister Venus, the seventh seed, demolished Czech Iveta Benesova 6-1 6-4, however, three other women's seeds were knocked out. Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova, the 10th seed, was thrashed by Danish teen Caroline Wozniacki, Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska went down to Italian Francesca Schiavone, and Swiss number 13 seed Patty Schnyder was beaten by Austrian Sybille Bammer. Home hopes will be carried into the next round by Zheng Jie and Li Na, who play Dinara Safina and Kaia Kanepi of Estonia respectively.

Washington (CNN) -- Folklore says that George Washington was known for never telling a lie. But as the United States marks its first president's birthday, a new poll indicates that 74 percent of the public thinks the father of our country did lie to the public while he served as president. It's an indication that Americans think the government has been broken for a very, very long time. The CNN/Opinion Corporation survey was released Monday on the 278th anniversary of Washington's birth. Three quarters of people questioned in the survey think that modern-day federal officials are not honest, a figure that is essentially unchanged since 1994. But the poll suggests that Americans think the problem of dishonesty is not a new one. And it's not just George Washington; 71 percent think that Abraham Lincoln, known as "Honest Abe," also lied to the public while serving in the White House. Full results (pdf) "It's all part of a rich tradition in American history -- the belief that politicians are not always telling the truth," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. What should we make of the figures for Washington and Lincoln? "Part of it may be the recognition that, however much we revere them today, both men were politicians, and Americans are always a little cynical about people seeking office. Part of it may also be a realistic assessment that the president sometimes has to keep things from the public," adds Holland. "But whether it's based on cynicism or realism, or a little of both, it's an indication that Americans think that our government has been broken for many, many years." According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

Beck: Norway camp smacks of 'Hitler Youth' By the CNN Wire Staff "Who does a camp for kids that's all about politics?" Glenn Beck asked Monday on his radio show. STORY HIGHLIGHTS"Who does a camp for kids that's all about politics? Disturbing," Beck saysThere was no comment from Beck's representatives Monday nightAn organization that Beck founded held political camps for youth this summer
RELATED TOPICS

Youth Organizations
(CNN) -- In the wake of last week's massacre in Norway, U.S. conservative commentator Glenn Beck on Monday compared the summer camp where most of the 76 victims died to the Hitler Youth organization of Nazi Germany. Beck, on his radio show, declared the killings "the work of a madman" and called the suspect "as bad as Osama bin Laden." But before launching into that condemnation, he questioned what the victims were doing at a summer camp run by Norway's ruling Labour Party. Beck said the camp "sounds a little like, you know, the Hitler Youth or whatever. Who does a camp for kids that's all about politics? Disturbing." However, politically-oriented camps are being organized in several U.S. states by chapters of the "9/12 Project" -- an organization founded by Beck himself in 2009. The Colorado 9/12 Project hosted a "Patriot Camp" for kids in grades 1-5 earlier this month, featuring programs on "our Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and the values and principles that are the cornerstones of our nation." And in August, the Danville, Kentucky, chapter is holding a "Vacation Liberty School" that organizers pledge "will help your children understand where we came from. Understand where we went wrong. Understand where the fork in the road was, and which path we should have taken." The suspect in Friday's Norwegian massacre is a right-wing Norwegian who police say wanted to halt what he believed as the Islamic "colonization" of the country. But while condemning the attacks, Beck said he predicted last fall that Europe "is going to go into problems with radical Islam" and cited Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders as saying "Political correctness and multiculturalism is killing Europe, and he's right." Attempts to contact Beck's representatives were unsuccessful Monday night. Beck recently left his hour-long show on Fox News Channel, but his radio program is still heard on 400-plus stations and he recently launched a web television venture, GBTV. Before joining Fox, Beck hosted a show on CNN's sister network HLN.

War crimes suspect to make 2nd appearance in court By the CNN Wire Staff Goran Hadzic (center) is taken to see his ailing mother on July 22. He is now in the Netherlands. STORY HIGHLIGHTSHe is the last of 161 suspects indicted by the courtHadzic is the former president of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic in CroatiaHe will be asked to enter a plea at his appearance

War Crimes
Serbia
(CNN) -- Goran Hadzic -- the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large until his arrest last month -- will make a second appearance at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on Wednesday. An ex-Croatian Serb rebel leader who had been a fugitive for seven years, Hadzic was captured in Serbia on July 20. He was wanted for crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the wars that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The former president of a self-proclaimed Serbian republic in Croatia, Hadzic is accused of trying to remove Croats and other non-Serbs from the territory and the "extermination or murder of hundreds of Croat or other non-Serb civilians," among many other crimes, according to the tribunal. On Wednesday, Hadzic will be asked to enter a plea. He had declined to do so at this first appearance on July 25. He was the last fugitive of the 161 people indicted by the tribunal, which is based in The Hague. He is charged with a number of offenses committed in eastern Slavonia and Croatia, including persecution, murder, imprisonment, torture, cruel treatment and deportation, the tribunal said. Prosecutors say he and others sought to permanently remove a majority of the Croat and non-Serb population from about a third of Croatia to make way for a Serb-dominated state. Hadzic is charged in one incident in which 264 people were taken from a hospital in November 1991, detained and "beaten and tortured before being transported to a remote execution site ... where they were killed and buried in a mass grave," the tribunal said. Other Croats and non-Serbs were held in "brutal" conditions" characterized by inhumane treatment, overcrowding, starvation, forced labor, inadequate medical care and constant physical and psychological assault, including mock executions, torture, beatings and sexual assault," the tribunal said.

Don't demonize our troops
By Rodney Smith, Special to CNN
updated 7:57 PM EDT, Sat May 5, 2012
Rod Smith says only those who have been to war can understand what troops are going through.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Those who have not been to war cannot judge the actions of those who have, Smith says
Soldiers who posed with bodies should be reproached but not demonized, he says
Troops are not different from your sons and daughters, Smith says
Editor's note: Rod Smith is a combat veteran of the Marine Corps and the father of a Marine veteran of the Afghanistan War. He is a government contractor in the Washington area. (CNN) -- In recent days, we have again found our national attention turned to a handful of images someone has brought back from Afghanistan, this time showing American soldiers "posing with insurgents' body parts," in the words of a typical commentary.
The report is tinged, as always, with tones of shame and reproach. Reflexively, our gaze turns inward and the chapel bells of moral outrage are once again rung. A vague shroud of nobility is draped on the term "insurgents," as if they were daring mountain climbers or intrepid explorers. The 99% of American households with no attachment to our military shake their collective heads and wonder at such repugnant developments, How could our boys?
Well, I'll tell you.
They're in a war, as cruel and nasty as any war is. They are suffering and bleeding in ways that those of you who have never been there will ever understand. They deal every day with an adversary who is not noble by any stretch. He is a skulking murderer who does nothing braver than wait, watch and press a command detonator that destroys in one violent instant young American lives and limbs. Here is what that slinking, crouching, hiding enemy brings them, in the words of a young Navy surgeon writing anonymously on deadspin.com last month:
Opinion: Why are we still in 'Vietghanistan?'
"One Marine from my unit lost both legs high on the femur in an instant, and the blast opened his pelvis. Marines and a corpsman were at his side in seconds, and knew where to find his arteries to stop the bleeding from his gaping groin. His circulatory system no longer circulated — his arteries and veins were a nest of open-ended tubes draining away from his heart. The team at Camp Bastion stabilized his injuries, and in the process gave him more than 100 units of blood. Twenty citizens' worth of blood went into him and flowed out his wounds again before he was stable."
That is what your soldiers and Marines, the ones you sent to that backward, violent place, live and die with. And consequently, on those rare occasions when they can corner the craven shadow dwellers who have been inflicting such dreadful, random, merciless death and dismemberment, they kill them. Gratefully. Enthusiastically. Passionately. In repayment for what has been suffered on your behalf. In expiation of the terrible burden of having watched helplessly as comrades are killed and maimed in the most awful ways that you in your living rooms can't even begin to imagine.
So if they are caught in some primitive dance of celebration over the dead bodies of their tormenters, catch them up short. Tell them it is undignified, undisciplined and bad counterinsurgency. But don't demonize them or lionize their enemy.
Before you condemn their character, step back and reflect on the fact that you sent them there. They went instead of your own son or daughter, from whom they are no different. Ask yourself whatever could make our young men act that way. And finally, accept that you don't know the answer, because you have never been there.
To know that, and still claim the right to sit in judgment, is a betrayal as profound as anything that happens in war.

Owner of plane carrying Jenni Rivera linked to troubled businessman
By Mariano Castillo and Rafael Romo, CNN
updated 10:35 AM EST, Wed December 12, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two lawsuits link owner of plane carrying Jenni Rivera to man in trouble with the law
The lawsuits allege that Christian Eduardo Esquino Nunez is linked to aviation company
Esquino has been convicted of falsifying plane maintenance records
The aviation company denies in court documents that the man works for them
(CNN) -- Two civil lawsuits against the company that owns the private jet that crashed Sunday in northern Mexico -- presumably killing music star Jenni Rivera -- accuse the firm of lying about its links to a businessman convicted of falsifying maintenance records.
Insurance firms QBE and Commerce & Industry Insurance Company filed suits this year seeking to rescind its contracts with aviation company Starwood Management because of alleged falsehoods.
In short, the insurance companies claim that Starwood lied in its application for coverage about the history of the planes being insured and about the true owner of the company.
Starwood is the owner of the Learjet that crashed Sunday in Mexico, most likely killing Rivera, who has not been found. DNA tests are currently being conducted to confirm the identities of the remains found at the crash site.

Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera died December 9, 2012, when the small plane she was traveling in crashed in the mountains of northern Mexico, her brother told CNN. Rivera, 43, was known to fans as "La Diva de la Banda," or the Diva of Banda Music, establishing herself as a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. Recently, she had been working to crack the English-language U.S. market.
Rivera fans gather at her memorial ceremony, held December 19, 2012, at Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California.
Federal police work near the site of the plane crash in Iturbide, Mexico. "The aircraft was destroyed, totally fragmented," an aviation official told CNN affiliate Televisa. Six others were killed, including the singer's publicist, attorney and makeup artists, her brother Gustavo Rivera told CNN en Espanol.
A helicopter flies over the crash site as investigators search the area. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
Soldiers and civil protection personnel inspect the perimeter of the crash site. The plane took off from Monterrey, Mexico, and lost contact with air traffic controllers. Workers search around the accident scene in Mexico's Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range.
Security members work at the site of the plane wreckage.
Forensic technicians arrive at a base set up by federal police near the plane crash site.

Latin superstar killed in plane crash
Remembering singer Jenni Rivera
Jenni Rivera's family and fans mourn
Rivera's plane had crashed before
Rivera was a Mexican-American star with a rising cross-border appeal. She sang traditional Mexican ballads and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2002 in the category of "Best Banda Album."
The lawsuits against Starwood focus on the man who signed the insurance paperwork on its behalf, Ed Nunez. Nunez's full name, the insurance companies claim, is Christian Edward Esquino Nunez, a businessman with a criminal record that includes falsifying airplane records.
The registered owner of Starwood, Norma Gonzalez, or her representatives were not immediately available.
In an unrelated lawsuit, Starwood admits that the company gave power of attorney to Ed Nunez to sign documents but denies that the man has any ownership or management role in the company. The sole member of Starwood is Norma Gonzalez, the court document states.
The pair of lawsuits from the insurance companies, however, tell another story.
The QBE lawsuit claims that Ed Nunez, also known as Christian Esquino, is the "alter ego" of Starwood, and that he is tied to the operations, assets and ownership of the firm in a way that makes him "inseparable" from the company.
The convicted businessman's history may be troublesome to observers of Sunday's crash.
Additional court records reviewed by CNN show that under the name Eduardo Nunez, the businessman was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2002 of falsifying logbooks to obtain airworthiness certificates from the Federal Aviation Administration. He pleaded guilty.
Esquino, a Mexican national, pleaded guilty in 2004 of participating in a scheme in which he "obtained a counterfeit Mexican inspection stamp, which was used to make entries in the fraudulently created logbooks, concerning the airworthiness for aircraft engines, propellers and airframes, as well as, certify completed 25-, 50- and 100-hour aircraft inspections," the criminal complaint states.
He sold those planes at a higher price, according to court records.
The Learjet in which Rivera was traveling, built in 1969, was not one of the aircraft cited in any of the legal action, records indicate.
Another case filed against Esquino in 1993 resulted in a conviction for "the concealment from the IRS of the existence, source and transfer of cash" for which he was sentenced to five years in prison.
According to court documents obtained by CNN, Esquino has a criminal record dating to 1991, when he pleaded guilty to one count of "aiding and abetting a false loan application." He was then sentenced to three years on probation.
Opinion: America missed out on getting to know Jenni Rivera
In April 1991, Esquino was arrested and subsequently indicted on one count of "conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine," according to court records. He pleaded guilty.
The insurance companies claim that they would not have provided coverage for Starwood if they had known about such a criminal history. They allege that Esquino simply went by the name Nunez instead and failed to report his past.
Civil aviation officials say they believe no one survived Sunday's crash. Yet Rivera's family says hope is the last thing to go.
Authorities would not describe the condition of the remains but said they do not know how many people they belong to.
The remains were found Tuesday at the site of the wreckage and were transported to Monterrey, the same city the private Learjet took off from, said Priscila Rivas, spokeswoman for the state's public ministry.
It is too early to tell if Rivera's remains were among those found, Rivas said, but DNA tests are under way. Test results could take anywhere from a day to weeks, she said.
Rivera's brother, Lupillo, arrived in Monterrey Tuesday from the family's home in Lakewood, California. Before he left California, he described the situation as "95% bad news" but added that the family is clinging to the small hope that Jenni Rivera somehow survived.
A makeshift altar with flowers, balloons and candles appeared on the family's front lawn.
"I trust in God, and he gives me strength," said Rivera's mother, Rosa Rivera. "I know that if indeed (she's dead), I would thank God for the time he shared her with me, for the precious time she called me Mother."
Six others, including two pilots, were thought to be on board the plane, which lost contact with air traffic controllers soon after takeoff.
Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera, 43, released her debut album in 1999, according to her website.
In October, People en Espanol named Rivera to its list of the 25 most powerful women.
Famous for her music, she is also known for her tumultuous personal life. The singer was a single mom at the age of 15, is thrice-married and the mother of five, her website said.
Rivera's "I Love Jenni" reality show began airing on Telemundo's mun2 network last year.
She is a judge on the popular TV show "The Voice Mexico," which was scheduled to air Sunday night on Televisa. Noting its concern for Rivera, Televisa said it would air a special report on the singer instead.
"To all her fans who are suffering, I say thank you, and don't suffer. Soon we will have news of her," Rosa Rivera said.

After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court?
By Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 7:49 AM EST, Fri February 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Passengers could sue Carnival, lawyers say
But filing a suit isn't easy
More than 3,000 passengers on Carnival Triumph have been stranded for five days
(CNN) -- Rather than getting the relaxing vacation they paid for, more than 3,000 passengers on Carnival Triumph have endured five days stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, smelling backed-up toilets and watching sewage slosh on deck.
"A floating petri dish" is how one passenger, a doctor, put it.
As tugboats bring the ship to Mobile, Alabama, on Thursday, many on board might be considering what to do next.
Could Carnival passengers sue the cruise line?
Passenger rights when cruises fail
Lawyer on Carnival: 'You're out of luck'
Carnival CEO: 'We failed'
The future for Carnival's leadership
They could, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said, but whether the claim has merit will depend on the paperwork they signed when they purchased their ticket.
Negligent infliction of emotional distress would be the main justification for a suit, said Jason R. Margulies, an experienced maritime lawyer based in Miami.
Tensions are high on board. There was the stress inflicted by the fire in the engine room, which began the mess, a scary experience for sure. Apart from the uncomfortable situation with bad smells, there is a risk of health problems because of poor sanitation. And passengers have reported minor fights. All of this is justification for going to court, Margulies said.
But it isn't that simple.
Five things we've learned about cruising
What can make suing a cruise line complicated?
Carnival has a prohibition on class-action suits in its tickets, information that wouldn't be obvious to passengers who didn't read the fine print when they bought tickets.
U.S. courts have said that ship owners and operators cannot put that language on tickets. But Carnival, though headquartered in Miami, is incorporated outside the United States, partly in Panama and Great Britain, experts say.
Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, so the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency.
Why did the rescue take five days?
What else is detailed on the ticket?
Carnival's ticket contract says the cruise line is not "liable to the passenger for damages for emotional distress, mental suffering/anguish or psychological injury of any kind under any circumstances, except when such damages were caused by the negligence of Carnival and resulted from the same passenger sustaining actual physical injury, or having been at risk of actual physical injury."
While no physical injuries have been reported, if a passenger contracted a significant disease such as hepatitis from unsanitary conditions aboard on the ship, maritime trial attorney John H. Hickey believes, physical injury could be argued.
"I think that a case can be made that everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury," he said.
Opinion: What cruise lines don't want you to know
What else should a passenger consider? Would it take a long time to see a resolution after filing suit?
It would be incredibly expensive for a lone plaintiff to sue. And no matter how a suit is brought, it would probably take two years for it to wind through court, Margulies said.
But it could still be done. Consider the case of Costa Concordia, the cruise liner that ran aground off Italy in January 2011. Thirty-two people were killed.
Many people from different countries sued the owners of the Concordia with varying results. In at least one example, the cruise liner reportedly offered to pay 11,000 euros to each of 235 French nationals affected.
Is there another remedy? Could passengers be compensated by their travel insurance?
Jason Clampet of travel site Skift.com said that's unlikely.
"Insurance really doesn't cover this sort of thing. Their trip wasn't interrupted, and they aren't incurring extra expenses ... so they can't be compensated that way," he said.
Opinion: How Carnival can clean up the PR mess
What does a passenger have to weigh before moving forward?
"In the real world, a big company like Carnival is going to want to try to make these passengers as happy as possible as quickly as possible," Toobin said.
The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home and a full refund for the trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise.
"Do these people want to take what Carnival is offering and get on with their lives," Toobin asked, "or do they want to get into a long legal struggle that may not yield the results they want?"

Polls suggest Congress might have waited too long on gun control
By Paul Steinhauser, CNN Political Editor
updated 1:31 PM EDT, Wed March 27, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Public support for new gun measures has fallen dramatically since Newtown massacre
Support spiked after elementary school shootings but has dropped by double digits since
Largest drop in support was among older Americans and those who live in rural areas
Washington (CNN) -- Is the clock ticking on gun control?
While support for many gun control policies remains high in the wake of the horrific shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, polls conducted over the past few weeks suggest that three-and-a-half months after the tragedy, public backing for major new gun laws overall appears to have dropped significantly.
A CBS News survey released earlier this week indicated a 10-point drop in the public backing of stricter gun laws, from 57% immediately after the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in December when a heavily armed gunman killed 20 young students and six adults, to 47% now.
That poll was in line with a CNN/ORC International survey released last week that indicated a nine-point drop in the percentage of Americans who favor major restrictions on guns or an outright ban on gun ownership, from 52% following the shootings to 43%.
Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown?
Other polls have shown changes within their sampling error but in the same downward direction.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in mid-March showed support for stricter gun laws moving from 54% to 52%. That two-point margin was within the survey's sampling error.
Why U.S. can't come together on gun laws
Filibuster on the horizon
Hickenlooper: Gun control 'a tough sell'
And a Fox News poll released last week indicated majority backing -- but some slippage -- in support for specific proposals like banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips.
"Opinion on gun control was fairly steady over the past few years, but seemed to spike after the Connecticut shootings," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. "The big question is whether support for major new gun laws has simply dropped back down to that previous level or whether the slide will continue even further."
So what's causing the drop in support? The surveys, including CNN's, offer clues.
Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings
"Support for stricter gun control has fallen dramatically among two groups -- older Americans and people who live in rural areas," Holland said. "In the immediate aftermath of the shootings in Connecticut, the number of rural Americans who supported major gun restrictions rose to 49% but now that support has dropped 22 points. Support for stricter gun laws dropped 16 points among Americans over 50 years old in that same time."
The new polls suggest that federal lawmakers pushing for gun control might have waited too long to act.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced late last week that he would move ahead on a bill that would expand background checks for gun sales and stiffen gun trafficking penalties when the Senate returns from the two-week recess it's currently taking. While national polling indicates extremely strong support for background checks, Reid's bill could face a very tough go of it in Democrat-controlled Senate, let alone the GOP-dominated House.

On China, Episode 11 transcript: Chinese women's rights
updated 1:12 AM EDT, Mon August 19, 2013
Guests (L-R) Joy Chen, Wu Qing, and Leta Hong Fincher discuss Chinese women's rights with host Kristie Lu Stout.
Editor's note: This month's episode of "On China" examines women's rights, premiering on Wednesday, August 21 at 5:30 pm HKT. Click here for airtimes. Marital property rights in China Women's rights in China What is 'love' in China? Who are China's 'leftover women?'
(CNN) -- This episode's guests include Joy Chen, author of "Do Not Marry Before 30"; Leta Hong Fincher, a scholar on Chinese women issues at Tsinghua University; and Wu Qing, a former People's Deputy to the Haidian People's Congress in Beijing.
Kristie: Leta Hong Fincher, Wu Qing and Joy Chen, welcome to On China.
Kristie: When Mao said women hold up half the sky, was that more than rhetoric, did he really want to emancipate women?
Wu: I don't think so, no, actually women make up half of the population right? And now women in China only make up 48.8% of the population. We lack 2.2% because normally in each country women should make up 51% because of different chromosomes. Women live longer. So you can see that a women's status is still low because boy babies are still favored. So in a way you know some people say Mao was just trying to use women because after 1949 women were encouraged to get into the labor force.
Kristie: But when we look at the gains Chinese women made during that period of time 50 years ago and we compare that to the situation now, do you feel that women's rights and gender equality has moved forward or taken a step back?
Joy: Well I think women should hold up half the sky now if you just look at their education gains. Business Week recently reported that business enrollment in the United States has risen because of women from China, so I think you can say that women from China are some of the best educated or the best educated group of people in the world. I think what we're seeing in Chinese society today though is as soon as they come back and try to put all of that education to use and use their potential, there's a huge amount of backlash that they face to jump back into the women's roles of thousands of years which is to be a wife and to be a mother which are the legitimate roles for women.
Kristie: One form of the backlash is the use of the term leftover women or xxx, what does it mean?
Leta: Well the term leftover women or xx was defined by the All China's Women's Federation in 2007. And it means an urban educated woman over the age of 27 who is still single and so after the women's federation defined this term then the state media started aggressively pushing it and basically there's been just a stream of reports insulting educated women in their late 20s who don't have a husband yet and the message is that they should all hurry up and get married, stop focusing on their careers, stop focusing on their educations and find a husband before time runs out and they get too old. So in my view actually women's rights have really been set back dramatically in the post Mao era.
Kristie: And the term leftover women I mean it's leftover as in spoiled food. It's very, very insulting isn't it?
Joy: I think it's insulting not just to single women, but it's insulting to all women and all men because it basically says you're legitimate to the extent you're married. It also says to all women that after the age of 25, 27 um you will no longer be beautiful. You will no longer be loved. You will no longer be valued as a human being. So hurry up, hurry up and get married before you're xx unmarriageable.
Kristie: Leta has pointed out that there's a state media campaign promoting leftover women. Why would state media promote this term and how are they doing it?
Leta: Well, when I looked into the origins of the term, I found that shortly before state media began promoting this term leftover women, the state council actually issued a very important population decision and it said that China faces a grave problem of the low quality of its population which means China will have a difficult time competing in the global marketplace. And so one of the strong priorities it set out was to upgrade overall population quality. And it enlisted a number of government agencies in this goal including the women's federation, the public security bureau, ministry of civil affairs, so across the board this was pronounced as a very important priority. We need to upgrade population quality which is called xx and that way we can raise higher quality, better educated children who will enable China to compete better in the global marketplace. And so my argument is that the leftover women term is part of this program to upgrade population equality. So what they want to do is promote match making to encourage or scare educated women into having a child because that fits the government's demographic goals.
Joy: The leftover label is everywhere in society. Your plumber tells you hurry and get married if you're a single woman with an apartment, your parents, everywhere in the media. I think there's a certain amount of carelessness that drives it. That since everybody's saying you just go ahead and report it or go ahead and continue saying it um but I think there's been a growing awareness especially in the last year that um this term is sexist and it's devaluing of all women. I think people have backed away from using it in government. I'm not sure that there's one policy that says we definitely have to use this and then another policy that says let's shift course.
Kristie: Now I need to bring in Wu Wing into this. Wu Qing you have been a tireless legislator, human rights activist, a witness to so much history in China - when you look at this trend of the campaigning of the use of the words leftover women, these various messages are being put out there for women in China, what do you make of it?
Wu: Number one I think it's not people friendly because we also have leftover men as well. Number two; it's discriminatory against women because I feel that most important thing is that we lack purpose in life. Marriage is only part of one's life. We need to have a very clear goal in our life, what you want. and then the criteria of getting a man and I think it's important for women to be confident in herself. I was lucky that when I was a little girl my mom told me that I'm a human being first before I'm a girl or a woman.
Kristie: I think if we talk about gender equality in China, I'd like to talk about the life cycle of a typical Chinese and when I say typical Chinese woman, we're going to focus on an urban Chinese woman. So that means we go back to the very beginning: birth. And that means we have to talk about the one child policy. Is it still the case even in the urban areas that the preference is for boys over girls still today?
Wu: I would say it depends. In bigger cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, the municipalities a lot of men favor girl babies because there's a saying, "Having a daughter is like having a cotton padded coat for you in winter to keep you warm," but a lot of people still want boys. // But now actually I think the policy is changing. A couple from one child families could have a second child so the policy is changing. Because I think the most important thing is parenting is important. How do you bring up a child? I think it's important to bring up a global citizen who should know about his or her rights as well as responsibilities. Not being the center of a family or the center of one's self. It's not enough.
Kristie: There's that pressure to return to traditional roles after you get married, but I'm also reading that in urban areas a number of Chinese women's desire to marry is not quite much there any more is that true?
Leta: Absolutely, in fact I think this is one of the big reasons why the government came up with this leftover term is because as you rightly said women are better educated in China than ever before or in history. This is a tremendous accomplishment over the past two decade. So what happens when a woman becomes better educated? Of course she wants to delay marriage. Of course she wants to advance her career for a few years. She doesn't want to rush into marrying somebody and having a child immediately.
Joy: I think there's also this question about the word love // And I think that for a woman that was a role, for thousands of years marriage was the only source of security, stability, legitimacy. It's hard to even imagine what a woman's life would be like if she didn't get married. So I think there's also just this cultural lag, so I think that in our relationships there's never been a real emphasis on love, a romantic love and what that means. There's more of a focus on honor. Now, suddenly in the last ten years we talk about love all of the time. There are 22 dating shows until recently on TV. Everybody wants to fall in love and be in love forever and there's never been much discussion of what is a marriage and what does love mean you know? And what does it mean to love our own selves and what does it mean to love a man.
Kristie: So when you look at relationships and look at what young modern women want to find in a relationship is the emphasis more on financial success and stability then personal fulfillment or that's what the messages are telling them they should value.
Wu: I think the message is very clear. It's about money, wealth and power. And that's why I think it's a failure in education because// as I said marriage is only part of life. You have to be yourself and very often people have to know that love means responsibility. It's not just love for loves sake. What is love? It's responsibility. It's when two people come together they share their life they share a lot of interests. Or each has to have enough space for you know for themselves.
Kristie: I agree and when looking for a spouse of course there needs to be that passionate love, but also that responsibility, that mutual responsibility to live a fulfilling life with one another. I can't help but think that the recent research by horizon research group saying 3/4 of all women profiled in this study in coastal areas in China said that in choosing a husband they'd consider his ability to buy a home. Does that jive with what you've learned with what Chinese women want?
Leta: There are a lot of damaging myths out there about Chinese women and one of them is that Chinese women are so greedy all their looking for in a man is a man without a lot of money and a man that can bring a house to them so they can sit back and get rich for the rest of their lives without working. This is a completely myth. So what is happening is parents believe this myth, so parents tend to buy these incredibly valuable homes for their sons because they believe their son has to own a home in order to attract a bride. But what really happens is that over 70% of women actually contribute heavily to the marital home and yet only 30% of married women actually have their name included in the property deed. So basically these women are financing the home purchase, but their forfeiting ownership of the home. And so what's really happening is that women are being completely shut out of this dramatic accumulation of real-estate wealth and it actually is worth over 28 trillion US dollars as the end of last year. This is probably the creation of the biggest gender wealth gap ever in history and women are missing out on it. In 2011 the supreme court just unilaterally says oh, well whoever's name is on the deed gets to keep the home in the event of the divorce so all of those women have no legal claim to that home even though they haven't financed it and then that gets into another whole range of problems like domestic violence.
Kristie: That's right because when the name isn't on the deed they lose bargaining power in the relationship and you have many women stuck in very unhealthy relationships and because of this arrangement they don't want to get out
Leta: Or they want to get out, but it's really, really difficult
Kristie: Why is the government not doing anything to promote gender equality in China and what can it do?
Wu: You know I think our government has not been um trying hard enough to implement the constitution. Because the Chinese constitution article 33 says every single citizen of the People's Republic of China should be treated equally and the article 48 especially on women, women should enjoy equal rights in the economy, in politics, in everything and yet now China is still rule of man by man. That's why there's a lot of work to be done to popularize human rights especially girls and women should be treated equally.
Kristie: Women's rights are enshrined in China's constitution as you pointed out and the reason why it hasn't been implemented is it because of the lack of female representation at the top?
Wu: Now if you look at the standing committee members, the seven something, all men...so when it comes to women's issues who will speak for women?//Rights are given or granted. You have to stand up for it and to me I feel in China you have to fight for your rights in every step of the way or every inch of the way forward.
Joy: One thing we can't avoid looking at is the mandatory retirement age for women in this country of 55. that is so young and I think that that is something that is really pushing the upper generation to pressure people to get married and have kids because they have nothing to do but take care of their future grandchildren.
Kristie: Is there a mandatory retirement age for men as well?
Joy: There is, but it's a few years older you know 55 for women
Wu: Five to ten years older than women. For workers it's age 50 or 45 it depends on the work.
Joy: It depends on the work, depends on the different sections of the SOE you're working for
Kristie: And the rationale behind that is oh, it's time for you to be a grandmother, go home
Joy: I don't know what the rationale is
Leta: Partly it's that women have always been seen as surplus labor, that men have always been seen as the primary employees. So in the early years of the communist era, they pushed women into the work force because they needed them//Then in the 1990s when you had this massive restructuring of the state owned enterprises and millions and millions of workers were laid off, women were first to go. Women were fired in far greater numbers than men.
Kristie: You know what's incredible is that despite so much pressure from the government and lack of government support and social pressure and everything else that there are outliers, these extreme examples of incredible success for example seven out of ten of the world's most wealthy self-made billionaires come from China so how did they come to be? What pushed them to go so far?
Leta: These women who are multi-millionaires have made it in spite of being in China not because of it and I wish that those women would speak out more on behalf of women all across China, but by and large they tend not to say that because I personally believe they don't want to talk about how difficult it is for them.
Kristie: I'm very curious to hear from W your thoughts, 50 years ago you were 20 years old in your 20s, do you think it was a more, I don't want to be guilty of nostalgia, but do you think it was a better time to be a young woman then compared to now?
Wu: Worse, because I wasn't myself. That was in 1957, I was 20 years old. My dad was labeled a rightest. Because he came out and criticize the party. In fact, he had been encouraged to put forward suggestions or to criticize whatever the party had done wrong. He was encouraged and yet after he said something he was labeled a rightest and at that time my mom, someone told my mom to divorce my dad and my mom said how can I divorce him? We thought a like. And then I became an untouchable. So I went through all of that, went through all of the political movements you know that kind of thing. That's why I want to change and that's why I've been telling people that I'm a verb, I'm not a noun or an adjective
Kristie: Which verb are you?
Wu: I just want to take action to change. Change China from a country rule of man by man to become a country rule of law by law.
Kristie: What do you think are the prospects for gender equality in China? Are you optimistic or are you fearful?
Leta: Personally, from my own research I'm quite pessimistic of the status of women. That doesn't mean that I don't have hope. I am really heartened when I come across these young women who say I know it says kind of radical, but they say I don't want to get married. Marriage is a bad institution in China right now and I want to focus on myself and I want freedom and I want to do what I believe in. And I really hope that more and more women will have the faith and self confidence in themselves and perhaps there will be a genuine women's rights movement.
Kristie: Are you more optimistic?
Joy: Um well I think it will take a long time for women to reach equality, legal equality, but I think that women are starting to recognize who they are. And maybe starting with the women who feel economically secure starting to recognize themselves that it's important to first become miss right and to create their own lives then think about finding love. Love being the emphasis as opposed to some other institution to reply on. I'm optimistic that this is starting to happen in the big cities where women have achieved, educated women who have achieved a measure of economic success. Um and I am optimistic that these women are starting to talk with their friends and there's a conversation that's starting to happen.
Kristie: Final thought from you
Wu: I'm optimistic especially in the long term point of view because the world is changing. China is part of the global village. The world is changing and then women are learning in the hard way sometimes. They have to learn to protect themselves. It's often the government or sectors of the government or big corporations are violating their rights. They are learning. They are learning to protect their own rights and then that's why it's so important to change the content and methodology of education to offer them um legal training as well as gender training for both boys and girls to learn to respect each other as human beings as human rights should be the base of everything.

Adoptive parents sentenced in the rapes of their two children
By Kevin Conlon, CNN
updated 10:46 AM EDT, Tue September 24, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Joseph and Linda Mayotte of Massachusetts were convicted last month
Prosecutor says Linda Mayotte became pregnant by her adoptive son, who was 15
He faces 16 to 20 years in prison; she faces 18 to 22 years
Now 21, the adoptive son reportedly said in court: 'Let them burn in hell'
(CNN) -- A Massachusetts husband and wife were each sentenced to prison Monday after being found guilty last month of raping their two adopted children.
Joseph Mayotte, 50, sexually abused his daughter over a five-year span, starting when she was 8, according to a news release from prosecutor Joseph D. Early Jr.
Mayotte was convicted in August on 11 charges -- including rape of a child aggravated by age difference -- and was sentenced Monday to 16 to 20 years in prison.
His wife, Linda Mayotte, was convicted on 19 charges -- including three counts of rape of a child -- and sentenced from 18 to 22 years behind bars.
The 49-year-old became pregnant with her adopted son's child when he was only 15, according to Paul Jarvey of the Worcester County District Attorney's Office. It was a pregnancy she carried to term, Jarvey said.
"Let them burn in hell," is what the son, now 21, said of his former parents in an impact statement read in court today, according to Jarvey.
The Mayottes, who lived in the central Massachusetts town of Northbridge, were arrested in 2009. The two adopted children -- along with the child to whom Linda Mayotte gave birth -- were adopted by other families.
"Their trust was broken by these two predators," Early's statement said. "Now, justice has been served."

Airlines and airports look to take the pain out of boarding planes
By Jenny Soffel, for CNN
updated 10:31 PM EST, Tue December 17, 2013
Ready, set, scramble: Bulky hand luggage and priority boarding could be causing more delays, not less.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Airlines have tried for years to find more efficient ways to board a plane
Some innovative methods involve self-boarding and assigning individual boarding numbers
Even an astrophysicist has tried to calculate the quickest way to board (CNN) -- What's the most efficient way to board a plane? Rear to front, randomly or by adapting scientifically calculated methods?
Over the years airlines have experimented with ways to get passengers seated as quickly as possible, but only with recent technology have some real alternatives been made possible.
Research by Boeing showed that the pace at which passengers board a plane has slowed by 50% since 1970. Reasons might include a longer list of priority boarders and more carry-on baggage blocking the aisles.
Quicker boarding time means airlines save money; $30 for every minute saved, according to studies.
"Planes make money in the air, not on the ground," Jan van Helden, project leader for KLM's "Smarter Boarding" program told CNN.
So, is there an ultimate boarding method? Not yet, but here are some of the efforts that have been made by airports, airlines and even one astrophysicist.
DIY boarding
Passengers traveling with South African Airways from Heathrow airport took part of a two month self-boarding trial earlier this year that used biometric data.
Before boarding, passengers went through an electronic barrier that scanned their faces. The scan was then compared to an earlier face scan carried out during check-in or security. If the biometric data matched, the passenger could board.

"The specific application of this trial is to remove the need for a passport check," Mark Walker, passenger process program manager at Heathrow, told CNN.
He said the trial resulted in good transaction time for the airline.
"In the future there is a real opportunity for airlines to say that rather than having their staff checking passports and boarding passes, they can instead use the time to add real value to the journey of the passenger."
The 'positive' approach
Another new boarding technique being tried at London's busiest airport is called "Positive Boarding." It has been put to the test by Virgin Atlantic and United Airlines.
Passenger data is collected when boarding passes are scanned at security. The system then sends this data to the airlines, which then verifies if the passenger is in the correct terminal and how much time they have to reach their gate.

Messages are also sent to the passenger to inform them of the flight status.
"This allows the airlines to more quickly determine if a passenger is too late to board, so they can make a decision if they are going to offload a bag," explained Walker.
The cheese counter method
Dutch airline KLM claim to be the first carrier to come up with an innovative boarding technique they call "Smart Boarding."
"The breakthrough idea we had was to translate each passenger's seat number into a sequence number," said van Helden.
The numbers are then displayed on a big screen at the departure gate at five-second intervals, allowing only one person at a time to board the plane.

So far "Smart Boarding" has been used daily on three European flights departing from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.
"It works very well for us and we board faster, 20% faster," van Helden said.
The astrophysicist's solution
When standing in line to board a plane, Jason Steffen, astrophysicist at Fermi National Laboratory in Illinois, wondered if there wasn't a better way to go about it. He tested different methods in computer simulations and came up with a method suggesting boarding in alternate rows, from rear to front, and window to aisle.
"The test we did, where we involved real people, showed that my method was twice as efficient as the common rear to front method," Steffen said.
"There was a recent show where they tested my method against that of Southwest Airlines, and mine was about 30% faster."

Constipation
Filed under: Digestive Health
Constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools. Constipation is a common gastrointestinal problem. What's considered normal frequency for bowel movements varies widely. In general, however, you're probably experiencing constipation if you pass fewer than three stools a week, and your stools are hard and dry. Fortunately, most cases of constipation are temporary. Simple lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, drinking more fluids and eating a high-fiber diet, can go a long way toward alleviating constipation. Constipation may also be treated with over-the-counter laxatives. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Symptoms
Not having a bowel movement every day doesn't necessarily mean you're constipated. You likely have constipation, however, if you've had at least two of the following signs and symptoms for at least three of the past six months: Pass fewer than three stools a week
Experience hard stools
Strain excessively during bowel movements
Experience a sense of rectal blockage
Have a feeling of incomplete evacuation after having a bowel movement
Need to use manual maneuvers to have a bowel movement, such as finger evacuation or manipulation of your lower abdomen
When to see a doctor Although constipation may be bothersome, it's usually not serious. Most people who have constipation don't seek a doctor's care. However, chronic constipation may lead to complications or be a sign of a serious underlying disorder. See your doctor if you experience an unexplained onset of constipation or change in bowel habits, or if symptoms are severe and last longer than three weeks. Also seek medical care if you experience any of the following signs or symptoms, which might indicate a more serious health problem: Bowel movements occurring more than three days apart, despite corrective changes in diet or exercise
Intense abdominal pain
Blood in your stool
Constipation that alternates with diarrhea
Rectal pain
Thin, pencil-like stools
Unexplained weight loss

Causes
Constipation most commonly occurs when waste or stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract, causing it to become hard and dry. Normally, the waste products of digestion (stool) are propelled through your intestines by muscle contractions. In the large intestine (colon), most of the water and salt in this waste mixture are reabsorbed because they're essential for many of your body's functions. However, when there is not enough fluid or fiber-rich food in your diet — or if the colon's muscle contractions are slow — the stool hardens, dries and passes through your colon too slowly. This is the root cause of constipation. You may also experience constipation if the muscles you use to move your bowels aren't properly coordinated. This problem is called pelvic floor dysfunction (anismus), and it causes you to strain with most bowel movements — even soft ones. A number of factors can cause an intestinal slowdown, including: Inadequate fluid intake or dehydration
Inadequate amounts of fiber in your diet
Ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement or delaying until later
Lack of physical activity (especially in older adults)
Irritable bowel syndrome
Changes in lifestyle or routine, including pregnancy, aging and travel
Illness
Frequent use or misuse of laxatives
Specific diseases, such as stroke, diabetes, thyroid disease and Parkinson's disease
Problems with the colon and rectum, such as intestinal obstruction or diverticulosis
Certain medications, including pain medications, diuretics and those used to treat Parkinson's disease, high blood pressure and depression
Hormonal disturbances, such as an underactive thyroid gland
Anal fissures and hemorrhoids, which can produce a spasm of the anal sphincter muscle
Loss of body salts through vomiting or diarrhea
Injuries to the spinal cord, which can affect the nerves that lead to and from the intestine
In rare cases, constipation may signal more-serious medical conditions, such as colorectal cancer, hormonal disturbances or autoimmune diseases. In children, constipation might indicate Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital condition that results from missing nerve cells in the colon. Children may also become constipated if they are afraid of or unwilling to use the toilet. Older children may ignore or forget to attend to bowel movements. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Risk factors
You're more likely to have constipation if you are: An older adult
Sedentary
Confined to bed
Eating a diet that's low in fiber
Not getting adequate fluids
Taking certain medications, including sedatives, narcotics or certain medications to lower blood pressure
Undergoing chemotherapy
Women are more frequently affected by constipation, and children more than adults. If you're pregnant, you may have bouts of constipation because of hormonal changes. Later in your pregnancy, pressure on your intestines from your expanding uterus also can cause constipation. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com.
Complications
Although constipation can be extremely bothersome, it usually isn't serious. If it persists, and especially if straining results, you may develop certain complications: Hemorrhoids or cracks (fissures) in your anus may result when hard stool stretches the sphincter muscle.
Fecal impaction occurs when you accumulate a mass of hardened stool that can't be eliminated by a normal bowel movement. You may need to have impacted stool removed manually.
Rectal prolapse occurs when a small amount of rectal tissue pushes out through the anus. This condition may lead to a secretion of mucus from the anus. Lazy bowel syndrome may occur if you use laxatives frequently, causing your bowels to become dependent on them for proper function. Laxative use can also lead to other problems, including poor absorption of vitamins and other nutrients and damage to your intestinal tract.

Preparing for your appointment
You'll likely first seek medical care for constipation from your family doctor or general practitioner. You may be referred to a specialist in digestive disorders (gastroenterologist) if your doctor suspects a more advanced case of constipation. Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor. What you can do Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restricting your diet or eating certain high-fiber foods to prepare for diagnostic testing.
Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to constipation.
Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes, such as traveling or becoming pregnant.
Make a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins, supplements or herbal medications, that you're taking.
Take a family member or friend along. Sometimes it can be difficult to absorb all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
Write down questions to ask your doctor.
Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions ahead of time will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important, in case time runs out. For constipation, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?
Are there other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?
What kinds of tests do I need?
What treatment approach do you recommend?
What other treatment options exist?
How soon do you expect my symptoms to improve with treatment?
I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?
Should I see a gastroenterologist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?
Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment. What to expect from your doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may allow more time to go over additional questions you may have. Your doctor may ask: When did you begin experiencing symptoms of constipation?
Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
How severe are your symptoms?
What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?
Do your symptoms include abdominal pain?
Do your symptoms include vomiting?
Have you recently lost weight without trying?
Do you see blood with your bowel movements mixed in with the stool, in the toilet water or on the toilet paper?
Do you strain with your bowel movements?
Do you have any family history of digestive problems or colon cancer?
Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
Have you started any new medications or recently changed the dosage of your current medications?
What you can do in the meantime Be aware that certain diagnostic tests may require advance preparation. For example, people undergoing marker studies will need to eat a high-fiber diet while abstaining from laxatives for a certain period of time before the test. Consult your doctor for specific instructions before an office visit. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Tests and diagnosis
Your doctor will take your medical history, perform a physical exam and ask about any prescription or over-the-counter medications you're taking. Your doctor will also want to rule out several conditions in diagnosing constipation. These include a blockage in your small intestine or colon (intestinal obstruction), a narrowing of the colon, an endocrine condition, such as hypothyroidism, or an electrolyte disturbance, such as excessive calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). Extensive testing is usually reserved for people with severe symptoms or for older adults with new-onset constipation. You may undergo these diagnostic procedures: Barium enema X-ray. In this test, the lining of your bowel is coated with a contrast dye (barium) so that your rectum, colon and sometimes a part of the small intestine can be clearly seen on an X-ray.
X-ray of the anorectal area (defecography). In this X-ray procedure, your doctor will fill your rectum with a soft paste with the same consistency as stool. As you expel the paste, X-rays are taken to evaluate the completeness of stool elimination and rectal muscle contractions.
Examination of the rectum and lower, or sigmoid, colon (sigmoidoscopy). In this procedure, your doctor inserts a lighted, flexible tube into your anus to examine your rectum and the lower portion of your colon.
Examination of the rectum and entire colon (colonoscopy). This diagnostic procedure allows your doctor to examine the entire colon with a flexible, camera-equipped tube.
Evaluation of anal sphincter muscle function (anorectal manometry). In this procedure, your doctor inserts a narrow, flexible tube into your anus and rectum and then inflates a small balloon at the tip of the tube. The device is then pulled back through the sphincter muscle. This procedure allows your doctor to measure the coordination of the muscles you use to move your bowels.
Evaluation of how well food moves through the colon (marker study or colorectal transit study). In this procedure, you'll swallow a capsule containing markers that show up on X-rays taken over several days. Your doctor will look for signs of intestinal muscle dysfunction and how well food moves through your colon.

Treatments and drugs
In most cases, simple changes in your diet and lifestyle can help relieve symptoms and manage constipation. Less often, you may need medical treatment. Above all, recognize that a successful treatment program can take time and effort. Diet and lifestyle changes The following simple changes can go a long way toward reducing constipation: A high-fiber diet. A diet with at least 20 to 35 grams of fiber each day helps your body form soft, bulky stool. High-fiber foods include beans, whole grains, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Limit foods that have little to no fiber, such as cheese, meat and processed foods.
Regular exercise. Physical activity can help stimulate intestinal activity.
Adequate fluid intake. Drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help soften your stool.
Take the time for bowel movements. Set aside sufficient time to allow undisturbed visits to the toilet. And don't ignore the urge to have a bowel movement.
Laxatives These over-the-counter medications should be considered only when diet and lifestyle changes aren't effective. Some can become habit-forming. There are several different types of laxatives: Fiber supplements, or bulk laxatives, are generally considered the safest of laxatives. Examples include FiberCon, Metamucil, Konsyl, Serutan and Citrucel. These agents must be taken with plenty of water.
Stimulants cause rhythmic contractions in the intestines. Examples include Correctol, Dulcolax and Senokot.
Lubricants enable stool to move through your colon more easily. Examples include mineral oil and Fleet.
Stool softeners moisten the stool and help prevent dehydration. Examples include Colace and Surfak.
Osmotics help fluids to move through the colon. Examples include Cephulac, Sorbitol and Miralax.
Saline laxatives act like a sponge to draw water into the colon for easier passage of stool. Examples include milk of magnesia and Haley's M-O.
Other medications If lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications don't improve your symptoms, your doctor may recommend prescription medications, such as: Chloride channel activators. The agent lubiprostone (Amitiza) is available by prescription and increases fluid content of stool.
5-HT-4 agonists. These agents stimulate release of compounds in your body that increase fluid secretion in the intestines and decrease colonic transit time. Prucalopride is one such 5-HT-4 agonist. These drugs are not available in the U.S., and there have been some concerns about the safety of their use.
Procedures If your constipation doesn't respond to changes in lifestyle or medical treatment, your doctor may recommend in-office or, rarely, surgical procedures. Manual procedures. To help clear your colon of retained, impacted stool if laxatives are not effective, your doctor may first gently insert a gloved finger and manually break up the impacted stool (disimpaction). Next, you'll be given a laxative enema to soften the stool and provide lubrication for a bowel movement. Surgical procedures. If you have chronic, severe constipation and other treatments haven't helped, surgical removal of part of your colon may be recommended. In this procedure, the problem segment or segments of the anal sphincter or rectum are removed.
Treating underlying causes If an underlying disorder is causing your constipation, treatment will be aimed at the specific cause. If pelvic floor dysfunction is the cause of your constipation, your doctor may suggest biofeedback as a treatment. This retraining technique may help you learn to better coordinate the muscles you use to have a bowel movement. If you're pregnant and have constipation, try eating lots of high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Drink plenty of fluids and get as much exercise as you can. Discuss with your doctor any plan, including exercise, to treat your constipation. Swimming and walking may be good choices. ©1998-2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.

Alternative medicine
In many cases, simple changes to your lifestyle and diet can help relieve the symptoms of constipation. Several alternative approaches may also provide relief, although they have not been studied extensively. Massage. Massage works by manipulating, compressing and stretching the skin, muscles and joints. Techniques include acupressure and shiatsu. When applied to the abdominal area, massage may help relax the muscles that support the bladder and intestines and help promote bowel activity.
Acupuncture. This traditional Chinese medicine involves the insertion and manipulation of fine needles in various parts of the body. The therapy may help stimulate the colon and relieve pain from constipation, although its efficacy for this has not been proved. Homeopathic remedies. Homeopathy is a holistic, nontoxic system of medicine that's individualized to your symptoms. Numerous homeopathic remedies exist for constipation, and they typically consist of plant-based laxatives. However, just because they're natural doesn't mean they're safe. For example, many herbal supplements are associated with dangerous drug interactions and side effects. Always talk with your doctor before trying a new homeopathic remedy.

Prevention
To help prevent constipation: Eat a high-fiber diet. Choose lots of high-fiber foods, including fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole-grain cereals and breads. Aim to consume 20 to 35 grams of fiber daily. Experiment to see if particular fruits or vegetables have a laxative effect for you. Remember to add fiber to your diet gradually to help reduce related gas and bloating.
Limit low-fiber foods. Foods that are high in fat and sugar and those that tend to be low in fiber content, such as ice cream, cheese and processed foods, may cause or aggravate constipation.
Drink plenty of liquids. The exact amount of water and other fluids you should drink each day varies and depends on your age, sex, health, activity level and other factors. Limit caffeine intake, which can worsen symptoms of constipation by causing dehydration.
Exercise regularly. Engage in regular physical exercise, such as walking, biking or swimming, to help stimulate intestinal function. Getting at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week is recommended.
Heed nature's call. Don't ignore the urge to have a bowel movement. The longer you delay, the more water is absorbed from your stool and the harder it becomes.
Try fiber supplements. Over-the-counter products, such as Metamucil and Citrucel, can help keep stools soft and regular. Be sure to drink plenty of water or other fluids every day, as taking fiber supplements without drinking plenty of fluids may worsen constipation.
Be careful about introducing stimulant laxatives. Habitual use of agents such as Correctol and Dulcolax can make your colon dependent on them and may require increasing dosages, eventually leading to problems with your intestines. For occasional relief try a saline laxative, such as milk of magnesia, which draws water into the colon to lubricate the stool. Avoid giving children laxatives without a doctor's approval.
