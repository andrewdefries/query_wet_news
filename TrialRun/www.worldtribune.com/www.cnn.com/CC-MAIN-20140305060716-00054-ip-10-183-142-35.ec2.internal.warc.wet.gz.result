Delaying pregnancy can carry consequencesStory Highlights More women delaying childbearing, which may make conceiving more difficult A woman has about a 15 percent chance of conceiving each month Lifestyle changes may boost woman's fertility long before she's "trying" Don't smoke or abuse drugs, get to a healthy weight, take folic acid Next Article in Health » Read VIDEO By Judy Fortin CNN Medical Correspondent ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Kelli Heath just turned 30 and she's spending more and more time deflecting questions from family and friends about when she plans to get pregnant. Scott and Kelli Heath, married two years, are delaying having children so they can have "us" time. "A lot of women have timelines," Heath said. "I don't." Heath, a full-time event planner in Atlanta, Georgia, married her husband, Scott, two years ago. They want to have children one day, but not right away. "Our priority as a couple is 'us' right now," she said. More and more couples like the Heaths are waiting to expand their families until the woman is well into her 30s or older. Work, travel and the desire to save money are some of the reasons cited for the delay in having a baby. Health Minute

Obstetrician and gynecologist Michael Randell cautioned that such delays may come with consequences. "There is a lot of anxiety among patients," Randell said. "I have 20-year-olds coming to me concerned whether or not they can get pregnant." In reality, experts say, women over 35 struggle the most to get pregnant. As a woman ages, the quality of her eggs tends to decline and she may not ovulate as frequently. "Statistics are against you," Randell said. "You only have a 15 percent chance of conceiving each month. About 85 percent of people will conceive in the first year of trying." "The reason why it is more difficult to get pregnant these days is more people are waiting longer." He also blamed monthly timing. "It's one of the most shocking things that I see, when patients really don't know that they only have a small window of opportunity to get pregnant each month. The optimal time of the month for ovulation is 14 days after the first day of your last menstrual period." Randell tells his patients that certain lifestyle changes may help improve a woman's fertility and get her body ready long before she is prepared to get pregnant. "If you're smoking, that can affect fertility both for the male and female; so can using drugs," he said. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests trying to lose weight if you are overweight or obese, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Taking a folic acid supplement before conception is important to prevent birth defects. Health Minute: Watch more on having a healthy pregnancy » Check to make sure your immunizations are up to date to lower the risk of infection while pregnant. Finally, Randell recommends couples relax and give it some time. "If you haven't been successful in 12 months of trying, then it is time to seek help," he said. Don't Miss Health Minute archive
The problem, he noted: "No one wants to wait 12 months. Most patients are asking for testing at three months." Randell starts by taking a woman's menstrual history. He then performs basic testing to determine whether a woman is ovulating properly. A blood test measures the amount of hormones in the blood. X-rays will be taken to see whether the woman's fallopian tubes are open. The male partner would be checked for an abnormal sperm count. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Preconception center
If ovulation is not occurring in the woman, then doctors will start investigating whether there is a medical reason and how to solve it. Randell said one of the most common problems he sees involves an improperly working thyroid gland. Randell explained another step may be to prescribe a fertility drug such as Clomid, which stimulates ovulation. If that doesn't work, Randell will refer the couple to an infertility doctor called a reproductive endocrinologist. Now that she's 30, Heath knows she's in the prime of her reproductive years. Rather than fret over a ticking biological clock and potential complications she said, "We'll cross that bridge when we get there."

Why your brain can't always make good decisionsStory Highlights Some decisions are best made through careful calculation, others through intuition Humans consistently misperceive chance in problems like coin tosses People also tend to ignore certain situational factors in making judgments Next Article in Health » By Elizabeth Landau CNN	(CNN) -- We all make bad decisions sometimes. In some contexts, to a certain extent, psychologists know why. Chess players, with experience, learn how to make rapid judgments about their moves. Much research on the subject was done by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for their models of how intuitive reasoning is flawed in predictable ways. Kahneman is now professor emeritus at Princeton University, and Tversky died in 1996. But other researchers are working on showing that, when it comes to more basic judgments, we're not so bad. Research in the current issue of the journal Neuron offers a mathematical model for how people make decisions about visual stimuli on a computer screen. They found that humans make accurate judgments about cues they can see. "We're discovering that humans aren't so stupid after all," said Alexandre Pouget, co-author of the study and associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester in New York. Participants were asked to look at moving dots on a screen. Many of the dots moved randomly, but some moved in one clear direction. Researchers found that people very quickly realized which way the non-random dots were going. The work complements that of Kahneman and Tversky in that it shows humans are good at lower-level, nonlinguistic tasks, while perhaps not so good at higher-level probability problems involving words, he said. "In simple perceptual decisions -- you have a visual stimulus on the screen and you have to make decisions about it -- it looks like you do accumulate the evidence optimally, given that uncertainty," Pouget said. Psychologists believe the human mind has two systems for decision-making: intuitive and reasoning. The intuitive system is emotional, fast, automatic but slow-learning, while the reasoning system is emotionally-neutral, slow, controlled, and rule-governed. Neither, of course, is always right, but there are certain simple problems that reveal flaws in intuition. A classic example that Kahneman has often used in lectures is this math problem: A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Your intuitive system may quickly tell you that the ball costs 10 cents. That would be an easy solution, but it would also be incorrect. In fact, if the ball costs 10 cents, that would mean the bat costs $1.10, so the two together would be $1.20 -- violating the first piece of information you had. A little algebra, or a little more thought, reveals that the ball must have cost 5 cents. Oops. Don't Miss Study: Racism still tolerated
Putting a price on procrastination
Now, think about tossing a coin six times. Which is more likely: heads-heads-heads-tails-tails-tails or tails-tails-heads-heads-tails-heads? You might think that the second one seems more random, so it's more likely. That error would fall into what Kahneman and Tversky would call the representativeness heuristic or, more specifically, the misconception of chance -- in other words, we tend to go on our intuitive notions of what an unrigged coin toss should look like rather than actually calculating. If you think about the probabilities of each, you'll realize the two combinations are equally likely. A related concept is called fundamental attribution error, demonstrated by Edward Jones and Victor Harris in 1967. The researchers gave people texts, some of which opposed Fidel Castro and some of which supported him. Most subjects said the writers held the beliefs expressed in the essay, even after the experimenters told them that an instructor or experimenter had previously dictated the essay's stance to the writer. The point is that the subjects did not take into the account all of the situational factors when making a decision about the writers' attitudes. Intuition is not always wrong. Expert chess players, for example, develop extraordinary speed in making moves, and learn to instantly recognize the available moves and strategies based on the board. Team sports players operate in much the same way. There are, however, limits to what intuition can offer. Experts say it's important to distinguish between decisions that should be made by intuition and those that require careful calculation. "With respect to accuracy, it all depends on the nature of the decision. I would not rely on my gut judgment when picking stock options for my retirement portfolio, for example," said Alexander Todorov, assistant professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University. Some of the most remarkable mental feats are done entirely without awareness, such as color vision, said Eldar Shafir, professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University. Other tasks require more effort, with less impressive results -- for example, humans can't navigate as well as a honeybee, which has a brain the size of the head of a pin. Todorov and Shafir both said the conclusions of Pouget's moving dot study -- that people make good decisions about certain perceptual problems -- make sense. "We -- like every other biological organism -- do some things remarkably well, and often unbeknownst to us. Other things, we do remarkably badly, even if we might think -- sometimes with great confidence -- otherwise," Shafir said. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Deliberations continue in Catholic child abuse cover-up case
By Sarah Hoye, CNN
updated 4:26 AM EDT, Mon June 4, 2012
Catholic Monsignor William Lynn faces accusations that he failed to keep priests accused of sexual abuse away from minors.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
William Lynn is the highest-ranking cleric to be charged with child endangerment If convicted, he faces up to 21 years in prison
Also on trial is the Rev. James Brennan, who is accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old
Philadelphia (CNN) -- Deliberations resume Monday in Philadelphia in the landmark trial of Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric charged with endangering children by allegedly helping cover up sexual abuse.
Lynn, a defendant with another Philadelphia priest, is accused of knowingly allowing dangerous priests to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children.
Also on trial is the Rev. James Brennan, who is accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old. Both Brennan and Lynn have pleaded not guilty.
Closing arguments in the case concluded Thursday and jurors began their deliberations Friday.
Philadelphia priest abuse trial a test case for Catholic church
Lynn's defense team argues that the monsignor repeatedly sent word of child sex abuse up the chain of command.
Catholic Church official to stand trial Philly priest sex abuse case cover-up?
He operated under strict orders from the late Archbishop Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and never had the power to remove a priest from ministry, the defense team argues.
It said Lynn was never formally trained to handle child sex abuse allegations and learned on the job.
"The allegation is that he did nothing, but he didn't do nothing," said Thomas Bergstrom, Lynn's defense attorney
"They want you to convict him for their sins. He held more than a candle to their shame, he put a spotlight on their shame," Bergstrom told jurors.
Lynn donned his clerical garb, surrounded by numerous family members, priest friends and parishioners inside the courtroom.
Lynn is the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for allegedly shuffling predator priests from parish to parish.
If convicted, he faces up to 21 years in prison.
Now-defrocked priest Edward Avery was due to go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but he pleaded guilty in March after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year.
Avery, 69, was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years in prison.
More than 60 witnesses and alleged victims of clergy abuse have testified since the criminal trial began March 26.
Accusers for Brennan and Avery have claims that fall within the statute of limitations.
Brennan's accuser, now in his 30s, was a former altar boy who cried on the stand weeks earlier as he described the incident. The man, a former Marine, was discharged because of mental health issues.
"He will say anything at all to get what he wants," Brennan's attorney, William Brennan, no relation to the defendant, told jurors about the accuser. "Plug that into your credibility meter."
Brennan was removed from active ministry in 2006 after his accuser first came forward. He admitted in 2008 that he allowed the then-14-year-old to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him during an overnight visit in 1996, according to testimony given to church investigators.
Brennan did not testify at the trial.
His attorney urged jurors to use their "common sense" once they began deliberations.
"It's a mistake; it's poor judgment," Brennan told jurors of the sleepover. "I can't believe a jury would destroy this man's life over that."
A 2011 grand jury report led the Philadelphia district attorney's office to criminally charge four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children.
The trial marks the first time U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed the abuses, but an official -- Lynn -- who stands accused of failing to stop the assaults.
A gag order bars all parties involved in the criminal case from talking to the media.

Apparently This Matters: The puppy room
By Jarrett Bellini, CNN
updated 10:00 AM EST, Tue January 1, 2013 | Filed under: Social Media
Stressed out at college? Puppies. Out of salsa? Puppies. See? All better.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Apparently This Matters" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at the social Web
This week, Jarrett breaks down a post on a university's "puppy room"
Puppies, when you think about it, are the answer to all of life's ills
Also, Reddit probably just thought of a new term for a sex act
Editor's note: Each week in "Apparently This Matters," CNN's Jarrett Bellini applies his warped sensibilities to trending topics in social media and random items of interest on the Internet.
(CNN) -- If you do a Google image search right now for "cute furry animals," you'll immediately find yourself in a fantastic world of kittens and hamsters and ducks and raccoons. And, oddly enough, if you scroll down a bit, there's even a bizarre Photoshopped image of Tom Hanks. It's his head on a bird's body.
The Internet. Just like Al Gore intended.
Of course, as expected, you'll also find more than enough puppies to choke a horse. (Though, that does seem a rather strange and unethical metaphor. But, nevertheless, if gagging a thoroughbred is at the top of your Outlook, I'd think just one medium-sized Frenchton would do the trick.)
The point here is that the Internet is filled with cute dogs. And people will usually click on just about anything that even mentions the word.
Stressed out? Go to the 'puppy room'
Which is why it completely makes sense that a random puppy-related news story from Canada happily turned more than a few heads this week, even here in the United States where, generally speaking, most Americans don't particularly care about whatever it is you crazy kids are doing up in the Great White North.
We assume it has something to do with beer and moose and Neil Young. And, mind you, that's nothing to be ashamed of. Well, depending on what's happening to the moose. Sinners.
But like many, I first read about this trending puppy story in the National Post, where Jen Gerson reported that Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia had set up a "puppy room" to help students relieve stress.
It's a simple and brilliant idea. But if you're having trouble picturing what this actually looks like, their advertising slogan for the three-day event pretty much lays it out:
Yup, it's a room full of puppies.
"Apparently This Matters" Is Jarrett Bellini's weekly (and somewhat random) look at social-media trends.
Michael Kean, a third-year environmental science student proposed the idea. He told the National Post, "It fills a niche that people need right now because students are super stressed."
And that's why they decided to work with a pet therapy organization called Therapeutic Paws of Canada. Though, I honestly wonder if the school had to specify just what kind of paws they actually wanted on campus.
These are some rather burly people up there above us. So, who knows what else Therapeutic Paws of Canada has in stock.
"We weren't sure what to bring, so here's six grizzlies and a wolf."
I believe six grizzlies and a wolf is technically known as a Manitoba Petting Zoo. And in an hour somebody on Reddit will turn it into a slang sex term. I hope.
But long before one of this week's planned stress-reducing events ever happened, students were already buzzing about the possibility of rolling around with little Labradoodles and Shelties and Goldens.
Gavin Jardine, vice-president of student life at Dalhousie's student union, told the National Post, "We haven't even printed posters. We just posted a pdf poster to our Facebook page and it took off. We had 1,800 shares, thousands of likes. It's gone viral on Twitter as well."
Behold! The power of dogs!
Some students actually waited for almost an hour just to get into the puppy room -- which does seem somewhat counterintuitive since highly stressed-out people waiting in long lines usually leads to violence. Maybe even puppy violence.
"Boy, that escalated quickly."
But never mind the queues. What's really amazing is that -- to my knowledge -- it actually took this long for somebody to come up with such a great idea in the first place. I mean, when I was in college we didn't have puppy rooms. We had a frozen yogurt machine.
Behold. The power of vanilla.
See? Doesn't have the same ring to it. And that's why puppies should be your go-to answer for all of life's problems.
"We're out of salsa." "Puppies."
"Dude, that doesn't even make sense."
Anyway, credit to Dalhousie University for providing a room full of dogs for everybody to enjoy. It was a really clever idea, with just the right amount of pointless absurdity. So, here's hoping you all mellowed out and did well on your exams.
And if not, screw it.
Puppies.

Golden Globes movie nominees: Who will win vs. who should
By Jennifer Vineyard, Special to CNN
updated 8:03 PM EST, Sun January 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Here are a few educated guesses on who will win at the Golden Globes
Globes distinguish between dramas and comedies/musicals in picture, top acting categories
"Lincoln" is favorite for drama; "Les Miserables" expected to win for musical/comedy
(CNN) -- Now that the Oscar nominations are in, it's time to think about what will happen at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
To make your Globes viewing (or betting?) more manageable, here are some of CNN's most educated guesses on who will win and who should win, with input from some of the nominees.
Nominees for the 70th annual Golden Globes
Best motion picture -- drama
The five contenders are "Argo," "Django Unchained," "Life of Pi," "Lincoln" and "Zero Dark Thirty."
"Lincoln" is the favorite. But the drama that should win is "Zero Dark Thirty," which had to be revised when real life intervened with the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.
History's never harder to write than when it hasn't been fully written yet -- or when it has only recently been declassified. "It's about the unsung heroes of the intelligence community," director Kathryn Bigelow said at the National Board of Review Awards this week. "This is about the people who work in the shadows, and will continue to work in the shadows."
Best motion picture -- comedy or musical The contenders are "Les Miserables," "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel," "Moonrise Kingdom," "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen" and "Silver Linings Playbook."
It's a little unfair that a great musical has to go up against a great dramedy. At least "Silver Linings Playbook" (which should win) will be trounced by "Les Miserables" (which will win) instead of "Lincoln," which likely will best both come Oscar time.

Golden Globes red carpet
Best director Oscar nominees Steven Spielberg ("Lincoln") and Ang Lee ("Life of Pi") are up against three directors the Academy Awards snubbed Thursday -- Bigelow ("Zero Dark Thirty"), Quentin Tarantino ("Django Unchained") and Ben Affleck ("Argo").
Spielberg likely will win -- although, really, it should be Bigelow. "I find her to be an incredibly modern storyteller who takes on weighty subjects and makes profound films," her leading lady, Jessica Chastain, said at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards this week. "Being on set with Kathryn is a master class."
Best screenplay The Globes distinguish between dramas and comedies/musicals in the best picture and leading acting categories, but not between original and adapted screenplay. It's a fierce competition and perhaps slightly unfair to those who didn't have a book, article or other movie as a springboard for their work.
The team of rivals here include Tony Kushner for "Lincoln" (based upon Doris Kearns Goodwin's book), David O. Russell for "Silver Linings Playbook" (based upon Matthew Quick's novel), Chris Terrio for "Argo" (based upon Joshuah Bearman's article in Wired), Tarantino for "Django Unchained" (inspired by the 1966 spaghetti Western "Django") and Mark Boal for "Zero Dark Thirty" (based upon his own reporting).
Kushner will win, but Boal should. "Mark Boal researched this film from the ground up, with a diligence and a meticulous fervor that certainly was inspiring on the page," Bigelow said.
Best performance by an actor -- drama
The leading men in the drama category are Daniel Day-Lewis ("Lincoln"), Denzel Washington ("Flight"), Joaquin Phoenix ("The Master") and two who were snubbed by Oscar -- Richard Gere ("Arbitrage") and John Hawkes ("The Sessions").
Day-Lewis is the clear favorite, and even money says the notoriously method actor will win. "On the last shot of the last day, minutes after the film was completely done, Daniel embraced me and spoke to me for the first time in four months with his English accent," Spielberg said. "That made me cry even harder."
But what about someone who has been less talked about winning, another method actor like Phoenix?
"He is a wonderful actor," said his "Master" co-star Amy Adams. "He was so invested and entrenched in being this unhinged person. His performance in this is beyond anything I've ever seen before."
Best performance by an actress -- drama
The competitors are Chastain ("Zero Dark Thirty"), Marion Cotillard ("Rust and Bone"), Helen Mirren ("Hitchcock"), Naomi Watts ("The Impossible") and Rachel Weisz ("The Deep Blue Sea").
Of these, only Chastain and Watts have Oscar nods, but Chastain has the edge. "Zero Dark Thirty" is a procedural, however, and despite Chastain being a great actress, it's not the best showcase of her work.
But Cotillard has never given a finer performance as a woman who loses her legs in a tragic accident. "It's really about her relationship to her body," Cotillard told CNN. "Before, she was empty, because she didn't enjoy her life. And after, she had to learn to live again. She has a fuller life without legs. It's an unconventional love story."
Best performance by an actor -- comedy or musical If only the great comedians didn't have to go up against the great musical performers, because there's only one leading man in this category who's both funny and sings: Jack Black for "Bernie."
Black's competition includes Hugh Jackman ("Les Miserables"), Bradley Cooper ("Silver Linings Playbook"), Ewan McGregor ("Salmon Fishing in the Yemen") and Bill Murray ("Hyde Park on Hudson").
Jackman will win for his portrayal of Jean Valjean, but the most truly insane performance of the year belongs to Cooper. DiCaprio called it "unbelievable." Josh Brolin called Cooper "amazing." We call him another should-be winner.
Best performance by an actress -- comedy or musical
Jennifer Lawrence, Cooper's "Silver Linings" co-star, has some stiff competition in this category -- Meryl Streep ("Hope Springs"), Maggie Smith ("Quartet"), Judi Dench ("The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel") and Emily Blunt ("Salmon Fishing in the Yemen").
Despite facing off against such heavyweights, Lawrence should win for her portrayal of a promiscuous widow with a depressive disorder who ropes Cooper into a dance competition. "When she came over the transom with her Skype audition, I was like, 'Oh my God, who is this?' " director David O. Russell said. "Even though I had seen her on the Oscar circuit (for 'Winter's Bone'), I never understood who she was, and she showed up on Skype dressed as the character and knocked me out. She's a weapon waiting to be fired."
Best performance by an actress in a supporting role
And here the separation between drama and comedy/musical ends -- too bad for anyone who isn't Anne Hathaway ("Les Miserables").
Hathaway's competitors include Amy Adams ("The Master"), Sally Field ("Lincoln"), Helen Hunt ("The Sessions") and Nicole Kidman ("The Paperboy"). Kidman is the only one here who didn't make it in the Oscar nominations -- Jacki Weaver ("Silver Linings Playbook") replaced her for the nod.
Only Field seems geared up to give Hathaway a run for her money. Her turn as Mary Lincoln was a tour de force.
Best performance by an actor in a supporting role
The supporting actor nominees are Alan Arkin ("Argo"), Tommy Lee Jones ("Lincoln"), Philip Seymour Hoffman ("The Master") and Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio (both for "Django Unchained"), with only the latter (and the youngest) not receiving an Oscar nod this year.
Jones is the clear favorite for his portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, with Hoffman not far behind as the charismatic leader of a cult. But Waltz's performance as a German bounty hunter in the Deep South had more meat to it.
Best animated feature film
There's no clear consensus in this category on which movie should win. "Brave," "Frankenweenie," "Hotel Transylvania," "Rise of the Guardians" and "Wreck-It Ralph" all have a good shot, even if "Brave" might the closest thing to a favorite.
But "Frankenweenie," Tim Burton's passion project that began as one of the director's first short films before becoming a full-length feature almost 30 years later, is the only one to have been part of a popular, if macabre, Museum of Modern Art exhibition.
Best foreign-language film
With the Oscar nominations, "Amour" broke out of the foreign-language category and infiltrated the best picture field, so it's a clear favorite here -- one that should win.
Although the film is an Austrian entry, thanks to director Michael Haneke, "Amour" is in French, and its lovely competitors include "A Royal Affair" (Denmark), "Kon-Tiki" (Norway), "The Intouchables" (France) and "Rust and Bone" (also France).
If there is an upset, expect it to be from one of the French rivals since all three deal with the bonds between disabled people and the caretakers who love them (in different ways ).
Best original score
John Williams ("Lincoln"), Dario Marianelli ("Anna Karenina"), Alexandre Desplat ("Argo"), Mychael Danna ("Life of Pi") and Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil (all for "Cloud Atlas") are the nominees.
Williams -- the most celebrated of the bunch -- will win for creating a score accurate to the musical sensibilities of the 19th century. But the "Cloud Atlas" trio had to create something described in David Mitchell's book as a piece for six instrumental voices, with each solo interrupted by its successor, only to be recontinued in order (just like the book and movie's plot).
Put another way, that's six separate plots in six separate genres, serving as the connective tissue of the larger story. It should win, hands down.
Best original song
Keith Urban and Monty Powell ("For You," from "Act of Valor"), Bon Jovi ("Not Running Anymore," from "Stand Up Guys"), Taylor Swift ("Safe & Sound," from "The Hunger Games") and Adele ("Skyfall," from "Skyfall") are up against the "Les Miserables" juggernaut, which has a new original song in "Suddenly."
The latter's director, Tom Hooper, said, "In the novel, there's an extraordinary description of what it's like for Jean Valjean to discover what it's like to love a child who is in his care, and I felt it was the one thing in the original musical that was slightly underplayed. I asked Claude-Michel Schonberg if they could write a song to show this evolution, and here it is."
"Suddenly" will win -- if "Skyfall" doesn't -- but wouldn't it be a thrill if Swift and "The Hunger Games" could be like Katniss Everdeen in the arena, and come out the surprise victor? May the odds be ever in their favor.

Mexican cult accused of forced labor
By Rafael Romo and Nick Parker, CNN
updated 11:27 PM EST, Fri February 1, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mexican authorities raid a cult operating in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico
The group is said to have been involved in kidnapping and forced labor
Three Mexican citizens are being held on suspicion of human trafficking
14 foreigners were detained, and some will be deported
(CNN) -- A cult operating in Mexico, along the U.S. border, is accused of kidnapping and forcing victims to work and have sex, the country's National Migration Institute said Wednesday.
Fourteen foreigners -- accused by victims' relatives of demanding "tithes" from local followers -- were detained, and at least some are in the process of being deported, said the federal attorney general's office, or PGR.
Three Mexican citizens are being held on suspicion of human trafficking, the PGR said.
Immigration authorities and police raided the Defenders of Christ group in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, the migration institute said Tuesday night. Nuevo Laredo is across the border from its sister city, Laredo, Texas.
Six of the detained foreigners were Spanish, two Brazilian, two Bolivian, two Venezuelan, one Argentinean and one Ecuadorean.
The Defenders of Christ are not officially registered as a religious organization under Mexican law.
Authorities released the name of only one of those involved with the group, Jose Arenas Losanger Segovia, a Venezuelan identified as the leader of the organization, which "was characterized by its recruiting of people at the national level."

A website for the cult identifies Losanger as an "apostle" of the reincarnation of Christ. The group believes that a man named Ignacio Gonzalez de Arriba is the reincarnation of Jesus.
CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office and the lawyers of those involved but has been unsuccessful in getting replies.
Myrna Garcia, coordinator for the Support Network for Victims of Cults, says her group first received complaints about Gonzalez in December 2011. In February 2012, the group filed a complaint with authorities about the Defenders of Christ.
Garcia called Gonzalez "very dangerous because he manipulates the minds of people to satisfy his whims."
The accusations that the cult victims network gathered paint a picture of a man who forced people into labor without pay or threatened to deny food.
"He was able to convince them that they had to behave in certain ways to satisfy his economic and sexual needs," Garcia said.
Women were made to have sex with the men in the group, and polygamy was promoted in the cult, Garcia said.
Women were beaten and forced to prostitute themselves, she said.
Many of the victims became suicidal and lost contact with their families and children, she said.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NASCAR racer Danica Patrick says "gender doesn't matter"
Patrick said she enjoys pressure-filled moments
Patrick is the first woman to win a pole in NASCAR's top division
Jeff Gordon will start on the outside of the front row
(CNN) -- She says she was brought up to be the fastest driver, not the fastest girl.
None of the boys were faster on Sunday.
Danica Patrick became the first woman to win the pole position for the Daytona 500, considered the Super Bowl of NASCAR, posting a lap of 196.434 mph.
She'll start next Sunday's "Great American Race" in the front row, on the inside part of the track. The polesitter begins the race with certain strategic advantages as well as the prestige of leading an elite pack.
What is poll position?
Becoming the first woman to win a pole at any NASCAR top-division race is another milestone for a racer known for breaking barriers.
"I've heard stories about a kid, a boy or a girl, saying, 'But mommy, daddy. That's a girl that's out there racing.' And then they can have that conversation to say, 'You can do anything you want to do and gender doesn't matter.' Your passion is what matters. And that's cool," Patrick told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday.
"When the pressure is on and when the spotlight is on, they ultimately become some of my better moments," she said earlier.

Patrick, who was the favorite to win the pole, said she felt some nerves because of the high expectations.
"I feel more nervous when there is more on the line," she said. "It was, 'Just don't make a stupid mistake.'"
She said that driving a qualifying lap at Daytona, where drivers shift gears three times then run the engine pretty much wide open, was 90% crew preparation and 10% driver.
Not so, said her crew chief, Tony Gibson, who said it's an even split.
"I'm proud of her. She didn't falter," he said.
She will start her No. 10 GODADDY Chevrolet in the front row next week alongside Jeff Gordon, who ran a lap at the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway at 196.292 mph in his No. 24 Drive to End Hunger Chevrolet.
"She runs so smooth, keeps such a smooth line and that's what you have to do to carry speed here," co-car owner and fellow driver Tony Stewart said.
A pole position does not guarantee success.
Only nine of the pole winners in the first 54 Daytona 500s won the race and no one has earned both victories since Dale Jarrett in 2000, NASCAR spokesman Scott Warfield said.
The rest of the field will be set in two qualifying races scheduled for Thursday.
Patrick and Gordon are guaranteed two of the 43 slots in the final lineup. But they go to the back of the pack if they wreck their cars in the qualifiers, or at any time before Sunday's race, and have to switch to a backup car, Warfield said.
Patrick, 30, is in her first full year as a NASCAR Sprint Cup driver. Last year she made 10 Sprint Cup starts, qualifying no better than 23rd.
NASCAR says Patrick still qualifies as a rookie for the 2013 season and she's the first rookie to win the Daytona 500 pole since Jimmie Johnson in 2002.
Before racing stock cars, Patrick raced open-wheel IndyCars for several years.
Patrick said winning a pole position in Kansas in 2005 was one of her top moments as an IndyCar driver. She also was the first woman to win a race in that series, in Japan in 2008, and was the first woman to ever lead a lap at the famed Indianapolis 500.
Patrick won a pole last year at Daytona in the Nationwide Series, NASCAR's second division. She finished 38th in that race and in the Daytona 500 and she said on Sunday that she plans on competing in both races again next weekend.
Janet Guthrie previously held both the records for qualifying by a female driver. She qualified ninth for two races in 1977 and her best Daytona starting position was 18th in 1980.
Gordon, a three-time champion at the Daytona 500, welcomed Patrick to the front row.
"This is great from the sport and the rest of us will benefit from it," he said. "I'm proud to sit on the front row with her."
She also said that the wait to see if she had won the pole was made more agonizing because she had gone to work out as other drivers went one by one, trying to best her top lap.
Patrick told CNN that understanding the scope of her achievement "is something that happens down the road. In the moment, it's about thinking about what I need to do for next Sunday and trying to make some more history."

Rolling Stone cover: Why we must look
By David Weinberger, Special to CNN
updated 8:15 PM EDT, Fri July 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Weinberger says he's not outraged about the Rolling Stone cover
He asks, why must we prove bombings upset us before we can discuss not minding cover?
He says cover assumes that we all agree bombings were an act of a monster
Weinberger: Cover confronts the mystery of someone like us who came to hate us
Editor's note: David Weinberger is a senior researcher at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet & Society and author of "Too Big to Know" (Basic Books).
(CNN) -- I know I'm supposed to be outraged by the Rolling Stone cover that depicts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as a dreamy young man, with its implicit resonances with the famous Jim Morrison photo. When taken with the words that overlay it, the photo presents a mystery that we need to explore. So, I am not outraged. In fact, I am discouraged by the outrage itself.
I feel obligated to begin by stating that I have no sympathy for a murderer of children, that I was horrified by such actions, and that I feel deeply for the Boston bombing's victims. I live in Boston and have written about the sense of solidarity Bostonians felt after the attack, and especially on the day we sat still so that suspects could be tracked and caught. I rooted for Tsarenaev's capture, and I hope the alleged killer spends a long time miserable in jail, after a fair trial, of course.
But the very fact that we have to gain entry to the conversation by stating our bona fides like this disturbs me. Culture is based on shared values and beliefs. Having to state that you're against the killing and maiming of families and the loved ones they were cheering on creates a rift where there isn't one, as if this value were not a settled part of what binds our culture. Could we even come up with a stance that more quickly and surely means that you're not a part of the lives we share together?
David Weinberger
The Rolling Stone cover correctly assumes that there is no such rift. It assumes that of course we all hate what the Tsarnaev and his older brother, the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of doing (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings). The words on that cover state what many of us — the "us" that covers our culture — believe: He was a bomber. There isn't even an "alleged" there, and the premise of the article stated on the cover also denies that qualifier: "How a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam and became a monster." In case you were unclear about where Rolling Stone stands on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the words "bomber" and "monster" should make it clear.
But you shouldn't be unclear. That's why we have a culture -- a shared set of values and beliefs.
The words are not causing the outrage that the photo has engendered. But when taken with the words, the angelic photo makes exactly the point that needs to be made and that our Culture of Outrage obscures.
When a terrorist was raised in a foreign land, and especially when to the mainstream the terrorist looks foreign and repellent — for example, the photo of an unkempt, grim Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that has become so iconic that it's even used at Wikipedia, a site that takes a "neutral point of view" as its mantra — we feel safe in simply assigning the person to a category. "He's a terrorist," we say, as if that were a biological species that completely explains the person. Such categories shut down thought. They block understanding. Terrorist? 'Nuf said.

But it's not enough. Understanding is important not only so that we can help prevent the sort of despicable Boston Marathon bombers and the KSMs of our fractured world, but also so we can see our human species — and thus ourselves — more clearly.
The cover photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev taken with the stark words overlaying it speak to the mystery that was laid bare when the brothers were first identified. The media turned to his friends, interviewing young men and women who were profoundly shocked that someone they knew as helpful, warm, and open to diversity could be accused of so deeply betraying their values. I felt like I knew many of those friends, for they were so like our children and the children they know.
That was the mystery that was presented to us when the Tsarnaevs were identified not only as murder suspects, but as a threat to the humane innocence that is the heart of American culture.
We need that mystery explored. To counter our natural desire to think that those who attack us so vilely must be totally unlike us, we need not only the words denouncing them, but images that reminds us that they weren't born as what they became. This juxtaposition makes the mystery manifest: Someone like us became someone who hates us.
We need to explore that mystery not so we can sympathize with a despicable accused murderer but so we understand better how he passed beyond sympathy. The cover of Rolling Stone -- words and picture -- puts that awful mystery right in front of us.
But we seem to prefer the security of outrage.

Photos: People we lost in 2014
For about 18 years, she sang, tap-danced and acted her way into the hearts of millions. Her corkscrew curls were popular with little girls from the 1930s through the 1970s.
Early years
Her star shone brightest as a toddler, and 20th Century Fox cranked out a series of feature films with the adorable, talented little girl. Her hits included "Little Miss Marker" (1934), "Curly Top" (1935) and "The Littlest Rebel" (1935).
At the box office, she beat out the great adult stars of her day, such as Clark Gable and Bing Crosby. Her popularity spawned a large array of merchandizing items, such as dolls, hats and dresses.
She was the top box-office star four years in a row, from 1935 to 1938. Her career was at its peak as the country was suffering the effects of the Great Depression, and her films offered uplifting moments.
But as she got older, the pace of movies slowed, and by 1939, her popularity was fading. She and 20th Century Fox terminated her contract early in 1940, just before she reached her teenage years.
Share your memories of Shirley Temple Black
U.S. diplomat
She retired from filmmaking at 22 and married Charles Black, changing her last name from Temple to Temple Black.
But she did not fade from the public eye.
She embarked on a new career as a foreign diplomat: She served in the U.S. delegation to the United Nations from 1969 to 1974 was U.S. ambassador to Ghana from 1974 to 1976, and U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1992.
Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who appointed her to the Czechoslovakia post, said Tuesday that he and his wife "mourn the loss of an American icon."
"She captured the affections of millions around the world by her endearing performances on the silver screen as a young girl, but I also admired Shirley for her selfless service to our country later in her life," Bush said in a statement released by his spokesman. "In both roles, she truly lifted people up and earned not only a place in our hearts -- but also our enduring respect.
"Barbara and I send our condolences to Shirley's family and countless fans around the world."
A statement from Temple Black's family members said they "salute her for a life of remarkable achievements as an actor, as a diplomat, and most importantly as our beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and adored wife of fifty-five years of the late and much missed Charles Alden Black."
Enduring icon
She remained a cultural icon for decades after stepping down from the silver screen.
In 1958, she made a comeback as an entertainer, this time on television, in an hourlong show, "Shirley Temple's Storybook."
She later received two lifetime achievement awards for her performing career.
In 1972, Temple Black successfully battled breast cancer.
Funeral arrangements are pending. A remembrance guest book will be set up online at shirleytemple.com.
