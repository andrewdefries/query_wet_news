SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A large cloud that appeared over North Korea in satellite images several days ago was not the result of a nuclear explosion, according to a U.S. official.South Korea's Yonhap news agency is reporting a huge explosion shook North Korea's northernmost province on Thursday producing a mushroom cloud over 4 kilometers (two miles) wide.The blast coincided with the anniversary of North Korea's founding on Sepember 9 when various military activities are staged.The U.S. official said the cloud could be the result of a forest fire.South Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-yong said the government was aware of the reports and is checking them."I have no information about the size of the damage of the explosion," he said on Sunday, according to Yonhap. Chung also said he believed there was no correlation between the explosion and reports of North Korea preparing for a possible nuclear test.The New York Times reported on Saturday that U.S. President George W. Bush and his top advisers recently received intelligence reports that could indicate North Korea is preparing its first nuclear test, citing senior officials with access to the intelligence.John Irvine, a reporter for Britain's ITN TV who is in Pyongyang, said there has been no official response from the North Korean government, although there is pressure to provide an explanation. "I'm touring outside Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, right now with the British Junior Foreign Minister Bill Rammell, who has just told me that he is demanding a response from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here in North Korea," Irvine reported Sunday. "[Rammell] does have a meeting with a senior foreign minister here tomorrow and Mr. Fammell anticipates some answers at least by then."Yonhap reported the explosion happened in Yanggang province along the Chinese border, the site of Yongjori Missile Base -- a large facility with an underground missile firing range.According to data gathered by Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Yongjori is a suspected site for North Korea's uranium enrichment program.According to its Web site, NTI is a private charity -- funded by CNN founder Ted Turner -- dedicated to lessen the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical and biological -- around the globe.-- CNN National Security Correspondent David Ensor and Correspondent Sohn Jie-Ae contributed to this reportStory Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Metro crash 'like we hit a concrete wall,' passenger saysStory Highlights Passengers describe violent D.C. train wreck, smoky aftermath Nursing assistant says she helped woman with severely injured legs Doors initially wouldn't open, causing panic, passenger says Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO PHOTOSMAP (CNN) -- People who were aboard the Washington subway trains that wrecked Monday described scenes of severely injured victims and of passengers trying to help one another. Firefighters pull a stretcher off a firetruck at the scene of Monday's D.C. Metro crash.more photos » "I was just playing on my cell phone, [and] there was an abrupt bang," David Holland, who was on the train that struck the train in front of it, told CNN affiliate WJLA. "It threw us up and then forward. "There was so much dust. I've never seen so much dust. People were just discombobulated, crying," he said. "I think I'm one of the lucky ones who actually made it out." Nine people were killed and dozens injured when one Metro train slammed into the rear of another just before 5 p.m. Monday. Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies are investigating how the crash occurred. A certified nursing assistant who was on one of the trains told CNN affiliate WUSA that she gave first aid to others, including a woman who appeared to be in her 20s. "She is very, very torn in her legs -- the muscles and everything are torn, ripped through. She had metal pieces in her face," said the nursing assistant, who gave only her first name, Jeanie.

Tom Baker, who also was aboard the trailing train, told WUSA that in the moments after the crash, "I saw the entire car basically crumpling up on top of the first train. And when the smoke cleared, the whole front of that car was actually either open or it was missing." "When we looked to the left, we saw the front car; it was straight up in the air. People were trapped in the train and [lying] on the ground," passenger Serena McBride told WJLA. "There was smoke and other chemical toxic smells coming out of the car in front," passenger Tracey Paddock told WUSA. "We tried to help break the door down to get those other people in, but we couldn't do it because of the structure of the car." See images of the scene » Jasmine Garsd, who also was on the moving train, said on CNN's "Larry King Live" that the crash "was like nothing I've ever felt before." "It was like we hit a concrete wall," said Garsd, who lives in Washington. She said the lights went off and smoke started filling the car. "Panic kind of ensued. I mean, the doors didn't automatically open. People started pounding against the doors. Eventually, somebody opened one of the doors, and there was a Metro employee who took us all off," she said. She and others around her, including a woman who Garsd said was seven or eight months pregnant, waited a while and then decided to walk back to the previous train station. Watch injured passengers limp away » "In the moment that this happened, it was like a deserted island. Nobody knew what was going on. It was silent," she said. "We walked for 20 minutes on the track, and there was a barbed wire fence, and you don't realize the distance that you cover" while riding the subway. See the location of the crash » Passenger Savannah Green was thankful that a change in her routine may have saved her. "I'm so happy that I was too lazy to walk to the front to get near the escalator, because I would have been on that front car," Green told WUSA.

Trial for U.S. hikers detained in Iran set for February From Reza Sayah, CNN The mothers of Shane Bauer, shown left, and Josh Fattal hold pictures of the two hikers being held in Iran. STORY HIGHLIGHTSAttorney: "My hands are tied"The court said the two did not show up at an earlier dateThe hikers have been held since 2009

Iran
(CNN) -- A trial for two American hikers held in Iran has been postponed until February 6, their attorney, Masoud Shafii, said Sunday. The reason for the delay was the absence of Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer at the initial trial date of November 6, Shafii said he was told. The court told him the two were summoned to court but did not show up, he said. Shafii said that makes no sense, because the two are in government custody, and it's the government's responsibility to bring them to court. "I am upset, but my hands are tied," he said. "I can't do anything. I've read their case file, and I found no reason for them to be charged with a crime, so even one more day in prison is not justified." Bauer and Fattal have been held in Evin Prison in the Iranian capital of Tehran for more than a year. They and a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, were arrested in 2009 after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Iran has accused them of espionage. Shourd was released on humanitarian grounds in September. State-run media reported days before November 6 that the trial date had been postponed as officials decided whether or not to summon Shourd. "The court schedule for the two Americans was set, but the judiciary itself faced a problem, which was whether or not to summon Sarah Shourd to appear in court," Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, spokesman for the judiciary and attorney general for Tehran, said at a news conference, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. "Apparently she had not been summoned to appear in court. Today I heard that the courts had decided that the third national who was freed and released earlier must also appear in court." In early November, Iran's mission to the United Nations said Bauer and Fattah's parents would be allowed to speak to their sons via telephone. The decision on the phone calls was made based on "humanitarian consideration" after meetings with U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-New York, and Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Khazaee, according to Mahdi Nourian, a spokesman for Iran's U.N. mission. It was not known Sunday whether the telephone contact has occurred.

Death toll rises to 9 in Nevada air race crash; close to 70 injured By the CNN Wire Staff Plane nosedived into spectatorsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Investigators identify and recover parts of the accident aircraft tail"The severity of this accident was the worst I've seen," an ER doctor saysInvestigators will look at how the plane's elevator trim tab broke off before crashThe pilot may have tried to avoid crowded grandstands before crashing Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- The number of people killed when a pilot lost control of his vintage plane and crashed into spectators during an air race over Reno, Nevada, rose to nine Saturday. Seven people died on the tarmac, including the pilot, and two more died in hospitals, Reno police said. Officials had previously put the death toll at three. Close to 70 people were injured in the incident, which occurred Friday. National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind said investigators are looking at whether the plane's apparently damaged elevator trim tab -- whose breaking apart was captured in a photograph -- played a role in the nosedive crash. Authorities do not know why the aircraft went down. "We're aware of that, and in fact, a component has been recovered in the area where it was observed, but it's critical at this point to note that we have not identified this component," Rosekind told reporters. "It will be examined, so we don't know what the component is and whether it came from this particular aircraft." He said later that investigators had identified and recovered portions of the accident aircraft tail. 9 fatalities from air race accident

A full investigation could take six to nine months, Rosekind said. Investigators will be poring over a trove of spectators' videos and photos, he said. "It seems there were a tremendous number of cameras and video that was captured," he said. "On the one hand, it's an excellent source of information, but on the other hand, there's not a lot of other specific components from the wreckage that at this point we can identify." At the time of the crash, three NTSB investigators happened to be at the air show -- a common practice -- and one of them has been appointed investigator in charge, Rosekind said. The board will look at safety oversight and the placement of the grandstands for the air race, Rosekind said. Investigators are also looking into whether the plane had a black box, Rosekind said, though at this point, he does not believe it had a recording device. Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told reporters that the air race spectator fatalities were the first in four decades. The Reno Air Race Association was founded in 1964, according to its Facebook page. "This is the first time in 40 years, I think, that we've had a visitor injured or killed," Cashell said Saturday. "We've lost some pilots, but we've never had a major catastrophe." When asked if the high-speed air race was held too close to public viewers, Cashell responded: "I'm not an expert on that. It's going to be up to the airport authority and it's going to be up to the air race board, and it's going to be up to these guys," referring to the NTSB investigators. "We would like to see if we can keep it open," the mayor said about the air race and its future. One local hospital, Renown Medical Center, received 34 patients, six of whom were in critical condition as of Saturday evening, a spokeswoman said. Two of the six critical patients suffered major head injuries and their prognosis is "guarded," according to Dr. Myron Gomez, chief of trauma services. Two patients -- a male and a female -- died, the hospital said Friday. Dr. Mike Morkin, the medical director of emergency services at the hospital, was on duty when the call about the crash came in Friday. "The severity of this accident was the worst I've seen since I've been at Renown," Morkin, a 16-year veteran at the hospital, said, adding "it was traumatic." Renown South Meadows Medical Center received and discharged five patients, the hospital said Saturday. St. Mary's Hospital in Reno said it had accepted 28 patients from the accident: two were in critical condition, seven in serious condition, and five in fair condition as of Saturday afternoon. Fourteen other patients were treated and released Friday. The pilot, identified as Jimmy Leeward, a real estate developer from Ocala, Florida, was killed in the crash, according to a show official. The 74-year-old was flying a P-51 Mustang. Saturday races were canceled in the wake of the crash, the show said. A memorial service scheduled for the pilot in Reno was also canceled because his family left the area, said Valerie Miller, a race spokeswoman. A day before the crash, in an interview from Airshow TV, Leeward expressed confidence about his prospects in the race -- while hinting that his team would fly even faster in the days to come. "We're as fast as anybody in the field, and maybe even faster," he said. "We've been playing poker since last Monday, so we're ready to show a couple more cards (so) we'll see what happens." Several witnesses were calling the pilot a hero because he maneuvered the plane away from the crowded grandstands at the last moment. Ben Cissell said the plane crashed about 100 feet from where he was seated. "I think that pilot in the last seconds pulled up because he saw the bleachers and saved about 200 or 300 others," Cissell said. Kim Fonda said she also saw the plane streaking toward where she was seated in the grandstand. "I closed my eyes and said, 'I am going to die now,' " Fonda said. "I was literally preparing to die and then he jerked the plane away and it landed like 25 feet from us. I want his family to know he was a hero." Video of the crash, posted on YouTube, showed a plane plummeting from the sky, sending up clouds of dust and debris. Shocked spectators rose to their feet. Another witness, Greg Mills, said the pilot "didn't have enough altitude to pull up," with the aircraft shuddering before slamming to the ground about 50 to 75 yards from where he was standing. The plane, called the "Galloping Ghost," was taking part in a qualifying round in the "unlimited class" division of the air race when it went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday, said Mike Draper, the show spokesman. The final rounds had been slated for the weekend.CNN's Michael Martinez, Mike Ahlers, Kelly Marshall Smoot, Greg Morrison and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.

JetBlue pilot charged with interfering with flight crew
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:01 PM EDT, Wed March 28, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "Pretty much, their career is done," psychiatrist says about psychotic episodes among pilots "Initially, he did not exhibit any bizarre behavior," FBI agent's affidavit says
Clayton Osbon talked about his church and needing to "focus," affidavit says
If convicted, pilot faces a maximum 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine
(CNN) -- A JetBlue pilot has been charged with interfering with a flight crew after his midair behavioral meltdown led to an emergency landing.
The federal criminal complaint reveals details of the incident in which Clayton Osbon, 49, displayed what passengers and fellow crew members described as erratic, bizarre and disturbing behavior.
Osbon has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment, the airline said Wednesday.
If convicted, Osbon would face a maximum 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The U.S. Attorney's office has 30 days to present the matter to a grand jury for indictment.
Read the criminal complaint
In the two-page affidavit in support of an arrest warrant, FBI Special Agent John Whitworth said Osbon missed the crew briefing for Flight 191, which departed at 7:28 a.m. Tuesday from New York's Kennedy International Airport en route to Las Vegas.

Witness: Fliers 'wrestle' JetBlue pilot
"Initially, he did not exhibit any bizarre behavior," Whitworth said in the affidavit, which describes behavior that grew more erratic as the flight continued.
The affidavit details the trip:
As the plane was taking off, Osbon "said something to the FO (first officer) about being evaluated by someone," but the first officer was not sure what Osbon meant.
Osbon talked about his church and needing to "focus," then asked the first officer to take over the controls and the radio. Osbon said, "Things just don't matter," talked about sins in Las Vegas, and at one point said, "We're not going to Vegas."
About 3½ hours into the planned five-hour flight, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew. He then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom.
By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside.
From the cabin, Osbon tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit "and he banged on the door hard enough that the FO thought he was coming through the door."
But the door held and, over the PA, the first officer ordered passengers to restrain Osbon. Several did just that, subduing the pilot in the forward galley. During the melee, a flight attendant suffered bruised ribs.
A passenger said Osbon said, "Pray f***ing now for Jesus Christ" and mumbled about Jesus, September 11, Iraq, Iran and terrorists.
How are flight crews screened?
"The pilot ran to the cockpit door, began banging on it and said something to the effect of, 'We've gotta pull the throttle back. We've gotta get this plane down,'" said passenger Laurie Dhue, a former CNN anchor.
"At that point, the two flight attendants tried to subdue him, and then -- seemingly out of nowhere -- about six or seven large guys stormed to the front of the plane and wrestled the captain of the plane down to the ground and had him subdued in a matter of moments," she said. "It was really like something out of a movie."
Amateur video of the incident showed a commotion as men moved through the aisle. A voice, purportedly that of the pilot, can be heard.
"Oh my God. I'm so distraught!" he shouts. "We've got Israel, we've got Iraq, we've got Israel, we've got Iraq! We've got to get down!"
Law enforcement met the aircraft, cuffed the pilot and took him off the plane.
If that description of Osbon's behavior is correct, "this guy was clearly psychotic," said Dr. William Sledge, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine who has not treated Osbon. "That has all the earmarks of an acute psychotic episode. I wouldn't hesitate to make that statement."
Psychosis is an automatic disqualification from flying, said Sledge, who is himself a pilot, was a flight surgeon at the School of Aerospace Medicine and has consulted for the Federal Aviation Administration, the Airline Pilots Association and a number of airlines.
Cases of psychosis among pilots are unusual, but not rare, and can be career-ending, he said.
"Pretty much, their career is done, most of them," he said. "It's a lifetime disqualification for obvious reasons ... you have to be able to trust each other and you have to be able to trust that the airman is going to be able to perform in a reasonable way."
Passenger Tony Antolino praised the co-pilot. "He really, I think, is the hero here because he had the sense to recognize that something was going horribly wrong, and he was able to persuade the pilot out of the cockpit," he said.
The first officer declared an emergency and the plane landed at about 11 a.m. in Amarillo, Texas. Passengers restraining Osbon continued to do so during the landing.
Osbon, who has worked as a JetBlue pilot for 12 years, has been taken off active duty with pay, said airline spokeswoman Tamara Young.
CEO Dave Barger said Osbon had always been a "consummate professional."
"What happened at altitude is we had a medical situation," Barger told NBC News. "It became a security situation."
Barger said the captain was in custody of the FBI. Citing privacy concerns, JetBlue would not divulge details about his treatment.
Osbon has not made a public statement.
The Twitter page for a Clayton F. Osbon describes him as "JetBlue Flight Standards Captain" for the Airbus A320, as well as a leadership coach. Tuesday's Flight 191 from New York to Las Vegas was on an Airbus A320.
Both the Twitter and LinkedIn pages in Osbon's name describe him as a director of Body By Vi. The LinkedIn page says the company helps "people to a better life" through health and financial prosperity.
A Facebook page for a Clayton Osbon says he is married and lives in Savannah, Georgia.
The blog Writer Killing Darlings carries a profile of Osbon, which was published last year in the magazine Richmond Hill Reflections. "Clayton lives with his wife of six years, Connye, and enough animals to make a lint-brush essential," the story says.
Osbon "wants to be a motivational speaker down the road," the story says.
"It starts with a greater enhanced knowledge of one's being... you know, I'd like to think the world is more than just getting up in the morning, making a cup of coffee, going to work, coming home, kissing your wife good-night and going to bed," it quotes him as saying.
"I was surprised, to say the least," Christine Lucas, who wrote the profile, said about her reaction when she heard the news Tuesday. She said she had met with the pilot three times in preparing to write the story and that he gave no indication that anything was amiss. "He was fantastic, and I believe he probably still is. I'm as eager as everybody else to figure out what happened. But he was a gregarious guy, he was confident and he seemed happy. I can't say that anything led me to think that something like this would happen."
CNN's Tom Watkins, Josh Levs, Mike Ahlers, Aaron Cooper, Susan Candiotti, Jim Barnett and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.

Battling cancer, Chavez suffers more complications
By Dana Ford, CNN
updated 6:59 PM EST, Tue January 1, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has not been seen or heard from in weeks
He is recovering from cancer surgery earlier this month in Cuba
Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro says Chavez's health remains "delicate" (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who is recovering from cancer surgery, has suffered "new complications," Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday.
"President Chavez's state of health continues to be delicate, with complications that are being treated in a process that is not without risks," he said.
Maduro spoke in Havana, Cuba, where Chavez is undergoing treatment. He said he met with Chavez, who has not been seen in public or heard from for weeks.

Hugo Chavez's health mystery Venezuelan leader's long cancer fight
The Venezuelan president first announced he was battling cancer in June 2011.
Chavez, 58, has not disclosed what type of cancer he has, and the Venezuelan government has released few details about his illness, fueling widespread speculation about his health and political future.

Last year, Chavez had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor and has undergone further surgery and radiation in Cuba since. He returned to the island nation this month to undergo another surgery after publicly revealing that his cancer had returned.
He underwent a six-hour surgical procedure on December 11 that Maduro, in a televised address, declared a success.
A week after the president's surgery, the Venezuelan information minster said Chavez was battling a respiratory infection. Minister Ernesto Villegas said then that the infection was under control.

Compromise sets up likely Senate debate on gun laws
By Dana Bash and Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 11:01 AM EDT, Thu April 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Newtown family members praise emotional Sen. Manchin for his courage
Two senators reach a deal to expand background checks to gun shows, Internet
President Obama would prefer stronger proposal, but says it is welcome progress
Democrats believe they have enough votes to overcome a GOP filibuster
Washington (CNN) -- In a breakthrough on gun legislation, two U.S. senators -- a Democrat and a Republican -- announced Wednesday they had worked out a compromise on expanding background checks on firearms buyers to include gun shows and Internet sales.
The deal reached by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, sets up the likelihood of a major Senate debate on gun legislation starting as soon as Thursday, when the chamber is expected to overcome a GOP filibuster attempt to block the proposals.
President Barack Obama and leading Democrats have pushed for tighter gun laws in the aftermath of the December school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 first-graders and six educators.
In an emotional scene later on Wednesday, Manchin choked up while meeting with relatives of Newtown victims who praised him for his political courage in taking on the powerful gun lobby.

"You give me more legislative strength than you know," Manchin said at one point.
He then was unable to speak when asked by a reporter how the Newtown families affected his role in the negotiations with Toomey and others.
Despite the agreement reached by Manchin and Toomey, both rated as strong supporters of gun rights by the influential National Rifle Association, the prospects for significant gun legislation to win congressional approval remained uncertain.
The NRA responded to the Manchin-Toomey agreement by saying it would fail to address the core issues of gun violence.
"Expanding background checks at gun shows will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools," it said in a statement.
Following the Newtown shootings by a lone gunman, Obama called for a series of proposals including "universal" background checks on all gun purchases. Currently, the federal law requiring background checks covers licensed firearms dealers, with private sales excluded.
Fierce opposition by the NRA and its allies in Congress -- mostly conservative Republicans but also some Democrats from gun-friendly states -- made clear that the universal checks sought by Obama had no chance of passing, leading to efforts by Manchin, Toomey and others to work out a compromise.
Gun rights activist dismisses polls
"The bottom line for me is this: If expanding background checks to include gun shows and Internet sales can reduce the likelihood of criminals and mentally ill people from getting guns and we can do it in a fashion that does not infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, then we should do it, and in this amendment I think we do," Toomey told reporters on Wednesday.
Asked later about criticism by the NRA and others, he told CNN that the proposed legislation was "not a cure-all, but I think it would be some progress."
Manchin noted that the proposal meant that firearms buyers at gun shows would face the same background check currently required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers. In addition, it would close a loophole that exempts intrastate gun sales on the Internet from requiring a background check, he said.
Addressing concerns of the NRA that expanding background checks would burden law-abiding gun owners seeking to trade or gift weapons in a personal transfer, Manchin declared that "personal transfers are not touched whatsoever."
Opinion: A background check even the NRA could love?
Another provision would recognize the legitimacy of concealed weapons permits across state lines.
The Manchin-Toomey compromise also would require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the "violently mentally ill" to the national background check system, addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information.
In addition, the plan calls for a new National Commission on Mass Violence to report in six months on "all aspects of the problem, including guns, school safety, mental health, and violent media or video games."
The NRA said rejection of the universal checks sought by Obama was "a positive development," and it called for "serious and meaningful solutions" to gun violence instead of "blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers."
Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks
Obama said there are aspects of the proposal that he would like to see strengthened.
"But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress. It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don't have to agree on everything to know that we've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence," he said.
"Congress needs to finish the job," Obama added, saying he would continue "asking the American people to stand up and raise their voices because these measures deserve a vote."
Other reaction ranged from cautious support to angry rejection.
The Brady Campaign, named after the former White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, called the compromise a "good step forward," while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as "better than nothing" but a sellout to the gun lobby.
"This is a Congress that is captive of the extremists and there is no clearer proof of that than this," Cuomo said on the "Capitol Pressroom" radio show, adding that the compromise meant "we are not talking about a significant package of gun control anymore."
Why we're still debating guns
Manchin told reporters the compromise on background checks would be the first amendment offered when the Senate begins debating the package of gun legislation.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday he would hold a vote on opening debate on the gun package Thursday, putting pressure on Manchin and Toomey to finalize their agreement intended to overcome a Republican filibuster of the legislation.
The filibuster pledged by 14 GOP senators means Reid, whose Democratic caucus holds 55 seats, needs 60 votes to open debate on the gun legislation.
Democrats believe that as many as a dozen GOP senators will vote with them, making up for the handful of pro-gun Democrats who might vote against launching debate on the bill.
Should anyone be able to buy guns? Share your views
Obama has made gun measures a major focus of his second-term agenda, holding events across the country to push for Congress to vote on the package.
He spoke Monday in Connecticut, where the Newtown shootings occurred, and Vice President Joe Biden made a similar call for action at the White House on Tuesday.
A successful GOP filibuster would prevent a vote on specific components of the legislative package. Even if an amended bill passes the Senate, approval from the Republican-led House remains uncertain.
Opinion: Why the NRA fights background checks
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was noncommittal on Wednesday on prospects for gun legislation, telling reporters he would wait to see what the Senate passes.
Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California and Republican Rep. Peter King of New York said they planned to introduce legislation in the House similar to the Senate compromise by Manchin and Toomey.
Obama's rhetoric has reflected the political uncertainty, with the president and his aides using increasingly personal language intended to shame Republicans into allowing public votes on measures that have public support but are fiercely opposed by the NRA.
On the other side, the NRA and its supporters in Congress say the Democratic proposals threaten the constitutional right to bear arms, and also offer ineffective responses intended as political show instead of real solutions to the problem of gun violence in America.
"On firearms questions, on Second Amendment questions, there's a divide in this country," NRA President David Keene told CNN. "To call it an ideological divide is too simple because it's a cultural divide. When something happens, the folks on the other side from us say, 'well the problem's the gun, we need to do something about guns.' "
Failing to pass new gun laws would be a stinging defeat for Obama and Democrats.
However, a public perception that Republicans blocked popular proposals, such as expanding background checks, could harm GOP prospects in 2014 and 2016 among moderates they need in their corner to have any chance of countering strong support for Democrats by minority demographics such as Hispanic Americans, African Americans and the gay-lesbian vote.
A new national survey showed that 86% of Americans support some expansion of background checks.
Hope grows for compromise proposal on gun control
At the same time, the CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday also showed a majority of respondents fear that increased background checks would lead to a federal registry of gun owners that could allow the government to take away legally owned weapons.
Keene and other opponents worry that an expanded background check system would create a paper trail that could eventually be used to build a national gun registry, which they reject as unconstitutional.
They also contend it would prove a burden to law-abiding gun owners while doing nothing to stop criminals from getting hold of firearms.
"The one thing you know today is that if the government creates a record, it's not secure," Keene said, adding that requiring background checks on all gun sales -- the so-called universal system -- raised the question of "is it linked to a national registration scheme."
According to a summary of the compromise proposal, it includes language that prohibits creation of a national gun registry or misusing information from background checks.
The high political stakes of the divisive gun law debate have bred hardball tactics and strategies.
The NRA has long kept a comprehensive scorecard of the voting records of legislators on gun issues, which it combines with campaign contributions to try to influence elections.
Background checks on gun sales: How do they work?
In response, a group led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Mayors Against Illegal Guns announced this week it was launching its own scorecard to identify members of Congress who vote against tougher gun laws.
The Senate Judiciary Committee passed a package of gun laws proposed by Obama after the Newtown attack by a lone gunman.
Proposals in the committee's package included expanding background checks on gun buyers, toughening laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, banning semiautomatic rifles modeled after military assault weapons as well as large-capacity ammunition magazines, and coming up with ideas for improving school safety.
The weapons ban, which would update a similar 1994 law that expired a decade later, already has been dropped, though Reid has promised a floor vote on it as an amendment to the package.
Some states already have passed stricter gun laws similar to the federal proposals since the Newtown shootings. They include Connecticut, where the killings occurred, and Colorado, the site of two other notorious mass shootings that contributed to a renewed gun debate in America.
The current background check system was created in 1989. It requires federally approved gun dealers to check whether gun buyers have a criminal background or other problem to make them ineligible to purchase a firearm.
Under the system, the gun dealer maintains a record of the transaction, but the federal government keeps no such identifying paperwork.
According to a Justice Department report, less than 2% of those seeking to purchase firearms were denied because of background checks from 1998 through 2009.
Opponents cite that figure as evidence that the system fails to stop illegal weapons sales that the legislation seeks to target, while supporters say the result shows the system keeps some guns out of the hands of the wrong people and the system should be expanded and strengthened.

School bullying's chilling new front
By Francey Hakes, Special to CNN
updated 11:28 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Francey Hakes: Several recent suicides of young people appear to be linked to bullying
Why does bullying seem more common, virulent, damaging today? The Internet, she says
She says kids are desperate, hopeless when their torment is widespread in tweets, "likes"
Hakes: Schools must do better; parents must police kids online lives for signs they are bullies
Editor's note: Francey Hakes served from 2002 to 2012 as a federal prosecutor and from 2010 to 2012 as the first National Coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction at the US Justice Department. She is CEO of Francey Hakes Consulting, which provides advice on child protection and national security. She blogs at FranceyHakes.
(CNN) -- Can cruel words really kill?
The answer, unfortunately, is yes. Recently, a teenage boy killed himself in Connecticut. Bart Palosz was just 15 when he took his family's shotgun and decided, apparently, that he had no other option but suicide. Last year, 12-year-old Joel Morales of New York hanged himself in his family's home. Earlier this year, 17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons of Nova Scotia, Canada, died from self-inflicted hanging injuries.
What did these two boys and one girl have in common?
They appear to have been bullied to death, friends and family members have said. For Bart, it was his size and Polish accent that the bullies repeatedly targeted. With Joel, bullies targeted him because of his small stature and stuttering. Joel's mother said she reported this to the school, but the bullying merely escalated.
Francey Hakes
Rehtaeh was the target of a bullying campaign after she made allegations that four teens sexually assaulted her. After the alleged assault, during which at least one photo was taken, someone distributed the photo, an illegal act, and still police indicated at the time that they would charge no one.
Rehtaeh's mother said her daughter suffered more than a year of harassment where her tormentors used the photo to ruin her reputation and break her spirit. We learned only last month, far too late to help Rehtaeh, that officials have finally charged two people in connection with the distribution of the photo.
Many schools say they have zero tolerance to bullying policies in place. In fact, officials at Cowetta Intermediate High School in Oklahoma say they have just such a policy. Authorities are still investigating whether 15-year-old Triston Stephens, who shot and killed himself in that school's bathroom on a Monday morning earlier this year, was a target of bullying. Some parents in the district said school officials ignored bullying that was taking place there.
Why do these problems seem more frequent and the bullying more vicious than ever before? After all, bullying existed long before cyberspace, social networking and text messaging. What has changed?
Are bullies meaner? Are there more of them? Why do children who are bullied today experience overwhelming feelings of isolation and despair, such that they feel compelled to end their young lives rather than endure any more torment?
The answer is simple. Now one person or a small group of bullies can exponentially raise the torment to an unimaginable level in cyberspace. One nasty comment can be "liked" on Facebook, retweeted or forwarded dozens or hundreds of times in an instant, making it seem to the bullied child that the whole world is out to get her.

What can be done about cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying prompts teen's suicide
Teens naturally feel a need to belong, to fit in. When they are bullied, especially by those using technology as a weapon, it may seem that they are all alone and that everyone they know is participating in the hate. The bullying is also much harder to escape, no longer limited to occasions when bully and victim are in the same place.
It can go on anywhere and anytime with the victim not only receiving bullying texts or tweets or posts, but also knowing that the bully is gratified when others read, view, or repost the nasty comments or photos.
Teens can fear repercussions if they disclose this abuse. And, yes, let's call it abuse since that is what goes on in a bullying case. They may feel they will never escape the reputation the bully has built for them and then see no alternative to suicide. Tragedy flows from such desperation.
Is there a solution?
Clearly, zero tolerance policies don't always work. There are definitive steps schools and parents should take. It's not enough for schools to declare zero tolerance, they must also engage their students in wide-ranging discussions on bullying and its impact on the victims.
Some schools have student-lead councils where rules are established and bullying accusations are adjudicated by the students themselves. Peer pressure works both ways, after all. Schools must establish clear rules and enforce severe consequences for students who bully at school, whether it is in person or via electronic devices issued by or used on school property.
Schools should also monitor cyberbehavior by students. There are good software tools that monitor cyberactivity in real time and flag threats based on keyword libraries that are specific to threatening, bullying, suicidal or violent language. Every school should have this kind of sophisticated monitoring to capture such behavior.
Parents should be equally responsible. Parents are often told to monitor their children's cyberbehavior to protect them from being groomed by predators or from sending illicit images of themselves. But parents should also monitor their children to see if they are doing the bullying.
They should talk broadly about cybersafety with their children.
They should talk to their children about the effect of one post or one photo on their futures. They should regularly monitor their child's technology, whether on social networking sites or on devices themselves.
It is time to reframe the debate over bullying.
It is not just "mean girls" or "boys being boys." It is the aggressive emotional abuse of a child, and we must all stand against it. Lives depend on it.

A global challenge: aiding those with disabilities
By Tara Sonenshine, Special to CNN
updated 7:45 AM EDT, Mon October 21, 2013
Disabled residents wait for help after being rescued from their nursing home during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Tara Sonenshine: In disasters, the needs of those with disabilities should be in forefront
She says Hurricane Katrina, Japan and Haiti earthquakes demonstrate the problem
U.N. report says needs of a billion people are not being woven into disaster planning
Editor's note: Tara Sonenshine is former undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs and currently a distinguished fellow at George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs.
(CNN) -- Imagine not being able to hear a siren during an emergency or to see a warning sign to evacuate. Imagine navigating knee-high mud in a wheelchair or trying to explain to a child with Down syndrome why he or she must seek higher ground. Those are just some of the challenges facing those with physical and cognitive disabilities -- people often least prepared to face a natural disaster.
A largely overlooked report issued this month by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction found that the crucial needs of about 1 billion people living with physical and mental disabilities around the world are not woven into the disaster planning and emergency response plans of governments and civil society groups.
The result is that a disproportionate number of disabled persons suffer and die in disasters because of a lack of attention to their needs. Emergency response systems and shelters are poorly designed to handle their requirements. According to the report, 70% of those with disabilities who responded to the survey in over 100 countries said they did not know how to tap into any existing emergency response system in their communities. They become largely dependent on the good will of families and neighbors.

The report confirms the experience from recent catastrophes like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti -- where deaf victims were trapped underneath rubble, unable to hear the sounds of rescuers drilling above -- and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, where victims in wheelchairs could not board evacuation buses or get into temporary housing that had no ramps.
And we have seen in the U.S. during Hurricane Katrina and other major storms how those with disabilities suffer. In a post-Katrina study of survivors, reports found that people with physical or cognitive disabilities faced considerable barriers to transportation, evacuation, and housing. Dozens died in nursing homes and medical centers. Many of the disabled survivors did not have jobs, making post-crisis transition even more challenging.
It is tempting to presume that people with disabilities are small in number. The reality, however, is that roughly 15% of people in the world live with a physical or cognitive disability -- many of them in developing countries that cannot afford care and inclusion.
In the United States, 37.2 million Americans have some form of disability. Despite the success of programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are millions of people left without meaningful employment, education, and services before, during, and after a crisis.
The United States has a global imperative to address the needs of the disabled today -- especially in difficult fiscal times. Leaving aside the moral obligation, there is an economic driver at work. Worldwide, people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates than those without disabilities. In developing countries, 80% to 90% of persons of working age with disabilities are unemployed, whereas in industrialized countries the figure is between 50% and 70%. Their exclusion from the workplace deprives societies of an estimated $1.4 trillion in gross domestic product.
As we plan for disaster relief, as well as routine development and assistance, it is vital that America lead with a sustained commitment to those with disabilities. The U.S. failure to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities -- a convention signed by 155 nations -- reinforces a perception that America does not care about the disabled.
Yet despite the failure to ratify the convention, America has a good story to tell on inclusive development and disabilities. The U.S. Agency for International Development has led the way on supporting principles of universal design that not only fund specific programs to address the targeted needs of disabled citizens, but integrate disabilities into generalized programs that improve job training, education, quality and accessibility of care.
Over 75% of U.S. missions and USAID offices report activities and programs that specifically include people with disabilities. The U.S. State Department has a special adviser for international disability rights and has made enormous progress in expanding the range of U.S.-funded exchange programs to include more participants with disabilities and to convene international experts around the issue.
Recently, a major conference took place in Washington, with leaders on disability rights from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tajikistan, and Uganda and representatives from NGOs, universities, and government offices in the U.S., to address challenges facing persons with disabilities in their home communities. The U.S. sent the first-ever official team of disabled sports envoys to China to promote inclusion and equality for persons with disabilities.
This month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of National Disability Employment Awareness Month to pay homage to our own citizens with disabilities. The October campaign theme is "Because we are EQUAL to the task." This is a good time to think about those at home and overseas who are marginalized and excluded because of disabilities and make sure we are doing our part.

10 things Taiwan does better than anywhere else
By Tina Hsiao, for CNN
updated 2:44 PM EST, Fri January 17, 2014
Craving oyster omelets and bubble tea in the middle of the night? Crowded with street hawkers, the 300 or so bustling bazaars on this tiny island operate until the small hours.
The island is home to a treasure of quirky restaurant concepts: hot pink Barbie, Hello Kitty and toilet restaurants where guests eat out of miniature urinals, to name a few.
Taiwan has a free, nationwide WiFi network. It was one of the first places in the world to offer free WiFi on a mass scale. With a permanent collection of more than 650,000 items, Taipei's National Palace Museum has the largest collection of Chinese artifacts and artwork in the world.
Two members of NMA Taiwan's 400-person animation team act out scenes that will appear in one of their popular CGI videos. NWA's talents were exposed to the world with the 2009 release of their hilarious video of what might have happened during Tiger Woods' infamous car crash. They might look and taste like fish balls, but these fried goodies are actually animal-free. Given how important flesh is to the traditional Chinese diet, it's little surprise that Taiwan is a leader in mock meat dishes that could fool even the most hardcore carnivore. Since the first Little League World Series in 1947, Taiwan has won more championships (17) than any country, nearly double that of runner-up Japan. In this snap, young Chien-Lung Lan of the Chinese Taipei Little League slides into home base. Taiwanese citizens can visit any doctor in the country. Fees are reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Administration, whose 2% administrative costs are the lowest in the world. Not only does the island have a Hello Kitty cafe, but Kitty-themed beer, airplanes and hotel rooms.
Taiwan's national food, "xiaolongbao" (broth-filled, bite-sized steamed dumplings), have earned Michelin stars and been listed in the Miele Guide.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
About 70% of Taiwan tourists will visit a night market
Taipei houses a collection of 650,000 Chinese artifacts and art -- largest in the world
Taiwan has won the most Little League World Series championships
(CNN) -- Editor's note: This story is part of a series highlighting superlatives of countries around the world. Click here for pieces on Italy, the United States, Canada and South Korea, and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries. With 23 million people crammed onto an island that covers just more than 36,000 square kilometers, Taiwan ranks among the 20 most densely populated places in the world.
Although the industrious island has built a global reputation for cheap electronics, this is one Asian tiger that offers far more than stickers on the backs of calculators.
Economically there's little it has left to prove, but Taiwanese people remain a proud and determined bunch.
Here are 10 things they do better than anyone else.
1. Night markets
Taiwan's 300-plus night markets await your midnight cravings.
For an island smaller in area than Switzerland, Taiwan sure has a lot of night markets -- an estimated 300 island-wide.
These open-air bazaars are particularly loved for street food, referred to locally as xiao-chi, literally "small eats."
Perennial favorites are oyster omelets, stinky tofu and an assortment of snacks on a stick straight off the grill.
Specialty drinks range from bubble tea to shots of snake blood.
According to the Taiwan Tourism Bureau, some 70% of tourists to Taiwan will visit a night market.
The top three Facebook check-ins for 2013 in Taiwan were all night markets; Tainan Flower Night Market (12th globally) nabbed the top spot, followed by Luodong and Feng Chia night markets in Yilan and Taichung, respectively.

2. Themed restaurants
If literal toilet humor (eating out of miniature urinals and toilet bowls) is your idea of an amuse bouche, Taiwan provides a belly full of laughs.
Modern Toilet restaurants address taboos pertaining to dining etiquette, posing witty rhetoric on websites such as: "To eat or to pee? Now that is the question."
At the other extreme, you can get a cutesy overdose at a Hello Kitty namesake cafe, where everything from burger buns to soup bowls is shaped like the mouthless cartoon cat. (For more on the kitty obsession, read point 9 below.)
What's that? Can't get enough pink and glitter?
That's OK, because Taiwan is home to the world's first Barbie-themed restaurant, with Mattel-approved smotherings of pink plastic and frilly tutus.
Previous themed restaurants in Taiwan have included a cafe based on an Airbus A380, complete with trolly dollies serving food and drinks from a cart, as well as restaurants with jail, hospital and school-inspired themes.
3. Free WiFi
Since 2011, Taiwanese citizens have been able to log onto iTaiwan, the island's free WiFi network.
Taiwan is one of the first places in the world to offer free WiFi on a mass scale.
In June 2013, the service was rolled out to tourists in four of the five largest cities, using more than 4,400 hotspots.
Visitors can sign up for an iTaiwan account with their passport at Taiwan Tourism Bureau centers and offices in transportation stations, then receive complimentary WiFi in Taipei, New Taipei, Taichung and Tainan.

4. Chinese artifacts Heaven for Chinese history buffs.
You might think it'd be in Beijing or Shanghai, but the National Palace Museum in Taipei houses the largest collection of Chinese artifacts and artwork in the world.
The impressive permanent collection comprises more than 650,000 items.
Chinese history is told through bronze statues, jade carvings, calligraphy, lacquerware and other historical pieces -- many of which belonged to Chinese imperial families -- including an intriguingly life-like, meat-shaped stone and a jadeite cabbage.
Despite several rounds of building expansion, only a fraction of the collection is on display (no more than 10,000 items at any one time), making the museum worth returning to several times a year.

5. Animated news
With an army of about 400 animators, Next Media Animation (NMA), a Taiwan-based animation studio, can turn any news story into a cartoon in as fast as 90 minutes ('making-of' video here).
More impressively -- the videos are usually satirical, outrageous and hilarious.
The studio, created by a Hong Kong media tycoon, takes infotainment to another level.
Founded in 2007 to create CGI-animated videos for news without real footage for Apple Daily News in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the talents of Taiwan's animators were exposed to the world with the 2009 release of their hilarious video of what might have happened during Tiger Woods' infamous car crash.
In the video, now ex-wife Elin Nordegren chases Tiger Woods' car with a golf club after finding out about Woods' affair.
After the video went viral, the company decided to service international audiences in Japanese and English.
Some of the team's most popular recent works include a video about the execution of Kim Jong-un's uncle and a review of five stories that must die in 2014.
6. Mock meat
One of the world's most vegetarian-friendly destinations, Taiwan offers 6,000 or so restaurants serving an impressive variety of delicious vegetarian fare to feed the 10% of the country that shuns meat.
But while it can't beat India in terms of the abundance and variety of vegetarian dishes on offer, Taiwan is the best place to hit when you're craving meat but don't actually want to eat any. That's right, we're talking about mock meat.
Given how important flesh is to the traditional Chinese diet, it's no surprise Taiwan's fake meat -- usually made of soy protein or wheat gluten -- can fool even hardcore carnivores.
Yes, there have been scandals that revealed actual meat inside supposed mock meat dishes. But it's is a thriving industry here and is considered a staple across Taiwan.
Mock meat stir-fries in particular taste surprisingly like the real thing.

7. Little League baseball Taiwan ballers have no problem stepping up to the plate.
Baseball may be Taiwan's most popular sport -- diamonds are almost as common as dumplings around the island.
Taiwan holds the record for the most Little League World Series championship titles (17), nearly double that of its closest runner-up, Japan.
Adding to a cabinet of trophies, a team from Taiwan won the 2013 Junior League Baseball Junior World Series.
8. National health coverage In a year when the Obamacare debacle played out in global headlines, it's worth to noting that Taiwan has what many call the best universal healthcare system in the world.
Legal residents can visit any specialist in the country.
Docs anywhere will pull up their entire medical record via smart card, consult and prescribe Chinese medicine and/or prescription drugs.
Fees are billed directly to and reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Administration, whose 2% administrative costs are the lowest in the world.

Sky-high kitty obsession.
9. Hello Kitty obsession
Taiwan's obsession with the Japanese-born Sanrio character doesn't stop at feline-themed restaurants.
Taiwan holds the distinction of being the first in the world to be honored with Hello Kitty-branded beer.
Brewed by Taiwan Tsing Beer, the drink purred its way onto the shelves earlier this year.
The light brew features fruity flavors, from lime to a distinctly avant garde banana infusion.
Eva Airways in 2013 made headlines with the resurrection of its themed planes, which feature the ubiquitous cat on everything from exterior liveries to headrest covers to fruit, which is cut in the shape of you know what.
Eva Airways' dedicated Hello Kitty Jets site offers horizon-expanding trivia, including Hello Kitty's height (five apples tall) and weight (three apples).
The Grand Hi-Lai Hotel in Kaohsiung offers Hello Kitty-themed rooms, the cat's iconic ribbon and/or silhouette stamped on everything within eye(sore)'s reach.
Pink kitty curtains, kitty bath amenities, kitty tea set and a radio that plays Hello Kitty music are all involved.
Not reaching for the insulin shot yet? Then you can book a breakfast date with a talking and moving "live" Hello Kitty.

10. Little dumplings Yes, we recognize xiaolongbao as a delicacy homegrown in Shanghai, but Taiwan is slowly taking over the dumpling world, one broth-filled bite at a time.
Starting from a single shop in Taipei, Din Tai Fung now serves its famed xiaolongbao in destinations as far flung as Australia, Thailand and the United States.
Two of its Hong Kong branches have earned a coveted Michelin star, with the mothership Xinyi store in Taipei sneaking into the Miele Guide.
Not bad for a chain restaurant, and not a "fancy" one at that.
When Tom Cruise visited Taiwan in 2013, he joined in on the 18-pleats-per-dumpling action with a cooking class at the shop's Taipei 101 branch.
Even better? CNN put Din Tai Fung at number two on its list of best franchises for travelers.
