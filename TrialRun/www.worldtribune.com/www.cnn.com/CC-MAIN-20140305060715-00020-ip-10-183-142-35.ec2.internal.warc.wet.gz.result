Work and class can mean better careersStory HighlightsEconomy sends more workers back to school for extra degreesMany must balance balanced work, studies and their family Seeking career advancement and marketability or following a dream Next Article in Living » By Rachel Zupek CareerBuilder.com writer	Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com.
Today's economy has many people returning to school in lieu of working full time, while others have chosen to enhance their education to make themselves more marketable to employers. Many workers returning to school face balancing their studies with their jobs and families. In a CareerBuilder survey of more than 8,000 workers, 21 percent said they were going to school to make themselves more viable for employers. Of that group surveyed in March, 7 percent go to school full time, 3 percent attend part time and 5 percent take classes online. Have you toyed with the idea of going back to school, but didn't think you could? Here are 10 stories from workers who thought they didn't have time for school and how they made it work. Aimee Cirucci, writer/editor/public relations specialist After seven years working in various marketing communications jobs, I quit my job, sold my home and, at age 29, moved back in with my parents for six months while I found work and made my dream of going back to school for a graduate degree a reality. I wish I hadn't let seven years pass thinking this wasn't possible. I am currently finishing up an MS in communication management. I received a teaching assistantship that covered one year of my education and discovered a deep love of university teaching. I applied and was accepted to the Ph.D. program and will likely begin in 2010. I really do think that if you leap, a net will appear -- for me it has completely been the case. The hard part is just getting the courage to take that leap. Jessica Lieu, account executive Don't Miss My co-worker stole my idea -- now what? 10 little-known fields with great job opportunities Why don't employers call me back?
More CareerBuilder.com stories
I decided to jump headfirst into [a] master's program six months after being hired as a full-time PR account executive. While I was initially hesitant to tackle work and school at the same time, I decided that being in both academic and professional worlds at the same time would up my learning curve. I currently juggle a 45-plus hour workweek with night classes, papers, presentations, group projects and a borderline caffeine addiction. While it can be overwhelming at times, the payoff is in being able to draw parallels between my academic and professional worlds, and using these parallels to improve the quality of my work. If that means sacrificing the occasional happy hour or weekend to prepare for class or write a paper, I think that that is a fair tradeoff. Joshua Fahrenbruck, corporate communications I just completed my undergraduate degree, and am planning to start on my MBA next month -- while working full time and getting married. I have been employed at the same company for seven years and went back to school to make sure I could continue to be upwardly mobile. I had 12 credit hours when I started; two-and-a-half years later, the degree was complete. A second reason for finishing my degree was to make sure, if I do choose to find another job, I would be marketable and could maintain or increase my level of compensation and benefits. Kami Gray, wardrobe stylist I decided to go back to school to become a costume designer for films. I've loved fashion all my life and just decided to go for it. For financial reasons, I couldn't stop working; for the next two-and-a-half years, I earned a second BS in fashion design while working full time, going to school full time and raising two middle schoolers. I worked hard in school and managed to become the salutatorian of my graduating class. With a little luck and perseverance, I landed a job as a wardrobe stylist for national TV commercials. About a year and a half ago, I combined my love of fashion with my love of healthy eating and living and wrote a bestseller, called "THE DENIM DIET: Sixteen Simple Habits To Get You Into Your Dream Pair of Jeans." My take on going back to school? Do it and do it now! Yes, I'm still paying off student loans, but school is invaluable. Confidence and a can-do attitude can take you places and for me, it all started with getting more educated. Keith Lukes, vice president of business development I went back to school [for my bachelor's degree] in 1996. Right after I started, my wife and I had our first child and my career was starting to take off. As I rose through the ranks, I was working 50-70 hours a week, while taking two to three classes each semester. Trying to balance all of that with a newborn was difficult but I knew without a degree I would not be able to advance my career. Finally in 2001, I graduated with my bachelor's degree in communication systems. At my graduation ceremony, I joked that I was an "11th year senior." Three months after graduation, I took a position with a small IT firm. Without my degree, it is very unlikely I would have been given that opportunity. I have made partner and I am currently our vice president of business development. The degree helped get me in the door and the education I received has been extremely valuable throughout my career. If I had not gone back to school, I am confident I would not have achieved the same successes. Kelly Stettner, administrative assistant In 2006, I began investigating options for finishing my bachelor's degree. I applied for financial aid and enrolled in a program while pregnant with our second child; I had our son in July 2006 and began the low-residency degree program that fall. After two on-campus semesters, in which I did the bulk of my work at home and went to the Brattleboro, Vermont, campus one weekend each month, I switched over to a strictly online option through the same program. That worked even better for me, and I was able to graduate this past January. I am now looking into master's programs. Nathaniel Williams, president/CEO I am president/CEO of a human services agency. I attained four graduate degrees in four years while my wife and I had four kids. I hold a master's degree in human services, a master's degree in public administration, master's degree in business administration, and a doctorate degree in education. I'm now adjunct teaching at one of my alma maters two nights a week. I found time for school by strategically planning and partnering with all the people in my life; I did not do it alone. Sally Berry, tourism professional I went back to school full time while working and got my master's degree in management in January 2008. It took two years and I am a single parent as well. I also traveled for my job at the time and was always doing homework in airports, on flights and at night in my hotel room. It was so difficult and I thought it would never end. But it did and I am so happy and proud to have my master's degree. My advice would be to pare down your obligations and your standards of housekeeping and cooking; maintain the very basics to keep home and family operating. It was good for my kids to see me work so hard and they all pitched in and helped. School and work is a short-term challenge, but the degree lasts forever! Susan Peters, mortgage consultant I graduated in September of 2008. I balanced school, work and family for three-and-a-half years while I pursued a degree in business management. I attended class one night a week for those three-and-a-half years at a local campus and graduated with a 3.99 GPA, a feat I never dreamed was possible. Both my husband and I attended college at night when we were into our 50s, and we were met with great success. All this was accomplished while we were putting our three children through college the conventional way and holding down full-time jobs. Terese Irwin, special events manager I have worked full time since just before I turned 21, when I left college without a degree. Although I started school again just two years later, it took me another 10 years to complete my bachelor's degree and two associate degrees. I finished my bachelor's of business administration last December. I swore I was finished; after 12 years of part-time school and full-time work, I was tired. Although I absolutely love my job, [given the economy,] I had to look at reality: My bachelor's degree alone was not going to open the doors I'd like to walk through. I have enrolled in graduate school and start again this August to pursue my master's degree in international affairs.

Tropical Storm Bonnie takes aim at Florida, Gulf of MexicoBy the CNN Wire Staff The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows the projected path of a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico. STORY HIGHLIGHTSLouisiana declares emergency as storm approachesThad Allen orders ships at BP well site to shoreWeather system upgraded to tropical stormLatest computer models show the storm moving into the Gulf of Mexico Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A weather system moving over the southern Bahamas has been upgraded to a tropical storm, with sustained winds now reported at 40 miles an hour, as it heads toward the southern tip of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. The system has been named Tropical Storm Bonnie. At 11 p.m. ET, it was moving northwest at 14 miles an hour as it approached the northwestern Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center. It could pick up strength as it moves over the long stretch of open water in the Gulf of Mexico, but the latest computer models do not show it becoming a hurricane, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Forecasters had predicted that it would cross over central Florida, but the models now show it passing farther south, over the Florida Keys or the Straits of Florida and then into the Gulf. The storm is expected to pass the southern tip of Florida on Friday afternoon and then make landfall Sunday between New Orleans and the Beaumont-Port Arthur area in southeastern Texas. Myers said it's more likely to bear down on Louisiana. And on that path, it could push oil in the Gulf from the BP oil spill to shore. Video: Bonnie takes aim at Gulf

But at this point, no oil has spilled into the Gulf for the past seven days, with BP's crippled well contained with a cap that appears to be bearing up under "integrity" tests. BP's chief operating officer, Doug Suttles, said Thursday that skimmers had been able to recover only 56 barrels of oil the day before, because that's all they could find. With the weather turning bad, BP has suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well. And late Thursday, the federal official overseeing the effort, retired Adm. Thad Allen, ordered ships in the area to come to shore. That could delay operations at the well site for 10 to 14 days. But Allen said there's enough confidence in the well that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather. Ships used to skim oil off the surface are likely to have to come ashore as well. Currently, 215 are operating off the coast of Louisiana. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has issued an emergency declaration, intended to speed state help to parishes that need it, when the storm hits. He said mandatory evacuations are not expected, but parishes might call for voluntary evacuations in some low-lying areas. The weather system is drenching the Bahamas and has caused flooding in Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Florida's east coast, from Golden Beach south to the Keys, and along the west coast, northward to Bonita Beach. In Monroe County, Florida, which comprises the Keys, officials warned boaters to secure their vessels and remain in port until winds and seas subside. They warned drivers to use extreme caution on the Overseas Highway, especially on exposed bridges. The hurricane center predicted that the storm would bring 2 to 4 inches of rain to south Florida, with isolated areas receiving as much as 6 inches. The central and northwest Bahamas are likely to receive slightly more, the hurricane center said. CNN's Anna Rhett Miller contributed to this report.

Controversial serial killer's paintings go on display in Las Vegas By the CNN Wire Staff 'Pogo the Clown' self-portrait was done by killer John Wayne Gacy, whose art is on sale in Las Vegas. STORY HIGHLIGHTSExhibit coordinator: "I see it as an opportunity to help from something that was bad"The exhibit of John Wayne Gacy's artwork includes a painting of Jeffrey Dahmer's skullGacy created the 74 pieces of art while he was on death row awaiting execution Among the paintings expected to be displayed is a self-portrait that Gacy gave to pen-palsFor more on this story, see CNN affiliate KTNV (CNN) -- A Las Vegas art coordinator's planned charity sale of serial killer John Wayne Gacy's paintings is under fire from the very crime victims group that is supposed to benefit from the proceeds. The National Center for Victims of Crime is demanding that its name not be associated with the exhibit, entitled "Multiples: The Artwork of John Wayne Gacy," saying it did not agree to be a beneficiary of the sale. In a written statement Thursday to CNN affiliate KTNV, the crime victims group said it sent a cease-and-desist letter to the gallery owner. Since word spread that Gacy's work would be displayed at the Arts Factory beginning this month through September, the event has been surprisingly controversial in a city where very little surprises. Westly Myles, the owner of the Arts Factory, said he opted to coordinate the show because he believed Gacy's work would provoke discussion and provide financial help to those who have been hurt by crime. "People can think what they like, I see it as an opportunity to help from something that was bad," Myles said. Gacy was convicted of raping and killing 33 boys and young men during a six-year span that culminated with his capture in 1978. Most of his victims were buried in and around his home. He was dubbed "the Killer Clown" because he often performed as "Pogo the Clown" at events for children. While awaiting execution, Gacy began painting. After his execution in 1994, his attorney auctioned off his artwork. Some of it was purchased and destroyed in a bonfire attended by 300 people, including some family members of Gacy's victims. Gacy's paintings have often generated controversy in galleries across the nation. "Multiples: The Artwork of John Wayne Gacy," is meant to reflect the multiple aspects of his life, according to johnwaynegacyart.com, a website set up to promote the show. "We are familiar with multiple aspects of Gacy's story. He worked multiple jobs, lived multiple lives and committed multiple crimes," the site said. "What we are unfamiliar with is the art Gacy created while awaiting execution: multiple paintings." Seventy-four pieces will be put up for sale at the Las Vegas exhibition. They include pencil drawings and audio recordings, and paintings of skulls, clowns and the seven dwarves from the Snow White fairy tale. Included among the collection is an oil painting entitled "Dahmer Skull," which is price at $2,000 and was inspired by serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. But perhaps the most controversial piece is a self-portrait entitled "Goodbye Pogos" listed at $4,500. Gacy reportedly gave these portraits to "close pen-pals at the end of his life," according the website. Also for sale, according to the site, are reproduction and merchandising rights to Gacy's artwork. Myles said the proceeds would be divided evenly among the charities. If the crime victims group doesn't want the money, Myles said he would find another organization to donate the proceeds. Meanwhile, two other organizations named as beneficiaries of the sale say they are reconsidering accepting the money. . "I think anyone would be pretty creeped out by it," Anne Mulford, the board president of the Contemporary Arts Center, told KTNV. The Contemporary Arts Center, a nonprofit gallery, is among those to receive monies from the sale. "I'll just be honest with you, that's how I feel, I don't want to see the art," Mulford said.

New Orleans police officer resigns after post on Trayvon Martin
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 10:28 PM EDT, Wed March 28, 2012
Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed February 26 as he walked back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NOPD superintendent: "(I) believe it is in the best interest of this department and this city"
Officer Jason Giroir was suspended without pay on Monday
"Act like a Thug Die like one!" he wrote on the website of CNN afiliate WWL
Editor's note: The killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has sparked a national dialogue on race; now CNN wants to hear from you. At 8 p.m. ET Thursday at CNN studios in New York, Soledad O'Brien is hosting a town hall meeting called "Beyond Trayvon: Race and Justice in America." The special will air at 8 p.m. ET Friday on CNN.
(CNN) -- A New Orleans police officer who posted an offensive comment online about slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin resigned on Tuesday.
Superintendent Ronal Serpas accepted his resignation.
"My responsibility to the people of New Orleans, as well as to the professional officers on this police force, demanded I take swift action in this matter. I have accepted Giroir's resignation, and believe it is in the best interest of this department and this city," Serpas said.
Under a news story on Martin, officer Jason Giroir wrote on the website of CNN affiliate WWL: "Act like a Thug Die like one!"
What the witnesses are saying
Martin's father: 'Trayvon is the victim'
'Stand Your Ground' law under scrutiny He admitted to the post and submitted his resignation after being told Serpas was calling for a pre-termination hearing, according to police.
The superintendent suspended Giroir without pay on Monday, when news of the incident broke.

Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed February 26 as he walked back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to a convenience store. Police say he was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea. He was shot by George Zimmerman, who has told authorities he was acting in self defense.

Afghanistan vet finds a new way to serve
By Jeremy Bradley, CNN
updated 12:02 PM EST, Wed January 2, 2013
Ricardo Benejam served two deployments in Afghanistan and now works at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ricardo Benejam was born and raised in New York City and saw the twin towers fall
Benejam enlisted in the Army and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2007 and 2009
He now works at the 9/11 Memorial as a visitor services host
Benejam: It's like you're continuing to serve because you're telling the story (CNN) -- Ricardo Benejam is a born-and-bred New Yorker. He grew up with a view of the World Trade Center from the window of his childhood apartment in lower Manhattan.
On September 11, 2001, he was a freshman in high school when the twin towers fell.
"I had actually blurted out, 'We'll be going to war,'" he recalls. "You knew it wasn't an accident. That was my first thought at 14 [years old]."
He witnessed the devastation firsthand as he walked home that day.
"I saw cars that were littered with dust," he said. "I saw people in business suits that were littered in dust."
Before the attack, Benejam was considering a career in law enforcement or the military. His father, who died of a heart attack in 2002, worked briefly for the New York City Police Department, and his uncle served in the Navy during the Vietnam War.
In 2006, the day before his 19th birthday, Benejam was sworn into the U.S. Army.
"One of the main reasons was a promise that I kept to my father that I would enlist," Benejam said, "and the second reason was the 9/11 attacks. I definitely wanted to serve as a result of that."
Benejam was stationed in Ft. Drum, New York, where he trained as a human resources specialist. He first deployed to Afghanistan for three months in 2007. He went back in 2009, this time staying a full year.
"I did my job," said Benejam. "I did what I was sent to do and I supported those guys in my unit."
In 2011, his service ended. He set his sights on continuing his education and working, but coming home wasn't easy.
"The first week or so, I'd be waking up and I'm like, 'I'm going to be late for formation,'" remembers Benejam. "And I'm like, 'There's no more formation.'"
Families face more challenges when military parents return
Benejam credits the work ethic he learned in the Army with his success at home, saying, "I think what actually helped me transition a little bit better is that I started school right after I got out."
He is just two semesters away from getting his bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Monroe College in the Bronx.
Benejam visits ground zero several times a week now, not just to pay respect to his fellow veterans or to reflect on the events that inspired him to serve his country. He works at the 9/11 Memorial.
"Working down there, it's like you're continuing to serve because you're telling the story of what happened and what was there before," he said.
Part of what makes his job so special is the bond he shares with other veterans visiting the site.
"You meet a veteran, and it's almost like seeing a brother or sister," Benejam said. "A lot of us have deployed (as a result of) what happened on 9/11."
On the day CNN visited Benejam at the 9/11 Memorial, he was answering visitors' questions about the "Survivor Tree."
"It's the only tree that actually survived the initial attacks," he explains. "It actually survived not only the attacks itself but already two nor'easters and two hurricanes."
Benejam, too, is a survivor. He's thriving in his post-military life.
When CNN asked what advice he would offer to other veterans coming home, his reply was reflective and hopeful, much like memorial where he works.
"It may start off rocky, but, you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel. Just stay positive, and good things will happen."

UK ministers consider offering communities fracking sweeteners
By By Jim Pickard, Elizabeth Rigby and Guy Chazan
updated 9:16 AM EDT, Fri May 3, 2013
Environmentalists worry that the process can pollute ground water and cause emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ministers prepare to announce UK's shale-gas reserves are much larger than previously estimated
Britain's only fracking operation was suspended after two minor earthquakes in 2011
Fracking is extraction of gas and oil by pumping water at high pressure into shale rock
(CNN) -- The government is proposing to bribe communities with cheaper energy bills in exchange for dropping opposition to local fracking projects as part of plans to push ahead with shale-gas extraction.
Several options to cajole rural England to accept the contentious drilling schemes are being discussed as ministers prepare to announce that the UK's shale-gas reserves are much larger than previously estimated.
Fracking, an extraction technique that involves pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale rock to release trapped pockets of oil and gas, has transformed the US energy market, triggering a production boom that pushed gas prices to 10-year lows last year.
Environmentalists worry that the process can pollute ground water and cause emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
CNN Explains: Fracking
The government's paper on "community benefits" will propose policies that aim to persuade locals to drop their resistance to fracking in northwest and southeast England, where the largest shale-gas deposits are found.
The biggest incentive being discussed by the coalition is cheaper household energy bills for people in the area, according to those familiar with the discussions.
Neighbourhoods could also be offered funding for new sports clubs or community centres and other projects to improve local amenities.
The House of Commons energy select committee said on Friday that communities affected by shale-gas projects "should expect to receive, and share in, some of the benefits of development".
It suggested that local authorities hosting shale ventures should also be allowed to retain business rates.
The system would be similar to the "planning gain" whereby councils that give planning permission to property developments can force the developer to pay for certain infrastructure improvements, such as roads and schools. A separate paper will make a similar proposal for new wind farms.
The government could still face big protests against fracking sites, reminiscent of the widespread grassroots Tory hostility to onshore wind turbines and to the HS2 high-speed railway.
One Conservative MP, Laura Sandys, has said that planning applications for shale-gas drilling will "make onshore wind farms look like a walk in the park".
Britain's only fracking operation, by Cuadrilla Resources near Blackpool, was suspended after two minor earthquakes in 2011. It was allowed to resume last December.
Last year, the government commissioned the British Geological Survey to produce a new estimate of Britain's shale-gas reserves, which is understood to show that they are much larger than previously thought.
