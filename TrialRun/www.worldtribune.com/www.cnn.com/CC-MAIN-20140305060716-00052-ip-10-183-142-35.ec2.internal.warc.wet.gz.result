Jamie Lynn Spears pregnancy raises legal questionsStory Highlights Experts say there is a disparity in how statutory rape laws are applied Jamie Lynn Spears is 16, and her boyfriend -- the father of her child -- is 18 There has been no talk of criminal prosecution involving the couple Experts: Attorneys choose when to prosecute, leading to unfairness Next Article in Entertainment » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- The announced pregnancy of Jamie Lynn Spears -- the 16-year-old children's television star and younger sister of beleaguered pop star Britney Spears -- is casting new light on how states deal with the thorny issue of consensual sex among teens. Jamie Lynn Spears, shown in September, stars in the popular Nickelodeon series "Zoey 101." Spears, the star of Nickelodeon's "Zoey 101," told OK! Magazine that she's pregnant and that the father is her 18-year-old boyfriend. There has been no public talk of criminal prosecution in the case. Consensual sex between the two may well have been legal, depending on where and when it took place. But critics of the nation's statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison and land them on sex-offender registries. Watch CNN's Sunny Hostin on what the law says » "You have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced," said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. "I have no problem at all with nailing adults who sleep with children, but I have a problem with the prosecution of teenagers in consensual relationships. "What this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases." Watch a psychologist talk about how Spears' pregnancy could lead to parents talking to their kids about sex » In Louisiana, where Spears lives, it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years. Out in the Open
A look at how state laws differ regarding teen sex are brought "Out in the Open"

In California, where she sometimes tapes her television show, it's a misdemeanor to have sex with someone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older. Someone more than three years older could be charged with a felony. According to OK! Magazine, which first reported the news Tuesday, Spears said the father of her baby is longtime boyfriend Casey Aldridge. Turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them. But that's a recipe for legal problems, he said. The issue drew international attention when a Georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17. In 2005, Genarlow Wilson was tried for the rape of a 17-year-old girl at a hotel-room party. While he was found not guilty of that charge, he was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act with the 15-year-old -- even though he was less than two years older. Georgia law, which has since been changed, required a mandatory 10-year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation and required Wilson to register as a sex offender when he was released. Under the revised Georgia law, the act now would be a misdemeanor. Don't Miss How do you talk to kids about Britney's sister?

Now 21, Wilson was released from prison in October -- after serving more than two years -- when the state Supreme Court ruled his sentence was "grossly disproportionate to his crime." "The current laws leave too much to prosecutorial discretion," Turley said. "We saw in the Wilson case how prosecutorial discretion can lead to grotesque results." He said statutory rape prosecutions of teens are more common in Southern states and small towns than they are elsewhere in the country or in big cities. B.J. Bernstein, Wilson's attorney, argued throughout his case that Wilson was imprisoned for an act that, while perhaps morally questionable, probably is going on among teens everywhere. "If you prosecuted, even with misdemeanors, all those cases, you'd clog up the justice system with kids having sex," she said. "It's a social issue -- and it may be something that parents don't want to happen or wish wouldn't happen at that age -- but it shouldn't be a crime." Spears, who turned 16 on April 4 and says she is 12 weeks into her pregnancy, told the magazine she plans to raise her child in Louisiana, "so it can have a normal family life." Nickelodeon released a statement saying the network respects Spears' decision "to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation."

Cyclone death toll hits 1,700Story Highlights More than 1,700 people dead, toll expected to rise, official says 15,000 people are injured following Thursday's tropical Cyclone Sidr U.N. World Food Programme has food for 400,000 people for three days Power outages, massive traffic jams and poor phone service in Dhaka Next Article in World » Read VIDEO PHOTOS MAP DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN) -- More than 1,700 people have died in Bangladesh after a devastating tropical cyclone ripped through the western coast of the country, and the toll is expected to rise, a government spokesman tells CNN. Families stand amid the wreckage caused by the cyclone Friday in southern Bangladesh.more photos » Brig. Gen. Qazi Abedus Samad, director of operations for the country's armed forces, told CNN Saturday the toll had reached 1,723, and the figure is expected to rise. As flood waters recede, aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the counting is done. They face debris-blocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent communications. In addition to the dead, another 15,000 people have been injured. Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing. Cyclone Sidr, with sustained winds of at least 131 mph (210 kph), made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Bangladesh near the border with India, unleashing floodwaters. Government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN by telephone that the government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues. He said the extent of the cyclone's damage may be much worse because emergency relief had not been able to reach remote areas. The government has identified the 12 worst districts -- all of them located on the southern coast -- out of the 23 affected by the cyclone, Munaim said.

Bangladesh: At the mercy of cyclones
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference The Bangladeshi air force, army and navy are working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. Power is still out in much of the country but it is being restored. Watch how the cyclone spawns a large relief effort » Vince Edwards, national director of the relief agency World Vision in Bangladesh, said the high wind speeds of Cyclone Sidr have laid waste to the all-important rice crop and caused a huge loss of livestock. He said 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members. World Vision is deploying 135 staffers and 7,000 volunteers to provide food, shelter and other relief. The group is appealing for $1.5 million in further funds to assist some 9.300 families rebuild their homes. In Dhaka -- about 200 miles north of the worst-hit region -- there were power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service, CNN's Cal Perry said from the city. "From an infrastructure perspective, the country absolutely has been brought to its knees," he said. Red Crescent spokeswoman Nabiha Chowdhury told CNN that communication with her agency's teams who have arrived in the stricken area is spotty, but they have resources with them to immediately help people with water purification, which she said was a top priority. Those teams have cash with them to buy relief supplies from local wholesalers, said Chowdhury, who said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing. Chowdhury said about 600,000 people had fled, adding that about 2 million people lived along the coast. The U.N. World Food Programme said it has enough high-energy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for several days. Another humanitarian group, Save The Children, appealed for aid from the public. "Many families have lost everything, including their homes and their crops, and they are struggling to survive," said Kelly Stevenson, Save the Children's Bangladesh director. "We are appealing to the U.S. public to support our efforts to assist children and families affected by this disaster. We remain very concerned about possible outbreaks of cholera and severe diarrhea due to the lack of access to clean water," he said in a written statement. The U.S. Department of State pledged Friday pledging "to work with the government and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster." Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh, anticipating the storm, pre-positioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was expected to approve plans to send up to three Navy amphibious warships, with up to 3,500 Marines, to locations off the coast of Bangladesh to assist in relief efforts.

9/11 workers approve settlement with New York City From Jesse Solomon, CNN A worker searches through debris at ground zero. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: NJ Sen Frank Lautenberg praises deal, pledges work on long-term solution for workersDeal paves way for city payout of at least $625 million to ground zero workersPlaintiffs narrowly OK'd deal, which required 95 percent of some 10,000 people to approveSome plaintiffs signed onto the agreement to avoid continued litigation

September 11 Attacks
New York (CNN) -- A settlement in New York City will pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to ground zero workers exposed to toxic debris after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, lawyers said Friday. Plaintiffs narrowly approved the deal after facing a Tuesday night deadline that required 95 percent of some 10,000 people who worked at ground zero to approve the measure, according to Marc Berns, an attorney for the plaintiffs. In March, U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected an earlier settlement, saying that it did not do enough to address the workers' ailments. Friday's agreement concludes a seven-year fight between the city and first responders, who have said they were not properly outfitted for rescue and cleanup efforts after the 9/11 attacks, leaving them exposed to toxic dust that later prompted respiratory health issues. The deal paves the way for at least $625 million in city payouts. "It's a fantastic deal for everybody," Berns said. "Is it perfect? No. Is there a perfect deal? No. But this is as good a deal as you're going to get." Former New York City Police Department Detective John Walcott, who has leukemia, was less enthusiastic. "There's too much risk and no guarantees," and he rejected the settlement because he did not trust how the funds were going to be allocated, he said. Kenny Specht, a former firefighter suffering from thyroid cancer, said he signed on to the settlement to avoid continued litigation. "I supported the settlement because it was the only game in town," he said. "What you're being offered is not everything you deserve, but your case won't get dismissed." New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the deal "a fair and just resolution of these claims, protecting those who came to the aid of this city when we needed it most." "We will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring of those who were present at ground zero," Bloomberg said on Friday. Congressional reaction to the announcement came quickly. "The agreement reached today on the 9/11 settlement is a positive step for many ailing first responders -- but the problem isn't over," New York Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Peter King and Carolyn Maloney said in a joint statement. "Nearly everyone agrees that the settlement does not provide adequate funding to fully compensate those who are injured among the more than 10,500 plaintiffs in this case, nor does it cover the tens of thousands of 9/11 responders and survivors who are injured but have not filed lawsuits." New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg praised the deal, pledging to "continue working to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 health bill in the Senate to create a long-term solution that meets our responsibility to the heroes of September 11th." Those who signed onto Friday's settlement would still be eligible for the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. If passed, the bill would provide $7.4 billion in aid and medical coverage for 9/11 workers and survivors exposed to toxic substances after the World Trade Center attacks. The House approved the measure on a mostly partisan 268-160 vote in September. Earlier this week, Bloomberg and state lawmakers called on the U.S. Senate to pass the bill.

Hundreds evacuated as wildfire rages in southern Arizona By the CNN Wire Staff Official: Campfire caused AZ wildfireSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: The raging Wallow fire is 33% contained1,700 homes are evacuated in southern Arizona in another fireMonument fire in southern Arizona is 17% containedThe Wallow fire is Arizona's biggest but not the most destructiveRead more about the Arizona wildfires at CNN affiliate KNXV. (CNN) -- A growing blaze fueled by strong winds prompted the mandatory evacuation of hundreds of people in southern Arizona on Thursday, authorities said. Wind gusts of up to 35 miles per hour were reported in the area, and people in 1,700 of approximately 3,230 homes were ordered out. The Monument fire, which has scorched 40 homes in southern Arizona, roared in the Huachuca Mountains near the Mexican border and just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona. The 9,300-acre blaze is only 17% contained. Portions of Highway 92 were closed on the edge of the Coronado National Memorial/Coronado National Forest, said Carol Capas, spokeswoman for the Cochise County Sheriff's Office. "We had a situation where a family said they were staying behind," Capas told CNN. "We got a teenage daughter who later called us from that home and said she didn't want to be there so our officers went over there and got her out." Hundreds of people in other areas were evacuated, she said. Arizona wildfire is state's largest ever

The sheriff's office urged residents to be patient. "Public safety officials are doing everything possible to get people to safety in a timely and professional manner, so the cooperation of the public is critical," it said. Someone had been detained for attempting to ram a marked patrol unit doing road closures, the office said in a statement. Red-flag warnings indicated that the region was at the mercy of heat, wind and low humidity. "This whole part of the country is in extreme drought," said Dale Thompson, a spokesman for fire crews. "Grass will take off like gasoline." Meanwhile, crews battled the massive Wallow fire in eastern Arizona on several fronts Thursday as they dealt with strong winds and low relative humidity. The raging blaze started last month in eastern Arizona, devouring hundreds of thousands of acres before spilling into New Mexico. It has grown into the largest fire ever in Arizona, according to fire officials. It had burned 478,016 acres and was 33% contained as of Thursday evening, officials said. Crews battled a spot fire on the south side of the city of Eagar. The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for the area Friday, warning of strong and gusty winds in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were at 5% to 12%, it said. The Wallow fire -- centered in a sparsely populated national forest -- is the largest but not the state's most destructive in terms of property. It has destroyed 32 homes and 36 outbuildings, including sheds and barns, compared with the 468,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski fire, which destroyed 465 homes. On Thursday, firefighters focused on hazard tree removal, structure protection, improving containment lines and conducting mop-up activities, officials said. .CNN's Samuel Gardner III, Dave Alsup and Phil Gast contributed to this report.

'Give African women a voice,' say activists
By Nima Elbagir, CNN
updated 5:28 AM EST, Fri November 30, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Rainatou Sow, Marie-Claire Faray and Betty Makoni are advocates for equal rights
Through their organizations they aim to empower and inspire all African women
In 2010 the African Union launched the African Women's Decade
The initiative promotes female empowerment and gender equality
African Voices is a weekly show that highlights Africa's most engaging personalities, exploring the lives and passions of people who rarely open themselves up to the camera. Follow the team on Twitter.
(CNN) -- In 2010 the African Union launched a decade-long initiative to promote women's empowerment and put female rights at the heart of development in the billion-strong continent.
Dubbed African Women's Decade (AWD 2010-2020), the ambitious scheme aims to create the conditions for the active participation of women in the socio-economic development of the continent.
Now, more than two years after the Nairobi launch, African Voices caught up with three diaspora-based, prominent African activists to discuss the current state of women's rights in the continent.
CNN spoke to Rainatou Sow, Marie-Claire Faray and CNN Hero Betty Makoni -- an edited version of the interviews follows.
Rainatou Sow Rainatou Sow is the founder and executive director of "Make Every Woman Count," an organization that monitors female rights in every African country. The Guinean activist was named "Inspirational Woman of 2012" by the UK group "Women 4 Africa." CNN: "Make Every Woman Count" publishes an annual report detailing the treatment of women in each country to remind people that African women are watching.
Africa's advocates for equal rights
Rainatou Sow: Yes, that's the message. Basically, when they launched African Women's Decade it was in Nairobi -- you had people from all over coming, delegates, African governments, it was a big feast. But then after a few months you hardly heard about it -- because of the credit crunch basically we didn't hear about financing going into women's projects there and it was really calm.
So we thought what can we do? Are we going to sit down and let this decade pass away, or are we going to do something, mainly us as the younger generation.
I see this as an opportunity to really push the agenda of women's rights in Africa because most of the time African voices are lost in the field. So every year we do the overview annual report where we do all the 54 countries. We evaluate all of them, regarding what they have been doing this year on women's rights, in education, reproductive health.

That is what we are really trying to do -- to really give African women the voices they deserve.Rainatou Sow
RS: I think that's really missing. Whatever we do, we should make sure that we invite those women to come to tell their own stories because that is how you could best help her. Not you talking for her.
By using the power of social media, of the internet, really reaching women around Africa and in the diaspora here and that is what we are really trying to do -- to really give African women the voices they deserve that we haven't seen so far.
CNN: Do you think it's hard to get donors to move beyond the mindset of the emergency aid to more sustainable approaches?
RS: Yes, that is what we are trying to do. A lot of women are really raising their voices about that because there is no sustainability and that's the big problem. After so many years of aid we haven't seen an impact on the ground. So for me it is about time to maybe sit back and look at what we have done wrong and how we can improve things to try and ask the local communities and then go ask people, "so what have you already done here?"
Marie-Claire Faray
Marie-Claire Faray is an activist from the Democratic Republic of Congo who campaigns to end violence against women, especially in her home country. As a member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, she is advocating for change and pushing for action during the AWD 2010-2010.
CNN: What are you hoping to achieve with the AWD?
Establishing equal rights across Africa
Marie-Claire Faray: We really hope to bring a lot of women on board to first of all commit to changing at the individual level, local level, national level and international level. We hope to bring women from all backgrounds -- not only the lawyers, the politicians, but also the grassroots women, particularly them, to come and hold their government to account.
CNN: Because in many African countries the legal framework is there, what's been missing is the accountability.
MCF: Definitely, not only the accountability but the action plan to set changes. This decade is actually just a time frame for us to evaluate every year during this decade what achievement has been done and what challenges lie ahead of us.
But ultimately, in 2020, we want to look back and say "we have at least achieved this in this country" -- for example "in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have achieved more women in parliament, the end of violence against women, the end of sexual violence."
We want to look at places like Mali, where there is conflict right now, and see what women have achieved to end this conflict.
Marie-Claire Faray
We want to look at places like Mali, where there is conflict right now, and see what women have achieved to end this conflict.

CNN: Does it feel like no one is listening to African women as to what their priorities are? That people are coming from the outside and deciding for them?
MCF: Of course, because not only people are deciding for us, but people are talking for us. This is what the Congolese women are saying, "end the war and sexual violence in the Congo." We feel that some of the agenda that African women such as Congolese women want to put forward to end the war is not being listened to because there is another agenda so that the illegal trade of natural resources will continue in the Congo.
CNN: Many women's groups in the Congo feel not enough is being done. So it is not about getting the voices heard, it's about what happens next.
MCF: Yes, I think Gandhi said it, "if you want to see change, you start it within yourself." If we want to see change in the Congo, we have to work for that. So it's about ourselves, about working with African women all together to make that change.
Zimbabwe's victim turned survivor
Betty Makoni
Betty Makoni is a Zimbabwean activist fighting to rescue girls from sexual abuse. She was raped at the age of six and lost her mother at the age of nine. After surviving these traumas, she vowed to devote her life to protecting young women and girls from abuse. Through her program "Girl Child Network" she says she is protecting more then 300,000 girls in her home country. Among the many honors she has received, Makoni was named a CNN Hero in 2009.
CNN: You have experienced some of the worst deprivations, yet you are standing, saying "listen to me, it can be done, we can move beyond all of this, we can start over with a new generation."
Betty Makoni: Definitely, I'm coming to confirm that. People are looking at big organizations like the United Nations, SADIC or EU. They don't come to your house when you are being raped, they don't come to your community when you are being stopped from going to school.
Action begins with an individual girl like myself who was adopted into a good girls school and I said: "I've got the brains but no money, allow me in." It was my voice, so it is that voice of an African girl we are trying to say "let it come out."
So, I think let's enable; the girls in Africa, the women have been disabled, they've received handouts, they've been given fish to eat instead of the fishing rod. But we are coming to change that, to say that there is potential we can unleash.

CNN: It's easy to say that African women's voices need to be heard but often there is a huge price to be paid when African women speak out. Yourself, in the end, you had to leave Zimbabwe and come to the UK.
Even if there is a backlash we can strategically use technology to keep speaking out like I'm doingBetty Makoni
BM: I left Zimbabwe because I dealt with sensitive issues like high-profile rape cases involving children, like rape is a weapon of war.
Those are not matters that governments take so easily, but I'm saying wherever you can be positioned it's very strategic for you to continue contributing. I know my life in Zimbabwe was not going to be safe, that I can confirm, but I travel globally now, there are many countries in Africa that have accommodated me.
Africa does not only consist of a small country, Zimbabwe, it also consists of the whole continent joined together. So as African women let's not give up -- even if there is a backlash we can strategically use technology to keep speaking out like I'm doing; we can set up offices elsewhere; we can mobilize other people elsewhere to support us. So there is still hope even when you are uprooted like in my case.
CNN: If there was a message that you would like the international and donor community to hear about what women in Africa need, what would it be?
BM: The best thing would be, let's go build all these offices on the ground, in villages, rural areas, in high-density suburbs, family areas and then let's open the doors. Once we open the doors the ideas will come in. Because a solution is not far from the person who is affected by a problem -- normally persons with challenges, they have got solutions of their own.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"I ate biscuits and water," says survivor, who's identified as Reshma
Rescuers have saved more than 2,400 people, but no others in the past 10 days
Rana Plaza collapsed on April 24
Hundreds of people looking for missing relatives are waiting near the site
Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Rescuers had drilled Friday to what had been the basement garage of the nine-story building that collapsed here last month only to find that it was filled with water and held no survivors, Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain said Saturday.
But the disappointment did not last.
The late-afternoon operation had opened a hole in another part of the mound above what remained of the second floor, which had been filled with shops, he said. Perhaps alerted by the light, someone inside stuck a stick through the hole.
"When I was cutting iron rods, suddenly I found a silver-colored stick just moving from a hole, and I looked through and I saw someone calling, 'Please save me,' " rescue worker Mohammad Rubel Rana told Reuters. "Then instantly I called the army and firefighters and said, 'Please look, I heard a sound.' Then they saw her and confirmed that there was a woman."

Bangladesh's PM: 'Accidents happen' Hossain then went into action.
"I told her, mother, don't be afraid, we are here to rescue you," Hossain said, according to Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the state-run news agency. "Would you like to drink water?"
A second hole was drilled by hand, to ensure that no sparks from a machine could ignite a fire, as occurred during a previous failed rescue attempt, he told CNN in a telephone interview.
The hole -- a crescent about 1.5-feet long and 1-foot wide -- revealed Reshma, a 19-year-old garment worker, wife and mother in cramped quarters on the floor about 7 feet down.
At 5-foot, 7-inches and 143 pounds, Hossain was just able to slide down into the darkness, where Reshma was standing.
"The first word was, 'Save me, save me,' " he said. "She was very afraid, she was hyper-panicked you can say," he said. Hossain tried to calm her. "We are here," he told her. "We are not going until we save you."
Hossain then lifted the woman into the opening, from which other rescuers completed the job.
"I was just lying down in a sloping manner up to the hole and then I was pushing her body over my body so that she can just go up."
At 4:26 p.m., once she had been lifted to safety, Reshma erupted in tears, Hossain said. "She was very thankful to my team; this cry was the happiest cry she had."
Hundreds of onlookers erupted in cheers.

Survivors: Stories of hope amid disaster
Deadly train derailment: At least 38 people were killed and 37 are still missing in the small town of Lac Megantic, Quebec, where a runaway train exploded in the downtown district on Saturday, July 6. Police suspect that some of the victims were vaporized in the explosion. Look back at some of the worst industrial disasters in modern history:
Louisiana chemical plant explosion: A June 13 explosion at a chemical plant in Louisiana killed one person and forced authorities to ask people as far as 2 miles away to stay inside to avoid exposure to potentially deadly fumes. At least 75 people were injured in the blast.
China poultry plant fire: A fire which broke out in a poultry plant in northeast China on June 3 killed at least 119 people and injured another 54.
Garment factory collapse: More than 1,000 people died in the May 10 collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, Bangladesh, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters.
West, Texas, fertilizer plant explosion: 35 people died in a massive explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, on April 17. Included among the dead were 10 first responders who were trying to put out a fire at the plant before the explosion.
Fukushima nuclear plant: In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake caused a tsunami that killed nearly 16,000 people in northeast Japan and damaged backup generators at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Though all three reactors were successfully shut down, the cooling systems failed causing a nuclear meltdown and radiation leaks. The disaster was the second worst nuclear accident in history.
Bhopal chemical leak: In December 1984, almost 4,000 people died in the immediate aftermath of the leak of methyl isocyanate from a chemical plant in Bhopal, India. More than 10,000 other deaths have been blamed on related illnesses, with adverse health effects reported in hundreds of thousands of survivors. Found guilty in 2010 of negligence over the disaster: Union Carbide India Limited, which was the now-defunct subsidiary of the U.S. chemical company; the subsidiary's head; and six of his colleagues. Chernobyl: The initial death toll was 32, from the 1986 explosion in the core of a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. But the International Atomic Energy Agency estimates the total number of deaths from contamination will reach about 4,000. The disaster sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over hundreds of thousands of square miles of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The radioactive effects of the explosion were about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Halifax Harbor explosion: In December 1917, the French ammunition ship Mont Blanc and the chartered Belgian steamer Imo collided in Halifax Harbor in Nova Scotia, causing a massive explosion. Officials put the death toll at 1,950.
Benxihu/Honkeiko Colliery explosion: Guinness World Records lists the April 26, 1942, coal dust explosion at the Benxihu/Honkeiko Colliery in Benxi, China, as the world's worst coal mining disaster. It says the blast at the facility killed 1,549 people.
Boston Molasses Disaster: In January 1919, a tank containing 2.3 million gallons of molasses ruptured in Boston, causing a 15-foot high wall of molasses to pummel houses and leave 21 people dead and 150 injured.
Triangle Shirtwaist Factory disaster: In March 1911, a fire broke out at a factory in Greenwich Village, New York, as employees were leaving for the day. Most of the exits were locked with chains and the fire escape had collapsed; 146 people died in the fire.
Courrieres mining disaster: On March 10, 1906, 1,099 people died and hundreds more were injured in an explosion at the Courrieres mine in northern France, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The encyclopedia said smoke and toxic gas had been detected at the site days before the explosion but work had continued.

Photos: Industrial disasters through history
Hossain credited the fact that both he and the woman are thin with the success of the operation, given that there was little space available to widen the hole. "That was the luckiest part," he said. "Otherwise, the operation would have been very difficult."
Hossain said the trapped woman had enough room to stand and to sit, but not enough room to lie down during her more-than 16 days of confinement.
She and her family were not the only ones who were happy. Hossain's children were watching on TV they told him "my mama was crying," he said, adding that he was still focused on the recovery and hoped that more survivors would emerge.
After being given water and biscuits, Reshma was placed on a stretcher, put into an ambulance and whisked to Combined Military Hospital in Savar, the suburb of the capital city, Dhaka, where the building collapsed.
There, video showed her lying in bed, a nurse at either side connecting intravenous drips to her arms and a third nurse at the head of her bed. Whenever she raised her head to see what was going on, the nurse in the middle would gently push it back to the pillow and stroke her hair.
"She is fine now," said Capt. Ibrahim Islam, a Bangladeshi military official.
Reshma told her rescuers that she survived on dry food and water that had been tossed into the rubble in the first days after the collapse, BSS reported.
"I ate biscuits and water," she told rescuers. "But the stock dwindled two days ago."
She told doctors at the military hospital in Savar that she was wracked by thirst for the last two days of her saga, all of which was spent in the dark between floors that had pancaked in the collapse.
The rescued woman's mother-in-law, Ayesha, said she was overjoyed.
"I have not seen her yet, but I am very happy that she is alive," Ayesha said. "At least my grandchildren got their mother back. All my grandchildren are now overwhelmed."
The news spread widely and rapidly; within minutes, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina phoned the unlikely survivor and asked about her condition, then flew by helicopter to visit her.
"It's an unprecedented incident," she said afterward, according to BSS.
The news agency said Reshma is from northern Bangladesh's Dinajpur district. She was working as a swing operator for Phantom Garment, which had a factory in the Rana Plaza when it collapsed on April 24.
In addition to the water sprayed over the mound early after the disaster, water may have trickled to the second floor from recent rains, or from fire hoses employed when firefighters extinguished the blaze that erupted during the failed rescue attempt.
The rescue, which came on the same day that officials raised the death toll from the collapse by 30 to 1,043, represented a ray of cheer against an otherwise grim tableau.
The building had held thousands of people, many of them garment workers.
Though rescue workers had pulled more than 2,400 others to safety, 10 days had elapsed since anyone had been found alive.
Since then, efforts have focused on retrieving corpses from the heap of broken concrete over which bulldozers and cranes have been used to speed the cleanup. But Hossain said use of the heavy equipment is limited to areas that recovery experts are certain hold no people.
Many of the bodies have been so decomposed that authorities have struggled to identify them.
"We are near the end," Islam said.
The owners of the building and the factories are under investigation over accusations they ordered workers to enter the building on the day of the collapse despite cracks that appeared in the structure the day before.
The Bangladeshi government has faced criticism for failing to tighten safety standards in the country's thousands of garment factories, where millions of people work.
The Savar building collapsed five months after a fire at a garment factory near Dhaka killed more than 100 people. And on Wednesday, eight people died in a fire at another factory in the area.
The European Union has threatened to take trade action against Bangladesh if it doesn't improve health and safety conditions for workers.
Western retailers and clothing brands that get their products from Bangladeshi factories are also under pressure to subject their supply chains to greater scrutiny.
The smell of death continues to permeate the area, prompting people passing by on a nearby highway to cover their noses. Recovery workers combing through the debris use face masks to block the stench.
Hundreds of people looking for their missing relatives have been waiting by the nearby school where bodies are taken to be identified.
Authorities have sent some of the remains to a Dhaka hospital for DNA testing, BSS reported. Those that remain unidentified are buried.
The industrial disaster here is among the worst ever, ranking behind the 1984 chemical leak in Bhopal, India, which the Indian government said killed more than 15,000 people, many of whom were residents rather than workers.
In his 2008 book "Understanding Global Security," Peter Hough, a senior lecturer in international politics at Middlesex University in Britain, lists just 2,500 deaths in Bhopal, but said Thursday that that number included only fatalities just after the incident.
After Bhopal, he cited 1,549 deaths in a 1942 mining disaster in Hineiko, China; 1,082 deaths in a 1998 oil pipeline fire in Nigeria; and 1,060 in a 1906 mining explosion in Courrieres, France.
Though it is too late for the Bangladesh incident to be included in the soon-to-be-published third edition of his book, the building collapse will doubtless enter history books, he said.
"It's a classic case of a developing country being prepared to cut corners to feed a demand via globalization," he said in a telephone interview. "I'm sure it will be seen alongside other notable disasters. It is already up there in the top five."
Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka, and CNN's Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Joe Sterling, Jethro Mullen and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.

Golf's 'wicker men' challenge for U.S. Open stars
By Paul Gittings, CNN
updated 11:17 AM EDT, Thu June 13, 2013
The famous wicker basket flagsticks will be on full view again at the 2013 U.S. Open on the East Course at Merion.
The history of golf at the Merion club dates back to 1896, with the East Course being completed in 1912.
Merion is regarded as one of the most picturesque courses in world golf, and this sunset view from the 10th tee takes in the ninth green with the fourth green in the background. Merion's trophy cabinet reflects its staging of 18 USGA events and a host of important tournaments.
Ben Hogan plays his famous one-iron approach to the final green in the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion. It is acknowledged as one of the greatest shots in golfing history and he went on to win the tournament in a playoff. The U.S. Open trophy is paraded next to the plaque on the 18th hole which marks the point from which Hogan played his famous shot. The club used by Hogan is on public display in the USGA museum, having been stolen but then found by a collector.
A plaque in the clubhouse is dedicated to the course's designer, Scotsman Hugh Wilson, who was a member at Merion. A commemorative stone on the par-four 12th on the East Course marks the hole on which the great Bobby Jones completed golf's first "grand slam" in 1930 by winning the final of the U.S. Amateur.
Players will take aim at the wicker basket targets rather than the conventional flags, making it harder to judge the wind direction.
The wicker basket flagsticks are gathered up each night by a special machine before being put out the next morning. Leading PGA Tour professional Rickie Fowler (left) was among the victorious American Walker Cup team which beat Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the last major event to be staged at Merion in 2009. The legendary Lee Trevino won the U.S. Open at Merion in 1971 after beating Jack Nicklaus in a playoff. He has fond memories of the unique course. The changing room at Merion has a old-fashioned qualities, with massive metal lockers as the main feature.
Players will tee off at the U.S. Open right in front of the dining patio in the clubhouse.
When the original Merion club was founded in 1865, it was used for the traditional British sport of cricket. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Merion is renowned as one of the finest golf courses in the world
Legendary players have won important tournaments on the inland links
U.S. Open venue is famous for its wicker basket flags
Strong Scottish influence in the design of the East Course
(CNN) -- "I love Merion, and I don't even know her last name," legendary golfer Lee Trevino was once memorably quoted when asked about the venue for this week's U.S. Open.
"Supermex" had good cause for his admiration of the famous inland links near Philadelphia, having won the 1971 edition of the tournament after a playoff with Jack Nicklaus, no less.
Nicklaus, who went on to win a record 18 major titles, described Merion's championship East Course as "Acre for acre, maybe the best test of golf in the world."
Current No. 1 Tiger Woods is another big fan. "You have to be so disciplined to play that course," he said after a recent practice round.
So what is it about the Merion which evokes such praise -- and what will await Woods and his rivals when they bid for major glory this week? Thursday's opening round was disrupted by the arrival of predicted bad weather, but there is much more at the Pennsylvania venue to challenge the world's top golfers.
Historic club to host U.S. Open
Tour stars on God and golf
Tour stars on God and golf
CNN's Living Golf has gone behind the scenes at the iconic venue to provide the definitive guide to the magic of Merion and all its charms.
Wicker wonders
Foremost among them are the famous red wicker baskets which are positioned above the pin sticks in place of conventional flags -- a peculiarity these days, though more common earlier in the history of golf.
They first appeared at Merion in 1915, three years after the course opened in September 1912.
The historical origins of the baskets and indeed the reason for them remain unclear, but by the time the 1916 U.S. Amateur Championship was hosted -- the first major event on the course -- they were still in place and have remained ever since.
The green staff even have a special machine into which each individual wicker basket flag can be gathered up each night in the "wicker cart."
When a move to replace "the wickers" with standardized flags was mooted, the outcry was loud and clear.
But, according to Trevino, they add to the challenge facing the golfers, particularly in breezy conditions.
"Generally when we stand out in the middle of the fairway we can see which way the flag is blowing so we have some idea of how to play the wind," he told CNN.
"But with the wicker baskets, no!"
The toughest of five courses at Bethpage State Park on Long Island, Bethpage Black joined the U.S. Open roster in 2002 after the USGA decided to bring its flagship tournament to a public venue. Green fee: $130 weekdays, $150 weekends.
Designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. and opened for play in 2007, this 7,165-yard, par 72 stunner on the shores of Puget Sound hosted the 2010 U.S. Amateur. It will host its first U.S. Open in 2015. Green fee: $219.
Erin Hills hosted the U.S. Amateur in 2011 and will host the U.S. Open in 2017. The 7,823-yard, par 72 course is a walking-only course, with neither motorized nor pull carts allowed. Green fees: $200. Jack Nicklaus said: "If I had only one more round to play, I would choose to play it at Pebble Beach. It's possibly the best in the world." Green fees: $495. Pinehurst No. 2 hosted a PGA Championship in 1936, a Ryder Cup in 1951 and its second U.S. Open in 2005. Next year, it will become the first venue to host a U.S. Open and a U.S. Women's Open in subsequent weeks. Stay-and-play packages from $488.
Tiger Woods won the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines after hobbling his way around the course with a knee injury, then dispatching Rocco Mediate on the first sudden-death playoff hole. Green fee: $183. Bethpage Black Course, New York

U.S. Open courses you can play
A golf coaching dynasty
Golf's billion dollar pioneer Whoever emerges the winner this Sunday evening will be presented with a wicker basket to commemorate their win along with the championship trophy.
One-iron wonder
In 1950, the legendary American golfer Ben Hogan won the U.S. Open at Merion -- just 16 months after suffering terrible injuries in an automobile crash which nearly claimed his life.
By a curious twist, and for the only time, the wicker baskets were not used that year.
Perhaps they did not want to upset Hogan -- who had the unfair reputation of being a ruthless and aloof winning machine -- on his courageous comeback trail.
So when he came to play his second shot to the testing par-four 18th in the final round, he would have seen a flag blowing in the far distance over 200 yards away.
Struggling with pain from his still-healing injuries and knowing he needed to find the small green with his shot to have any real chance of joining two other golfers in a playoff, Hogan selected a one-iron club -- which hits the ball far and low if hit correctly.
Ever the perfectionist, Hogan's strike was pure perfection and brought gasps from the galleries as it arrowed its way to the heart of the green.
Two putts for a par were enough and he won the next day's 18-hole playoff against Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio.
The drama of the moment was captured for posterity by famous Sports Illustrated and Life Magazine photographer Hy Peskin. It is rated one of the best sports photos of the 20th century.
Tiger Woods: I have plenty of time
Faldo to make British Open return
'Lefty' to enter golf's Hall of Fame That club used by Hogan now resides in the U.S. Golf Association Museum as one of its prized exhibits.
Iconic winners
Hogan would be near the top of any list of all-time great golfers, but call it coincidence, the best of the best have filled the honors board at Merion.
The 1916 U.S. Amateur was the first tournament for a 14-year-old Bobby Jones. He returned in 1924 to win the event, but his victory in 1930 is best remembered.
In the days before the U.S. Masters and PGA Championship, the majors were considered to be the U.S. and British Opens and the British and U.S. Amateur Championships.
Jones, the dominant golfer of his era, amateur or professional, arrived at Merion in September 1930 needing to win the U.S. Amateur to complete the set in the same calendar year.
In the 36-hole final, played to a matchplay format, he thrashed his unfortunate opponent Eugene Homans, watched by a massive crowd. A reporter labeled the feat as the "Grand Slam" -- a term which has stuck. It was to prove Jones' final tournament as he retired from competition aged just 28 to practice law, although he was the driving force behind founding the Masters at Augusta.
Olin Dutra won the first U.S. Open to be staged at Merion in 1934, Hogan's 1950 heroics have gone down in golfing folklore, while Nicklaus famously led the United States to victory there in the Eisenhower Trophy (the World Amateur Team Championship) in 1960.
His four-round total of 269 is considered one of the greatest displays in the history of the game, but when Nicklaus returned to Merion for the U.S. Open at the peak of his powers in 1971 he found Trevino barring his way to victory.
They both tied in 280 level par after four rounds on a course Trevino described as holding "a lot of trouble and with a lot of tall grass."
David Graham's 1981 U.S. Open victory
Recreating golf's most iconic photograph
Few gave him much chance in the playoff, but with a round of 68 to Nicklaus' 71 he claimed his second U.S. Open and his words "had beaten the best" giving him the belief he "really belonged" in very elite of golf.
David Graham claimed the fourth staging of U.S Open at Merion in 1980 and was in awe of his place in golfing history, becoming the first Australian to win the tournament.
"Bobby Jones won there, Trevino, Hogan won there and then this little kid from Australia comes along and wins," he told CNN.
Hogan phoned him after his victory and they had lunch. "He liked international players, he congratulated me on winning. It was cool," Graham said.
Anyone for cricket
Coming from Australia, Graham would acknowledge that while golf is a popular sport, cricket is a national obsession as it is in England -- the two battling for supremacy for the famous Ashes.
When the original Merion club was founded in 1865 -- a playground for the rich society elite of Philadelphia -- the British influence was still strong, so cricket was the chosen sport for the country club setting, while tennis also became popular.
In 1896, a golf club was formed from the membership and a course built on existing grounds.
The Merion East Course came later -- completed in 1912 and built on land acquired near Ardmore.
It was designed by one of the club's members, Scotsman Hugh Wilson -- who had never done such a job before.
Scottish roots
He went back home to find inspiration from Scotland's famous coastal links courses, and it was he who introduced the wicker baskets.
North Berwick Golf Course, near the border of England, has a strong resemblance to Merion, particularly the 15th and 17th holes.
The style of the bunkers is also different from that commonly found in the United States and according to Trevino are devilishly difficult. They are nicknamed the "white faces of Merion" and with good reason.
"The Scottish-type bunkers are unbelievable because you think you might be in the bunker, then all of a sudden you're in the lip of it and you can't find your ball, I mean it's hiding in there!" Trevino told CNN.
Trevino believes that despite its short length by modern standards, the combination of the bunkers, small greens and forbidding rough will leave Tiger and co. with a very real test.
"That'll be the toughest little 7,000-yard golf course you'll ever see."
Lunch tee
One of other challenges facing the players will be the unusually close proximity of the dining patio to the first tee.
Nerves jangling at the start of an important round, the players can almost hear the tinkle of cutlery and glasses as the members tuck in to some fine cuisine.
"It almost feels like you're teeing off in a carport because the first tee is just outside the door there," Trevino said.
"That's the way all the courses used to be. If you go over to Scotland and if you shank a ball out of a bunker, then you'll break the biggest window in the world in a dining room.
"That's the way they built it -- they had a lot of property, they didn't waste it. Now you're building golf courses on 500 acres and nine holes covers five miles!"
Merion, hosting the U.S. Open for the fifth time, takes up a mere 120 acres.
All about tradition As Trevino and others have suggested, it is a course absolutely dripping with traditional influence and none more so than the clubhouse, which was once a farmhouse.
Players will use a changing room full of big metal lockers and period features.
Photos and old scorecards adorn the walls and there is a massive trophy case -- appropriate for a club which has hosted more USGA events, 18 in all, than any other in the United States.
The last was the 2009 Walker Cup amateur competition, where the likes of Rickie Fowler helped the United States to victory over Great Britain and Ireland.
Once on the course, players and caddies will have to do without yardage markers, while golf carts are prohibited even for members.
Graham has nothing but praise for the work of the club in preserving its culture and heritage.
"They've done such a superb job with their museum, they're very cognizant of the club's tradition and they do what Augusta National does. At all costs they protect the integrity of the club," the 67-year-old said.
"Certain (U.S.) Opens, like the one at Pebble Beach, is a little special and certainly the Open at Merion was special, especially for me."
Doubtless, whoever writes their name into the roll of honor under 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson will take away similar thoughts and join a list of special greats.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ice and snow storms are crippling some states in the Southeast Ian Roulstone: Predicting how much snow will actually accumulate is difficult He says the physics of snowfall is complex, involving factors like temperature, moisture Roulstone: Making the final call comes down to "seat of the pants" knowledge in the end Editor's note: Ian Roulstone is professor of mathematics at the University of Surrey in England. He is co-author of "Invisible in the Storm: The Role of Mathematics in Understanding Weather" (Princeton University Press).
(CNN) -- A snow-covered landscape is one of the classic images showcasing the beauty of weather on Earth. We are awed by the grandeur of white-capped mountains and the almost magical quality of snow-covered trees. We are also frustrated when the tempests of winter reach far and wide, striking as they have done this year in America's southern states.
When it comes to forecasting the likelihood of a blizzard, the weather anchors know what to say. But when asked to predict how much snow will actually accumulate, they will give estimates. Why?
The computer models used in weather forecasting do not actually predict snow. A single variable is used to predict water in its various forms -- liquid, vapor or ice -- so we need other information, such as air temperature, to decide whether snowfall is likely.
Ian Roulstone
Models forecast the amount of liquid water produced when air rises above the height at which water vapor begins to condense. This is commonly known as the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF). While QPFs are an important ingredient when it comes to predicting snow, there are many other very subtle factors that can easily tip the balance in favor of rain, or make it very difficult to distinguish between different types of snow.
If temperatures are low enough to allow precipitation to fall as snow, then the forecasters need some way to convert the QPF to an equivalent snowfall. The ratio that we use to calculate the liquid water to snow equivalent is around 1 to 10. That is, if the QPF predicts 1 inch of rain, we can anticipate the amount of snow produced would be 10 inches.
Unfortunately, life's not always that simple.
The liquid water to snow ratio can vary depending on whether the snow is "wet" or "dry." Dry snow is the term used to describe small powdery flakes, and it forms when there is very little moisture available. Under these circumstances, the rain to snow ratio can be considerably higher, with values of 1 to 20 not uncommon.
On the other hand, if there is abundant moisture and the snowflakes are larger and wetter, a ratio of 1 to 5 may be typical. Therefore we need to have a very accurate forecast of the levels of moisture in the atmosphere, together with the variation of temperature with altitude, to even get off on the right foot when it comes to predicting snowfall.
Our forecast models represent a snapshot of the weather at any moment in time by using huge arrays of numbers to describe states of the atmosphere. These numbers represent basic variables such as moisture and temperature.
Calculating how these many millions of "weather pixels" will change requires superfast computation and large amounts of memory. The inevitable limitations on available computer power and data storage force a trade-off between the geographical coverage of models and the detail that we can expect from them. This trade-off can be critical when it comes to calculating reliable QPFs.
Forecasters often have to resort to methods they learned at college, involving dew points, temperature soundings from meteorological balloon ascents and real-time reports from weather stations to assess the impact of a snow storm.
The bottom line is that snow -- one of our most loved, and occasionally loathed, features of weather -- is real tough to forecast well.
We may be able to capture the beauty of Mother Nature with high resolution digital images, but capturing the physics behind the snowfall in our sophisticated weather prediction models is much more challenging.
Making the final call comes down to "seat of the pants" knowledge in the end.
