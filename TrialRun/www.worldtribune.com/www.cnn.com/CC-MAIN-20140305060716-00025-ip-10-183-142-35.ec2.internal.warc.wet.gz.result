(CNN) -- During the eight weeks of the New You Resolution program, participants are keeping a journal. Experts recommend journal-keeping in helping to set goals and implement action for change. Below are excerpts from participant Pam Kirkbride's journal from the past week, with the most current at the top.
February 15-19
Exercise: Getting back on track and have scheduled out enough cardio this week and have done my home work-outs so far everyday -- even if they are at 9:30/10:00 at night! It helps when Michael and I do it together. I weighed myself today and on my scale I read 115 pounds. So, I have lost 6 pounds so far. Michael has done fabulous. I think he's lost 17 - 18 lbs. Men have it so easy! But, besides the numbers, I am feeling better. I can see that my stomach muscles have tightened up and I am actually wearing tops that I wasn't able to wear before because my stomach would stick out! I've gotten some comments from co-workers that I've been looking good, which helps keep me going as well!
Food: The hunger pains have subsided, and I feel like I am in a routine with my healthy food choices. It's automatic that I don't get fries, I don't eat fried food, and I choose more vegetables and fruit. Sushi and Japanese food have now become the staple fast food instead of pizza and burgers. Michael and I have found some dessert choices that have actually fulfilled our desire to eat sweets: juice pops and a surprisingly good substitute for chocolate is chocolate yogurt! Yummy, chocolate-y and good for you! We were quite surprised.
I am actually wearing a pair of pants that I bought post-pregnancy and they are now BIG on me! So, I know that I am doing something right. I may not have lost double digit numbers as Michael has (very jealous), but I am definitely back to my pre-baby active ways -- we both are!
Week of February 9
Again, an extremely busy, busy week at work, which really affects my exercise routine.
Exercise: I've only done cardio once this week -- on Monday. Michael started classes up again, so Tuesdays and Wednesdays are my nights with Olivia. Thursday was supposed to be my night at the gym, but just didn't have the energy to go after I came home from work at 7 p.m. I was actually supposed to take off from work on Friday (as part of my Alternate Work Arrangement that I planned through work since Olivia was born) but it was so busy, that I stayed a full day instead. Needless to say, both Thursday and Friday I did not go to the gym even though it was in the schedule. However, after I type this I am headed up to the gym, so that will make my cardio schedule 2 out of 3 this week. I have done Stacey's work-outs 2 times this week so far, so I didn't do so hot in that area either. Will make it up tonight.
Food: Again, I've been really good with the food. I actually went out for lunch one day this week with the sole intention of getting an eggplant parmigiana, and instead came back with a very satisfying salad! We even went to a child's birthday party today and we didn't have cupcakes! That was HUGE for me. They looked really good, though. Ever since New You started, both Michael and I haven't had pizza. I have had some soda (a cup at the birthday party and a ginger ale this week) but mostly its been water or seltzer.
However, just eating healthy doesn't cut it anymore. Lack of exercise and a very busy week has really left me feeling not so great. I wasn't feeling so lean as I had been the past couple of weeks. So, I am hoping that tonight's exercise will help me get back in the groove. The prospect of buying a bathing suit for my postpartum body is hanging over my shoulders, so I REALLY need to do this. Again, I am just so glad that I have Michael supporting me. As I write this, he is putting Olivia to sleep and has made me promise that I go to the gym. I have to keep that promise -- so, I gotta go!
Week of February 2
It was an incredibly rough week, work wise. And it has shown in my workout: I only was able to do cardio once on Saturday. And I left my sneakers at work, so I was only able to do cardio on the recumbent bike -- barefoot. I was exhausted mentally and physically most of the week, and my home workouts suffered as well. I was probably at 50 percent of my home workouts.
However, I have kept my healthy eating habits. I have eaten salads, egg whites, oatmeal, sushi, etc. for lunch -- still not having any desserts. Saturday night, however was my friend's birthday. I kept with the healthy eating: chips (I know, bad) with guacamole (good!); seared tuna steak with grilled pineapple (I did not eat the fried beans) and for dessert (YES! I had dessert!) I had bites (only bites!) of Mexican ice cream, a chocolate cake and an apple tart. I have to say it was pretty good [over] what I would normally have chosen to eat if I wasn't on the New You Resolution.
I have worked out both Saturday and Sunday, however, doing cardio and the home workouts. So, hopefully, I am back on track. I have mixed up my workout a bit, too: doing some Pilates moves I've learned in classes back in the day, using that big workout ball and those balance half-balls for more core work. I've added some light weights as well, just to mix it up a bit.
The eight weeks are closing up soon, and so far, I am proud of what Michael and I have accomplished. We have come light years from where we were a couple of months ago.
January 28
I ate so well today -- which makes up for the fact that I didn't do any of my exercises today. I had my normal healthy breakfast: medium light coffee, oatmeal with milk and a banana. For lunch, I ordered from this health food place called "The Pump" and had grilled chicken with vegetarian chili on top of brown rice. It was a huge portion, so I only ate about half of it, and am planning on having the other half for lunch tomorrow. I was hungry a couple of hours after eating, but powered through it. Like David Peck, I really hope my stomach starts to shrink.
Michael and I have taken the advice of one of the CNN viewers who sent us a supportive e-mail. She said that when in doubt, eat sushi -- so, when we don't have dinner planned and time is short, we order in sushi: low-fat and not too expensive! We do have to get the low-sodium soy sauce, though.
January 26
We got even more organized today. We went to the Container Store and got some shelving for our kitchen. ... Of course now, we have to get a stud finder, so our shelving is still sitting in a bag in the living room. But the bulletin board, magnetic board and swipey calendar that I also got at The Container store have been put up by Michael, so we are fully organized -- and it looks great, too!
Michael made me go to the gym tonight at 8 p.m. -- did my cardio and my home workout. Getting there was really hard, but felt great afterwards. My reward? TV's "Sex and The City."
We've been so good on the food front. We seriously haven't had dessert since we've started the New You Resolution. We were CRAVING chocolate all day, but we helped each other through the cravings. We had chicken and couscous (cooks in 5 minutes!) for dinner tonight and Michael will have leftovers Monday.
January 27
I ate so well today. I had a pretty big breakfast -- but it was healthy: coffee, 2 hard-boiled eggs (ate egg whites only), oatmeal with milk, whole wheat bagel with jelly. Lunch was a chicken fajita, carrots and celery and an apple for a snack. Dinner was more snack-y than a real meal as I went out for my friend's farewell party -- had some bites (and I mean bites) of chicken, mashed sweet potatoes then came home and had some split pea soup.
Michael and I did our home workouts. However, Michael was slated to go to the gym, but couldn't find his sneakers (for real! -- he couldn't find them this morning, either!) Hoping to continue the healthy eating tomorrow.
January 23
My body has healed from my Monday workout, and I am finally able to walk up and down stairs without holding onto the handrail, which means I can get back to the gym! Michael will have Olivia tonight, so I'll be able to do my cardio workout. After he puts her to sleep, we'll do our home workout together. Hopefully we'll get each other inspired to do it at 9 p.m. tonight.
Have a birthday party and a baby shower this weekend, which means my willpower will be tested again with the whole food thing. My biggest challenge is the fact that I never deny myself food. So, I will just have to practice the whole concept of "portion control" -- and allow me to taste things, but not have a huge portion (or seconds!). I'll let you know how it goes after the weekend.
I went to The Container Store yesterday and got some fun bulletin boards, magnet boards and a swipey calendar board to get Team Kirkbride even MORE organized! I can't wait to have Michael put it up so this weekend we can get started!! Next project is getting the kitchen more organized with Elizabeth's "vertical and horizontal" method. All in all, very exciting.
January 22
Some major breakthroughs: I was able to get out of the house this morning in less than 1 minute because I knew where the following were: my keys, my wallet, my metrocard, my purse, my coat, my gloves and my hat. Normally, what would've taken at least 10 minutes of searching through the house, only took literally less than 1 minute. Michael did not have to wait in the hallway for me!
Another was that I was able to take the pile of mail last night that was sitting in our "in" box on our new desk and go through it, pay the bills and recycle all the junk mail -- did that while Olivia was in bed. It was so nice to know that there was one place where I could look for all the bills instead of trying to look for them on the green dresser, on our old desk, on the dining table or on the coffee table!!! Very liberating!!!
January 19
Took [the trainer] Stacey's Willpower and Grace Class -- WHOAH. Totally turned the notch up in my exercise repertoire. The class was HAAARRRDDDD, never worked my body in that way, that hard for a really long time. But, I have to say, that two, three weeks ago, there was no way I would've been able to make it through that class. But now that I have had two weeks under my belt of Stacey's prescription work-out, the strength is coming back -- and I made it through the class. AND -- she weighed me -- 116.5 lbs! Which means I lost 4 pounds! Last Friday, two people at work asked me if I lost weight....AND MOST IMPORTANTLY -- I can feel my strength get back. Its amazing what two weeks can do.
On the food end, both Michael and I have not had dessert in two weeks, which is a huge feat for us. HUGE.
January 13
The fast food gods are testing me. My friend wanted to go to Burger King for lunch. I went, and got a side salad and a cup of their chili. See? You can do fast food without killing yourself! I spoke with my doctor regarding my blood tests and my cholesterol level is high: 224. Pre-pregnancy I was 168. I saw a Quaker Oats commercial that said that if you eat oatmeal for 30 days, it will lower your cholesterol. So, all week, I've been having cereal for breakfast. Hopefully with that, eating healthier and working out, I'll be able to get my cholesterol level down.
I have definitely noticed a significant difference in my strength since working out a week ago. ... The cardio workout that Stacey gave us on the treadmill isn't as daunting as it was a week ago. I still have issues with push-ups. The 20 she has me doing every day are still as hard as they were on that first day.
January 12
Fell off the wagon: went to McDonald's for lunch -- HOWEVER -- I got the cheeseburger kid's meal so they were smaller portions. Therefore, I got my McDonald's fix and I am inoculated for the next 6 months. ... I didn't work out, however, because we still had some organizing to do before experts from "Real Simple" [magazine] come by to do the organization make-over, and since Tuesday is Michael's day to go to the gym, I won't be able to do cardio until Wednesday. I am hoping to get back on track Tuesday night and do my home workout that Stacey gave us to do after I put Olivia to sleep.
The day was pretty good despite all the set-backs. I'd rate it a 7.
January 9 (Pam and Michael together)
Heck of a weekend. On Friday, we were savagely attacked by the [consultants from] Real Simple magazine, who came up with great ideas for our apartment that will make the place much more "user-friendly" in the long term, but required non-stop homework all weekend long.
Being organized requires getting organized. So Pam spent about 24 of the 48
weekend hours going through files and consolidating closets (even bought a paper shredder!) and generally tearing down so that our new friends from Real Simple
can build back up. In the meantime, Michael took care of the littlest Kirkbride all weekend long. Truly a tag team.
That said, we did all of our workout yesterday ... we both did the full 40 minutes and
gradations on the treadmill as well as our daily stuff. ... Today, however, there's just been no time because of all the prep work for Real Simple. And now we're both bone tired and need to sleep or else we'll start the week off all wrong.
[We] miss dessert. Michael longs desperately for a pint of Ben & Jerry's Phish Food, and Pam just craves chocolate cake, brownies and/or cookies all day. Going to bed unsatisfied --- and, no, meringue cookies just aren't gonna cut it.
We both feel "mid-project" at this point, especially on the home organization front. Pam put in so much time this weekend, it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel (she even missed the second episode of Sex and the City!). But this week, the Real Simple folks will come in and put it all back together better than it ever was, and we're really excited about that.
On the exercising end: working out for a week and Pam already feels great -- she can definitely feel her strength increasing ... All the exercises that [the trainer] showed us are all feeling like that they are do-able now, instead of this huge obstacle.
Michael feels overwhelmed by the constant demand because of the daily requirements, but overall feels great being back at the gym and sweating again.
Workouts, too are getting easier. We both are still feeling the time crunch. It would be nice to be able to just relax one of these days instead of running around and "doing" things....
January 7
My treat today was being able to read a magazine (a treat for me!) while I was on the treadmill for 40 minutes. Reading a magazine is such a rarity these days that that will be my treat to myself whenever I go to the gym and do cardio. The fact that I even made it to the gym being all tired and anticipating Olivia's nighttime madness was a huge accomplishment. Michael was and always is a huge support and cheerleader.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the day as a 7.
January 6
Unfortunately , for dinner, Michael and I had no time to make dinner since we only had about 45 minutes with the baby so we had pizza for dinner -- but instead of drinking soda, we had water.
My biggest accomplishment today was sticking to a healthy meal plan for lunch and breakfast and for doing my exercises -- even if they were at 9 p.m.!
Most of the day I felt a little overwhelmed at work -- I was really tired from the New You's kick off festivities [the night before]. I just felt like I couldn't concentrate at work so I hardly got anything done. I wasn't focused enough at work. But hopefully eating well today and sleeping well tonight will make a better work day tomorrow.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the day as a 5.

Some doubt hand washing stops H1N1Story Highlights Hand washing can reduce risk of catching a cold; not as helpful against H1N1 H1N1 virus not stable on hand; instead it thrives in droplets of water Inhaling airborne particles, from cough or sneeze, results in a bigger dose of virus Regardless, washing hands "really is wonderful" for preventing many diseases Next Article in Health » Read VIDEO By Elizabeth Cohen CNN Senior Medical Correspondent	(CNN) -- At the beginning of the school year, a couple of hundred parents, myself included, gathered in the middle school lounge for the principal's back-to-school speech. The chatting hushed as the principal walked from the back of the room to the podium. As she proceeded down the aisle, parting the crowd of parents, she carried with her the biggest bottle of hand sanitizer I've ever seen. Expert: Washing hands works well to prevent many diseases, but it's not very helpful agains the flu virus. When she arrived at the front of the room, the principal, all 5 feet and 100 pounds of her, used every bit of her strength to hoist the giant jug onto the lectern. "Welcome back to school," she said. "Swine flu stops here." The principal explained that between each and every class, the teachers would supervise the children while they sanitized their hands. In addition, students would be washing and sanitizing their hands at other times, such as before lunch and snack. My eldest daughter confirmed that they really were cleaning their hands at least every 45 minutes, but exactly eight days later, the e-mails started to arrive: a case of suspected H1N1 flu in the seventh grade, another in kindergarten, and then another and another. At one point at my daughters' school, they were sending home a dozen students a day sick with symptoms of H1N1 flu. A sneeze in the theater versus a germy handshake What happened here? How come with all that hand washing so many children still became ill? According to some experts, you can wash your hands all you want, and it won't do much to stop the spread of influenza, including the H1N1 variety. Don't Miss H1N1 -- Fighting Swine Flu
In Depth: Empowered Patient
"Washing hands really is wonderful for preventing many diseases, such as the common cold, but it's not very helpful to prevent influenza," said Arthur Reingold, professor of epidemiology at the University of California-Berkeley. I gave Reingold two scenarios. The first: I'm sitting in a movie theater next to -- but not touching -- someone with H1N1, and he sneezes and doesn't cover his mouth. The second: Someone with H1N1 rubs his nose, shakes my hand, and then I rub my nose. In which situation am I more likely to catch the flu? That's easy, said Reingold, an infectious disease specialist who advises on vaccine policy for the World Health Organization. The theater incident is much more likely -- much, much more likely, he said -- to give me the flu, since inhaling particles results in a bigger dose of the virus. A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees there isn't strong evidence that hand washing fights H1N1. "We don't have solid data on the effect that hand washing has on the transmission of H1N1," CDC spokesman Tom Skinner wrote in an e-mail. But he said there's still reason to be vigilant about hand washing. "There are studies that show hand washing was effective in reducing transmission of other respiratory diseases," he said. Dr. Peter Palese, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, said hand washing isn't all that helpful against the flu because the flu isn't like other respiratory diseases. "The flu virus isn't very stable on the hand," he said. "The virus has a lipid membrane that flattens out when it's on your hand, and it gets inactivated." The rhinovirus, on the other hand, which causes the common cold, can live quite nicely on someone's hand. "It has a different architecture than a flu virus," he said. "It's much more stable." The flu virus thrives in droplets of water, such as the kind that come out of your mouth when you sneeze or cough. "The lipid membrane stays intact when it's surrounded by a droplet of water that's ten times bigger than the virus itself," Palese says. Infectious disease experts and the CDC agree the flu is more likely to be transmitted through airborne particles than through hand contact. However, they disagreed on the extent to which flu is caused by hand contact compared with inhalation of particles. Mark Nicas, an adjunct professor at the University of California-Berkeley School of Public Health, thinks a significant number of flu cases do indeed spread from hands touching one another. "I think that hand contact accounts for maybe one-third of influenza infections," he said. Hand washing: A false sense of security from H1N1? Some infectious disease experts said they're concerned messages from the CDC to wash hands to prevent H1N1 have given people too much faith in hand washing. "Everyone's eager to promote hand washing, and certainly it won't do any harm, but to rely on a hand washing as a way to prevent influenza is a serious mistake," said Reingold. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Hand washing -- An easy way to prevent infection MayoClinic.com: Swine Flu
"Don't kid yourself that you're going to protect yourself from the flu completely by washing your hands," said Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The CDC has emphasized other prevention techniques, such as vaccination, as well, Skinner said. "CDC has communicated from the get-go that hand washing is only one tool in the toolbox used to prevent the transmission of influenza," he said. This brings me back to my experience at my daughters' school. The e-mails from the principal said some of the sick children reported to the school nurse that they'd woken up ill, but their parents sent them to school anyway. What's up with that? If your child is sick, keep her at home. If you're sick, don't go to work. Using that particular tool in the toolbox will go a long way toward stemming the spread of H1N1 flu -- probably more than washing your hands.

Pentagon report: China extending military reachBy Adam Levine, CNN A report says the expansion of China's military capabilities is meant to offer "extended-range power projection." STORY HIGHLIGHTSA Pentagon report on China's military cites the U.S. military's concernsChina has the most active ballistic and cruise missile program in the worldChina could start building its first aircraft carrier this yearBut China's ability to sustain military power at a distance remains limited for now
RELATED TOPICS
U.S. Department of Defense
China
Washington (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to expand its reach and capabilities beyond its immediate geographical area, a new report from the U.S. Department of Defense concludes. The report, an annual assessment sent to Congress, notes that some of those capabilities have been positive, like humanitarian and anti-piracy efforts, but others are meant to give China "extended-range power projection." While China's continued effort to be able to sustain military operations far from its shore are concerning to the U.S. military, "China's ability to sustain military power at a distance, today, remains limited," the report says. As in the past, the U.S. program to sell military equipment to Taiwan continues to create tension with China and has led to cessation at times of military relations between the two countries. The assessment notes that China has the most active ballistic and cruise missile program in the world, including developing anti-missile technology. Also of concern are Chinese efforts to develop a long-range anti-ship ballistic missile with a reach of more than 900 miles, which would include areas in which the U.S. Navy is active. Such a measure would give the Chinese military "the capability to attack ships, including aircraft carriers, in the Western Pacific Ocean," according to the report. The Chinese could start building their first aircraft carrier this year, and China has started to train pilots to operate off such carriers. It already has a Russian carrier that it is refurbishing. Its naval muscle is also being flexed with additional nuclear powered submarines, and it has nearly completed a navy base on Hainan Island, "with direct access to vital international sea lanes," which will allow for "stealthy deployment of submarines," the report says.

Original Green Lantern comes out as gay in DC Comics' 'Earth Two'
By Matthew Perpetua, Rolling Stone
updated 2:03 PM EDT, Fri June 1, 2012
In DC Comics' "Earth Two" issue two, Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern, is reintroduced as a gay man.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
DC Comics' "Earth Two" issue two shows Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern, as an openly gay man
"He doesn't come out in issue two; he is already a gay man," writer James Robinson says
Scott's sexuality is revealed to the reader in a decidedly matter-of-fact sort of way
(Rolling Stone) -- When DC Comics relaunched its fictional world from scratch last fall, some aspects of the DC mythos temporarily fell by the wayside, such as the notion of parallel worlds featuring different versions of the company's iconic heroes.
"Earth Two," a new series by writer James Robinson and artist Nicola Scott, reintroduces the concept by putting a new spin on the original versions of characters like the Green Lantern, the Flash and Superman that diverges notably from the past several decades of DC lore. In the second issue of the comic, in stores June 6, Robinson and Scott prove just how different this world is by revealing that their version of Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern introduced back in 1940, is an openly gay man.
Up until recently, a middle aged version of Alan Scott was one of the stars of "Justice Society of America," a comic series featuring the 1940s versions of DC's heroes set in the present day. The new versions of these characters in Earth Two have all been aged down considerably, to the point that Scott's gay superhero son Obsidian had to be sacrificed. Robinson says he was inspired to write Scott himself as a gay character to make up for that loss. "The logical leap that I made was, oh, why don't we make Alan Scott gay?," he says. "To DC's credit, there wasn't any hesitation. [Co-publisher] Dan DiDio was like 'Oh, that's a great idea, let's do it!'"
Robinson's version of Green Lantern differs from his counterpart in the regular DC Universe in ways other than his sexual orientation. "He has a ring which he uses to help manifest his powers, but he doesn't have a lantern," he says, noting that the mainstream Green Lanterns are members of a corp of space police who draw their energy directly from their own willpower. "He is the receptacle, the conduit for the energy of the Earth, which is this green energy." Unlike previous versions of Scott dating back to the Forties, wood will not be a weakness for the new Green Lantern. "He is the earthly powerhouse, and when you see him in terms of his power level, he's up there close to Superman."
Though Marvel Comics' gay hero Northstar is set to face some intolerance from his peers following his marriage to his long term boyfriend in the pages of "Astonishing X-Men," Robinson and Scott are planning on portraying an idealized world in which Alan Scott is judged only by the quality of his character.
"He doesn't come out in issue two; he is already a gay man," Robinson says. "Alan Scott is super-heroic, he's super gallant, he'll die for the earth, he'll die for its people, he's everything you want in a hero. I imagine he's such a Type A character that when he realized he was gay, he was like, 'Okay, I'm gay, now I'm just gonna go on with my life.' He's so accepting of it himself and he's such a compelling person that the world knows Alan Scott's gay. He's such a leader, he's such a good man, that the Justice League don't care. And that's a healthy depiction of a team and how it should be."
Scott says her instructions from Robinson were to make this version of the Green Lantern as heroic as possible.
"With Alan, the brief was very clear," she says. "He needed to be a big, strapping, handsome man that everyone would instinctively follow and love. Alan strikes me as an incredibly open, honest and warm man, a natural leader and absolutely the right choice to be Guardian of the Earth. His sexuality is incidental."
You can click through to check out a preview of "Earth Two" issue two, in which Alan Scott's sexuality is revealed to the reader in a decidedly matter-of-fact sort of way.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Four U.S. personnel, including ambassador, are killed in Libya, the U.S. says
Angry protesters attack U.S. diplomatic compounds in Egypt and Libya
Obama says the U.S. is working to protect its citizens worldwide
Cairo (CNN) -- The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt Tuesday.
In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to halt ground attacks from then-Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said.
The U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, was killed in the attack, the State Department said. Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and two other U.S. personnel also died in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement Wednesday.
"Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues," Clinton said.
"All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future," she added.
In an earlier statement, Clinton said she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities "in the strongest terms" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was "working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide."
Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack in Benghazi, saying it "led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals." Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating.
Middle East attacks against U.S.
It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night.
Protesters storm U.S. embassy walls
"One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?" she asked.
In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene.
Police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound.
The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, "There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger," an emblem often used by Islamic radicals.
A volley of warning shots were fired as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots.
Are you there? Share your images and videos. Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie.
In a series of disjointed scenes, filmmakers depict Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer.
The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him.
Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported.
Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive.
"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet," Clinton said. "The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation."
But she stressed that "there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."
Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which "may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior."
"It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another," the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. "Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon."
Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans.
An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day, ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in.
"This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult," said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. "But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control."
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy.
"There are police forces at the demonstrations," El Naggary said. "They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave."
Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel.
Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri -- added, "We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement."
"We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans," he said. "I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?"
He added that "the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable."
The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday.
It also said in a statement that it "condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions."
"Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy," the statement said. "We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others."
But the U.S. Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, suggested that the embassy's statement had its priorities wrong.
"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks," Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday.
He said he was "outraged" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt.
Obama released a strongly worded statement Wednesday, condemning what he called the "outrageous attack" on the Benghazi compound that took the lives of four Americans.
"They exemplified America's commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously took their lives," the president said.
Obama also announced that he has ordered his administration "to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in Libya, and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe.
"While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants," he added.
Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011.
Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes.
"These protests are a bad image for Egypt," said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. "Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems."
"All I want for Egypt is security and stability," he said. "And as you can see this isn't it."
The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead.
Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker, which then sought to portray Islam as a violent religion.
Geert Wilders' film "Fitna," which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

Single mom fought alongside combat troops in Afghanistan
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 8:10 AM EST, Fri January 25, 2013
Kimberly Bratic, 39, served alongside the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Afghanistan. In six months she went on 70 missions.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
An unemployed single mom with bills to pay decides to enlist in the Army
In Afghanistan, Kimberly Bratic worked with a combat team
One of her three sons struggled with her decision to leave
She just got home to Ohio and still cannot find a job
(CNN) -- Kimberly Bratic hauled her gear up Afghan mountains. She went into areas where Taliban lived. She grieved when fellow soldiers were blown up by a suicide bomber. She missed her family for a year, and heard the worry in her sons' voices when she got the rare chance to call home.
She lay awake, thinking, "What if I don't make it home?"
The only difference between the 39-year-old single mom and the men she went on 70 missions with was their job titles.
U.S. lifts ban on women in combat
The guys were combat infantry. She was a public affairs specialist, the person who documented their experience training Afghan military and police.
Policy change allows women in combat Pentagon ends ban on women in combat
Politics behind women in combat
Veterans debate women in combat roles
"I don't think the enemy would really know the difference if he decided to shoot," she wrote in a CNN iReport.
On Thursday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that the Pentagon was doing a 180 on its long-standing policy against putting women in combat roles. The branches have until mid-May to come up with a plan to implement the historic and controversial change in the next couple years.
"Mr. Panetta's decision is just unchecking a box," Bratic told CNN. "Because we're already out there and just as likely to get shot up."
She understands that men and women have different strengths and many women won't be able to endure the physical demands of training for combat positions.
Former troops say time has come for women in combat units
But she's worked with several women, including female Afghan soldiers, who definitely could.
"They want it? Give them the chance to go for it," she said.
That is all the sergeant wanted when she enlisted two and a half years ago.
Despite having a master's degree in operations management and a bachelor's degree in human resource management, Bratic was struggling to find a job in northwest Ohio.
Rent was due, the bills were piling up and she had three sons to feed.
Then one evening a friend off-handedly said that she should think about the Army.
With her education, she could likely enlist as an officer, he told her.
"I thought, 'No way, not me," Bratic recalled. "But I went online and started reading all these articles and blogs about Uncle Sam wants you."
She looked up what she might potentially earn -- $3,000 a month, including hazard pay in a war zone.
"It started making sense," she said.
But convincing herself wasn't really the problem.
Letting mom go to Afghanistan
Bratic was the kind of mother who always talked reality with her sons, then 9, 10 and 18.
They hated that their mother was often gone, juggling a couple low-paying part-time jobs, including being an adjunct professor.
"They knew I was trying to pay bills," she said. "It was hard for them. They just wanted me to come home and have family time and I just couldn't."
So she sat them down and together they looked at the websites of the National Guard and the Navy.
They just played around a bit, watched the slick videos that look so cool.
She told them what she wanted to do.
"My oldest, who was starting to think about taking care of himself, understood it," Bratic said. "But the two little ones, they were worried. My middle one had the hardest time. He was the most fearful."
The 10-year-old, Cresston, watched the news. He knew what it meant when Americans in uniform went to Iraq and Afghanistan.
By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military
But what could he do? What could the brothers really say? Mom was going to do what she felt she had to.
And if she went away, even if it was a long time, maybe afterward she would have money and they could spend more time together.
Bratic called her ex-husband. The boys' father didn't like the idea, but he was a good dad. He agreed to care for them while she was gone.
Being in a foreign country at war is frightening. Being afraid you could die is haunting. But being away from your children in that environment is uniquely anguishing.
"That mom side of you ... I couldn't look at Afghan kids. I just shut it off. You'll tear yourself up thinking about your kids," she said. "Your head has to be in the mission."
She was definitely focused.
In the span of six months, she went on 70 missions, assigned to the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. She worked closely with Brig. Gen. Abdul Habib Sayed Khail. It was the infantry's job to help train Afghan troops so that they can secure Afghanistan when the United States draws down its troops.
Bratic said her role was not only to photograph what was happening but also to serve as a mentor the Afghans, including female American and Afghan police and service members.
She also mentored Lt. Abdul Mohammed, her male Afghan public affairs counterpart.
"I felt like there was a lot of respect for me," she said. "I was older and that probably helped. But I respected them. I was a guest in their country, and my guys, the group I was with, established up front that I was to be respected."
But Bratic was constantly aware and alert, knowing about the increasing problem of "green-on-blue" attacks in which Afghans have turned their guns on their U.S. trainers and fellow Afghan soldiers.
She neither played up nor played down her gender.
"The Army is 14% female so I'm already outnumbered," she said. "You just don't think about the guys you're around as eye candy or potential husbands. But you still take care of yourself. I put my hair back every day. I wore Chapstick because my lips would get so dry. And I put eyeliner on because I look deadly without eyeliner."
A uniformed woman in Taliban country
Bratic recalls a favorite mission in Khawajah Bahawuddin in the northeastern region of Badakhshan. The area had not seen NATO forces for years, and no women.
"The potential for disaster was high. We had intel that Taliban were in the area. I had no idea how the people there would react. When we got there, everybody was eyeballing me. I was the woman, the oddity."
The plan was to be there for a while. Gen. Habib took them to a shrine to Ahmad Shah Massoud. A key political and military leader in the Afghans' fight against the Russians in the 1980s, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan. If he had not been assassinated on September 9, 2001, some believe he would have gone on to find Osama bin Laden and help the United States and its allies in a way that no one else could.
While she stood there, holding her camera, Habib told her how Massoud was killed.
His attackers pretended to be journalists doing an interview. Their camera was a bomb.
Bratic thinks about that day when people ask her why she went to Afghanistan. It started out as a way to make money, but it became about more. She is like every soldier, regardless of gender, who is changed by a war and hopes that their families get that.
When she returned to Ohio, her boys ran to her. They embraced their mom. Her son Cresston, though, needs her attention right now. He doesn't want her to leave again, and she opted to be inactive for now, with the Army Reserve. But she wants to go back badly.
Unlike many of the younger soldiers who served with her who banked their earnings, she had to constantly send money back home to pay the bills.
She's afloat for now, living again in Ohio. She spends some of her time blogging about her military experience at Afghanbattlefox.com. But mostly she's sending out resumes and making phone calls. She's still had no luck finding a job.

Are ads ruining baseball on the radio?
By Bob Greene, CNN Contributor
updated 7:13 AM EDT, Mon August 26, 2013
Chicago Cubs baseball announcer Harry Caray conducts fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" from his television booth in 1996
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bob Greene: Baseball radio play-by-play is working commercials into the announcers' descriptions
He says baseball on the radio is still special -- it's free and comforting commentary in summer
At times, play-by-play can reach heights, as in description of Stan Musial's last at bat, Greene says
Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story"; "When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams"; and "Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen." (CNN) -- Baseball. The radio. Summer.
There is something about the connection between the three of them that nothing can tear apart.
If baseball on the radio sounds a little different lately, there is a reason. Richard Sandomir of The New York Times reported recently on the proliferation of "drop-in" advertisements on radio broadcasts of ballgames around the nation.
Bob Greene
Drop-in ads are paid commercials that air not as traditional advertisements, but as part of the play-by-play. The first walk during a New York Yankees game is accompanied by "Just walk into CityMD's six convenient locations"; the first run scored in a Texas Rangers game is described by the play-by-play man as "the First Financial First Run."
It shouldn't be surprising that this is happening. Baseball has always been a relentlessly and unapologetically revenue-seeking enterprise. Have you ever seen photos of the outfield walls in big-league ballparks in the early to mid-20th century? Even NASCAR's marketing strategists would have been envious of the don't-waste-an-inch commercial clutter.
Broadcast entities have to find a way to make back the money they spend for radio rights. According to USA Today the average salary of a Major League Baseball player this year -- the average salary -- is around $3.6 million, and everything from ticket fees to concession-stand prices is reflective of the sport's runaway inflation.
The future of America's favorite pastime
'Voice of baseball' to stay with Dodgers
Baseball instant replay: A good idea?
So no one should be startled by the presence of the drop-in radio ads. Yes, they frequently can be an irritant to the flow of the play-by-play. But ours is a sponsor-and-advertising-driven culture overall; that's not going to go away.
And baseball on the radio -- distinct even from baseball itself -- is durable and steady in ways that can't be easily spoiled. Baseball on the radio is one part of the sport that somehow, despite everything, still manages to feel good.
On the radio, baseball is less literal than baseball on television. With the measured voices of the most skilled announcers accompanied by the resonant humming undertone of the crowd, the echo from down on the diamond of the crack of a bat against a fastball, and the occasional thump of a foul ball bouncing off the top of the play-by-play booth, there is a kind of romance in a radio broadcast.
The sports-page and sports-website coverage of the business of baseball may, of necessity, be dismaying and ugly lately. A visit to the ballpark in person brings on the sticker-shock of those prices on everything from hot dogs to souvenirs to parking spots.
Baseball on the radio, though, remains free. Unlike viewers of cable TV or subscribers to satellite radio, fans of home-team games on their hometown radio stations don't have to pay a cent to listen. The sound of it all is very much what the sound has been forever. Because the pace of the game is leisurely, local play-by-play announcers, over a 162-game season, develop a relationship with their listeners unique in sports. They have to talk a lot, even when there's not much going on down on the field, and the audience grows accustomed to, and comfortable with, their relaxed voices and their heard-but-not-seen personalities.
And that's just during routine games. At certain moments, radio broadcasts of ballgames can become part of the very fabric of a town -- the authentication of how sports can help define the meaning of community.
How good can it get? For a gold-standard example from the history of the sport and of the medium, listen to the KMOX radio broadcast of Stan Musial's final at-bat for the St. Louis Cardinals before his retirement.
The date was September 29, 1963, at the old Busch Stadium in St. Louis. On the play-by-play was Harry Caray, in the years before he moved to Chicago to broadcast the White Sox and then the Cubs. Some older residents of St. Louis recall a television simulcast of Caray's call, but it is the KMOX radio version that is indelible in their memories:
"Here's Musial. Listen to the crowd again." (The roar is heard behind Caray's voice.) "A base hit would give the Cardinals the lead." (The noise sustains.) "First pitch. Oh, what a cut he had, and he fouled it back. Hey, he really had a swing at that one." (The crowd begins to clap rhythmically in unison.) ..."The stretch by Maloney. Low curve."
And then, unforgettably, from Caray: "Take a good look, fans. ... Take a good look. This might be the last time at bat in the major leagues. Remember the stance ... and the swing." (The rhythmic clapping in the stands grows more insistent.) "You're not likely to see his likes again."
The procession of the game: "Fast ball, low and away." And soon: "The pitch to Musial." (Caray's voice rises to be heard above the mounting crowd noise.) "A hot shot on the ground into right field, a base hit! ...The Cardinals lead, one to nothing, listen to the crowd! Listen to the crowd! Let's see, now! Manager Johnny Keane is talking to Gary Kolb.
"Stan is at first base. He might be waiting for this applause on the hit to die down. ... They'll tear the joint apart when he trots off the field. ... Now listen. Gary Kolb is going to replace Musial. ...There he goes! The end of a great career. A standing ovation for Musial. ..."
Could being in the stands have been any more memorable than listening to that?
I remember talking once with a woman in her 80s. She was residing in an assisted-living facility; her husband had died the year before, and the end of their lifetime of long conversations in the evenings had left a void.
She told me that, even though she had never been much of a baseball fan, she found herself tuning in, each evening, to the strong-signal WLW Radio out of Cincinnati. For three hours, she said, she would listen to Marty Brennaman and Joe Nuxhall broadcast the Reds' games. Their voices -- reliable, unhurried -- became her companions. A part of life she could count on.
"Take a good look, fans. ... Take a good look."
It's possible, on summer nights, to see most clearly with your eyes closed.

JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel deployed four U.S.-made Patriot missile batteries in its southern Negev desert on Monday, apparently as a precautionary measure in light of the current standoff between Iraq and the United Nations.
, designed to take out incoming missiles, were rushed to Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, during which Iraq fired dozens of Scud missiles into the country.
The new, improved Patriot batteries were deployed on a hill overlooking the southern town of Arad, near Dimona, the site of a nuclear reactor that reportedly was a target of Iraqi Scuds in 1991.
Israel, at the urging of the United States, refrained from striking back at Iraq during the Gulf War, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Iraq must take into account that Israel had the means to respond to any attack.
And this time, Netanyahu has said, "Israel, and Israel alone, will decide what its response will be."
"We are facing difficult days. I think that what's happening today in the Persian Gulf is a perfect reminder of the kind of neighborhood we live in," Netanyahu told high school students Monday.
"We have the ability to respond and to deter attacks and each side must take this into account," he said. Senior Israeli army officials also said they would expect timely warning from the United States, should Washington decide to launch a military strike against Iraq.
"I'm sure we'll be informed of any attack and any changes in the Gulf area," Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told CNN.
Iraq has not threatened Israel in the latest crisis but a poll published in an Israeli newspaper on Monday said most Israelis thought Iraq would be willing to strike again.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Jerusalem on Sunday that Washington's response would be "swift and forceful" if Iraq attacked Israel or other countries in the region. Jerusalem Bureau Chief Walter Rodgers and Reuters contributed to this report.
