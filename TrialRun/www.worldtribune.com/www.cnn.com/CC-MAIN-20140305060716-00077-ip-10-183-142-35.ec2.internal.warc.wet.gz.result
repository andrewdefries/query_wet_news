Raising money higher priority for McCain than picking running mateStory Highlights Sources: McCain operation reaching out to about 300 major GOP fundraisers Top fundraisers for President Bush's political organization also being courted Target: donors who may have given maximum to first choice, haven't given to McCain Sources say there have been casual conversations about a VP search process Next Article in Politics » By John King CNN Washington Bureau WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Raising money and thinking about a running mate are two of the big challenges facing likely Republican presidential nominee John McCain. Sen. John McCain's team will move to a campaign focused more on Democrats and the general election. Both are on the agenda as the McCain team plans a transition to a campaign focused more on the Democrats and the general election. But one -- fundraising -- is being treated with considerably more urgency. Sources involved in the effort say the McCain fundraising operation is reaching out to some 300 major Republican fundraisers, many of whom were supporting other GOP presidential candidates. McCain is CNN's Larry King's guest for the entire hour tonight at 9 p.m. ET. Also on the list are top fundraisers for President Bush's political organization. Top Bush fundraiser Mercer Reynolds, for example, endorsed McCain this past week, and campaign aides say he's actively helping to expand McCain's financial network. The goal is to raise millions -- tens of millions -- by tapping these fundraising networks and finding donors who may have given the maximum amount to their first choice in the GOP field but have yet to give to McCain. It's an effort proceeding on two tracks: raising millions for the "primary" campaign that continues up to the nominating convention this summer, while also beginning to amass millions more for the general election campaign. Meanwhile, sources inside and close to the McCain camp acknowledge some casual conversations about a vice presidential search process. These sources stress emphatically that there have been no official meetings or discussions with McCain or even among his senior staff, though they expect the subject to come up in a series of transition meetings over the next several days and weeks. "It is a top concern of the media and a relatively low concern of ours," one senior McCain adviser said. One reason for the lack of urgency: While McCain is the all-but-certain GOP nominee, the Democratic race is anything but clear -- and McCain is unlikely to make his pick until after the Democratic nominee chooses a running mate. The Republican convention is a week after the Democrats', and while GOP sources don't rule out a McCain choice earlier, they say that under no circumstances would McCain pick a running mate without first knowing who would lead the Democratic ticket. Don't Miss GOP leaders call Republican race for McCain

McCain sweeps Potomac primaries; conservatives still cool
Still, there are informal conversations about how to begin a search process. Again, the sources said no decisions have been made. But several McCain aides and advisers who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity suggest a logical choice to shepherd the process, at least at the beginning, is McCain adviser and veteran GOP strategist Charlie Black. In a brief conversation with CNN, Black said the subject has not come up in any of his conversations with McCain or campaign manager Rick Davis. Others have suggested Davis would lead the process, though most in the campaign suggest he is too busy with day-to-day challenges, including expanding the staff to prepare for a national campaign, thinking ahead to the GOP convention and preparing for conversations with the Republican National Committee about installing a number of McCain operatives in the party's staff structure. Those who discussed the running mate issue said that for now, the goal would be, as one put it, "to come up with a list of 20 or 25 people as your starting point and begin the basic research and early vetting." So what does McCain need to do with his choice? "Try back in June or July," one campaign official said with a laugh. But GOP circles, of course, are full of such conversations. Some suggest former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's continued strong showing among social conservatives suggests McCain needs to shore up his right flank. Others say his choice will matter more than most vice presidential picks because McCain is 71 years old, so there will even more than the traditional scrutiny of whether the pick is up to being president.

Days of flooding, landslides kill 186 in Philippines Story Highlights 186 people dead in provinces, including Baguio City, Benguet and Mountain Floods were unleased by tropical depression Parma Report: Worst-hit areas in Pangasinan province are Bayambang, Alcala and Basista Next Article in World » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- Flooding and landslides from tropical depression Parma have killed 186 people in the Philippines, authorities said Saturday. Frightened San Manuel villagers flee after rumors spread that nearby San Roque dam is in danger of collapse. Another 93 people have been injured, according to Nalia Tabliago of the Philippines National Disaster Coordinating Council. Rescuers are searching for 40 people reported missing, Tabliago said. Tropical depression Parma, known locally as Pepeng, dumped as much as 36 inches of rain in some parts of the nation of islands last week, compounding misery in areas already flooded by an earlier storm, typhoon Ketsana On Friday, landslides blocked traffic along the Marchos Highway, Naguilian Road, Kennon Road and Ambuklao Road, cutting access to Baguio City, Benguet Province and Mountain Province, according to the Office of Civil Defense in Cordillera. Earlier reports from Rocky Baraan, provincial administrator of Pangasinan, said flooding had inundated 32 towns and two cities, Dagupan and Urdaneta. Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council. The worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported. People clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help. Rescue trucks were hampered by floodwaters that reach the roofs of single-story houses, Baraan said. About 16 rubber rescue boats had been deployed. Since the rains started in central Luzon, three dams in the Pangasinan area have been releasing vast amounts of water -- up to 10 million cubic meters an hour at one dam, officials said.

ACLU: Facebook password isn't your boss' business
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 5:54 PM EDT, Thu March 22, 2012 | Filed under: Social Media
The American Civil Liberties Union objects to businesses asking job applicants for their Facebook passwords.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some employers are asking for Facebook passwords from job applicants
ACLU says the practice, used to screen candidates, is an invasion of privacy
A corrections officer says an interviewer logged into his account to check for gang ties
Maryland and Illinois are among the states considering laws banning the practice
(CNN) -- Your Facebook password is none of your new boss' business.
That's what the American Civil Liberties Union is saying after reports that employers are increasingly asking for access to job applicants' social-media accounts.
"It's an invasion of privacy for private employers to insist on looking at people's private Facebook pages as a condition of employment or consideration in an application process," attorney Catherine Crump said in a statement from the ACLU. "People are entitled to their private lives."
Recently, multiple cases have come to light in which companies have either asked for passwords to Facebook or required that applicants "friend" people at those companies.
Employers asking for Facebook passwords
Robert Collins of the Baltimore area has said that he was looking to be reinstated to his job as a correctional officer in 2010 when he was asked for his Facebook password.
"I did not want to do it, but because I really needed my job and he implied that this was a condition of recertification, I reluctantly gave him the password," Collins said in February in testimony before the Maryland House of Representatives, which is considering ACLU-backed legislation to block such practices.
"He then proceeded to log in to my account using my private credentials. I asked him, 'Why are you logging on?' He said, 'I am looking through your messages, on your wall and in your photos to make sure you are not a gang member or have any gang affiliation.' "
An Associated Press report this week highlighted Justin Bassett, a New York statistician who said that, during a job interview, the interviewer pulled up his Facebook page and asked for his password. He said he refused.
The ACLU said it's found an increasing number of companies with such policies on Facebook. They say it's more common with public agencies, such as law enforcement.
"You'd be appalled if your employer insisted on opening up your postal mail to see if there was anything of interest inside," Crump said. "It's equally out of bounds for an employer to go on a fishing expedition through a person's private social media account."
On an ACLU Facebook page Thursday, followers were, not surprisingly, overwhelmingly against the concept.
"I consider it a violation of personal privacy," one user wrote. "Will the next step be to request a key to my house?"
It is technically against Facebook's Terms of Service to share a password.
"You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account," the agreement reads.
In addition to Maryland, lawmakers in Illinois are considering legislation that would ban the practice.

Ex-Afghan prisoner claims Bagram abuse
By Anna Coren, CNN
updated 7:24 AM EDT, Tue September 25, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Nasim says he was a farmer when police arrested him in 2002 and took him to Bagram prison
He says he is innocent; U.S. records say he was in possession of rocket motors
He claims he was tortured at the prison: "I was hung from the ceiling for seven days"
Nasim says the Americans and international forces need to get out of Afghanistan
Kabul (CNN) -- On a hill overlooking the dusty, sprawling city of Kabul is a park where kids fly their kites. A dirty, beaten up Toyota sedan arrives, and Mohammad Nasim steps out wearing traditional Afghan garb -- a perahan tunban (tunic and pants) and a lungee (a headdress).
He's traveled more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) from his home in Nangarhar province near the Pakistani border, a drive that has taken him at least five hours because the roads are so bad. He wants to tell his story after learning of the decision to transfer Bagram prison from U.S. to Afghan control.
It's a story that began almost a decade ago, a year after the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States by al Qaeda terrorists then based in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, radical islamic fundamentalists dislodged from power by the U.S.-led war against terror that followed.
"At the beginning of the Karzai government we were at home, living our normal life," he said. "I was a farmer supporting my wife and kids. The police surrounded our house in October 2002 and said 'you're involved with the Taliban,' and they arrested me and took me to Bagram prison."
What happened at Camp Bastion?
The declining state of Afghan war
Drug addiction rampant on Kabul streets Music healing Afghan war wounds Nasim says many men in his town were rounded up that day. "They accused me of being involved with the Taliban and attacking Jalalabad airport about 40 kilometers from my home, but I asked them, 'How was I involved in an attack on the airport when you arrest me in my house, with my family?'"
Despite Nasim's claim of innocence, U.S. records reveal he was in possession of rocket motors and other equipment when he was taken into custody -- an allegation he strongly denies. He was taken to Bagram Prison, which was at the time was run by the U.S. Defense Department, and claims he was tortured there.
"Yes, yes, I was tortured," he said. "They gave me electric shots on my wrists. I was hung from the ceiling for seven days. Our faces were masked, and we were handcuffed, hanging from the ceiling. Our legs were chained as well.""
As he explains his story he plays out the torture scenes, raising his arms into the air.
"A guard would keep shaking the chain so we couldn't sleep for seven days," he said. "I completely lost my mind. I was hanging from the ceiling; my body was aching. They would hit our heads into the wall."
Asked about Nasim's allegations of torture at Bagram, a spokesman for the Department of Defense in Washington released a statement that did not specifically reference his claims, but said in part:
"DoD does not tolerate the abuse of detainees. All credible allegations of abuse are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate disciplinary action is taken when those allegations are substantiated. We take such matters very seriously.
"Although there have been substantiated cases of abuse in the past, for which U.S. service members have been held accountable, our enemies also have employed a deliberate campaign of exaggerations and fabrications. The suggestion that DoD personnel, the overwhelming majority of whom serve honorably, are or ever were engaged in systematic mistreatment of detainees is false and does not withstand scrutiny."
As we sat cross-legged in the dirt in the park, Nasim took in the panoramic view of Kabul, a city surrounded by rugged mountains amid a landscape so arid and dry -- and yet so beautiful. As he gazed out, almost lost in thought, I asked him if he thought he would survive his time in Bagram. He said, "I felt completely hopeless. Some people inside killed themselves. I too had lost all hope. I thought I was going to die in there."
A guard would keep shaking the chain so we couldn't sleep for seven days. Our faces were masked, and we were handcuffed, hanging from the ceiling.Mohammad Nasim, former Afghan prisoner
It was during this period that two Afghan prisoners, Habibullah and Dilawar who were also hung by their wrists, were beaten to death by U.S. soldiers in Bagram Prison in December 2002. A U.S. military investigation later found that abuse had been widespread that year and the following.
After five months in Bagram, Nasim was transferred to Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba as a "medium-risk" prisoner. Guantanamo was not like Bagram, he said. "Every prisoner had their own small room. We spent three months separately in confinement. After three months they took us up to camp 5. It was difficult to cope but not as bad as Bagram."
After four and a half years in Guantanamo Bay, Nasim was finally released. "An American woman said, 'we're sorry,'" he said. "But what to do with their sorry? I spent five years of my life there. I was innocent. You take me away from my family, my children. Who supported them while I was locked up? I lost five years of my life.""
Nasim, who's now 36 but looks at least a decade older, is still very upset about what hey says happened to him. He says he's received no compensation and no formal apology. The father of five said, "It made me feel like I wanted to go out and kill all of them. If somebody takes you to the prison for five years, how would you feel? I was very angry. My hurt was blasting."
His level of anger has subsided over the years, but he believes the Americans and international forces need to get out of Afghanistan.
"This will be a better place once they've all gone. We don't need them. Afghans can run their own country," he said.

NYC marathoners -- with no race to run due to Sandy -- can get entry-fee refund
By Kristina Sgueglia, CNN
updated 8:31 PM EST, Thu December 20, 2012
iReporter Rachel Cauvin says that every New Yorker should watch the ING New York City Marathon at least once in their lives.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The New York City Marathon was canceled in the wake of Superstorm Sandy
Race organizers say runners can now get refund for their entry fees
Or runners can opt for guaranteed entry into an upcoming race
New York (CNN) -- They never got to run their race because of Superstorm Sandy, but ING New York City Marathon entrants can now at least recoup their entry fee, organizers of the marquee 26-mile test of human endurance said Thursday.
Citing "extraordinary circumstances," the New York Road Runners organization is offering runners the option of getting a full refund of their entry fee. Entry fees for the canceled 2012 race varied from $216 for members of the New York Road Runners and $255 for non-members to $347 for runners from outside the United States. The refund offer exclude an $11 processing fee, race organizers said.
Race organizers also offered two other options -- a guaranteed place in the always-crowded field for the New York Marathon one year during the next three years, or guaranteed entry into the NYC Half Marathon in March. But in those cases, runners would not get back their fees for this year's race and they would have to pay fees for whichever future race they chose.
Runners vented frustrations about the latter two options on the marathon's Facebook page, complaining that they unfairly created a one-race-for-two-fees deal.
Meanwhile, John Shostrom,captain of the Brooklyn Road Runners, told CNN the offers by marathon organizers gave runners "a decent range of options to choose from."
The situation is "really good for people who are leaning toward option one (refund of 2012 entry fee)." Shostrom, a copy editor for Sports Illustrated, said Thursday.
But the other two options make for "an income maximizer for the Road Runners in terms of all those people who feel like they really have to do another race ... it's a way of getting double payment for one actual race."
Whichever options runners choose, a considerable total amount of money is involved. For the 2011 New York City Marathon, more than 47,000 runners paid their fees and pounded the pavements on a 26.2-mile course that snaked through all five of the city's boroughs.
The 2012 marathon, scheduled for November 4,was canceled for the first time in its history so as not to draw resources and attention away from the response to Superstorm Sandy, which had blasted the New York and New Jersey areas only days before. By the scheduled race day, many areas were still without electricity and thousands of people were in need of aid.
Just as the cancellation marked a first for the marathon in its 42-year history, race organizers pointed out that the refund offer also was a first.
"We started with the premise that despite (organizers') no-refund policy, we needed to be able to offer runners that choice. Beyond that, we wanted to make sure they had as full options to run again as possible," Mary Wittenberg, president and CEO of New York Road Runners told CNN in an e-mail.
Wittenberg said while race organizers would have liked to have offered waived entry fees for other events, "we couldn't do that protect our other races and running programs."
Runners have until January 25 to choose an option.

Petraeus apologizes for affair, says 'it was my own doing' From CNN Staff
updated 9:28 AM EDT, Wed March 27, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Petraeus resigned last year as head of the CIA
He admitted to having an affair with his biographer In a rare public appearance, he express "regret" (CNN) -- In a rare public appearance since admitting to an extramarital affair, David Petraeus apologized Tuesday night for the scandal that led to his resignation as head of the CIA last year.
Petraeus, a retired four-star general, has stayed out of the limelight since the affair was revealed in November.
"Please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret and apologize for the circumstances that led to my resignation from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters," Petraeus told a crowd gathered at a Los Angeles hotel ballroom. "I am also keenly aware that the reason for my recent journey was my own doing."
Obama taps Brennan as CIA director
CIA Director David Petraeus stepped down Friday, November 9, 2012, citing an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Many questions surround the affair, including why it was necessary for Petraeus to resign and the future of his marriage to his wife, Holly. Here's a look at other U.S. sexual scandals that led to political stumbles and downfalls.
Former actor and California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger made headlines in 2011 when his longtime wife, journalist Maria Shriver of the Kennedy clan, filed for divorce after learning Schwarzenegger had fathered a son with the couple's housekeeper. Schwarzenegger recently began talking publicly about the affair, released an autobiography and made a return to acting. He has said he hopes to win Shriver back.
Former president Bill Clinton's denial of his affair with then-intern Monica Lewinsky jeopardized his seat in the Oval Office. News of the affair surfaced in 1998, and Clinton became the second president to be impeached by the U.S. House when he was brought up on charges of lying to a grand jury and trying to influence the testimony of others but wasn't removed from office. He is still married to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, issued an apology "for a very serious sin in my past" after his phone number showed up in the records of Pamela Martin and Associates, and escort service run by Deborah Jeane Palfrew, aka the "D.C. Madam" Vitter is still serving in the Senate and is still married. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, caused a stir in Washington in 2011 when he was caught using social media to communicate with at least six women other than his wife, Huma Abedin. Weiner left office in his seventh term in Congress. Shortly after his resignation, news broke the Abedin was pregnant with their first child. Today, the couple is still married, and Weiner is a stay-at-home dad to their son. Weiner rejoined Twitter earlier this month.
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick apologized to his wife and the city after romantic messages, reported by the Detroit Free Press, indicated the Democrat was having an affair with his chief of staff. The chief of staff, Christine Beatty, resigned, but Kilpatrick, said he would not. In testimony last August, both Beatty and Kilpatrick had denied having a romantic relationship. Kilpatrick later resigned. He is serving a prison sentence of up to five years for violating probation in a 2008 case against him. That case involved two state felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up the extramarital affair. John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator and Democratic presidential hopeful, saw his political career spin off track when he finally admitted in 2008 that he was unfaithful to his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth Edwards. Edwards at first denied the affair but ultimately came clean about fathering a child with his campaign videographer, Rielle Hunter. Prosecutors accused Edwards of illegally using hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps, but he was granted a mistrial on May 31, 2012. Elizabeth Edwards died in 2010. Former Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, agreed to step down temporarily as the leading Republican on Senate committees after details came out about his 2007 arrest in an airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Picked up during a police sting targeting lewd behavior in the airport's restrooms Craig pleased guilty to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge in August 2007. No sexual contact is alleged to have taken place but the officer who arrested the senator said Craig moved his foot to touch the officer's foot in another stall. Craig, who is married, said he did not make any "inappropriate contact." He called his guilty plea a "poor decision" and denied being gay. Former Rep. Mark Foley, R-Florida, resigned in September 2006 after he was accused of sending sexually explicit instant messages and e-mails to congressional pages. Florida authorities opened an investigation, as did the FBI. Foley later checked into a treatment facility for alcoholism. Weeks after separating from his wife, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa acknowledged he had been having an affair with a local television reporter. "It is true that I have a relationship with Ms. Mirthala Salinas," the Democrat said in a statement published in the Los Angeles Daily News. "As I've said I take full responsibility for my actions, and I once again ask that people respect my family's privacy. For my part, I intent to stay focused on my job and to work as hard as I can every day to be the best mayor I can be." Villaraigosa and his wife divorced in 2010. He is still mayor. Days before the House voted to impeach President Clinton, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-Louisiana, admitted to cheating on his wife. On the day of the impeachment vote, Livingston, a Republican who was to succeed Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House, announced he would resign from Congress in six months. He urged Clinton to do the same. "I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow," he said.
When then-South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford went MIA for nearly a week in June of 2009, his staff told the public he was out hiking the Appalachian Trail. But when the Republican was spotted at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, he decided to come clean about the mysterious hiking trip and quite a bit more. Sanford admitted he was not hiking, but visiting his Argentinian mistress in Buenos Aires. Though his wife, Jenny, said she was open to reconciliation, Sanford was head-over-heels for paramour Maria Belen Chapur. The Sanfords divorced. He became engaged to Belen Chapur in August. Eliot Spitzer earned a squeaky clean image as the attorney general of New York who took on Wall Street corruption from 1999 to 2006. From there, he moved to the governor's mansion in Albany in 2007. But the Democrat was stopped in his political tracks when his liaisons with high-paid prostitute Ashley Dupre surfaced, and he stepped down as governor in March 2008. He briefly went on to anchor and now hosts "Viewpoint'" on Current TV. He is still married to Silda Wall Spitzer. In 2009, then Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, admitted having an affair with Cindy Hampton, a campaign aide and the wife of his former chief of staff, Doug Hampton. Investigators examined the former senator's efforts to assist the Hampton family by providing a payment of nearly $100,000, arranging lobbying work for Doug Hampton and possibly meeting with him on a lobbying matter in violation of Senate rules. Hampton was sentenced to a year of probation for violating lobbying laws. Ensign never faced charges. Public figures, private missteps

Petraeus apologizes for affair
Uniform alluring for 'military groupies'
His comments came at an annual University of Southern California dinner to honor the military. It was one of the fist major public appearance since the scandal derailed the illustrious career of the decorated Army general.
Petraeus, who once ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from his CIA post in November.
He admitted he had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
The affair came to light during an FBI investigation of "jealous" e-mails Broadwell reportedly sent to another woman.
At the speech Tuesday, he tried to move the focus from his past problems and shine a light on the accomplishments of military members.
"I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago," he said. "But tonight is not about me. It is about your veterans. Your active duty military and your ROTC cadets."

Warren Buffett opens his wallet for Piers Morgan and America
See show times »
By Lateef Mungin, CNN
updated 7:20 AM EDT, Wed October 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world
During an interview he offered opinions on Obamacare and the government shutdown
He also gave a peek at what is in his wallet: a wad of $100 bills
No smartphone for Sage of Omaha; he uses an old flip cell phone
(CNN) -- He played the ukelele, weighed in on the Obamacare debacle and even flashed his prehistoric flip cell phone.
Suffice it to say, we got to see another side of Warren Buffett during an interview with Piers Morgan Tuesday night.
Accompanied by his son and grandson, the billionaire investor gave his unique take on almost everything.
And with that, he let Morgan and American take a quick peek in his wallet. Literally.
Warren Buffett plays ukulele for Piers
Buffett: I've only sent one e-mail
Warren Buffett on power of a handshake
Warren Buffett: We can't play games
Here are some of the highlights.
On Obamacare and Kathleen Sebelius
Buffett has in the past supported President Barack Obama. And it seems that this support extends to embattled U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Buffett says give Sebelius some time to fix the Obamacare mess she is overseeing.
"I am a friend of Kathleen's. And I'm a friend of her when she's in trouble. I like Kathleen. I feel sorry for her in the position she's in. Obviously, it's a huge screw up but it will get worked out, " Warren Buffet told Piers Morgan.
On technology
Can you tell a lot about the wealth of a man from his cell phone? Apparently not when it comes to the 83-year-old financial guru.
"This is the one Alexander Graham Bell gave me," joked Buffett, as he revealed a Nokia flip phone, a relic compared to today's smartphones. "I don't throw anything away until I've had it 20 or 25 years."
By the way, Buffett's son, Howard Graham Buffett, did not bring a phone to the interview.
And grandson Howard Warren Buffett led the three generations when it came to technology. He had two Blackberries.
Buffett's standoffish approach to technology extends to e-mail.
"I sent one e-mail in my life," revealed Warren Buffett. "I sent it to Jeff Raikes at Microsoft and it ended up in court in Minneapolis, so I am one for one."
On his biggest mistake
When you are one of the richest people in the world, it is hard to say you made many mistakes. Buffett listed one.
"I bought a company in the mid-90s called Dexter Shoe and paid $400 million for it," Buffett said. "And it went to zero. And I gave about $400 million worth of Berkshire stock, which is probably now worth $400 billion. But I've made lots of dumb decisions. That's part of the game."
On his wallet
Buffett says he has been carrying the same wallet for 20 years. And when Morgan asked Buffett to show America what is inside, he obliged.
He whipped out the black wallet for a split second. If you blinked you missed it. The highlights: A family picture. A wad of hundreds. And an American Express card from 1964.
"It goes with the cell phone," Buffett joked about the almost 50-year-old credit card.
On the shutdown showdown
At least one part of the recent battle between Democrats and Republicans that caused a 16-day government shutdown should never happen again, Buffett says. The battle should not take place around whether to raise the debt ceiling limit, he said.
It could be catastrophic to the economy.
"I think that both parties should declare the debt limit as a political weapon of mass destruction which can't be used," he said. "I mean, it is silly to have a country that has 237 years building up its reputation and then have people threaten to tear it down because they're not getting some other matter."
On investment
Who wouldn't ask the "Oracle of Omaha," who made his fortune investing, for a stock tip? Fans watching the interview needled Morgan via Twitter to ask the Nebraska billionaire how he would invest $1,000 right now.
Buffett's answer: "Well you asked," he coyly told Morgan. "You've done your job."
It seems investment advice doesn't come easy.
"I can't even get an answer to that question," Howard Graham Buffett joked.
