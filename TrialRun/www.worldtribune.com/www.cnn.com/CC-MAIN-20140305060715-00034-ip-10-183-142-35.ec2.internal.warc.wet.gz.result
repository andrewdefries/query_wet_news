Who's next?By Henry Schuster CNN Editor's note: Henry Schuster, a senior producer in CNN's Investigative Unit and author of "Hunting Eric Rudolph," has been covering terrorism for more than a decade. Each week in "Tracking Terror," he reports on people and organizations driving international and domestic terrorism, and efforts to combat them. By the time he released his propaganda video, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was known around the world. TRACKING TERROR E-MAILE-mail us: Send questions and comments to

(CNN) -- The first time I heard Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's name was in early 2002.I don't think anyone at the time could have predicted how he was about to kill his way to notoriety.I was in Amman, Jordan, with a colleague, and an intelligence official suggested we start paying attention to al-Zarqawi. He explained how al-Zarqawi had been tried for a plot to blow up Jordanian hotels on the eve of the millennium.By the time U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell mentioned al-Zarqawi's name before the United Nations in February 2003, claiming that he was the link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda, we were very much on the story.Nothing that we heard about al-Zarqawi suggested any direct links to the Saddam Hussein regime. And while he had spent time in Afghanistan, details of his relationship with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden were murky.Hunting al-ZarqawiThen al-Zarqawi seemed to explode into public consciousness. He became public enemy No. 1 in Iraq sometime after the 2003 bombings of the U.N. compound and Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad.There were so many rumors: Did he really have a false leg as a result of a wound suffered in Afghanistan? (No, as it turned out.) Was he Palestinian? (No, again.)My colleague Nic Robertson and I tried to follow al-Zarqawi's trail.He still seemed to have support in Zarqa, Jordan, the home of his family and the town from which he derived his name.In Amman, we walked through the bombed out hotel ballrooms where his suicide bombers had slaughtered 60 people in November 2005.In other towns in Jordan we talked to his friends and his enemies.On the Internet, we saw al-Zarqawi lay out his bloody vision of sectarian strife between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, and finally saw him show his face in a breathtakingly egotistical video just a few weeks ago.We were always trying to figure out how a troubled young Jordanian evolved into an uncompromising terrorist who apparently beheaded an American hostage and put the videotape on the Internet.In al-Zarqawi's mind, perhaps, it all made sense. Not to me.There were missed chances to catch him, but even al-Zarqawi seemed to know his death or capture was only a matter of time."Eyes are everywhere," he wrote to bin Laden. Perhaps that's why he kept his face hidden for so long, until that April videotape.About three weeks ago, before I left for Afghanistan, I updated al-Zarqawi's obituary. It's just one of those things you do, in case he was captured or killed.It might have been wishful thinking at the time, but now his death is a reality.One downIt doesn't take long for the question to be begged: If you can catch al-Zarqawi why can't you catch bin Laden or his top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri?
If we happen to run across a leader or someone high up in [the Taliban or al Qaeda], we will attempt to capture or kill them, but that is not our principal focus.
-- U.S. Col. John Nicholson
The only time bin Laden's name came up in Afghanistan over the past couple of weeks was when we asked. Especially with the U.S. military."It's not about any one man," Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry told us. However, he added that the 23,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, as well as the CIA and other intelligence agencies there, had "an obligation to one day either kill or capture bin Laden."Col. John Nicholson, who commands along the Pakistan border in the east, also made it clear that his troops were less concerned with finding bin Laden than routing out the Taliban and any al Qaeda fighters who came their way."We are focused on killing or capturing al Qaeda wherever we find it," Nicholson said. "As far as if we happen to run across a leader or someone high up in their hierarchy, we will attempt to capture or kill them, but that is not our principal focus."Neither officer said they had any evidence that bin Laden or al-Zawahiri was in Afghanistan. Instead, the working theory continues to be that both men are across the border in Pakistan.That border is in many ways more hypothetical than real, particularly to the tribes that live on both sides, Nicholson said.By way of example, a young lieutenant recounted a recent firefight with insurgents. It began when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his car. It ended with the insurgents making their escape back across the Pakistan border just a few hundred yards away.Americans, on the other hand, can't easily or often cross the border. The United States in January sent a missile into Pakistan, striking a house where al-Zawahiri was thought to be. The result was different than that of the attack on al-Zarqawi.Instead of a victory news conference, replete with high-tech footage, we got video of corpses and bewildered villagers.There are all sorts of other reasons why getting bin Laden has been harder to get than al-Zarqawi: he's less active, he's in a presumably much more remote location, and the United States doesn't have the ability to strike in Pakistan that it does in Iraq.But the question remains: Now that al-Zarqawi is dead, will either bin Laden or al-Zawahiri be next?

Below is a full transcript of the interview. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari speaks with CNN's Larry King on Tuesday.more photos » Larry King: It's a privilege to welcome to Larry King Live the president of Pakistan, from his office in Islamabad, President Asif Ali Zardari. He took office in September. He's the widower of the former Pakistani prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, both of whom were on this program in the past. Now, Mr. President, aside from the gunmen themselves, who do you believe was responsible for the terrorist attacks against Mumbai? Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari: Larry, I think these are stateless actors who have been operating all throughout the region. The gunmen, plus the planners, whoever they are, they are stateless actors who are holding hostage the whole world. King: So the state of Pakistan is in no way responsible, you're saying. Right? Zardari: The state of Pakistan is no way responsible. That I believe. Watch Zardari talking to CNN's Larry King » Even the White House and the American CIA have said that today. The state of Pakistan is of course not involved. We're part of the victims, Larry. I'm a victim. The state of Pakistan is a victim. We are the victims of this war, and I am sorry for the Indians, and I feel sorry for them. I've seen this pain. I feel this pain every time I see my children. I can see it in their eyes. This pain lives with me because of my wife and what we are going through in Pakistan. King: What do you know about this lone surviving attacker, the man that's in custody? Is he definitely a Pakistani? Larry King Exclusive

Zardari: Not as yet. We have not been giving any tangible proof to say that he is definitely a Pakistani. I very much doubt, Larry, that he's a Pakistani. King: Really? Who do you think -- what's your guess? ZARDARI: Like I said, these are stateless individuals who operate throughout -- I mean, I've got a situation in Pakistan that the fourth largest army in the world is challenged on my border on the west. I've got 150 people out, boys out, soldiers out. We have casualties every day. We've had incidents just the past two days in Karachi where we've lost more than 40 to 45 people, hundreds injured. These are stateless actors who are moving throughout this region. King: What do you believe is the responsibility, if any, of -- I want to get this right -- Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group that's aimed at ending Indian rule in Kashmir? Do you think they're involved? Zardari: That's a banned organization, Larry, in Pakistan and all around the world. If indeed they are involved, we would not know. Again, they are people who operate outside the system. They operate like -- al Qaeda, for instance, is not state-oriented. They operate something on that mechanism, and we would love to -- I've already offered to India full cooperation on this incident, and we intend to do that.

Special report: Attacks in Mumbai
King: Do you believe that al Qaeda -- you mentioned them -- might be involved? Zardari: We cannot rule anything out at the moment, Larry. It's too premature. King: All right. Pakistan, you've called on India to produce evidence of the complicity of any Pakistani group in the attacks. If it's produced, what would you do? Zardari: I would -- my government would take action, our government would take action, the democratic government of Pakistan would take action against all the actors and anybody who is involved. King: So you're firmly committed to getting at the root of this? Zardari: Not just the root of this. I'm firmly committed to fighting terrorism per se. That's why we are fighting them every day, Larry. King: In a new interview, India's external affairs minister has declined to rule out the possibility of Indian military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. He says that every country has a right to protect itself. Do you agree with that? Zardari: I would not agree with that because this is a time to come together and do a joint investigation and look at the problem in the larger context. We have a larger threat on our hands. The threat is in the region, and just not to Bombay or to India. The threat to the state of Pakistan. There's a threat to the state of Afghanistan. It's a threat throughout the region. So that would be counterproductive, Larry. King: Both your nation and India have nuclear arms. Would Pakistan ever make -- can you conceive of Pakistan ever making a preemptive strike? Zardari: Larry, I've already been on record, and I have said so, that Pakistan has no intention of ever being the perpetrator of first use. King: Would you favor the ban of all nuclear weapons everywhere? Zardari: In fact, I've invited the Indian... King: I'm sorry -- go ahead. Zardari: I have asked the Indians to join me. I have asked the Indians to join us in a nuclear-free South Asia. And we are willing -- I am willing to assure the world, on behalf of my parliament, that if India comes with us, we can together jointly sign a nuclear-free South Asia. Watch new video of gunfire erupting at a cafe » King: Do you think that would happen? Do you think it could happen? Zardari: We can definitely stand on the possibility of that to happen, Larry. King: All right. Your nation and India, you fought three wars since the subcontinent was divided at the end of British rule back in 1947. What do you think is the potential for another war now? Zardari: Larry, democracies don't go to war. All those wars you're talking about did not take place in any democracy. They all happened in the times of dictators. So democracies do not go to war. War is not our expression of thought. King: What about America in Iraq? Zardari: Well, that's exactly an example today that America went to Iraq in a reaction to the attack on America. That's a reactive action, and that is something that the terrorists are always looking for, because they can corner the state stateless, actors can corner the state to go into a motion or an action which otherwise they would not do. This is exactly the fear, and that's why we should rise above it. King: Mr. President, are you -- by the way, are you actively working at finding out who caused this attack? Zardari: Obviously, all my state of practice is looking into the allegation that has been thrown at us from across the border. Obviously, if an accusation of this sort comes [we will] ask the intelligence agencies to investigate. King: And do you have a lot of respect for and confidence in your intelligence agency? Zardari: That, and the fact that we are all hoping to improve our relationships with India and all the democracies of the world. The whole nation of Pakistan is united to making -- having friends -- becoming friends with India. King: This was just issued this morning, Mr. President. "The odds that terrorists will soon strike a major city with weapons of mass destruction are now better than even. This, a bipartisan congressionally-mandated task force concluded in a draft study, and they particularly single out Pakistan with grave concern because of its terrorist attacks, history of instability and arsenal of several dozen nuclear warheads." How do you act to that report? Zardari: Ever the more reason that Pakistan needs more help, more attention, and more looking into and looking after. So we appeal to the world and the world at large, and our neighbors, to sit down and find solutions to all problems facing the region in today's times. King: The report also said, "Pakistan is our ally, but there is a grave danger. It can also be an unwitting source of a terrorist attack on the United States, possibly with weapons of mass destruction." Do you agree? Zardari: Well, that's a position that has been going -- it's a continued situation which we've inherited. It's part of the Afghan problem, part of the war in Afghanistan, part of the war in our northern regions. That is an issue that needs more attention, and I'm hoping that the new administration coming in will work with us to look into it for a regional solution. We've been advocating a regional solution. We need more participation from our neighbors, India, China, and extended neighbors as such in the UAE. We all need to come together on a collective mindset and find solutions to that problem. King: By the way, what do you make of President-elect Obama? Zardari: I think there's a world romance with Obama. And we all in Pakistan -- throughout the world there's a romance to Obama, and we are looking forward to working with him. King: What steps, Mr. President, is your government taking to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons? This is something every country fears. Are you taking steps at preventing it? Zardari: We have a command and control system for that. We're a very responsible state as far as that subject goes, and we have a command and control system under a special organization. King: And are you confident that they're working well? Zardari: Yes, I'm totally confident that our command and control system is working well. King: Because in the past, Mr. President, the Pakistani intelligence apparatus has provided support for militant movements. And what is the government doing to root that out? Zardari: In the past, lots of mistakes have been made, I cannot deny that. But the present government does not support any such action and the -- I can assure the world from my side, from my Army's side, from my parliament's side and the people of Pakistan that we are not helping any such activity. King: Mr. President, the Indian government is demanding that your nation hand over some 20 suspected terrorists believed to be living in Pakistan. What is your response to this? Among those are Dawa Dabron, a powerful gangster, Masoud Azar, a terror suspect from Indian prison, in exchange for the release of hostages. And Hafiz Muhammad, the former chief of a terrorist group. Are you going to comply with that? Zardari: I am definitely going to look into all the possibility of any proof that is given to us. At the moment these are just names of individuals. No proof, no investigation, nothing has been brought to forward. We have offered to take this step forward and cooperate with the Indians. I am willing to have my security advisor and their security in charge of our intelligence security and their intelligence security, have a joint committee which we have proposed to the Indians for a joint investigation in all -- in the Bombay incident. King: And if you had the proof you would turn them over? Zardari: If we had the proof, we would try them in our courts, we would try them in our land and we would sentence them. King: Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state is coming to India, coming today I think. Would you meet with her? Zardari: I am hoping to meet with her in Pakistan. She is hoping -- I think she is coming here too. King: What do you make and how do you look forward to working with the possible incoming secretary of state, Hillary Clinton? Zardari: I am looking forward to working with Hillary Clinton. We know each other, we've met before, we have known each other for a long time, since my wife's time. She has been a good friend of Pakistan in the past and we hope to work with her, we're looking forward to working with her. King: Do you think she is a good choice? Zardari: I think she is an excellent choice. King: All right. Do you -- during the campaign, President-elect Obama said he believes that if the United States is given actionable intelligence, it has the right to attack high value terrorist targets in Pakistan with or without permission of the Pakistani government. What do you make of that? Zardari: I think it's a misquote. I think the actual quote is that if we did not take action then the president-elect has said that he would take action. But that would never arise. The minute we get any actionable intelligence given to us we shall act ourselves. King: Do you believe that the Mumbai attacks may have been partly intended to destabilize your own government? You're trying to get rapprochement with India, you think they were trying to upset that? Zardari: That is my position, Larry. I have been trying to advocate throughout the world that the stateless actors, states to hold states and they want states to go into wars, do wars, it's happened in the past. You will remember history correctly, even the Second World War was perpetrated by a stateless actor, murdering of the prince if you'll remember and so is the case of 9/11, it was a stateless actor who willed the world go to war. So we should all rise above it. I expect the Indian democracy which is senior, which is an older democracy, mature democracy, I expect them to rise above this pain and the loss that they have had and come together with us to fight terrorism in the region. King: There are some suggestions that the more vehemently India calls on you to crack down on militants, the tougher politically it is for you to do so. Do you buy that? Zardari: Larry, politics has never been an easy place in Pakistan and it's not easy to inherit from a dictator so I -- it's a difficult place, it's a difficult choice but we will rise to difficult challenges. King: This may be an impossible question but we'll ask it anyway. Do you believe it's possible for you and India to live in peace? Zardari: I am looking forward and I am hoping that I will be the catalyst that makes India and Pakistan live in peace forever. King: So you would meet with the leaders there as well? Zardari: Of course. I am looking forward to that. I am looking forward to making it a regional economical zone. I am looking forward to working in all walks of life together and India is a neighbor, it is 1 billion plus people, it's a market, it's an opportunity, relations with India is an opportunity for Pakistan. King: A couple of other things. There are many who believe that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan. Are you trying to find him? Zardari: Larry, the Americans and the world forces have been in Afghanistan and around my region and have much, much better technology and intelligence than we have. If you think he was there or anywhere around they would have gotten before me but in case I do get any intelligence and I do find out. We will definitely try and take the trophy ourselves if we can. King: What would you do with him if you found him? Zardari: That's a hypothetical question. Hopefully arrest and try him. King: In Pakistan? Zardari: We can see, we can talk about it. It's a hypothetical question, Larry. First let's find him. Nobody has been able to find him in the past eight years.

Early results show major loss for Fatah party's old guardStory Highlights Unofficial returns show many of party's longtime leaders lost seats on key committee One apparent loser: former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei Party members want "new faces, a new spirit," one Fatah member says Hamas militants warn new Fatah leaders not to repeat "mistakes" of the past Next Article in World » JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Senior members of the Palestinian Fatah party appear to have suffered a serious upset in a vote to determine the party's key decision-making body. Fatah officials count ballots after a vote for the party leadership in Bethlehem on Monday. Fatah party members voted among 18 candidates who are vying for seats on the Central Committee, the party's highest decision-making body. Final results will be released later on Tuesday, the last day of the party's weeklong conference -- its first in 20 years. Unofficial results show a major upheaval of Fatah's old guard. One shock is the apparent ousting from the committee of former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei, who is the head of the Palestinian negotiating team and a key member of Fatah in the West Bank. "People want new faces, a new spirit with more energy and with more strength, because we have a very long struggle ahead," Fayez al-Saka, a Fatah member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, told CNN in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. Fatah is led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Don't Miss Hamas accused over rocket attacks

Based on the initial results, new committee members include imprisoned politician and militant leader Marwan Barghouti, who is serving several life sentences in an Israeli prison on charges of killing an Israeli civilian and attacking Israeli soldiers. Also securing seats for the first time, based on the initial results, are top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat; former Palestinian security adviser Jibril Rajoub; and Nasser al-Kidwa, the former Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations and nephew of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The unofficial results show a thin margin of victory for at least two positions on the committee, meaning there may have to be a recount. Hamas -- the militant Palestinian Islamist movement that controls Gaza -- warned the new leadership not to repeat the "mistakes" of their predecessors. "The newly elected Fatah leadership will be weighed on its adherence to the rights of the Palestinian people, the steadfastness, unity, resistance and commitment to end the strife within the Palestinian rivalry," Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said. Hamas has long accused Fatah and its leaders in the West Bank city of Ramallah of holding and imprisoning Hamas members inside Palestinian Authority prisons.

Bombs target newspapers in Nigeria
From Vladimir Duthiers, CNN
updated 6:58 AM EDT, Sun April 29, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A third bomb blast is confirmed in Nigeria, Red Cross says
At least eight people reported were killed, including a suicide bomber
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan condemns the attacks
(CNN) -- At least eight people were killed, including one suicide bomber, and dozens were wounded in three bomb blasts in central and northern Nigeria on Thursday, the Red Cross said.
The targets of the first two bombs were newspaper offices, the country's president said. The third blast, in the northern state of Kaduna, was confirmed by emergency management officials, but no information on casualties or damage was available.
In the first incident in Kaduna, a man drove a vehicle into a two-story building that houses three national newspapers: ThisDay, The Moment and The Sun. According to a reporter at one of the dailies, when the car hit the wall, passers-by and newspaper staff ran to the site to see what happened.
According to the Red Cross, the bomb did not explode on impact, and the bystanders tried to get the suspected bomber out of the car. Once that was accomplished, the suspect threw a bomb at the bystanders, killing four and wounding 19, then tried to flee, the Red Cross said.
Other bystanders caught the suspected bomber and turned him over to police.
Within 30 minutes of the first blast in Kaduna, a suicide bomber in the central city of Abuja detonated a bomb that killed four people, including himself, said the Red Cross, which described the explosions as "the first direct attack on the media by (an) unknown armed group."
Seven people were wounded, it said.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the attacks on the newspaper offices, calling them "ignoble, misguided, horrendous and wicked."

Video purportedly shows Libyans rushing to aid U.S. ambassador
From Arwa Damon, CNN
updated 11:54 AM EDT, Tue September 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and 3 others were killed last Tuesday in Libya
A video shows a wounded "foreigner" dragged from a window that night
The man who shot the video says it's Stevens; a U.S. official says they're not sure
The Libyans rejoice when they discover the man is alive and try to get him help
Editor's note: Read a version of this story in Arabic
Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- The chaos is palpable, as a throng of Libyans frantically scramble outside a damaged building. Suddenly, a man's body is carried from inside toward an open window -- and the frenzy and sounds become even more urgent, more emotional.
"Get him out!" some yell.
After joyfully discovering the man -- a foreigner, apparently, a voice in the crowd says -- is alive after he's dragged out, fresh screams ring out.
"Allahu Akbar," which translates from Arabic to "God is great," men in the crowd shout. Others raise fists to the sky, seemingly rejoicing that this man has somehow survived.
According to the man who shot the video, the wounded man shown is Chris Stevens, the late U.S. ambassador to Libya. If true, the grainy images show some of his last moments alive: Stevens was one of four Americans killed last Tuesday in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
More details emerge of ambassador's last moments
Attackers set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack.

Photos: Attack on U.S. Consulate in Libya
Baer: U.S. consulate 'underprotected'
Libya attacks: U.S. warned of threats
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland acknowledged the video Monday, even as she stressed it's not clear "whether or not it's authentic, whether or not it is an accurate representation of what happened, whether or not it's Ambassador Stevens."
"This video ... is going to be part and parcel of this investigation," Nuland told reporters. "But I'm not in a position to confirm what, who, where and whether it has any value."
That investigation will try to explain who is responsible, and what happened, the night of September 11 outside the U.S. consulate.
A strident crowd had gathered there, ostensibly to rail against the United States -- like Egyptian protesters were also doing about 780 miles (1250 kilometers) east in Cairo -- over the 14-minute trailer of an obscure, amateurishly and privately produced film mocking the Muslim prophet Mohammed.
Some of those in Benghazi eventually attacked the consulate, with Libyan and U.S. officials offering differing assessments on whether this assault was spontaneous or premeditated.
What is obvious is that, once they were done, the consulate was charred and heavily damaged, its walls blackened with smoke and its contents largely unrecognizable.
The man who shot the aforementioned video, Fahed al-Bakush, told CNN he'd arrived shortly before midnight to find the consulate cafeteria building up in flames.
More arrests in consulate attack
The smoke was so thick, he said, that you could barely see the consulate's main building.
Yet the video shows lots of activity, especially near an open window. People clambered in and out of it, aided by small flashlights and each other.
Eventually, the wounded man was carried out. Afterward, he's pictured on the ground in what appears to be a shirt and dark pants.
"He had a pulse and his eyes were moving," al-Bakush said of the man he said is Stevens. "His mouth was black from all the smoke."
With the man now outside, some yelled out," Carry him," and others said, "We need to take him ... to the hospital." A later photo, also seen online, showed the wounded man being put on another man's shoulder and whisked away.
By the time he arrived at a Benghazi hospital, it was too late.
"The body was covered with soot," said Dr. Ziad Abu, who treated Stevens that night. "I began resuscitation but after 45 minutes, the patient ... showed no signs of life."
Many questions remain about the attack that led to Stevens' death.
But if this video indeed shows the ambassador being taken from the consulate, as people thank God that he was breathing and tried to rush him to get medical help, it indicates that not everyone in Benghazi was bent on violence that night.
In fact, it appears that some men -- as evidenced by their words and actions -- were helping him, and very much wanted him to live.

Pope's book on Jesus challenges Christmas traditions
By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 10:56 AM EST, Fri November 23, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Pope Benedict says the accepted date for Jesus' birth is several years off
His book says the Gospels do not support the presence of animals at Jesus' birth
He is releasing "Jesus of Nazareth -- The Infancy Narratives" in time for Christmas
The book has an initial print run of more than a million copies, in several languages
(CNN) -- It's Christmas, but not as you know it: a new book released this week by Pope Benedict XVI looks at the early life of Jesus -- and debunks several myths about how the Nativity unfolded.
In "Jesus of Nazareth -- The Infancy Narratives," the pope says the Christian calendar is actually based on a blunder by a sixth century monk, who Benedict says was several years off in his calculation of Jesus' birth date.

According to the pope's research, there is also no evidence in the Gospels that the cattle and other animals traditionally pictured gathered around the manger were actually present.
Pope debunks Christmas myths He also debunks the claim that angels sang at the birth, a staple theme of Christmas carols.
The book, which is being published in multiple languages in time for Christmas, is the third in a series by the pontiff. The previous two volumes dealt with Jesus' adult life and his public ministry.

Alessandro Speciale, Vatican correspondent for the Religion News Service, told CNN the pope was not so much aiming to debunk myths as trying to show that the Jesus depicted in the Gospels is a real historical figure, who walked on earth and talked to people like anyone else.
The pope also looks at scholarly studies of the Bible, some of which have indicated for decades that the traditionally accepted birth date for Jesus is wrong, Speciale said.

But while the book points out that the Gospels do not support the presence of animals at Jesus' birth -- a detail apparently added in later centuries -- the pope does not suggest they should be thrown out of the Nativity scene, Speciale said.
"The pope is a traditional man and he doesn't want people at all to change their traditions," Speciale said.
The 176-page volume, which comprises a brief foreword, four chapters and an epilogue, traces Jesus' life up to the age of 12, when, according to the Gospels, he was presented by his parents in the Temple in Jerusalem, the Vatican said.
The initial worldwide print run is more than a million copies, it said, with the book released this week across 50 countries in Italian, German, Croatian, French, English, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.
In the coming months, the book will be translated into 12 more languages for publication in 72 countries in total, the Vatican added.
The Vatican quotes Anthony Valle, a professor of theology, as saying the pope has been open to scientific inquiry in his own study of Jesus' life.
"The pope is not against the historical critical method at all, in fact, he uses it, he appreciates it," Valle said.
He sees the pope as using "both faith and reason" in his efforts to bring the life of Jesus closer.
Monsignor Philip Whitmore, who translated the book into English, said the pontiff used his writing to explore "the inner meaning of the infancy narratives, showing how they pick up on Old Testament themes and develop them in new and unexpected ways."
"The pope helps us to understand the world where Jesus was born. Caesar brought peace to the Roman Empire, but this tiny child brought something much more wonderful: God's peace, eternal life, an end to sin and death," Whitmore added.
"Anyone who's wondering why Christmas came to be such a great celebration in the West can find the answer right here. The pope explains how the birth of Jesus changed history forever."

NYPD: For this 'Cookie Monster,' it was 'Me want money!' By Lawrence Crook, CNN
updated 11:21 AM EDT, Wed April 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The man was impersonating Cookie Monster to hustle money posing for photos, police say
When a toddler's parents refused to pay $2, this Cookie Monster apparently got mad
The child was shoved, and the costumed character was arrested
(CNN) -- C is for "Cookie," or is it "Cash"?
A man dressed as the TV character Cookie Monster allegedly shoved a 2-year-old after the child's parents refused the man's demand for $2 for posing for a photo, New York police say.
The child was not physically injured during the incident, according to police.
Detective Kelly Ort told CNN that 33-year-old Osvaldo Quiroz-Lopez of Queens was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and acting in a manner injurious to a minor after the incident Sunday in Times Square.
Quiroz-Lopez was dressed as the Cookie Monster character to make money by posing for photos with passersby, according to police, who added that there was no connection between the man and the TV series "Sesame Street," which counts Cookie Monster among its characters.
Quiroz-Lopez was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday and held with bail set at $1,000 cash, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office. His next court date is scheduled for May 1.
Attempts to reach Lopez and his attorney, Beth Unger from the Legal Aid Society, were unsuccessful.

Senate committee approves report reviewing technology transfer to China
May 6, 1999
Web posted at: 2:29 p.m. EDT (1829 GMT)
WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, May 6) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a report reviewing the transfer of secret missile technology to China and allegations of illegal campaign contributions by Beijing to American political candidates. The report is expected to be made public within the next day or two.
Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) would not comment on details of the report, saying it is still being reviewed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska) said the committee has produced a "bipartisan, non-partisan document" that is "relatively dull" on the "campaign side."
Asked if the report was critical of President Bill Clinton, Kerrey responded, "Well, it is certainly not a love letter," but a "candid evaluation of what went wrong." He added that there was some "poor oversight and poor policy."
The committee has been pursuing two separate, but intertwined, lines of inquiry. The first question is to what extent the Chinese government, working through Democratic fund-raisers, funneled campaign contributions into the 1996 campaign.
Former Democratic Party fund-raiser Johnny Chung has told federal investigators that the chief of China's military intelligence funneled $300,000 through him to back the Clinton/Gore 1996 re-election campaign, sources familiar with Chung's testimony told CNN last month.
The sources said only a portion of the money ever made it into Democratic Party coffers.
The Chinese government has denied the accusations. Federal law prohibits financial contributions to political campaigns from sources outside the United States.
The government also has been investigating whether Loral Space & Communications and other industry representatives illegally gave China an accident report on the explosion of a Long March missile in 1996 -- and whether, as the Pentagon alleges, that report contained information useful in improving China's long-range missiles. A second aspect of that investigation centered around how Hughes Electronics got the green light from the U.S. government to give Chinese authorities a study on a January 1995 incident, when a carrier rocket blew up and destroyed a U.S.-built satellite. The information transfer took place without comment or input by either the Pentagon or the State Department.
The report does not go into recent allegations of possible espionage at
the U.S. nuclear weapons laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott (R-Mississippi) will meet Thursday with the chairmen of the committees with jurisdiction over alleged Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory.
The chairmen include Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner (R-Virginia), Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms (R-North Carolina), Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico) and Intelligence chairman Shelby.
The group will update Lott on their latest findings and possibly discuss
legislative initiatives. CNN's Michael Roselli and Janet Moore contributed to this report.
