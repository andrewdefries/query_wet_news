TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- CNN was allowed to "resume its activities" in Iran Tuesday, the country's official news agency reported, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked that a ban on CNN journalists be lifted and the network be allowed to continue its work there.CNN was not directly informed by the Iranian government of the ban when it was reported to be imposed Monday, and has not been formally informed that the ban has been lifted.The official Iranian news agency IRNA said the president's chief of staff asked that the ban be lifted in a letter to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance sent Monday night.Government television station IRINN also reported the president's office called for the ministry to annul its prior decision banning CNN from working in Iran.IRNA reported Monday that the Iranian government banned CNN journalists from working in the country after a translation error broadcast by CNN mistakenly quoted Iran's president as saying his nation has the right to build nuclear weapons.The dispute arises from a moment of simultaneous translation Saturday.As Ahmadinejad was speaking, an interpreter working for a translation company hired by CNN misquoted him as having said Iran has the right to build nuclear weapons. In fact, he said Iran has the right to nuclear energy, and that "a nation that has civilization does not need nuclear weapons." He added, "our nation does not need them."The incorrect translation was re-broadcast on CNN later Saturday.As soon as it was alerted to the error Sunday, CNN corrected the translation and clarified Ahmadinejad's remarks, and the network apologized.In a written statement, CNN said it "apologized on all its platforms which included the translation error, including CNN International, CNN/USA and CNN.com, and also expressed its regrets to the Iranian government and the Iranian ambassador to the U.N."But the Iranian government, in the IRNA report, said it took a punitive measure against CNN, invalidating press cards of CNN journalists in Tehran.CNN, in its statement, said, "CNN is very disappointed that this action has been taken."The translation company, Lesley Howard Languages, apologized to CNN."Obviously, we're taking it very, very seriously. We will never use him again," owner Lesley Howard said, referring to the interpreter.She said the same interpreter, who like other interpreters is contracted for individual projects, has done good work in the past, including for CNN.She added that there is no reason to believe the interpreter purposely gave the wrong translation."We pride ourselves on having incredibly high standards," Howard said.

Document says number of attempted attacks on U.S. is at all-time highFrom Carol Cratty, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSDHS memo says number and pace of attempted attacks have surpassed "any other previous one-year period"Attacks are expected to be attempted with "increased frequency," document warnsReport cites recent cases of homegrown terrorism, including failed Times Square bombing Terror groups are increasingly using westerners as operatives, report says

National Counter Terrorism Center
Washington (CNN) -- Just weeks after the failed car bombing of New York's Times Square, the Department of Homeland Security says "the number and pace of attempted attacks against the United States over the past nine months have surpassed the number of attempts during any other previous one-year period." That grim assessment is contained in an unclassified DHS intelligence memo prepared for various law enforcement groups, which says terror groups are expected to try attacks inside the United States with "increased frequency." CNN obtained a copy of the document, dated May 21, which goes on to warn, "we have to operate under the premise that other operatives are in the country and could advance plotting with little or no warning." The intelligence note says recent attempted terror attacks have used operatives and tactics which made the plots hard to detect. The document specifically mentions the cases of Afghan national Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty in February to plotting attacks on New York's subways, and Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American. The intelligence report says both men spent significant time in the United States and were familiar with their alleged targets. Furthermore, the plots involved materials that can be commonly purchased in America without causing suspicion. The document also says Shahzad and Zazi had short periods of training overseas "compared to lengthier training cycles for earlier operations, reducing our ability to detect their activities." The report say U.S. officials "lack insights in specific details, timing and intended targets," but trends indicate terrorists are looking for "smaller, more achievable attacks against easily accessible targets." The report mentions both al Qaeda and associated groups such as the Tehrik e-Taliban Pakistan, which is known as the TTP. The intelligence document also says terror groups increasingly are using westerners as operatives or in leadership positions in which they make public statements calling for Muslims to strike the United States. The document cites as examples Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Alawki and al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn. The report also mentions Omar Hammami, who grew up in Alabama and is now believed to be an operative with al-Shabaab in Somalia. Although al-Shabaab has not executed attacks in the United States, law enforcement officials have expressed concern that Somali-Americans who have gone to Somalia to train and fight could return to the United States and commit acts of terrorism.

Attorney: Ohio moviegoer brought gun for protection
By Chris Boyette, CNN
updated 4:18 PM EDT, Fri August 10, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The attorney says CO shooting prompted his client to bring weapons to movie
A theater manager, police officer became suspicious because of where he sat
Police say Smith told them he was carrying a gun and knives to protect himself
(CNN) -- The attorney for Scott A. Smith, who was arrested after attending the latest Batman movie armed with a gun, ammunition and knives, said the deadly shooting in Aurora, Colorado, last month prompted his client to bring the weapons for protection.
"He had a fear and wanted to protect himself," attorney Matthew Bruce said Friday.
Smith, 37, made his first appearance in court Thursday and is currently being held on $250,000 bond.
He was arrested Saturday and charged with two counts of carrying a concealed weapon and 19 counts related to carrying weapons "under disability," charges that refer to the effects of prescription drugs Smith was taking, said Nicole DiSanto of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.
Police say Saturday night Smith went to the Regal Theater in Westlake, Ohio, to see the 10:30 p.m. showing of "The Dark Knight Rises."
CNN poll: Gun control attitudes haven't changed after shootings
According to DiSanto, Smith was the first to arrive, 30 minutes before the movie's start, and took a seat in the back row, directly in the middle, with his back to a wall. A manager at the theater and an off-duty police officer grew suspicious of where he sat, and they noticed the bag Smith was carrying.
They asked to search the bag, DiSanto said, and inside found a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, two loaded magazine clips and three knives. Police said Smith was carrying another knife on his person.
His attorney said he had arrived early to get the best seat in the theater.
"That's just the kind of person he is," said Bruce, who acknowledged that Smith was not carrying the gun legally.
Smith told the off-duty officer he was carrying the gun and knives for protection, to protect himself and other moviegoers, said police, who took him into custody. A search of Smith's home turned up more weapons, including rifles, shotguns and survivalist gear.
Montel Williams: 'I'm a gun owner'
Experts debate the issue of gun control
Analysis: Fewer U.S. gun owners own more guns
Westlake police Lt. Ray Arcuri said police believe Smith's position in the movie theater was "tactical:" not only was he protected from the back, but he could have fired to his right, left and center on anyone in the theater in front of him. About 80 people attended the movie that night.
In 1995, Smith enlisted in the U.S. Army but did not finish basic training, according to Army spokesman George Wright.
The charges against Smith follow the mass shooting last month in Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman fired on a crowd of moviegoers watching a showing of "The Dark Knight Rises." The attack killed 12 people.
CNN's Julian Cummings, Deb Feyerick and Karan Olson contributed to this report.

GOP's surprising edge on diversity
By John Avlon, CNN Contributor
updated 9:09 AM EST, Fri January 18, 2013
New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez speaks at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, on August 29, 2012. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
John Avlon: GOP senators, governors more diverse than Democrats
He says party has the edge in diversity among higher-ranking offices
Avlon says GOP has trouble attracting black, Hispanic voters
He adds that among members of House, GOP diversity sorely lacking
Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book "Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns." He is a regular contributor to "Erin Burnett OutFront" and is a member of the OutFront Political Strike Team. For more political analysis, tune in to "Erin Burnett OutFront" at 7 ET weeknights.
(CNN) -- Everybody knows the Republican Party is basically an all-white bastion, right? After all, even Colin Powell condemned the "dark vein of intolerance" that has flowed through his party since the post-civil rights era political realignment.
John Avlon
Now with President Barack Obama leading the Democrats into a second term -- buoyed by overwhelming victory margins among African-Americans and Hispanics -- it's clear the GOP has some serious catching up to do.
This is why it might surprise you to hear that Republicans are by far the more diverse party when it comes to statewide elected officials such as senators and governors. On this front, they leave Democrats in the dust. And that's why the GOP actually has a greater depth of diversity on their potential presidential bench looking to 2016 and beyond.

It's counterintuitive but true. Numbers don't lie. Let's start with a look at the governors, the traditional launching pad of presidential ambitions.
Among the Republican ranks is Brian Sandoval, the Hispanic governor of Nevada. The 49-year-old former federal judge took on a corrupt conservative incumbent and is now racking up an impressive reform record in his first term. Likewise, there is New Mexico's Gov. Susana Martinez, a former district attorney who remains popular in her state despite an otherwise Democratic tide.
Sen. Tim Scott was appointed last year, representing South Carolina.
Ted Cruz celebrates his victory in U.S. Senate race in Texas.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is considered a presidential contender for 2016.
Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is thought to be a potential presidential contender.
Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina is of Indian-American descent. Republican Brian Sandoval is the Hispanic governor of Nevada. How many Hispanic governors do the Democrats have in office? Zero.
Attracting minority voters a key GOP goal
America's Indian-American population is fast-growing and successful. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is one of the nation's most innovative governors, and the former Rhodes scholar is newly committed to making the GOP no longer "the party of stupid."
If he chooses to run for president in 2016, Jindal could make a major dent in the race and possibly emerge toward the front of the pack. There is also South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who climbed from the General Assembly to the Governor's Mansion, breaking a number of historical barriers along the way. In the past two months, she has appointed the first African-American Republican from the South to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction (Tim Scott), and her husband was deployed to Afghanistan.
How many Indian-American governors do Democrats have in office? None.
Now let's move over the U.S. Senate.
The aforementioned Scott just was tapped by Haley to finish out Sen. Jim DeMint's term, making the former congressman the first African-American Republican senator serving since Ed Brooke of Massachusetts in the 1970s. He is also the only black senator of either party.
Likewise, the GOP is looking at two young new Hispanic stars in the Senate chamber -- Florida's Marco Rubio and the newly elected Ted Cruz from Texas. Interestingly, both men are of Cuban descent.
Presidential buzz surrounded Rubio almost from the moment he entered office after defeating the sitting governor, Charlie Crist, in a contentious primary. He has put forward an innovative immigration reform proposal in recent weeks, which could help shape national debate, and he's already decamped to Iowa to speak at a political dinner.
Cruz is a former member of the Harvard Law Review who donned the tea party mantle to defeat a powerful sitting lieutenant governor in a primary. He was born in Canada to an American mother, a fact that hasn't stopped the fast-forward presidential projection. At the very least, Cruz will be a real force in the Senate for decades to come.
On the Democratic side, the only Hispanic senator is New Jersey's Robert Menendez. While in line for the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee, he has been beset by ethical allegations for much of his career, most recently the accusation that federal agents held off from arresting an office intern who was also an undocumented immigrant and registered sex offender until after Menendez's re-election. (Menendez has said he didn't know about any possible delay.)
Menendez might have influence, but he is not a charismatic figure. That's why the Democratic National Convention chose to highlight San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro at its keynote, rather than anyone more senior or nationally known.
Bennett: At convention, GOP leaders reflect U.S. diversity
The Republicans' surprising diversity edge when it comes to statewide elected officials cannot erase the very real diversity deficit they face below this level. In the House of Representatives, often called "The People's House," the disparity is stark.
The new 113th Congress is the most diverse in history, but that diversity comes almost exclusively courtesy of the Democratic side of the aisle. For example, there are 42 African-American members of the House -- all are Democrats. The Hispanic population is comparatively less skewed, with 27 congressional Democrats and eight Republicans. Among Asian-Americans, we're back to the lopsided totals -- 11 Democrats and no Republicans.
Watts: Diversity good for God and GOP
It is a historical irony and a barely slumbering scandal that the Party of Lincoln lost its edge on diversity in pursuit of short-term political gain by realigning the Southern states of the former Confederacy in the wake of the Civil Rights bills that conservatives such as Barry Goldwater believed were unconstitutional. The times when Martin Luther King Jr.'s father, like millions of other African-Americans, was automatically a Republican are a distant memory.
But Democrats should not rest on their laurels after Obama. Their lack of statewide-elected diverse Democrats is striking and could provide an opening for Republicans in the next generation (if conservatives don't keep alienating that community with anti-immigrant rhetoric and legislation).
The old stereotypes don't hold when looking at the facts -- Republicans have been quietly making inroads into communities of color, even if that hasn't yet registered in overall voting patterns. And rising Republican stars such as Rubio, Jindal, Sandoval, Scott, Haley, Cruz and Martinez are reasons for optimism as we look toward the future of American politics.

Cartoons that scare Syria's leader
By John D. Sutter, CNN
updated 7:29 AM EDT, Tue May 21, 2013
Syrian political cartoonist Ali Ferzat, shown earlier this month at the Oslo Freedom Forum, says pens have the power to topple dictators. The self-taught artist has mocked authority since he was a young boy.
Ferzat was attacked in Damascus in 2011. His hands were broken so that he wouldn't be able to draw again, he said. The cartoonist left the country to get needed medical treatment.
The artist, who now lives outside Syria, protests the violence in April 2012. He remains optimistic about the torn nation's future.
Initially, Ferzat's cartoons depicted nameless people. Over time, he started drawing identifiable images of Syrian leaders to mock them directly.
Ferzat began drawing at a relatively young age. His cartoons have been published internationally. He's convinced he will return to his country one day.
Ferzat said this image led to him being attacked in Syria in 2011. It shows Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad trying to hitchhike out of the country with Libya's former leader, Moammar Gadhafi.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Syrian political cartoonist details 2011 attack in which his hands were broken
John Sutter: Ali Ferzat's story offers hope for the Syrian revolution He says meeting Ferzat is the 'human-rights-nerd version of a basketball fan meeting LeBron'
Sutter: 'Ferzat's hands are some of the most feared objects in Syria'
Editor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist at CNN Opinion, covering human rights. E-mail him at CTL@CNN.com or follow him on Twitter (@jdsutter), Facebook or Google+.
Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The masked henchmen grabbed three fingers on each of the Syrian political cartoonist's hands and pulled them back all the way -- so far that they cracked.
"Break his arms so that he doesn't ever draw again," one said.
Ali Ferzat -- the cartoonist who described the 2011 attack to me in a recent interview -- soon found himself bleeding and left for dead near the Damascus airport. His assailants, who he believes were acting on behalf of the Syrian regime, dragged him alongside a moving car. His head and shoulder bounced on the pavement and then the men shoved him out of the vehicle, dumping him on the side of the road.
Ferzat wondered if he would live, let alone draw again.
It would be months before he would learn the second answer.
John D. Sutter
Before I'd heard these and the other horrifying details of this attack against one of the Arab world's most notable artists, I asked Ferzat -- an Arab-Santa-looking character with a smile that could cheer up Tilda Swinton -- if he was sure his hands were broken to stop him from drawing cartoons critical of Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad.
His answer made me laugh.
"Obviously," he said. "What do I look like to you, a chef?"

Saving Syria's heart
I met Ferzat in at the Oslo Freedom Forum, a gathering of dissidents and human rights activists, where he received the Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent. Being in his presence was the human-rights nerd version of a basketball fan meeting LeBron. But what impressed me most about Ferzat is that he's maintained his wit and cheer despite the darkness that has fallen on him and on his country, which is in the grips of an intractable two-year war that's killed an estimated 80,000 people.
He is almost naively optimistic about Syria's future. And it's infectious. The rest of Syria's opposition should take note. As his story shows, the true strength of a revolution is in its ideas -- in nonviolent actions such as drawing truth to power.
Dictators do have reason to be scared of cartoons.
That's why Ferzat's hands became some of the most feared objects in Syria.
"They came after me," he said. "Obviously (cartooning) has power."
The self-taught artist, who's in his early 60s, has been using them to mock authority since he was a young boy -- first imitating cartoons he admired and then creating satire of his own. He went pro in the 1970s, gaining notoriety for publishing cartoons domestically and internationally. Back then, before the current war, Ferzat never dared to depict specific people in his cartoons. He drew autocrats and dictators, but they never looked like real, identifiable people. He did it to avoid censorship or retaliation.
But that was before the war -- before reports emerged, in May 2011, that a 13-year-old had been tortured and killed in Daraa, Syria. Stories like those of Hamza Ali al-Khateeb's death, which reportedly involved his genitals being mutilated, pushed Ferzat across a threshold. He started to draw exact likeness of al-Assad in his satire. Enough was enough.
His pen would hold no punches.
Ferzat drew al-Assad standing on the side of the road with his thumb in the air, ready to hitchhike out of Syria. A crazed Moammar Gadhafi, who was still alive at the time but later would be killed in Libya's uprising, was driving a getaway car.
The message was clear: Syria's leader had to go.
That was the image, he told me, that led to his attack on August 25, 2011. Ferzat's animated demeanor -- his eyebrows bounce when he talks and his hands, now unbandaged, gesture wildly -- flattened as he told me the story.
That day, a white car with darkly tinted windows followed him out of the studio before dawn. He's been working there by candlelight to avoid detection. Frightened by the car, he drove to the center of Damascus, to a square he knew to be home to government buildings and the president's palace. The car followed and crashed into him at the square, he said, forcing him stop. Three men emerged and yanked off the doors of Ferzat's car. They pulled him from it, beat him with crowd-control batons and then yanked plastic handcuffs around his wrists.
"They handcuffed me so tightly I felt that one of my wrists was going to break," he said.
SANA, the Syrian state news agency, reported Ferzat "was attacked by veiled people" and that "authorities concerned are conducting an investigation." My e-mail requesting further information, however, was not responded to. And the U.S. State Department condemned the attack, saying in a statement that the al-Assad regime was sending "a clear message that (Ferzat) should stop drawing."
They beat him so badly that his vision failed for days in one eye, Farzat told me, and he could barely see out of the other. Confused, Ferzat asked what was happening to him.
"Don't you ever dare to cross your bosses and to cross your leaders, because Bashar al-Assad's shoe is on your face and on your head." (For evidence of the severity of that insult, recall the Bush and Ahmadinejad shoe-throwing incidents).
They drove 30 minutes to a road near the Damascus airport. That's where they threw him from the car.
"My white shirt was completely, totally, red from the blood," he said.
He thought he surely would bleed to death there. Cars wouldn't stop, perhaps afraid to pick up a person targeted by the regime or by police. But then the first of three miracles happened: A truck's tire burst, forcing it to stop exactly in front of Ferzat.
"This is like something out of a freakin' movie," Amir Ahmad Nasr, a blogger-author friend who was translating the conversation from Arabic, said to me.
Ferzat threw himself into the bed of the pickup and begged the three men who drove it to take him back to the city. They agreed to drop him at the gates of Damascus, but wouldn't take him further -- definitely not to a hospital -- for fear of being targeted themselves. Still bleeding and barely able to see because of the beatings to his head, Ferzat wandered up to a house and asked its guard for help.
Then the second miracle: The guard agreed to give him a ride to a nearby clinic, where (here's the third) doctors recognized the cartoonist and were sympathetic to his cause.
They treated him at his house to avoid detection. But there was always the worry: his hands. Would he draw again?
"My hands became stuck like this," he told me, tensing up his digits into a wooden, claw-like shape. "The doctors told me I needed to get treatment overseas."
Fate, again, would intervene. Using a newspaper contact in Kuwait, Ferzat arranged to leave Syria and seek treatment in a hospital there. After six months of surgery and physical therapy, he was able to put pen to paper.
The first cartoon he created after the attack was not diluted by fear. He drew al-Assad and Russia's Vladimir Putin walking side by side, their legs intertwined to make the shape of a Nazi swastika.
Ferzat is still living in exile. But the revolution needs him. It needs his art. He's seen images of protesters and rebels carrying printouts of his drawings. So he contributes art from outside the country.
The outcome of the war in Syria is anything but sure. But talk to Ferzat and his optimism will rub off on you. He's convinced he will live and draw in Syria again -- that people in his country, a cradle of civilization that invented one of the world's first alphabets, are no longer afraid and eventually will triumph over the regime that would crush their spirits and their art.
After hearing his story, I'm hard-pressed not to believe him.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Magnified image of marine plankton wins Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition
The annual contest draws entries from scientists and photographers alike
View through the microscope is like "exploring space," says winning photographer
Previous entries include a mosquito's heart, a flea's head and a pregnant aphid
(CNN) -- A magnified image of marine plankton has won a prestigious international photography contest for tiny works that exist, in the words of the winning photographer, in the "limbo between art and science."
Wim van Egmond, a freelance photographer from the Netherlands, took the top prize in the annual Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition, for his magnified image of marine plankton.
It was the 11th year he had entered the contest, which draws entries from professional photographers as well as scientists, who generally produce the images in the course of their work. The winning entries are judged on their scientific and artistic merits.

"For 20 years, I've been looking through a microscope, and every time I see things I haven't seen before," said van Egmond, who has had 19 images recognized as finalists in the competition over the past decade. "It's such an endless world -- there are so many species and so many different life stages of these organisms. It's all so strange and wonderful that it's become a bit of an addiction."
The view through the microscope was like "exploring a different world, or exploring space, with these strange unknown organisms," he said.
Recognized as one of the contest's top photomicrographers, Van Egmond runs a website devoted to photomicrography called the Micropolitan Museum. He said he approached his subjects as if he were producing a portrait, trying to "capture their personalities."
"I don't invent things, I try to make it as naturalistic as possible, but these organisms are such a strange shape that it almost looks like an abstract painting," he said. "You don't have to make much of an effort to make something that is weird."
He had long been intrigued by the Chaetoceros debilis, a plant-like plankton with a corkscrew form and bristles. "It's very hard to capture because it's so 3-dimensional and so fragile. It was a bit of a challenge to make a good portrait of the organism."
The winning entry was created using software to combine various images focusing on different areas of the plankton. "The difficulty of microscopy is that when you have a ... magnification of an image, you have hardly any depth of field," he said. By combining images where some areas were in focus and others were blurred, he could create a 3-dimensional effect, he said.
Previous entries in the contest, now in its 39th year, have included a mosquito's heart, a flea's head, and a pregnant aphid.

Shrewd guardian of the Deng legacy
Jiang Zemin has emerged as China's principal leader. He is president, the head of the military and general secretary of the Communist Party.
Jiang Zemin (1926- )
"We will work to establish a fairly ideal socialist market economy."
(CNN) -- With his thick glasses and bland demeanor, Jiang Zemin seems at first glance a dull bureaucrat. Behind the scenes, however, he is a shrewd survivor, a veteran of the epic leadership battles in the Chinese Communist Party and an economic reformer intent on shaking up China's massive state-run industries.
Jiang grew up under Japanese occupation in Yangzhou city northwest of Shanghai. The war with the Japanese had a profound effect on his life. When an uncle, a Communist partisan, was killed in combat, Jiang's father gave his son to the uncle's family so they would have a male heir. Jiang's status as the adopted son of a revolutionary martyr would open doors for him throughout his career.
As a young man, Jiang worked as an engineer and did a brief stint at a Soviet automobile plant in the 1950s. He was later tapped for government service and rose steadily through the bureaucratic ranks, advancing through a series of ministerial posts before being named mayor of Shanghai in 1985.
Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Critics dismissed him as a "flower vase," a Chinese term for a decorative but useless person. Others lauded him for transforming Shanghai into a cosmopolitan city and luring a steady stream of venture capital from Hong Kong, Japan and the West.
Willing to debate human rights
Jiang was made a full member of the Politburo in 1987, and two years later he won the favor of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, by supporting the suppression of the student-led pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square.

In the reshuffle that followed the crackdown, Jiang took on the titles of general secretary of the Communist Party and chairman of the Central Military Commission and, later, president of the People's Republic of China. He assumed many of the daily operations of government during the years of Deng's declining health, and later emerged at the center of the so-called "collective leadership" that rose to prominence after Deng's death in 1997.
In the years since Tiananmen, Jiang has combined a steadfast defense of the government's actions with a willingness to engage with the West in the debate over human rights.
In June 1998 he took the unprecedented step of holding a live televised debate with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Beijing.
Jiang listened intently to Clinton's sometimes biting criticism of China's treatment of dissidents and minorities. When it was his turn to speak, Jiang fired back that China's response to the Tiananmen protests was justified.
"Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today," he said.
'I wish you good trading'
Jiang's high-level exchanges with U.S. officials have given him a chance to shine on the international stage and indulge his interest in American culture and technology.
During a visit to the United States in 1997, Jiang gave a speech at Harvard University, played host at a banquet for corporate executives and even rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, calling out, "Good morning. I wish you good trading!" to the teeming hordes on the stock market floor. Jiang hugs Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a Beijing visit in 1997
He quoted sections of the Gettysburg Address during a tour of the White House and revealed to Clinton that he knew all the dialogue from the John Wayne movie, "Stagecoach" (Jiang's English teacher used the script as a teaching tool).
Jiang has always been keen to modernize the Chinese economy. At the 15th Communist Party Congress in September 1997 he unveiled a sweeping plan to privatize China's massive and unprofitable state-owned enterprises. Though the plan was cloaked in revolutionary language, its underlying intent was clear: to open Chinese markets to more international investment.
"Between now and the end of the first decade of the next century," he said during his U.S. visit the next month, "we will work to establish a fairly ideal socialist market economy."
Jiang has faced periodic challenges to his leadership within the Communist Party. Each time the wily septuagenarian has managed to outmaneuver his rivals. He had the powerful former mayor of Beijing expelled for corruption in 1995, and two years later engineered the early retirement of two generals and the head of the National People's Congress.
He shows every sign of carrying on the legacy of his mentor, Deng, pursuing a vigorous program of market reforms and keeping a lid on political pluralism and internal dissent.

4. Harold Ickes Mr. Ickes, a former Deputy Chief of Staff,(458) also related to
the grand jury a conversation that he had with the President on
the morning of January 26, 1998,(460) during which the President
denied the Lewinsky allegations. Regarding that conversation, Mr. Ickes testified: "The two
things that I recall, the two things that he again repeated in
public -- had already said publicly and repeated in public that
same Monday morning was that he had not had -- he did not have a
-- or he had not had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
that he had done nothing -- now I'm paraphrasing -- had done
nothing to ask anybody to change their story or suborn perjury or
obstruct justice."(461) Mr. Ickes recalled that the President probably volunteered
this information.(462) Mr. Ickes repeated the President's false
statements to the grand jury.
B. The President's Grand Jury Testimony
The President admitted to the grand jury that, after the
allegations were publicly reported, he made "misleading"
statements to particular aides whom he knew would likely be
called to testify before the grand jury. The President testified
as follows:
Q:	Do you recall denying any sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky to the following people: Harry
Thomasson, Erskine Bowles, Harold Ickes,
Mr. Podesta, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Jordan, Ms. Betty
Currie? Do you recall denying any sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky to those
individuals?
WJC:	I recall telling a number of those people that I
didn't have, either I didn't have an affair with
Monica Lewinsky or didn't have sex with her. And
I believe, sir, that -- you'll have to ask them
what they thought. But I was using those terms in
the normal way people use them. You'll have to
ask them what they thought I was saying.
Q:	If they testified that you denied sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, or if they told
us that you denied that, do you have any reason to
doubt them, in the days after the story broke; do
you have any reason to doubt them?
WJC:	No.
The President then was specifically asked whether he knew
that his aides were likely to be called before the grand jury.
Q:	It may have been misleading, sir, and you knew
though, after January 21st when the Post article
broke and said that Judge Starr was looking into
this, you knew that they might be witnesses. You
knew that they might be called into a grand jury,
didn't you?
WJC:	That's right. I think I was quite careful what I
said after that. I may have said something to all
these people to that effect, but I'll also --
whenever anybody asked me any details, I said,
look, I don't want you to be a witness or I turn
you into a witness or give you information that
would get you in trouble. I just wouldn't talk. I, by and large, didn't talk to people about this. Q:	If all of these people -- let's leave out Mrs.
Currie for a minute. Vernon Jordan, Sid
Blumenthal, John Podesta, Harold Ickes, Erskine
Bowles, Harry Thomasson, after the story broke,
after Judge Starr's involvement was known on
January 21st, have said that you denied a sexual
relationship with them. Are you denying that?
WJC:	No.
Q:	And you've told us that you --
WJC:	I'm just telling you what I meant by it. I told
you what I meant by it when they started this
deposition.
Q:	You've told us now that you were being careful,
but that it might have been misleading. Is that
correct?
WJC:	It might have been. . . . So, what I was trying
to do was to give them something they could --
that would be true, even if misleading in the
context of this deposition, and keep them out of
trouble, and let's deal -- and deal with what I
thought was the almost ludicrous suggestion that I
had urged someone to lie or tried to suborn
perjury, in other words.(463) C. Summary The President made the following misleading statements to
his aides:
The President told Mr. Podesta that he had
not engaged in sex "in any way whatsoever"
with Ms. Lewinsky, "including oral sex". The President told Mr. Podesta, Mr. Bowles, and
Mr. Ickes that he did not have a "sexual
relationship" with Ms. Lewinsky.
The President told Mr. Podesta that "when
[Ms. Lewinsky] came by, she came by to see
Betty [Currie]."
The President told Mr. Blumenthal that
Ms. Lewinsky "came on to him and that he had
told her he couldn't have sexual relations
with her and that she threatened him." The President told Mr. Blumenthal that he
couldn't remember making any calls to
Ms. Lewinsky other than once when he left a
message on her answering machine.
During the President's grand jury testimony, the President
admitted that his statements to aides denying a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky "may have been misleading."(464) The
President also knew his aides likely would be called to testify
regarding any communications with him about Ms. Lewinsky. And he
presumably expected his aides to repeat his statements regarding
Ms. Lewinsky to all questioners, including to the grand jury. Finally, he himself refused to testify for many months. The
combination of the President's silence and his deception of his
aides had the effect of presenting a false view of events to the
grand jury.
The President says that at the time he spoke to his aides,
he chose his words with great care so that, in his view, his
statements would be literally true because he was referring only
to intercourse. That explanation is undermined by the
President's testimony before the grand jury that his denials "may
have been misleading" and by the contradictory testimony by the
aides themselves -- particularly John Podesta, who says that the
President specifically denied oral sex with Ms. Lewinsky. Moreover, on January 24, 1998, the White House issued talking
points for its staff, and those talking points refute the
President's literal truth argument: The talking points state as
the President's view the belief that a relationship that includes
oral sex is "of course" a "sexual relationship."(465)
For all of these reasons, there is substantial and credible
information that the President improperly tampered with witnesses
during the grand jury investigation. XI.	There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton's actions since January 17, 1998, regarding his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky have been inconsistent
with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully
execute the laws.
Before, during, and after his January 17, 1998, civil
deposition, the President attempted to conceal the truth about
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the judicial process in
the Jones case. Furthermore, the President has since lied under
oath to the grand jury and facilitated the provision of false
information to the grand jury by others.
The President also misled the American people and the
Congress in his public statement of January 26, 1998, in which he
denied "sexual relations" with Ms. Lewinsky. The President
misled his Cabinet and his senior aides by denying the
relationship to them. The Cabinet and senior aides in turn
misled the American people and the Congress by conveying the
President's denials and professing their belief in the
credibility of those denials. The President promised in January 1998 to cooperate fully
with the grand jury investigation and to provide "more rather
than less, sooner rather than later." At that time, the OIC was
conducting a criminal investigation and was obligated to report
to Congress any substantial and credible information that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment. The President's conduct delayed the grand jury investigation
(and thereby delayed any potential congressional proceedings). He asserted, appealed, withdrew, and reasserted Executive
Privilege (and asserted other governmental privileges never
before applied in federal criminal proceedings against the
government). The President asserted these privileges concerning
the investigation of factual questions about which the President
already knew the answers. The President refused six invitations
to testify voluntarily before the grand jury. At the same time,
the President's aides and surrogates argued publicly that the
entire matter was frivolous and that any investigation of it
should cease. After being subpoenaed in July, the President made false
statements to the grand jury on August 17, 1998. That night, the
President again made false statements to the American people and
Congress, contending that his answers in his civil deposition had
been "legally accurate." The President then made an implicit
plea for Congress to take no action: "Our country has been
distracted by this matter for too long."(466)
The President has pursued a strategy of (i) deceiving the
American people and Congress in January 1998, (ii) delaying and
impeding the criminal investigation for seven months, and
(iii) deceiving the American people and Congress again in August
1998. A.	Beginning on January 21, 1998, the President misled the
American people and Congress regarding the truth of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.	On January 21, 1998, the day the Washington Post first
reported the Lewinsky matter, the President talked to his long-time advisor Dick Morris. With the President's approval,
Mr. Morris commissioned a poll that evening. The results
indicated that voters were willing to forgive the President for
adultery but not for perjury or obstruction of justice.(467) When
the President telephoned him that evening, Mr. Morris explained
that the President thus should not go public with a confession or
explanation.(468) According to Mr. Morris, the President replied,
"Well, we just have to win, then."(469) The next evening, the President dissuaded Mr. Morris from
any plan to "blast[] Monica Lewinsky 'out of the water.'" The
President indicated that "there's some slight chance that she may
not be cooperating with Starr and we don't want to alienate
her."(470) The President himself spoke publicly about the matter
several times in the initial days after the story broke. On
January 26, the President was definitive: "I want to say one
thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm
going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with
that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a
single time. Never. These allegations are false."(471)
The President's emphatic denial to the American people was
false. And his statement was not an impromptu comment in the
heat of a press conference. To the contrary, it was an
intentional and calculated falsehood to deceive the Congress and
the American people.(472)
B.	The First Lady, the Cabinet, the President's staff, and the
President's associates relied on and publicly emphasized the
President's denial.
After the President lied to the American people, the
President's associates argued that the allegations against the
President were false and even scurrilous. Mrs. Clinton forcefully denied the allegations on January
27, 1998, one day after the President's public denial. She
admitted that the American people "should certainly be concerned"
if a President had an affair and lied to cover it up. She
acknowledged that it would be a "very serious offense." But she
emphasized that the allegations were false -- a "pretty bad"
smear. She noted that the President "has denied these
allegations on all counts, unequivocally." And Mrs. Clinton
shifted the focus away from the President, indicated that "this
is a battle" and stated that "some folks are going to have a lot
to answer for" when the facts come out.(473)
The most senior officials in the Executive Branch served as
additional (albeit unwitting) agents of the President's
deception. The Cabinet and White House aides stated emphatically
that the allegations were false. For example, White House
spokesperson Michael McCurry was asked whether the President's
denial covered all forms of sexual contact, and Mr. McCurry
stated that "I think every American that heard him knows exactly
what he meant."(474) So, too, White House Communications Director
Ann Lewis said on January 26, 1998: "I can say with absolute
assurance the President of the United States did not have a
sexual relationship because I have heard the President of the
United States say so. He has said it, he could not be more
clear. He could not have been more direct."(475) She added: "Sex
is sex, even in Washington. I've been assured."(476) After a Cabinet meeting on January 23, 1998, in which the
President offered denials, several members of the Cabinet
appeared outside the White House. Secretary of State Albright
stated: "I believe that the allegations are completely
untrue."(477) Coupled with the President's firm denial, the united
front of the President's closest advisors helped shape perception
of the issue. C.	The President repeatedly and unlawfully invoked the
Executive Privilege to conceal evidence of his personal
misconduct from the grand jury.
When the allegations about Ms. Lewinsky first arose, the
President informed the American people that he would cooperate
fully. He told Jim Lehrer that "we are doing our best to
cooperate here."(478) He told National Public Radio that "I have
told people that I would cooperate in the investigation, and I
expect to cooperate with it. . . . I'm going to do my best to
cooperate with the investigation."(479) He told Roll Call "I'm
going to cooperate with this investigation. . . . And I'll
cooperate."(480) Such cooperation did not occur. The White House's approach
to the constitutionally based principle of Executive Privilege
most clearly exposed the non-cooperation. In 1994, White House
Counsel Lloyd Cutler issued an opinion that the Clinton
Administration would not invoke Executive Privilege for cases
involving personal wrongdoing by any government official.(481) By
1998, however, the President had blended the official and
personal dimensions to the degree that the President's private
counsel stated in a legal brief filed in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: "In a very real
and significant way, the objectives of William J. Clinton, the
person, and his Administration (the Clinton White House) are one
and the same."(482) After the Monica Lewinsky investigation began, the President
invoked Executive Privilege for the testimony of five witnesses:
Bruce Lindsey, Cheryl Mills, Nancy Hernreich, Sidney Blumenthal,
and Lanny Breuer. These claims were patently groundless. Even
for official communications within the scope of the privilege,
the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1974 in United States v.
Nixon(483) that the Executive Privilege gives way in the face of the
compelling need for evidence in criminal proceedings.
The President's assertion of Executive Privilege for
Ms. Hernreich, an assistant who manages the secretarial work for
the Oval Office,(484) was frivolous. At the time that the President
was asserting Executive Privilege for one assistant, the
President's other assistant (Betty Currie) had already testified
extensively. Based on Nixon, the OIC filed a motion to compel the
testimony of Hernreich, Lindsey, and Blumenthal. The United
States District Court held a hearing on March 20. Just before
the hearing, the White House -- without explanation -- dropped
its Executive Privilege claim as to Ms. Hernreich.(485) On May 4, 1998, Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled
against the President on the Executive Privilege issue.(486) After
the White House filed a notice of appeal, the OIC filed an
expedited petition for certiorari before judgment in the Supreme
Court. The President thereupon dropped his claim of Executive
Privilege.
The tactics employed by the White House have not been
confined to the judicial process. On March 24, while the
President was traveling in Africa, he was asked about the
assertion of Executive Privilege. He responded, "You should ask
someone who knows." He also stated "I haven't discussed that
with the lawyers. I don't know."(487) This was untrue. Unbeknownst to the public, in a
declaration filed in District Court on March 17 (seven days
before the President's public expression of ignorance), White
House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff informed Chief Judge Johnson that
he "ha[d] discussed" the matter with the President, who had
directed the assertion of Executive Privilege.(488) The deception has continued. Because the President withdrew
his Executive Privilege claim while the case was pending in the
Supreme Court of the United States, it was assumed that the
President would no longer assert Executive Privilege. But that
assumption proved incorrect. White House attorney Lanny Breuer
appeared before the grand jury on August 4, 1998, and invoked
Executive Privilege. He would not answer, for example, whether
the President had told him about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and whether they had discussed the gifts he had given to
Monica Lewinsky.(489) On August 11, 1998, Chief Judge Johnson
denied the Executive Privilege claim as a basis for refusing to
testify, and ordered Mr. Breuer to testify.(490) On August 11, 1998, Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills
testified and repeatedly asserted Executive Privilege at the
President's direction.(491) The breadth of the claim was striking: The privilege was asserted not only for Ms. Mills's
communications with the President, senior staff, and staff
members of the White House Counsel's Office -- but also for
Ms. Mills's communications with private lawyers for the
President, private lawyers for grand jury witnesses, and Betty
Currie.(492)
On August 17, the President testified before the grand jury. At the request of a grand juror, the OIC asked the President
about his assertions of Executive Privilege and why he had
withdrawn the claim before the Supreme Court. The President
replied that "I didn't really want to advance an executive
privilege claim in this case beyond having it litigated, so that
we, we had not given up on principal [sic] this matter, without
having some judge rule on it. . . . I strongly felt we should
not appeal your victory on the executive privilege issue."(493)
Four days after this sworn statement, on August 21, 1998,
the President filed a notice of appeal with respect to the
Executive Privilege claim for Lanny Breuer that Chief Judge
Johnson had denied ten days earlier (and six days before the
President's testimony). In addition, Bruce Lindsey appeared
again before the grand jury on August 28, 1998, and the President
again asserted Executive Privilege with respect to his testimony
-- even though the President had dropped the claim of Executive
Privilege for Mr. Lindsey while the case was pending before the
Supreme Court of the United States in June.(494) The Executive Privilege was not the only claim of privilege
interposed to prevent the grand jury from gathering relevant
information. The President also acquiesced in the Secret
Service's attempt to have the Judiciary craft a new protective
function privilege (rejecting requests by this Office that the
President order the Secret Service officers to testify). The
District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit rejected the privilege claim. The litigation
was disruptive to the Secret Service and to the grand jury. The
frivolity of the claim is evidenced by the Chief Justice's
decision to reject the Secret Service's request for a stay
without even referring the matter to the full Court. All of that
litigation would have been unnecessary had the President
testified in February instead of August, or had he taken the
position that relevant facts should be fully available to the
grand jury. D.	The President refused six invitations to testify to the
grand jury, thereby delaying expeditious resolution of this
matter, and then refused to answer relevant questions before
the grand jury when he testified in August 1998. >This Office extended six separate invitations to the
President to testify before the grand jury. The first invitation
was issued on January 28, 1998. The OIC repeated the invitations
on behalf of the grand jury on February 4, February 9, February
21, March 2, and March 13. The President declined each
invitation. His refusals substantially delayed this Office's
investigation.
Finally, in the face of the President's actions, this Office
asked the grand jury to consider issuing a subpoena to the
President. The grand jury deliberated and approved the issuance
of a subpoena. On July 17, 1998, the OIC served the subpoena, in
accordance with the grand jury's action, on the President's
private counsel. The subpoena required the President to appear
on July 28. The President sought to delay his testimony.(495) Shortly
after a hearing before the District Court on the President's
motion for a continuance, the President and the OIC reached an
agreement by which the President would testify on August 17 via
live video feed to the grand jury. In a Rose Garden ceremony on
July 31, 1998, the President stated to the country: "I'm looking
forward to the opportunity . . . of testifying. I will do so
completely and truthfully."(496)
At the outset of his grand jury appearance, the President
similarly stated: "I will answer each question as accurately and
fully as I can."(497) The President then read a prepared statement
in which he admitted "inappropriate intimate contact" with
Ms. Lewinsky.(498) Despite his statement that he would answer each
question, the President refused to answer specific questions
about that contact (other than to indicate that it was not
intercourse and did not involve the direct touching of
Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or genitals).(499) E. The President misled the American people and the Congress in
his public statement on August 17, 1998, when he stated that
his answers at his civil deposition in January had been
"legally accurate." The President addressed the Nation on the evening of August
17, 1998, after his grand jury appearance. The President did not
tell the truth. He stated: "As you know, in a deposition in
January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. While my answers were legally accurate, I did not
volunteer information."(500) As this Referral has demonstrated, the
President's statements in his civil deposition were not "legally
accurate," and he could not reasonably have thought they were.
They were deliberate falsehoods designed to conceal the truth of
the President's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The President's claim that his testimony during the civil
deposition was legally accurate -- which he made to the grand
jury and to the American people on August 17 -- perpetuates the
deception and concealment that has accompanied his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky since his first sexual encounter with her on
November 15, 1995.
F. Summary
In this case, the President made and caused to be made false
statements to the American people about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. He also made false statements about whether he had
lied under oath or otherwise obstructed justice in his civil
case. By publicly and emphatically stating in January 1998 that
"I did not have sexual relations with that woman" and these
"allegations are false," the President also effectively delayed a
possible congressional inquiry, and then he further delayed it by
asserting Executive Privilege and refusing to testify for six
months during the Independent Counsel investigation. This
represents substantial and credible information that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment.
1. The pseudonym Jane Doe was used during discovery to refer
to certain women whose identities were protected from the public.
2. For a discussion of the procedural background to the
Jones case, see Appendix, Tab C.
3. Sections 1621 and 1623 of Title 18 (perjury) carry a
penalty of imprisonment of not more than five years for knowingly
making a false, material statement under oath, including in any
ancillary court proceeding. An "ancillary proceeding" includes a
deposition in a civil case. United States v. McAfee, 8 F.3d
1010, 1013 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Scott, 682 F.2d 695,
698 (8th Cir. 1982). The perjury statutes apply to statements
made during civil proceedings. As one United States Court of
Appeals recently stated, "we categorically reject any suggestion,
implicit or otherwise, that perjury is somehow less serious when
made in a civil proceeding. Perjury, regardless of the setting,
is a serious offense that results in incalculable harm to the
functioning and integrity of the legal system as well as to
private individuals." United States v. Holland, 22 F.3d 1040,
1047 (11th Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Wilkinson, 137
F.3d 214, 225 (4th Cir. 1998).

federal civil cases by which a party serves written questions on
the opposing party. The rules require that they be answered
under oath and therefore under penalty of perjury. See Fed. R.

Interrogatories, see Interrogatory no. 10). The interrogatory in

limiting the scope of the question to cover only women who were
state or federal employees at the relevant times.

relationship," it adds detail to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony and
underscores the sexual and intimate nature of the relationship
between the President and Ms. Lewinsky.

messages on her home answering machine (although he told her he
did not like to leave messages). Ms. Lewinsky provided four
microcassettes of four messages to the OIC on July 29, 1998. FBI
