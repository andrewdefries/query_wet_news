Police links all three shooting deaths in Charleston, West Virginia.

CHARLESTON, West Virginia (CNN) -- Investigators said Friday that they have received more than 600 leads but appealed for even more in their quest to find the shooter or shooters responsible for the recent killings of three people outside area convenience stores.
"We need the public's help," said Ken McCabe, special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, division, which includes West Virginia.
Gary Carrier, 44, was shot dead August 10 outside a Go-Mart store on the west side of Charleston.
Jeanie Patton, 31, was killed about 10:30 p.m. August 14 at a Speedway filling station on Campbell Creek Road south of Charleston. About an hour later, Okey Meadows, 26, was fatally shot at a Go-Mart on U.S. 60 east of the city.
Authorities released a composite sketch Thursday night of a heavyset, goateed man who was reportedly seen behind the wheel of a dark pickup truck in the vicinity one of the August 14 shootings. McCabe urged anyone with information about the subject to call 866-989-2824 or 304-357-0169.
"We would like to identify this person," McCabe said. "You may remain anonymous."
"We just want to talk to him," another task force member said, referring to the man. "We don't know if he is the driver, the shooter or just someone who might be able to help us."
Authorities also want to talk with a tall, thin person "with what were described as hairy, white legs" who might have information regarding one of the August 14 shootings, McCabe said.
The man was connected to a light-colored truck, similar to the dark-colored one, that was seen in the vicinity of the shooting, about 18 hours before it occurred. "We do not believe he is a suspect," McCabe said.
Asked why the man was being sought, McCabe said, "To see if he has any information that could help us, having been seen in that area, and he drives a similar truck, and in order to eliminate him."
A task force of representatives from nearly 20 law enforcement agencies has been established to help solve the case, Sheriff Dave Tucker said.
"It consists of scores of agents and officers who are working on the cases 24 hours a day, seven days a week," he said. "It is committed to solving these crimes."
Callers have identified friends, acquaintances and at least one known criminal who might be the man in the drawing, task force investigators said. The response has encouraged them.
"This case is solvable," one task force investigator told CNN.
Also Friday, authorities carried out a crime-scene reconstruction at one of the convenience stores.
So far, authorities have suggested no motive, and it is not clear whether the killings were random.
McCabe gave little weight to suggestions by the Kanawha County Sheriff's Department that the killings might be connected to the drug trade.
"That is one of the avenues that is being investigated by the task force, as is all possible theories," he said.
Earlier, Charleston Mayor Danny Jones was even less supportive of a possible association.
"That has not been established by the task force," he told CNN. "That's the sheriff operating on his own theory, perhaps through his own department. The task force has not established that. Right now, it's so completely premature to say that."
Jones said police are assuming the shooter or shooters are in West Virginia.
"We have a lot of valleys, a lot of mountains, a lot of ridges," he said. "Somebody could hide here. But we have to operate on the theory that he is still in the area."
Fourth shooting investigated
Police also are investigating a shooting at a convenience store near Charleston late Wednesday that resembled the three fatal attacks in the area.
A teenage girl reported a shot fired at a Go-Mart in Dunbar, west of Charleston, at about 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, according to Dunbar police Capt. Randy Gillespie. She also said she saw a maroon, full-sized pickup approach the convenience store before she heard the shot.
No one was injured. Investigators say there is little to connect the fourth incident with the previous shootings, and they have found no sign that any building or vehicle was hit by the reported gunshot.

The killings have stunned residents of the Charleston area, raising fears of sniper attacks similar to those that terrorized the Washington area last year. Business at area convenience stores appears to have dropped, but other areas of the city's business community appear unaffected, Jones said.
"I think that things are somewhat normal."
As was the case in Washington, police have a plan to blockade possible escape routes in the event of a new shooting, task force investigators said.

'Star Wars' creator says laser too much like lightsaberBy Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets Lucasfilm Ltd. says this handheld laser is too similar to the famous lightsabers from the "Star Wars" series. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Lucasfilm Ltd. says handheld laser is too much like the lightsaber from "Star Wars" Wicked Lasers has been in business for seven years, says device isn't a knockoff Company has not compared its powerful laser to a lightsaber, but some blogs have Lucasfilm threatened legal action if laser isn't discontinued or changed RELATED TOPICS

(CNN) -- "Star Wars" creator George Lucas wants to force a laser company to stop making a new, high-powered product he says looks too much like the famous lightsaber from his classic sci-fi series. Lucasfilm Ltd. has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Hong Kong-based Wicked Lasers, threatening legal action if it doesn't change its Pro Arctic Laser series or stop selling it altogether. "It is apparent from the design of the Pro Arctic Laser that it was intended to resemble the hilts of our lightsaber swords, which are protected by copyright ... ," said the letter, dated last month and provided to CNN by Wicked Lasers. The letter calls the company's newest laser "a highly dangerous product with the potential to cause blindness, burns and other damage to people and/or property." Steve Liu, CEO of Wicked Lasers, said his 7-year-old company has been selling similar lasers for years and has never compared the product to the Jedi weapon wielded by Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and others in the "Star Wars" franchise. "Most people feel it's kind of ridiculous ...," he said. "We would never use any comparison like that to 'Star Wars' or a lightsaber or anything like that." He called the $199 gadget's design fairly typical for a handheld laser and said it isn't a copy of the lightsaber. "Lucasfilm shouldn't be saying something like that," he said. "They're a big company that needs to protect their trademarks. Maybe they're having to look like they're protecting their trademark in case they need to [protect it again] later." The cease-and-desist letter doesn't accuse Wicked of using the term "lightsaber" in its marketing -- which Liu said is primarily aimed at industrial, military and research customers. But it notes coverage from technology blogs that have frequently made that comparison. A headline from tech blog Gizmodo called the device "a real life lightsaber." The Daily Tech blog called it "perhaps the first consumer laser weapon" and said it "comes in sleek packaging that looks, unsurprisingly like a lightsaber." "These references make it clear that the public is being led to believe that the Pro Arctic Laser is an official lightsaber device and/or copied from our design," the Lucasfilm letter said. A Lucasfilm spokesman did not immediately respond to an e-mail request from CNN for additional comment. It's not the first time the company has sought help from the courts over perceived copyright threats to its lightsaber laser swords. In 2006, Lucasfilm filed suit against a Maryland-based company that produced lightsaber replicas, saying the products violated "Star Wars" trademarks. Liu acknowledged that his company's new Spyder III laser is dramatically stronger than lasers from the past. Wicked Lasers advertises it as "the world's most powerful portable laser." When coverage in the blogosphere increased orders, he said, Wicked altered the laser to add safety features. A safety lock feature prevents accidentally turning on the laser, and an extra lens reduces its power by 80 percent until it's removed. Every laser is shipped with safety goggles, he said. "You've got a lot of people who think this is kind of a cool toy, so we've decided not to ship the laser as it was originally advertised," he said. More than two weeks after receiving the letter from Lucasfilm, Wicked has not stopped selling or changed the laser. The letter asked for written assurance of changes within five business days or threatened "the initiation of legal proceedings without further notice to you." Liu said he hopes it doesn't come to that. "Personally, they're some of my favorite movies," he said.

Lebanon's unity government collapses as Hezbollah, allies quit By the CNN Wire Staff Someone will fill Lebanon's vacuumSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Obama meets with Hariri and denounces Hezbollah's actionsAn 11th minister resigns, causing the government to collapseThe row between Saad Hariri and Hezbollah is over a tribunal probe
RELATED TOPICS
Lebanon
Hezbollah
Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Members of the powerful Hezbollah movement and its allies brought down Lebanon's unity government Wednesday after resigning from Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Cabinet. Minister of State Adnan Sayyed Hussein turned in his resignation along with 10 members of the Hezbollah-led March 8 alliance, meaning that the threshold needed -- 11 resignations from the 30-member Cabinet -- to collapse the government had been reached. Hariri was meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House as the political crisis erupted in Lebanon. "The efforts by the Hezbollah-led coalition to collapse the Lebanese government only demonstrate their own fear and determination to block the government's ability to conduct its business and advance the aspirations of all of the Lebanese people," Obama said. Hariri next heads to Paris, where he is expected to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Hariri's office said. Lebanon's government has been at an impasse over the U.N.-backed special tribunal's investigation of the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the current premier's father. It is widely expected the tribunal will indict members of Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Doha, Qatar, for a Middle East forum, said the tribunal was on the verge of handing down indictments. "We view what happened today as a transparent effort by those forces inside Lebanon as well as interests outside Lebanon to subvert justice and undermine Lebanon's stability and progress," she said. Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the 2005 bombing that killed Hariri and has pressured the government to reject the tribunal's probe. Opposition member Fadi Abboud said the opposition bloc had been calling for a Cabinet session to discuss the tribunal and met Wednesday to discuss what action to take if their demands were not met. Attempts to resolve the dispute have failed so far. Hezbollah's walkout Wednesday came after a Saudi-Syrian initiative hit a dead end. In a statement issued before the resignations, Hariri said that "despite the developments in the last hours, we will by all means work to keep the doors open for the Lebanese to reach the solutions that ensure stability and calm and preserve national unity." Obama stressed to Hariri the importance of the tribunal's work "as a means to help end the era of political assassinations with impunity in Lebanon." The failure to break the impasse between Hariri's government and Hezbollah has raised fears of a renewal of the sectarian bloodshed that plagued Lebanon in 2008. Rafik Hariri's death stunned the nation and prompted tens of thousands to protest, blaming neighboring Syria for the killing. Syria has always denied the accusations. At the time of the bombing, Syria had immense political influence in Lebanon. A U.N. Security Council resolution demanded Damascus fully cooperate in the investigation. Eventually, the horrific events and the probe led to a complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon after 30 years of military presence.CNN's Nada Husseini and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Writer Bunmi Laditan is the woman behind The Honest Toddler feed on Twitter
Nearly 200,000 Twitter users follow the dry observations Laditan's alter ego
Her experiences with an ornery 2-year-old inspired The Honest Toddler
Laditan will release a book based on the Twitter account in May
(CNN) -- Ever wonder what your toddler would say about your homemade baby food if she had an acid tongue and a Twitter account?
Bunmi Laditan thinks she knows.
Laditan's tweeting alter ego, the Honest Toddler, has been making followers guffaw at the wry observations of a semi-fictional baby pundit for about a year now.
Laditan, a social media and online marketing manager based in Montreal, works from home so she can be with her children. She is set to release "The Honest Toddler: A Child's Guide to Parenting" in May.
Inspired by her spunky daughter, Tali, Laditan began a Twitter account that expressed what might really be going through her toddler's mind during a particularly tantrumy week.
"She had the ability to speak, but if she could fully articulate, what would she say?" Laditan wondered. Clearly, many of her nearly 200,000 Twitter followers would like to know the same thing and get a kick out of Laditan's interpretation.
CNN reached out to Laditan to find out why toddlers are so sassy, how Twitter fits into modern motherhood and what makes it all worthwhile.
An edited transcript of the talk is below:
Bunmi Laditan and her daughter Tali
CNN: What gave you the idea to do Honest Toddler?
Laditan: My 3-year old, who was 2 at the time, we were having a really hard time. I have an older child, I've been through the toddler stage before, but I think I blocked it out of my memory.
She was being defiant and I was busy with work, and literally it was the worst week we'd ever had. I just started (The Honest Toddler) for fun.
I was so surprised by the response. Not in a million years did I think a bunch of people would read it.
CNN: Working moms wear a lot of hats. What did you do before "supervising," as your book cover says, The Honest Toddler?
Laditan: I began in social media ... nowadays the first place you go, in terms of a really quick sense of community, is online. Just because it can be really hard to get in the car and find the mom group. It was difficult for me to navigate (being a mother). Wanting to read about motherhood, work-at-home moms, writer moms. Can I still have a career? How do I do it? How are other people managing?
Stay in touch!
Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.
So I began taking a real interest in the parents online, and since my background is in marketing, I really wanted to incorporate that in how I would earn an income from home. So I began doing social media for companies. One was "Tasty Baby," who made online organic baby food, and from there, I kept working and expanding and taking classes and working with other PR firms, learning how to do my job better.
I've always loved writing, but "I can love it, it's just not going to be my bread and butter," is how I always felt. But I wanted to keep writing, so I wrote for sites like "Mothering," "iVillage," "Huffington Post," and really just enjoyed it.
CNN: There seems to be a lot of very seriously toned parenting media on the Internet these days, and The Honest Toddler is anything but. Why do you think that is?
Laditan: I get that there has to be an authority source. I've been in that mode, too, when writing. I think it's about trying to regain control and trying to help people feel as if there is a how-to.
Even though at this point we all know there really isn't any one way. At one point or another you realize, there is no one way to do it, it's going to be messy, we can pretend all we want with our Instagrams and Facebook photos that it's all going great. But it's a struggle, so we do have to support each other and give each other a little bit of slack.
CNN: Honest Toddler is pretty unique with regards to the content on Twitter, too.
Laditan: I've seen Sarcastic Rover or when people tweet from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal, and I think they probably match up much closer to Honest Toddler than most parenting tweets. I think it's that different perspective.
One of the reasons I believe it's popular -- and I don't think it has anything to do with me or my writing ability or anything like that -- is it has to do with parents who have already wondered what their kids are trying to say. Who have already thought, I know, if my child had the ability to articulate, they would say something like that.
They have the opinions of people long before they have control of their bowels. They really believe we are on the same level. They believe we are peers. They see their mother and father as the ones who take care of them and where they go for comfort, but they really believe they have an equal vote.
CNN: That's a lot of sass for such a tiny human. Are toddlers sassy?
Laditan: Toddlers are ... people without filters. They're exactly like us but they don't have all the etiquette and social norms. So they say things that we would say if we didn't fear the social consequences.
CNN: How much of The Honest Toddler is rooted in the real life experiences of your children that you observe?
Laditan: Much of it is. I'm scared to say how much because I know that -- one of the reasons I love being anonymous is because that didn't feel like I would be judged. Not for my lack of parenting but just the situations are so crazy. And I know those situations happen to other people, too.
On Friday, I was tweeting about Tali's ear infection and going to the pediatrician's office. She told me right away, "I don't like the doctor." And I knew it was going to be a struggle.
CNN: At the end of the day, what makes a parent's struggle worth it?
Laditan: The number one thing that really makes it all OK is knowing that it won't last forever. When you contextualize any difficult experience, that's what makes it bearable.
With my first child, I had no idea what a contraction would feel like. Only what I'd seen on TV, like TLC, all these women screaming, 'I'm going to rip in half, this is going to be terrible!' But one woman (in a prenatal class), who had six kids said, 'You can handle 10 seconds of anything.' And she said the worst part of a contraction will probably last around 10 seconds.
And when I was actually in labor, I thought of that. Knowing that made it bearable.
It's the same thing when both my kids are still in their pajamas, crying, we're late for school, I'm thinking, "Great, now we're going to have to go to the secretary's office and she's going to see that they're late again and that I'm not dressed, and I have weird stuff in my eyes from sleeping so I obviously didn't wash my face or brush my teeth before I drove them there."
I'm thinking all those terrible things and then I think, "They're going to grow up and I'm not going to be doing any of this and I know I'm going to miss it, and they're going to want to be with their friends and not with me." So that's what makes it doable. That's what makes me able to appreciate it and be able to laugh about it.

YouTube confession: Sincere or slick manipulation?
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 10:11 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2013 | Filed under: Web
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Video confession raises questions about social sharing
Matthew Cordle confessed to drunken driving death in YouTube video
The viral post, with more than 1 million views, marks new wrinkle in criminal cases
Some speculate video was an effort to sway judge in the case
(CNN) -- Matthew Cordle hasn't yet been found liable of killing a man while drinking and driving, but there's not much question about whether he's guilty.
It's not because of the the homicide charges that were filed against him on Monday. But it's because Cordle went on YouTube last week and told the world he'd done just that.
Cordle's confession, a highly produced, three-and-a-half minute video that has been viewed by more than 1.2 million people, is the sort of pronouncement that would have been impossible before the world had social media platforms at its fingertips. And it's raising questions that go far beyond the 22-year-old Ohio man's guilt or innocence.
Chief among them: Was Cordle, who says he plans to plead guilty and accept whatever punishment is handed down, just trying to get a lighter sentence by using the Web to get out in front of a criminal case in which he hadn't even yet been charged?
DUI confessor charged Drunk driving confession goes viral
Video confession in court
DUI confession message: Don't be like me
On Flip the Media, a blog by students, faculty and alumni of the University of Washington's master's program in digital media, graduate Brook Ellingwood argues that parts of the video seem orchestrated to do just that.
"That he sees the video as a tactical move in a legal chess game is evident," Ellingwood writes, noting the way Cordle cites depression as a reason for his drinking.
And if it buys Cordle some sympathy from the court? Well, it's not farfetched to imagine others trying a similar tactic, he writes.
"We may well be in for a flurry of copycat videos as miscreants of all sorts try to duplicate what works in this one," wrote Ellingwood.
"One can imagine the appearance of less and less competent videos, resulting eventually in a criminal confession so ineptly scripted and produced that it becomes an ironically viral phenomenon in the manner of Rebecca Black's 'Friday'."
Cordle's attorney, George S. Breitmayer II, dismisses such speculation.
"Despite any speculation of his intentions, the video was meant to raise awareness related to the serious issues surrounding drinking and driving," he said in a statement sent to CNN.
But what does it mean for criminal justice -- a system that is designed to move deliberately -- that a new generation of young people can potentially influence the system by sharing something instantly with the entire world?
Alex Sheen is the founder of "Because I Said I Would," the website where Cordle's video began spreading. He's also the person who produced it, enhancing the raw footage with a swelling orchestral soundtrack and visual effects that make it look like a public service announcement.
He told CNN that Cordle was familiar with his site, on which people make public pledges to help them follow through with good deeds, and reached out to him with his story. Sheen said he didn't consider contacting police because he knew Cordle was already a suspect and that prosecutors were preparing charges.
A grand jury in Franklin County, Ohio, indicted Cordle on Monday on charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. He is charged in the death of Vince Canzani, 61, who was killed June 22 when a wrong-way driver hit his Jeep on Interstate 670 near Columbus, Ohio.
"The whole goal of this video is to convince people to not drink and drive -- to come to that realization that a lot of people make the same excuses that Matt makes in his life about drinking and driving," Sheen said. "To make that message compelling, we made this video."
Sheen calls Cordle's confession and plea for others to avoid drunken driving, "honorable." But he's pushed back against those on his site who have heaped praise upon the young man.
"While Matt certainly made an honorable decision to confess, Because I Said I Would does not believe that Matt should be praised as a 'hero,' " Sheen wrote on the site. "Matt made an irresponsible choice to drink and drive that ended an innocent man's life.
"Matt decided to release this video because he wants to raise awareness about the dangerous and irreversible consequences of drinking and driving. If that message is not heard ... if viewers do not make the commitment to never drink and drive, then the video has certainly failed in its mission."
He's got at least one perhaps unlikely believer.
"He ruined two lives," said Cheryl Oates, the victim's ex-wife. "He took Vince's life, and he ruined his life."
"It's gut-wrenching, coming from a mother, looking at that young boy," she said, saying she admired him for confessing so publicly. "You've got to respect him for that. I'm sorry. You do."
It's impossible to know the full measure of Cordle's motives. Was it self-interest? Sincere remorse? Perhaps some of both?
Ellingwood, now interactive director for a Seattle TV station, can envision it as part of a new, look-at-me world in which Internet celebrity is celebrated, regardless of the reason for it.
"Today, the only thing standing between any one of us and instant celebrity is our ability to create a message with resonance," he wrote.
"Cordle may view the death he caused as a personal opportunity, the mother of all Facebook timeline life events. He may lose a few years to prison, but he won the Internet and when he gets out, he'll have a chance to parlay this 15 minute shot of fame into a repeat. Only time will tell if his redemption story gets him onto 'Dancing With the Stars.' "

Jared Cohen
Young men watching popular American TV shows on satellite dishes. Young women wearing garish makeup. Teenagers sending secret text messages and arranging illicit trysts. These are perhaps scenarios you'd expect from a major U.S. city, not the images we normally see from the Middle East. These are some of the things Jared Cohen found when he set out to get the real story from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran. This young foreign policy force is responsible for public diplomacy, Muslim world outreach and North Africa at the U.S. State Department's Office of Policy Planning and, at 25 years old, has the experience to rival his veteran counterparts. Defying government orders, Cohen toured hostile Islamic regions to talk face-to-face with terrorists in an effort to debunk stereotypes and reveal a shocking subculture in his latest book, "Children of Jihad: A Young American's Travels Among the Youth of the Middle East."As a Jewish American, Cohen has guts. He went to Lebanon to interview Hezbollah members at, of all places, a McDonald's. In Iran, he found underground parties, where bootleg liquor, Western music and the Internet are all easy to access. His risky itinerary aims to show us how and why the under-30 generation in the Islamic world is the best hope for the West.Update: Watch the CNN.com Live Video interview

Visiting countries that have on numerous occassions murdered journalist is not worth the risk and is irresponsible.
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 6:18 AM ET "His risky itinerary aims to show us how and why the under-30 generation in the Islamic world is the best hope for the West."So, if they don't dress like me, listen to the same music like me, watch the same movies like me, then I am out of hope?Why is the American lifestyle the standard by which other people are judged by?Ofcourse, the assumption here is that anything Arabic or Islamic is bad, and everything Western and American is Good.Very simplistic worldview, that does nothing but enforce the idea that one people are superior to the rest.Can you guess who the superior one are?
Posted By Ahmad :October 30, 2007 9:07 AM ET Going into this, what would you say was your biggest apprehension and did it materialize?Thanks,
Posted By Danielle :October 30, 2007 9:07 AM ET "Young men watching popular American TV shows on satellite dishes. Young women wearing garish makeup. Teenagers sending secret text messages and arranging illicit trysts."This "shocking subculture" is supposed to give us the 'real story' about the Middle East? The whole premise of (gasp! omigod they're not all muslim fanatics because they drink, wear makeup and presumably have premarital sex!) is ridiculous and in fact simply reinforces a Huntington/Lewis'esque Clash of Civilizations world view.Is this what the author set out to 'uncover'? Is this what the Bush administration sees as the 'hope for the future'? Or is it CNN's sexing up of a mediocre travel narrative by an administration hack, (albeit a twentysomething one)? At any rate it seems little more than the continued vapid simplification of an entire region, not to mention ignoring our own highly problematic role in it.
Posted By michelle :October 30, 2007 11:22 AM ET I do not believe that the author intended this article to be racist, as Ahmad points to. The way in which the author portrays Cohen's story is a bit sloppy. The intention I believe was to show how some of the Islamic community supports the western way of life, not to show that the Islamic way of life is wrong; although Ahamad, there are many interpretations of the Islamic religion that do lead to bad things, as there are interpretations of the Christian religion that lead to bad things. Just remember that all Americans aren't against the Islamic way of life. We aren't all out to get you.
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 11:29 AM ET After having gone through this rather out of the box experience (kudos, by the way!), how have you changed and what advice would you give to the rest of us?
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 11:36 AM ET I appreciate very much your effort to get the perspective of youth in these countries; I think it could prove valuable to our country (the US) if we pay heed to what you have learned. I feel that under-30 generation in America is also the best hope for the West. My question is how do you think we can use the knowledge gained from their perspectives to work toward peace and communion with their countries and religious communities and for world harmony?
Posted By Katie Omaha Nebraska :October 30, 2007 11:54 AM ET Visiting countries that have on numerous occassions murdered journalist is not worth the risk and is irresponsible.So's going to war. At least Jared's mission is a positive one. And I hardly think he's purporting any sort of superiority; he's simply showing that Middle Eastern teens are different than the terrorism-happy image that American media tends to project. It's not his doing that they happen to embrace Western culture.
Posted By Jennifer :October 30, 2007 12:00 PM ET Is it true that Hip Hop music is popular in Iran's youth? Can they use bit torret to download music & TV shows?
Posted By mitch :October 30, 2007 12:07 PM ET Umm... there is nothing particularly spectacular about anything he has done. In fact, if you have spent any time in a truly cosmopolitan city it will not be too long before you find yourself at the Iran Air booking office on Piccadilly and shortly thereafter at an 'underground' party in Tehran... seriously no big deal and the same a a regular 'kegger' in SoCal. None of this is really a particularly 'dangerous' or spectacular journey into the 'hotbed of insurgency'. Global kids do this ALL the time.
Posted By A :October 30, 2007 12:10 PM ET An attempt at entering the middle east as a journalist has to be a quite daunting and uneasy task to say the least. What are some of the most suprising and possibly memorable results and/or experiences that you had during your endeavors in the middle east?
Posted By Scott C. :October 30, 2007 12:12 PM ET Very brave...as an american jew did you ever consider the fate of daniel pearl? I am assuming they knew you were jewish
Posted By Robert Schulman :October 30, 2007 12:21 PM ET Ahmad,I think you are misunderstanding that comment. I read it as, perhaps this under 30 generation doesn't possess as much hate toward these American objects as some in older Islamic generations do (those that do not want these objects imposed on their culture). I do agree with you that other cultures are often judged compared to the American standard - which is ignorant. I just do not think that that was what the author was saying here.
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 1:21 PM ET In my view, any efforts to non-objectify each other (and to not let the media feed this objectification) is a positive move. Regardless of where people live….US, Europe, MiddleEast, Africa or wherever….. to understand that a person that seems so different from me actually has similar interests and wishes is incredibly powerful. Isn't it one of the reasons we are all gravitating toward social networks, and blogging, etc. How can I dislike someone who is moved by the same music as me? How can I feel anything be empathy for someone who dances late into the night, or who blushes at the thought of their love interest? Kuddos to Jared, and others who remind us of our fundamental human links. If this topic is interesting there is another good book(Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America and American in Iran) by Azadeh Moaveni. She gives both the view of growing up in the US and spending a lot of time in Iran.
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 2:28 PM ET They let you in with a name like Cohen? I think I'm repeating what other people have said, but just because they're Americanized doesn't mean it's a good thing. And also, why didn't you come to Israel?
Posted By Elisheva, from Israel :October 30, 2007 2:38 PM ET How did Jared go about setting up the meetings?? Were his guest eager to meet with him? Did the trust him right away?
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 3:20 PM ET Well, that's brave. But the question is: does he have "the guts" to see what Palestinian children in Gaza are undergoing? Does he have the guts to criricize America's unflinching support for Israel? Does he have the guts to see that, in the summer of 2005, Israel was intentionally destroying hospitals and lively structures in Lebanon? To dare to criticize Israel or not, that's the question. To be a Jew does not necessarily mean you have to be on Israel's side if it's making wrong and brutal acts. To be a human being is the priority.
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 4:31 PM ET At what can still be considered such a young age, what persuaded you at 25 to travel so far into such a dangerous place in search of information that many did not even know exsisted?
Posted By Larry, Indiana :October 30, 2007 5:13 PM ET Jared, What can I do as a middle-aged, white women, to bridge the gap of hatred between arabs and americans?
Posted By Anonymous :October 30, 2007 7:16 PM ET To my amazement and as an Iranian living in US, I'm blown away by your research and findings. My question is at such a young age, how did it all come about? Why did you decide to study Middle East, and how did you supported your self financially??Great job by the way
Posted By safeyeh tarassod :October 31, 2007 12:53 AM ET I went to college with Jared, and he has always had amazing goals. I had the great fortune of being his travel buddy on our first trip to Ghana. I'm very proud of him and all that he has accomplished. He has already gone far beyond his goals at that time. My question for him is, what is next?
Posted By Portia :November 1, 2007 7:23 AM ET Jared,Where did you find the courage to enter such hostile areas of the world? I'm sure you knew your own life was at risk when you did so. How can you help others understand what it takes to perform similar deeds? Your work can bring lots of positive energy to the world. It is exactly what the world needs and if delivered by the masses, just imagine what we could do for humanity. Keep up the good work.
Posted By Eric :November 1, 2007 7:35 AM ET I am a christian arab and I have many muslim friends, I know that most of them do not hate the U.S.A or americans. What they do not like is the US policy toward the mideast conflict, what they and I do not like are kids living in camps being killed by Isreal almost every day. Arabs do like the way americans can elect their leaders and they hope some day they can do the same, instead they know that the US government supports the un-elected leaders in the middle east. The unemployment among the young people in the middle east is high and when they do have jobs the pay is low, so I do think that there is hope when things do change and when the US change its policy in the middle east
Posted By Tony :November 1, 2007 7:55 AM ET How would you say these Iranian youths perception of the West and its culture will affect the 'War on Terrorism' in the future?
Posted By Sashana :November 1, 2007 8:06 AM ET Talk about the sentiments of some of the new friends you made. Do they hate Americans or just the American government? Or do they like us?

Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 9:31 AM ET Very impressive. I would like to know how the people you spoke with felt about a Jewish ma interviewing them?Thanks
Posted By randi in Virginia :November 1, 2007 9:33 AM ET Hi Jared, I'm wondering what everyday Americans can do to help foster understanding with the under-30 generation in Muslim countries. If this is our "best hope for the West," what can we do to help? Thanks, and your book sounds really interesting!
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 10:33 AM ET Hi Jared,What do the the young people of Iran think about their controversial leader? Is his "wipe Israel off the map" mentailty shared by many of the people you encountered?
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 10:46 AM ET How do you think your interviewees would have received you had you been female? Are attitudes towards women in the Middle East finally changing, or are they still oppressive?
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 10:52 AM ET As a fellow 20-something with a degree in International Studies and an MBA with a concentration in International Business, I have to say nice job! ...and are you single? :)
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 11:04 AM ET Was his main goal to interview Muslim youth? How about the numerous Christian youth that live in the regions he visited? Did he interview this group of youth and find out how life was for them living amongst a religion that looks down on them and wants them gone? At least the Muslim youth live in a country in which they fit in, they are not targeted and murdered for their religion like the hundreds of thousands of Christian were and are every day. Before you post a comment about my comment please know that I lived in Iran, grew up there as a Christian and went to school and lived there enough to see the discrimination and hate that comes about when you are of a different religion.
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 11:47 AM ET My question would be, what makes the author think bumming around Lebanon and Iran, hanging out at McDonald's and going to frat parties constitutes a scientific or even basically sound, basis for the writing of a book that claims to be an authority on the subject of Middle Eastern youth?
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 12:51 PM ET Jared, I admire your courage and applaud you achievement. You have demonstrated fine work, and a sincere concern for humanity and understanding. Yet, as you are a Rhodes Scholar, I would have expected a more academic and less qualitative objective. While this is certainly a moving account of your experiences in dangerous regions, what exactly --if at all--is your academic "arguement" here? Best wishes on all your future works!
Posted By Anonymous :November 1, 2007 3:23 PM ET To the first anonymous poster, if the measure by which you define irresponsibility is danger, then everyone who owns and operates a car is irresponsible. And who are you to decide what risking ones own life is worth? I believe that what Jared has done should be the standard M.O for all our foreign diplomats. We might actually stop this war by doing what he has done.
Posted By PJ :November 27, 2007 9:58 AM ET I'm an American Jew who recently served as an Army officer in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I got along just fine with the locals of these Muslim countries, and I actually made some long-term friends. And yes, they all knew I was Jewish.Despite what you may believe, most civilized Muslims are good people just like everyone else. True, most of them are anti-Israel (as many have candidly told me), but their reasoning is often more political than it is religious.The typical Western traveler does not usually meet the hardcore extremists in Muslim countries; they're few and far between. However, if Jared is actually interviewing children of these die-hard jihadists, then he deserves a great deal of respect -- he could actually make a difference.

Posted By Debbie :November 29, 2007 6:37 AM ET I think people have a bad opinion of Islam and the Muslim countries. They should not be judge by their turbans or burkas. They have the right to practice their religion freely and wear whatever pleases them. However, I was glad to read that their views on Jews and Americans are not as negative as we thought they would be. That is why I think they are the best hope for the West not because they are becoming Americanized.
Posted By Anonymous :November 29, 2007 8:54 AM ET The future has always been with children. I would like to see more young people from the Middle East reporting on the good young people of the US and other countries. I think we all could use a different point of view. Thanks Jared.
Posted By Anonymous :November 29, 2007 10:26 AM ET Jared is a very brave young man. Perseverance may eventually lead to open doors, open eyes, and confront the truth of Islam.
Posted By Monica :November 29, 2007 10:27 AM ET Dude, I just read your book Children of Jihad and heard you interviewed on youtube.com via the BBC.
