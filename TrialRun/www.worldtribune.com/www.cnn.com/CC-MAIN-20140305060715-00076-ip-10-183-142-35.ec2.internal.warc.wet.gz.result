Scientists piece together human ancestryStory Highlights A 47-million-year-old fossil is being heralded as an early human ancestor Scientist says the find is the "most complete primate fossil before human burial" The fossil was discovered in the 80s, but was split between collections until now Next Article in Technology » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- Scientists hailed Tuesday a 47-million-year-old fossil of an ancient "small cat"-sized primate as a possible common ancestor of monkeys, humans and other primates. The fossil is believed to be an ancestor of monkeys, humans and other primates. Scientists say the fossil, dubbed "Ida," is a transitional species, living around the time the primate lineage split into two groups: A line that would eventually produce humans and monkeys, and another that would give rise to primates such as lemurs. The fossil was formally named Darwinius masillae, in honor of the anniversary of Charles Darwin's 200th birthday. "This is the most complete primate fossil before human burial," said Dr. Jorn Hurum, of the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo, who led the study of the fossil, a young female primate. "And it's not a few million years old; it's 47 million years old," Hurum said, speaking at a news conference at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The fossil was discovered in 1983 in the Messel Pit, Germany, near Frankfurt, and had been until recently in private collections, according to an article published Tuesday in the scientific journal PLoS ONE, a publication of the Public Library of Science. Read the report from PLoS ONE However, because it was split into two parts, its significance was not immediately recognized. Don't Miss Famous paleontologist to plead guilty to fossil theft

An international team of scientists, which Hurum led, conducted a detailed forensic analysis of the fossil for the past two years, the release said. Hurum nicknamed the fossil Ida after his young daughter, he said. The fossil's body is nearly complete; only part of one leg is missing, according to Hurum. In addition to the bones, the softer features are also preserved, as are the remnants of its last meal: fruits, seeds and leaves, which were found in Ida's gut, according to the scientists. "It's such a beautiful specimen," Hurum said of Ida. He said the fossil is about 2 feet long, "like a small cat in size." The fossil has both adult and baby teeth, indicating that it was weaned and about 9 months old when it died, the PLoS article said. She would have eventually grown to the size of a lemur, the article said. The young primate fossil does not have two crucial anatomical features found in lemurs: a grooming claw on the second digit of its foot and a fused row of teeth in the middle of its lower jaw, known as a toothcomb, the scientists said. X-rays revealed a broken wrist, which the team of scientists believe may have contributed to Ida's death, according to a news release from the museum at Oslo. Ida may have been overcome by carbon dioxide gas while drinking from the Messel lake, which was often covered by a low-lying blanket of the gas, the news release said. Hampered by the broken wrist, the young primate may have fallen into unconsciousness and may have slipped into the lake. The primate sunk to the bottom and was preserved for 47 million years, the news release said.

Gamers fuming over PlayStation hack By John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets PlayStation 3 owners haven't been able to use their systems to play online or download games since April 20. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gamers are angry Sony didn't tell them sooner that its PlayStation Network was hacked The online component of PlayStation has been down since April 20 About 70 million people use the network Sony says it's unclear if credit card info has been compromised (CNN) -- It's been seven days since Louis Pietig's PlayStation gaming system worked -- and he's pretty mad about that. But far more infuriating, he said, is the fact that Sony kept him in the dark for so long about the reason for an ongoing PlayStation Network outage: a hack of its online system that compromised users' personal data possibly including credit card information. On that subject, Pietig is furious. "It's ridiculous, the transfer of information from Sony to the end game users," he said by phone, after responding to a query from the @cnntech Twitter feed. "It's deplorable that they wouldn't tell us that you should look at your credit card." Pietig, a 25-year-old in New York, said he already cancelled the credit card he linked with Sony's network because he was concerned about the security of his financial information. "If you think for a second that someone may have seen your credit card and you don't get a new one, you're an idiot," he said. Sony faces possible lawsuit over breach

The Sony PlayStation Network -- the online component of the popular gaming system, which allows players to buy games online, play games with friends in remote locations and watch movies through Netflix and other video services -- has been down since April 20. The network has some 70 million subscribers. PlayStation users were greeted with an error message if they tried to get online, but the company did not comment on the potential cause of the network outage until Tuesday, when it posted a blog with this statement: "We have discovered that between April 17 and April 19, 2011, certain PlayStation Network and Qriocity service user account information was compromised in connection with an illegal and unauthorized intrusion into our network." Sony says it's unclear if users' credit card info was stolen, but the gaming company advises players who linked their cards to the PlayStation Network to check their bank statement for strange activity. "If you have provided your credit card data through PlayStation Network or Qriocity, out of an abundance of caution we are advising you that your credit card number (excluding security code) and expiration date may have been obtained," the company said in a statement sent to PlayStation users. The angry comments have been rolling in since. Many users say it took Sony too long to notify people of the hack. "Sony has been really bad at handling it. I've been getting all the information on it from other sources," said Justin Coriddi, a 33-year-old PlayStation owner in Orlando. "Over the weekend, their only statement was that they were looking into the issue still. So that was pretty much just saying nothing." Coriddi said he purchased a video game for Microsoft's Xbox system instead of on Sony PlayStation because of the continuing outage. "This update is about 6 days LATE," wrote one commenter on Sony's blog. "I think it is time to move to the other network, no regard for customers here." Sony said Tuesday that it notified people as soon as possible. "We learned there was an intrusion April 19th and subsequently shut the services down. We then brought in outside experts to help us learn how the intrusion occurred and to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident," the company said in a blog post on Tuesday night. "It was necessary to conduct several days of forensic analysis, and it took our experts until yesterday to understand the scope of the breach. We then shared that information with our consumers and announced it publicly this afternoon." The PlayStation Network outage may continue for a while. Sony said Tuesday it could take another week before they "expect to restore some services." Share this on:

Rallies in Cairo as Morsy sets date for constitution referendum By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 10:01 AM EST, Thu December 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: President's supporters cheer proposed constitution at rallies in Cairo, elsewhere
NEW: But an opposition leader rips the document and says "the struggle will continue" Egyptians can vote in a referendum on the proposed constitution on December 15
Protesters have criticized Morsy for what they call an undemocratic power grab

Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptians will vote in two weeks to approve, or reject, a new constitution -- a potentially pivotal moment for the North African nation that underwent a revolution a year ago and, more recently, has seen its president become the target of fierce protests.
President Mohamed Morsy on Saturday announced a December 15 referendum date on what could become the nation's constitution, shortly it was presented to him by the Islamist-dominated assembly that crafted it.
While his supporters cheered the move, there was little indication the vote or anything Morsy said would placate the opposition.
"(Morsy) put to referendum a draft constitution that undermines basic freedoms & violates universal values," said Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and head of Egypt's Constitution Party, on his Twitter account. "The struggle will continue."
The proposed constitution will be published Sunday in government newspapers, said Hossam al-Gheryani, head of the 85-person group that pushed through its 234 articles Friday after 21 hours of haggling. Egypt effectively has been without a guiding constitution, as well as a legislature, since the 2011 revolution marked by the ouster of its longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.

Egyptians protest president's powers
Islamists call for Morsy support rally Egyptian women protest against Morsy
Egyptian council approves constitution
Thousands of the president's supporters packed streets around Cairo University on Saturday, taking part in marches and a massive rally organized by the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political branch that Morsy once led. They carried banners featuring Morsy's photo, waved the Egyptian flag and chanted their support.
An even larger rally took place just south of Cairo in the city of Giza. It involved Brotherhood members, fellow Islamist groups and others including the Egyptian Revolution's Alliance, the Revolutionary Front to Protect the Revolution and the Coalition of the January 25th Youth.
Other pro-Morsy rallies were held in the northern port city of Alexandria and the central city of Asiut.
These events aimed to bolster Morsy after more than a week of protests against him, during which stones flew, demonstrators and police clashed and clouds of tear gas wafted through, among other places, Tahrir Square in central Cairo.
That landmark square, which is across the Nile River from one large pro-Morsy rally, remained buzzing Saturday night with people who have camped out there and marched elsewhere to vent their anger at the president. They have called Morsy a dictator, even worse than Mubarak, for his edict declaring that his past and future decisions are immune from judicial oversight -- new power that the president insists is only temporary.
They responded to his speech, which was blared over loudspeakers, by chanting, "Leave, leave" -- suggesting that, whatever comes of the constitutional referendum, their goal remains removing Morsy as president.
Morsy's controversial edict, issued November 22, energized the opposition and led them to reoccupy Tahrir Square, as dissidents did in the winter of 2011.
Seeds of Egypt's past sown long ago
Many saw it as an overbearing, undemocratic grab for power that left the president in charge without any checks and balances. Morsy described it as a necessary move to fight judges loyal to Mubarak's regime who were blocking progress in government.
It engendered sharp opposition within Egypt's judiciary, with many courts basically shut down as judges and prosecutors went on strike. Despite the order, the nation's high administrative court has indicated it will review the proposed constitution -- though it's not clear, if they rule it invalid, if that will prevent the referendum.
As part of his edict, Morsy had also given the constitutional assembly up to six more months to craft the pivotal document. But amid the raging discontent, the president spurred the group to speed up its work -- an expedited process that prompted Christian, liberal and leftist members of the group to walk-out in protest, with many of them later replaced by Islamists.
Essam El-Erian, a senior Morsy adviser, insisted all viewpoints -- including the need to safeguard freedoms when it comes to things like gender and religion -- were taken into account nonetheless. But critics are unconvinced.
Opinion: Don't blame Muslim Brotherhood for Morsy power grab
A quick glimpse at the constitution's articles show language dealing with individuals' civil rights, particularly how security forces and the justice system treats them.
There is wording prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring due process, a sensitive topic in Egypt. Mubarak and his loyalists are blamed for jailing and harshly mistreating innocent people in the years before and especially during last year's uprising.
One article stipulates no one in jail can be interrogated without a lawyer present, and if detainees don't have one, the judicial system must appoint one. Phone conversations, electronic correspondence and other communication could not be taped without a warrant.
Protesters to Morsy: Roll back your decree or leave
While many of the articles sound democratic, the fine print indicates otherwise, some human rights advocates say.
"Moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch.
Mohamed Naeem, a member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said he fears the proposed constitution would open the way for a theocracy by moving the country closer to Sharia law.
The preamble includes language pertaining to women, saying they are equal to men, but it also accentuates their role as mothers.
And the United Nations' high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has urged Morsy to reconsider the draft, saying a number of measures contained in it are incompatible with international human rights law.
Beyond the details about the constitution itself, some see this month's vote more generally as a referendum on the government.
Morsy took office in June as Egypt's first popularly elected president, following decades in which Mubarak held vast powers and limited dissent (including by banning the Muslim Brotherhood). But Morsy's recent moves have stirred suspicions that he and his Islamist allies are intent on amassing powers at the expense of others.

Health care will be an Obama legacy
By Julian Zelizer, CNN Contributor
updated 7:50 AM EST, Mon March 4, 2013
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that his state would accept the Medicaid expansion that is part of the ACA.

Julian Zelizer: The politics of health care is changing fast
Zelizer: President Obama's Affordable Health Care Act is gaining more support
He says two of the most prominent Republicans have switched to support the ACA
Zelizer: The ACA is on its way to becoming an important legacy of the Obama presidency
Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and "Governing America."
(CNN) -- The politics of health care is changing fast. President Barack Obama's Affordable Health Care Act was vulnerable during his first term when Republicans demanded repeal of the law. Even after the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality, there were still many voices who objected to it.
However, with each passing day, it appears that the program is in good shape, slowly becoming part of the fabric of American government.
Last week, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, one of the main potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said that his state would accept the Medicaid expansion that is part of the ACA. Christie had been one of the president's toughest critics, frequently lambasting the program as a prime example of big government liberalism. But he has changed his tune.
Julian Zelizer
The expansion of Medicaid will allow about 104,000 of the poorest residents in New Jersey to gain access to health insurance. Christie said: "Let me be clear: I am no fan of the Affordable Health Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America. I fought against it and believe, in the long run, it will not achieve what it promises. However, it is now the law of the land. I will make all my judgments as governor based on what is best for New Jerseyans."
Christie's announcement comes on top of an even more dramatic reversal, that of Florida's Gov. Rick Scott.
The former health industry executive, who was elected to lead the Sunshine State in 2010, has been one of the more conservative voices in the GOP. Scott, who once warned that "Obamacare will result in the rationing of health care, significant tax increases, significant job losses and the inability of many Americans to keep their existing health insurance" also announced that Florida would accept the new Medicaid funds.
"When the federal government is committed to paying 100% of the cost," Scott said, "I cannot, in good conscience, deny Floridians that need access to health care."

Fewer Republicans are interested in fighting against the ACA any more. Not only is it a losing issue, but in the next few years, the benefits are going to start rolling in and more Americans will come to depend on the protections.
The shift in position by two of the most prominent Republicans suggests that the political dynamics are shifting, as Obama's supporters had always hoped. Republican officials now see powerful incentives for them to embrace the law rather than oppose it.
The biggest watershed moment for the ACA came in June 2012 when the Supreme Court ruled that the health care legislation was constitutional.

Like in 1937, when the Supreme Court declared that the Social Security tax was constitutional, the court's ruling on health care gave Obama's program a legitimacy that undercut some of the thunder coming from the right. The Affordable Care Act became law of the land. Then the 2012 presidential election was an affirmation of popular support for Obama and the policies for which he fought.
It's not unusual for a big piece of legislation to elicit strong oppositions at first.
With Social Security, the program experienced over a decade of uncertainty. A means tested program for the elderly proved much more popular during the 1940s, and Congress refused to raise Social Security taxes during World War II. But by the early 1950s, Social Security emerged as the primary means of helping the elderly.
As more Americans were receiving their checks, fewer politicians in either party opposed the program. President Dwight Eisenhower concluded that the GOP had little choice but to accept the program. Republicans and Democrats, including Southern Democrats, voted to increase benefits every two years. By the 1980s, Social Security would be considered to be the "third rail" in American politics -- touch the benefits and you die.
Similarly, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 experienced strong reactions. The notion of prohibiting racial segregation was incredibly contentious. But once Congress passed it, Southern politicians, citizens and institutions quickly fell in line. In the 1970s and 1980s, issues such as affirmative action and school busing still riled up many, but de jure racial segregation was no longer considered acceptable by most.
More recently, during President George W. Bush's presidency, the new counterterrorism programs provoked heated debates. Democrats railed against the tough interrogation techniques used by the government to combat terrorism and highlighted institutions such as Guantanamo as symbols of what the nation was doing wrong. But Obama abandoned many of his plans to dismantle these programs.
His nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA and the protection of key documents that allegedly support the assassination of American citizens reveal how much the tide has turned.
Today, there is considerable evidence that the health care law is approaching that turning point.
As Ezra Klein wrote in The Washington Post, "so long as Obamacare is accepted as the law of the land, and repeal is dismissed by most Republicans as little more than a pleasant fantasy, then a constructive process can begin in which Republicans seize on problems with the law as an opportunity to reform the reforms -- and through that process, begin to buy into the new system."
There is still a lot of work that needs to be done, such as making sure that the health care exchanges work and that funding for the program remains adequate. The program's success is not inevitable. But the recent change of heart from the darlings of the Republican Party is an indication the ACA is much further along to becoming one of the most important legacies of the Obama presidency.

Doh! 20 biggest travel mistakes
By Chuck Thompson, CNN
updated 8:16 PM EDT, Fri August 2, 2013
There's no faster way to become embittered with the locals than going toe-to-toe with hungry shopkeepers. Do you really need to whittle 50 cents off that embroidered handbag?
The Armenian peasant jacket or Metallica nesting dolls you didn't buy? Not having them will haunt the rest of your life. When you see something you like, just buy it.
"Near city center" is like a Bible verse -- open to vast interpretation. When the money you saved on your "near city center" hotel is wasted on 30-minute commutes and outrageous taxi fare, you've committed a cardinal travel sin.
Making a travel plan using only your guidebook is like making a plan to stand in line for a week. Pull no more than a suggestion or two a day from a guide that thousands are carrying. So where's that Kafka statue, again?
A survey says two-thirds of travelers return from trips with six unworn outfits. Figure on two wears for (almost) everything. Trial-size shampoo bottles are handy -- until they burst open in-flight, spreading glycerol soap snot all over your bag. Nobody back home wants to scroll through your 9,000 lame images.
Arriving less than two hours before any Heathrow flight is risky. Imagine walking across a football stadium and you get an idea of the Andean trek from the Heathrow Express station to the lifts that will transport you merely to the start of your Oz-like journey through Terminal 1.
You can hit a foreign city like a cashless bumpkin or, for a few extra bucks, arrive with some local coin. Convenience factor makes it worth accepting a slightly higher rate and changing a small amount of cash at the airport.
You think, "I'll wear 'em for a week, why buy the good ones?" The answer comes when you blow out a toe strap and shred your foot a mile into a hike across the local lava beds. A week of texts from St. Lucia shouldn't cost more than open-heart surgery. But it happens all the time to travelers who fail to check their phone plans before departure. CheapAir.com says the lowest fares are available 49 days before a flight. Kayak says it's 21 days before domestic flights and 34 days before international ones. Texas A&M researchers simply say Saturdays and Sundays are best. The golden rule to cheap fares? There's no golden rule. Wait on the curb for a ride in a van and risk being the last one dropped off on a nine-hotel run, all to save a few bucks? Your time is worth more than that.
No one wants to get sick on vacation, but why travel all the way to Thailand or Mexico and not eat the local grub? If locals are in line, consider the place vetted -- you're going to be fine.
If you end up needing the travel insurance you purchased, you're going to want the full coverage. Even if you do love your drum circle buds, there are some balls and chains you really don't want to lug around.
Carnival Rio! It's a nightmare come true when you get turned away at the ticket counter on departure day because you didn't realize Brazil requires you to secure a visa before travel.
This is the fastest way of paying through the nose for the privilege of paying through the nose.
At 344 square miles, Berlin is larger than New York City and, as the first-time visitor quickly learns, has just as many places to see, eat, drink, shop and get lost. They're already on your phone, why bother with hard copies of your hotel name and address? Because your phone and electronics might not work with the local network as soon as you land.
HIDE CAPTION
Chiseling out a bargain
Not buying something you like, right now
Trusting "city center" descriptions
Over-reliance on guidebooks
Overpacking
Loose shampoo caps
Obsessive photography
Underestimating Heathrow hell
Not changing money at the airport
Cheap flip-flops
International phone plan ignorance
Trying beat air fare pricing schemes
Taking the airport shuttle
Avoiding local food
Buying the partial insurance policy
Ill-advised drum purchase Visa ignorance
Using credit card to get cash
Tackling Berlin in a weekend
Not printing reservation details

But we're nowhere near perfect travelers.
Every one of the travel chokes on this list comes from painful personal experience -- often multiple times repeating the same mistakes. (We're nothing if not persistent.)
1. Overpacking At home, with your complete wardrobe available, there's no reason not to run through work, workout and working-the-clubs outfits in a single day.
But when your life is crammed into a couple bags, your fashion morality changes.
Those socks you wore on the plane should be good for another go.
The purple tee you slept in ought to be alright for a third wear.
Yesterday's undies? Well ...
According to a recent survey by Travelodge, two-thirds of travelers typically return from a trip with at least six unworn outfits.
The lesson: You don't need a new set of anything for each day of a trip. Figure on at least two wears for (almost) everything.

2. Not buying something you like as soon as you see it
You think you're gonna circle back to that shop.
You think you'll see a cheaper, better version somewhere else.
You won't.
That evocative street painting or those Metallica nesting dolls you didn't buy? Now not having them will haunt you for the rest of your life.
When you see something you like, just buy it and live without regret.
3. Not checking your phone plan before traveling abroad
What you call "international roaming" your phone carrier calls "shareholder dividend!"
A week of texts from Singapore or St. Lucia shouldn't cost more and hurt worse than open heart surgery. But it happens all the time to travelers who fail to check their phone plans before departure.
Near? Far from it.
4. Trusting "near city center" descriptions
"Near city center" is like a Bible verse -- open to vast interpretation.
When you find the money you saved on your "near city center" hotel is being spent on 30-minute commutes and outrageous taxi fares, you know you've committed one of the cardinal sins of travel.
Related note: Except by purely technical definition, if you're staying near the convention center in Portland, Oregon, you're decidedly not staying "downtown" (as is popularly advertised) by any local sensibility.
5. Taking the "super" shuttle
Wait on the curb for a ride in a sweat-soaked van and risk being the last one dropped off on a nine-hotel run, all in the name of saving a few bucks?
Your time is worth more than that.
Adam Carolla brilliantly sums up this classic travel blunder in his book, "In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks."
"The shuttle is the worst $20 you'll ever save. It adds 90 minutes to whatever a Town Car or cab would have been. You have the unenviable choice between being dropped off last or being dropped off first and having a bunch of losers who can't afford cab fare and have no friends or loved ones with cars knowing exactly where you live."
Perfect way to ruin an arrival -- shampoo snot.
6. Not tightening shampoo caps ... all the way
Those cute, little trial-size shampoo and conditioner bottles are really handy -- until they magically burst open in-flight, spreading a layer of glycerol soap snot all over your bag.
7. Thinking you know the perfect time to book a ticket
There's an art to reading the tea leaves of the airlines' protean pricing schemes, but there's some muddled science to it, as well.
According to Travelers Today, research conducted by Kayak found the optimal timing for a cheap-ticket purchase is 21 and 34 days before domestic and international flights, respectively.
But 2012 analysis by CheapAir.com concluded that on average the cheapest fares are found 49 days before a flight.
Meanwhile, researchers at Texas A&M University simply found that Saturdays and Sundays are best for finding discount fares.
The golden rule?
There's no golden rule. Tickets are cheapest when they're cheapest.
Editor's note: The original version of this story reported that CheapAir.com claimed the optimal ticket-buying time is 79 or 81 days prior to a flight. The error has been corrected.
Congrats, you just saved 50 cents. Now go get your blood pressure checked.
8. Trying too hard to chisel out a bargain
There's no faster way to become embittered with the locals than going toe-to-toe with a market full of hungry sales people and shopkeepers.
Yes, we understand there's principle involved, but do you really need to whittle the equivalent of fifty cents off the price of an embroidered handbag that's going to sit in the back of a closet anyway?
Just buy the damn thing and spare your heart the cortisol burst for when it actually needs it.
9. Not changing money at the airport
When traveling internationally, the conventional wisdom is that only amateurs change money at the airport, because the exchange rate for foreign currency will be better in town.
It usually is, but often not by that much.
A recent check of the dollar-to-pound exchange rate in London Heathrow was $1.71 to £1 (with no commission for changes more than $300).
Near Oxford Circus the exchange rate was advertised at $1.62 to £1, also with no commission.
Using these rates, converting $300 at the airport would get you £175.43 as opposed to £185.18 on the street.
So, you can hit the city like a cashless bumpkin and spend an hour hunting up an acceptable place to change money or, for less than £10, arrive with some local coin in your pocket.
Convenience factor alone makes it worth changing at least a nominal amount of cash at the "ripoff" place at the airport.
On the plus side, you're also getting in your day at the gym.
10. Underestimating the hell that is Heathrow
Speaking of London, it's easy to underestimate the several hundred miles of concourse you'll likely be obliged to traverse and the time-consuming security searches that create jumbled queues and make travelers look more like internment camp refugees than cosmopolitan jet setters.
Arriving anything less than two hours before an international flight is risky, but even a longer cushion can get dicey.
Imagine walking across a football stadium and you start to get an idea of the Andean trek from the Heathrow Express station to the swarm of travelers clamoring to get on lifts that will take them merely to their start of the Oz-like journey through Terminal 1.
11. Buying cheap flip-flops
You think, "I'm only gonna wear 'em for a week, I might not even take 'em home, why buy the good ones?"
The answer comes when you blow out a toe strap and shred the bottom of your foot a mile into a hike across the local lava beds.
And now you have to go back.
12. Fearing street food
No one wants to get sick on vacation, but why travel all the way to Thailand or Mexico and not eat the local grub?
The locals don't like food poisoning any more than you do. If they're in line, consider the place vetted and assume you're going to be fine.
(Cue angry commenters with the "I almost died from a tainted falafel" and "the locals are immune to bacteria" histrionics below.)
Buy a drum on your trip? Sounds dumb.
13. Buying a drum on the first day of a three-month trek across Asia
We know, this is the antithesis of travel mistake number two, but there are some balls and chains you really don't want to lug around the subcontinent.
Not because you'll make instant enemies with everyone in your hostel when they spy you struggling top-heavily into the dorm, but because a) you'll never play the thing, and b) you'll get back home, walk into the new Authentic Beats music shop that replaced your favorite bookstore while you were away and find 10 superior examples of your exact instrument.
14. Over-reliance on guidebooks
Making a travel plan using only your guidebook is like making a plan to stand in line at the bank for a week.
Guidebooks are great -- we use them all the time -- but it's best to pull just one or two suggestions per day from a guide that thousands of like-minded travelers have read or downloaded.
15. Not buying the full insurance policy
We're not a bunch of free spenders -- except when the boss whips out the company credit card at the pub -- but a lot of the mistakes on this list come down to adding a significant amount of stress to your life in the name of saving a few bucks.
If you actually end up needing the travel insurance you purchased (a move a significant percentage of our staff thinks is silly in the first place), you're going to want the full coverage.
Just because you're in a country where the beer is cheap, it doesn't mean the healthcare is.
That bargain insurance policy might pay for your flight home when you crash your motor scooter on a winding road in some island paradise.
But it won't cover the $5,000 in stitches and sponge baths you racked up during your three-day international hospital stay.
Pity the friends back home who'll have to scroll through the lot of them. Assuming he has any.
16. Obsessive photography
The obsession/obligation to document every street scene, statue and starter course kills the spontaneity and visceral experience that should be the backbone of travel.
It's now so easy to take photos that one click leads to another.
Before you know it, you have 300 pictures on your phone comprising old buildings, blurry sunsets and plates of food.
Congratulations. Your trip is now defined by low-quality images on a handset that, trust us, nobody back home wants to spend 20 minutes scrolling through.
17. Not checking visa requirements before departure
Carnival Rio!
It's a nightmare come true when you get turned away at the ticket counter on departure day because you didn't realize Brazil requires citizens of your benighted country to secure a visa before travel.
18. Attempting Berlin in a weekend
At 344 square miles, Berlin is a metropolitan Goliath, larger than New York City (301 square miles), and, as the first-time visitor quickly learns, with just as many places to see, eat, drink, shop and get lost.
19. Using a credit card to get cash
This is the fastest way of paying through the nose for the privilege of paying through the nose.
Credit card companies charge a high transaction fee (up to 15%) for using a card to get cash.
These special transactions also attract a higher associated fees than other purchases: the ATM-owning bank will charge a fee; if you're withdrawing a foreign currency the exchange rate will be miserly; and if you're not paying off your balance each month, credit card companies in some countries will apply your partial payments to normal purchases (with a lower interest rate, say 9%) before applying them to those cash advances (which have a much higher interest rate), milking your desperation for every pitiless penny.
"As I recall from the website, we were staying somewhere around here."
20. Not printing out reservation details
They're already on your phone and computer, so why bother with hard copies of your hotel name and address?
Because your phone, computer, tablet and other electronics might not work with the local network as soon as you land, especially after crossing oceans.
Now where are you supposed to go?

Jellyfish taking over oceans, experts warn
By Karla Cripps, CNN
updated 9:38 PM EST, Wed November 6, 2013
A 5-foot giant jellyfish recently washed up on a beach in Tasmania, an island off the southeast coast of Australia. Scientists are working to classify the new species. Click through the gallery to see more photos of jellyfish around the world.
A West Coast sea nettle swims in the Aquarium of the Pacific complex in Long Beach, California. Sea Nettles are most common during fall and winter months on California and Oregon shores, and may be found from Mexico to British Columbia. They're known for having a distinctive golden brown bell, up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Contact with the tentacles can produce a painful sting. These psychedelic jellyfish are part of a display at Beijing's Blue Zoo Aquarium. "Jellyfish occur in all marine waters from pole to pole and at all depths," says Dr. Lisa-Ann Gershwin, author of "Stung! On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Ocean." Life threatening varieties are found from about 40 degrees north to 40 degrees south latitude. These moon jellyfish are illuminated by colored lights at the Beijing Aquarium, the largest in China. They also call these "common" jellyfish. They're found in all the world's oceans, making them a popular choice for aquariums. A diver attaches a sensor to a large Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of Komatsu in Ishikawa prefecture, northern Japan. Large schools of these giant jellyfish, which have bodies ranging one to 1.5 meters in diameter, drift into Japanese waters in autumn and damage coastal fisheries. A lion's mane jellyfish swims near England's Farne Islands. This species is the largest of all jellyfish, and also one of the most dangerous, say scientists. Lion's manes have thick masses of dangling tentacles covered with stinging cells called nematocytes.
A Papuan -- or spotted -- jellyfish swims in a tank at the Sunshine Aquarium in Tokyo. According to National Geographic, their venom is mild and doesn't pose a threat to human beings. Though most of us try to avoid jellyfish in the ocean, few dispute how cool they look at in a well-lit tank. These Pacific Sea nettle jellyfish are part of a display at the Shark Reef Aquarium at the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Driven by overfishing and climate change, the dramatic proliferation of jellyfish in oceans around the world is a sign of ecosystems out of kilter, warn experts. Venomous mauve stingers (pictured), or Pelagia noctiluca, were found in high numbers along the coast of Catalonia and Valencia in summer 2013. This northern sea nettle is part of the jellyfish exhibition added to the SeaLife aquarium in Timmendorfer, Germany, earlier this year. Northern sea nettles, or chrysaora melanaster, are commonly found in the waters of the North Pacific. "Quite simply, most of us just don't like the thought of being stung by something slimy," says Dr. Gershwin. "There's the slime. There's the pain. So, more and more, places around the world that are suffering from jellyfish problems are developing prediction systems so that tourists can know when it is safe to swim." Despite being smaller than a pinky nail, the irukandji packs a bigger punch than most species of jellyfish. "How toxic they are is just phenomenally frightening and equally fascinating," says jellyfish expert Dr. Gershwin. "Just the lightest brush -- you don't even feel it -- and then whammo, you're in more pain than you ever could have imagined, you are struggling to breathe, you can't move your limbs, you can't stop vomiting and your blood pressure just keeps going up and up."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Scientists say jellyfish are proliferating faster than ever before
Changing water temperatures and overfishing are behind the surge in population
Irukandji, box jellyfish among the world's most deadly varieties Contrary to popular belief, treating a jellyfish sting with urine isn't advised
(CNN) -- It's a beautiful afternoon on the beach.
The sun is shining, you're rolling in the waves, showing off the toned torso you worked on at the gym all winter.
Suddenly a sharp, burning sensation hits your skin.
You've just been stung by a jellyfish.
World's jellyfish population booming
If experts' warnings are true, swimmers around the world can expect to experience these unwanted love taps in greater numbers than ever before.
"Jellyfish and tourism are not happy bedfellows," says Dr. Lisa-Ann Gershwin, author of the recently published book, "Stung! On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Ocean."
Gershwin says popular beach resorts around the world are seeing huge increases in jellyfish "bloom" activity, a result of overfishing and changing water temperatures.
"The French and Spanish Rivieras, Chesapeake Bay, the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii ... some of the numbers are staggering," says the American scientist who's now based in Australia.
Despite being smaller than a pinky nail, the irukandji jellyfish is one of the world's most toxic animals.
"In Hawaii there have been times that 800 or 1,000 people have been stung in a day. In Spain or Florida, it's not uncommon in recent years for a half a million people to be stung during an outbreak. These numbers are simply astonishing."
At the beginning of October, a large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor.
Jellyfish prompt nuclear shutdown
In Ireland, a jellyfish bloom reportedly killed thousands of farmed salmon, according to the Irish Times.
This past summer, southern Europe experienced one of its worst jellyfish infestations ever. Experts there have been reporting a steady increase in the number of jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea for years.
According to a report titled "Review of Jellyfish Blooms in the Mediterranean and Black Sea," written by Fernando Borea for the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and the United Nations, scientists are catching up to what travelers in the Med have been experiencing for years.
"In the last decade ... the media are reporting on an increasingly high number of gelatinous plankton blooms," reads the report. "The reason for these reports is that thousands of tourists are stung, fisheries are harmed and even impaired by jellyfish."
Although noting that significant jellyfish blooms "have been known since ancient times and are part of the normal functioning of the oceans," the report cites global warming and global overfishing (which removes jellyfish predators) as causes for exploding jellyfish populations in recent years.
A diver attaches a sensor to a large Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of Komatsu in northern Japan. Large schools of these giant jellyfish, which have bodies ranging one to 1.5 meters in diameter, drift into Japanese waters in autumn and damage coastal fisheries.
The situation in the Mediterranean was dire enough to prompt Britain's foreign office to issue a warning to its citizens vacationing along Europe's southern coast to watch out for jellyfish.
The world's deadliest jellyfish
There are more than 2,000 species of jellyfish swimming through the world's waters.
Most stings are completely harmless. Some will leave you in excruciating pain.
Then there are the killers.
Many of the world's deadliest jellyfish are box jellyfish, which refers to the species' cube-shaped meduae.
"There are several species of big box jellyfish that have caused many deaths -- these include chironex fleckeri in Australia, chironex quadrigatus in Japan and related species in Thailand, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia," says associate professor Jamie Seymour, a venom biologist at Australia's James Cook University.
Also known as the sea wasp and the northern Australian box jellyfish, the chironex fleckeri is possibly the worlds most venomous animal.
Its tentacles can reach lengths of up to three meters long, while its bell is about the size of a human head. It can be found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific.
A close cousin and fellow contender for the "world's most venomous" cup is the Irukandji, which is the size of a thimble.
Good luck scanning the waters for that one before you leap in.
"How toxic they are is just phenomenally frightening and equally fascinating," says Gershwin.
"Just the lightest brush -- you don't even feel it -- and then, whammo, you're in more pain than you ever could have imagined, and you are struggling to breathe and you can't move your limbs and you can't stop vomiting and your blood pressure just keeps going up and up.
"It is really surprising how many places they occur around the world -- places you would never expect: Hawaii, Caribbean, Florida, Wales, New Caledonia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, India ... as well as Australia."
Asian giant hornets and other terrifying creatures
Is any place safe? "More and more, places around the world that are suffering from jellyfish problems with tourists are developing prediction systems so that tourists can know when it is safe," says Gershwin.
The irony, she says, is that tourists who avoid an area because of the known risk may alter their plans to hit a "safe" beach whose officials are merely less up front about the jellyfish situation, putting themselves more at risk.
A common misconception is that places such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines are free of dangerous jellyfish.
A sign warns against swimming in the sea due to the presence of deadly box jellyfish in Darwin, Australia. A 'Vinegar Station' offers a temporary remedy for those who have been stung. "Jellyfish occur in all marine waters from pole to pole and at all depths," says Gershwin. "The life threatening ones are found from about 40 degrees north to 40 degrees south latitude.
"Australia is upfront about its jellyfish dangers, and also assertive in safety management, whereas other places have them, but may understand less about them or, in some cases, just don't want to say. I think tourists need to be very aware of local hazards and not expect to necessarily be provided with information."
What to do when you're stung
Thanks to that infamous "Friends" episode that aired in 1997, millions of people think it's smart to treat a jellyfish sting with urine.
In reality, peeing on a jellyfish sting isn't a good idea.
A report in the Scientific American says urine can actually aggravate the jellyfish's stingers into releasing more venom.
Meanwhile, there's debate over what actually works on a jellyfish sting.
Many doctors say it all depends on whether the sting occurs place in tropical or nontropical waters.
If stung in tropical waters, one should rinse the area with vinegar to deactivate any nematocysts -- the parts of the stinger -- that are still hanging on.
"A freshwater rinse will have the opposite effect," says the Scientific American report. "Any change to the balance of solutes, such as the concentration of salts inside and outside of the cnidocyte [a venomous cell], sets off stinging."
In North America, doctors recommend using hot water and topical pain killers on a sting.
Can we turn this around? Gershwin says the explosion in jellyfish populations is a visible indicator that life in the oceans is out of balance.
"If we somehow managed to eradicate all jellyfish, then something else -- some other weedy thing -- would find a perfect situation," she says. "So the reason we should care is because they act as a flashing red light."
She says there's no one single factor to blame for the rise in jellyfish populations, but rather places blame on a combination of overfishing, warming water, low oxygen and pollution.
By fishing out jellyfish predators and competitors, humans are creating perfect conditions for jellyfish to multiply.
"Sadly, I am one of a growing chorus of people who believe that, yes, it is too late to turn things around," says Gershwin. "So many species are in such low numbers, and habitats are so badly damaged, that restoring them to their original splendor is simply no longer possible.
"I believe that our only option now is to decide how much we value what we currently have, and to decide what we are willing to do to maintain it -- or at least slow down its disappearance. But honestly, can you really see all 7 billion of us agreeing on that?"

America the beautiful
America has a new hero -- and how utterly appropriate that her first name is "America": America Ferrera.The star of the hit ABC show "Ugly Betty" was named best actress in a TV musical or comedy at the Golden Globes and, with her presence, sent a powerful message: that women everywhere -- women who are tired of the often unrealistic body image messages that Hollywood sends -- now have someone they can look up to as a symbolic representation of reality.In "Ugly Betty," Ferrera plays Betty Suarez, an overweight young woman with braces who plays an assistant working for the fictional fashion magazine Mode. She is the proverbial fish out of water, her looks glaring and daring in a world obsessed with every nuance of the superficiality of beauty."Showbiz Tonight" was backstage at the Golden Globes after Ferrera received her honor, and what she said should be applauded."I don't really see Betty as ugly. I see her as closer to the real girls I see in life," she said. "There are hundreds of Bettys in our own lives that we love, so we need to stop using that word ("ugly") and the expectations that we put on the generations. We need to tell the future to explore their talents and have [those women] offer what they have to offer beyond what they look like."America Ferrera was not the only fuller-figured beauty who was celebrated at the Golden Globes. Jennifer Hudson, who rightly deserved the award she received for best supporting actress in a musical or comedy for "Dreamgirls," recently proudly told "Showbiz Tonight," "I like my thickness. I'd rather be thick any day.""Showbiz Tonight" has seized this issue with our ongoing coverage of the "Showbiz Weight Watch." We've made it our mission to resist Hollywood's persistent beauty-definition pressure -- standards that make women feel ridiculously guilty for looking and feeling normal -- and to make sure stick-thin, scary-skinny stars and fashion models are not held up as role models to emulate, as well as expose the influence they have on many young women who are driven to eating disorders.With the likes of America Ferrera and Jennifer Hudson as real models, there may be some hope yet.

I have to agree 100%. Its tremendously encouraging to see America and Jennifer earn prominent places in Hollywood, inamongst all the skinny, nipped and tucked stars. What America said was dead on - if only women would EMBRACE that message and collectively refuse to conform to the unrealistic beauty standards pressuring them. Lorel and Maybelline can only sell their wrinkle cream, hair dyes, nail polish, eyeliners and lipsticks if women feel they need them to feel worthwhile and beautiful!
Posted By Alice, New York City : Wed Jan 17, 10:55:00 AM EST ET I donk think Ugly Betty should have one. I have seen the show several times and it is just average. The title just hits me as offensive also.
Posted By Barbara Manchester, MD : Wed Jan 17, 11:11:00 AM EST ET Bravo to Showbiz Tonight for going in this direction. With so many young children and even grown women trying so hard to emulate the starving stars of today, it's nice to see someone breaking the mold and showing that talent shouldn't be and in many cases isn't based on how thin you are. And congrats to America, Jennifer, and all the winners!
Posted By Heather, Toledo Ohio : Wed Jan 17, 11:15:00 AM EST ET Is it really that much better to have overweight body role models for women than unhealthily skinny ones? Jennifer Hudson and America Ferrera may more accurately represent most women in this country, but this country collectively has an obesity problem and embracing body types that fit our ever-expanding image will do nothing to stop it.
Posted By Jason, Columbia, SC : Wed Jan 17, 11:25:00 AM EST ET I have been thin all my life. I cannot help it. I am 41 years old, weigh 95 lbs and I'm 5'2". I have tried all my life to gain weight. All my life people have come up to me and asked me if I was anorexic. People would not go up to a large person and ask why they are fat. I finally accepted myself the way I am. I am very hurt when shows like Show Biz Tonight lashes out at thin people. You would not do that to large women. To use terms like "stick-thin, scary-skinny" is very offensive. Please don't say it is out of fashion either. My husband does not think I am scary. He makes me feel accepted because he never called my skinny. You make me feel so unattractive and unwomanly. It is very painful.
Posted By Justine Lim, Irvine, CA : Wed Jan 17, 11:27:00 AM EST ET I find the show offensive. I have seen pictures of America (The actress) And, she is far from Ugly. She is a little over weight and they put some fake braces on her and call her ugly. All they are doing is insulting the women in this world that have not been blessed with hollywood's version of beauty. I can imagine a young woman or teenager watching this show and saying to herself, "If that's ugly, I must be the bottom of the barrel" When in fact this young woman may be quite attractive. I think there is enough pressure in this country to be "beautiful" that we don't need to take an otherwise beautiful young woman dress her down and call her ugly just to get some TV rating. The women of this country do not need the pressure of trying not to be uglier than Betty. In my humble opinion.
Posted By Frank Denver, Colorado : Wed Jan 17, 11:33:00 AM EST ET OOO I cried when I heard speech and I cried again just reading a portion in this article. I agreee 100%. Many realize how different everyone gets treated. Because they do shows where skinny dresses up in a fat suite. We are all beauitful people on the inside. and everyone is different outside for a reason. It would be boring if we all looked alike. I applade America Ferrera for her speech (considering she said she wrote it while on limo on way. (words from the heart) and I do love the Show because it more normal with everyday situations. Keep up great work
Posted By Vicki, Seminole Florida : Wed Jan 17, 11:33:00 AM EST ET Why the personal attacks on thin models and actresses? Seems like Dave Levine has a personal vendetta against them. Are only stars like "America Ferrera and Jennifer Hudson" real models to him? Is he heavy? Lay off!
Posted By Anonymous : Wed Jan 17, 11:34:00 AM EST ET Ugly Betty is a great show. I don't like the word "overweight" to describe her. SHe looks like a healthy normal weight to me.
Posted By Mike Silver Spring, MD : Wed Jan 17, 11:41:00 AM EST ET Ugly Betty is great, and what is great are the layers. In the Show the less attractive aren't all good, and the pretty aren't all bad. It shows the pressures and the costs of both lives.
Posted By Winthrop, MA : Wed Jan 17, 11:43:00 AM EST ET There needs to be a middle ground. I have many patiens who are teenage girls whohave a new found pride in being "big girls", not "scrawny little sticks", who have BMIs over 30 and are prediabetic and hypertensive. Being overweight is at least as unhealth as being underweight.Ugliness and beauty are both found in attitude towards life, and thinking you are beautiful when you are dangerously fat or skinny is an ugly way of thinking.
Posted By Joe Los Angeles : Wed Jan 17, 11:45:00 AM EST ET Isn't it amazing how all an actress who plays 'Ugly Betty' has to do to turn back into your typical good looking woman is take off a pair of glasses? Let's be honest: 'Ugly' Betty is not and the show is tripe.
Posted By Dave, Bloomfield, NJ : Wed Jan 17, 11:46:00 AM EST ET I am getting sick and tired of this constant cultural assault on the cult of female beauty. What is wrong with being attractive? Why is it that no one seems to criticize it, when woman desire attractive men with good looking bodie's? Why is it that never seems to become an issue? I see far more obese women, who absolutely take no pride in their appearence more than woman who look like Victoria Secret girls. I hate that show Ugly Betty simply for the fact that it pictures women who are attractive as some how superficial and shallow, I personally think that is very unfair. For all of you who are sick and tired of the media's portrayal of female beauty, why dont' you all go to Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan where all women are forced to where veils! Long Live Female Beauty!!!!!!!
Posted By Alan, Va Beach Virginia : Wed Jan 17, 11:50:00 AM EST ET im a bit tired of pretty women playing parts labeled as "ugly", America Ferrera is not even remotely an unatractive woman. their is a world of differance between a truely physically unattractive person and someone who does not fit the barbie mold, real people find non barbies attractive to and a truely non attractive person truely does have it alot different from most people and i find it a bit annoying when attractive people are used as actors in situations where the person is suppsoed to be ugly, putting braces and a pair of glasses ona a woman does not turn her ugly and a woman who has a little weight or in her case more just a bit of curve does not make one ugly either as a photographer i see alot of women and i really feel its a disservice to people when we hold a woman such as America Ferrera up as an "ugly" (ven though the point is that shes not) actor i still feel it shows mass medias views more than it does the general culture of america no wonder kids (and im not just talking about girls)can be made to feel ugly when a woman like this is portrayed as an "ugly" person
Posted By j scozzari, hayden idaho : Wed Jan 17, 11:51:00 AM EST ET Now if the clothing designers and fashion industry would only pay attention!
Posted By Annette H., Victoria BC : Wed Jan 17, 11:59:00 AM EST ET I totally agree with Barbara, it is a very average show with Disney-like story. I never even thought it would get anywhere close to Golden Globes. There is absolutely nothing original in that show. I do not get it. The show is nothing but a repeat of "Devil Wears Prada" concept. Strange win.
Posted By Greg from Chicago : Wed Jan 17, 12:00:00 PM EST ET After watching the Globes and seeing America Ferrara (seriously, get the spelling right)in her gown, do you really think she's overweight? Granted, on the show, she looks dumpy, but on the show she also has oversized glasses and braces. America looks healthy and not like she needs a burger, as do most of the women on the show that follows "Ugly Betty".
Posted By Espy, Washington, DC : Wed Jan 17, 12:04:00 PM EST ET To celebrate this show is to cater to the people in our society who feel bad because they don't fit some kind of mold that pop culture has created for them. 'Ugly Betty' isn't rejecting the stereotype of extremely attractive white women on television shows, it is backwardly embracing it. It would be one thing if the creators hired a truly average-looking person to play a lead role in a TV show, but what they have done here is take a very attractive minority and place her in a show that is all about how "ugly" she is. IT is very much akin to the blackface performers back in the day. If it were just called 'Betty' and had a truly average-looking actress playing the lead role, as opposed to the normally-gorgeous America (see the glamour shots of Ms. Ferrera on IMDB.com) then it would be commendable, this is just pathetic.
Posted By Alex Austin, Texas : Wed Jan 17, 12:04:00 PM EST ET I am so proud of Showbiz Tonight for their stance. I can only imagine how much better my life (and many other lives) would have been if I didn't spend most of my time feeling inadequate. I think America and Jennifer are absolutely beautiful AND wonderfully talented. They both deserved to win.
Posted By Carla, Columbus, OH : Wed Jan 17, 12:04:00 PM EST ET When I saw Jennifer Hudson, I did not remeber she was large. I was surprised. And America is not ugly. I think she is prettier than Jennifer.
Posted By Jogger, Atlanta GA : Wed Jan 17, 12:05:00 PM EST ET Funny, I always wondered why they called the show "Ugly Betty". There are lots of girls who fit into her mold, and they should not be called ugly. I'm glad someone finally brought attention to this
Posted By roy, NC : Wed Jan 17, 12:09:00 PM EST ET What a great article, there is nothing UGLY about America's charaacter Betty Suarez, as a matter of fact if she was real and I was straight I would ask her out!!
Posted By Eric in Dover, DelaWARE : Wed Jan 17, 12:11:00 PM EST ET Interesting that Americans are obsessed with being thin, yet 65% are overweight. Double standards, hmm?
Posted By Katie, Red Bluff, CA : Wed Jan 17, 12:15:00 PM EST ET I agree with her message but I am sick and tired of hearing about how ugly and overweight she is. Look around, most women are bigger and "uglier" than she is. She is well above average in the looks department. I'll believe all the hype when they give us a REAL unattractive role model.Most of this "movement" is just a pathetic response to a very real backlash. Women are sick of being dismissed when we hit 35 or decide that there's more to life than Maybelline and the South Beach diet.Also, we're sick of sitcoms about fat unattractive losers married to hot women. I'm waiting for the reverse.We'd all be happier -- men included -- if we all changed our standards of beauty to something closer to reality, and realized that women have a lot more to offer than sexuality and Bundt cake. Look around. The world needs our influence.Mother Theresa, Susan B. Anthony, Eleanor Roosevelt, Madame Curie, Katherine Graham...these women were beautiful.Are you really "ugly" and proud of it? Stand up and be seen and heard!
Posted By Janet Sorensen, Little Rock, AR : Wed Jan 17, 12:16:00 PM EST ET Does this mean that overweight, insecure people are role models now?This is just one extreme to the other. how about a middle ground. And to use the word "hero" here is pretty disingenuous. The word has totally lost all meaning these days. I don't consider sports figures or actors as heroes just by doing their jobs.
Posted By Jeff, Oak Harbor, WA : Wed Jan 17, 12:18:00 PM EST ET Barbara: I always thought the title was intended to be ironic.
Posted By Amanda, San Diego, California : Wed Jan 17, 12:21:00 PM EST ET I personally find the title very offensive. The show�s goal may be to demolish some of the beauty stereotypes that exist in our society, but in reality I believe it is cementing the perception of what is beautiful and ugly. Should a person be labeled ugly just because she uses little makeup, wears braces and glasses, and dresses plainly? The post by �Showbiz Tonight� describes Betty as �an overweight young woman with braces�� How can they call Betty overweight? Must one be anorexic to not be considered overweight? I agree with America Ferrera in her assessment statement about the character: �I don't really see Betty as ugly. I see her as closer to the real girls I see in life.�I can only imagine the impact the show must be having in nation�s schools kids where teasing less than �kool kids� comes so naturally. Now we have a show that gives them a reference and model to attribute the qualifier �ugly�.
Posted By Roland, Alexandria VA : Wed Jan 17, 12:27:00 PM EST ET I think it's funny that you say America Ferrera is what normal women look like while at the same time calling her overweight and fuller-figured. Which one is she, average or above average?
Posted By Bob, San Diego, CA : Wed Jan 17, 12:31:00 PM EST ET Go America Ferrera, and "Yay" to Showbiz Tonight for your Weight Watch segments! You may be interested to know that there are a group of amazing teens in Atlanta who are DOING something about all these insane pressures! The Eating Disorders Information Network has an outreach program where teens develop campus-wide awareness events during "Love Your Body Week." The teens produce documentaries about food and create artistic displays; they cover the mirrors in the bathrooms with positive affirmations; they put facts about fat and carbs in the lunchroom; they put information about the dangers of purging in locker rooms. These courageous teens are challenging Hollywood beauty ideals, exposing the dangers of extreme weight loss methods, providing healthy ways to cope with stress, and examining America's narrow definitions of beauty. It's important for teens to know that they can speak out and help each other to resist these influences....and by doing so they may be saving lives! You don't have to be a victim of Media Influence! These teens are making changes happen at the grass roots level... Maybe sweet Betty and talented Jennifer Hudson will help change things in Hollywood.

Posted By Dina Zeckhausen, PhD, Atlanta, Georgia : Wed Jan 17, 12:32:00 PM EST ET What's offensive is your grammar, Barbara.
Posted By Jimmy, Salem OH : Wed Jan 17, 12:33:00 PM EST ET Hey, I'm all about women learning to love themselves but we need to stop saying 'its okay to be full figured', because it isn't. Its unheathy and the cause of diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.
Posted By Jennifer, Richmond, VA : Wed Jan 17, 12:35:00 PM EST ET The title of the show isn't offensive, but rather it's ironic.Betty isn't as stylish and physically attractive as the others on the show, but her personality makes her more stunning than any of the other.Get it?
Posted By Veronica, Philadelphia : Wed Jan 17, 12:40:00 PM EST ET To Espy in DC: It IS FerrEra, unless ABC's Web site has it wrong as well:http://abc.go.com/primetime/uglybetty/bios/america_ferrera.html
Posted By Todd Leopold, CNN.com Entertainment Producer : Wed Jan 17, 12:43:00 PM EST ET I agree that the modeling industy's, and Hollywood's, perception of "normal" is skewed. Rail thin and anorexic is unhealthy and IMHO, pretty gross. However, in the effort to steer women away from one extreme, let's not sway them to the other. It's one thing to teach women to be confortable and happy in their own skin, but it isn't okay to give the message that overweight is OK as long as you are happy being overweight. Overweight is unhealthy too, and I think that both America Ferrera and Jennifer Hudson could both stand to lose a few pounds for that reason.
Posted By Nathan, Lake Mary, FL : Wed Jan 17, 12:43:00 PM EST ET I agree with what both America and Jennifer said. They are "real" American women...look around if you don't believe this. Sadly, I think it is the men who continue to encourage woman that thin is beautiful. I found it interesting when the fasion shows in Spain and Italy changed their standards, that the comments I saw from women were positive regarding the BMI limit and encouraging a healthy body image. Every man interviewed (the ones I saw were male designers) were extremely negative about the BMI limit for the models. They believe it is absolutely OK to have an emaciated woman walk down the runway showing off their designs. Sadly, in the real world I have also found this to be true. Having lived as both a fat and thin woman (I have lost 165 lbs), I have really moved from being "invisible" and having doors slammed in my face (really!) to having men jump to open them for me now. My career has skyrocketed since I lost the weight 4 years ago (my salary has literally more than doubled)...this is a sad testiment to our culture I think. It has definitely been facinating to see the world from these different perspectives! As a culture we are learning one thing from our pop-culture, tv, movies, magazines, etc., yet we are told by our parents and others that it is what is inside that counts, etc. and with something like 60% of the population now overweight there is a real contradiction. I think this is causing so much unnecessary grief and stress. Granted most overweight people do need to loose weight, but the expectation that you have to be a size 6, to be beautiful, is just too much. I think our media needs to get more in line with the real world. It is sad that there are only a handful of "real-sized" women on tv and they almost never get the leading part. I am so happy that this subject is even being discussed and brought out into the open. By the way, by no reach of the imagination do I consider "Ugly Betty" to be ugly...I think her beauty just shines through!
Posted By Barbara Embry, Rockville, Maryland : Wed Jan 17, 12:45:00 PM EST ET Lets not promote this too heavily.I don't want to see alot of beautiful women "let themselves go" under the guise of feeling "ok".Yes theres too thin, but there is also such a thing as too thick. This can be just as unhealthy physically and mentally. Ask men what they think before you push this one too far.
Posted By Tim Manville Pa. : Wed Jan 17, 12:46:00 PM EST ET While I applaud America's comments and the sentiment behind them I sincerely wish that people would realize that ALL body types are normal, not just the larger ones. Take it from someone who has literally been told 'if you weren't so skinny you'd be beautiful,' sometimes being thin is just as painful as being 'thick'. I hope that someday people will leave women like Natalie Portman alone about their weight just like they should leave Jennifer Hudson alone. Both are beautiful, elegant women who are carrying the weight that is natural for their body type and health. Please, people, I beg you, don't start persecuting naturally slender women just because of the foolish mentality that you have to be thin to be a viable actress/singer/model.
Posted By Cat, Panama City, FL : Wed Jan 17, 12:47:00 PM EST ET The article was not about the fact that Ugly Betty one, it was about the message that American Ferrera and Jennifer Hudson wants the world to see. Not all skinny is beautiful. Healthy women have curves and should not feel any less confident than a skinny woman. Little girls should not be taught that if they are "fat" by Hollywood (and America's) standards that they are not beautiful.
Posted By T. Olson, Green Bay, WI : Wed Jan 17, 12:48:00 PM EST ET I think it is a GREAT show and America is certainly deserving of the award. Anyone who has ever worked in corporate America can identify with the program.
Posted By Mary, Chicago, IL : Wed Jan 17, 12:49:00 PM EST ET Quick response to all. America is an amazing woman for her performance and there are a lot of amazing people invovled with the show to take a shot on it. Seems beauty runs deep in the cast, crew and producing team.And Barbara, the title is specifically intended to seem offensive, so you can watch the show and see that "ugly" Betty is infact the essence of beauty. It is a play on words so that beauty, or ugly is only skin deep. And in America's case, it take a good costume designer to make her just slightly awkward. Ugly never comes into play.
Posted By Elena, Portsmouth, NH : Wed Jan 17, 12:55:00 PM EST ET I didn't like the name from the very beginning. What does this say about our American society!? and what about the show "I hate Chris". I could not believe the name of that show either. Since when is the work "hate" ok.
Posted By jane doe, raleigh, nc : Wed Jan 17, 12:56:00 PM EST ET I think I would like the show better if they dumped the ugly stereotype of braces and glasses and weird clothes. Anyone can see that this actress is very pretty- why didn't they choose a talented actress who doesn't have to be made "ugly" with props?As far as the weight issue goes... again, what is she? Maybe ten pounds over the accepted weight limit? Only in Hollywood would that be considered both ugly and a guideline for standards.
Posted By Kathy, Rockport ME : Wed Jan 17, 12:56:00 PM EST ET I find it interestesting that you describe Ferrera and her character as "overweight", then later on go on to say that its your mission to resist "standards that make women feel ridiculously guilty for looking and feeling normal." You might want to consider how you're doing on your mission, as overall, Ferrara's character is NORMAL. She is anything but the image that a term like "overweight" projects. Pick on or another. Is being bigger than a size 6/8 normal? Or is it overweight? How about a size 12? It certainly isn't fat, I'd say its average. Normal. I am saddened by the fact that, in the same article, you contricted yourself like this.
Posted By Nic, KC, MO : Wed Jan 17, 12:57:00 PM EST ET I hate the show's title "Ugly Betty." I think it should be called "Beautiful Betty." Beauty is completely subjective and encompasses more than just what one looks like.Besides - America is beautiful!
Posted By Wendy, Windsor, CA : Wed Jan 17, 01:02:00 PM EST ET It all sounds nice about all the 'normal' girls out there and wanting to encourage them, but look at the producer, Selma Hayak who herself has taken to the knife to make herself not so 'normal'. What a joke!
Posted By Sue Cunningham, New York, NY : Wed Jan 17, 01:06:00 PM EST ET Thank you Dave Levine :) I completely agree!!! After battling bulimia for years, I'm finally accepting that my curvy size 12 is the healthiest and sexiest for me and screw the anyone else who wants me to feel otherwise. And Barbara, it's WON, not one like the #1.
Posted By Linda, Danbury, CT : Wed Jan 17, 01:12:00 PM EST ET The actress is lovely and talented, and I'm sure deserves her award. But I've always wondered why the sho'w producers had to get a pretty woman and drab her down: they couldn't find a nice, talented 'ugly' actress? That says a lot about Hollywood and America (the country), and dilutes the message the show seems to be trying to promote (with blatant hypocrisy).Of course, if they had found a chubby, drab actress who made a splash, how long would it be before she and they slimmed her down and prettied her up so she would fit in with the plastic barbi dolls that pass as actresses today?
Posted By Gloira, Phoenix, AZ : Wed Jan 17, 01:21:00 PM EST ET I love Ugly Betty and America and I have to agree with this blog. The Golden Globes won for the show and its star were both well deserved. It is one of the best shows on TV today and the chemistry between the actors is so perfect. I am addicted to this show and I hope everyone can check it out at least once just to see that not only is beauty just skin deep but women that are thicker than others are no less talented than anyone else and they do have a lot to offer.
Posted By Nicole, Buffalo, NY : Wed Jan 17, 01:27:00 PM EST ET I have no problem with the actress I must agree with a previous blogger who said that although she represents the real american girl, the use of the word ugly is too much. Furthermore, there is an epidemic of overweight people and you know where that leads to? Huge healthcare costs. So, I don't think that overweight people should characters should be encouraged in our tv screens.
Posted By Benny, NYC,NY : Wed Jan 17, 01:43:00 PM EST ET Hudon will have a short shelf life.The Dreamgirls part was taylor made for Hudson, unfortunately for her there just aren't many parts out there for big woman who sing. She will be fighting for parts with Queen Latifa, not exactly a great actress herself.As for Ferrera, while the concept of the underdog is sweet, she really doesn't add to much in the way of acting to the show. They could get a robot to act as good as she does.
Posted By Luis, Queens : Wed Jan 17, 01:44:00 PM EST ET to alan virginia beach - When you say Long Live Female Beauty, exactly what do you mean? We all know that beauty is subjective, or in the eye of the beholder, as the old saying goes. What one person may find beautiful, another may find unattractive. I am sick to death of people just looking at the outer superficial appearance, without taking into account what is inside a person. What about qualities such as charm, wit, charisma? I have seen many actresses that are average looking, but they seem to be beautiful due to the power of their presence and their inner confidence. That can make someone appear more attractive than just what you see on the outside. I don't believe that you can quantify beauty. I think it defies categorizing and stereotyping. But the one thing I know is that I do not want a world where men all think like Donald Trump and objectify women and value them only for their pretty face and great body. Even women that do fit the Donald's very selective and narrow definition of beauty, still want to be valued for other qualities, such as intelligence, compassion, humor and so on. I thought America Ferrera's speech was eloquent, heartwarming and much needed in this shallow world of today. The show is great and has a wonderful message for all young girls and even grown women like myself. It's great to look good and be appreciated for that, but it's also nice to be seen as a whole human being, with feelings and ideas and thoughts that matter. That is what I celebrate with the win for America and Ugly Betty at the Golden Globes. How fitting it was that Trump was sitting right there in the audience when America gave her speech. But, knowing him, it probably was way over his inflated, egotistical head.
Posted By Mindy Chatsworth, Ca. : Wed Jan 17, 01:49:00 PM EST ET Being overweight (ie Jennifer Hudson) is not a virtue
Posted By Anonymous : Wed Jan 17, 02:05:00 PM EST ET First of all, no one has even mentioned the fact that these two women are not caucasian, and are built differently as ethnic women. It's a simple fact that your race effects your physical build and to ignore that is...well, ignorant. Secondly, we know nothing about their personal lives or health, so making judgements saying they are "overweight" is ridiculous. Anyone know their BMI's? Or if they are on medication that could cause a weight gain or plataeu? Both girls appear happy, healthy and confident in their own bodies, and THAT is what we should be applauding in our role models.
Posted By Tracey, Chicago, IL : Wed Jan 17, 02:06:00 PM EST ET People have been singing the praises of thin women for YEARS. So some "heavier" women are receiving this praise now, what's the big deal? All this shows is that there's enough praise and criticism to go around. None of this would matter if one's appearance didn't play such a large role in the treatment they receive from others.
Posted By Jen, Olney, MD : Wed Jan 17, 02:06:00 PM EST ET ... maybe it's time to re-name the show "Beautiful Betty."Ugly comes from the inside ..
Posted By Alison Carnie, Chicago, IL : Wed Jan 17, 02:08:00 PM EST ET The fashion industry, women's magazines, mass media, and movies are ALL culprits in the war on women's bodies. We should be learning how to eat better and exercise. Moreover, we should be learning how to accept ourselves for who we are, not someone else's version of who THEY think we should be. TV is a bad place to go for truth. Just look at how many TV shows have mediocre, doughboy looking "husbands" who are married to good-looking, svelte "wives"?! There is a double-standard at work, and we should expose it. Instead we talk about the same-old stuff and never get to the real truth of the matter. Americans are obsessed with things that don't matter much in the grand scheme. Open your eyes, free your minds, and your booties will follow.
Posted By Jewell, Kansas City, Missouri : Wed Jan 17, 02:16:00 PM EST ET Please, I don't not know why she won. I do watch the show and Betty is kind of annoying. The show is average and she is not my favorite character. There is nothing wrong with being Ugly. God did not intend for us all to look the same. We all come in different shapes and sizes. Not everyone is overeating or starving themself. God did not intend for all of us to be thick or thin or skinny or whatever. People need to shut up. All that should matter is how you treat others. Nobody should take the Hollywood foreign press seriously. They only gave her the award because her show is the talk of the town right now.
Posted By cordelia, Schenectady, NY : Wed Jan 17, 02:16:00 PM EST ET Elena and Veronica - You are so right...can't anyone see that the word "ugly" was meant to be ironic? And Alan and Tim, unless you are getting back waxes, working out every day, and worrying about hair transplants, you have no right to judge women that have higher priorities than anorexia and trips to the mall.Bravo for celebrating women for more than their ability to diet!
Posted By Kim, Vancouver, bc : Wed Jan 17, 02:18:00 PM EST ET If it is your "mission to resist Hollywood's persistent beauty-definition pressure" then don't refer to people as "fuller-figured."
Posted By Bethanny, Indiana : Wed Jan 17, 02:23:00 PM EST ET I know it seems silly to some people, but I'm another naturally "skinny" girl who feels the backlash- It's true that people do make comments about it that would never be made to people who are overweight. Thin people are not necessarily anorexic or image obsessed just as overweight people are not necessarily lazy.. we're all just people.
Posted By Margaret- Chicago, IL : Wed Jan 17, 02:35:00 PM EST ET I love how suddenly everyone wants to praise fatness and pretend like being skinny is somehow bad, unattractive or makes one worthy of being criticized or mocked.Do you realize how hypocritical you are when you praise the fat girl or guy and ridicule the skinny one?The door swings both ways here folks. Don't complain how fat people are made fun of in one breath and then turn around and do the same to a skinny person.At least I'm honest with my feelings... fatness is unhealthy and unattractive. A lean and well-kept body is healthier. I didn't say anorexic... I said lean and well-kept.Seriously, why are we trying to pretend otherwise?
Posted By Scott, Cleveland, OH : Wed Jan 17, 02:39:00 PM EST ET I find it insulting that you classify Betty/America as overweight. Yes, she's "overweight" when compared to her co-workers in the fashion industry, but I'm betting that she's a size 10, maybe a size 12. When the average American woman is a size 14, Betty/America is not average nor overweight. I think she's portraying a more realistic view of American women but to say she's overweight is negligent and plain wrong.
Posted By Jennifer, Houston, Texas : Wed Jan 17, 02:40:00 PM EST ET I think the people who hate the title of the show "Ugly Betty" are missing the irony. Betty is not ugly, but is perceived as such by the fashion industry. She and America are attractive.
Posted By mike, raleigh, nc : Wed Jan 17, 02:47:00 PM EST ET Fist of all, is not my intention to insult anyone by giving my personal comment about this issue. I have not watched "Ugly Betty" yet, but I have heard what's about. I have watched "Las Fea Mas Bella" Which is the Mexican version and it's my understanding that it's pretty much the same version. Now we all need to understand that every one was born differently. Some of us were born skinny, some of us were born heavy and some of us were born average people. This doesn't mean that just because we are heavy, or skinny or average makes us ugly. The point is, that is in our hands to make ourselves look beautiful not just from the outside, but from the inside. I have seen so many girls who were born heavy weight and are beautiful all the way, because their self esteem is up and they don't go by what people is going to think about them. For example, I was given the opportunity to be part of the Barbizon Modeling Agency. When I was choosen to be one of the 300 girls they were looking for, I was glad and blessed to see that they choose not just skinny girls like me, but heavy looking ones as well, whose self esteem was so down and most of them thought that they were not going to make it because of their appearance. But they did! It all about you! don't let others think that you're ugly, just because you are heavy or too skinny. We are all God's creation and we were all made special in our individual ways and men have different taste, some of them like them skinny some of them like them thin and some they just like all about you it doesn't matter how you look and they love you the way you are. I once feel ugly and looked ugly, but that's because I was too busy hearing negative things and not doing or taking the positive comments in action. Believe me, life is about decisions, we are constantly making them one way or anothe by choosing a restaurant to eat dinner or by choosing to go to college or not. Make a decision to believe in you and treat yourself with respect and people will see that and they will start doing the same as well.Let's all have a great day!Sandra N. Marquez,
Posted By Sandra N. Marquez, Morganton, NC : Wed Jan 17, 03:16:00 PM EST ET For those of you who are saying that women shouldn't embrace being large because it's unhealthy: a little perspective. Even though you think women shouldn't accept themselves as they are, the exact opposite is true. As a matter of fact, everyone should accept them. I'm currently in a Master's program in psychology - with a health psychology emphasis. In my studies, I ran across experiments showing that rejection actually causes a reduction in people's ability to self-regulate, so when we reject people for being fat, we're actually contributing to their inability to stop overeating. You worsen the problem you're trying to help. People who are rejected go into survival mode because they are emotionally threatened. Without a therapeutic environment, people cannot change.
Posted By Kat, Los Angeles CA : Wed Jan 17, 03:18:00 PM EST ET Oh well, I'm fat and ugly so I guess I don't deserve any kind of human decency, right scott?Nevermind that I had cancer and went through chemotherapy that destroyed my pancreas and liver and my ability to digest. No, people like you think I eat all my meals at McDonalds and that I'm not worthy of any kind of decency. You make me sick. Your ilk has been raised to want a playboy bunny in every bedroom and a calendar girl in every kitchen. Here's a newsflash, looks fade. Beauty is fleeting.Good luck getting Cindy Crawford to marry you.Never judge a person until you've walked a mile in their shoes.
Posted By Jen, Victoria, BC, Canada : Wed Jan 17, 03:33:00 PM EST ET "women who are tired of the often unrealistic body image messages that Hollywood sends"???????? Are you kidding me???? This has nothing to do with Hollywood and if you want to think that it does then you're just looking for someone other than yourself to blame. If you think you have to be beautiful, then you are pretentious and the problem lies within you. The problem isn't Hollywood's "persistent beauty-definition pressure" - it's YOU and your pretentiousness.
Posted By Chris Phillips, Kansas City, MO : Wed Jan 17, 03:36:00 PM EST ET I am very happy to see the America won. She is a bright and talented women and should be proud. There is nothing wrong with being normal. Cheers for her.
Posted By Arlene Battle Creek, Michigan : Wed Jan 17, 03:53:00 PM EST ET By using the title "Ugly Betty" the producers were declaring that Betty was indeed ugly. To have this statement that, well, I don't see Betty as ugly is ludicrous. If she felt that way, she would have insisted along with the not ugly Salma Hayek that the show be merely called Betty. Instead, they wanted to let us dumb tv watchers know that it was "okay" to think that Betty was ugly from the get go. I suggest they drop the Ugly all together. No one is ugly in real life. There is always some one who will find them attractive. Nuff said.
Posted By Ellen H., Santa Cruz CA : Wed Jan 17, 03:58:00 PM EST ET Think the show sucks and I am offended that someone would name their child "America"
Posted By Johnny B, Monroe, MI : Wed Jan 17, 04:15:00 PM EST ET I read a few of the posts and I just wanted to make a few points. First of all, nobody ever said that the show is called Ugly Betty because America Ferrara is ugly, or the character she plays is ugly. The show is called Ugly Betty because it is based on a Columbian soap by the same name, "Betty La Fea." Secondly, anyone could be made to look a lot more attractive with haute couture and professional makeup and hair. So why are we focusing on how attractive the actress is and how this somehow disqualifies her from the role? Riciculous!My third point is that we automatically have to turn any event into a battle. No one said that it is not okay to be thin. Some people are born with thin genes and they will always be thin. It would be unfortunate if these people started to hurt themselves by eating unhealthy foods in excess. The point I think that was tryig to be made is that there are people out there without thin genes that do exactly that, hurt themselves. They do it by not eating, binging and purging or exercising too much in order to be thin. And they do it because the images we see all around us value "thin" over anything else.And to the person who said that embracing actresses like America or Jennifer may only make the obesity problem in this country worse, do some homework. It has been proven that the more that Americans have subjected themselves to diets, the heavier they've become. A person who feels terribly overweight (and is actually only 15 lbs overweight) starts a diet and eventually ends up developing an obsession which can lead to an eating disorder like bulimia, anorexia or binge-eating and eventually, she will put on more weight. Turns out those 15 lbs she had to lose because all of those fashion models and actresses we see who work out 4 hours a day may have been her perfect weight. Bravo to actresses like America, Jennifer, and Sara Ramirez of Grey's Anatomy for reminding us that sexy comes in all shapes and sizes.
Posted By Noni, San Francisco, CA : Wed Jan 17, 04:18:00 PM EST ET Thank you, thank you to those of you who recognize that the title "Ugly Betty" is mean to be ironic! I'm shocked how many people don't get that... and that they can get so easily offended. Geez!America's speech was heartwarming and I was happy both she and the show won. It really is a great show all around and the cast really seems to click. Congrats to them all.
Posted By Marie, Washington, DC : Wed Jan 17, 04:28:00 PM EST ET Ugly is a prefectly appropriate word to use. Try as you might, you will never make every one look first at someones inner beauty or whatever you call what you use to mask a lack of physical beauty. She is not repersentative a a healthy average woman. being over weight is not healty no matter how much someone cries about it. you do more harm trying to make people believe that extra weight is ok and is the norm and not harmfull as it really is.
Posted By Matt orem utah : Wed Jan 17, 05:13:00 PM EST ET Amen!!!
Posted By Heather Maravola, South Elgin, IL : Wed Jan 17, 05:29:00 PM EST ET I find it hard to believe that she has the audicity to suggest we stop using the word "ugly". Meanwhile the girl is making money off the word.
Posted By Crowley, Kings Mtn NC : Wed Jan 17, 05:50:00 PM EST ET who remembers the twilight zone episode 'eye of the beholder?'Men prefer a woman with curves not a stick figure, boys like the stick thin model types. being overweight versus normal is different, ribs should not be countable but an inner tube isn't appealing either.
Posted By Rex Anderson, Overland Park KS : Wed Jan 17, 05:51:00 PM EST ET Betty Suarez isn't really overweight... she's pretty normal in size. Plus, she wears frumpy, baggy clothing.America Ferrera is hands down gorgeous.
Posted By Josh, Eugene, OR : Wed Jan 17, 06:17:00 PM EST ET Overweight? I think you mean normal weight? Or do you really not have a clue what women look like? That one word seems to belie the rest of your post. Yoe seem to display some of the same bias you claim to be railing against. Betty (and Ms. Ferrara) simply looks FEMININE; unlike the typical Hollywood waif, who looks like a boy. As for those who find the title or concept offensive - you are missing the point! She is NOT ugly. It is her shallow co-workers who think so. Are you as shallow as they are? If you watched the most recent episode, you should realize that it is Salma Hayek playing the ugly character.
Posted By Patrick C. Portland, OR : Wed Jan 17, 07:28:00 PM EST ET So is she "normal" or "overweight"? You are still labeling her as "overweight" when she is just normal. I do believe we should be concerned about our weight whether we are overweight or underweight because of health issues. However, I would not put "Betty" in the overweight category.
Posted By Angela, Austin TX : Wed Jan 17, 08:17:00 PM EST ET Some people seem to miss the point of the show and the title "Ugly Betty." Initially, I too was put off by the title but I now see that is it meant to be ironic. Betty works in the fashion industry which is extremely image conscious. In that world, she is "ugly". I have heard Andre Talley of Vogue Magazine interviewed several times indicating that the Editor in Chief (for whom Meryl Streep's character in Devil Wears Prada is supposedly based) Anna Wintour, does not like fat women and doesn't want overweight women working at the magazine. Even Oprah had to go on a diet in order to be considered worthy of being on the cover, so I don't think the show is far off in that respect.The show is meant to highlight who is really beautiful. Those who are rail thin, wear designer clothes but have horrible attitudes or a normal, smart, pretty, kind woman like Betty.Those of you who are not watching are missing out. Not only does the show feature various standards of beauty but I also like that it has a culturally diverse cast which you don't see that much of in TV. I also believe America is a great role model for young women of all races.I loved her in Real Women Have Curves and wish her continued success with Ugly Betty.
Posted By SG Memphis, TN : Wed Jan 17, 11:24:00 PM EST ET Did you know the formula for Ugly Betty hads been done in a couple different countries? In Germany it was called "Verliebt in Berlin"(In love in Berlin)
Posted By Kathy Schaller Friesenheim Germany : Thu Jan 18, 03:13:00 AM EST ET I liked America's speech. It's very true in today's society, especially in when it comes to tv/movies or modeling. However it's contradictory that the name of the show is "Ugly Betty." And a side note, unfortunately, I also disagree with her winning the award. While the show has its moments and she does well, she's not the best actress in that category and that show is far from being the best/funniest on tv. I almost feel like it won because of the issue of weight and beauty as opposed to the quality of the show. But America had a nice speech and did a nice job accepting.
Posted By Kristine, Minneapolis, MN : Thu Jan 18, 09:45:00 AM EST ET I had the wonderful oportunity to meet America while she was in Toronto on a promtional tour for her movie "Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants" and I must say she was so humble and sweet. America is one star who is totally deserving of all the success that is coming her way. Keep up the amazing work America because we will all be cheering you on
Posted By Megan O. Toronto, ON, Canada : Fri Jan 19, 08:53:00 AM EST ET I'm happy to see this issue is actually getting attention. I am overweight and have struggled with this problem all my life, fluctuating between a size 10 and at my biggest a size 20. Part of my problem was the way I was brought up to believe I SHOULD look - "double digits in sizes aren't attractive" as I was often told by friends, family, even teachers. I am very happy that truly talented individuals like America and Jennifer are actually recognized for what they can do, not the way they look. Perhaps if we focused more on talent and less on beauty, this country wouldn't be afflicted with so many image-related illnesses. The most important thing for people to realize is that we are who we are, and we should only try to change if we really want to change ... not try to fit in to some manufactured image of what we should be. Big or small, all different types of women can be and are beautiful in their own way.
Posted By Ashley, Arlington, TX : Mon Jan 22, 12:35:00 PM EST ET I watched this show for the forst time tonight and I AGREE.AT first you see her LOOKS and think. OH WOW!BUT THEN?SHE comes alive and you see her real potential.I LOVE it and will watch this show religiously!!!!THANKS to BETTY!
