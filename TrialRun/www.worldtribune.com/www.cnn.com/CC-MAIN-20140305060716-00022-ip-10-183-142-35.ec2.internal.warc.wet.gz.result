How astronauts stay fit, on and off the planetStory Highlights A new exercise machine sent to space station functions like a weight machine Astronaut Clay Anderson says space travel is generally physically easy People can be accepted to space program even if in bad shape, trainer says Prepping for the long journey to Mars is the focus of a nutritional study Next Article in Health » By Elizabeth Landau CNN	(CNN) -- Being in space is like being Superman every day, says Clay Anderson, a NASA astronaut from Omaha, Nebraska. At the international space station, where he spent five months last year, he flew to breakfast, work and the bathroom. Shuttle Endeavour is delivering the advanced Resistive Exercise Device to the international space station. But floating around in zero-G can have some serious consequences for the human body, NASA's experts have learned, including the weakening of bones. In fact, studies have shown that space travelers can lose 1 to 2 percent of their bone mass each month on average, according to NASA. One way that astronauts have been fighting bone loss is through strength training. And they're getting some help with a new machine delivered this week by the shuttle Endeavour, which docked with the international space station on Sunday. The advanced Resistive Exercise Device, aRED for short, functions like a weight machine in a gym on Earth, except it has no conventional weights. Instead, it has vacuum cylinders -- canisters with air that have had a vacuum applied -- that provide concentric workloads up to 600 pounds, NASA says. The device works somewhat like a bicycle pump, only in reverse, said Mark Guilliams, a NASA trainer. For example, if you are squatting, the vacuum gets pulled out as you stand up, and when you squat back down, the vacuum pulls the bar back to the normal position. Between the vacuum cans and the bar, there are small flywheels that spin in opposite directions, creating an artificial gravity when someone lifts the bar. Don't Miss Endeavour docks with space station
Astronauts can do upper and lower-body exercises, such as squats, dead lift, heel raises, bicep curls and bench press on the device, NASA said. "In the movie, the 'Transformers,' it looks like one of those things that unfolds into some kind of big monster," Anderson said. "It's huge." The existing exercise device on the space station has a mechanism that more closely resembles a rubber band. The farther you pull the rubber band, the more force you generate, Guilliams said. The limitations of this device made it somewhat boring, Anderson said. The new device will allow astronauts do many more kinds of exercises than the old one. The tradeoff is its larger size, Anderson said. It will be in use almost constantly during the day, assuming astronauts work out about two hours a day each, he said. The international space station also is equipped with a treadmill and a bicycle, Guilliams said. So what's the difference between exercising on Earth and working out on the international space station? "When you run outside on Earth, you've got 195 pounds smacking against the pavement every time you take a step," said Anderson, who weighs 195 pounds on Earth. "In zero gravity, you're trying to use bungees to hold you down." The treadmill has clip harnesses to hold an astronaut down, such that the fewer clips used, the more force acts around the legs, making running more difficult, he said. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Fitness and nutrition
Using the previous exercise device on the space station wasn't so different from a cable machine in a weight room on Earth, he said. "Instead of lifting a big piece of iron, you're basically pulling against a gear or a can," he said. "I think they were very similar in terms of feel." Both before and after space travel, astronauts go through the same kinds of exercises familiar to athletes and others who exercise on Earth, Guilliams said -- aerobic activity such as running, and weight training. Astronauts training for a flight have scheduled exercise time two or three times a week for two hours each session, but in unscheduled time, they'll go for a run, he said. But people who want to leave the planet must be in really great shape, right? Guilliams says that's not the case -- as long as a person is healthy and has no cardiovascular problems, he or she can, in theory, can become a NASA astronaut, even if out of shape. For Anderson, who played football in college and has been athletic for much of his life, space travel was "physically easy." Space walks did get fatiguing because they required him to use his forearms, hands and upper body, which don't get much exercise on Earth. "On Earth, you tend to use your big muscle group, and in space you tend to use your smaller muscle group, especially on a space walk when you use your forearms and your hands almost exclusively," he said. Anderson lost only 4 percent of his body mass in his 152 days off the planet, compared with the expected 12 to 16 percent, he said. He also exercised for two-and-a-half hours a day for 151 out of the 152 days, he said. Returning to Earth on the shuttle Discovery last November, Anderson walked off the orbiter with a little assistance, and it only took him about 24 hours to walk and stand normally again. He credits this speedy recovery to his frequent use of the exercise equipment on the space station. Combating bone loss is one of the challenges that the space program has, especially given the goal of a mission to Mars. An ongoing study is measuring how much astronauts who stay on board the international space station eat and exercise, Anderson said. The experiment will determine what kinds of dietary supplements astronauts should take in addition to the food they eat, and also the appropriate level and type of exercise they should get, he said. "I think they're making some good strides in figuring out how to keep people healthy on a six- to nine-month trip to Mars," he said, although experts are still a long way away from figuring out the bone loss issue for a round-trip journey of about two years.

Soldier's letters give first-hand look at Spanish flu pandemicStory Highlights U.S. soldier survived Spanish flu pandemic not once, but twice 1918 Spanish flu ravaged military camps where soldiers trained for WWI Letter says camp put "under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza" Martin "Al" Culhane in letter told his brother to keep infection secret from rest of family Next Article in U.S. » ReadEXPLAINER By Larry Shaughnessy CNN Pentagon producer Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic rising daily, CNN Pentagon producer Larry Shaughnessy remembered a batch of letters from his grandfather, a World War I soldier who battled the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919. Martin "Al" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- "I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe" As World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. "The boys are just starting to sing," Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. "They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far." Stephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends. But Culhane, known as "Al," and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War. They would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history. Culhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time "chum" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war. Three weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again. Already the flu occupies his thoughts. Learn more about the current swine flu » "Received a nice letter from Phil Byrne he reports he is getting along fine, is feeling better than he has ever before." Byrne, a friend from Chicago, was one of the early survivors of the Spanish flu. Other members of the Byrne family took ill a few months later, according to the letters. In the same letter he mentions how the Army was trying to protect the troops at Camp Forrest: "Since noon today our camp has been under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza. We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company." That same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, "Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition." At first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: "I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies." Don't Miss First swine flu death reported in U.S.

Just six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: "Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family." What Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from "my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather." His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died. In the United States the mortality rate was lower, but still a devastating 3 percent. It was a crisis for the Army. Military bases, with thousands of men from all over the country in tightly packed barracks, were fertile breeding grounds for the flu, especially one as easily spread as this one. And unlike most flu strains that mostly strike the elderly, the very young or the sick, Spanish flu hit healthy, young adults like Army draftees. Just three days after telling his friend about being sick, Culhane wrote that he was feeling better. "I am still in quarantine but will be released today. I am feeling great and the two day's rest has done me a world of good. I have done nothing at all but sit in the shade, read and write letters." His recovery from the Spanish flu was swift, but the very next day, October 7, 1918, he wrote to give "all the details of the death of a very good friend, my Bunkie, Thomas Birdie. His body will go north today, I think," Culhane wrote, asking Pinter to attend the wake. "At his side, say a few prayers for the repose of his soul." When not writing about the flu, Culhane dropped none-too-subtle hints about wanting care packages full of cookies from home. And he regularly questioned why other friends didn't write. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Influenza (flu)
He also worried that he was "neglecting the ladies." He pelts his friend Clif with questions about Ursula ("Her Majesty," he jokingly refers to her), Ella (the young woman to whom he promised a prized golf club) Ida ("I had a long letter from Ida Flynn. Boy! I will have a job on my hands when I get home") and the Marys (Mary Rose, Mary English, Mary Anne). While Culhane writes about and to a lot of young ladies, there is no sign in the letters which one, if any, held a special place in his heart. Still he worried about one young man named "Hank" who remained in Chicago. "Keep the ladies amused by all means, but I look to you to protect my interests. Hank is too darn nice a chap to be safe around the ladies. However, if he seems to get extra strong I will write a note and have him made Admiral of the Arctic Circle." After recovering from the flu, Culhane bemoans the fact that war was about to end. "It is almost over now and thirty days will see at least a cessation of hostilities. Xmas will see peace. I will never see France and as long as that is impossible I might as well be out of the Army as soon as it is over." Nine days later, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the war ended. And just four days after the fighting in Europe ended, the letters from Camp Forrest stopped. Al Culhane was sick again. This time he was taken to U.S. General Hospital #14 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. And he couldn't keep the latest illness a secret from his family back home in Chicago. A Catholic chaplain wrote the family that he was sick and not able to write himself. When he was well enough, he wrote Pinter, "I don't know just what I have but it felt like old fashioned grip or perhaps 'The Flu.'". It took about two weeks before he was out of the Fort Oglethorpe hospital and back at Camp Forrest. He had twice survived the deadliest flu in history and lived to write home about it. After his second recovery his concerns turned to getting back to Chicago by Christmas. "Clif I have seen my discharge all written out and from that moment on my usefulness as a soldier ceased." But again illness got in the way. This time it was a completely different one: "Measles has broken out in our company and we are quarantined. Did you ever hear of harder luck in all your life?" Culhane didn't make it back to Chicago for Christmas. But he eventually did return home alive and well. He never did make it to France, but traveled the United States extensively with his wife, Evelyn, a woman never mentioned in his letters home, but someone he'd known since they went through First Holy Communion together. As for Clif Pinter, who saved the letters, he and Al Culhane remained "old chums" for life. After Pinter's death, his son passed the letters on to Al's daughter, Dorothy Clarke, who passed them onto Al's grandchildren, including Lawrence Aloysius Shaughnessy, who works for CNN's Pentagon unit and occasionally writes stories about soldiers for CNN.com.

Tensions rise as deadly border clash erupts between Israel, LebanonBy the CNN Wire Staff Lebanese army soldiers monitor movements across the border with Israel on Tuesday as UNIFIL trroops look on. STORY HIGHLIGHTSDiffering narratives emerge from Israeli, Lebanese sidesHezbollah leader denounces Israel in speech marking 2006 warAn Israeli officer, Lebanese soldiers and a journalist are killed in Tuesday's clashIsraeli tank fired shells into Lebanese territory, Lebanese army says Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A clash between Lebanon and Israel along their volatile shared border Tuesday left an Israeli officer and several Lebanese soldiers dead while escalating fears of renewed violence between the nations. Lt. Col. Dov Harari, a battalion commander, was killed in the fighting, according to an Israel Defense Forces statement. Another Israeli soldier was seriously wounded, it said. A Lebanese army spokesman said at least two Lebanese soldiers were killed and several others were wounded. Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that journalist Assaf Abu Rahal also was killed in the exchange of fire between Lebanese and Israeli soldiers. In a statement, the spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon "took immediate steps through contacts with the parties and the presence of the acting force commander alongside peacekeepers at the location to help restore calm in the area." UNIFIL will investigate the incident, it said, adding that Ban "urges the parties to exercise maximum restraint and to work with UNIFIL and the U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon in taking steps to consolidate the calm now restored in the area." Video: Lebanese and Israeli troops trade fire

Two separate narratives emerged about the incident. Israel said the Lebanese fired on Israeli soldiers who were on the Israeli side of the border. In Jerusalem, Israeli Intelligence Minister Dan Meridor said the incident was captured on video and that it all occurred on Israeli soil. "This is all under Israeli sovereignty," he said. "Somebody wanted to ignite fire and kill one of our soldiers and wound another. We responded in a military way. But this should serve as a warning: Don't dare do this again." Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned the Lebanese government against continuing provocations of Israeli forces and demanded an investigation into Tuesday's violence. He said Israel would not tolerate attacks on Israeli territory. "The IDF will continue to act firmly and determinedly to protect the residents of Israel and the sovereign borders of Israel," Barak said in a written statement. The Israeli military said its soldiers were on "routine activity" when the incident occurred. It issued a statement saying that the soldiers were in "an area that lies between the 'blue line' [the internationally recognized border between Israel and Lebanon] and the security fence, thus within Israeli territory." The Lebanese army's account and a report from Lebanese media said, however, that the hostilities occurred when Israel wanted to remove a tree. A Lebanese army unit stopped the Israelis, and the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon intervened, the National News Agency said. The Lebanese army said it asked the U.N. force to arbitrate the issue, but the Israeli forces didn't comply and entered Lebanese territory. That led the army to open fire, with Israeli forces returning artillery fire and hitting a house in the village of Odaise. But Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Israel violated U.N. Resolution 1701 in crossing the blue line and by bombing a Lebanese army checkpoint in Odaise. He said Israeli aggression needs "to be confronted, whatever the sacrifices are" and that he will pursue the issue diplomatically. Israel fought a five-week war with Hezbollah in summer 2006 after Lebanese-based militants kidnapped two Israeli soldiers during a cross-border raid. Resolution 1701, which was intended to resolve the 2006 conflict, bars Israel from conducting military operations in Lebanon. Israel has accused Lebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States, of violating the resolution by smuggling arms into southern Lebanon. In a televised speech marking the fourth anniversary of the war, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah accused Israel of never having stopped its attacks on Lebanon and said it is guilty of 7,000 violations of Resolution 1701. "We salute the Lebanese army and we salute their commander, their soldiers and their officers for baptizing the land with their blood," Nasrallah said. "Our young men were in Odaise and other neighboring villages in the south but we asked them to exercise restraint. We were ready to fight and defend our land." In the aftermath of the 2006 fighting, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers to the area. The U.N. troops were focused Tuesday on restoring calm, said spokesman Neeraj Singh. Acting Commander Brig. Gen. Santi Bonfanti flew to Odaise and said the situation had quieted. The United Nations was urging Israel and Lebanon "to exercise maximum restraint," Singh said. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri had discussed the potentially explosive situation with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian Prime Minister Samir Rifai, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Hariri's office said. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stated Syria's support for Lebanon "against the heinous aggression launched by Israel," according to the Syrian state-run news agency SANA. "This aggression proves once more," he said, "that Israel has always been seeking to destabilize security and stability in Lebanon and the region." In Washington, the Obama administration expressed concern about the clashes and urged both sides to exert calm while the United Nations investigates. State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters the State Department was in touch with the Israelis, Lebanese and the UNIFIL, the United Nations mission on the ground, to establish the facts. But Hezbollah leader Nasrallah predicted any U.N. investigation would not favor Lebanon. "Israel wasn't condemned for massacres that they have committed," he said. "The U.N. will not condemn their aggression in Odaise." Still, he predicted, the incident is not likely to turn into another war. "I don't believe that there is a likelihood of a[nything] close to war but there is reason for concern," he said. Nasrallah further accused Israel of involvement in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in Beirut. He promised to present evidence of Israel's involvement to reporters on Monday. "We officially accuse Israel in Hariri's assassination," he said. "We will expose the true killer." To that, Israel's Meridor was unequivocal. "It is ridiculous," he said. "It's not the first time that he says lies. It's easy for him." CNN's Saad Abedine, Nada Husseini and Michal Zippori contributed to this report.

Report: Iranian warships dock in Sudan in show of support
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 8:28 PM EDT, Tue October 30, 2012
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (L) meets with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Khartoum on September 26, 2011.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two Iranian warships are at Port Sudan, Sudanese state media report
Their visit is a show of support and friendship, Iran and Sudan say
An airstrike destroyed an arms factory in Sudan last week; Iran and Sudan blame Israel
Sudan denies that the factory was producing arms for Iran or its allies
(CNN) -- Two Iranian warships have docked in Sudan carrying "a message of support and friendship," Sudanese state media said.
The ships arrived in Port Sudan on Sunday and will stay until Wednesday, according to SUNA, the official Sudanese news agency.
The presence "clearly shows the solid support of political and diplomatic relationships between the Sudanese and Iranian navies," the agency quoted Sudanese army spokesman Savarmi Khaled Saad as saying Monday.
The warships arrived less than a week after a weapons factory in Khartoum was bombed, killing two people, in what Sudanese officials said was an airstrike by Israel.
Sudan blames Israel for weapons factory blast
Talking tough on Iran
Israel has declined to comment on the attack in the east African country. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing last Tuesday.
The Sudanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday condemning what it called "a brutal assault carried out by the State of Israel" on the Yarmouk Industrial Complex, SUNA said.
It also dismissed suggestions that the weapons factory was manufacturing arms for Iran or its allies, denying "any link between the Sudanese military manufacturing output and any external party," according to SUNA
The statement accused Israel of using "misleading leaks" to the media to allege that the factory had ties "to the states of Iran and Syria and to the Islamic Resistance Movement in Palestine (Hamas), and to Hezbollah in Lebanon."
Iran has no need for weapons to be manufactured in Sudan, the Foreign Ministry statement insisted.
That assertion was repeated Monday by IRNA, Iran's state-run news agency.
Iran last week condemned what it also says was an Israeli airstrike on Khartoum, and it called the strike a clear violation of international laws, according to the news agency.
An Iranian flotilla that left Iranian waters in September included a navy helicopter carrier and a destroyer, IRNA reported.
It "aimed to echo the message of peace and friendship to the neighboring states and guarantee security of the seafaring and shipping lines vis-a-vis sea piracy," the news agency said.
CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.

Penn State supporters mark anniversary of Joe Paterno's death
By CNN Staff
updated 9:45 PM EST, Tue January 22, 2013
Loyal fans gather Tuesday at a mural depicting late football coach Joe Paterno and other Penn State luminaries.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dozens of fans stop by mural depicting famous Penn State figures The coach had many of his victories stripped from his record Paterno was fired after Jerry Sandusky was arrested on child sex abuse charges
He died a few months later after suffering from lung cancer
(CNN) -- On the anniversary of the death of Joe Paterno, a few dozen people visited a mural depicting the image of the college football coaching legend whose legacy was tarnished by the Jerry Sandusky child molestation scandal.
With the temperature in single digits, about 40 fans in State College, Pennsylvania, stopped by the mural that depicts Paterno and other prominent figures in Penn State University history, according to video shot by CNN affiliate WHP.
Paterno died January 22, 2012, at age 85 in a State College hospital, according to his family. He had been suffering from lung cancer and a broken pelvis.
He had been the all-time leader in major college football victories for a coach, with 409 wins. But a decision by the governing body of major college sports struck 111 victories from his record, beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumped him from the top of the list.
Berman to Corbett: Football came first
Last July, the NCAA levied unprecedented sanctions against the university, including a fine of $60 million and stripped 14 seasons of wins by Paterno's teams.
Paterno, who coached at Penn State for 46 years, was fired after authorities arrested Sandusky, a Penn State defensive coordinator who retired in 1999 and founded a charity for young people.
In 2002, a graduate assistant brought to Paterno allegations of Sandusky's sexual abuse in one of Penn State's facilities. Paterno informed his supervisors of the report, but the school's board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011, saying he could no longer perform his duties in the shadow of scandal.
In an interview with the Washington Post published a week before he died, Paterno said that he felt inadequate to deal with the allegations.
"I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was," the Post quoted him as saying. "So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."
Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.
The mural has been altered in light of the scandal. The artist painted over an image of Sandusky and also removed a halo above Paterno's head.

Will Carnival keep its customers?
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Katia Hetter, CNN
updated 8:17 AM EDT, Mon March 18, 2013
Photographer Jebb Graff had a great time on a seven-day cruise on the Carnival Fantasy last year.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some previous Carnival passengers say they would cruise with the company again
Travel agents and passengers say Carnival Cruise Lines needs to examine maintenance issues
Overall bookings across parent company Carnival Corp. are behind 2012 bookings
(CNN) -- Jebb Graff isn't turned off -- yet -- by Carnival Cruise Lines' recent troubles.
Graff took a seven-day cruise last fall on the Carnival Fantasy to Grand Turk, Half Moon Cay and Nassau, Bahamas and had a wonderful time. "It was a fantastic trip," wrote Graff, a photographer in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, in an email.
"A few veteran cruisers grumbled about the age of the ship, and the decor being dated, but the service and experience was really great," he said.
Graff said he would definitely take another Carnival cruise. But he has some conditions.
Carnival's 'Dream' derailed
Carnival hits more choppy waters
"There's no question that Carnival should be seriously looking into their maintenance policies and double-checking their work to make sure their customers and crews are having the safest voyages possible," wrote Graff. "If these issues continue to go on unchecked, then I'll change my answer."
Carnival cruise line in more troubled waters
Carnival has a window of opportunity to convince customers its ships can sail without too much trouble, according to several travel agents and cruisers interviewed by CNN.com. But the company has to prove it is tackling the recent spate of mechanical issues faced by four Carnival ships, the most serious of which left more than 4,000 people stranded for days aboard the Carnival Triumph last month.
'A grace period' to fix things
Carnival has a grace period of a couple months to get its act together, according to travel agent Ricci Zukerman. Her mostly high-end clients occasionally book a more budget-oriented Carnival cruise for a family reunion or when they're bringing teenagers along because "they're the fun ships," she said.
"Carnival has been in business for many years, and for a long time there's never been a hitch," said Zukerman, president of Worldview Travel. But they need to attend to their maintenance issues. "If it happens again, I think people will start worrying. There are other ships in the ocean," although none quite so affordable, she said.
Carnival Cruise Lines announced a "comprehensive review" this week of all its ships, prompted by the engine fire that led to the Triumph's stranding in the Gulf of Mexico in February.
As the biggest cruise company in the world, parent company Carnival Corp. has a strong reputation in the industry and among its regular customers, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel.
In addition to Carnival Cruise Lines, the corporation's portfolio includes brands such as Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, Cunard and Costa Cruises. The Costa Concordia had a deadly accident off the coast of Italy last year.
Five things we've learned about cruising
Overall advance bookings are down
Total advance bookings across all of Carnival Corp.'s brands for 2013 are behind 2012 levels, Carnival said in a news release Friday announcing first quarter financial results. But despite the overall lag, booking volume since January for the rest of the year has been "running significantly higher than last year at slightly higher prices," the company said.
"Despite considerable attention surrounding the Carnival Triumph, we had been encouraged to see booking volumes for Carnival Cruise Lines recover significantly in recent weeks," said Micky Arison, chief executive officer of Carnival Corp.
"All ships experience some challenges," said Wetty, who traditionally books her customers on high-end cruises. "It's all the recovery and how they treat the passengers and how they continue to build consumer confidence.
"For those who are consistent cruisers and know Carnival, I don't think it's going to change their buying habits. For new cruisers, it puts a little doubt in their minds. "
Not every frequent Carnival cruiser is feeling so confident.
"I have cruised with Carnival on many occasions with my family. They were my [favorite] cruise line. That being said, I will stay on land from here on out," wrote one CNN.com commenter.
"Until they have a really really long period of time with no problems I will not consider cruising with them again. This is just way too much. The Concordia going down was bad enough, but all of these are just plain nonsense. It WILL hurt the cruise line."
Customers need to be reassured Carnival is doing everything it can to address its ships' issues, Wetty said.
How Carnival can clean up the PR mess
Customers of canceled cruises complain
Current customers, some of whom have been posting on CNN.com, are having trouble reaching the company in some cases.
"What about those of us that got our cruise canceled?" wrote one commenter, who said she was scheduled to sail on the Carnival Dream. "I haven't heard anything from Carnival, and I don't know how long it will take to get a refund. Now we are stuck not knowing what to do for a vacation we saved 8 years to take!"
Still, Connie Hammond is one of those Carnival fans who isn't giving up on the cruise line.
"All three of my prior Carnival cruises were wonderful, food was outstanding, ports were well organized and safe, shipboard activities were plentiful, all for a small budget price," Hammond, a resident of Fort Madison, Iowa, wrote in an e-mail.
"I'm sure I could have paid $1,000 more per person and been impressed much more, but the Carnival cruise was a great vacation and a memorable fun time."
Hammond said she expects the recent incidents will be a wake-up call for Carnival's maintenance program, but she's not concerned about safety.
She's already booked her next Carnival cruise, taking her 79-year-old mother and a girlfriend who has never been on a cruise.
After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court?

Former mobster: In 'Whitey' Bulger's gang, death was way of life - CNN.com

Former mobster: In 'Whitey' Bulger's gang, death was way of life
By Deborah Feyerick and Kristina Sgueglia, CNN
updated 10:36 PM EDT, Tue June 18, 2013
James "Whitey" Bulger rose to the top of the notorious Winter Hill gang, prosecutors say, before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after a crooked FBI agent told him in December 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. He was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city. On August 12, the gangster was found guilty on 31 of 32 counts -- including involvement in 11 murders. Here are some other gangsters from America's past.
Al Capone, or "Scarface" as he was popularly known, remains one of America's most notorious gangsters. Known for wearing custom suits, fedoras and spats, Capone was infamous in 1920s Chicago for his bootlegging and racketeering activities. Capone died in 1947. New York Mafia chief John Gotti was known as "Dapper Don" for his expensive suits and "Teflon Don" due to government charges failing to stick in three trials. He was later convicted of murder and racketeering. He died of cancer at age 61 in 2002 while serving a life sentence. Henry Hill, a mobster-turned-informant for the FBI died in 2012 at age 69. His story was the basis for Martin Scorsese's acclaimed 1990 film, "Goodfellas." Ray Liotta played Hill in the film. George "Bugs" Moran was Al Capone's main rival in the Chicago mafia, culminating in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929 in which several members of Moran's gang were killed. Moran died in 1957.
Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker robbed banks across America before meeting their end when police and federal agents ambushed them on a dirt road in Louisiana in 1934. John Dillinger, gangster and bank robber, was the first criminal to be called Public Enemy No. 1 by the FBI. Bureau agents gunned him down outside a movie theater in 1934. George "Baby Face" Nelson, a car thief by age 14, associated with the likes of Al Capone and John Dillinger. Nelson died following a shootout with the FBI in 1934.
Mobster Louis Lepke Buchalter was one of the forces behind a hit squad known as Murder Inc. He died in the electric chair at New York's Sing Sing prison in 1944.
Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll was infamous for the attempted kidnapping of a rival gang member in 1931. Coll shot into a crowd, killing a child and injuring several other youths. Coll escaped conviction due to a lack of credible witnesses. He was later shot to death in 1932 while talking in a phone booth, most likely by a rival gangster.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
72-year-old John Martorano is the government's star witness against Bulger
Martorano has admitted to 20 murders as part of Boston's Winter Hill Gang
He testifies that Bulger was directly involved in some killings
"A serial killer kills because they like it ... I never had any joy in it," Martorano says
Boston (CNN) -- With words as ammunition, a defense lawyer fired a machine gun burst of questions at the government's star witness Tuesday in the federal murder trial of reputed Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger.
"You killed friends?" Bulger attorney Hank Brennan shot.
"Yes," replied prosecution witness John Martorano.
"Families?"
"Yes."
What gangster hopes to get out of trial
Witness describes hits with Bulger
Ex-mobster: Bulger an all-out 'rat'
"Strangers?"
"Yes."
"Innocent people?"
"Yes," said Martorano, who has admitted to 20 murders and who earlier served 12 years in prison on a government deal for his cooperation in the case against Bulger.
Martorano acknowledged he didn't like the term "hitman" since he "wouldn't accept money" for the killings he committed. And he countered the prosecution's descriptions of him as a "mass murderer" and a "serial killer."
"A serial killer kills because they like it. I didn't like it. I never had any joy in it," said Martorano, now 72.
Prosecutors say Martorano killed at the direction of Boston's Winter Hill Gang and Bulger, who is standing trial on 19 murder charges along with racketeering and extortion charges. Bulger was caught in 2011 after spending 16 years as a fugitive and landing on the FBI's most wanted list.
Witness: Heartbroken to know Bulger was FBI informant
"My father, the priests, the nuns" taught him to always "defend family and friends," Martorano testified. When Brenann asked whether there was "any honor or integrity in what you did," Martorano replied, "I thought so."
Under questioning by prosecutors, Martorano explained that the six partners who comprised the Winter Hill Gang -- including Bulger, Steven Flemmi, and Martorano -- had to agree on business decisions and targeted hits. Flemmi is serving life terms without parole but avoided a possible death sentence by cooperating with federal authorities.
"Was it a democracy?" prosecutor Fred Wyshak asked, referring to the Winter Hill Gang. "So to speak," answered Martorano.
The former mobster described Bulger's role in six more murders Tuesday, implicating him in a total of 13 killings in just two days of testimony.
In one case, Martorano claimed that Bulger fired the fatal shot that killed one of the gang's targets, a Dorchester, Massachusetts, bartender who was "squealing" about a murder he had helped the crew commit.
That testimony marked the first time that Bulger was placed on the firing end of a gun in a killing.
In another slaying, Bulger sat at the wheel of a car, while another crime associate, Tommy King, sat in the passenger seat, with Martorano behind him, the witness said.

All had guns but "Tommy's had blanks." When the car pulled out "I shot him in the back of the head," Martorano testified.
"I was driving over Neponset bridge (in Boston) one day and Whitey said tip your hat to Tommy .... He's over there," Martorano testified, acknowledging that he knew where King's body had been dumped.
Martorano said that Bulger's "plan B" to take the heat off the Winter Hill Gang for King's murder was to kill King's good friend, Buddy Leonard, and put him in King's car to make it look like the two got into a dispute that ended with Leonard's death and King's disappearance. Leonard subsequently was found shot to death.
Another time, Bulger sat at a table with another crime associate the partners had decided to kill. As planned, Bulger was counting money with the man when Martorano walked in and shot the man in the temple.
In 1982, Martorano testified, he felt "really bad" about it but carried out a killing anyway. Outnumbered in the decision by his partners, he killed his friend John Callahan.
That came about after another killing: Callahan wanted to buy a business from Oklahoma businessman Roger Wheeler. When Wheeler wouldn't sell, Callahan asked Martorano to kill him.
Martorano said he flew to Oklahoma, picked up a suitcase with machine guns, revolvers and masks that had been shipped from Boston via Greyhound bus, and shot Wheeler between the eyes. Callahan was so grateful he paid his friend $50,000.

But when trusted FBI contact John Connolly indicated that Callahan was going to be pressured by the government to testify about the murder, the Winter Hill partners, with Martorano outvoted, decided it was too risky for Callahan to live.
"I felt lousy but these were my partners. We were up to our necks in murders already," Martorano testified.
He said he arranged to meet Callahan in Florida, picking him up at the airport and helping him with his bags. Then as Callahan got into the front seat, Martorano got in behind and shot his friend in the head.
"I felt really bad. I'd just killed a man I'd risked my life for in Oklahoma," he testified.
Asked by the prosecutor whether he regretted his life of crime, Martorano responded, "Who wouldn't?"
During Martorano's testimony, Bulger sat ramrod straight and kept his eyes focused ahead, barely moving. Bulger turned his head, seeming to look at his former friend sitting just six feet away, only when Martorano said he learned Bulger was an FBI informant.

Death toll rises on Dakar Rally as motorbike competitor killed
updated 3:21 PM EST, Fri January 10, 2014
Belgium's Eric Palante at the start of the 2014 Dakar Rally in Rosario in Argentina. The Honda rider died on the fifth stage of the event.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Motorbike competitor on Dakar Rally found dead
Eric Palante, 50, from Belgium competing in event for 11th time
Went missing on Thursday's fifth stage
Two local media personnel also died on same stage
(CNN) -- The Dakar Rally claimed another victim Friday, as organizers announced the death of an experienced competitor in the motorbikes section.
The body of 50-year-old Belgian Eric Palante was found at the 143km mark of the previous day's stage from Chilecito to San Miguel de Tucuman, the longest of the grueling race.
A support truck had gone in search of the rider, who had been missing overnight after the 911km marathon leg.

Two members of a local Argentine news team also died while following Thursday's fifth stage when their car plunged into a ravine.
Organizers of the annual event said Palante's death would be examined by a judge in the Catamarca Province of Argentina, but reported on their official website that "no alert" had been received ahead of his fatal accident.

They paid tribute to the Honda rider, who was bidding for victory in the amateur motorbikes section: "He knew the race very well, and over the years his enthusiastic but serious approach had made him one of the pillars of the event.
"It is with great sadness that the organizers and the entire family of the Dakar offer their condolences to Eric's family and friends."

Palante is the 27th competitor to die in the rally since it was first staged in 1978, while more than 50 have died overall, including spectators, support crew and the media.
The marathon motor rally, for cars, motorbikes and trucks, was originally staged between Paris and Dakar in Senegal.
It was moved to South America, principally Argentina and Chile, in 2009 because of threats of terrorism.

Can Bill Cosby make TV history again?
By David Bianculli
updated 5:31 PM EST, Thu January 23, 2014
Comedian Bill Cosby, who played Cliff Huxtable in the 1980s sitcom "The Cosby Show," launched a poll on his website asking fans to vote for their favorite "Cosby Show" sweater. The sports bracket-styled poll features selections in categories including "The Crew," "The Sweat," and "The Fleecy," narrowed down for the top spot of "The Champion Stitch." Click through the gallery for more iconic looks.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Bianculli: Bill Cosby made TV history with starring roles in "I Spy," "The Cosby Show"
He says there's news he'll be, at 76, in a new TV show. Can lightning strike thrice?
He says despite Cosby's two ground-breaking shows, he's had quite a few that have failed
Bianculli: He can score again, but only if NBC lets him swing for fences. He's still hilarious
Editor's note: David Bianculli is founder and editor of TV Worth Watching.com and teaches TV and film at Rowan University in New Jersey. He also is TV critic and guest host for NPR's "Fresh Air with Terry Gross."
(CNN) -- In 1965 Bill Cosby made TV history and changed the face of television. He co-starred in NBC's "I Spy," becoming the first African-American male to star in a prime-time network drama -- and won three Emmys doing it.
In 1984, two decades later, Cosby made another pioneering TV achievement, reviving the then-dormant sitcom form by starring as the patriarch of a loving family called the Huxtables. The Cosby Show soon was TV's No. 1 show, and helped make NBC television's No. 1 network -- all while blasting another programming myth: That white viewers wouldn't embrace an all-black TV show.
David Bianculli
Now, 30 years after doctor and dad Cliff Huxtable, and almost 50 years after tennis trainer and secret agent Alexander Scott, NBC is returning to the Bill Cosby well one more time -- and hoping his stardom, fan base and legacy can bring some much-needed magic to broadcast television in the 21st century.
The Deadline Hollywood website has reported that NBC and Cosby, partnered with producer Tom Werner (part owner of the company that produced "The Cosby Show"), have reached an agreement to produce a family sitcom starring Cosby.
The question is, can lightning strike thrice? Can Cosby make TV history yet again? And is it even fair to expect or ask him to?
Remember, first of all, that not every Bill Cosby TV series has been a guaranteed hit. After "I Spy," Cosby scored big in the children's television arena, with the animated "Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids" and his playful appearances on "The Electric Company" and "Sesame Street." But his prime-time series didn't always score as successes.
His first NBC series after "I Spy," the 1969 sitcom "The Bill Cosby Show," showcased him as a high-school coach and phys ed teacher. It was a very smart series, and positioned Cosby's Chet Kincaid in a strong position of authority, but it didn't catch on.
His next series -- for CBS this time -- came in 1972: a weekly variety series called "The New Bill Cosby Show." Its key ingredients, in addition to Cosby's weekly comic monologues, included dancer-actress Lola Falana, pretend drunk Foster Brooks, and bandleader Quincy Jones. But this show, in an era when variety shows were as ubiquitous as reality shows are today, was gone after one season.

Cosby: Parents wait for you to move out
1976's "Cos," for ABC, was a variety show aimed at youngsters. It lasted two months. Then came "The Cosby Show," eight seasons of which singlehandedly moved TV from the topical and raw comedy of Norman Lear's sitcoms to an era in which television parents regained control, and family civility returned.
After "The Cosby Show" were more Cosby series, ones that never captured the same zeitgeist: NBC's "The Cosby Mysteries" (1994-95), and CBS's "Cosby" sitcom (1996-2000, re-teaming him with "Cosby Show" TV spouse Phylicia Rashad), and an "Art Linkletter's House Party" sequel of sorts: CBS's "Kids Say the Darndest Things" (1998-2000), with Cosby interviewing children.
In other words, over his TV career, Bill Cosby has hit as many singles and doubles as home runs. At 76, does Cosby have another long-ball miracle in him?
My bet is that he can, indeed, do it again -- provided he swings for the fences, and that NBC does nothing to impede Cosby from following his instincts and doing precisely what he wants.
The major warning flag, on NBC right now, is "The Michael J. Fox Show," which has returned another '80s NBC sitcom icon to television -- but not successfully, because the network seemed to think that merely signing Fox and bringing him back was enough. It isn't. You need the right role, the right writers and the right cast, and you have to put them all together at the right time.
But Cosby, like a comedy locust, seems amazingly designed to surface every two or three decades and capture the imagination. In the right vehicle, he can do it again.
His timing and his jokes were on full, hilarious display in last year's Comedy Central standup special, whose title may prove prophetic: "Bill Cosby: Far from Finished." Can his humor still work today, when, as always, he avoids going "blue"? It certainly worked on Comedy Central. Blue, black -- Bill Cosby never has made color more of a priority than universality.
If I were given a vote in designing Cosby's 21st-century sitcom comeback vehicle, I'd craft it as a dual home life/workplace vehicle, like the classic "The Dick Van Dyke Show." At home, let Cosby be the family grandpa, holding court over a loving, lively, extended family.
But let him to go work beyond retirement age, too, as a tenured college professor or a veteran media pundit on a TV talk show. Either way, he'd get to vent about current events, forgotten history and anything else the real William H. Cosby Ph.D. would care to bring to the viewing public via prime-time TV.
Including, of course, his observations on family and other parts of his still-funny monologues. More than 50 years after he released his first comedy album, Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow. Right?
Riiiiiight...
