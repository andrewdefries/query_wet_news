Remember to include your name and the city/country where you live.Lebanon Beirut Hello, I'm originally Lebanese (but currently live in Chicago)... I was just back in Beirut this past summer and really enjoyed a club called "Element" (at one point during the evening they bring down a huge screen and play a couple songs from a concert: which makes everyone in the club go wild as if they were part of the audience).My friends and I also enjoyed spending time at the beach: in southern Lebanon there is a beach called Guava where you can rent out a bungalow for the night and invite your friends over for a party around the outdoor hot tub... or you can just waste away on the sand and enjoy the sound of the waves hitting the beach.And for good food: downtown Beirut (see picture)... they have a wide variety of little cafes and restaurants: from traditional Lebanese style (hookah included!) to Asian, Italian, or French. By far, some of the finest meals I have eaten were in the city of Beirut. Lama; ChicagoBeirut is certainly a unique city, not only in the Middle East, but in the whole world. What's special about this city is that it can neither be labelled as typically eastern nor can it be characterized as western! Wherever you go in this town you will be faced with contradictions: High-rise next to low-rise residential blocks, modern office buildings next to old traditional houses, Roman ruins next to fashionable boutiques, exclusive restaurants and bars next to wartorn buildings. But amazingly, all this mad world of contradictions and juxtapositions somehow ends at the feet of the Mediterranean Sea...at the city's Corniche, where many people go jogging in the morning or for a stroll in the evening, everyone is equal, no matter what background, social status or religion one has! So be sure to stop by Beirut during your "The Scene" tour!! Mohamad Ali; GermanyHey, just wanted to tell you guys that you have to stop by in Beirut during your "The Scene" series. It is by far the throbbing party capital of the Middle East, with buzzing clubs, classy restaurants, and bustling bars. Lebanese are born with "partying" in their blood, we are sociable, friendly, and simply love to live. What makes Lebanon and Beirut in particular so special is that tourists, unlike other tourist destinations, are not the only essential ones in giving the city its buzz, it is the local crowd that gives the nightlife its edge. This summer, we have attracted the best DJs in the world to come show us what they've got -- Paul Van Dyk (#2 DJ) was here in July, Ferry Corsten (# 5 DJ) was here in August, we just had Tiesto (#1 DJ) here, who mixed his beats to a massive 15-18,000 strong crowd for four hours, and we are expecting Armin Van Buuren (# 3 DJ) here in November. There is no high and low season in Beirut, the party never dies. In the day cool off by the beaches or go skiing depending on the season in the evening dine in dazzling Downtown and later party like crazy among the mixture of bars and clubs in Monot Street. In Beirut you'll find variety, class, wildness, and unlimited fun all rolled into one. Ziad Ghusayni Story Tools

A nation's eating habits
By David E. Williams CNNAdjust font size:
(CNN) -- For Americans, rushing to get dinner on the table between work, soccer, ballet class and bedtime, time is often the missing ingredient, and it leads many people to rely on take-out, fast food and easy-to-fix convenience foods, diet experts say.But most Americans still eat at home, according to Harry Balzer, a vice president at the The NPD Group. The marketing information group has been studying our eating habits since 1980."We've always eaten in the home," Balzer said. "In fact, the trend has been toward eating more meals in home, always. It's just [that we've] been getting more and more of those meals at a restaurant to eat at your house."And, he said, that's changed over the past three or four years. Frozen and pre-prepared foods have gotten more popular, and people are not ordering out as much."You want to eat in your house, you don't want to really go out. But you don't want to prepare the meal, or you want to spend as little time preparing the meal," Balzer said. "So one of the ways to do that is to just prepare fewer dishes, and that's the driving force in the way we're eating right now."He said that about half of all main dishes are still put together with fresh ingredients or from scratch. "But that number's been declining for 10 years, and that doesn't show any sign of slowing down because assembling a meal takes time and effort."Lola O'Rourke, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, said that grocery stores are offering more foods that are both good for you and easy to fix."I think that there are very healthful options available," she said. "If you look in the produce department, there are pre-prepped vegetables that are ready for stir-fry or whatever."One characteristic of produce that some people view as making it difficult to consume is that it requires a little bit of preparation, usually," O'Rourke said, "and I think that there are options out there that can help people."Portions, pants-sizes increasingBalzer also said he keeps track of his respondents' body mass index -- and that number has been rising steadily. (BMI measures weight in relation to height.)"The numbers of meals we eat over these last 20 years really has not changed significantly, but the weight people reported to me has," Balzer said. "So, by inference, I have to conclude that the average meal is getting larger."Barbara Rolls, a professor of biobehavioral health at Penn State University, said that portions served in the home and typical recipes in cookbooks are all bigger now than in the '70s. (Quiz: Pick the correct portion)Rolls has studied the effects of portion size and found that "if you give people more food they eat more." She said that people she studied often did not notice the bigger meals, even when researchers doubled the portion size."And they're sitting in a cubicle in a lab by themselves, so imagine when you're distracted, eating out, you've got some wine or beer, you're conversing," Rolls said. "People don't pay attention."She said restaurants also are offering bigger portions in a continually escalating battle to attract customers."We love value, but in the end, if you're going to get to be obese it's a pretty poor value, because you're going to end up with more health-care costs, you're going to earn less money," Rolls said. "There are all kinds of economic consequences of not keeping your weight in a healthy range."Rolls said that cutting the calorie density of a meal, by substituting low-calorie cheese or mayonnaise for example, can have an even greater impact on the diet than cutting portion size."Just as a small rise in extra calories sneaks in unnoticed, you could probably reduce calories by a small amount and people wouldn't notice," Rolls said.Don't eat so fastEating on the run and not lingering over a daily family dinner are also changes from the past."I think it's really important for people to slow down when they eat, even if they don't have a lot of time," O'Rourke said. "Slow down, and that will help them eat less."She said that it normally takes about 20 minutes for the brain to get the message that the stomach is full."People are so pressed for time, and that's often something they'll state as a reason for eating fast food or eating sort of whatever is at hand even if it's not the most healthful thing," O'Rourke said. "But it's sort of ironic that at the same time, people are consuming more food which, theoretically, should take longer to eat."O'Rourke said another advantage of slowing down is that you appreciate what you're eating, "instead of just mindlessly inhaling too much food."

Blind women help detect breast cancerStory Highlights Blind women being trained to use their sensitive touch to detect breast cancer lumps Called Medical Tactile Examiners, they can spend more time on patients The 'Discovering Hands' program takes place at a school in Düren, west GermanyNext Article in Health » By Nick Wade and Joana Krause-Palfner For CNN LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blind women are being trained to use their sensitive touch to help detect breast cancer earlier and more precisely than doctors. The blind assistants use tape strips with braille coordinates to accurately locate cancerous lumps The program, called "Discovering Hands," is the brainchild of German gynecologist Dr. Frank Hoffmann. Two years ago, he created Braille strips as a system of orientation, allowing the blind to carry out breast examinations. Using these strips blind women are trained to become Medical Tactile Examiners (MTUs) because they are more able to detect smaller lumps than sighted doctors. Hoffman argues that because of their disability, the blind can possess a more acutely developed sense of touch, which has proved to be a valuable asset in breast examinations. Once the strips are placed along specific areas of the breast, they are then used to report a precise location to the doctor as the MTU reads their Braille coordinates. "We are turning a disability into a gift," Dr. Hoffmann told CNN. "It's like the game Battleship," he added. "You have the exact location." A study at the Essen University's women's clinic, Germany, concluded that MTUs found more and smaller tumors than doctors in 450 cases. The identification of smaller lumps allows earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment. Another advantage of having MTUs is that they are able to dedicate more time to examining a patient. Dr. Hoffman said he had previously been able to spend only a few minutes on each examination due to his other commitments, whereas MTUs can commit half an hour. Training takes place at the BFW occupational school in Düren, west Germany, a center for those who are no longer able to continue their profession because of visual impairment or blindness. So far, ten blind women have qualified as MTUs. One of the women, Marie-Luise Voll, 57, told CNN: " The work brings me a lot of joy." Don't Miss Battling breast cancer
Voll had previously practiced as a nurse before losing her sight in 2007, but used the experience when training at Düren for her new role. The highly personal nature of the procedure means that only women will be trained. The MTUs report to the doctor - for whom they act as an assistant not a replacement - who then uses this information as part of their ultimate diagnosis. If an abnormality is located the doctor will decide how to proceed, with ultrasounds and mammography being the most frequent course of action. The testing phase of the project between 2006 and 2008 has now been completed in Germany. The hope is that twenty trained MTUs will qualify every year after 2010. The program has been acclaimed as a success by both patients and practitioners in Germany. Health services in Europe including Ireland, France, Denmark and Austria have also registered interest in starting an equivalent of their own, Hoffman said. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Pitcher lands himself a new home -- at an assisted living centerStory Highlights Because of little pay in independent league, players stay with host families Pitcher Josh Faiola staying at Belvedere of Westlake facility near Cleveland, Ohio Faiola says teammates joked first, but he's thrilled to bring energy to residents Residents decorated facility, will be watching pitcher's every throw Next Article in U.S. » By Mallory Simon CNN (CNN) -- When pitcher Josh Faiola walks out of the dugout on opening day with the Lake Erie Crushers, he'll already have a large group of fans in the stands -- his new roommates at the Belvedere of Westlake assisted living facility. Pitcher Josh Failoa stands as residents and friends of The Belvedere of Westlake welcome him Tuesday. The 25-year-old, who was drafted in 2006 by the Baltimore Orioles and is trying to work his way to the majors, admits he was caught a little off guard when he was told about his new housing situation. "At first I was like, 'OK, that's a little different,' " he said. "I was taken aback at first." And he was also the butt of a couple jokes from his teammates. "They were saying things like 'So what's the deal? Do you have to go to bed early?' " Faiola said. But then he told them about his room -- a large suite, with his own kitchenette, washer and dryer, furniture and a TV. "Then they changed their tune," he said. "They were like 'That's awesome. Are they any other vacancies?' " Like many of the players in the independent Frontier League who don't rake in the big bucks, Faiola is living with a host family. But his host family is a little different. Most of the players live with families with younger children. But in his case, Faiola is the young one -- about 55 years younger than the rest of his "roommates." Eighty-four-year-old Meda Dennis, who has been living in the center for four years, said Faiola's arrival is the most exciting thing to happen since a good Elvis impersonator showed up. "It's been quite exciting because he's young and new and interesting and we're old," she joked. Faiola made his way to the assisted living center in Westlake, Ohio, near Cleveland, with the help of Cindy Griffiths-Novak. She heard the new local baseball team was looking for host families for the players. But because she has a 3- and 4-year-old at home, she turned to her family's assisted living center as an option for Faiola. Griffiths-Novak went to the residents with the idea and they unanimously voted for Faiola to live there. But his new housing situation is about more than just a place to crash after the game. "It certainly is great for the residents because now we get a lot of energy and youth and excitement," Griffiths-Novak said. It has turned into an exciting time for the residents, who jumped at the chance to decorate the entire facility before the pitcher's arrival. "You should see the decorations," Griffiths-Novak said. "The residents all signed motivational good luck pennants for him, there's a 40-foot banner, we have a whole thing dedicated to Josh. I'm sure he is so embarrassed with all of the baseball cards with their face on it." They've made signs telling him he's in a league of his own, but they've also set their expectations high for him. "Some of the pendants say things like 'Don't get cut, move your butt,' " Griffiths-Novak said. "He's certainly going to be under the microscope! We'll be watching and keeping track of all of his stats." Faiola was awestruck when he walked in and saw all of the decorations. The activity director has been doing craft activities with the residents -- making visors with baseball logos and Crushers necklaces in anticipation of the game. Dennis is looking forward to watching their new ace pitcher hit the mound even though she hasn't seen a baseball game live in a while. "Anything's better than the Indians right now," Dennis joked. "We'll definitely be cheering for him, though, and if he happens to have a bad game, he'll have a lot of shoulders to cry on. But I don't think he'll need them." Norma J. Lane, 85, said even though she's more of a football fan, she's looking forward to following Faiola and baseball more closely. "We are just wishing him well because it's such a great experience for all of us," Lane said. "We're looking forward to having him around." Faiola said he is excited to help bring some fun to the residents, some of whom are already considering him to be like a grandson. "I always loved spending time with my grandparents and one of my great-grandparents was in an assisted living home and I remember how excited she was to see us when we went to visit her," he said. "And they are being so nice to open up this place to me, so hopefully I can bring a little bit of joy." Faiola, who had surgery two years ago and was dropped from the Orioles during spring training, is hoping his stint with the Crushers can help get him picked up by a Major League team. Regardless of what happens, he knows he has the support of his new roommates. "They've all really come out and supported me, they even bring me food and give me snacks," he said. "I couldn't ask for anything better. And with all of them watching so closely, I'll have to keep my game up. They've definitely set a high bar for me."

Why the Devil doesn't buy Prada onlineBy Barry Neild, for CNN | Filed under: Web Models parade during the Marc Jacobs show at New York fashion week. STORY HIGHLIGHTSMarc Jacobs this week become newest fashion house to embrace e-commerceLuxury labels reluctance to retail online seen as attempt to protect exclusivityIndependent retailers have generated millions selling big name brands (CNN) -- The Devil might wear Prada, but until recently he would have had a devil of a time buying it direct from the fashion company's website. Prada, like many leading purveyors of designer clothing and luxury goods, until two months ago had avoided selling its products direct via the Internet. Even now it just sells accessories, not clothes. The Italian fashion house isn't alone. Marc Jacobs, the American label owned by French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is only this week taking its first tentative steps into online retailing. Prior to the re-launch of the Marc Jacobs website, the company's online presence was used only to sell the brand's exclusivity, with images of glitzy gear but no electronic shopping basket in which to bundle it. They have had to accept that they can't rely on the same tiny slice of customers that they used to--Kerry Potter, Elle magazine

Other labels, such as shoe designer Jimmy Choo and German fashion house Hugo Boss, are selling direct online, but it's a recent trend. So why is that, while they may lead the world when it comes to couture, many of the world's top designers are unfashionably late when it comes to e-commerce? "Whether or not to sell online -- it's been a big debate for many years now," luxury goods analyst Marshall Cooper, CEO of LuxuryBrandNetwork.com told CNN. "Luxury brands obtain premium prices by creating an aura around their products. On the web, it's much harder to create this aura." Kerry Potter, contributing editor to glossy monthly fashion magazine Elle, says there has been suspicion of the internet among many established fashion houses largely due to a fear of image erosion. "They've all been very slow to get with the program," she said, adding that a number of issues were now forcing many to change their opinion of the web. Not least is the stellar success of independent retailers such as Net-a-porter.com, a website that learned from the mistakes of earlier failed online designer retail ventures to corner a huge slice of the market. Net-a-porter, which offers clothing and accessories from more than 300 big name luxury brands, was launched in a backroom in London by former magazine editor Natalie Massenet in 2000. Massenet says she spotted a gap in the market in which fashion magazines were telling consumers what -- but not where -- to buy. "So by creating a site that does both, we think the place where the time-starved consumer gets her fashion news will also be the place where she chooses to shop," she told Fortune magazine. Business boomed. In the year to January 2010, the site pulled in a reported $187 million. Three months later, Massenet sold her stake to Swiss luxury goods group Richemont for an estimated $78 million. With the global economic downturn snapping at the hemlines of even the most exclusive designers, such online revenue figures have been a wake- up call. "It's a lost opportunity more than anything," says LuxuryBrandNetwork's Cooper. "The web has become such a force in people's lives -- especially for people under 40, there is now a recognition that it cannot be ignored." According to Potter, the shift towards online retailing is a recognition by the once dictatorial fashion industry that it is facing a "democratization," partly driven by the Internet. She said moves by designers such as Burberry to broadcast catwalk shows on their websites, thus granting access to even the most casual fashionistas, was a tacit acknowledgement of this. "They have had to accept that they can't rely on the same tiny slice of customers that they used to." Added Potter, another factor is the global spread of demand, often to places where there is no access to boutiques catering to the style- conscious wealthy. But she says, not all the impetus for change is external. Louis Vuitton -- one of the most world's most counterfeited fashion labels -- is putting the squeeze on fakes by e-selling direct, while at other labels, younger web-savvy designers are actively pushing moves online. "A lot of fashion houses are being run by old designers who do not understand the internet. But if you look at newer, emerging labels and designers -- some are being run by women in their 30s who understand that women do not necessarily have time to spend several hours in stores looking at dresses." So must designer labels resign themselves to losing their mystique by retailing online? Not necessarily, according to Cooper. "I think they can protect their brand if their web presence complements their offline strategy." Whether they can or not, it seems with Marc Jacobs now resolutely on board, e-commerce is now as inescapable a trend for the fashion industry as aviator jackets this season. Said Potter: "What Marc Jacobs does, everyone follows."

Femi Kuti builds on his father's musical legacy From Isha Sesay, CNN Femi Kuti: Beyond the LegacySTORY HIGHLIGHTSFemi Kuti has been making music for 26 years Like his father Fela, Femi's music carries a political message In 1985 Femi left his fathers' band and formed "The Positive Force" His new album "Africa for Africa" is his "rawest" record yet (CNN) -- The name Kuti belongs to a musical dynasty. But Femi Kuti is by no means living in his father's shadow and is much more than just the son of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti. For 26 years, Femi has been making his own music. He has crossed over to a global audience, recording with the likes of Mos Def and Macy Gray, and even providing a cameo voice over in video game Grand Theft Auto IV. But his career has not been about ignoring his past, but building on his father's legacy. "I just wanted my own music so I was not really running away from that fact or trying to find my own identity as such," Kuti said. "I just wanted to play good music and be happy playing good music." His father, Nigerian multi-instrumentalist Fela, was an international superstar and is credited with inventing the Afrobeat genre. However, it wasn't just his music that made Fela famous but his views as well. He preached for democracy over dictatorship and his music gave a voice to millions in Nigeria who were powerless in politics. "He was truthful, he stood his ground, he never compromised, even at the risk of his life, and I think that's really what people admire," Kuti explained. "He never for one second thought of compromising or selling out his ideas. "I saw him many times stand in front of the soldiers and say 'shoot me, kill me' and we all feared for his life many times, and I thought 'wow, will I ever be this brave in my life?' So I admired him," he continued. Femi Kuti's inspiration and message
But Fela's son has become a star in his own right. At 48, Femi has already spent a lifetime in music and grew up playing in his father's band. In 1985 he assembled his own band called "The Positive Force" and through it he discovered his own style and his own voice. But he says watching his father stand up for himself gave him the strength to never compromise. "I've witnessed a lot in my life, in his life, and I think all this is part of what gives me the courage myself to stand firm," he said. Like his father's, Femi's voice is political, his cause is human rights. He says that a political message in his music is more important than singing about love. Inside Africa: Maurice Kirya - Ugandan soul music "I couldn't see myself possibly doing anything else -- when I see poverty so blatant in front of me I don't see myself, I don't see the love story that could overwhelm my mind than singing about deprived people or children for instance," he said. "I see that in a country so rich as Nigeria people can't afford a good education, we still have no electricity, the politicians keep giving us all their excuses," he added. "We're 12 years now in a new democratic era and we're still fighting the same story that my father fought when I was 15." In his latest work Femi has not turned his back on his father's Afrobeat style; he's redefined, it adding worldwide influence into the music. He recorded new album "Africa for Africa" in the same studio where he produced his first recordings with his father. The comparisons with Fela remain and the message is the same as it's always been. I want them to think about what I'm saying -- the importance of Africa, the future of Africa.--Femi Kuti

Music
The recording itself has no superfluous production on it; Femi says he wanted this one to sound raw by making this the least produced album he's ever made. "We thought nobody will like the album and then immediately from Europe everyone was like 'oh this is real raw, oh we love it,'" he said. "We all got excited so that gave me the extra energy to want to play it on stage and continue -- I think there is nothing more terrible than you walk out and nobody likes it. You are so depressed -- it's like being sick and you cannot find what is wrong with you" he continued. But his live shows are always acclaimed. On stage, it's easy to see Femi Kuti's connection to his craft. But after so many years of performing, he says it's the chance to make people smile, feel happy and be inspired that still drives him today. "You might play to 5,000 people and one person might come up and tell you 'wow, thank you for a wonderful night,' and you go to bed and it rings in your head," he explained. He says that most importantly, when people think about his music he doesn't want them to think about him. "I want them to think about what I'm saying -- the importance of Africa, the future of Africa," he said. "I don't want them to think about Femi and Fela Kuti. It's beyond me, it wasn't about my father, it was about the African people -- it was about a greater place to be."

Nearly 30 die in two Afghan attacks
From Masoud Popalzai and Barbara Starr, CNN
updated 11:09 AM EDT, Wed June 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: 17 civilians and a translator were killed in Khost, authorities said
NEW: Three American soldiers were also killed, a Western official said
Women and children were among eight people killed in Logar province
Khost and Logar provinces are in the eastern part of the country
(CNN) -- Bombings in two restive eastern Afghan provinces killed at least 29 people Wednesday, authorities said.
One strike occurred in Khost city when a suicide bomber on a motorcycle targeted NATO and Afghan security forces. The town is in the province of the same name.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul and Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office said 17 Afghan civilians were killed and 32 others were injured. The embassy said three members of the NATO-led International Security Force and an Afghan interpreter died in Khost. A Western official told CNN the soldiers are Americans.
"Such disregard for the lives of civilians and soldiers further demonstrates that the Taliban and other insurgents indiscriminately continue their murderous campaign against all, including women and children," the embassy said.
Karzai's office issued a statement strongly condemning the attack. The embassy also condemned the attack and called it "cowardly."
A U.S. official said authorities believe the suicide bomber may have been wearing an explosive vest, which he detonated at a checkpoint. Amir Padshah Mangal, director of the Khost public health department, said three police officers and a child were among those killed.
In Logar province, four children and two women were among eight killed when a vehicle hit a roadside bomb planted by the Taliban, according to a Twitter message from Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi.

CNN's Masoud Popalzai and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Barbara Starr contributed from Washington.

Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly launch battle against gun lobby: No more 'fear'
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 6:04 PM EST, Tue January 8, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Giffords and Kelly cite overall figure for gun deaths which includes suicides
The two launched a political action committee to raise money to counter the gun lobby A Connecticut lawmaker apologized for telling Giffords to "stay out"
Giffords and Kelly want background checks for private sales of firearms
(CNN) -- Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly have launched what they hope will mark a new era in the battle over gun rights in America.
On the second anniversary of a mass shooting in Arizona that wounded Giffords and killed six others, the couple launched a political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, along with a website calling for contributions to help "encourage elected officials to stand up for solutions to prevent gun violence and protect responsible gun ownership."
In an op-ed in USA Today, the two make their goal clear: to counter the influence of the gun lobby.
"Special interests purporting to represent gun owners but really advancing the interests of an ideological fringe have used big money and influence to cow Congress into submission," they write.

Gabby Giffords rouses convention
"Rather than working to find the balance between our rights and the regulation of a dangerous product, these groups have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties. Rather than conducting a dialogue, they threaten those who divert from their orthodoxy with political extinction."
Emphasizing that they support the Second Amendment and own two guns themselves, Giffords and Kelly call for "laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun violence."
"Until now, the gun lobby's political contributions, advertising and lobbying have dwarfed spending from anti-gun violence groups. No longer. With Americans for Responsible Solutions engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide, legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby."

"America has seen an astounding 11 mass shootings since a madman used a semiautomatic pistol with an extended ammunition clip to shoot me and kill six others," Giffords writes.
"This country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems, big and small ... But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence, we're not even trying -- and for the worst of reasons."
Giffords and Kelly have spoken out in the wake of last month's slaughter in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 27 people murdered, 26 of them at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- including 20 children.
Giffords wrote on Facebook at the time, "As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws -- and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America. This can no longer wait."
Giffords and Kelly visited Newtown last week. They met with local and state leaders to discuss gun control legislation, mental health identification and treatment, and "concerns for the erosion of our societal values such that we are increasingly desensitized to violence," according to Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra.
Giffords told to 'stay out'

That visit also highlighted the intense political concerns surrounding such issues.
Connecticut State Rep. DebraLee Hovey, the state's assistant Republican leader, posted a note on her Facebook page saying, "Gabby Gifford stay out of my towns!"
Hovey later issued a statement apologizing, saying, "Our community has struggled greatly through this tragedy, and we are all very sensitive to the potential for this event to be exploited for political purposes. This is what I wish to avoid." The statement added that Hovey has advocated for a dialogue on mental health issues, school safety and gun control.
Kelly, a former captain in the U.S. Navy and NASA astronaut, also responded publicly in the wake of the Newtown shootings.
On his Facebook page, he took on the National Rifle Association -- the central pro-gun rights lobby -- after a news conference by a top NRA official about the Newtown tragedy triggered widespread anger.
Kelly wrote that the NRA's response was "defiant and delayed," and that the organization "chose narrow partisan concerns over the safety of our families and communities."
The NRA has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected, and that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided.
"If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy," NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said of the anger following his initial news conference.
NRA President David Keene later told CNN the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards.
Kelly: 'Good guys with guns' aren't the whole answer
LaPierre made clear his group believes that more guns, not fewer, are necessary for security.
"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," he said.
Mark Kelly and his wife Gabrielle Giffords are launching a PAC to battle gun lobby.
Kelly said he knows from personal experience that that's not the case.
The day Jared Loughner shot Giffords and 18 other people at a public event in Tucson, there was such a "good guy," Kelly argued in an interview with ABC.
A man came out "of the store next door and nearly shot the man who took down Jared Loughner," Kelly said. "The one who eventually wrestled (Loughner) to the ground was almost killed himself by a good guy with a gun, so I don't really buy that argument."
Giffords and Kelly want to require comprehensive background checks for private sales of firearms, ABC reported. And Kelly said he does not believe an extended magazine is needed for those who have guns for sport.
Gunmen have used high-capacity weapons in numerous shootings, including one at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, where gunman Adam Lanza had four weapons.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, is pushing legislation to reinstate a ban on assault weapons.
A former Marine's passionate disagreement with Feinstein has garnered attention online.
There just may be a time when I need to do the unthinkable.Joshua Boston, former Marine
"I own the guns I own because I acknowledge mankind's shortcomings instead of pretending like they don't exist," Joshua Boston wrote in a CNN iReport. "There are evil men in this world and there just may be a time when I need to do the unthinkable to protect me or my family."
Facebook user Ellen Schmuker wrote in a CNN discussion that Giffords and Kelly's plan is "foolish" because "all gun bans are going to do is punish law abiding citizens for the actions of lunatics."
But HoaiPhuong Nguyen took the opposite stance. "No one is more qualified to head this effort, go Gabby and Mark," she wrote.
What do you think of Gabby Giffords & Mark Kelly's new efforts to counter the gun lobby? Weigh in for a story. ow.ly/gD5M7— Josh Levs (@joshlevscnn) January 8, 2013
CNN.com users weighed in on Twitter as well, with Susan Blumberg-Kason saying she considers the idea "crucial."
'We can't be naive'
In their column Tuesday, Giffords and Kelly note that that gun violence "kills more than 30,000 Americans annually."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2009, 31,347 people died from firearm injuries. Nearly 60% were a result of suicide. Homicide comprised 37% of those deaths. Overall firearm injuries were down 2% from the year before.
Giffords' remarkable recovery after being shot in the head has inspired many across the political spectrum. She told ABC she's doing physical therapy, yoga, and speech therapy, and working with a service dog. She has also been able to begin some outdoor activities.
The tragedy two years ago thrust her and her husband into a new kind of spotlight. Tuesday marks a moment in which they are turning all that focus and attention -- as well as their passionate calls for stricter gun control -- into a political movement.
"We can't be naive about what it will take to achieve the most common-sense solutions," they wrote in their op-ed. "We can't just hope that the last shooting tragedy will prevent the next. Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources."
"We have experienced too much death and hurt to remain idle. Our response to the Newtown massacre must consist of more than regret, sorrow and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve fellow citizens and leaders who have the will to prevent gun violence in the future."

First Miss America of Indian descent embraces discussion on diversity
By Greg Botelho, CNN
updated 7:07 AM EDT, Thu September 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Nina Davuluri, a first generation Indian-American, was crowned Miss America
Some reacted on Twitter by calling her not sufficiently American or a terrorist
She says her win shows how what defines "the girl next door" is evolving
"I am living my American dream," Davuluri says
(CNN) -- Ready or not America, Nina Davuluri is the new girl next door.
That's how the 24-year-old Indian-American woman sees herself, she explained to CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday, three days after being crowned Miss America.
"I have always viewed Miss America as the girl next door," Davuluri said. "But the girl next door is evolving, as the diversity of America evolves. She's not who she was 10 years ago, and she's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road."
The fact that her win Sunday spurred a torrent of racist reactions online -- many along the lines that she doesn't represent what the United States is -- didn't surprise Davuluri. She'd experienced it on a smaller scale when she became the first Miss New York of Indian descent.
Davuluri sees it as her mission to tackle such stereotypes head on. It's why the daughter of two Indian-born parents has a pageant platform of "celebrating diversity through cultural competence."
And the Miss America winner is ...

First Indian-American Miss America
"I wanted to be the first Indian Miss America, to be that symbol of a new face for the organization," she said Wednesday. "And to let younger girls know that regardless of race, their socioeconomic status, their religion that anyone can become not only Miss America, but anything."
Still, it would be understandable if Davuluri was taken aback by tweets claiming she wasn't sufficiently American or was a terrorist. Yet she's been more heartened by all those that rallied around her.
"For one negative tweet, I received dozens of positive tweets and support from not only Indians, but the American people across the country and ... the world for that matter," the Fayetteville, New York, native said. "It's been such an honor."
And while some criticize the pageant circuit for putting looks above all else, Davuluri said she's thankful it helped her earn $25,000 in scholarships to study cognitive science at the University of Michigan. She will have another $60,000 to apply to her medical school tuition -- $50,000 from her Miss America win and $10,000 from Miss New York. This is all part of the more than $45 million in cash and scholarships the pageant organization gives out.
Yes, Davuluri admits, good looks are a part of the equation. Contestants do strut around in swimsuits, after all, and they are judged as they walk in evening gowns. Davuluri says "that's reality," as is the 10-minute interview with judges that people don't see on TV.
And Davuluri couldn't be happier with the reality she's now living -- as a groundbreaker, and a talking point, in a country addressing its cultural diversity.
As she says: "I am living my American dream."
