Accused captor is an unholy hypocrite, Smart says By Ann O'Neill, CNN Elizabeth Smart's 'nine months in hell'STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Elizabeth Smart calls her captor "hypocritical" for claiming a calling from GodShe testified Wednesday in trial of Brian David Mitchell, charged with kidnapping her"He was crude and vulgar, self-serving," she saysMitchell and his wife constantly squabbled over her jealousy and his drinking, she saysEditor's Note: For more trial coverage, see CNN affiliate KSTU. Read about Smart's spiritual journey on CNN's Belief Blog. Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- They were the words Elizabeth Smart waited eight years to say, and when she spoke them from the witness stand Wednesday, they poured out with an intensity that brought jurors to the edge of their seats. Brian David Mitchell was no prophet, she said. He was an unholy hypocrite. There was nothing divine about his mission to steal her in the dark of night and make her his unwilling child bride, she said. "He was crude and vulgar, self-serving," she stated, looking directly at the jury. "He was his number one priority, followed by sex, drugs and alcohol, but he used religion in all those aspects to justify everything." Assistant U.S. Attorney Felice John Viti asked how she could be so certain about Mitchell's character, and Smart held nothing back. Elizabeth Smart testifies

"Well, nine months of living with him and seeing him proclaim that he was God's servant and he had been called to do God's work, and everything that he did to me and to my family is something I know God would never tell someone to do," she said. ''God would never tell someone to kidnap a young girl from her family's home in the middle of the night, from her bed that she shared with her sister, from her sister's side, and continue to rape her and sexually abuse her. ... I know he was not called of God because God would never do something like that." Within minutes, Smart stepped down from the witness stand, ending three days of riveting testimony against the homeless street preacher accused of kidnapping her and holding her captive as his preordained "celestial" wife. Asked if she was glad it was over, Smart paused for a moment, as if carefully considering her response. She then smiled and said, "Yes." Smart, who turned 23 last week, led the jury through the ordeal she calls "my nine months in hell." She was 14 when she was snatched from her bed at knifepoint and marched into the mountains behind her home to a makeshift camp, where Mitchell "sealed" her to him as his wife. Other kidnapped girls were to come, she said Mitchell told her, and her job would be to "demonstrate" to the newcomers how to carry out their sexual duties. Smart said she initially was tethered to a cable strung between two trees. She was raped on a daily basis, forced to smoke and drink and parade around naked in a game Mitchell and wife, Wanda Barzee, called "Adam and Eve." She said he called himself Immanuel and wrote a book outlining his religious beliefs called the "Book of Immanuel David Isaiah." He called his private parts "Immanuel's Pride," and his bed "Immanuel's Altar," she testified. She said she resisted his sexual advances, once biting him as he tried to kiss her. "He said I would become accustomed and learn to love it," she said Wednesday. "He said he understood and recognized that I felt like a prostitute or a concubine or a second-class wife but that wasn't the case at all." Although Mitchell claimed to receive revelations directly from God and said he was destined for celestial glory, many of the details of his life, as described by Smart, were earthly and banal. Mitchell and Barzee constantly squabbled over her jealousy and his drinking, Smart said. He had a taste for pornography and boasted about his sexual prowess and his ability to outsmart other people. When he talked about his "ministry," he meant panhandling, Smart added. But Mitchell often was scathing in his criticism of the people who gave him money on the street. She said he talked constantly -- about himself. She never saw him show compassion, or give anyone else money or food. Except for concealing her identity, she said, he didn't show much concern for her or her family. "He said that I was the apple of their eye and that they were heartbroken I wasn't there but that they would be comforted and reassured that I was in good hands," she said. Mitchell, 57, has not been in court during Smart's testimony. As he has during every court appearance since December 2004, Mitchell closed his eyes and began singing hymns as soon as he was brought into court on Wednesday. In what has become a daily ritual, U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball brought the jury in, and intoned: "Mr. Mitchell, you have a constitutional right to be here, which you now waive if you continue to sing." In his thin, reedy voice, Mitchell went on singing about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ: "They pierced his hands and feet and side ..." He was led from the courtroom, still singing with his hands folded as if in prayer beneath his chest-length beard. According to court records, he stops the moment he enters a room equipped with audio and video feeds that allow him to view the trial. His lawyers don't dispute what happened to Smart but say Mitchell was insane, and therefore not criminally responsible for his actions. They speak of delusions that their client said provided revelations. Defense attorney Robert Steele was gentle in his brief cross-examination of Smart, mainly clarifying small points about her direct testimony. Asked about a statement she gave to a forensic psychologist shortly after she was found in March 2003, Smart conceded that her memory was probably better back then. She crisply thanked the lawyer for refreshing her memory on another point. Smart was followed by several other prosecution witnesses. The prosecution and defense agreed to what two of the witnesses had to offer, and their testimony was read into the court record as a stipulation. A waitress testified that she often served Mitchell and Barzee and saw them joined by another woman wearing a veil during the late summer or early fall of 2002. Another woman testified her husband briefly brought them home for a night or two; the women were silent but Mitchell smoked cigars and talked religion with her husband, Ada Chestnut said. An employee of The Deseret News identified Mitchell as the man who tore down a missing persons poster of Smart in the newspaper's lobby. The witness said the man told her Smart had been found. When she disputed his statement, he said he'd read the news in a competing paper, she testified. Detective Jon Richey testified about his encounter with three people, later determined to be Mitchell, Barzee and Smart, at the public library in Salt Lake City shortly after Smart's disappearance. He'd been called to investigate a tip that Smart was there, but said he considered it a "long shot." The women were dressed in robes and veils and were not permitted to speak, He said he asked to look under the younger woman's veil, but the man was insistent that he couldn't. It would violate their religion, the man said, He seemed adamant and not at all evasive or nervous, Richey told the jury. He did not appear to be mentally ill. "My impression was that he belonged to a religion or a cult that I had never heard of," he said. The trial recessed at the end of the day Wednesday for the Veteran's Day holiday and will resume Monday. It is expected to continue for another three weeks.In Session's Jean Casarez and Lena Jakobsson contributed to this story.

Doctors, aid workers get to work in Japan By the CNN Wire Staff Navigating a radiation cloud in Japan (CNN) -- A massive emergency response operation is under way in northern Japan, with world governments and international aid groups coming together to bring relief to the beleaguered island nation. So far, 91 countries and regions and 6 international organizations have extended offers of assistance, Japan's foreign affairs ministry said. The Japanese government has received 11 urban search and rescue teams, including teams from the United States, South Korea, Australia, Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, China, Hungary, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Japan's own search and rescue team was in New Zealand, assisting with recovery from the recent Christchurch earthquake, when the 9.0 magnitude quake and tsunami struck on Friday. Here is a sampling of some of the latest relief efforts under way: The search for family

.United States . -- White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said U.S. officials "stand ready to assist the Japanese ... in any way that we can." . -- The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is coordinating the overall American response. The United States is also sending experts from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to offer technical assistance to the Japanese government. . -- Eight U.S. Navy ships are now at work off the Japanese coast, with five more on the way in coming days and weeks, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said. . -- Two search-and-rescue teams from the United States are working in the hard-hit coastal city of Ofunato, which was severely damaged in the quake. .China . -- Despite lingering tension between the two countries, China said Tuesday that it would "spare no efforts to provide assistance to ... the government of Japan." . "We will continue to provide necessary aid to Japan as required by the Japanese side," Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday. . -- A 15-member Chinese rescue team was assisting with relief efforts in Ofunato. The gestures come just six months after the two countries sparred in a territorial dispute over the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. .International Groups . -- The Red Cross has 85 medical teams operating out of hospitals and mobile clinics treating survivors. Each team includes a trained psychosocial nurse, who allows survivors to voice their grief and anxieties, as well discuss practical concerns. The Japanese Red Cross has 2,400 trained psychosocial nurses. . -- The Red Cross estimates that more than 430,000 people are housed in some 2,500 evacuation centres, mostly in schools and other public buildings.

. Corporate and Individuals . -- Individuals, companies and charities had donated nearly $23 million by Monday to aid in the earthquake and tsunami recovery effort, according to a report in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Still, the number is far below the first four-day totals of other recent natural disasters. More than $150 million was raised toward relief within four days of the crisis in Haiti, the same publication noted. . -- Two American telecommunications companies are offering free phone calls to Japan over the next several weeks. AT&T will not charge U.S. residential customers for calls made to Japan between March 11 and March 31. Texting is also free during the same period. Time Warner Cable is extending a similar offer, making all direct calls to Japan free of charge between March 11 and April 15. . -- The General Motors Foundation has approved a $500,000 donation to the American Red Cross relief fund for Japan. . -- Aflac made a 100 million yen (U.S. $1.2 million) donation to the International Red Cross to aid in disaster relief after the insurance giant fired Gilbert Gottfried, the comedian who provides the voice for the duck in the company's commericals. He was tweeting jokes about the disaster. . -- Japan-based Honda Motor Company said it will donate 300 million yen (U.S. $3.7 million) toward relief and recovery. It is also providing 1,000 gas- and gasoline-powered generators. Honda in North American will match contributions from employees for the Red Cross, with no corporate limit. .Celebrities . -- The Black Eyed Peas have joined a growing list of artists and celebrities calling attention to the disaster in Japan. The group shot their latest music video for the single "Just Can't Get Enough" in Tokyo a few days before the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami rocked the island nation. The video opens: "This video was filmed in Japan one week before the earthquake. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people of Japan. We love you." The video closes with a link to the Red Cross.

Singer Whitney Houston dies at 48
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 11:01 PM EST, Sat February 11, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Aretha Franklin calls news "stunning"
Houston's bodyguard found her body, boyfriend's publicist says
A tribute is expected at Sunday night's Grammy Awards
The entertainer had struggled with addiction problems
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Legendary pop singer Whitney Houston was found dead Saturday at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel, officials said. She was 48.
The entertainer, whose incredible talent was discovered at an early age, was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. (6:55 p.m. ET) at the Beverly Hilton hotel despite resuscitation efforts, a police spokesman said.
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mark Rosen said there were "no obvious signs of criminal intent" and that the cause of her death is being investigated.
Houston's bodyguard found her body, said Courtney Barnes, publicist for hip-hop artist Ray J, who was dating the pop diva.
According to her official website, Houston sold more than 170 million albums, singles and videos. But she also struggled with addiction problems over the years.
Houston, whose hits included "The Greatest Love of All," died on the eve of the 54th annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. She had performed as late as Thursday night at a pre-Grammy event in the area. A pre-Grammy party was scheduled Saturday night at the Beverly Hilton.

Clive Davis on Whitney Houston
Whitney Houston seemed 'in good spirits'
Music producer Jimmy Jam, after conversations with those heading up to Sunday's night show, told CNN that he believes the event will change significantly -- including a tribute to the singer.
The entertainer recently returned to a movie set for "Sparkle," a remake of the 1976 hit, which was loosely based on the story of The Supremes. It is scheduled be released nationwide in August, according to Sony Pictures. It was her first movie role since 1996's "The Preacher's Wife."
News of her death elicited a flood of reaction from fans and fellow celebrities alike.
Singer Aretha Franklin said, "I just can't talk about it now. It's so stunning and unbelievable. I couldn't believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen. My heart goes out to Cissy (Houston's mother), her daughter Bobbi Kris, her family and Bobby (Brown)."
Dolly Parton, who wrote "I Will Always Love You," said, "mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'"
Another entertainment legend, Quincy Jones, said he was "absolutely heartbroken" by the news. "She was a true original and a talent beyond compare," he said.
Houston's body of work included a string of Billboard No. 1 hits in the 1980s, including "Saving All My Love for You," "How Will I Know," "The Greatest Love of All," "Where Do Broken Hearts Go," and "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)."
Billboard put her soundtrack to the 1992 movie "The Bodyguard" as one of the top 10 biggest-selling albums of all time. She also starred in the film with Kevin Costner. The soundtrack included the hit,"I Will Always Love You."
Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey.
Famed music producer Clive Davis reportedly spotted Houston 20 years later in a New York nightclub, signing her on the spot, according to her website. Davis steered Houston's career for more than 25 years, also serving as a mentor.
Just Thursday, Davis told CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight" that, with Houston, "I saw a depth and a range and soul ... that rarely ranks at the top level. And that's why we've been working together ever since."
The singer's rendition of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl, days into the first Persian Gulf War, earned raves and cemented her place in the American musical landscape.
After "The Bodyguard," Houston went on to appear in several more films in the 1990s, including "Waiting to Exhale."
In 2000, Houston earned her sixth Grammy for best female R&B performance and, a month later, she was named female artist of the decade at the "Soul Train" Music Awards.
Her career stalled, however, in subsequent years as she entered rehab for addiction problems.
Houston took a hiatus for several years before releasing her first album in seven years, "I Look to You," in 2009.
"I just took a break, which sometimes you have to," said Houston. "You have to know when to slow that train down and kind of just sit back and relax for a minute."
In May 2011, Houston got help for her much-publicized struggle with drugs and alcohol, her representative said at the time.
In a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston recalled how her mother arrived one day at her doorstep at her daughter's house with sheriff's officers and a court order in a drug intervention. She talked about doing cocaine and smoking marijuana.
"(My mother) says, 'I have a court (injunction) here,'" Houston said. "Either you do it my way, or we're just not going to do this at all. We are both going to go on TV, and you're going to retire.'"
Houston had a high-profile and tumultuous marriage to Bobby Brown, a former "New Edition" star who has had multiple brushes with the law.
The couple appeared together in the mid-2000s on the reality show "Being Bobby Brown." They had one child together, Bobbi Kristina.
Houston was the cousin of Dionne Warwick, another acclaimed performer.
Singer Lionel Richie told CNN that Houston was one of the best.
"She had that voice that could just turn a story, a melody into magical notes," Richie said.
CNN's Denise Quan and Alan Duke contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: 100 people are reported dead around Syria on Monday, an opposition group says
Human Rights Watch says the Syrian government is using Soviet-made cluster bombs
The claims are "untrue," a report from Syria's state-run news agency says
Cluster bombs release dozens of smaller bombs, which can maim or kill long after impact
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
(CNN) -- Syria denied Monday a report that its forces have been using cluster bombs in its civil war.
"The General Command of the Army and the Armed Forces stressed on Monday that the misleading media outlets have recently published untrue news claiming the Syrian Arab Army has been using cluster bombs against terrorists," the government's term for rebels, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
"In a statement, the General Command said the Syrian Army does not possess such bombs, stressing that those news (reports) are untrue and come in the framework of misleading media which is aimed at diverting the public opinion from the practices of the armed terrorist groups against civilians."
The report came a day after the publication of a human rights report that accuses the Syrian air force of using Russian-made cluster bombs.

Syrian children's lasting trauma Rebels in Syria claim more advances
Citing videos and witness accounts, Human Rights Watch said Syrian government forces were using the bombs. The report says the cluster bombs are Soviet-made, but it also says it's unclear how or when Syria may have acquired them.
"Syria's disregard for its civilian population is all too evident in its air campaign, which now apparently includes dropping these deadly cluster bombs into populated areas," said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch. "Cluster bombs have been comprehensively banned by most nations, and Syria should immediately stop all use of these indiscriminate weapons that continue to kill and maim for years."
Russia questioned the report's veracity. "There is no confirmation to this," Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, according to Russia's state-owned RIA Novosti news agency. "There are loads of weapons in this region, including in Syria and other countries of the region, and arms are supplied there in large quantities and illegally."
The bombs are particularly dangerous because they explode in the air, sending dozens or hundreds of smaller bombs over an area the size of a football field, Human Rights Watch said.
"These bomblets often fail to explode on initial impact, leaving duds that act like landmines and explode when handled," the group said.
More than 70 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs; neither Syria nor the United States is among them.
"Cluster munitions have demonstrated military utility," the U.S. State Department says on its website. "Their elimination from U.S. stockpiles would put the lives of its soldiers and those of its coalition partners at risk. Moreover, cluster munitions can often result in much less collateral damage than unitary weapons, such as a larger bomb or larger artillery shell would cause, if used for the same mission."
In other developments:
Turkey searches Syria-bound plane
For the second time in a week, Turkish officials on Monday searched a civilian plane that had been headed to Syria.
Armenian and Turkish diplomats told CNN that an Armenian cargo plane that had been en route to Aleppo stopped first on Monday morning in the Turkish city of Erzurum for an inspection of its cargo.
The move appeared to be part of Turkey's enforcement of a newly adopted blockade against the Syrian government.
Unlike last week's grounding of a Syrian passenger plane flying from Moscow to Damascus, Monday's airplane inspection appeared to have been agreed to ahead of time by Armenian and Turkish authorities.
After the search, which lasted at least five hours, the Armenian cargo plane was allowed to continue to Syria.
"The plane is transporting humanitarian aid to Syria and its stop in Turkey was planned," Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Tigran Balayan told CNN in an e-mail.
"The Turks, from our perspective, are taking a measured and appropriate posture with regard to these things," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters.
Syria and Turkey have closed their airspace to each others' aircraft.
The heightened tension between the two countries has alarmed U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. undersecretary for political affairs, told the Security Council on Monday.
Also Monday, the Council of the European Union strengthened its sanctions against the Syrian government, adding 28 people deemed responsible for violence against the civilian population to a list of those subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze. That brings the total to 181 people and 54 entities.
The council, in its 19th round of sanctions against Damascus, also banned EU nationals and businesses "from supplying financial services to Syrian arms exports, including insurance and re-insurance," it said in a statement.
"We call on all states to refrain from delivering arms to Syria and to follow the EU in stopping the supplies that fuel the fighting," EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said in a statement.
In addition, the council denied Syrian Arab Airlines access to EU airports.
Diplomatic front: Special envoy to Syria visits Iran and Iraq
Seeking to forge a solution to Syria's bloody civil war, international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi visited the country's key ally in the region, Iran, before heading Monday to Iraq.
Brahimi met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and called for an end to the flow of arms to both sides of the conflict, Brahimi's spokesman said.
Rebel fighters have accused Iran of sending advisers to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad put down the popular uprising.
Before Brahimi departed Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi handed him a "written and unofficial proposal" for resolving the Syrian crisis, Iran's IRNA news agency reported Monday. Details of the plan were not publicized.
In Baghdad, Brahimi met with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. "Iraq fully supports the joint U.N. and Arab efforts in order to reach a political solution to the deepening crisis in Syria," al-Maliki said in a statement issued by his office.
Brahimi, the U.N.-Arab League joint special envoy to Syria, is visiting key countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Over the weekend, he met in Istanbul with Turkish officials and with Syrian opposition leaders in an effort to broker a cease-fire.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly denounced al-Assad, accusing him of massacring his own people and calling for his resignation.
Turkey is hosting about 100,000 Syrian refugees, and cross-border shelling that killed five Turkish civilians has led to a heightened confrontation between the two neighbors.
Syria has berated its former ally, accusing Turkey of arming and funding Syrian rebels. CNN journalists have witnessed assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns being taken from Turkey to rebels inside Syria.
The violence is showing no sign of abating. On Monday, 100 people were killed nationwide, the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria said, including 34 in and around Damascus and 29 in Aleppo.
The World Health Organization condemned attacks on health facilities in Syria, saying they have damaged such facilities across the country, "limiting access and the provision of essential health services."
It added, "almost 67% of public hospitals have been affected as a result of the conflict and 29% of those affected are out of service."
Background The opposition says more than 30,000 people have been killed since March 2011, when anti-government protesters took to the streets calling for political reform and an end to four decades of Assad family rule. The government responded with a violent clampdown, spawning an armed conflict that has spiraled into a civil war.
CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties in Syria because the government has restricted access by international journalists.
CNN's Samira Said, Holly Yan and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.

Gmail allows 10 GB file sharing with Google Drive
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 5:38 AM EST, Thu November 29, 2012 | Filed under: Web
New integration between Gmail and Google Drive lets users share files 400 times bigger than previously allowed.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New Gmail tool allows sharing of files up to 10 GB
Feature uses Google Drive, the company's cloud storage
10 GB is 400 times the data currently shareable with Gmail
(CNN) -- Frustrated that you can't share files the size of your entire music collection via e-mail? Google wants to help.
Gmail users can now send files of up to 10 GB using Google Drive, the Web giant's cloud-storage service.
That's 400 times bigger than files that can be shared in a regular e-mail, according to a blog post by Google's Gmail team.
And because the files are stored in the cloud, all recipients will always have the latest version of the file -- in the case of a document that's being amended over time, for example.
How a fake Google news story spread online
Why is Google being investigated?
"So whether it's photos from your recent camping trip, video footage from your brother's wedding, or a presentation to your boss, all your stuff is easy to find and easy to share with Drive and Gmail," the post reads.
Drive, and before that Google Docs, already allowed users to share large files. But the new feature is more streamlined, letting them do so without leaving Gmail.
Launched in April, Google Drive offers users 5 GB of free storage, with each additional 25 GB going for $2.49.
The move is part of an ongoing effort by Google to synchronize its various services, from Gmail to social network Google Plus to the Android mobile operating system. The ability to sync with Gmail offers Google a built-in edge over standalone cloud storage tools like Dropbox.
"Should services like Dropbox be concerned? Sort of," wrote Ricardo Bilton of VentureBeat. "As the move shows, Google's core strength is in its ability to connect and integrate its various services -- even the unpopular ones -- into one cohesive product. This gives Drive a clear edge over competing standalone cloud services, so expect Google to leverage it as much as possible."
The file-sharing feature will be rolled out over the next few days, according to Google. Users must have opted in to Gmail's "Compose" tool in order to use it.
Google announced this year that Gmail has more than 425 million active users.

Box office report: 'Die Hard' holds off 'Safe Haven' with $25 million
By Grady Smith, EW
updated 7:40 AM EST, Mon February 18, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"A Good Day to Die Hard" had a weaker than expected weekend
The Bruce Willis film still managed to beat "Safe Haven"
"Beautiful Creatures" had an ugly debut
(EW.com) -- Bruce Willis' return as John McClane, A Good Day to Die Hard, topped the box office over the Friday-to-Sunday period, but with a weaker-than-expected $25 million. Fox's $92 million thriller, which also stars Jai Courtney, earned $8.2 million on Thursday, its first day of release, and after four days, it's earned $33.2 million. That's a substantially weaker start than 2007′s Live Free or Die Hard, which started with $33.4 million in its opening three-day weekend.
Die Hard's middling performance isn't a total surprise. This has been a remarkably tough winter for male-driven action vehicles, many of which star members of The Expendables. Arnold Schwarznegger's $45 million entry The Last Stand has earned just $12 million after five weekends. Sylvester Stallone's Bullet to the Head, which reportedly cost $55 million, has only earned about $10 million after three. The Jason Statham thriller Parker cost about $35 million but has only grossed $17 million after nearly a month in theaters. The Mark Wahlberg/Russell Crowe shoot-em-up Broken City has languished with $19.5 million against a $35 million budget. (Meanwhile, 2013′s top four highest-grossing movies — Identity Thief, Mama, Warm Bodies, and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters — all feature women in leading roles.)
Obviously, A Good Day to Die Hard has already earned more than each of those aforementioned flops, though, and it shouldn't be written off as a misfire. The film's $7,036 per theater average from 3,553 theaters was strong, and with a "B+" CinemaScore grade, it may benefit from word-of-mouth in the weeks to come. Prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend, and it remains to be seen whether it can match Live Free or Die Hard's $134.5 million finish, but Fox can rest easy thanks to Die Hard's strong international performance so far. The film earned a tremendous $61.5 million overseas this weekend, bringing its international haul to $80.1 million and its worldwide cume to $113.4 million. Those overseas results may keep John McClane Yippee-Ki-Yaying for years to come.
Last weekend's champ, Identity Thief, dipped only 32 percent to $23.4 million in its second weekend. The Melissa McCarthy/Jason Bateman laugher has now earned $70.7 million against a slim $35 million budget, and, for Universal, it's the latest in a hot-streak of sensibly budgeted hits that almost (almost) make up for the fact that the studio spent $209 million on Battleship, which earned only $65.4 million, last year. With the exception of The Man with the Iron Fists, every Universal film since the fall has been a profitable venture: Pitch Perfect ($65 million vs. $17 million budget), This is 40 ($67.4 million vs. $35 million budget), Les Miserables ($145.5 million vs. $61 million budget), Mama ($68.3 million vs. $15 million budget), and now Identity Thief. Next up on the studio's plate? The surefire smash Fast & Furious 6.
Close behind in third place, Relativity's $28 million Nicholas Sparks adaptation Safe Haven opened with $21.4 million. Including Valentine's Day grosses, the goopy romance, which stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel, has earned a solid $30.5 million. Relativity did a great job of marketing Safe Haven as the top choice for Valentine's Day couples, and the built-in cachet of Nicholas Sparks continues to prove irresistible for many moviegoers. Among all eight Sparks films, Safe Haven's $21.4 million frame trails the opening weekends of just Dear John ($30.5 million) and The Lucky One ($22.5 million), which finished with $80 million and $60.5 million, respectively.
For star Hough, who's made the transition from Dancing with the Stars pro to fledgling country singer (remember?) to Hollywood leading lady, Safe Haven represents her best-ever opening weekend following underwhelming debuts from Burlesque ($11.9 million), Footloose ($15.6 million), and Rock of Ages ($14.6 million). She may carve out an acting career, yet. Like Die Hard, Safe Haven missed with critics, but earned a "B+" CinemaScore grade from audiences, which were 71 percent female and 68 percent below the age of 25.
Weinstein's animated effort Escape from Planet Earth benefited from the fact that no family films have hit theaters in almost two months and finished in fourth place with $16.1 million. Facing no family competition, Escape, which cost $40 million, fared better than Weinstein's last attempt to get into the animation game, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, which bombed with just $10.1 million in April 2011. Despite poor reviews, Escape from Planet Earth wound up with a "B+" CinemaScore grade.
Rounding out the Top 5 was Summit's Warm Bodies, which fell only 20 percent to $9 million, giving it a $50.2 million total. While the YA adaptation hasn't become the next Twilight, positive word-of-mouth has helped Warm Bodies, which cost about $35 million, avoid the steep drops that usually plague films aimed at teens. It could finish with about $65 million.
Fellow YA tale Beautiful Creatures didn't earn such a Warm reception on its opening weekend. The witch-y tale bombed with only $7.5 million — $10 million including Valentine's Day grosses. Warner Bros. is distributing the film, which was financed for $60 million by Alcon Entertainment. Fortunately for the distributor, its other recent release, The Hobbit, is on pace to pass $300 million at the domestic box office on Monday. Audiences issued Beautiful Creatures a lukewarm "B" CinemaScore grade.
1. A Good Day to Die Hard -- $25 million ($33.2 million total)
2. Safe Haven -- $21.4 million ($30.5 million total)
3. Identity Thief -- $23.4 million ($70.7 million total)
4. Escape from Planet Earth -- $16.1 million ($16.1 million total)
5. Warm Bodies -- $9 million ($50.2 million total)
6. Beautiful Creatures -- $7.5 million ($10 million total)

EasyJet Moscow route will attract business travel
By CNN wire staff
updated 1:23 PM EDT, Thu March 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
EasyJet boss McCall estimates about one third of passengers on the flight from London to Moscow
McCall -- who was appointed CEO in July 2010 -- says the biggest challenge is cost advantage
"Our biggest cost after fuel is airports," says Chief Executive Carolyn McCall
(CNN) -- EasyJet's new London to Moscow route is an opportunity to attract more business travelers, according to the low cost airline's chief executive.
In an interview with CNN's Nina Dos Santos, Carolyn McCall estimates that about one third of passengers on the four hour flight from London to Moscow would be traveling on business.
The British carrier -- known for its bargain basement flights and tangerine-colored aircraft -- beat seven other airline giants to secure the rights to the London-Moscow route.
But McCall tells CNN: "We were convinced we had a good shot with this; we have a very credible position for business passengers... all the other airlines were focused on Heathrow not Gatwick and were very much focused on the front cabin and the premium experience."
McCall -- who was appointed CEO in July 2010 -- says the biggest challenge facing the company today is maintaining cost advantage over its competitors.
She says: "Our biggest cost after fuel is airports; there is a huge focus from us on making sure we only pay an airport for what we use."
Efficiency and low operation overheads are central to the airline's business model, according to McCall. "I think it is very difficult for legacy carriers to compete with us on price and fares because they don't have the cost structure that we have."

Official: Dead Boston bombings suspect involved in 2011 slayings
By Susan Candiotti. Ashleigh Banfield. Deborah Feyerick. and Carol Cratty, CNN
updated 8:49 AM EDT, Thu May 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dead Boston bombing suspect implicated in 2011 killings, official says
Another man, Ibragim Todashev, attacks FBI agent with a knife, is killed
Todashev had admitted to a role in a 2011 triple murder in Massachusetts
Authorities told him not to take a pending flight to Chechnya
(CNN) -- Deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in a 2011 gruesome triple homicide outside Boston along with a Chechen killed early Wednesday during a confrontation with the FBI and Massachusetts State Police in Orlando, Florida, a federal law enforcement official told CNN.
Ibragim Todashev, who died during the interview with authorities, not only confessed to his direct role in slashing the throats of three people in Waltham, Massachusetts, but also fingered Tsarnaev in the deaths, the official said Wednesday.
Todashev was being questioned about the slayings and his acquaintance with Tsarnaev.
Todashev attacked an FBI agent, who shot him dead, a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, identified as Suspect 2, was captured in a Boston suburb on April 19 after a manhunt that shut down the city.
From left, Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev went with Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to Times Square in this photo taken from the social media site VK.com. A federal grand jury charged Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice on Thursday, August 8. Both had been arrested and charged in May, but only with the conspiracy count. See all photography related to the Boston bombings.
Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was also arrested on May 1. He was charged with lying to federal agents about the bombing, according to court papers.
Phillipos, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the April 15 bombings. The items they took included a backpack containing fireworks that had been "opened and emptied of powder," according to the affidavit.
Kadybayev, left, poses with Dzhokhar Tsamaev in a picture taken from the social media site VK.com. The FBI released photos and video on April 18 of two men identified as Suspect 1 and Suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. They were later identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26.
Police say the dead suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is the man the FBI identified as Suspect 1. He was killed during the shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts, early April 19. He is pictured here at the 2010 New England Golden Gloves.
Boston Police released surveillance images of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at a convenience store on April 19.
The FBI tweeted this photo on April 19 and urged Watertown residents to stay indoors as they searched for the second suspect.
The FBI released photos and video on April 18 of two men it called suspects in the deadly bombings and pleaded for public help in identifying them. The men were photographed walking together near the finish line.
A man identified as Suspect 2 appeared in this photograph by bystander David Green, who took the photo after completing the Boston Marathon. Green submitted the photo to the FBI, he told Piers Morgan in an interview.

Photos: Suspects tied to Boston bombings
FBI shoots man tied to bombing suspects
Police: Man linked to Tsarnaev shot
"He used some kind of weapon," the official said, and that prompted the FBI agent to shoot the suspect.
A second law enforcement official confirmed Todashev made the confession.
The unsolved triple murder received renewed interest after it was learned that Tsarnaev was sparring partners at a local gym with one of the victims.
Source: 2011 slayings of Tsarnaev friend, 2 others revisited
Investigators of the crime reported at the time that the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force. Marijuana was spread over the bodies in a "symbolic gesture," and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene.
Todashev told investigators the men were killed during a drug ripoff because he and Tsarnaev were afraid they would be able to identify them and tell police what happened, according to a law enforcement source.
So far, no link has been found between Todashev and the Boston Marathon bombings. However, the FBI is looking into the many connections between Todashev and Tsarnaev, whose radicalization allegedly led to the Boston bombings.
A federal law enforcement official has told CNN they were initially led to Todashev because they learned he knew Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar. They also said cell phone records connected Tamerlan and Todashev.
Todashev was being interviewed in the kitchen of his Florida home. He grabbed a knife, which is why fatal force was used, according to a source briefed on the ongoing investigation.
"Preliminary information indicates the agent took actions to defend himself," said a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case.
"The agent sustained non-life-threatening injuries," FBI spokesman Jason Pack said.
Investigators are awaiting test results to determine whether Todashev's DNA was found at the Massachusetts triple murder scene and whether the DNA of Tamerlan Tsarnaev also was found there.
Todashev and Tsarnaev were acquainted through a mixed martial arts center near Boston, said a source briefed on the bombing investigation.
In Orlando, an FBI team is reviewing the circumstances of the shooting, a procedure that follows any FBI shooting.
Todashev had an impending flight from Orlando, via New York and Moscow, to Chechnya, when investigators sought to interview him, according to a source briefed on the ongoing investigation. He was told not to take the flight, the source said.
Details emerged Wednesday about how Todashev had Tsarnaev's phone number in his cell phone, said the source.
Both men were members of the mixed martial arts forum Sherdog.com, along with Russian-Canadian boxer-turned-jihadist William Plotnikov, the source said.
Last month, CNN reported that Plotnikov and six others died in a July 2012 firefight with Russian forces in the southwestern republic of Dagestan, while Tsarnaev was visiting the region, according to a source briefed on the investigation.
Todashev, 27, knew Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, also a suspect in the April 15 bombings, the official said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, injured and captured after a manhunt, is being held by authorities. His brother died in a shootout with police.
Todashev was from the Chechnya region, as were the Tsarnaev brothers, the source said.
Todashev was granted political asylum in 2008, but he came to the United States some time before that, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Todashev had been living in the United States as a legal resident because of that asylum claim.
In the 2011 Massachusetts triple homicide, the Middlesex County district attorney's office said at the time that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to know each other and that it was not a random crime. No suspects were named then.
Suspect: Bombing was payback for hits on Muslims
A source said that the FBI had been investigating Todashev for about a month.
The FBI had followed Todashev for days, his friend told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13.
Todashev "wasn't like real close friends (with Tsarnaev), but he just happened to know him," Khasuen Taramov told the TV station. "But he had no idea that they were up to something like that, like bombings and everything, you know what I mean?"
He told CNN affiliate WESH that Todashev and Tsarnaev had spoken by telephone about a month before the bombings.
"It was a complete shock to him," Taramov said.
The two met a couple years ago in Boston, where Todashev had lived and where there is a small, close-knit community of Chechens, said Taramov.
Their telephone conversation before the bombings contained nothing but routine pleasantries, he said. "It was 'How are you doing; how's your family?' That's all."
Taramov said he himself was questioned by the FBI for three hours Tuesday night. Asked what he was asked, Taramov said, "Different kind of questions like 'what do you think about bombings,' 'do you know these guys,' blah blah blah, what is my views on certain stuff."
He said Todashev was not a radical. "He was just a Muslim. That was his mistake, I guess."
Taramov said his friend had told him he had a bad feeling about the direction the investigation was heading.
"He felt like there's going to be a setup ... bad setup against him. Because he told me, 'They are making up such crazy stuff, I don't know ... why they doing it. OK, I'm answering the questions, but they are still making up some, like, connections, some crazy stuff. I don't know why they are doing it.' "
Before meeting with the FBI for a 7:30 p.m. interview Tuesday, Taramov said, his friend asked him to take his parents' telephone numbers. "He just told me, 'Take the numbers, in case something happens, if I get locked up, or whatever, call them.' You know what I mean?
"We were expecting to get him locked up, but not getting him killed. I can't believe it."
Todashev was unemployed and had been living on insurance money he received after surgery for an accident. "He used to be a fighter, MMA fighter," Taramov said, in a reference to mixed martial arts.
Todashev was arrested this month on a charge of aggravated battery after getting into a fight over a parking spot with a man and his son outside an Orlando mall. The son was taken to a hospital with head injuries, a split upper lip and several teeth knocked out of place, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a report.
"Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March," the report said. He told the police that he was a former mixed martial arts fighter, it said.
Todashev, described as 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds, was released on $3,500 bond.
Asked about the incident, Taramov downplayed it. "He had a fight in the parking lot, the two guys jumped on him ... pretty much he just defended himself against two," he told WESH. "The only mistake: he did kick their ass and left."
Todashev had recently gotten his green card and had been planning to visit his parents in Chechnya and then return to the United States, but canceled the plans, Taramov said.
Now, he added, he was planning to call his friend's parents.

8 very old sites in the New World
By Leslie Gilbert Elman, Special to CNN
updated 9:48 AM EST, Wed December 25, 2013
The archaeological site of Tiwanaku was built at 13,000 feet above sea level in the Altiplano of the Bolivian Andes.
A view of the Kalasasaya temple in the archaeological site at Tiwanaku hints at the civilization that thrived here between 500 and 900 A.D.
Tourists walk among the Akapana ruins at the archaeological site of Tiwanaku.
Sandstone formations make up the badlands of Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada.
A fossilized bone can be seen exposed on the ground at Dinosaur Provincial Park.
Changing light creates spectacular effects across the landscape of Dinosaur Provincial Park.
The Mayan temples at Tikal poke above the treeline in the Petén department of Guatemala.
The pyramids at Tikal were probably built between 250 and 900 AD and situated to correspond with the position of the sun.
Tikal National Park also encompasses Uaxactún -- once a separate city -- as well as nearly 55,000 acres of rainforest that add to its beauty and mystery. Monte Albán in Oaxaca, Mexico, is a marvel of urban planning, especially when you consider that the Olmecs -- and later the Zapotecs -- who built it did so by carving its terraced landscape out of the mountainside.
Monte Alban was built to be grand, from the ceremonial pyramids to the stadium surrounding the ball court (seen here). The Olmec civilization is known for colossal stone heads like this one seen at Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa, Mexico.
Visitors will find more than 30 Olmec sculptures, including three 20-ton heads, at Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa.
The capital of the Chimú culture, Chan Chan in Peru, probably dates back to before 850 A.D. This is a ceremonial hall known as Tschudi Palace.
A detail of a low relief on the Temple of La Huaca del Dragon in Chan Chan is seen here.
Cahokia Mounds looks like a grouping of giant lumps in the earth built by the Mississippian culture more than 1,000 years ago near what is now Collinsville, Illinois.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Things were happening in the 'New World' a long, long time ago
See where the dinosaurs roamed at Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta
Explore marvels of the Olmec culture in Tabasco and Oaxaca, Mexico
(CNN) -- When European explorers were planting their flags all over North and South America, they referred to the territory as the "New World." That was a misnomer. For while the Americas might have been "new" to the Europeans, they weren't new on the world timeline.
Things were happening in the Western Hemisphere a long, long time ago, as the sites on this list (a very small sampling) demonstrate. Some you might know already; others might come as a surprise. Many of them are sites of active archaeological research that continues to unearth new examples of very interesting old stuff.
15 ancient ruins you might not know
Tiwanaku, Bolivia
Theorists have explained Tiwanaku as everything from a temple complex built by nomads to the work of an extraterrestrial society. Its truth is only slightly less extraordinary, and it tantalizes with questions of why and how a city of temples, public buildings, homes, streets and irrigation systems was built at 13,000 feet above sea level in the Altiplano of the Bolivian Andes.
Between 500 and 900 A.D., the Tiwanaku civilization numbered in the hundreds of thousands. By 1200, they were gone. Archaeologists continue to study the site, even constructing reed boats to demonstrate how stones weighing several tons might have been transported from one shore of nearby Lake Titicaca to the other. You'll need imagination to picture Tiwanaku as it was; a visit during the winter or summer solstice celebrations can enhance its mystical qualities.
Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada
About 75 million years ago, western Canada was part of an island continent called Laramidia, and this 30-square-mile expanse of badlands was populated by creatures great and small. Sounds like the start of a fantasy novel, but it's a dream come true for anyone fascinated by dinosaurs.
UNESCO adds 19 sites to World Heritage List
Since the turn of the last century, when paleontologists began working here in earnest, the park has yielded thousands of prehistoric remains, including hundreds of complete dinosaur skeletons from the Late Cretaceous Period.
At the park you can join in or observe current fieldwork. There are activities for families and kids, guided and self-guided tours, and sunset excursions for photographers. To see more specimens recovered from the park, visit the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, two hours away.
Tikal, Petén, Guatemala
With its five towering pyramids, probably built between 250 and 900 A.D. (ongoing research regularly revises the dates) and situated to correspond with the position of the sun, Tikal is the site by which other Mayan archaeological sites are measured, both in scope and significance. Tikal National Park also encompasses Uaxactún -- once a separate city -- as well as nearly 55,000 acres of rainforest that add to its beauty and mystery.
The Petén Region in northern Guatemala continually yields archaeological discoveries from the Maya, such as the stunning frieze found in Holmul earlier this year. The murals at San Bartolo are under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage site status. In neighboring Honduras, is the Mayan site of Copán -- founded by a splinter group from Tikal.
Monte Albán, Oaxaca, Mexico
Monte Albán is a marvel of urban planning, especially when you consider that the Olmecs -- and later the Zapotecs -- who built it did so by carving its terraced landscape out of the mountainside. And they began construction sometime around 500 B.C. It was built to be grand, from the ceremonial pyramids to the stadium surrounding the ball court, and because it's so impressive Monte Albán tends to be heavily visited today.
The most famous artifacts are the series of Olmec carved stone slabs known as Los Danzantes (The Dancers) because it was originally assumed they depicted dancing men. Current scholarship says they depict disemboweled prisoners of war, which would be strange, yet in keeping with the unusual artistic sensibilities of the Olmecs.
Parque Museo La Venta, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico
It's hard to know what to think about the Olmecs. They practiced ritual human bloodletting and raised dogs that they subsequently ate as part of their regular diet. On the other hand, they're probably responsible for introducing chocolate to the world. They also left a wondrous legacy of carved stone sculptures, especially the enormous stone heads for which they're known.
Many Olmec sculptures discovered at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán in Veracruz and at La Venta in Tabasco -- Olmec settlements dating back to 1200 B.C. -- have been relocated to museums where they're more accessible for public viewing. You'll find more than 30, including three 20-ton heads, at Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. The 16-acre park is known for its tropical foliage and for the dramatic sound and light show that illuminates the sculptures at night.
Chan Chan, Peru
Machu Picchu is the most widely known archaeological site in Peru, the Nazca Lines are arguably the most mysterious, but Chan Chan, located about three miles from Trujillo, deserves mention because while its past is documented, its future is uncertain.
The capital of the Chimú culture, Chan Chan probably dates back to before 850 A.D. At its peak in the early 1400s it had a population of 30,000 before the Inca came and wiped it all out. What remains of the huge earthwork city is still astounding -- networks of beautifully carved and sculpted adobe walls delineate enclaves devoted to work, worship and family life.
About five square miles of the Chan Chan site is on the UNESCO World Heritage list, but even UNESCO can't stop the wind and weather from slowly eroding Chan Chan.
Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, Collinsville, Illinois, United States
Cahokia Mounds looks like a grouping of giant lumps in the earth -- hills where no hills should be, built by the Mississippian culture more than 1,000 years ago. The largest is 100 feet high and bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza at its base.
Around it once stood wooden houses and plazas where people gathered for ceremonies that involved a potent concoction called Black Drink and competitions in a vigorous sport called chunkey. Inside the mounds, archaeologists have found a wealth of objects including unexpected specimens like shark's teeth carried from the Gulf of Mexico to western Illinois in some way yet to be determined. In fact, much of what went on at Cahokia is still undetermined, including why this thriving community -- the oldest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico -- disappeared in the early 14th century.
Rock Art of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, Texas, United States
Around Comstock, Texas, where the Pecos River meets the Rio Grande, acres of unremarkable terrain hold a remarkable surprise: cave paintings (pictographs) and carvings (petroglyphs) made by the prehistoric hunter-gatherers who lived here thousands of years ago. They're not especially easy to reach, which has been their salvation, having left them largely unmolested throughout the centuries.
Recently archaeologists have been working to raise awareness of the sites in order to catalog, preserve and protect them. Guided tours at Seminole Canyon State Park take you on a rigorous 1.5-mile hike to the Fate Bell Shelter. Other tours conducted by members of the nonprofit Rock Art Foundation visit sites located on private land. Panther Cave and Parida Cave in the Amistad National Recreation Area near Del Rio are accessible by boat.
