GAZA CITY (CNN) -- Two Israeli helicopter attacks Thursday in Gaza's Rafah refugee camp have killed 10 people, according to Palestinian security and medical sources.The strikes followed Palestinian attacks on Israeli soldiers Tuesday and Wednesday that have claimed 11 soldiers' lives. This week, violence in Gaza has claimed the lives at least 33 Palestinians as well as the 11 soldiers. The fighting comes as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon works on revising his plan to withdraw military personnel and Jewish settlements from Gaza and parts of the West Bank.Israel Defense Forces began the Gaza operation Monday night, saying the mission was aimed at destroying workshops used by Palestinian terrorists to construct Qassam rockets. Israeli helicopters first attacked the camp early in the day, killing seven and wounding six others, Palestinian security sources and medical sources said. A second strike was launched around 10:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), killing three and wounding eight others, the sources said.Wednesday night, an Israeli missile strike in Rafah killed seven Palestinians, Palestinian medical sources said. Israel Defense Forces said the Palestinians were targeted because they were trying to hide an explosive device. The strikes on the camp followed an attack that killed five Israeli soldiers traveling in a convoy near Rafah, according to the IDF.Israeli remains returnedMeanwhile, Palestinian sources said a deal was reached between Palestinian militant groups and Israel for the return of body parts of six Israeli soldiers who were killed Tuesday in an attack near the Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City.The remains were returned to Israeli authorities early Thursday, Palestinian sources and Israeli security sources said. Israeli tanks and bulldozers pulled back from Zeitoun by early Thursday, Palestinian sources told CNN.Three Palestinian fundamentalist groups considered by Israel to be terrorist organizations -- Hamas, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and Islamic Jihad -- had said they were holding the body parts and intended to use them to negotiate with Israel. The recovery of all body parts is needed for proper Jewish burial rites.Hamas, Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have each conducted attacks on Israeli civilian and military targets.Sharon's proposalSharon's withdrawal proposal -- which would unilaterally withdraw Israeli military and settlements from Gaza and some regions, but not all, of the West Bank --has been praised by President Bush but was voted down in a Likud party referendum May 2.The prime minister has said the withdrawal is necessary because the Palestinian Authority had failed to rein in attacks on Israelis and because the diplomatic process is in a "frozen state."Palestinians have criticized Israel's new plan, charging Sharon is attempting to circumvent the negotiations called for in the road map to Middle East peace, which is supported by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.CNN's Talal Aburahman, Correspondent Matthew Chance in Gaza and Shira Medding in Jerusalem contributed to this report.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Bail set for terrorism suspect in ColoradoStory Highlights Three men are accused of lying to feds during terrorism investigation Arrested: Najibullah Zazi and his father in Colorado, Ahmad Wais Afzali in New York Men, originally from Afghanistan, investigated in plot to detonate bombs in U.S. If convicted, each faces eight years in prisonNext Article in Crime » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- A federal magistrate set bail at $50,000 Monday for one of the three men charged with lying to federal agents during a wide-ranging terrorism inquiry, as the men made their first appearances in courtrooms in New York and Colorado. Najibullah Zazi is accused of making false statements to officials about an alleged bomb plot in the United States. Mohammed Wali Zazi, 53, whose son is at the center of the terrorism investigation, will be allowed to go home under electronic monitoring and required to remain there except for work, medical care, religious services or court appearances, prosecutors said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Craig Shaffer in Denver, Colorado, set bail at $50,000, but Zazi is unlikely to be released until later this week. Prosecutors are asking that his son, 24-year-old Najibullah Zazi, be held until trial. Shaffer set a detention hearing for the younger Zazi for Thursday. Investigators said Najibullah Zazi has admitted attending courses and receiving instructions on weapons and explosives at an al Qaeda training facility in Pakistan's tribal areas during a 2008 trip and lied to federal agents about explosives-handling instructions they found on his computer. His attorney, Arthur Folsom, has denied the allegations. The Zazis and Ahmad Wais Afzali, a 37-year-old Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens, are the first people charged in connection with what the Justice Department has said was a plot to detonate bombs in the United States. Earlier Monday, Afzali appeared in a federal court in New York, where a not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf. He smiled as he listened to the magistrate read the charge against him, blowing kisses to his wife during the hearing. Ron Kuby, Afzali's lawyer, said his client had tried to help federal agents find Najibullah Zazi and called the charge against his client "a bootstrap case" the government brought "to cover up their own failings and the fact that they were the ones who blew this investigation." According to affidavits outlining the charges against him, Afzali warned Najibullah Zazi that his phone call was being monitored. But Kuby said Afzali was helping "absolutely frantic" federal agents find Zazi, who had attended his Queens mosque with his family as a teenager. "My client didn't tip him off, he was already tipped off," Kuby said. "And now the FBI is looking for somebody to blame." Afzali was ordered to remain in custody until a bond hearing later this week. Kuby said his client had been an occasional source for New York's Joint Terrorism Task Force when it looked into previous terror plots, and a detective who had sought out Afzali as a source in previous cases would testify on the imam's behalf Thursday. All three suspects are originally from Afghanistan. Mohammed Wali Zazi is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Afzali and Najibullah Zazi are permanent legal residents. If convicted, each faces eight years in prison. Watch why authorities wanted to talk with Zazi » The plot may have been targeting a major transportation center, such as a large railroad or subway station, sources close to the investigation said last week. Federal agents have "no specific information regarding the timing, location or target of any planned attack," David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a written statement. Court papers describe conversations among the men. At one point, according to the papers, Afzali warned Najibullah Zazi that their phone call was being monitored. "I was exposed to something yesterday from the authorities," Afzali allegedly told Zazi in a September 11 call. "And they came to ask me about your characters. They asked me about you guys. ... I told them that they are innocent, law-abiding." Afzali, however, called the questions from police "a good sign." "The bad sign is for them coming to you guys and picking you up automatically," he said. And he allegedly told the younger Zazi, "Don't get into the Afghanistan garbage, Iraq garbage. ... Listen, our phone call is being monitored." Don't Miss Terror suspect: 'Our phone call is being monitored'

The federal complaint against Afzali says he falsely asserted that he never told Zazi that agents were monitoring him on the phone, an assertion Kuby slammed. "Why on Earth is the imam going to lie to the FBI about the contents of a conversation that he knows they're recording?" Kuby asked Monday. The criminal complaint against Afzali also says he falsely told federal agents that he did not ask Zazi about evidence in his rental car. The inquiry emerged after a series of raids in Queens on September 14, three days after the intercepted calls. A police stop of Najibullah Zazi during a visit to New York raised investigators' concern that he would discover he was under surveillance, a former counterterrorism official familiar with the investigation said last week. At the Queens residence where Zazi stayed during his visit, FBI agents seized a black scale containing several AA batteries. Zazi's fingerprints were on both, the criminal complaint against him said. And agents searched his rental car and laptop computer while he was there, turning up what they said were handwritten notes of his that explained how to make, handle and detonate explosives, according to the complaint. An FBI expert determined that the handwriting in the photographed document was similar to Najibullah Zazi's, according to the complaint. But during an interview with investigators Wednesday, Zazi denied having the instructions and said that if it was found on his computer, he must have unintentionally downloaded it as part of a religious book. He said he deleted the book within days after he realized that its contents discussed a holy war, investigators said. According to court records, Mohammed Wali Zazi falsely told investigators that he had not called, nor had he received a call, from anyone in New York asking him about his son's activities. He also said he did not know anyone named Afzali, despite recorded phone calls that showed he did, the FBI stated. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

2 found dead in Michigan gas explosion By the CNN Wire Staff Furniture store flattenedSTORY HIGHLIGHTSSecond body is found in the rubble of a furniture store, official saysStore owner is in serious but stable conditionSearch and rescue crews removing rubble from the scene of the blast (CNN) -- Search crews found a second body in the ruins of a furniture store destroyed by a gas explosion in Wayne, Michigan, the city's fire chief said early Thursday. The body of a 54-year-old woman, a store employee, was pulled from the rubble of Franks Furniture around 10:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Wayne Fire Chief Mel Moore. Earlier in the day, the body of a 64-year-old man was also recovered. He was identified only as a male employee of the store, who lived in Westland, Michigan. The store's owner, Paul Franks, 64, was pulled from the wreckage shortly after the explosion, which occurred at about 9 a.m., City Manager John Zech said. He was in serious but stable condition at the University of Michigan Hospital's burn unit. Explosion rips apart furniture store

Search and rescue crews, aided by heavy equipment, continued to remove huge amounts of rubble from the scene of the blast, which damaged several buildings in addition to the furniture store. Moore said the process was made more difficult by the removal of "thousands of pounds of concrete" from the store's roof trusses. As many as 300 people were evacuated after the explosion and a second reported leak in a neighborhood adjoining the furniture store in the suburban Detroit city. As of Wednesday night, residents of all but nine homes were able to return, and were being offered lodging elsewhere for the night, said Debra Dodd, a spokeswoman for the gas utility, Consumers Energy. Mayor Abdul "Al" Haidous described Frank's Furniture as one of the "jewels" of the city, and said Franks has been a leader in civic life. "He has served this city with a great deal of integrity," the mayor said Before the explosion, a Consumers Energy gas worker was two blocks away investigating the reported gas leak, Dodd said. "We don't know at this time what caused the incident this morning," Dodd said Wednesday night, but added that the utility will work with the state Public Service Commission in investigating.

The powerhouse singer, known as "Miss Peaches," lived an eventful life. She first hit the charts as a teenager, taking "The Wallflower (Roll With Me, Henry)" -- an "answer record" to Hank Ballard's "Work With Me, Annie" -- to No. 1 on the R&B charts in 1955. She joined Chess Records in 1960 and had a string of R&B and pop hits, many with lush string arrangements. After a mid-decade fade, she re-emerged in 1967 with a more hard-edged, soulful sound.
Throughout her career, James overcame a heroin addiction, opened for the Rolling Stones, won six Grammys and was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite her ups and downs -- including a number of health problems -- she maintained an optimistic attitude.
"Most of the songs I sing, they have that blue feeling to it. They have that sorry feeling. And I don't know what I'm sorry about," she told CNN's Denise Quan in 2002. "I don't!"
Through it all, she was a spitfire beloved by contemporaries and young up-and-comers.
"Etta James is unmanageable, and I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a manager," Lupe DeLeon, her manager of 30-plus years, told CNN in admiration.
British songstress Adele named James as one of her favorite singers, along with Aretha Franklin.
"If you were to look up the word singer in the dictionary, you'd see their names," Adele said in an interview.
Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles to a teen mother and unknown father. (She suspected her father was the pool player Minnesota Fats.)
Her birth mother initially took little responsibility and James was raised by a series of people, notably a pair of boardinghouse owners. But she was recognized from a young age for her booming voice, showcased in a South Central Los Angeles church.
In 1950, her mother took her to San Francisco, where James formed a group called the Peaches. Singer Johnny Otis, best known for "Willie and the Hand Jive," discovered her and had her sing a song he wrote using Ballard's tune as a model. "The Wallflower," with responses from "Louie Louie" songwriter Richard Berry, made James an R&B star.
Her signing to Chess introduced her to a broader audience, as the record label's co-owner, Leonard Chess, believed she should do pop hits. Among her recordings were "Stormy Weather," the Lena Horne classic originally from 1933; "A Sunday Kind of Love," which dates from 1946; and most notably, "At Last," a 1941 number that was originally a hit for Glenn Miller.
James' version of "At Last" starts out with swooning strings and the singer enters with confident gusto, dazzlingly maintaining a mood of joy and romance. Though the song failed to make the Top 40 upon its 1961 release -- though it did hit the R&B Top 10 -- its emotional punch has long made it a favorite at weddings.
James' career suffered in the mid-'60s when the British Invasion took over the pop charts and as she fought some personal demons. But she got a boost when she started recording at Rick Hall's FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Her hits included the brassy "Tell Mama" and the raw "I'd Rather Go Blind," the latter later notably covered by Rod Stewart.
She entered rehab in the 1970s for her drug problem but re-established herself with live performances and an album produced by noted R&B mastermind Jerry Wexler. After another stint in rehab -- this time at the Betty Ford Clinic -- she made a comeback album, "Seven Year Itch," in 1988.
James mastered a range of styles -- from R&B and soul to jazz and blues -- but she was always one step behind the popular genre of the day, said Michael Coyle, a Colgate University professor who has written about jazz and R&B and reviews records for Cadence Magazine.
"She never really got her moment in the sun," Coyle said.
But James soldiered on, and by the end of her life she had made so much meaningful music that she was considered a living legend. "By the mid-'90s, she's survived so long that people start to look up to her," Coyle said.
James was portrayed by pop star Beyonce in the 2008 film "Cadillac Records," about Chess. After Beyonce sang "At Last" at one of President Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural balls, James lashed out: "I can't stand Beyonce. She had no business up there singing my song that I've been singing forever." She later told the New York Daily News she was joking.
Earlier this year, news reports revealed that the singer's estate was being contested in a legal struggle between her husband, Artis Mills, and son Donto James. (Donto and her other son, Sametto, both played in her band.)
Over the years, James had her share of health problems. In the late 1990s she reportedly weighed more than 400 pounds and required a scooter to get around. In 2003 she had gastric bypass surgery and dropped more than half the weight, according to People magazine.
However, until her latest issues, James maintained a steady touring schedule and appeared full of energy even when sitting down -- as she sometimes did on stage, due to bad knees and her weight battles.
Even while sitting down, James gave it her all on stage, singing as though possessed, caressing every note like a long-lost love. If that seemed a little much to critics, well, the legendary singer had a show to put on, she told Quan.
"They said that Etta James is still vulgar," she said in the 2002 interview. "I said, 'Oh, how dare 'em say I'm still real vulgar! I'm vulgar because I dance in the chair?' What would they want me to do? Want me to just be still or something like that?
"I gotta do something."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Suspect Christopher Dorner's manifesto says he is waging war against "corrupt" LAPD
Lawyers, analysts, others say the department has improved since earlier scandals
Rodney King beating, Rampart evidence-planting scandals led to court oversight, reforms
Dorner trained to be an officer, but LAPD alleged he filed a false report of excessive force (CNN) -- There's a killer on the loose and Los Angeles is on edge -- again.
This jaded city has witnessed every variety of killing, from Charles Manson and his helter-skelter spree to the Night Stalker's deadly nocturnal prowling and the random strikes of the Hillside Strangler, the Freeway Killer and the Grim Sleeper.
This one is different: The suspect is an ex-cop with an ax to grind, and he's allegedly targeting other cops. This one crosses the blue line, the one cops think separates the good guys from the bad.
This one picks at one of L.A.'s barely healed scabs, the scandals of the Los Angeles Police Department.
They began in March 1991, when George Holliday videotaped a gaggle of police officers kicking Rodney King and beating him with batons after a high-speed freeway chase. It ended, or so most people thought, in 2009 when a federal judge lifted a consent decree that threatened severe sanctions if the LAPD did not reform itself.

The subject of television and movie dramas since the 1960s and Jack Webb's "Dragnet" -- "Just the facts, ma'am" -- the LAPD has long been a flash point for controversy. It is the nation's third-largest police force, but has far fewer officers per capita and square mile than the two largest forces, in New York and Chicago. Until about 15 years ago, the department's officers where overwhelmingly white.
A couple of decades of reform seemed to make things better. Officers of color were recruited, and the department worked on community relations. About a year ago, the force nailed one of its own: a female detective who killed her romantic rival in a cold case dating back 26 years.

At the time, officials spoke of an enlightened era in which the new LAPD could investigate the old LAPD. Even the loudest critics had mostly fallen silent in recent years.
Enter Christopher Jordan Dorner, a 33-year-old, 270-pound LAPD washout who is now the most hunted man in America. He is the suspect in three killings and has dredged up the LAPD scandals in a 6,000-word rant addressed to "America" and posted on his Facebook page.
"The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days," he wrote. "It has gotten worse. The consent decree should never have been lifted."
Dorner is angry about being fired by the LAPD. He is articulate and lucid enough to trigger flashbacks to a time not so long ago when patrol officers broke their world into two categories: "blue and everybody else."
King, who died last year, was beaten by LAPD patrol officers on March 3, 1991 while a supervisor stood by. Three officers and a sergeant were tried a year later, and acquitted of the most serious charges. The LAPD watched as parts of the city erupted in rioting that left 53 dead and damaged $1 billion worth of property.
An investigation revealed that racism, brutality and adversarial attitudes were so ingrained that it didn't even occur to officers to hide them. The inquiry documented a culture in which cops openly talked with each other about beating suspects -- "attitude adjustments," they called it -- and labeled a group of African-Americans as "gorillas in the mist," a popular movie title during the Rodney King era.
Six years after the riots, another scandal exposed more corruption and even deeper cover-ups, implicating members of an elite anti-gang unit at the LAPD's Rampart division, home to some of the city's most vicious gangs.

Rogue cop Rafael Perez was accused in 1998 of stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker. He admitted shooting and paralyzing an unarmed teenager and planting a gun so he could claim self defense. The boy was sent to prison but later exonerated. Perez's plea bargain confession led to nearly 100 tainted convictions being overturned.
Three officers were arrested and tried. A higher court tossed out the convictions.
Attorney Harland Braun defends police officers, including the ones accused of criminal misconduct in the King and Rampart scandals. He said he believes there might be a grain of truth to Dorner's allegations of a cover-up. He said he thinks that may have been what set Dorner off.
Civil rights leaders, highly vocal in past scandals, have held back on criticizing the LAPD this time. Instead, they are urging Dorner to surrender peacefully.
Related: Timeline of events
Dorner wrote in his manifesto that he was forced to turn to violence because the culture of racism, brutality, corruption and cover-up continues at the LAPD. He claims he was kicked off the force after he complained about a training officer kicking a mentally ill suspect.
Braun said he had never heard of a case in which the LAPD fired an officer who reported excessive force. "You don't go after the guy," he said. Usually, though, other officers are quick to close ranks and shun a perceived "rat."
He told the story of an officer who testified at the King trial as an expert on the use of force. The man said he believed the officers had, indeed, employed excessive force. His photo was tacked up at the police academy, and it became tradition for any officer who passed by to spit on it, Braun said.
"They've changed enormously, but you're still going to have pockets of this," he added. "You're still going to have individuals who are throwbacks. You're still going to have the culture of cover-up. A group that's fighting together and under siege, they're going to stick together."
Dorner demanded justice and an apology, and vowed that police blood will flow until he gets them. The manifesto names some 40 people he claims have wronged him. He wrote that he does not expect to survive his vengeful rampage.
Last weekend, a couple was found shot to death in Irvine, a suburban Orange County community south of Los Angeles that is home to a college campus. Investigators tied the slayings to Dorner; his manifesto seems to confirm the connection: It says the slain woman's father represented Dorner, unsuccessfully, at a hearing before an LAPD disciplinary committee in 2008.
So far, the bloodshed seems to be taking place outside the city limits. It covers a wide area around Los Angeles, with incidents reported from San Diego in the south to the mountain resort of Big Bear in the east. Three Riverside police officers were shot, one fatally, by a man police say was Dorner.
His beef might be with the LAPD, but no one in law enforcement can feel safe while he is on the run.
Alleged cop-killer's manifesto details threats
Others have threatened to target LAPD cops in the past -- gang members, for the most part. But Dorner is no gang-banger. He's a veteran trained to kill by the military and by his one-time employer, the police.
He threatens payback by violent, unconventional means: "This is my last resort. The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now led to deadly consequences," he wrote.
Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck dismissed the allegations in Dorner's manifesto. "You're talking about a homicide suspect who has committed atrocious crimes," he said, adding that he was not inclined to give credence to his "ramblings on the Internet." As for any apology, well, Dorner shouldn't hold his breath, Beck said.
People who have invested years watching the LAPD -- including attorneys, legal analysts and the Los Angeles Times reporters who have covered the department -- say it has indeed changed since the early 1990s. But they also agree that its past is fertile territory for anyone with a grudge against the department.
Times editor-at-large Jim Newton covered the LAPD as it struggled with the fallout from the King beating and the years of study, oversight and reform that followed. He was the paper's lead reporter during the O.J. Simpson murder trial, when the defense put the LAPD on trial and Simpson was acquitted.
Dorner's manifesto "doesn't reflect any larger cultural truth about LAPD," Newton wrote in an e-mail.
Andrew Blankstein, the paper's current LAPD reporter, agreed. "Every organization is going to have rogues," he said. "But what can you believe from somebody who is homicidal? Obviously, anybody with grievances has a long, well-publicized history of the LAPD to pick at."
Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, has watched the LAPD and its high-profile controversies during the era that includes King, Simpson and Rampart. She also believes the LAPD has changed, even if it is not perfect.
"The LAPD has come a long way, but it still has its detractors," she wrote in an e-mail. "Ironically, the person who is most set on destroying it is one of their own. The Rodney King and Rampart scandals brought to light racism and corruption that had existed in the department. It is easy for someone with their own vendetta against the department to tap into these past episodes and make the LAPD a target."
Opinion: In rampages, it's about revenge
But, she added, the tactic is likely to backfire.
"In the end," Levenson said, "he is probably just creating more sympathy and support for the people he loathes."
CNN's Ann O'Neill covered the Rampart police corruption trial in 2000 as a reporter for The Los Angeles Times.

Hannity-Ellison dust-up shows our broken politics
By Howard Kurtz, CNN
updated 5:12 PM EST, Fri March 1, 2013
Sean Hannity was doing his job in an interview with Rep. Keith Ellison that ended in a shouting match, Howard Kurtz says.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Howard Kurtz: Sean Hannity-Keith Ellison dust-up made for good TV
He says Fox host was just doing interview, and Ellison picked fight on spending cuts
He says escalation, name-calling a sad reflection of coarsened political discourse
Kurtz: Each man may have stood his ground on principle, but viewers lost out
Editor's note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN's "Reliable Sources" and is Newsweek's Washington bureau chief. He is also a contributor to the website Daily Download.
(CNN) -- When I saw the headlines about Sean Hannity getting into a shouting match with a Democratic congressman this week, I assumed the combative and conservative Fox News host had just gone off on him.
I was wrong.
Hannity was trying to conduct what we in journalism call an interview. But from the first words out of his mouth, Rep. Keith Ellison came prepared to pick a fight.
Howard Kurtz
It was good television, I suppose, but it's hard to say it was enlightening.
Ellison began insulting Hannity from the get-go, Hannity pushed back, and the pugilistics were under way.
After I criticized Ellison in an online video, Fox-bashers, Hannity-haters and others started with the nasty tweets.
But it was Ellison, not Hannity, who had started throwing verbal punches. Said one tweet: "Even psychotic liberal Howard Kurtz thinks Keith Ellison was out of line with Sean Hannity." (For the record, I consider myself reasonably sane.)

Go look at the video and decide for yourself.
I've never been shy about criticizing Hannity for mangling the facts or spouting the GOP's talking points. But in this case, he wasn't at fault. This wasn't a situation where both sides were engaged in an argument that grew more heated.
Watch: Why media are savaging Marissa Mayer over Yahoo work policy
Why would the Minnesota lawmaker launch a premeditated assault? Perhaps it's good politics for a liberal Democrat to force a confrontation with Hannity. He can brag to his base about beating up on one of Fox's most popular pundits. In fact, at least one liberal group is already trying to raise money off the incident -- another example of how unbridled partisanship can be profitable.
Ellison told me: "I stood up to Sean Hannity because of what the sequester will mean for millions of Americans who have already been forced to work harder while they get by with less. If these devastating cuts in the sequester go into effect at the end of this week, three-quarters of a million jobs will be lost. ...
"I have constituents in Minnesota who will lose their jobs because Republicans in Congress are unwilling to close loopholes for yacht owners. The president is not being an 'alarmist in chief' or 'President Panic' when he talks about these cuts; he is leading."
Watch: Why Sean Hannity wasn't a 'yellow journalist' in face-off with congressman
A person close to Ellison, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, told me that the congressman allowed Hannity to get under his skin because he felt the host had taken President Barack Obama's words out of context.
Here's how it got going: Hannity had played a series of brief clips of Obama and began with this highly partisan comment: "If and when the Obama sequester takes effect on Friday, it's because the president is more concerned with fear-mongering than finding a solution to the problem that he himself created."
No sooner did he tell Ellison, "Welcome back, sir," than the congressman took, shall we say, vigorous issue with Hannity's opening.
"Quite frankly, you are the worst excuse for a journalist I've ever seen," said Ellison, who then accused him of "yellow journalism." Hannity's not a journalist, he's a commentator paid for his conservative opinions, but let's not quibble.
Ellison was getting revved up again when Hannity tried to make a factual point.
"What the president said was dead-on accurate, and for you to say the president is to blame here is ridiculous. I was there August 2011 when the Republicans, your party, which you shamelessly. ..."
Watch: Did White House e-mail really threaten Bob Woodward?
Hannity interrupted: "I'm not a Republican, let me correct the record."
"You are nothing but a Republican," Ellison said.
Hannity got out that he is a conservative, not a registered Republican, whereupon Ellison accused him of being "a shill for the Republican Party."
Hannity -- who does carry the party's water most of the time -- allowed Ellison to go on for a couple of minutes. Then he tried to ask a question and the congressman repeatedly talked over him. That is pretty much how it went for the rest of the segment, with Ellison at one point calling Hannity "immoral." Ellison accepted the invitation to come on and then showed more interest in name-calling than having a dialogue.
Watch: Overreaction? Conservatives rip Michelle Obama's Oscars moment
The shout fest was, perhaps, a microcosm of what's become of our media and political dialogue. There is so much noise in Washington that those who want to break through sometimes feel compelled to keep boosting the decibel level. Debate is reduced to each side yelling at each other rather than engaging on the issues.
How different was the Hannity/Ellison clash than House Speaker John Boehner telling the Senate to "get off their ass" and pass a budget? Obama and the Republicans have kept hurling accusations of bad faith at one another until the automatic budget cuts that both sides once deemed unthinkable loomed. The thinking seems to be: If there's no possibility of compromise, why not just take potshots and try to win the news cycle?
Most cable news anchors and political players don't descend to that level. But can anyone deny that the media have contributed to a coarsening of the political culture?
Hannity, who finds new reasons to attack Obama every day, is hardly the poster boy for bipartisanship. But in this instance he did invite a politician with liberal views and attempt to be civil.

Teaching kids to cope on the ball field
By Julie Christie, Parenting.com
updated 2:27 PM EDT, Tue May 7, 2013
Parents are key to cultivating a young athlete's ability to cope when the game doesn't go his way.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Soccer referee Ricardo Portillo died after being assaulted on the field
Julie Christie's father refereed and coached her as a young fiery athlete
Christie recognizes her own perfectionism and temper in her daughter
A sports psychologist says parents must mirror good behaviors for children
(Parenting.com) -- It wasn't until soccer referee Ricardo Portillo died that I started to really think about what happened there, and not just because I grew up on the field myself.
Like Portillo, my father was a volunteer referee. He was my coach for years in the town league. When I grew up and moved on, he missed those days of camaraderie and competition. He missed supporting kids and being a part of their development, teaching them to love the game, to deal appropriately with the highs and the lows. So, when I no longer provided even a sideline to invest in, he volunteered.
I was happy he was getting involved. He knew the game, and kids, so well by then. I cannot imagine it being the death of him like it was for Portillo who died Saturday night, a week after a punch from a 17-year-old player put him in a coma in the Salt Lake City suburb of Taylorsville. Portillo was issuing a yellow card -- a warning card, not an expulsion card - against the player who had been arguing with him. That player punched him in the side of the head, causing serious injury. While the cause of death has yet to be officially confirmed, Portillo never woke up from the resulting coma.
The secret risk of youth sports Ricardo Portillo, Utah soccer referee who died after being punched by a player on the field.
I've been in adult coed games where I feared for somebody's well being off the field. It was scary (and annoying, quite frankly, because it disrupted play while we all sat around watching someone get calmed down). But, as a lifetime athlete, I'm also kind of familiar with that aggression, granted on a much smaller scale, and I see the seeds of it in my children.
If genetics are anything, my husband and I have blessed our daughters with natural athletic ability and cursed them with an unnatural intensity and self-criticism. My husband threw racquets. I hyperventilated and sulked and once even stomped off a field yelling obscenities at my coach.

Soccer ref's daughter: 'He took my daddy'
We watch our older daughter, Avina, who is 3 1/2, and joke about how she's doomed to be like us, but really, we're both concerned. Like any kid, Avina wants us to watch every chassé, every somersault, and if she can't do something, she almost immediately yells "I can't do it!" then throws whatever's in her hand and marches off. So young, and already her above average coordination is mixing poorly with a need for perfection.
5 anger management tips for children
That's what Dr. Patrick Cohn, a youth sports psychologist in Orlando and founder of youthsportspsychology.com, calls it -- perfectionism. It's that self-criticism so common to athletes that can intensify in the teen years, because, well, they're adolescents. "Perfectionists have a difficult time with making mistakes," Cohn said, when asked how to cultivate resilience on the sports field. "We help these athletes manage their high expectations about performance and to react better to mistakes.
"Many children link their self-esteem with their performance. If they perform badly, their self-esteem suffers. It's important for parents to help their kids separate their self-worth from achievement in sports."
Cohn specializes in how mental attitudes shape performance and works with professional teams, athletes, parents, even corporations, on how to develop that attitude.
How to prevent sports injuries in kids Not only is this strength, this ability to cope with adversity, with challenge, an excellent life skill, it's also, as we see more and more these days, about safety. A competitive sport inherently involves some aggression; how do we know when a kid is crossing a line? How do we prevent or police the transition from competitive to dangerously aggressive?
"Sports itself requires athletes to assert themselves against an opponent, such as to obtain possession of a soccer ball or basketball," Cohn said. "But athletes cross the line between assertive behavior and aggressive behavior when they break the rules in sports or intentionally try to harm other athletes, coaches, or referees."
And this is more likely to happen when athletes become frustrated or angry. So, if we teach them to deal with frustration and anger, we can help prevent violence, of any scale, on the field.
My outbursts were minimal when I was younger, when my father was an active part of my game experience. He was known for how level headed and fair he was. And this rubbed off on all of us. Granted, later, when I became more independent and my parents were less involved, my temper flared. Maybe I was missing other role models. I'm sure I was tying my self-worth to my game. Certainly, when I had a supportive coach, I acted out less.
Parents are key to cultivating this capability, but, Cohn says, everybody is responsible for modeling as well as actively making a healthy attitude happen -- parents, coaches, even the leagues, which should set up bylaws, outlining acceptable behavior, and then enforce those rules. "And the parents can't be afraid to report bullying or bad behavior. Athletes, as well, should look out for their teammates," Cohn notes.
Why I told my daughter she sucks at sports According to his daughter, Johana Portillo, her father was a ref because he was passionate about the game. "He loved soccer," she told CNN. "We just never thought this was going to happen. He loved what he did and it was his passion."
As an adult, when I was somehow completely free of social and personal pressure, I would often sit in my car after a soccer game, removing my muddy cleats, reflecting on how truly joyous it is to play just for the love of it. I want my children to feel that from the start, free from violent disruptions, both internal and external.
Because there is no role model more powerful than a parent, and no better way to take back our ball fields than raising kids with composure, here are more tools for parents on how to raise real athletes, on and off the field.
Tools for Parents
Dr. Cohn created a pre- and post-game checklist to help parents encourage balance and positivity in their child's athletic experience. Some of the to-dos will be more challenging than others. In general, the message is: stay positive, calm, neutral, and leave the game on the field. This will help your child keep his sense of self-worth separate from performance and help him trust his coach and the officials.
5 Pre-game To-Dos
1. Help your child or teen feel confident about today's game or competition. If you discuss the game, remember to be positive about your athlete's past experiences and successes. Don't point out mistakes or losses. Stay away from the subject of avoiding mistakes from previous games. Say, "Have fun! I know you'll do your best!"
2. Leave the coaching to the coach. Show that you support the coach's decisions. Don't talk about how you'd like the coach to manage the team or how you disagree with some of his decisions. This will undermine your athletes' confidence and trust. They need to enter the game trusting their coaches.
3. Keep your emotions in check. Be a good role model for composure. If you show that you're jittery, nervous, or worried about the game or competition, your child or teen will likely be affected by these feelings.
4. Be a good fan. Be composed on the sidelines before the game. Demonstrate your trust in the coach, the players, and the referees. Don't express your feelings about who should play, or how the coach should play the kids, or how you view a particular ref. Be only positive and supportive. Find ways to support the team—by bringing water or snacks, for example, or serving as scorekeeper if the team needs a parent to do this.
5. Avoid prolonged discussions about your athlete's technique or mechanics before the game. Practice time is over. Just before a game, athletes need to believe in what they've learned and trust in their abilities. If you focus too much on mechanics and technique, they may freeze up. It may be difficult for them to play freely and with trust in their abilities. Avoid saying things like, "Remember the Square Drill and be sure to kick with the side of your foot instead of your toe." Say instead, "Go for it! Have a blast."

5 Post-Game To-Dos
1. Start by making two positive comments about your son or daughter's game. Pick out two simple areas you can complement your son or daughter about. For example, "You really hit the ball great off the tee today and made a great comeback after a slow start." You are more likely to get your player's attention by starting with a couple of positive comments.
2. Ask your player, "What are two things you did well today?" Discuss these first no matter how well or poorly your child played.
3. Be mindful of the subtle rewards or punishment you may unknowingly or knowingly give your player after the game. For example, showing excitement and enthusiasm (for good play) is a reward for your child. Withdrawing attention or being silent (after a bad performance) is a form of punishment for your child.
4. Avoid dwelling on numbers, scores, or position in the event after the game or performance. Discuss statistics only if necessary to make a point. Perfectionists are too obsessed about statistics already, which does not help them maintain a process focus during performance.
5. Leave sports on the playing field! Avoid discussing the game at home and help your child shift gears into other roles in life. Do not go over the play by play unless your child asks. Focus on developing balance in life rather than being 24/7 sports.

Warning signs parents can't ignore
By Ashley Hayes, CNN
updated 4:47 PM EST, Tue November 19, 2013
Young adulthood is typically when symptoms of mental illness or psychosis surface, experts say.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
There is hope for parents with a mentally ill child
Warning signs include anger, depression, withdrawal
Substance abuse can exacerbate symptoms and paranoia
(CNN) -- A state senator stabbed, his son dead from a gunshot wound.
A tragedy, to be sure. But for many parents of children struggling with mental illness -- a wrenching experience in itself -- it can be a truly chilling scenario.
Virginia State Police on Tuesday said Sen. Creigh Deeds was stabbed after an altercation with his 24-year-old son, Austin "Gus" Deeds. The younger man then shot himself, authorities said.
Austin Deeds withdrew from The College of William & Mary last month after being enrolled off and on since 2007, according to a statement from the school.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that he had received a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order on Monday, but was released because no psychiatric bed could be found in the area.
The vast majority of young adults with mental health issues do not become violent, although young adulthood is typically when symptoms of mental illness, including schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, surface, experts say.
Warning signs from a troubled mind: What parents should do
However, parents and others can be on the lookout for warning signs of violence.
It can be difficult to predict, said Daniel Davis, a forensic psychologist in private practice in Columbus, Ohio.
But "over the past 20 years, perhaps especially the past 10, we've gotten a lot better at being able to pick up what would be risk factors for aggressive and violent behavior in youth," he said.
Some of those red flags might include:
Increased anger, suicidal thoughts
A young adult might be increasingly angry or talk of suicide, Davis said, making statements such as "the world would be better off without him" or that his life doesn't matter.
They may develop an increasing fascination with violence or aggression, and may show contempt for others.
Moodiness, depression, substance abuse
Adults may isolate themselves and withdraw from friends and peers, experts said. Their school or work performance may decline and they may become paranoid. They may begin abusing alcohol or drugs, or their use may increase.
A sign of a psychotic disorder may be the development of seemingly odd interests and beliefs -- in UFOs, for instance, or predicting the future, according to CNN mental health expert Dr. Charles Raison.
"It is not necessarily predictive of aggression, but these are all things that should not be ignored and should be responded to," Davis said.
Warning signs of mass violence: What to do
Physical changes
A person may lose sleep because of brain chemistry changes, Dennis Embry, president and senior scientist at the Paxis Institute in Tucson, Arizona, told CNN in 2011.
In the case of psychosis, their appearance may actually change and become stranger and disturbing, according to Raison.
Any of these factors are more concerning, said Davis, if a person has a history of aggressive behavior or substance abuse -- and if they have access to weapons.
"Typically, the rate of violence among the mentally ill is actually lower than the general population," he said, but substance abuse can exacerbate existing symptoms such as paranoia, isolation or impulsiveness.
What to do?
There is hope, experts said.
"We have good evidence-based treatments for these sorts of issues," Davis said. Those might include cognitive behavioral therapy, substance abuse treatment or medication.
Parents or friends can attempt to discuss problems or symptoms matter-of-factly with a young adult. If they are unwilling to seek help, "consult a mental health professional yourself to see if they have suggestions" or specific guidelines for actions you can take, Davis said.
Reach out to a mental health center or your primary care doctor. If the child is in college, consult the college's counseling center. Groups like the National Alliance on Mental Illness may be able to provide referrals.
Although state laws vary -- and beds are scarce, as seen in Deeds' case -- people can usually be hospitalized against their will if there is clear evidence they intend to commit violence.
"In my experience, such hospitalizations can often short-circuit the danger and get people into much-needed treatment," Raison wrote. "Of course, this is not always the case. But it is the best we can do, and it is a lot better than nothing."
