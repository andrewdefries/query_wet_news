BP says Halliburton 'intentionally destroyed evidence' after Gulf oil spill
By Vivian Kuo, CNN
updated 5:26 AM EST, Tue December 6, 2011
Fire boats battle a fire at the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon on April 21, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Halliburton was a contractor for BP at the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon oil drilling operation
BP and its contractors have been locked in legal battles since last year
An explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 and injured 16
The explosion led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the Gulf of Mexico
(CNN) -- BP is accusing Halliburton of having "intentionally destroyed evidence" related to the explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico that led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
The accusation comes in court papers filed by BP Monday in federal court in New Orleans as part of a lawsuit aimed at having sanctions imposed on Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which was a contractor for BP on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. An explosion on the rig on April 20, 2010, killed 11 people working on the rig and injured 16 others. The explosion led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the Gulf.
BP alleges in its filing that Halliburton destroyed evidence on cement testing and violated court orders by not bringing forth "inexplicably missing" computer modeling results.
"Halliburton has steadfastly refused to provide these critical testing and modeling results in discovery. Halliburton's refusal has been unwavering, despite repeated BP discovery requests and a specific order from this Court," the documents state.
"BP has now learned the reason for Halliburton's intransigence -- Halliburton destroyed the results of physical slurry testing, and it has, at best, lost the computer modeling outputs that showed no channeling. More egregious still, Halliburton intentionally destroyed the evidence related to its nonprivileged cement testing, in part because it wanted to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial," the BP papers say.
Is Gulf seafood unsafe to eat?
When reached for comment Monday, Halliburton spokeswoman Beverly Stafford said the company was reviewing the details of the motion.
"However, we believe that the conclusions that BP is asking the court to draw is without merit and we look forward to contesting their motion in court."
The BP documents state that two Halliburton employees testified under oath about destroying notes and samples related to analyzing the stability of a similar cement mixture that was used in the failed oil well.
"[D]id you take down any notes about the slurry?" Halliburton Global Advisor in Gulf Cementing Rickey Morgan was asked during a deposition detailed in the court motion.
"No, ma'am," Morgan responded.
"You didn't take any pictures?"
"No, ma'am."
"And then you said you dumped out the sample?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"And you mentioned that the reason that you didn't document the test and you threw out the sample was because you were worried about it being misinterpreted in the litigation?"
"Yes, that's part of the reason, yes, ma'am," Morgan testified, according to the BP papers.
BP is seeking to have a "third-party specialist" examine a Halliburton computer, saying "such an examination might well recover the missing modeling results, or shed light on the circumstances of their apparent disappearance."
BP and its two contractors -- Halliburton and Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig where the explosion occurred -- have been locked in legal battles since last year.
In September, the final federal report on the spill said BP, Transocean and Halliburton all share responsibility for the deadly explosion and ensuing oil spill.
The three companies "violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations," according to the report, which was issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement.
The report concluded that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the well site.
"The precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known," the report stated. But the disaster was "the result of poor risk management, last minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling" at the site.
BP was "ultimately responsible" for operations at the site "in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment," the report concluded.
But Transocean, as owner of the rig, also was "responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel onboard."
Meanwhile, Halliburton -- as a BP contractor -- was "responsible for conducting the cement job, and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well," the report said.
A spokesman for BP said in September that the company agreed with report's conclusion.
"The Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton," Scott Dean said. "BP (has) acknowledged its role in the accident and has taken concrete steps to further enhance safety. ... We continue to encourage other parties to acknowledge their roles in the accident and make changes to help prevent similar accidents in the future."
But in response to the report, Halliburton continued to deny any responsibility for the tragedy.
The report "incorrectly attributes the operation decisions to Halliburton," said Zelma Branch, a Halliburton spokeswoman. "Every contributing cause where Halliburton is named, the operational responsibility lies solely with BP. Halliburton remains confident that all the work we performed with respect to the ... well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions."
Besides the oil, hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water. At the peak of the crisis, in June 2010, 37% of Gulf waters -- a total of 88,522 square miles -- were closed to fishing due to contamination.

Voting challenges in battleground states could create drama, headaches
By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer updated 5:56 PM EST, Tue November 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Provisional balloting, absentee balloting, and voting technology watched closely
Impact of Hurricane Sandy on polling places, electronic balloting also a concern
Discrepancies like address or name changes could complicate process in close election
CNN is covering Election Day right now on CNN TV, CNN.com and via CNN's mobile apps. Check up-to-the-minute results at cnn.com/results and join our live blog at cnn.com/conversation. Need other reasons to spend Election Day with CNN? Here's our list.
(CNN) -- Theodore Olson says he is not going anywhere after Election Day.
"I've been clearing my calendar just in case I need to be ready for the next five weeks," the Washington "super lawyer" and Romney adviser joked with CNN recently. "I don't know, no one knows, you read these polls and it could come out any of a zillion different ways."
Olson was the appellate attorney who successfully argued before the Supreme Court in the 2000 Florida ballot recount case, which handed the presidency to George W. Bush.
That five-week national drama remains fresh in the minds of political and legal experts, anticipating a possible repeat-- an election crisis in one or more battleground states on pre- and post-election issues.
Romney, Obama make final push for votes
Black churches vote early in Ohio Psaki: 'Confident' voters will vote
Magic electoral vote number to win: 270
"Between provisional balloting, absentee balloting, and voting technology, I think there are untold different ways that this is a tense, contested election," said Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School. "It's pretty certain there's going to be some litigation when this is over on November 6th."
Opinion: America's voting system is a disgrace The voting wars are already being contested on broad canvas -- legislative initiatives, grassroots anti-suppression monitoring, social media campaigns, and months long court litigation.
Here are some potential voting issues and scenarios, based on reporting and research across CNN's various political platforms:
Voter identification and provisional ballots
The greatest source of contention and concern involves laws requiring some form of government-issued picture identification to register to vote and to cast ballots.
Eleven states have new laws in place, designed say supporters to stop fraud, purge voter rolls of outdated information, and restore confidence in the electoral process.
But critics-- led by a coalition of civil rights and other organizations say voter identification is an effort by some politicians -- through the legislature -- to disenfranchise certain voting groups, especially minorities.
How pervasive is any voter fraud? A recent investigation by CNN Justice Correspondent Joe Johns found 55 cases of voter fraud referred for prosecution by the Florida Secretary of State out of 11.6 million registered voters over five years, the latest period for which data is available.
"It's true that there is some voter fraud in this country," Richard Hasen a political science and law professor at the University of California-Irvine told CNN. "But there is no credible evidence that there is any systematic in-person voter fraud. It's not a serious problem."
Politics: Could close race produce a popular/electoral vote split?
According to the Brennan Center for Justice, a legal liberal think tank at the New York University School of Law that has criticized the increase in what it sees as prohibitive voting laws, there have been 25 laws and two executive actions passed in 19 states since the beginning of 2011 which "could make it harder to vote."
But federal courts in recent weeks have, for the most part, limited the reach of these laws: blocking Texas' tough requirements; delaying implementation of Pennsylvania's laws until after November; and eliminating some voter registration requirements in Florida.
Ohio, which analysts say could be the key battleground state, has had many of its Republican-led legislative efforts thwarted. Federal and state courts have expanded early voting to everyone in the crucial last days before Tuesday.
Belief: Your take on polling places in churches
And courts have ordered the state to preserve the provisional votes of those who may have cast in error because of poll worker misinformation -- such as sending someone to the wrong polling place and precinct to cast the ballot.
The state has among the highest provisional ballot rates in the United States - an estimated 200,000 or more were cast in Ohio four years ago. About 40,000 were later declared ineligible. That could delay a final count in the presidential race for days.
Early voting and poll closings
Hurricane Sandy has forced last-minute scrambling among voting officials across the East Coast, where early voting had begun in earnest in several key states.
Politics: Extra day of voting possible in New York
One concern may be whether flooding will cause logistical headaches: a shortage of working voting equipment, or even the disappearance or destruction of thousands of absentee ballots being stored. Some voters may have lost the necessary ID to vote, or have trouble making it to the polls, especially in rural isolated areas.
The Pennsylvania Office of the Secretary of State has advised polling stations to keep paper ballots available at the polls for 20- to 25-percent of expected voters in order to alternate with electronic voting machines.

In Virginia, early in-person absentee voting has been delayed.
"Of course on Monday we had no voting at all. And Tuesday we didn't get started until 10 in the morning," said Tom Parkins, Voter Registrar in Alexandria. "So we lagged behind the 2008 turnout at this point. But, we're reasonably sure that's going to be made up late this week and this weekend."

Like an electoral version of "The Blob," 2012 sample ballots occasionally get out of hand.
Each party has its good-luck superstitions. Republicans rub the trunk of a stuffed elephant, while loyal Democrats feed pictures of the president to a donkey.
Ties! Ties! Get yer all-American red-striped Statue of Liberty ties right here!
The clever Bowzer the Mystery Dog gathers data as voters perform their civic duty.

The rules are different in California.
These votes are about as clean as they come.
Perhaps we should combine polls and laundromats across the country.
No doubt, many voters will also cast their ballot with the "adult emporium" down the road.
Some voters are truly blank slates.

Election 2012: The best photos
Misinformation campaigns
Misinformation of another kind: deliberate efforts to mislead, confuse, or pressure voters. American elections big and small have had such problems before -- but there is no sign it is any more pervasive this election year, based on CNN's interviews with state election officials.
The rise of social media has, in fact, created a misinformation campaign of its own, difficult to sort out fact from rumor, where even a whiff of wrongdoing can feed a wildfire of misplaced outrage and mistrust.
In Florida, another battleground, U.S. Postal Inspectors told CNN they have opened a preliminary investigation into a slew of bogus letters questioning the citizenship and registration of certain voters just two weeks before the election.
Opinion: GOP's push to suppress vote threatens democracy
Other Floridians -- many Republicans -- have said they had received calls from people claiming to represent the state, urging them to vote by phone-- something that is not allowed anywhere.
Some Virginians have received similar complaints.
The liberal ThinkProgress.org group has alleged Mitt Romney's campaign has been training poll watchers in Wisconsin with what it calls "highly misleading-- and sometimes downright false-- information" about voter rights. The campaign denies any such training.
And Wisconsin and Ohio have seen a deluge of billboards popping up with the message "Voter fraud is a felony." That is true, but some see them as clear intimidation, and prompted protests.
"It's the way they are being displayed and the fact that they are in almost exclusively areas or around areas that are predominantly African-American or Latino," said Wisconsin voting rights activist Eric Marshall. "It sends a message to those communities that there's a problem with your voting."
Court challenges
The Secretaries of State typically control elections, and staff members in key battlegrounds contacted by CNN say they are ready to handle any complaints or concerns.
Legal sources with the Obama and Romney campaigns told CNN they were closely watching potential problems, but would not offer specifics on the ground forces the campaigns have deployed, or any specific areas of concern.
New Jersey lets Sandy victims vote via e-mail
Many official complaints-- whether by individual citizens, private advocacy groups, the campaigns, or political parties-- could initially wind up in local courts. State or county judges may be asked to extend poll hours, or allow provisional ballots to be counted. The immediacy and urgency of the request will determine the scope and practicality of any bench ruling.
There has been a public expectation that courts would be the ultimate arbiters of any voting disputes, especially those in a post-election environment. Federal courts in Ohio in recent weeks have ruled against state efforts to limit access to early voting, and by doing so used unusual legal reasoning.
"These two rulings in Ohio could give Obama the edge," Hasen said on his blog. "What the Republican [state] legislatures have taken away, the federal courts, including some Republican judges, have restored, relying in part on the arguments conservative justices endorsed in Bush v. Gore.
The 2000 blockbuster relied on "equal protection" guarantees to dismiss Florida's ballot-counting procedures. It was a rare federal and judicial intervention into broad election administration, a duty the Constitution essentially bestows on the states.
Transparency and voter rolls
A little watched federal court ruling from June could have enormous impact on election related litigation. The 4th Circuit appeals court said the public can now view voter rolls, something only political parties could have previously accessed. That information may include voter history.
The Undecided: Have they made up their minds?
That has prompted groups like True the Vote to launch pre-election challenges to voter rolls in several key states.
The tea party affiliated organization said it is "educating voters, examining the registry, recruiting, training and mobilizing election workers and poll watchers, training how to collect data all along the way, then use the data to shape government action and legislative agendas to support desperately needed election code reform. We are helping stop corruption where it can start-- at the polls."
Some elected leaders worry that greater access could lead to voter suppression. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, wrote to True the Vote, asking for transparency in how the group conducts its business.
Several states -- including Maine and Arizona-- are considering legislation to eliminate or scale back the idea of secret ballots -- a concept that has been in place for decades.
Electoral college questions
Some voters may not realize they do not directly choose a president and vice president. Instead, they are voting to select representatives to the Electoral College, the body that actually determines who will lead the Executive Branch.
The Electors will meet December 17 in their state and vote for president and vice president on separate ballots. In the case of a tie between Romney and Obama, the House of Representatives would meet in January to decide the president, with each state getting one vote. The Senate decides the vice president.
Campaign explorer
The presidential election of 1800 was decided by the House; the confusing 1876 election was ultimately decided by a congressional panel which named the key Electoral College electors; and of course 2000 went to the Supreme Court.
"If the ultimate count in the Electoral College could go either way depending on a particular state," said Olson. "And if the vote in that state is very close, either side might conceivably want a recount and that sort of thing, and we'd be in it all over again. Hopefully not."
If Ohio turns out to be the key state, the nation may have to wait. Provisional ballots can only be counted after Election Day and local election boards are given up to 10 days to determine eligibility. Discrepancies such as recent address or name changes could complicate a process, where every vote is considered in play.

Stepanek the hero as Czech Republic seal Davis Cup glory
updated 3:08 PM EST, Sun November 18, 2012
Radek Stepanek delivered the Czech Republic's first Davis Cup triumph since 1980 by beating Spain's Nicolas Almagro
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Radek Stepanek wins decisive fifth rubber to clinch Davis Cup for Czech Republic
Stepanek beats Almagro 6-4 7-6 3-6 6-3 in front of a jubilant crowd in Prague
David Ferrer had earlier pushed final to a fifth rubber by beating Tomas Berdych
(CNN) -- Radek Stepanek held his nerve to deliver the Czech Republic's first Davis Cup victory in 32 years after defeating Spain's Nicolas Almagro in a dramatic fifth rubber.
World No. 37 Stepanek stunned Alamgro, who is ranked 16 places higher than him, during a tense clash that ended 6-4 7-6 3-6 6-3 in Prague and lasted a little under four hours.
It capped a stellar season for the Czech Republic, whose women won the Fed Cup just two weeks ago. It was their first Davis Cup title since they split from neighboring country Slovakia in 1993.
Stepanek sealed victory after Spain's David Ferrer had pushed the encounter to a fifth rubber by defeating Tomas Berdych in straight sets during Sunday's opening match.

Spirit, fitness and David Ferrer But Almagro couldn't halt Stepanek's charge as the defending champions surrendered their crown.
"It's amazing, we've written history here in our country," Stepanek said in a court side interview. "I cannot describe what I'm feeling right now.
"I came on the court with a mindset that I have to stay calm, hungry, motivated, concentrated, and always know what I'm doing. And that's what I did."
A relieved Berdych was ecstatic at Stepanek's performance after his 6-2 6-3 7-5 defeat to Ferrer earlier in the day.
"There are no words to say. Indescribable. This is the best thing that can be," he said.
Roared on by a vociferous 14,000 strong crowd Stepanek required just one break point to take the opening set 6-4.
Finding himself 4-2 down in the second the 33-year-old rallied to take it to a tiebreak, where he secured a decisive 7-0 victory.
Almagro stepped up a gear in the third set as the Prague crowd echoed the tension emanating from Stepanek.
But the world no. 37 was back on song in the fourth as he obtained the breaks of serve he needed to close out the match and spark wild scenes of celebration inside the arena.

Airport layovers, more pleasure than pain
By Daisy Carrington, for CNN
updated 12:14 AM EST, Wed February 6, 2013
Changi Airport opened their rooftop pool in the 1990s. Delta passengers who want to stay at their gate can order food or Duty Free good from mounted iPads.
Dallas Fort Worth is hoping to become the "healthiest airport in the world". They have a yoga studio, where passengers can strike a pose between flights. Curtis Fentress is overseeing the $1.5 billion modernization of Los Angeles Airport.
Changi Airport also has a complimentary movie theater, which streams films 24/7.
Passengers at Changi can also play games for free in the airport's Entertainment Deck.
Changi was one of the first airports to introduce a free Wi-Fi area. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Increasingly, airports are being defined by their amenities
Golf courses, movie theaters, art galleries can be found at international airports
Passengers at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport can stretch in a yoga studio between flights.
At LaGuardia, Delta have installed restaurants helmed by New York's culinary elite
(CNN) -- Airport layovers can be the most gruesome leg of a journey. But airports are increasingly getting wise to the needs of their passengers, offering a range of amenities from swimming pools to yoga studios and even a golf course.
Last year, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport decided it wanted to become "the healthiest airport in the country, if not the world," according to spokeswoman Cynthia Vega. They started by ensuring every one of their restaurants had a low-fat, "healthy heart" option. Next, they introduced a 700-meter walking path and opened a yoga studio free for passengers to use.
"You know what it's like being trapped in the airport. You can only eat so much food or read so many magazines," says Vega. "There is an inherent stress that goes along with traveling. This is a good way to shake it off."
Increasingly, airports are becoming more and more defined by their amenities. Hong Kong International is known by many golfers for its nine-hole course, visitors to Seoul can take a spin on the ice skating rink at Incheon Airport, while travelers can take in an art exhibit or a classical piano lesson while on layover in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.

For those who travel constantly, airports are the new hometown.Curtis Fentress
Arguably, Singapore's Changi Airport spearheaded the trend back in the mid-1990s, when it introduced a rooftop swimming pool and free internet terminals. In recent years, Changi has continued to innovate, implementing a 24-hour complimentary movie theater, free gaming rooms as well as foot massage and napping stations. Two of their more off-beat recent additions include the world's largest kinetic sculpture and an indoor slide.
"Passengers' demands have changed considerably over the years," notes Ivan Tan, a spokesman for Changi. "The airport is no longer an inconsequential stop along the way, but a destination on its own."
Though the modern airport is often compared to a shopping mall, Curtis Fentress, the architect who designed Incheon Airport and is currently overseeing the $1.5 billion modernization of Los Angeles Airport, finds it would be more accurate to view it as a mini city.
"While it's true there is more shopping than ever in today's airports, there's also more dining, more entertainment, and more culture," he says. "For those who travel constantly, airports are the new hometown."
Delta Airlines have been particularly keen to upgrade the airport experience at their terminals. To date, they've invested $1.2 billion in their new terminal at New York's JFK airport (set to open in May), and $160 million to spruce up their LaGuardia presence.
You know what it's like being trapped in the airport. You can only eat so much food or read so many magazinesCynthia Vega
According to Gail Grimmett, the senior vice president for Delta in New York, their aim is to make traveling more comfortable, but also, to provide a taste of the city beyond the airport walls. To accomplish this, Delta threw out all the fast food outlets that are often de rigueur, and replaced them with restaurants helmed by the New York City culinary elite, including alumni from such notable city venues as Balthazar, Morimoto and the Brooklyn Brewery.
"We wanted to provide a true New York experience," she explains.

The airline has also been a leader in using technology to upgrade the passenger experience. At both their LaGuardia and JFK terminals, Delta has introduced iPads at departure gates and in a handful of restaurants. Passengers can use the devices to read the paper, or order food and retail goods directly to their seats.
"When you walk through the airport, the whole vibe is different," notes Grimmett. "Even on days when it's raining, or flights are delayed, there's such a sense of serenity, because we've given people what they want while their waiting: good food, a comfortable place to sit, and the ability to plug in and do work." Grimmett notes that since adding these features, Delta's customer satisfaction scores "have skyrocketed."
Of course, it was only a matter of time before other airports followed suit. Dallas Fort Worth was one of the first airports to create a mobile app that can help users find a parking space, check out the nearest concessions, and use GPS to map the closest stores and food outlets.
"We're a really user-friendly airport, which is a challenge, given we're huge; we're the size of Manhattan," says Vega.
The upgraded experience is just as beneficial for the airports, whose income is increasingly made up of cash pulled in from retail, food and any other source not directly related to flight. Fentress figures that within a few years, "the majority of airport revenue will be non-aeronautical."

They wouldn't charge for carry-on luggage -- would they?
By Bob Greene, CNN Contributor
updated 11:01 AM EDT, Sun July 14, 2013
Bob Greene says some have talked about adding a carry-on fee, and at least one airline has done it
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bob Greene: Businesses exist to make profit. But would airlines stoop to charging for carry-ons?
At least one small carrier does, he says. Such a business move insults customers
He says Chicago bank once charged $3 to bank with a teller. They had to drop fee
Greene: For exasperated public, "We don't charge you to carry your bag" can seem a bargain
Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story"; "Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights"; and "When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."
(CNN) -- Businesses exist to make a profit.
That's why they're businesses.
But, in their quest to make money, there are certain invisible lines they should be careful about crossing.
Making a profit is one thing. Going over the line and insulting your customers is another.
Bob Greene
It's the kind of thing that can put a business out of business.
Almost every airline has been charging passengers to check bags for quite a while now. When the fees were first instituted, there was considerable grumbling, but travelers have become accustomed to it, even if they still don't much like it.
Executives who run the airlines know that passengers will always flock to a low fare. That's the primary reason the airlines began charging to check bags: Operating an airline is tremendously expensive, and to keep the basic ticket price as low as possible, the revenue had to be made up somewhere. Fees to change reservations, fees for meals, fees for early boarding, fees for pillows and blankets, fees for seats with a little extra legroom. . . .
Reporter Susan Carey of the Wall Street Journal recently wrote that "airlines are likely to keep looking for new ways to nickel-and-dime customers on formerly free items." She quoted George Hobica, an airline industry consumer advocate, as saying that "he wouldn't be shocked if big carriers eventually adopted fees for carry-on luggage."
That's not a typo. Fees for carrying on bags, not checking them.
Now, that could never really happen, right? That's just speculation, isn't it?
But in fact, there is already precedent in the U.S. aviation industry. Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines charges its passengers a fee for their carry-on bags; based on when and where they purchase their tickets, the fee ranges from $25 to $50 per carry-on bag.
On its website, Spirit says that to provide "ultra-low basic fares," it gives its passengers "freedom to choose only the extras they value."
If the price wars continue to escalate, would the major airlines ever dare to tell their passengers that carrying their clothes along with them on a trip is an "extra" feature of flying for which the customers should be expected to pay an additional fee?
Because that's what the choice would come down to. If you buy a ticket and are told that you have to pay more to check your bags, and that if you don't check your bags you also have to pay more to carry them with you, your only alternative, if you object, would be to leave at home any clothes except the ones you are wearing.
That's where the invisible line between trying to make a profit, and insulting your customers, comes in.
More than a decade ago, First Chicago Corp., which became Bank One Corp., decided that it would be a bright idea to charge customers a fee -- $3 -- every time those customers interacted with a teller.

Banks were already charging fees to use ATMs -- people getting cash from the machines were paying a convenience fee.
But then First Chicago instituted the rule that, if customers with less than a certain amount of cash in their accounts went to a teller window, the conversation and transaction with the teller would cost them that $3. Customers with whom I spoke at the time said that even when they were making deposits, they would be charged for handing over their own money.
To some customers, that constituted robbery -- by the banks. There are a few things in this world, even in the world of business, that people should not be expected to pay for. When you walk into a bank, no matter what, dealing with a teller should be free. During the extensive public and media conversation over the issue, I expressed the opinion that any bank that charges any of its customers a penny to interact with a teller doesn't deserve to have any customers.
First Chicago became Bank One, and installed a new top man who had not made the original decision, but had inherited it. He was a fellow by the name of Jamie Dimon, who has, of course, since moved on to bigger things: As chairman, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Dimon is one of the most powerful and influential financial figures in the world.
Back when he was newly at Bank One, he called me, saying he wanted to explain the business rationale for the teller fee. If you should ever unexpectedly receive a phone call from Jamie Dimon, you will immediately recognize (at least I did) that he is smarter than you, that he is 100 % certain that his position is the correct position, and that he is confident that he can persuade you to come around to his side.
But, world-class persuasiveness notwithstanding, in the case of teller fees the policy was destined ultimately to fail, because it crossed that mythical line: It insulted the customers. Two years after that conversation, Bank One announced that it was dropping the fee. One of its top executives told a reporter: "Why have it? I wasn't here when we started it. I really don't understand why we'd have it."
(Yet, as some readers already are thinking, there are banks around the country that have figured out new ways to charge for dealing in person with tellers without using the label "teller fee." It usually shows up on the monthly statement, under some arcane heading. The desire to make that extra buck never seems to end.)
Will you eventually be paying to carry your bag onto a plane? Southwest Airlines has garnered a lot of good will, and a lot of business, by holding out against the movement to charge for checked bags -- Southwest still checks the first two bags for free. JetBlue doesn't charge for the first checked bag. If some major carriers announce that they are instituting a fee for carry-ons, the best counteroffensive will likely come from one or more of their competitors, who may choose to proclaim:
"Come fly with us. We don't charge you to carry your own bag."
For the beleaguered traveling public, that may even sound like a victory.

Surprising celebrity rehab stays
<< Previous Next >>
Probably one of the most-used words in Hollywood -- aside from "scandal" -- is "rehab." It seems nearly every celebrity has sought treatment at one point or another, although the reasons it's needed can vary from mental health to simply "undisclosed." Selena Gomez falls into the latter camp, as her rep has confirmed that the 21-year-old voluntarily packed up for a two-week stay at an Arizona-based rehab center in January. The rep won't say what she needed treatment for, just that it didn't have anything to do with drugs or alcohol. If you're having a hard time buying that, remember scenarios like Gomez's aren't uncommon.
