Popular former governor jumps into Virginia Senate raceStory Highlights NEW: Former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner announces Senate candidacy on Web Democrat left office in 2006 with high approval ratings Republican Sen. John Warner announced retirement from seat after five terms Virginia was once a reliable "red" state, but Democrats have won key races Next Article in Politics » WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, a Democrat, announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate Thursday with a new campaign Web site and a YouTube video. Mark Warner announced his candidacy for the Senate on his Web site Thursday. The site, called MarkWarner2008, features a Web video in which Warner pitches himself as a moderate problem solver willing to work with both Republicans and Democrats -- the same formula that contributed to his popularity as Virginia governor. "I've decided the way I can contribute most to getting our country back on track is to serve in the United State Senate," Warner said in the video. Warner also says he will wait to make a formal announcement until after Virginia's legislative elections in November. The former governor also informed supporters Thursday morning by e-mail about his decision to run for the Senate. In the 2006 midterm elections, Democrat Jim Webb ousted Republican incumbent Sen. George Allen by a margin of fewer than 10,000 votes, or less than half a percentage point. Webb's victory helped give Democrats a 51-49 Senate majority. We could see an equally close contest in Virginia next year. Incumbent Republican Sen. John Warner, no relation to Mark Warner, recently announced that he will retire at the end of his current term, concluding 30 years in office. Don't Miss Sen. Warner decides to retire
Hagel's retirement a blow to GOP
Election Center 2008
National Democratic leaders hope that Mark Warner will be their ticket to taking the seat away from the GOP. Warner's term as governor ended in January 2006, and he left office with high favorable ratings. Warner then flirted with running for the White House. Virginia was once a reliable red state, but Democrats have won three major statewide elections there this decade. "Virginia has been a reliable Republican state since the 1960s with an occasional Democratic breakthrough," said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. "Now those breakthroughs are becoming more frequent." On the Republican side, there could be a bitter primary fight between Rep. Tom Davis, a moderate Republican from northern Virginia, and conservative former Gov. Jim Gilmore. Gilmore dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year. John Warner's retirement makes the GOP's tough task of taking back the Senate next year even tougher. Republican Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Wayne Allard of Colorado have also announced that they are retiring rather than running for re-election. The GOP will could face a serious fight to keep both of those seats in Republican hands. In addition to potentially tough races ahead for them now in Virginia, Nebraska and Colorado, a number of Republican senators up for re-election next year will be fighting for their political lives. The list includes Susan Collins of Maine, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Gordon Smith of Oregon. As of now, only one Democrat up next year, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, appears to be facing a major fight. And it's not only the numbers that are stacking up against the Republicans. "You've got an unpopular war, an unpopular president and an overwhelming desire for change. And in a presidential year, the incumbent president's party defines the status quo," said Schneider. Also hurting Republican candidates are the various scandals and investigations into several of their colleagues. Democrats coined the "culture of corruption" slogan last year as the party successfully wrested control of the House and Senate from Republican hands. They are hoping it works again in 2008. The most recent sex scandal involving Sen. Larry Craig should not hurt the GOP's chances of holding on to that seat in 2008 if the Idaho Republican does indeed resign from office at the end of the month. At the very least, though, the controversy over his arrest in a Minneapolis airport restroom and subsequent guilty plea is not helping his party one bit.

H1N1 : Fighting Swine Flu H1N1 vaccine on schedule, official saysStory HighlightsVaccine makers begin shipping H1N1 nasal spray earlier than expectedNasal spray is recommended for people ages 2 to 49 with no existing health conditionsOfficials expect a slow start as distribution process beginsLiquid doses of the antiviral agent Tamiflu to be delivered in coming weekNext Article in Health » (CNN) -- The rollout of vaccine intended to protect against the global pandemic of H1N1 influenza is continuing on or ahead of schedule, a federal health official told reporters Thursday. The H1N1 vaccine has begun shipping to 21 states and major cities. Vaccine makers began shipping H1N1 nasal spray this week, earlier than health officials had predicted, to 21 states and the cities of Washington; New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Los Angeles, California, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 600,000 doses are expected to arrive at those locations by Tuesday, she said. The first round of deliveries will be the nasal spray, which contains live virus, and is recommended for people ages 2 to 49 with no existing health conditions. In many states, the initial doses of nasal spray will be directed first to health care workers. The spray is not recommended for pregnant women, children younger than age 2 or people with health problems. Some 300,000 liquid doses of the antiviral agent Tamiflu for children were ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and are to be delivered over the coming week, Schuchat said. Texas and Colorado received shipments Thursday, she said. Schuchat urged the public not to be alarmed if expiration dates for some of the liquid Tamiflu have passed, because the Food and Drug Administration extended them "after careful testing" to ensure they are safe and effective.

CDC: Nasal spray flu vaccine
Schuchat asked for patience as the distribution process begins. "We are expecting a slow start," she said. She called the flu's impact on pregnant women "striking," and said obstetricians nationwide have told the agency they "have never seen this kind of thing before." From the time the disease was discovered in April until the end of August, the pandemic, sometimes referred to as swine flu, has killed 28 pregnant women in the United States, she said. Another 100 or so have required hospitalization in intensive-care units, she said. But Schuchat said it is not clear how the impact of H1N1 on pregnant women differs from that of seasonal flu, because the H1N1 outbreak is being more closely monitored than seasonal flu has been in the past. Still, public health officials are certain that flu activity in the United States is more prevalent now than it was at this time of year during previous flu seasons, with "substantial flu illness ... in virtually all states."

Do black tech entrepreneurs face institutional bias?
By Mark Milian, CNN
updated 2:27 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2011 | Filed under: Innovations
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Study: About 1% of tech entrepreneurs who got venture capital in 2010 were black
Some people wonder whether "pattern matching" is hindering racial diversity
Investors use pattern matching to study the traits that helped past ventures succeed
Soledad O'Brien is chronicling the NewMe Accelerator journey in "Black in America: The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley," airing at 8 p.m. ET and 11 p.m. ET November 19 on CNN. Keep the conversation going on CNN's new In America blog.
San Francisco (CNN) -- Wayne Sutton has been asking venture-capital investors and Silicon Valley executives a question that's not often broached here in the epicenter of the technology industry:
"Why aren't there more black people in tech?"
The vast majority of top executives at the leading Silicon Valley tech firms are white men. Women and Asians have made some inroads, but African-American and Latino tech leaders remain a rarity. About 1% of entrepreneurs who received venture capital in the first half of last year are black, according to a study by research firm CB Insights.
This lack of diversity in Silicon Valley made headlines last month when influential tech blogger Michael Arrington, in an interview for CNN's upcoming documentary "Black in America: The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley," said, "I don't know a single black entrepreneur." Arrington later recanted the statement, saying he was caught off guard by the question, but the sensitive issue sparked a public dispute between the newly minted venture capitalist and CNN's Soledad O'Brien.
NewMe co-founder Wayne Sutton, center, works on his laptop at a coffee shop with fellow entrepeneurs.
It's an issue that Sutton, who co-founded the NewMe Accelerator for under-represented minorities in the tech industry and is also building a software company, has been grappling with for months.
NewMe is an incubator program formed to help minorities launch Internet ventures. For two months last summer, Sutton and seven other black entrepreneurs worked together in a rented house in Mountain View, California, where they got advice from successful executives and pitched their startup ideas to investors.
The venture capitalists, including business-software designer Mitch Kapor, told them the struggles of blacks in the tech industry might be attributed to a concept called "pattern matching," which is prevalent in venture-capital circles and yet alien to the rest of the business world.
"Silicon Valley really likes to think of itself as a meritocracy," Kapor said. In fact, "the general state of Silicon Valley is completely backwards," he said.
A true meritocracy?
Pattern matching comes from a computer-science exercise in which a system looks for common attributes within reams of data. Its companion is pattern recognition, a term that some investors use interchangeably but which describes a less precise method.
In the business of investing, pattern matching defines a technique for figuring out which human traits, corporate makeup and financial projections are the foundations for the next Facebook or other big Internet success. The criteria can include a founder's track record, personality type and alma mater, which market the company is targeting and how its peers are performing, and how quickly the business is expected to grow and begin collecting revenue.
Commonly, these successful founders are white computer-science graduates of Stanford University or a similar elite school.
Many of the top venture-capital firms use some form of pattern matching, but no two use precisely the same data sets. The firms typically don't disclose what exactly goes into their formulas because they see their patterns as trade secrets.
But Sutton's NewMe co-founder, Angela Benton, wonders whether pattern matching, which critics say favors the status quo over change, is a veiled form of racism.
"I was offended by it," said Benton, who is also starting a company, in an interview with CNN. "I'm black. I'm a woman. I have kids. I might as well go home."
People familiar with the pattern-matching process say race is not explicitly a factor, nor is gender.
"Most VCs I know pride themselves on the idea that to be a good investor, you have to learn those skills," said Cindy Padnos, who founded a venture capital firm called Illuminate Ventures. Her company says in its creed, "We don't rely on 'pattern recognition.'"
NewMe founders Angela Benton, left, and Wayne Sutton discuss their project.
"I have no doubt that most of what we see happening in the high-tech community is completely unintentional bias, and yet, we all have to recognize (that) unintentional or not, we are all born with it," Padnos said. "Undoubtedly, the unintentional bias comes into play when they look at the 15 (startups) they did (invest in) and the five that succeeded big-time, when the ones that succeeded were led by white males. That somehow seeps into the equation."
Race still a factor?
These methods don't necessarily explain why so few blacks, Latinos and women lead tech companies when compared to the number of white-male execs.
Padnos and her venture firm have researched and advocated for hiring and funding more tech companies led by women. She says she has strived to diversify her 40-person advisory committee and her relatively small investment portfolio, but neither has an African-American.
High-placed female execs like Google's Marissa Mayer and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg have advocated on their own for women, and women continue to break into the top executive ranks. Their recent successes, and the rise of Chinese and Indian tech leaders, could provide a model for other minorities in the United States who are hitting roadblocks in their quests to start Internet companies, industry experts say.
But their hard-earned victories have not come easily.
"We live in a society where race is still a factor," said Rey Ramsey, an African-American man who runs a political lobbying firm for the tech industry called TechNet. Referencing Facebook's famous young founder, he added, "We're waiting for the black Zuckerberg."
A few standout black leaders have emerged in tech over the years, said Charles Moore, an African-American who founded Rocket Lawyer, a startup that offers online legal documents and advice. He cited Frank Greene, a pioneering semiconductor engineer turned venture capitalist who died in 2009, and Charles Phillips Jr., the former Oracle co-president, as inspirations.
"Race has not really been a factor in a material way in my career," said Moore, whose company is backed by Google Ventures, the search giant's venture capital arm. "I think that Silicon Valley is a place where you can work hard and be smart and have some luck, which everybody needs. And if you have those things, you can succeed, regardless of your race or gender or other demographic profile."
Data-driven investing
Google Ventures has extolled the virtues of its data-driven approach to investing, in which it draws patterns from past home runs. For example, the firm has learned, as it told the New York Times in July, that successful entrepreneurs are more likely to create the spark again and that startups located far from the offices of their investors are more likely to succeed.
"Traditionally, the venture business is highly driven by qualitative assessments," said Bill Maris, Google Ventures' managing partner, recently at a conference. "We're trying to also look quantitatively, and apply some data tools and metrics around some questions that make natural sense to us to try and look at."
A longtime venture capitalist, who declined to speak on the record, said pattern matching, when applied correctly, is designed to spot the rare talent that may hit it big, not promote sameness. It has nothing to do with race, he said.
Many of the top venture firms have said publicly that they use pattern matching to identify potentially successful startups. But when contacted by CNN, they were reluctant to talk about it. Spokespeople for several high-profile venture firms, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, did not return requests for comment on this story.
Ben Horowitz, who founded his venture firm with Marc Andreessen, wrote on his blog last year that he understands the value of pattern matching, which allows investors to "recognize patterns of strategy and behavior that generally work, and patterns that generally fail," although he thinks it has limits.
Sequoia Capital's Michael Moritz has said that age is a factor his firm considers when deciding who to invest in.
New Venture Partners, a New Jersey-based firm with an office in Silicon Valley, uses pattern matching, said partner Daniel Deeney in an interview. But race is not a factor, he said, and several companies New Venture has invested in have black leaders. He said New Venture's investments tend to go into the telecom industry, where AT&T, Lucent and others have fostered corporate diversity programs that have fostered minority-led startups.
A racial divide with no clear explanation
Little research has been done on the topic of race in the tech industry. Some observers, including Ramsey, wonder whether the lack of racial diversity can be blamed on hiring practices at tech juggernauts such as Apple, Facebook and Google, none of which cooperated with a request by CNNMoney for employee diversity statistics.
Seasoned Web entrepreneur Hank Williams, left, talking with NewMe co-founder Angela Benton.
"The tech industry is pretty clubby," said Hank Williams, an African-American entrepreneur in the NewMe program who had success in the Internet boom of the 1990s. "There are really no people of color in Silicon Valley."
Others say the issue could be rooted deep within the black community. The NewMe co-founders said African-American families don't typically encourage business leaders or programmers to pursue interests in tech.
"The African-American community is like, 'Oh, nobody is going to give you money to make a website,'" Sutton said. "It's almost like stupid, or not cool."
Still others, like the founder of Kapor Capital, say risk-aversion within venture capital stifles changes in the demographics of entrepreneurs chosen to be financed.
"African-American candidates are much more likely not to match the pattern," said Kapor, who hosted NewMe's demo day at his office. "To recognize the truth is to accept that the winners at the top did so through a rigged game."
His wife, Freada Kapor Klein, a longtime adviser to tech firms on racial diversity in employment, believes people of different racial or ethnic backgrounds can solve problems with technology that others can't because of perspectives learned during their upbringings. Firms that recognize this, she said, should have an edge on less open-minded rivals.

Basnet named CNN Hero of the Year
By Kyle Almond, CNN
updated 7:45 AM EST, Mon December 3, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Pushpa Basnet is revealed Sunday night as the 2012 CNN Hero of the Year
Basnet supports children in Nepal so they don't have to live behind bars with their parents
For being named Hero of the Year, Basnet receives $250,000 to continue her work
(CNN) -- Pushpa Basnet, a Nepalese woman who supports children so they don't have to live behind bars with their incarcerated parents, was named the 2012 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night.
Nepal is one of the poorest countries, and space is very limited in the few group homes affiliated with the government. So when a parent is incarcerated and no other guardian can be found, children have little choice but to live in prison as well.
Basnet, 29, is determined to give these children another option.
She started a home in Kathmandu where children can receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life. She also runs a day care program for children who are too young to be separated from their parent.
"These children have done nothing wrong. They are simply caught in something they do not understand," Basnet said during "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and honored her and the other top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. "We want to work with the government to bring them all out from of prison. And they deserve a better future."
Basnet talks to Anderson Cooper
Pushpa Basnet, the 2012 CNN Hero of the Year, was shocked to learn that many children in Nepal had no choice but to live with their incarcerated parents behind bars. So she started a day care program for many of these children and opened a home in Kathmandu where dozens of them can live a more normal life.
When Basnet hears about an imprisoned child, she'll visit the prison, even in remote areas of the country, and tell the parent what she can provide. If the parent agrees, Basnet brings the child back to stay with her and her staff at the Butterfly Home in Kathmandu.
Basnet talks to a female prison guard to gain permission to go inside a jail in Kathmandu. Basnet was studying social work in college when she first visited a women's prison and discovered how many children had to live there.
A woman at a prison in the town of Nuwakot cries after sending her child away with Basnet. Basnet wants the children to maintain relationships with their parents, so she often takes them back to visit. Ultimately, the goal is to reunite the families outside prison.
Basnet talks to an inmate in Kathmandu. "Meeting and spending time with the children and the mothers in jail, you realize that Pushpa is their only hope," said photographer Palani Mohan.
Since 2005, Basnet and her staff have assisted more than 140 children, providing housing, education and medical care. "When I started, nobody believed in me," Basnet said. "People thought I was crazy."
"It's not fair for (these) children to live in the prison, because they haven't done anything wrong," Basnet said. "My mission is to make sure no child grows up behind prison walls."
Basnet reads to some of the children at the Butterfly Home in Kathmandu. "I don't ever get a day off, but if I [didn't] have the children around me, it would be hard," she said. "When I'm with them, I'm happy."
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world -- according to UNICEF, 55% of the population lives below the international poverty line -- so it lacks the social safety net that exists in most Western nations.
Children at the Butterfly Home say a prayer before eating lunch. Dozens of children live at the home with Basnet and some of her staff members.
Basnet hands out new clothes to one of the young children she cares for in Kathmandu. The children reciprocate her love by calling her "Mamu," which means "mommy."
"The first thing you notice about Pushpa is her huge smile to welcome you," photographer Mohan said. "She's full of energy. She has this incredibly booming voice that never stops all day, all night."
Basnet applies moisturizer cream to one of the children in Kathmandu.
"This is what I want to do with my life," Basnet said. "It makes me feel (good) when I see that they are happy, but it makes me want to work harder. ... I want to fulfill all their dreams."

Portrait of a Hero: Pushpa Basnet
Best moments from the show
Basnet's acceptance speech
Pushpa Basnet was shocked to learn that children in Nepal were living in prisons with their parents. In 2005, she started a children's center that has provided housing, education and medical care to more than 140 children of incarcerated parents. "I always had a dream to build our own home for these children, and I want to rescue more children who are still in prisons," Basnet said. See more photos of Pushpa Basnet, who was voted CNN Hero of the Year for 2012.
Wanda Butts lost her son in a drowning accident six years ago. In his memory, she started the Josh Project, a nonprofit that taught nearly 1,200 children -- most of them minorities -- how to swim. "I started the Josh Project to keep other mothers from having to suffer such unforgettable loss," she said. See more photos of Wanda Butts
Mary Cortani is a former Army dog trainer who started Operation Freedom Paws, a nonprofit that helps war veterans train their own service dogs. Since 2010, she has worked with more than 80 veterans who have invisible wounds such as post-traumatic stress disorder. "I'm hoping this brings awareness to the world that PTSD is real and that we will be able to reach more veterans who so desperately need help," Cortani said. See more photos of Mary Cortani
Catalina Escobar is helping young moms in Colombia, where one in five girls age 15-19 is or has been pregnant. Since 2002, her foundation has provided counseling, education and job training to more than 2,000 teenage mothers. "Teenage pregnancy is a world poverty problem, and we have developed models of intervention that break the cycle," Escobar said. "I want to share it with people around the world." See more photos of Catalina Escobar
Razia Jan is fighting to educate girls in rural Afghanistan, where terrorists will stop at nothing to keep them from learning. She and her team at the Zabuli Education Center are providing a free education to about 350 girls, many of whom wouldn't normally have access to school. "This honor is a God-given gift that will make it possible for me to continue to give a ray of hope to these girls," Jan said. "My goal is to break the cycle of violence." See more photos of Razia Jan
Thulani Madondo struggled as a child growing up in the slums of Kliptown, South Africa. Today, his Kliptown Youth Program provides school uniforms, tutoring, meals and activities to 400 children in the community. "We're trying to give them the sense that everything is possible," he said. See more photos of Thulani Madondo
In memory of his daughter who was killed by a drunken driver in 2007, Leo McCarthy started Mariah's Challenge. The nonprofit gives college scholarships to teenagers who pledge not to drink while they're underage. Nearly $150,000 in scholarship money has been awarded. "We can change an apathetic culture of teenage drinking and driving," McCarthy said. "Hopefully one day soon we will not need Mariah's Challenge." See more photos of Leo McCarthy
Connie Siskowski is helping young people who have to take care of an ill, disabled or aging family member. Since 2006, her nonprofit has provided assistance to more than 550 young caregivers in Palm Beach County, Florida. "I can only believe that when more people understand about this precious population, they, too, will want to recognize and support them," Siskowski said. "These children suffer silently behind closed doors." See more photos of Connie Siskowski
After beating his addiction to drugs and alcohol, Scott Strode found support through sports. Since 2007, his nonprofit, Phoenix Multisport, has provided free athletic activities and a sober support community to more than 6,000 participants in Colorado. "This is an opportunity to shine a light on individual stories of recovery and sobriety in a way that will help remove the shame and stigma that surrounds dependency and addiction," he said. See more photos of Scott Strode
Malya Villard-Appolon is a rape survivor dedicated to supporting victims of sexual violence in Haiti. In 2004, she co-founded KOFAVIV, an organization that has helped more than 4,000 rape survivors find safety, psychological support and/or legal aid. "This encourages me to continue to fight on behalf of women and girls who are victims," she said. "I hope it brings about a change for my country." See more photos of Malya Villard-Appolon

The top 10 Heroes: In their own words
Since 2005, Basnet has helped more than 140 children through her nonprofit, the Early Childhood Development Center.
Basnet was chosen as Hero of the Year through a nine-week public vote held on CNN.com. For being named CNN Hero of the Year, she receives $250,000 to continue her work. That is in addition to the $50,000 that each of the top 10 Heroes are receiving.
When accepting the Hero of the Year award, Basnet relayed a message to incarcerated children in Nepal.
"Mamu's going to take you out from the prison, and you're coming to my place," said Basnet, who is called "Mamu" by many of the children. "This is for my children, and this is for my country Nepal. Thank you so much everybody who voted for me and who believed in my dream."
This is the sixth year of the CNN Heroes campaign. In that time, more than 180 CNN Heroes have been profiled on CNN, chosen from more than 45,000 nominations submitted through the CNN Heroes website.
Each year, the campaign culminates with a live tribute show that brings together some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry.
The celebrities who took part in this year's show included movie stars Susan Sarandon, Adrien Brody, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Harvey Keitel and Josh Duhamel; athletes Jeff Gordon and Cullen Jones; and hip-hop artist 50 Cent. Television stars Rainn Wilson ("The Office"), Rico Rodriguez ("Modern Family"), Jane Lynch ("Glee"), Miranda Cosgrove ("iCarly") and David Spade ("Rules of Engagement") also participated.
There were two musical performances during the show. "American Idol" winner Phillip Phillips performed "Home," and three-time Grammy Award winner Ne-Yo sang "Heroes."

Russia's Putin signs anti-U.S. adoption bill
By CNN Staff
updated 10:03 PM EST, Fri December 28, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Russian lawmaker pushes for exception for children with disabilities
Measure bans the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families effective January 1
Russian leader's action could affect hundreds of American families seeking to adopt
Rights groups criticized the bill, which some say is retaliation for U.S. act against rights abusers
(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law on Friday a measure that bans the adoption the Russian children by U.S. families effective January 1.
The action could affect hundreds of U.S. families seeking to adopt. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures.

Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third-most-popular country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. citizens to adopt.
The U.S. State Department said it "deeply regrets" the law announced by the Kremlin.
"The Russian government's politically motivated decision will reduce adoption possibilities for children who are now under institutional care," it said in a statement. "We are further concerned about statements that adoptions already underway may be stopped and hope that the Russian government would allow those children who have already met and bonded with their future parent to finish the necessary legal procedures so that they can join their families."
The announcement was a wrenching one for Aaron and Jenny Moyer, coming in an adoption process that was well under way for them to become parents of a Russian orphan named Vitali. They carry photographs of them and Vitali together during their visits to Russia.
"He's our son," Aaron Moyer said. "In our hearts, he is our son."
Jenny Moyer says she knows there is an orphan crisis in Russia, especially for children with special needs. Vitali has Down syndrome.
The fact that he has the genetic condition associated with mental retardation may prove to be a help. A Russian parliamentarian, Robert Shlegel, was to submit an amendment that would allow U.S. citizens to adopt Russian children with disabilities, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency.
The couple, who have two biological children and one adopted American child, said they are relying on their faith to see them through the uncertainty.
"We want not just our son, but all the kids over there to have families and to grow up and know the love of a mom and dad," Aaron Moyer said.
iReporter says she's devastated by the news
The Russian measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, Russia's semiofficial RIA-Novosti news agency said.
And it imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights.
The law envisions the drafting of a list of U.S. citizens who will be prohibited from entering Russia, and will suspend the activity of any legal entities controlled by them in the country.
Read more: Russian lawmakers eye adoption ban to U.S.
The vote this week in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house, was unanimous, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov criticized the bill ahead of its signing.
Lawmakers in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, adopted it last week.
The move is widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed on December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia.
The Magnitsky Act is named for Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky died in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death.
The Russian bill's implementation nullifies a recent agreement between the United States and Russia in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions.
Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of adopted Russian children since the 1990s.
The Russian public has supported the bill, with 56% of respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) saying they backed the ban, RIA Novosti reported.
In 2010, an American woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety.
Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special representative for human rights, said Wednesday on Twitter that Russians were "well aware of, and have pointed out more than once, the inadequate protection of adopted Russian children in the U.S." He also said the United States is one of three nations that have not signed the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.
According to the U.N. Children's Fund, the United States is one of two nations -- the other being Somalia -- that has not ratified the convention. But the United States has signed the convention, thereby signaling its intent to ratify.
Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, touted the importance of "inter-country adoption."
"While welcoming Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev's call for the improvement of the child welfare system, UNICEF urges that the current plight of the many Russian children in institutions receives priority attention," he said.
He asked that Russia let children's "best interests" guide the "design and development of all efforts to protect children."
Groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had urged Russian lawmakers to reject the bill.
"This bill hits back at Russia's most vulnerable children and could deprive them of the loving families they desperately need," Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said last week.
John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, has said that "this bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act."
CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Alla Eshchenko, Brian Walker and Samira Said contributed to this report.

(CNN) -- The weekend massacre at an upscale shopping center in Kenya is shining a new light on an old concern for Western counterterrorism officials: the recruitment of jihadist fighters from Somali communities in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
It's a concern all too familiar for many Somali-American families in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where young men have been slipping away to join the al Qaeda-affiliated guerrilla group Al-Shabaab for the past few years, sometimes in groups. Several have died, their relatives learning of their deaths in cryptic phone calls or in messages posted online.
One of those killed was Burhan Hassan, who was killed fighting in Somalia. His uncle, Abdirizak Bihi, told CNN that members of the city's Somali community have been trying to counteract the recruitment efforts.

Musango was one of the victims of the Westgate Mall hostage siege. Kenyan security forces were still combing the mall on the fourth day of the siege by al Qaeda-linked terrorists.

"What we have learned for the last five years is we have to speak out against this," Bihi said.
Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack
In a message on its now-suspended Twitter page, Al-Shabaab named nine people it said were among the gunmen who stormed Nairobi's Westgate Mall on Saturday. Three of them were from the United States and one each was from Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, it said.
"It isn't totally surprising, given the fact that we know Shabaab has recruited in the United States," CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said Sunday. "We also know they have recruited in a number of European countries."
Bergen noted that the group's Twitter page includes tweets in colloquial English, "the kind of English that an American, or perhaps somebody who grew up in the UK, would be using."
Al-Shabaab is fighting to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in Somalia, a struggle in which Kenyan troops have been directly involved since 2011. Kenyan troops wrested control of the key Somali port of Kismayo from the jihadists in 2012, and Somali government and African Union troops drove the group out of its strongholds in the capital Mogadishu in 2011.
Tweets from @cnni/nairobi-attack
As early as 2008, the FBI warned that more than a dozen youths, some of them American citizens, had left Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali population in the United States. At least three are believed to have carried out suicide bombings in Somalia, where an internationally backed interim government has taken tenuous root after two decades of civil war and near-anarchy.
Minneapolis' Somali community "is 100% against terror," said Bihi. But he said a lot of families arrive owing "a lot of debt," and community youth programs were "almost nil." Al-Shabaab recruiters engaged teens by providing them entertainment and role models, then "brainwashed" them, he said.
A senior State Department official told CNN that U.S. officials are trying to confirm whether the names released by Al-Shabaab are Americans, but said they are becoming more confident American citizens were involved in the Kenyan attack. The official said the administration has been concerned and raising alarm bells about Al-Shabaab recruitment in the Somali-American community for years and would be making decisions in coming days about additional efforts to stem the flow of recruits.
How Al-Shabaab picks its targets
In 2010, a federal grand jury charged 14 people in the United States with aiding Al-Shabaab. Two women in Rochester, Minnesota, were convicted of soliciting more than $8,000 for the group under false pretenses, telling contributors the money was for the poor, and received 10- and 20-year prison terms.
The rest of those named in the indictment had already gone overseas, including Omar Al-Hammami, who became something of a jihadist rock star before falling out with the group and dying in a fratricidal ambush in 2012.
Hammami differed from many of the other recruits. He was raised a Baptist in Alabama, but converted to Islam as a young man and created rap-style recruiting videos that bridged American and Somali culture.
Another man, Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed, was sentenced to more than nine years in March after pleading guilty to aiding Al-Shabaab. Ahmed was a native of Eritrea who had been living in Sweden before joining Al-Shabaab, prosecutors said. He was arrested in Nigeria and transferred to New York for prosecution.

Final bow: Actor Joseph Ruskin is dead at 89
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 8:28 PM EST, Wed January 1, 2014
Joseph Ruskin, who appeared in 25 films and 124 television shows, began and ended his acting career on the stage.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ruskin's film credits include "The Magnificent Seven," "Prizzi's Honor," "Indecent Proposal"
His 124 TV roles include "Twilight Zone," "Star Trek," "Mission Impossible" and "Alias"
His last performance was on a Los Angeles stage in 2013 in "The Crucible"
Ruskin was active in two actors' unions and pushed for their merger
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Joseph Ruskin, who acted in 25 films and 124 television shows, died of natural causes in a Santa Monica, California, hospital Saturday, SAG-AFTRA announced Tuesday. Ruskin was 89.
Ruskin's big screen credits included roles in "The Magnificent Seven," "Prizzi's Honor," "Indecent Proposal" and "Smokin' Aces." His TV credits included "Twilight Zone," "Star Trek," "Mission Impossible" and "Alias." He began and ended his acting career on the stage. His first professional performances were at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and the Rochester Arena Stage after he left the U.S. Navy following World War II. His last theater performance came this year as a member of the Antaeus Theatre Company of Los Angeles.
He appeared in the 2012 Antaeus production of "You Can't Take It With You." He took his final bow on stage in 2013 in the company's "The Crucible" production.
"Joe was the epitome of the actor who takes care of all the other actors while keeping one foot firmly planted on the stage or the set," SAG-AFTRA President Ken Howard said. "He gave so much for so long it's hard to believe he's gone."
Ruskin "devoted so much of his time in the 1980s" to the merger of the two actors' unions -- SAG and AFTRA, -- which became a reality in 2012, Howard said.
He served on the Screen Actors Guild board from 1976 through 1999, including eight years as 1st national vice president, the SAG-AFTRA release said. He was the first Western Regional Vice President of Actors Equity Association and served a decade on AFTRA's national board.
Ruskin, whose real name was Joseph Schlafman, was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, but attended high school in Cleveland, Ohio. He joined the Navy in 1942.
He studied drama at Carnegie Tech -- now Carnegie-Mellon University -- after the war, which led to his professional acting career.

February 20, 1954
Patricia Campbell Hearst was born in San Francisco, California. She grew up in wealth and privilege as the daughter of Randolph A. Hearst, chairman of media conglomerate Hearst Corp., and Catherine Hearst, a University of California regent.
February 4, 1974
A radical group called the Symbionese Liberation Army abducted Hearst at gunpoint from her Berkeley apartment near the University of California campus. The SLA kept Hearst locked in a closet for 57 days. Eventually, she joined the SLA, taking the name of Tania.
April 15, 1974
The SLA robbed a bank in San Francisco. Two bystanders were shot. Bank cameras pictured Hearst brandishing a rifle. She later said that she joined in the robbery out of fear for her life.
May 16, 1974
Hearst fired shots outside a Los Angeles sporting goods store to help free an SLA member who had been accused of shoplifting. She and the SLA's William and Emily Harris fled from the scene.
May 17, 1974
Six SLA members died in a shootout with Los Angeles police as their hideway house went up in flames. Hearst and the Harrises watched the conflagration live on television from a motel near Disneyland.
September 18, 1975
The FBI arrested Hearst in San Francisco more than 18 months after her kidnapping.
March 20, 1976
A federal court jury rejected Hearst's defense that the SLA brainwashed her, finding her guilty of the bank robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Hearst was sentenced to seven years in prison.
1979
President Jimmy Carter commuted Hearst's prison sentence after she served nearly two years.
1979
Hearst married Bernard Shaw, a police officer who moonlighted as her bodyguard. The couple have two daughters and live in a Connecticut suburb.
1982
Hearst published "Every Secret Thing," a memoir describing her kidnapping and her ordeal with the SLA.
1990
Hearst made her movie debut in John Waters' "Cry-Baby." She has made several other movies for Waters, including "Serial Mom" (1994), "Pecker" (1998) and "Cecil B. Demented" (2000).
1996
With Cordelia Frances Biddle, Hearst co-authored "Murder at San Simeon," a murder mystery involving her grandfather's famous California estate.
2001
Hearst received one of the last-minute pardons that President Bill Clinton gave before leaving office.
