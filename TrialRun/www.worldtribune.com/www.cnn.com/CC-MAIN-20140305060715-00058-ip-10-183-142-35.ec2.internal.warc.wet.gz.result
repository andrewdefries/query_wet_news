JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Egypt is proposing a Mideast peace conference in October, according to Moshe Debi, an adviser to Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom.The October talks would include Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers, as well as foreign ministers from the "Mideast Quartet" -- the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia, Debi said.The summit agenda is still unclear and no concrete steps have been taken, according to Debi.Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have recently centered around a controversial barrier that Israel is building in and around the West Bank. The U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a Palestinian-backed resolution calling on Israel to dismantle the barrier.Israel says the barrier is needed to prevent terrorist attacks on Israelis. Palestinians charge that it is a land grab.The Palestinian Authority's leadership is also facing an internal power struggle, as the Palestinian parliament is pressuring Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to accept his prime minister's resignation.The two top Palestinian leaders ended up at loggerheads Tuesday when Arafat refused to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei, but Qorei said he would not back down and withdraw his resignation.Qorei turned in his resignation after a corruption scandal, and Arafat's handling of it, prompted thousands of Palestinian demonstrators to march through the streets in Gaza, attacking Palestinian Authority offices and wounding at least 10 people.Qorei said Gaza was in "chaos" and called on Arafat to implement reforms that Qorei has been pushing for months.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

J.K. Rowling pens Harry Potter prequelStory Highlights Author J.K. Rowling pens Harry Potter prequel for charity auction Autographed 800-word piece will raise money for dyslexia charity Previous autographed Rowling pieces have raised millions of dollars Next Article in Entertainment » Read VIDEO LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is writing a prequel to her best-selling series to be auctioned for charity -- but at just 800 words, it may lack some of the magic fans of the boy wizard might be hoping for. Autographed copies of J.K. Rowling's work have fetched millions of dollars at auction. Rowling's hand-written prequel, signed by the author, will be auctioned alongside works by other famous writers to raise cash for a dyslexia charity. Despite the brevity of the piece, experts believe it could fetch big money, since other autographed works by the blockbuster author have sold for millions of dollars. "We never dreamed that J.K. Rowling would donate something so precious, and we're incredibly grateful," said Gerry Johnson, managing director of Waterstone's, the UK book chain organizing the auction. "I can't begin to guess how much it will raise at auction." A previous 93-word storycard from Rowling, which referred to the book "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," sold in 2002 for $53,000. Rowling later produced seven hand-written copies of a new work, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard," one of which sold for $3.9 million in 2007. "Given the enormous interest we have seen in recent times for autograph work by J.K. Rowling, the prospects for her storycard are good to say the least," said Philip Errington, a specialist at Sotheby's auction house, which is helping to organize the sale.

Potter author: I considered suicide
The card on which the story is written -- measuring 14.6 by 20.9 centimeters (5.75 by 8.25 inches) -- is signed "JK Rowling 2008." The author signs off with the message: "From the prequel I am not working on -- but that was fun!" Alongside Rowling, 13 other authors invited to contribute to the June 10 auction include Margaret Atwood, Sebastian Faulks, Nick Hornby, and Tom Stoppard. A book featuring all 13 cards will go on sale in August. All profits from the book will benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN, a writers' association, Waterstone's said.

Turkey blasts French passage of genocide law
By Ivan Watson and Yesim Comert, CNN
updated 9:55 AM EST, Tue January 24, 2012
Members of a pro-government workers union protest outside the French Embassy in Ankara in December.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The French Senate passed a law criminalizing the denial of genocide
Turkey says Muslim Turks were also massacred by Armenian militias
Armenia's foreign minister: "This day will be written in gold"
Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey is reacting angrily Tuesday to the French Senate's approval of a law criminalizing the denial of genocide, including that of the Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire.
"Guillotine to History" and "Guillotine to Thought," blared the front pages of two Turkish newspapers. "He massacred democracy," announced another newspaper, Hurriyet, next to a front-page photo of French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
In the run-up to Monday's late-night vote in the French Senate, the Turkish government made no secret it was vehemently opposed to the French law, warning it could cause permanent harm to Franco-Turkish relations.
The Turkish foreign ministry put out a pre-dawn statement condemning the law Tuesday. Later, however, Turkey's hot-tempered prime minister surprised some observers, when he called for a "period of patience" in a televised speech.
"A mistake was made... history cannot be judged or written by parliaments," said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in remarks before lawmakers from his ruling political party.
France passes Armenian genocide bill
Friction over Armenia genocide issue Denouncing the French law as racist and a "massacre of freedom of thought," Erdogan added, "We have not lost our hope yet that this mistake can be corrected."
The Turkish leader said his government would lobby for a petition of 60 French lawmaker signatures to block the law in France's Constitutional Council.
According to the French legislation, "those who have publicly denied or trivialized crimes of genocide," can face a year in prison and/or a 45,000-euro fine.
The law does not specifically mention the World War I massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turks. But most of the seven-hour debate in the French Senate Monday focused on the memory of the Armenian genocide.
Within minutes of the 127-86 vote in favor of the law in Paris, Armenia's foreign minister issued a statement of gratitude that declared France "a genuine defender of universal human values."
"This day will be written in gold," wrote Edward Nalbandian.
Every year, Armenians around the world commemorate the 1915 slaughter of more than 1.2 million ethnic Armenians.
The Turkish government rejects the term "genocide" to refer to this dark and bloody chapter of history. Many Turkish politicians and historians argue Muslim Turks were also massacred by Armenian militias in the final days of the Ottoman Empire.
Instead, Ankara expends significant political capital and issues threats in an attempt to block initiatives in the U.S. Congress to formally term the killings of Armenians as "genocide." The United Nations defines genocide as the killing of, injuring of, or displacing of members of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy the group.
After the French lower house of parliament passed the genocide law in December, Turkey temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Paris and suspended military ties with France.
Turkish politicians have warned of further sanctions against France if Sarkozy allows the new law to go into effect.
But in an interview with CNN Monday, the head of the Turkish parliament's foreign affairs committee deliberately avoided saying what those measures might be.
"There's always ambiguity in politics and diplomacy," said Volkan Bozkir. "There will be some (measures)... which will hurt France more than Turkey," he warned.
Turkey and France enjoyed more than $14 billion in bilateral trade last year. They are also partners in the NATO military alliance.

Adventurers recreate 'greatest survival story' of the Antarctic
By Jenny Soffel, for CNN
updated 12:50 PM EST, Thu January 31, 2013
Nearly 100 years ago, explorer Ernest Shackleton managed to pull off a legendary Antarctic rescue. Now, a team of devoted adventurers have set sail in an effort to reenact his epic survival journey in a replica lifeboat (pictured).
This original picture from 1916 shows Ernest Shackleton and his five man crew embarking on the 800 nautical mile rescue mission across the Antarctic after losing their ship in the ice.
Ernest Shackleton, pictured, was an Anglo-Irish polar explorer and one of the principal figures of a period in the early 20th century known as the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration". Another original photo shows Shackleton's vast ship Endurance trapped lop-sided in the ice on October 19, 1915.
When Endurance finally sank, Shackleton and his men ended up on the remote and uninhabited Elephant Island having spent two years adrift in the Antarctic. Crew member Frank Hurley documented the whole journey with his camera. This is a photo of one of the sledge dogs, Lupid.
British-Australian adventurer and environmental scientist Tim Jarvis has just embarked on attempt to recreate Shackleton's survival journey using almost exactly the same provisions.
Remaining true to the original journey means that the crew will sleep in reindeer skin sleeping bags, use a sextant for celestial navigation and even drink Shackleton's favored whiskey.
The crew are sailing in an exact replica of the original boat. Here boat-builder Nat Wilson (right) is seen orchestrating the early stages of construction, which took two years to complete.
The replica is called the Alexandra Shackleton, named after Ernest Shackleton's granddaughter. Here the crew is seen testing the waters in Admiralty Bay, on the southern coast of Antarctic King George Island. The trip is in part to honor the centenary of Shackleton's journey, but also to highlight the effect of the climate change on the Antarctic. Expedition leader Tim Jarvis has journeyed across Antarctica before, but thinks this is the hardest challenge yet.
Jarvis and his five crew mates huddle in full 1920s explorer apparel for an appropriately sepia-hued photo taken on their way to Elephant Island. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Adventurers set to re-enact polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's epic journey.
The team will only use equipment and clothes available during early 20th century.
No one has yet managed to replicate Shackleton's entire rescue voyage.
Australian explorer Tim Jarvis will be the expedition leader.
MainSail is CNN's monthly sailing show, exploring the sport of sailing, luxury travel and the latest in design and technology.
(CNN) -- In 1916, British polar explorer Ernest Shackleton managed to save his entire crew after they had been stranded in the Antarctic for almost two years. Now, nearly a century later, Australian explorer Tim Jarvis and his team of five adventurers have set sail Thursday on a voyage to emulate Shackleton's epic survival journey, using almost exactly the same equipment and rations.
During the original, grandly titled "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", Shackleton had attempted to cross the Antarctic and reach the South Pole with a crew of 27 men on his ship, the Endurance.
But, after little more than a month, temperatures dropped so dramatically that the ship froze solid in the ice and eventually sunk. So began the long mission to survive, culminating in what is regarded by many to be one of the most astonishing rescue journeys in history.
After abandoning ship and finding land on the inhospitable and remote Elephant Island, Shackleton set out with just five of his men in a small open lifeboat to seek help for the rest of his crew.
Shackleton's 800 mile journey Shackleton's 800 mile journey Braving 20 meter-high waves, they rowed for two weeks across 800 nautical miles (1,482 kilometers) of icy ocean to the island of South Georgia. There they trekked 32 miles along the island's mountainous interior, eventually securing vital assistance at a manned whaling outpost.
Attempts to repeat Shackleton's rescue mission have been done before, but Jarvis' journey has a special twist. In the name of authenticity, they will reenact the whole thing on a replica of the original lifeboat and use only equipment and rations available in the early 20th century.
"Nobody has managed to do it the way Shackleton did it -- with the same gear and the same boat," said Jarvis, who believes it's the most challenging expedition of his life.
"It's not to be taken lightly," he added.
The only modern adjustments on board are the emergency gear and radios. Apart from that, the crew are facing exactly the same privations as their predecessors -- right down to the handmade reindeer skin sleeping bags, unpalatable but nutritious Pemmican (a concentrated mixture of fat and protein) and Shackleton's favorite whiskey "Whyte & Mackay".
Jarvis and his crew have just left Elephant Island and are now sailing the rough Southern Ocean in their replica of the James Caird, a wooden lifeboat only 6.85 meters (22 feet) long; the size of a typical six-seated mini bus.
They will then attempt the climb using only one small section of rope and a carpenter's adze -- just as Shackleton did.
There is a certain amount of luck involved, as well as the skill of the crew and the preparation of the boatTim Jarvis, explorer

As the centenary of Shackleton's journey approaches, the motivation for this expedition is in large part to honor the great explorer's legacy, even if it means risking life and limb and overcoming some enormous challenges.
"There is a certain amount of luck involved, as well as the skill of the crew and the preparation of the boat," explained Jarvis, in an interview before he left for the Antarctic.
The team's skipper Nick Bubb is concerned about the technical difficulties of operating an antiquated yacht.
"The boat doesn't have a keel, which means it will capsize easily. And since we are relying on celestial navigation, a cloudy sky will make it more difficult knowing where we are," he said.
For the worst case scenario, there is a modern boat trailing them, ready to pick them up if disaster strikes. And, unlike Shackleton and his men, this crew hasn't already spent over 500 days abandoned in the Antarctic.

Polar historian and author Dr Huw Lewis-Jones thinks this reenactment is an excellent way of resussitating interested in the early 20th century period known as the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration".
"We need people like Tim Jarvis to do things like this that bring history alive," Lewis-Jones said. "Anyone who has ever been to the Southern Ocean knows how awesome Shackleton's journey was. It's quite rightly called an epic," he added.

The human will to survive is strong and in Shackleton it found its perfect exponent Huw Lewis-Jones, historian
"The human will to survive is strong and in Shackleton it found its perfect exponent. The man was a legend," Lewis-Jones said.
As an environmental scientist, Jarvis also wants to draw attention to the climate change affecting Antarctica since Shackleton's time, which he attributes to global warming.
Most of all, however, he wishes to honor the spirit of Shackleton's philosophy.
"One of his key messages was the importance of team work," Jarvis said. "We need to all act together in this world today, to overcome our problems."

Don't gut the Voting Rights Act By Penda D. Hair and Benjamin Todd Jealous, Special to CNN updated 7:12 AM EST, Tue February 26, 2013
On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will review the Voting Rights Act of 1965. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will review the Voting Rights Act of 1965
Penda Hair, Benjamin Jealous: Losing Section 5 of the Act would harm our democracy Leading up to the 2012 elections, we saw great efforts to pass restrictive voting laws, they say
Hair, Jealous: Without Section 5 of the Act, unfair voting policies would go unchecked
Editor's note: Penda D. Hair is co-director of Advancement Project, a next generation civil rights organization that focuses on issues of democracy and race. Benjamin Todd Jealous is president and CEO of the NAACP.
(CNN) -- On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will review the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark legislation that cleared barriers to the ballot box for all American citizens.
In Shelby County v. Holder, the Court will hear arguments on Section 5 -- the heart of the Voting Rights Act -- that allows the federal government to block state election practices that are discriminatory. A predominantly white county in Alabama, Shelby County, charges that the decision of Congress in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 is unconstitutional.
The case comes on the heels of a federal election last fall in which our nation witnessed the greatest assault on voting rights in more than a half century. Drastic cuts to early voting hours, restrictive photo ID laws, tens of thousands of registered voters being dropped from poll books due to illegitimate purges were only a few of the tactics used to keep people from voting.
Penda D. Hair
Benjamin Todd Jealous
Desiline Victor, a 102-year-old Miami resident who was invited to join first lady Michelle Obama at the recent State of the Union address, stood in line for more than three hours to cast a ballot. Sadly, thousands of voters had to endure waiting times up to eight hours, prompting President Barack Obama to call for the nation to "fix it."
New laws and policies are being considered on the state and federal level now that will make it harder to vote -- particularly for the elderly, the young and people of color. Without the protections afforded by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, many Americans would find voting even more difficult.
Election Day is the one day where we are all equal. Black, brown or white, rich or poor, we all have an equal say in the ballot box. Voting is the most fundamental pillar of a democracy and it is imperative that we keep elections free, fair and accessible to all.
Opinion: Voting Rights Act and the South on trial
As this important debate begins anew, here are five key misconceptions you need to know about the Voting Rights Act and why it remains as relevant today as the day it was originally signed.

Section 5 unfairly punishes the South for its past
This provision of the Voting Rights Act requires jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to get federal "pre-clearance" (essentially, permission from the Department of Justice) before changing any voting procedure. This applies to not just Southern states, but also to other states such as Alaska, Arizona, along with certain counties in New York, Michigan, South Dakota, New Hampshire and California.
Once a state has demonstrated that it can fairly run elections for a period of 10 years, it can be exempted from Section 5. In fact, every jurisdiction that has sought this "bailout" since 1982 has been approved. The jurisdictions that remain covered by Section 5 have not applied for bailouts. They are not being punished for their past, but held accountable for their present practices.
The formula is outdated
Section 5 is not static, and dozens of jurisdictions have been added under the provision since it was first passed. In fact, Section 5 was reconsidered and reauthorized by Congress in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006 based on extensive evidence of continuing discrimination.
The NAACP, Advancement Project and other civil rights advocates have long pushed for expanding Section 5's "pre-clearance" to include more states with voting problems, such as Ohio and Colorado, and more counties with records of egregious discrimination in voting. Doing so, however, takes Congressional action. So far, Washington's lawmakers have not demonstrated the political will. We should not revoke critical protections for fair voting simply because Congress has failed to act on expanding them.
Section 5 is no longer applicable
The Voting Rights Act was passed not only for the most extreme acts of intimidation, but also for the small changes, such as literacy tests and poll taxes, that made voting harder for people of color and poor whites. The last few years leading up to the 2012 elections saw the greatest efforts to pass restrictive voting laws since the post-Reconstruction era, including limiting the type of ID that people can use, and requiring additional proof of citizenship to register and vote, all of which disproportionately impact people of color and the working poor. These adjustments unfairly shift the goal line and demonstrate why Section 5 is still needed.
Section 2 is sufficient to ensuring fair voting procedures
While Section 2 of the law bans voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity, it is enforced only through lawsuits. When lawsuits are filed, the burden of proof rests with the challenger (not the local or state government that has changed voting rules).
In contrast, Section 5 ensures that discrimination can't take hold by blocking problematic policies from going into effect in the first place. Without these precautions, unfair voting policies would go unchecked, leaving disenfranchised voters to face harm later.
The country reelected an African-American president, with a large share of support from black and Latino voters, so we no longer need their votes to be protected by Section 5
Section 5 made a difference in the 2012 elections. It blocked restrictive photo ID laws in Texas and South Carolina, and was used to reject a Texas redistricting plan that would undercut Latino voting power. And as the U.S. Department of Justice reviews Mississippi's photo ID law, that measure is on hold.
It is against this backdrop that the Supreme Court will hear the challenge to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Losing this provision would signal a green light for even more partisan legislatures to manipulate election laws for political gains.
At a time when voting rights are increasingly under attack, we should be expanding federal oversight of voting laws -- not scrapping the most effective civil rights legislation ever enacted.

5 things we learned from Sanford's win
By Paul Steinhauser and Jim Acosta, CNN
updated 9:15 AM EDT, Wed May 8, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Disgraced former Gov. Mark Sanford overcame past scandals to win House seat
Sanford is a veteran campaigner while opponent Colbert Bush made some rookie mistakes
Surprisingly high turnout in solid Republican district helped Sanford
Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) -- Mark Sanford is heading back to Washington after detours along the Appalachian Trail and Argentina.
The former South Carolina governor finished his second term in office three years ago with his political career dead in the water thanks to a well-publicized extra-marital affair and ethics violations. But he came away Tuesday with a victory over Democratic opponent Elizabeth Colbert Busch in the special election for a vacant House seat in the Palmetto State's 1st Congressional District -- the same seat he once held.
Here's what we've learned, or better yet, re-learned, from Sanford's victory
1. Voters give politicians second chances
Former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, resigned from Congress in 2011 after being embroiled for weeks in a sex scandal linked to his lewd online exchanges with women. Weiner announced in May that he was running for mayor of New York City, saying in a video announcing his campaign, "I hope I get a second chance to work for you." Weiner's comeback bid suffered a potential setback Tuesday, July 23, when he acknowledged more sexually tinged exchanges with an unnamed woman. "What I did was wrong," Weiner said in a statement about the newly emerged communications.
Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after it was revealed that he had spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes, says he plans to run for New York City's comptroller. "I accepted responsibly for what I did," Spitzer said. "I spent five years of working, doing useful things, and I hope the public will offer me an opportunity." Despite taking knocks from the press, the voters and, in some cases, the law, other politicians have pursued redemption in their public image or, in some cases, a return to office.
Former Gov. Mark Sanford endured heavy criticism and being the butt of jokes until his term ended after he admitted in 2009 that his six-day hiking trip on the Appalachian Trail was actually a cover for a trip to Argentina to visit his mistress. In May, Sanford won election against Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch for an open seat in the U.S. House, despite being heavily outspent by Democrats and without the backing of national Republicans.
Bill Clinton had a scandalous presidency, most famously having an affair with an intern that prompted his impeachment. Since, he has become an important figure in worldwide humanitarian efforts and informal adviser to President Obama. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich left his position in disgrace after the Clinton impeachment proceedings in 1998. It was also later revealed that he was having an affair with a Congressional staffer, now his current wife Callista. Gingrich had an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and is now seen as an elder party statesman, regularly appearing in the media on conservative issues.
Before becoming an adviser for Homeland Security, retired Sen. Gary Hart was the front-runner of the 1988 Democratic primaries for president until images of him with a model surfaced, ending his campaign.
Former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, has had many ups and downs in his political career, first becoming mayor of Cleveland, at the age of 31, and then losing a bid for reelection. Kucinich was later elected to the Senate and then the U.S. House but lost when he ran for president in 2004 and again in 2008. Sen. David Vitter admitted his guilt in the D.C. Madam scandal in 2007. His phone number had been published in 2009 in a list of phone records from a prostitution ring Deborah Jeane Palfrey, also known as the "D.C. Madam." Three years later he was reelected to the Senate.
Marion Barry is sworn in as the mayor of Washington with his wife, Cora Masters Barry, at his side, in 1995. Four years earlier, he was forced from the mayor's office, and later imprisoned, for being caught on videotape smoking crack.
Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974 after the Washington Post broke the story on his role in the Watergate burglary. But before being elected president, Nixon was Dwight Eisenhower's vice president. He lost his first presidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960, and then lost the governor's race in California in 1962. However, in 1968, he got the GOP nomination and defeated Hubert Humphrey in the general election to become president.

Top 10 political comebacks
Sanford's stunning political comeback
Mark Sanford wins a second chance
From the start of his bid for Congress, Sanford was very open on the campaign trail about the affair and made it the subject of his first TV ad. Sanford asked for, and received, political redemption from the voters.
"I want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the reality of our shared humanity," said Sanford at his victory celebration Tuesday night. "I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace."
He repeated that theme minutes later at a news conference with reporters.
"I think we're always on the search for redemption and I think this is certainly a degree of political redemption."
Colbert Busch's campaign, as well as two national Democratic groups which contributed money and support to her campaign, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch confronted Sanford about his 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress.
And her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using "tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character."
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the pro-Democrat House Majority PAC, which, combined, spent nearly $900,000 to try and defeat Sanford, also spotlighted the affair in their final ads.
But in the end, it wasn't enough.
2. Candidates matter
For all his political baggage, Mark Sanford is a veteran on the campaign trail. And Elizabeth Colbert Busch showed her campaign inexperience at times.
"Sanford may be a flawed candidate but he's a fabulous campaigner," said Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, a former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party. "Forget the rhetoric or the policy or the delivery -- hand-to-hand, eye-to-eye he's very good and it's impossible to outwork him."
Sanford also seemed to win this election one voter at a time. The candidate appeared to be everywhere in the campaign's closing days. He held nearly 15 events on Monday, with another 10 on Election Day.
3. Turnout matters
We knew Democratic voters were fired up, but the big question concerned Republican voters in a district that the GOP has held for more 30 years. Would they vote even with their reservations about Sanford?
The answer appears to be yes.
It was a high turnout for a special election. Roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total, according to a CNN analysis of the vote.
"That seems to have helped Sanford," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. "Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat. High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway."
And House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi might be one reason why.
Sanford and his campaign repeatedly tied Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections.
"I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending," Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week.
Two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate.
The strategy appears to have paid off.
4. Location, location, location
Macro: The 1st Congressional District is GOP country. Mitt Romney carried the district by 18 percentage points in last November's presidential election. And Rep. Tim Scott was reelected by 27 points before he was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Even a candidate with serious political baggage like Sanford was able to win.
Micro: Sanford won all five counties in the district. He won big where he needed to, in the conservative counties of Berkeley and Dorchester, taking around 60% of the vote. He carried the district's second most populous county, Beaufort, by 6 percentage points. Some Democrats hoped that older voters in that county, which includes Hilton Head, would be turned off by Sanford's affair.
Sanford narrowly carried his home base of Charleston County, where the most voters were at stake. That was also Colbert Busch's best hope.
5. Money doesn't always matter
Colbert Busch's campaign outspent Sanford's operation in the closing weeks. And the DCCC and House Majority PAC combined spent around $900,000 to try to defeat Sanford, who received far less support from outside groups. Money matters in campaign politics, but it's just one factor in determining a race.

Obamacare applications near half million; website called 'unacceptable'
By Kevin Bohn and David Simpson, CNN
updated 6:57 AM EDT, Mon October 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Administration previously has not released national figures
Glitches have plagued federal sign-up site
Official: "We are going to work intensely"
Estimate of 500,000 applications includes state-run exchanges, which have reported at least 257,000 signups
Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 500,000 people have filled out applications for Obamacare coverage despite the highly publicized problems with online sign-ups, administration officials told CNN Saturday.
"The website is unacceptable, and we are improving it," one senior administration official said. "But the underlying insurance product is good, and across the country people are getting access to affordable care on January 1."
The Affordable Care Act is intended to serve more than 48 million Americans without health insurance. Most Americans face tax penalties if they do not have health insurance by January 1.
The online sign-up process began October 1 and immediately ran into technical problems. Users often were unable to create required logins and passwords and ran into error messages even after that stage. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, who tried to enroll as an experiment, needed two weeks to reach the application stage.

Insurers also have complained of problems. Congressional hearings on the glitches are planned for next week.
The open enrollment period continues through March 31.
"We are going to work intensely for the next six months to make sure we meet the demand," the administration official said.
In the first release of national figures about applications, two officials told CNN on Saturday that the number of completed applications is nearly half a million, including the federal exchange serving 36 states and the state-run exchanges operating in the rest of the country.
An application is only the beginning of the process that leads to enrollment.
Applicants submit personal and financial information. After the program determines whether they are eligible for coverage and for a subsidy toward their premium costs, they can comparison shop and choose an insurance plan.
The federal sign-up site is the gateway for customers in 36 states.
While the administration tally did not break down how many of the applications came through state-run exchanges, a CNN survey this week of officials with those exchanges found that at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans as of Friday afternoon.
Not all of them had made a payment, and not every state responded to the CNN request.
The administration has said it would release in November the number of people who have completed the enrollment process.
CNN's Kevin Bohn and Adam Aigner-Treworgy reported from Washington; David Simpson reported and wrote from Atlanta.
