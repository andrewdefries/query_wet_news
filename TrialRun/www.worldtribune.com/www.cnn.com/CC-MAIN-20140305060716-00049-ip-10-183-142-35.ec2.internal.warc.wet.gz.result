Transcript of GOP debate at Reagan Library Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO This is the transcript of the GOP debate at the Reagan Library Wednesday January 30. The candidates debate Wednesday at The Reagan Library in California. (CNN) -- ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: The first question is actually a question that will go to all of you, but I'll start with Governor Romney. During a 1980 debate, he suggested Americans determine who to vote for by asking themselves, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" So tonight, in terms of the economy, are Americans better off than they were eight years ago? FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Well, if you're voting for George Bush, you'd be very interested in knowing the answer to that. If you're voting for Mitt Romney, you'd like to know, "Are you better off in Massachusetts after four years of my term in office?" And the answer would be decidedly yes. I came into a state which was very much in a deep ditch. It was losing money every month. We had a $3 billion budget gap. We had people losing jobs every single month. During my predecessor's term, we'd lost 160,000 jobs. We kept losing jobs for a couple of years. We got it turned around, began adding jobs back. We won some huge contracts to bring in some new employers into the state. Some of them haven't even built their facilities yet. We solved our budget problem, $3 billion budget gap, without raising taxes. We were able to do that in a way that I think surprised folks. Don't Miss McCain and Romney go at it at GOP debate

COOPER: Let me just interrupt. The question was: Are Americans better off than they were eight years ago? And as you know, there are a lot of Americans out right now who are very interested in the answer. They're not feeling particularly good about their home sales -- the value of their homes dropping down or the unemployment rate rising. How do you feel America is doing? ROMNEY: Well, again, I'm pleased with what I do while I was -- as governor and happy to talk about that record. COOPER: Are you running for governor or are you running for president, though? ROMNEY: But I'm not running on President Bush's record. President Bush can talk about his record. Washington is badly broken. I think we recognize that. Washington has not dealt with the problems that we have in this nation. It hasn't reduced our burdens on our middle class, hasn't solved the Social Security problems, hasn't dealt with the health care crisis that we have in this country, hasn't improved our schools as much as we'd like to get them improved. Nevertheless, this president did pull us out of a deep recession. He put in place two tax cuts which did get the country out of a recession and helped rebuild the country. Now we see ourselves headed apparently towards one again. We hope not. ROMNEY: Whether there's a recession technically or not, one thing we know -- middle-income families are feeling squeezed and people are losing homes and people are having a hard time paying for their gasoline and they're having a hard time paying for heating oil in places that that's a big part of their life. And as a result, we've got people that feel there needs to be a change in Washington and that's something I represent. COOPER: Senator McCain, are Americans better off than they were eight years ago? FORMER SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: I think you could argue that Americans overall are better off, because we have had a pretty good prosperous time, with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened. A lot of jobs have been created. But let's have some straight talk. Things are tough right now. Americans are uncertain about this housing crisis. Americans are uncertain about the economy, as we see the stock market bounce up and down, but more importantly, the economy particularly in some parts of the country, state of Michigan, Governor Romney and I campaigned, not to my success, I might add, and other parts of the country are probably better off. But I think what we're trying to do to fix this economy is important. We've got to address the housing, subprime housing problem. We need to, obviously, have this package go through the Congress as quickly as possible. We need to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, which I voted for twice to do so. I think we need to eliminate the alternate minimum tax that sits out there and challenges 25 million American families. COOPER: It sounds like that we're not better off is what you're saying. MCCAIN: Pardon me? COOPER: It sounds like you're saying we're not better off. MCCAIN: I think we are better off overall if you look at the entire eight-year period, when you look at the millions of jobs that have been created, the improvement in the economy, et cetera. What I'm trying to emphasize, Anderson, that we are in a very serious challenge right now, with a lot of Americans very uncertain about their future, and we've got to give them some comfort. We've got to give them some stimulus. We've got to give them some tax relief. We've got to stop this outrageous squandering spending that causes us to have to borrow money from China, and we've got to get our fiscal house in order. I think we went on a spending spree that, frankly, betrayed Ronald Reagan's principles about tax cuts and restraint of spending. COOPER: Let me just give the question now to Senator -- I'm going to ask everyone. So, Governor Huckabee, if you can, briefly: Are we better off than we were eight years ago? FORMER ARKANSAS GOV. HUCKABEE: I don't think we are. And the real issue, though, let's not blame President Bush for all of this. We've got a Congress who sat around on their hands and done nothing but spend a lot of money and they're spending, leaving us $9 trillion in debt that we're passing on to our grandchildren. I don't blame the president solely for that. So I think if we're asking is George Bush responsible for all this, no. But are we better off? Well, let's look at some factors. Right now, home sales are -- new home starts, anyway, are down 40 percent. That's going to have a cascading impact on everybody who sells lumber, who is in the building trades. If you talk to people who are driving trucks across America today, their fuel prices are significantly higher than they were a year ago. They're hurting because they're not making a lot more money to haul something, but they're spending a lot more money to get it done. And all over our economy, with unemployment up to five percent across the nation, that means there are a lot of families today that don't have a paycheck and if you don't have a paycheck, then it's hard to put groceries on the table and it's hard to pay the rent. And I think what Americans are looking for is somebody to just honest with them and straight with them and tell them that, no, it's not better and it's not going to get better unless we have some serious leadership in Washington that says that we're going to have to start having policies that touch the people not just at the top, but the people at the bottom. And they feel like they're invisible to a lot of people in government today. COOPER: Congressman Paul, 61 percent of Americans think there is a recession already -- 61 percent of Americans say there's already a recession. Are we better off than we were eight years ago? TEXAS REP. RON PAUL: No, no, we're not better off. We're worse off, but it's partially this administration's fault and it's the Congress. But it also involves an economic system that we've had for a long time and a monetary system that we've had and a foreign policy that's coming to an end and we have to admit this. The Republicans were elected in 1994 to change direction of the country, because people sensed there was something wrong, we were going the wrong direction, but we didn't do anything. In the year 2000, we did, also. We were elected in the year 2000 to have a humble foreign policy and not police the world, and yet what are we doing now? We're bogged down in another war. We're bankrupting our country and we have an empire that we're trying to defend which costs us $1 trillion a year. And the standard of living is going down today. It's going down and the middle class is hurting because of the monetary policy. PAUL: When you destroy a currency, the middle class gets wiped out. Poor countries don't even have middle classes. We used to have one, and they're on the ropes right now. But it has to do with a fiscal policy, monetary policy, and foreign policy of way too much spending, but it took a lot of years for us to get here. The people in this country have been begging for a change in direction, and they haven't had it. It's time we gave it to them. COOPER: We've got a lot to get to on the economy. To begin with, let's go to Janet Hook of the L.A. Times. JANET HOOK, LOS ANGELES TIMES: Governor Romney, you've spent the last several days warning voters that John McCain as president would follow, quote, "a liberal, Democratic course." But, by most measures, doesn't he have a pretty mainstream conservative record? ROMNEY: I'm sure on many issues he does, and he's a good Republican. I wouldn't question those credentials at all. But there are a number of pieces of legislation where his views are out of the mainstream, at least in my view, of conservative Republican thought. So, for instance, he's opposed to drilling in ANWR, I believe. If I'm correct -- correct me, Senator. He voted twice against the Bush tax cuts. Only two Republicans did that. He is a co-author of McCain-Feingold, which I think took a whack at the First Amendment and I do believe, as well, hurt our party pretty significantly. And I think it's made money have an even greater influence in politics today, not less influence. He also was one of the co-authors of McCain-Kennedy, the first bill, by the way, not that bad. About 5 percent or 10 percent of the people, by our calculation, got a form of amnesty. Most people went home. Under the final version of McCain-Kennedy, everybody who was here illegally, other than those who committed crimes, was eligible to receive a Z-visa. For $3,000, they got to stay here for the rest of their life. That's not a Republican thought. And then now McCain-Lieberman, which is a unilateral -- meaning U.S.-only imposed -- cap-and-trade program, which puts a burden, as much as 50 cents a gallon, on gasoline in this country. It basically says Americans are going to pay for the cost of global warming, not the Chinese and Indians and forth. So those views are outside the mainstream of Republican conservative thought. And I guess I'd also note that, if you get endorsed by the New York Times, you're probably not a conservative. COOPER: Senator McCain? MCCAIN: Let me note that I was endorsed by your two hometown newspapers who know you best, including the very conservative Boston Herald... ROMNEY: I'd say the same thing. MCCAIN: ... who know you well better than anybody. So I'll guarantee the Arizona Republic will be endorsing me, my friend. Let me just say I'm proud of my conservative record. It's one of reaching across the aisle to get things done for Americans, obviously, whether it be McCain-Lieberman that established the 9/11 commission, and then the legislation that implemented that, or whether it be working across the aisle in the Armed Services Committee to provide the men and women with what they need to defend this nation. And I'm proud of that record. And I heard Governor Romney describe his record. As I understand it, his record was that he raised taxes by $730 million. He called them "fees." I'm sure the people that had to pay it, whether they called them bananas, they still had to pay $730 million extra. His job creation was the third worst in the country, as far as people of Massachusetts with a $245 million debt because of the big government-mandated health care system. And while the rest of the country was losing 7 percent of the manufacturing jobs while he was governor, 14 percent of the manufacturing jobs left the state of Massachusetts. So I am proud of my record, and I am proud of reaching across the aisle and getting things done. That's what the American people want us to do. And the legislation and the activities I've done, particularly in this America's defense, particularly in the fact that I've been involved in every major national security challenge this nation has faced. And, by the way, I think it would be hard for people like Jack Kemp, and Tom Ridge, former head of the Department of Homeland Security, and Phil Gramm, and all of the long list of conservatives that support me, both governors, conservative governors, and, in fact, your former lieutenant governor, who is spending a lot of time on the campaign trail with us. But the point is that I'm proud of the people that have surrounded me and are supporting me. And whether they come from one part of the spectrum or the other, strong conservatives are ones who are supporting me, and I'm proud of their support. And I'll rely on people to judge me by the company that I keep. COOPER: Governor Romney? ROMNEY: OK, I got a little work to do here. Let me help you with the facts here, Senator. First of all, my lieutenant governor, Kerry Healey, endorsed me, and is supporting me, and is working all over the state for me. My predecessor in office, Governor Swift, Governor Swift is supporting you. ROMNEY: When you say that our state ranked number three in job creation, the study you're relying upon is a study that included her term in office. And during her term in office, 141,000 jobs were lost. During my term in office, we added jobs. And from the lowest point we added 60,000 new jobs. So that study, unfortunately, included the wrong data. With regards to fees, we raised fees $240 million. Not $730 million. Facts are stubborn things. We audited our fee increase, because, of course, we cared. Now, why did we raise fees $240 million? We had a $3 billion budget shortfall, we decided we were not going to raise taxes, and we found that some fees hadn't been raised in as many as 20 years. These were not broad-based fees for things like getting your driver's license or your license plate for your car, but instead something like the cost of a sign on the interstate and how much it was going to cost to publish a McDonald's or a Burger King sign on the interstate. We went from, like, $200 a sign to $2,000 a sign to raise money for our state in a way that was consistent with the what the market had done over the ensuing years. And let's see -- with regards to my health care plan, you know, a lot of people talk about health care. I'm the only one that got the job done. I got health insurance for all our citizens. We had 460,000 people without insurance. We got 300 of them -- 300,000 of them signed up for insurance now. I'm proud of what we accomplished. The bill that I submitted to the legislature didn't cost $1 more than what we were already spending. However, the legislature and now the new Democratic governor have added some bells and whistles, and they're willing to pay for them. I wouldn't do that if I were governor. I would veto the items they put in place there, but they're entitled to make changes if they want to. They're still running a balanced budget. I wouldn't have added the money they did. And by the way, no debt was left. I left a rainy day fund of over $2 billion. Facts are stubborn things. I'm proud of my record. COOPER: Governor Huckabee, Rush Limbaugh says if you or Senator McCain were nominated, would be the nominee, you would "destroy the Republican Party." Your reaction? HUCKABEE: You know, I wish Rush loved me as much as I love Rush. I think he's a great voice for conservatism. It doesn't mean he's infallible. And on this he's very wrong. And I want to make sure everybody understands, this isn't a two- man race. There's another guy who would like to stay down here on the far right of the stage. You want to talk conservative credentials? Let me get in on that. I created the first-ever broad-based tax cuts in the 160-year history of my state when I became governor with a 90 percent Democrat legislature. I also balanced the budget every one of the 10 and a half years. I'm the only person that's sitting here today that has consistently supported a human life amendment that's been part of our Republican platform since 1980, and also supports the marriage amendment to our Constitution, two conservative hallmarks. I believe in less government. I believe in lower taxes, not higher. I think it's important to streamline the federal government like we streamlined some services in Arkansas. Simple things like getting a driver's car tag, because it used to take a couple of days and about seven pieces of paper. We streamlined it so it could be done on the Internet in 4 and a half minutes. We consolidated state agencies. We cut 11 percent out of the budget. One of the things that Rush Limbaugh once praised me for was creating what I called the No -- Tax Me More Fund. And the way that worked was that we had a lot of people in our legislature that wanted us to raise taxes. And I said we don't need to raise taxes, we need to cut our spending. And so I created a fund called the Tax Me More Fund and said there's nothing in the law that says that you can't just pay more if you want to. And I had envelopes printed, and I said, anybody who wants to pay more taxes, just fill it up with whatever will make you feel better and send it right in. And it proved that a whole lot of people didn't really want to pay more taxes after all, because after about a year and a half, there was only about $1,200 in the account, $1,000 of which had been given by a liberal legislator. So if we're going to talk conservatism, I'd like to be in on the discussion. COOPER: Let's talk more about that. Jim VandeHei from Politico. jJIM VANDEHEI, POLITICO: The first question from the readers, Governor Romney, is from Jonathan Rubin (ph) in Fairfax, Virginia. "As governor of Massachusetts, Senator McCain just pointed out you raised hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue through so-called fees and loophole closings. You passed a health care bill forcing individuals to buy insurance on the threat of a fine. How do you reconcile that policy with your claim to be the authentic conservative?" ROMNEY: Well, let's talk about each. I mentioned fees, and I think it's appropriate if the state is providing a service to someone that's not a requirement to have a car or a driver's license, but instead, let's say, we're going to be taking out an oil tank from your back yard because it's leaking into the ground and the state's going to provide that service. But to charge a fee sufficient to do so makes a lot of sense. And so the fees ought to be adjusted from time to time to compose the amount of what the cost is of providing that service. And if there hasn't been a fee raised in a couple of decades, you probably have some inflation in there you ought to adjust for. ROMNEY: But then, secondly, with regards to my health care plan, let me describe what I think is the ultimate conservative approach. In this country, you have today about 47 million people that don't have health insurance. We went out and tried to find out why they don't. We found out that about half of them could afford to buy insurance if it were reasonably priced. They could afford to buy it, but they weren't buying it. it? If we get sick, we can go to the hospital and get care for free." And we said: You know what? If somebody could afford insurance, they should either buy the insurance or pay their own way. They don't have to buy insurance if they don't want to, but pay their own way. But they shouldn't be allowed to just show up at the hospital and say, somebody else should pay for me. And so we said: No more free riders. It was like bringing "workfare" to welfare. We said: If you can afford insurance, then either have the insurance or get a health savings account. Pay your own way, but no more free ride. And that was what the mandate did. It said, you have got to come with either the insurance or a health savings account or the like. I think it's the conservative approach, to make sure that people who can afford care are getting it at their expense, not at the expense of the taxpayers and government. That I consider to be a step towards socialism. COOPER: Our next question is from Janet Hook of the L.A. Times. HOOK: This is for Senator McCain. Senator McCain, Governor Schwarzenegger has proposed that California be allowed to implement much tougher environmental regulations on emission requirements than apply to the rest of the country. This is an initiative that conservatives generally oppose, and the Bush administration rejected California's request. Do you side with the governor or with the Bush administration? MCCAIN: Well, there's some physical danger. I have to agree... (LAUGHTER) ... with the governor. Look, I'm a federalist. And I believe the states should decide to enormous degrees what happens within those states, including off their coasts. The people of California have decided they don't want oil drilling off their coasts. The people of Louisiana have decided that they do. I applaud the governor's efforts and that of other states in this region and other states across America to try to eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. Now, suppose that the governor and I are wrong, and there's no such thing as climate change. And we adopt these green technologies, of which America and the innovative skills we have and the entrepreneurship and the free market which is embodied by Senator Lieberman's and mine cap-and-trade proposal is enacted, and there's no such thing as climate change. Then all we've done is give our kids a cleaner world. But suppose we do nothing. Suppose we do nothing, and we don't eliminate this $400 billion dependence we have on foreign oil. Some of that money goes to terrorist organizations and also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Then what kind of a world have we given our children? The state of California and the state of Arizona, we Westerners care very much about our environment and we want to act. And it's no secret that I have disagreed with the Bush administration in not being more active in addressing the issue of climate change, whether it be through cap-and-trade, through tax incentives for R&D for green technologies and many other measures that I think need to be taken. We are feeling here in California pollution from China. It is a global issue, and we have to address it globally. And I would not agree to any global agreement without India and China being part of it. But I want to assure you that we have an obligation to try to stem these greenhouse gas emissions. And one of the ways is through the use of nuclear power. The French generate 80 percent of their electricity with nuclear power. I think that -- by the way, we now have a pro-American president in France, which shows if you live long enough, anything is possible in this world. But the point is, young Americans care. Californians care. People all over this country care. And we have to address this issue. We can do it. The greatness and strength of America is in our innovative capability and our ability to develop these green technologies. General Electric, the world's largest corporation, is committed to green technologies. We can do it. And to somehow believe that it will cost more money if we unleash the innovative and entrepreneurship of America I think does not have confidence in the ability of Americans to address this issue. COOPER: Governor Romney, what did you think of Senator McCain's response? And just to remind you, the original question is do you side with Governor Schwarzenegger or with the Bush administration on this issue? ROMNEY: Well, I side with states to be able to make their own regulations with regards to emissions within their own states. ROMNEY: But let's talk about our policies with regards to greenhouse gases and global warming. I think we all agree that America should become energy independent. The consequences of us continuing to buy over $1 billion of oil a day from people who oftentimes use this money against us is bad for our economy; it's bad for our foreign policy; and all that energy being used is probably bad for our environment. It's probably warming our environment. And we want that to stop. So a unilateral action to get ourselves off of foreign oil makes all the sense in the world. Nuclear power, biodiesel, biofuel, all the renewables, liquefied coal, where you sequester the carbon dioxide, those things make all the sense in the world. But when you put in place a new cap or a mandate, and particularly if you don't have any safety valve as to how much the cost of that cap might be, you would impose on the American people, if you do it unilaterally, without involving all the world, you'd impose on the American people a huge new effective tax: 20 percent on utilities, 50 cents a gallon for gasoline -- that's according to the energy information agency -- would be imposed on us. And here's what happens. I've lived in the business world. I've lived in the real economy for 25 years of my life. What happens if you do that? You put a big burden on energy in this country as the energy-intensive industries say, "We're going to move our new facilities from America to China, where they don't have those agreements." And you end up polluting and putting just as much CO-2 in the air because the big energy users go there. That's why these ideas make sense, but only on a global basis. They don't call it "America warming." They call it "global warming." That's why you've got to have a president that understands the real economy. COOPER: Just so I'm clear, you said you side with the states. That means you side with Governor Schwarzenegger on this one? ROMNEY: I side with states being able to make their own decisions, even if I don't always agree with the decisions they make. COOPER: Governor Huckabee? HUCKABEE: Well, I was a governor 10 1/2 years. I was chairman of the National Governors Association, which means that my fellow governors selected me to chair the organization of all 50 governors. Let me tell you why I believe that Governor Schwarzenegger ought to be able to carry out the plan, because, if he's right, every other state is going to copy him. And if he's wrong, every other state is going to recruit the jobs that he lost in California to their own states. The genius of our system has always been that, if you have states acting as laboratories of good government, rather than mess it up for all 50 states, you get the chance to find out, does it work? And if it does, we all copy it, and then we make a little change, and we claim it for our own. If it doesn't work, we do everything we can to make sure that the jobs that maybe he loses we get in our own state. It's the genius of our founding fathers when they had the idea of federalism. Thomas Jefferson was right, and Alexander Hamilton was wrong. That debate we thought was settled. But we've got a federal government that wants to give us unfunded mandates at the state level and doesn't want us to experiment with ideas in good government that might solve a lot of the problems that our country faces. COOPER: Congressman Paul, do you agree with Governor Schwarzenegger on this one? PAUL: Yes, I think California should do what they want, and we all recognize that. But one thing that hasn't been emphasized here that should be emphasized when we're dealing with the environment and gas house -- you know, greenhouse gases is property rights. We neglected during the industrial revolution property rights, and governments and big corporations got together and colluded. And that's what has to be reversed. You have to emphasize the property rights. But I would like to take one minute, since I didn't get a chance to answer this discussion on conservative versus liberal. COOPER: We're going to have -- I promise you we're going to have -- you're going to have another opportunity to do that. I promise you, coming up in like two minutes or two questions. I just want to go right now to Janet Hook for a question to Governor Huckabee. HOOK: Let's turn for a minute to the troubled economy we're trying to deal with. Governor Huckabee, President Bush and some of your opponents on the stage here believe that giving income tax rebates is the best way to stimulate the economy. You've disagreed and suggested that spending federal highway money to widen I-95 from Bangor to Miami would do more to help the nation's economy. Now, how is that idea different from the big- government projects that we usually associate with Democrats? HUCKABEE: Well, if we end up with the rebates, we're going to borrow the $150 billion from China. And when we turn it into rebates, most people are going to go out and buy some consumables like a pair of shoes that they probably don't even need, but they're going to buy them, and they're most likely an import from China. My point is, whose economy are we stimulating when we do that? The Heritage Foundation did a pretty interesting study on past rebates and found that it does not really stimulate the economy in the way that we hope that it will. My point was that if you really want an economic stimulus package, look at what infrastructure investment does. And we've got a crumbling infrastructure. I don't have to tell the people of California that their traffic is clogged. And the reason that we have a problem is that because we're not addressing it. Every billion dollars we spend on highway construction results in 47,500 jobs. But the fact is the average American is sitting in traffic 38 hours a year. HUCKABEE: That's a full work week, not on vacation, not spent with their kids, stuck in traffic, just sitting there behind the wheel, pointing fingers, usually one at a time, at other motorists and very upset with what's going on around them in this traffic. The point is we are burning a lot of fuel up in the air, polluting the environment. We're wasting time. Parents never get home to their kids' soccer games and recitals. And the real said thing is we have bridges falling down on people in the United States of America. Now, my point is, and it's not necessarily just I-95 from Bangor to Miami, I said that when I was in Florida. Today we might look at a western highway that would go down the California coast. But my point is that infrastructure in this country has been neglected, whether it's our airports, our bridges, our roads, and I don't think there's a governor in this state that wouldn't tell you that you'll create more jobs and you'll build it with American workers, American concrete and American steel. That's stimulus. COOPER: Let's ask the other governor on the stage. Governor Romney, what do you think about that? ROMNEY: There's no question but that investment in infrastructure makes enormous sense for our country. It's good for business, it's good for the economy, and as the governor that watched the completion -- well, almost the completion of the big dig, I think that was -- I don't know how many governors watched that $15 billion project. They do create a lot of good jobs and they help our economy. They're great things. But, unfortunately, a road project isn't going to stimulate the economy to the timeframe we have right now at the tipping point. And that's... COOPER: Was the big dig good, by the way? ROMNEY: As someone once said, at least badly, of course. So someone has remarked that it's the biggest car was in America and most expensive, too. It's solved a problem, but it cost way too much money to do. It was very badly managed. But that being said, an economic stimulus plan has to put money in the hands of consumers and businesses and homeowners now and the reason we're asking Congress to move within 30 days is we want to get that out there now so the economy doesn't tip down. Building a road project, you have to get designs, you have eminent domain, you get the engineers to approve it. It takes years and years and years to get a road project. So it's a wonderful idea, but it's not related to the short-term economic stimulus. COOPER: Congressman Paul? PAUL: Well, you know, the governor says that you have to borrow for a handout of a check from the Chinese. Where are you going to get the money to build the highway? Same old thing. We have a foreign policy where we blow up bridges overseas and then we tax the people to go over and rebuild the bridges overseas and our bridges are falling down and our infrastructure is falling down. So, yes, this money should be spent back here at home. We have a $1 trillion foreign operation to operate our empire. That's where the money is. You can't keep borrowing from China. You can't keep printing the money. We have to cut some spending. That's what nobody here talks about. Where do you cut spending if you want to spend some money? We need lower taxes, less regulations, and we need to free up the market. We can't expect the government to do everything. We have to faith and confidence that the market works, but you can't do any of that unless you look at the monetary system. COOPER: Next question to Senator McCain from Jim Vandehei. VANDEHEI: We're staying on the economy here. As you well know, foreclosures last year were up 75 percent. A lot of people are losing homes. A lot of people who have adjustable rate mortgages are about to have them adjust up. Amanda Oro (ph) from Casey, Illinois wants to know if you have a plan to help people with bad credit get lower interest rates so they can keep those homes and avoid foreclosure. MCCAIN: Yes, and it's tough and it's tough here in California, it's tough in Arizona, it's tough particularly all over, but it's very tough particularly in the high growth states. And I think the efforts that have been made so far are laudable. We may have to go further, but the fact that the FHA and the other organizations of government under Secretary Paulson's direction, and I think he is doing a good job of sitting down and fixing at least a significant number of these problems. I think that we've got to return to the principal that you don't lend money that can't pay it back. I think that there's some greedy people on Wall Street that perhaps need to be punished. I think there's got to be a huge amount more of transparency as to how this whole thing came about so we can prevent it from happening again. When a town on Norway is somehow affected by the housing situation in the United States of America, we've gotten ourselves into a very interesting dilemma. If necessary, we're going to have to take additional actions and particularly in cleaning up a mortgage. A mortgage should be one page and there should be big letters at the bottom that says, "I understand this document." We ought to adjust the mortgages so people who were eligible for better terms, but were somehow convinced to accept the mortgages which were more onerous on them. We need to fix the rating systems, which clearly were erroneous in their ratings, which led people to believe that there were these institutions which were stable, which clearly were not. MCCAIN: So I think what we've done so far is good. I think we may have to take further steps if this subprime lending situation continues to be serious. And finally, could I just mention on the issue of rebates, fine, because part of this is psychological. Part of the problem we have, of course, in any recession is psychological. And I'm still optimistic that nothing is inevitable. I still rely on the innovation and the talent of the United States of America. But we've got to make the tax cuts permanent. We need to get rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax. We need to give people a depreciation in one year for their business and investment. We need to encourage research and development and tax credits that are associated with it. And we've got to stop spending. We've got to stop -- one place where Ron Paul and I are in total agreement, spending is out of control. And I'm tired of borrowing money from China. COOPER: Let's pick up on that with Janet Hook from the Los Angeles Times. Janet? HOOK: Senator McCain, you're talking about making the tax cuts permanent. And as Governor Romney pointed out before, you opposed the Bush tax cuts the first time around. Now, more recently you've been saying that the reason why you opposed the tax cuts at first was because they weren't offset by spending cuts. But back when you actually voted against the tax cuts in Congress, you said you opposed them because they favored the wealthy too much. So which is it? And if they were too skewed to the wealthy at first, are they still too skewed to the wealthy? MCCAIN: Actually, I think lower and middle income Americans need more help. Obviously, I think that's the case today. That's one reason why we're giving them rebates. I was part of the Reagan revolution. I was there with Jack Kemp and Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman and all these other fighters that wanted to change a terrible economic situation in America with 10 percent unemployment and 20 percent interest rates. I was proud to be a foot soldier, support those tax cuts, and they had spending restraints associated with it. I made it very clear when I ran in 2000 that I had a package of tax cuts which were very important and very impactful, but I also had restraints in spending. And I disagreed when spending got out of control. And I disagreed when we had tax cuts without spending restraint. And guess what? Spending got out of control. Republicans lost the 2006 election not over the war in Iraq, over spending. Our base became disenchanted. If we had done what I wanted to do, we would not only have had the spending restraint, but we'd be talking about additional tax cuts today. I'm proud of my record. I'm proud of my record as a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution, and now I'm prepared to lead in restraining spending. COOPER: Governor Romney, what do you think of Senator McCain's response? ROMNEY: I appreciate his response and appreciate the fact he was part of the Reagan revolution. I think that the Bush revolution and the downturn that we faced when he came in office suggested that we needed a tax cut. There's no question in my mind that Ronald Reagan would have said sign it and vote for it. And Senator McCain was one of two that did not. And again, the justification at the time was because it represents a tax cut for the rich. I believe in getting rates down. I think that builds our economy. When we talk about spending, however, I hope people in the country understand that most people in Washington, most politicians, generally want to talk about the $2 and $3 and $4 relative items. And they want to talk about the big one. Right now, federal spending is about 60 percent for entitlements -- Social security, Medicare and Medicaid. And that's growing like crazy. It will be 70 percent entitlements, plus interest, by the time of the next president's second term. And then the military is about 20 percent today. No one is talking about cutting the military, we ought to grow it. So people talk about the 20 percent and how we have to go after that 20 percent. There's not enough in the 20 percent to go after if we don't go after the entitlement problem. And you listen to all the folks running for president, no one wants to talk about it. But we have to talk about it. We have to put together a plan that says we're going to rein in the excessive growth in those areas, promising to meet the obligations we made to seniors. We're not going to change the deal on seniors, but we're going to have to change the deal for 20 and 30 and 40-year- olds, or we're going to bankrupt our country. COOPER: Let's talk about another issue which a lot of Americans watching tonight, immigration. And Jim VandeHei has a question. VANDEHEI: Obviously, we're here in California, where one-third of the population is Hispanic, Latino. Immigration has been a huge issue in this campaign from the beginning. Governor Huckabee, Brian Berry (ph) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, wants to know, "In order to curb illegal immigration, do you support making changes in the law that would give citizenship only to children who are born to parents who are legally in this country at the time the child is born?" HUCKABEE: I think the Supreme Court has already ruled on that. The real issue is, that doesn't fix the problem. HUCKABEE: What we've got to do is to have a secure border fence, something I have proposed that we do within 18 months of taking office. If we don't have a secure fence and have just this open door that people can come in and out at will, we're never going to deal with this issue effectively and responsibly. And today, many Americans are angry not that people want to come here -- and I've repeatedly said and I'm going to say it again -- people in this country I think are grateful to God they're in a land that people are trying to break into and not one they're trying to break out of. So it's not that we're building a fence so we can keep our people in or keep people out, but that people who do come here would have to come legally. And touching the issue of those born here is not the challenge. It's two things. It's first making sure that that fence is built, I think within 18 months. And the second thing is that we have a process where the people who are here would have to go to the back of the line and start over. And it's not to be cruel. I want to make sure you understand. It's to make that everybody who is living in our boundaries has their head up and lives in the light, not the darkness, and doesn't run and hide every time they see a police car. We owe it not just to the people who have waited in line a long time. We owe it to the people who do want to live here and work here, but create a system that is legal, that makes sense, and that actually protects our borders but protects the dignity and worth of every person. VANDEHEI: Governor Romney, I interviewed you in New Hampshire a couple of weeks ago and we talked a little bit about illegal immigration. You've taken a very hard stance against illegal immigration. You said at the time that you felt that there's, for a lot of illegal immigrants who are here, under your plan, we could deport many of them within 90 days. How could that happen? How could we do it that quickly? ROMNEY: I think you may be confusing me with somebody else, but perhaps not. Let me tell you what my plan is. VANDEHEI: At the time -- I can just give you the quote if you like. You said that "many of those could be deported immediately," but that would allow slower deportation process for those with thought as quickly as 90 days. ROMNEY: My plan is this, which is for those that have come here illegally and are here illegally today, no amnesty. Now, how do people return home? Under the ideal setting, at least in my view, you say to those who have just come in recently, we're going to send you back home immediately, we're not going to let you stay here. You just go back home. For those that have been here, let's say, five years, and have kids in school, you allow kids to complete the school year, you allow people to make their arrangements, and allow them to return back home. Those that have been here a long time, with kids that have responsibilities here and so forth, you let stay enough time to organize their affairs and go home. But the key is this: These individuals are free to get in line with everyone else that wants to become a permanent resident or citizen. But no special pathway, no special deal that says because you're here illegally, you get to stay here for the rest of your life. And that's what I found to be so offensive with the Z visa, which was in the McCain-Kennedy bill. It said to all illegal aliens, unless you're a criminal, you're all allowed to stay here for $3,000 for the rest of your life. And that's a mistake. In my view, let us have a fixed period of time -- 90 days for some, depending on their circumstances, others longer, to the end of the school year -- even longer potentially. Do it in a humane and compassionate way, but say to those who have come here legally, you must return home, you must get in line with everybody else that wants to come here. There are millions throughout the world who want to come to this country legally. It's a wonderful privilege. But those that have come here illegally should not be given a better deal. I was just at the swearing in of some 700 citizens just a day or two ago in Tampa, Florida, and it was a thrilling thing to see these folks coming out, shaking their hands. People who come here legally are a great source of vitality and strength for our country. COOPER: Let's follow up... ROMNEY: But illegal immigration, that's got to end. COOPER: Janet Hook with the L.A. Times with a follow-up question. (APPLAUSE) HOOK: Senator McCain, let me just take the issue to you, because you obviously have been very involved in it. During this campaign, you, like your rivals, have been putting the first priority, heaviest emphasis on border security. But your original immigration proposal back in 2006 was much broader and included a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were already here. What I'm wondering is -- and you seem to be downplaying that part. At this point, if your original proposal came to a vote on the Senate floor, would you vote for it? MCCAIN: It won't. It won't. That's why we went through the debate... HOOK: But if it did? MCCAIN: No, I would not, because we know what the situation is today. The people want the border secured first. And so to say that that would come to the floor of the Senate -- it won't. We went through various amendments which prevented that ever -- that proposal. But, look, we're all in agreement as to what we need to do. Everybody knows it. We can fight some more about it, about who wanted this or who wanted that. But the fact is, we all know the American people want the border secured first. MCCAIN: We will secure the borders first when I am president of the United States. I know how to do that. I come from a border state, where we know about building walls, and vehicle barriers, and sensors, and all of the things necessary. I will have the border state governors certify the borders are secured. And then we will move onto the other aspects of this issue, probably as importantly as tamper-proof biometric documents, which then, unless an employer hires someone with those documents, that employer will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And that will cause a lot of people to leave voluntarily. There's 2 million people who are here who have committed crimes. They have to be rounded up and deported. And we're all basically in agreement there are humanitarian situations. It varies with how long they've been here, et cetera, et cetera. We are all committed to carrying out the mandate of the American people, which is a national security issue, which is securing the borders. That was part of the original proposal, but the American people didn't trust or have confidence in us that we would do it. So we now know we have to secure the borders first, and that is what needs to be done. That's what I'll do as president of the United States. COOPER: So I just want to confirm that you would not vote for your bill as it originally was? MCCAIN: My bill will not be voted on; it will not be voted on. I will sit and work with Democrats and Republicans and with all people. And we will have the principals securing the borders first. And then, if you want me to go through the description all over again, I would be glad to. We will secure the borders first. That's the responsibility and the priority of the American people. COOPER: Actually, we're going to be taking a short break. But before we do, one other question. This one goes to Governor Huckabee. On July 6, 1981, which is actually Nancy Reagan's birthday, Ronald Reagan wrote in his diary about Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. And the Reagan Library has graciously allowed us to actually have the original Reagan diary right here on the desk. I'm a little too nervous to actually even touch it, but that is the Ronald Reagan's original diary. And in it, he wrote by his hand, he said, "Called Judge O'Connor in Arizona and told her she was my nominee for Supreme Court. Already the flak is starting, and from my own supporters. Right-to-life people say she's pro-abortion. She declares abortion is personally repugnant to her. I think she'll make a good justice." That's Ronald Reagan's words from his own book. Governor Huckabee, was she the right choice? HUCKABEE: History will have to determine that, and I'm not going to come to the Reagan Library and say anything about Ronald Reagan's decisions. I'm not that stupid. If I was, I'd have no business being president. I think we need to talk about why the issue of right-to-life is important. For many of us, this is not a political issue; this is an issue of principle and conviction. And it goes to the heart of who we are as a country. If we value each other as human beings and believe that everybody has equal worth, and that that intrinsic value is not affected by net worth, or ancestry, or last name, or job description, or ability, or disability, then the issue of the sanctity of human life is far bigger than just being anti-abortion. It's about being pro-life and exercising that deep conviction held by our founding fathers that all of us are equal and no one is more equal than another, recognizing that once we ever decide that some people are more equal or less equal than others, then we start moving that line, and it may include us some day. And that's why for many of us -- and me included. Let me be very clear: I'm pro-life. I value every human being. And I would always make every decision always on the side of life every time I could, without equivocation. COOPER: Yes or no, Congressman Paul, was Sandra Day O'Connor the right choice? PAUL: I wouldn't have appointed her, because I would have looked for somebody that I would have seen as a much stricter constitutionalist. COOPER: Senator McCain? MCCAIN: I'm proud of Sandra Day O'Connor as a fellow Arizonan. And my heart goes out to her family in that situation that they have today. And I'm proud of her. The judges I would appoint are along the lines of Justices Roberts and Alito, who have a proven record of strict interpretation of the Constitution of the United States of America. I'm not going to second-guess President Reagan. COOPER: Governor Romney? ROMNEY: I would approve justices -- I would have favored justices like Roberts and Alito, Scalia and Thomas. I like justices that follow the Constitution, do not make law from the bench. I would have much rather had a justice of that nature. COOPER: We're going to pause for a quick commercial break. The debate continues when we return. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: And welcome back to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, our continuing debate. We have about a little bit more than 30 minutes left to go. A lot of questions to get to, so let's get started. This first one to Governor Romney. Peggy Noonan, President Bush's former -- excuse me, President Reagan's former speechwriter, recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal, and I quote, "George W. Bush destroyed the Republican Party, by which I mean he sundered it, broke its constituent pieces apart, and set them against each other. He did this on spending, the size of government, war, the ability to prosecute war, immigration, and other issues." Is the Republican Party better off than it was eight years ago? ROMNEY: I don't think we would say it's better off than it was eight years ago, to be truthful. I think the eight years that you've seen -- and I don't blame that on President Bush. I blame that on Washington. I look at what he tried to do. He took on some tough issues. He took on Social Security, for instance, put forward a plan to reform Social Security, and the other side of the aisle said, "What, me, worry? "We've got no problem." And they were unwilling to become engaged and take that on. He was hit by something which completely took his agenda off course, and that was the Iraq conflict and the attack of 9/11, and Afghanistan. All these things came together. He did something for our party that was important to do, which is to show that when someone attacks America, there will be consequences. And he kept us safe these last six years. And... (APPLAUSE) And that's a very important legacy that he left for the Republican Party in a positive way. And I watched with horror as I watched the Democratic candidates for president all having a competition. get out?" It was very clear in the answer of all three candidates getting out was more important than winning, and they're wrong. And I'm pleased that this president has stood for strength. There are places, however, that I think you look and say we have weakened ourselves. One is with regards to spending. We have overspent in Washington. Even discretionary funds have gone up well above inflation. I count the inflation less 1 percent, but that was a problem. We did not deal with entitlements. He tried. He did not get the support he needed. He did fight for better schools. I think No Child Left Behind takes the ball forward, not backward. COOPER: OK. ROMNEY: So we made some progress. But we're in the house that Reagan built. It's important that we, as Republicans, stay in the house that Reagan built. If we want to take the White House again, social, economic and foreign policy conservatives have to come together. COOPER: Let's talk about foreign policy. You're all going to be able to weigh in on the question of Iraq. (APPLAUSE) Let's go right now to Janet for the first question. HOOK: Yes. I'd like to start with Governor Romney. Obviously, Iraq is still a major issue in this campaign, and over the last few days there's been a real back-and-forth going on here. Senator McCain has said over and over again that you supported a timetable for a phased withdrawal from Iraq. Is that true? ROMNEY: Absolutely, unequivocal -- if I can get that word out -- unequivocably, absolutely no. I have never, ever supported a specific timetable for exit from Iraq. ROMNEY: And it's offensive to me that someone would suggest that I have. And I have noted that everyone from Time magazine to Bill Bennett over there to actually CNN's own analysts, he said it was a lie and it's absolutely wrong. I do not support that, never have. We've had -- we've -- and Senator McCain pointed to an interview I had back in April with ABC, when I said that our president and their prime minister should have timetables and milestones. We have timetables and milestones for progress that we're making together. But I never suggested a date specific to withdraw and, were to give you a date specific for withdrawal, would you, Senator, veto it?" I said I'd veto it. I'm opposed to setting a specific date for withdrawal. By the way, we've had, since that time, 10-12 debates. Senator McCain never raised that question in any of those debates. If he ever wondered what my position was, he could have raised it. I instead have pointed out time and time again, and let me make it absolutely clear again tonight, I will not pull our troops out until we have brought success in Iraq, and that means, for me, that we do not have safe havens for al Qaeda or Hezbollah or anyone else, that our troops have secured the population from that kind of threat, that they will not have safe havens from which they could launch attacks against us. And if there's any misunderstanding, those words should make it perfectly clear, as have every single debate that I've attended... COOPER: Senator... ROMNEY: ... 15 debates. I do not propose nor have I ever proposed a public or secret date for withdrawal. It's just simply wrong. And by the way, raising it a few days before the Florida primary, when there was very little time for me to correct the record, when the date of withdrawal," sort of falls in the kind of dirty tricks that I think Ronald Reagan would have found to be reprehensible. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator McCain, tough words. MCCAIN: Well, of course, he said he wanted a timetable. Before that, we have to understand that we lost the 2006 election and the Democrats thought that they had a mandate. They thought they had a mandate to get us out of Iraq. And I was prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary in order to stand up for what I believed in. Now, in December of 2006, after the election, Governor Romney was won't weigh in. I'm a governor." At the time, he didn't want to weigh in because he was a governor, I was out there on the front lines with my friends saying, "We not only can't withdraw, but we've got to have additional troops over there in order for us to have a chance to succeed." Then in April, April was a very interesting year (sic) in 2007. That's when Harry Reid said the war is lost and we've got to get out. And the buzzword was "timetables, timetables." Governor, the right answer to that question was "no," not what you said, and that was we don't want to have them lay in the weeds until we leave and Maliki and the president should enter into some kind of agreement for, quote, "timetables." "Timetables" was the buzzword for the... ROMNEY: Why don't you use the whole quote, Senator? MCCAIN: ... withdrawal. That... ROMNEY: Why don't you use the whole quote? Why do you insist on... MCCAIN: I'm using the whole quote, where you said "I won't"... ROMNEY: ... not using the actual quote? That's not what I said. MCCAIN: The actual quote is, "We don't want them to lay in the weeds until we leave." That is the actual quote and I'm sure... ROMNEY: What does that mean? MCCAIN: ... fact-checkers -- ROMNEY: What is the meaning? MCCAIN: It means a timetable until we leave. ROMNEY: Listen, Senator, let's... COOPER: Let me jump in, because the quote that I have... ROMNEY: Is it not fair -- is it not fair to have the person who's being accused of having a position he doesn't have be the expert on what his position is? How is it that you're the expert on my position, when my position has been very clear? (APPLAUSE) I'll tell you, this is... MCCAIN: I'm the expert. I'm the expert on this. When you said... ROMNEY: This is the kind -- this is the kind -- this is... MCCAIN: ... "I won't weigh in. I'm a governor." You couldn't weigh in because you were a governor... ROMNEY: That's a separate point. MCCAIN: ... back when we were having the fight over it. ROMNEY: That's a separate point. MCCAIN: The fact is... ROMNEY: That's a separate point. MCCAIN: ... that I have fought for this surge. I have said we need to have this succeed. I know the situation in Iraq and I am proud to have supported this president and supported the fact that we are succeeding in Iraq today. ROMNEY: There's... MCCAIN: If we had done -- if we had waited and laid in the weeds until we leave, then al Qaeda would have won and we would be facing a disastrous situation in the... COOPER: There's two separate issues being discussed... MCCAIN: ... today. COOPER: ... and I just want to clarify both of them. First of all... MCCAIN: These are... COOPER: ... Senator McCain... MCCAIN: ... quotes that I am giving you that are direct quotes. COOPER: So, Senator McCain, the quote is from Governor Romney on GMA that you've been quoting. The actual quote is, "Well, there's no question that the president and Prime Minister al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones"... MCCAIN: Timetables and milestones. COOPER: ... "that they speak about, but those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone." MCCAIN: You don't have to... COOPER: He does not say he is supporting a withdrawal. MCCAIN: ... wait until the enemy lays in the weeds until we leave. That means that we were leaving. COOPER: It's open to interpretation. MCCAIN: If we weren't leaving, how could the enemy lay in the weeds? (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: Senator, if you have question on this, if you have a question on this, you can just ask it. MCCAIN: I'm sorry you did not have -- could not weigh in as governor on the surge when it was the critical issue. And I'm sorry... (CROSSTALK) COOPER: ... so let me just allow you to respond to the issue of the going to be gone, laying in the weeds question. MCCAIN: Timetables was the buzzword for those that wanted to get out. COOPER: OK. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: And you're saying, point blank, you did not want to get out then. What did you mean by that statement? ROMNEY: That we have a series of timetables and milestones for working on the progress that they're making, the progress we're making, the rule of law, what their soldiers are doing, what our soldiers are doing. COOPER: OK. ROMNEY: How many troops they're able to recruit, how well the following question, "do you have a specific time, would you support Congress if they gave you a specific time?" I said "absolutely not." COOPER: Let me -- OK, on the... ROMNEY: By the way, this has been around. If this was a question, it could have been raised in April or May. COOPER: On the second issue... ROMNEY: But it was raised... (CROSSTALK) COOPER: I want to give you an opportunity... MCCAIN: It was raised many times. I raised it many times, as to whether you have the experience and the judgment to lead this country in the war against radical Islamic extremism. I've raised that many times. ROMNEY: Senator McCain... MCCAIN: And I will continue to raise it. COOPER: I want to give you, Governor Romney... (CROSSTALK) COOPER: ... a chance to respond to the other accusation. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: All right. Let's just focus on this, the second one, which is the issue that Senator McCain raised, which was actually back in the surge, when you were a governor, and you did say you would not take a position. This was in January -- excuse me -- December of 2006. Two months later, you announced you were running for president. Why two months before you were running for president were you not willing to take a position on supporting or not supporting a surge? ROMNEY: Look, as governor of the state, there are a lot of issues of a federal nature that I didn't take a position on. I was running a state. My responsibility was for running a state. When I became a governor, I took a whole series of positions on national issues. That's normal and natural. With regard to the surge, the briefing that I received -- I received an early briefing from Fred Kagan on the size of our military. After I received that, I said I support increasing our military by at least 100,000. And then just prior to the president's announcement of the surge, I spoke again with Fred Kagan, and he laid out the philosophy of the surge, his vision for it. As you know, many consider him one of the authors of the surge idea. And when he gave me that report, I met with my staff and announced that day that I supported a surge. The president announced later that day the entire program. So I supported it as a candidate for president, No. 1. No. 2, with regards to this idea that I favor a specific date for withdrawal -- I do not. We've had, I believe since that interview that the senator quotes, we've had 10 or 12 debates. He's never raised that issue with me. He's never said, "are you for a date specific?" had, I said I will not leave Iraq until we have secured Iraq, make sure it will never become a safe haven. And what's interesting here is it's an attempt to do the Washington-style old politics, which is lay a charge out there, regardless of whether it's true or not, don't check it, don't talk to the other candidate, just throw it out there, get it in the media and the stream. There's not a single media source that I've seen that hasn't said it wasn't reprehensible. Even the New York Times said it was wrong. The Washington Post -- they endorsed you -- The Washington Post gave you three Pinocchios for it. It's simply -- it's simply wrong, and the senator knows it. COOPER: I want to give, Senator, final comment on this subject, and then we have a lot more about Iraq that we are going to talk to the other candidates about as well. (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: ... in the debate. It wasn't -- it wasn't -- and when he said what he said in December, it was after the election. President Bush fired Rumsfeld, and we announced that we are going to have a new strategy. That was the critical time. Timetables was the buzzwords. Timetables were the ones. And as far as Washington politics is concerned, I think my friend Governor Huckabee, sir, will attest the millions of dollars of attack ads and negative ads you leveled against him in Iowa, the millions of dollars of attack ads you have attacked against me in New Hampshire, and have ever since. A lot of it is your own money. You're free to do with it what you want to. You can spend it all. But the fact is that... (LAUGHTER) ... your negative ads, my friend, have set the tone, unfortunately, in this campaign. I say to you again: The debate after the election of 2006 was whether we were going to have timetables for withdrawal or not. Timetables were the buzzword. That was the Iraq Study Group. That was what the Democrats said we wanted to do. Your answer should have been no. COOPER: I want to go to Jim VandeHei with a question for, I believe, Congressman Paul. VANDEHEI: Congressman Paul, this comes from Jay Majumdar (ph) from Roswell, Georgia. And he wants to know if you agree with Senator McCain's statement that the United States might need to have U.S. troops in Iraq for as long as even 100 years? PAUL: I don't even think they should have gone, so keeping them for 100 years, where's the money going to come from? (APPLAUSE) You know, the country is in bankruptcy. And when I listen to this argument, I mean, I find it rather silly, because they're arguing technicalities of a policy they both agree with. They agreed with going in; they agreed for staying, agreed for staying how many years? And these are technicalities. We should be debating foreign policy, whether we should have interventionism or non-interventionism, whether we should be defending this country or whether we should be the policemen of the world, whether we should be running our empire or not, and how are going to have guns and butter? You know, the '70s were horrible because we paid for the guns and butters of the '60s. Now we're doing the same thing. And nobody even seems to care. The dollar is crashing, and you're talking about these technicalities about who said what when? I mean, in 1952, we Republicans were elected to stop the war in Korea. In 1968, we were elected to stop the war in Vietnam. And, tragically, we didn't stop it very fast: 30,000 more men died. So when I talk about these long-term stays, I think, "How many men are you willing to let die for this, for something that has nothing to do with our national security?" There were no al Qaeda there. It had nothing do with 9/11. And there was no threat to our national security. They never committed aggression. It's unconstitutional. It's an undeclared war. And we have these silly arguments going on about who said what when. I think it's time to debate foreign policy and why we don't follow the Constitution and only go to war with a declaration of war. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Governor Huckabee, the idea of a 100-year involvement of the U.S. -- the idea of a 100-year involvement by the U.S. in Iraq? HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, I didn't come here to umpire a ballgame between these two. I came here to get a chance to swing at a few myself. So I'd appreciate maybe a question that we could talk about that would involve some of us down here at the end who've been left out of the discussion for the last few minutes. COOPER: The question right now is John McCain had at one point talked about a 100-year involvement by the U.S. in Iraq as being OK. If it does... HUCKABEE: Let's hope it doesn't take that long, but the one thing I do agree with is that we need to leave with victory, and we need to leave with honor. And the reason we need to is because, if we leave a bigger mess in Iraq than is there now, it is not just going to affect Iraq. It's going to affect the rest of the Middle East. It will erupt in a completely destabilized environment into which that vacuum is exactly the kind of situation that al Qaeda can build a strong base. Iran would love to be able to see a destabilized Iraq, because they've been fighting in Iraq and for Iraq for a long time. If we leave it vulnerable, all we've done is create a situation that the rest of the world is going to have to be back into sooner or later for all of our interests. And with all due respect, Congressman Paul -- and I do think you're right, we don't want to be there for 100 years -- but however long it takes to get out of there with victory and with honor, we owe it to those who have gone to make sure that they did not go in vain. And we need to make sure that future sons and daughters of America don't have to go back and do it over. COOPER: Also, for accuracy's sake, I just want to point out Senator McCain was talking about 100-year involvement in the same way as the U.S. being involved in South Korea, not at the current situation that it is now. Janet Hook, you have another question on foreign policy for Governor Huckabee. HOOK: I have another one for you, Governor Huckabee. MCCAIN: You're not going to let me address the quote that you attributed to me? COOPER: All right, fine, if you could briefly. MCCAIN: Thank you. It's a false argument. It's a false argument. We are going to be there for some period of time, but it's American casualties, not American presence. We've got troops right next door in Kuwait. We'll probably have them there for a long time. We have troops in Bosnia. We've had troops in South Korea for some 50 years. By the way, President Eisenhower didn't bail us out of Korea. But the point is that we need to protect America's national security interest. It's not a matter of presence. It's a matter of casualties. We are succeeding. We are succeeding. And I unequivocally put my career and my political fortunes on the line and unequivocally said we're going to support this surge. We're not going to talk about timetables or anything else; we're going to talk about winning and what's necessary to win. And I'm the only one that said that Rumsfeld had to go and the Petraeus strategy is the one that can succeed. That's because I have the experience, the knowledge, and the judgment. And I believe that Americans will come home with honor. And the fact is -- and the fact is that it's not American presence, because America, as the world's superpower, is going to have to be a lot of places in the world. It's how they come home. And as president, I will follow in this tradition of sticking to my principles no matter what and bring our troops home with honor. COOPER: Janet Hook from the Los Angeles Times. Janet? HOOK: OK. Governor Huckabee, we're going to shower you with questions now, OK? HUCKABEE: Well, good. I'd like to be here tonight. Thank you. (LAUGHTER) HOOK: President Bush once said he looked into the eyes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and found him to be, "very straightforward and trustworthy," and that he "got a sense of his soul." Senator McCain says he looks into Putin's eyes and he sees three letters -- KGB. When you look at President Putin, what do you see? HUCKABEE: Well, I don't know that I can read people's souls that well, and I've spent a lot of my life looking at people and talking to them. But I look at people's actions, because you can look into their eyes and their eyes can lie, but their actions don't. And when people take actions that cause us to give concern to human rights violations, to oppression -- and I don't care what their eyes are saying -- their actions are speaking a whole lot louder than their eyes ever will. And we need to be looking at what people are doing, not just what they're saying, and recognizing that our foreign policy needs to reflect an extraordinary strength. We need to make sure that the rest of the world knows that we're going to have a military that they're not wanting to engage for any purpose. And I do believe that President Reagan was right, you have peace through strength, not vulnerability. We've got to an Army that is well-staffed, well-trained, well- financed, and that is prepared for anything. And hopefully because it is so well-prepared, it never has to be used. We can't continue to have one that is stretched and pulled, and particularly -- and I'm very sensitive to this having been a governor and watched some of our National Guard troops spend three out of five years in active duty -- if we're going to engage them, we have to make sure we've got enough troop strength of regular Army and our Air Force and Navy that we don't have to have extended deployments out of our guard and reserve units. COOPER: Governor Huckabee -- excuse me -- Governor Romney, your thoughts on Vladimir Putin? ROMNEY: Well, Putin is heading down the same road that we've seen authoritarian leaders in Russia and the former Soviet Union head down before, and it's very troubling. You see a leader who wants to reestablish Russia as one of the great powers of the world, potentially a superpower, potentially the superpower. And he has -- the evidence of that, of course, is his elimination of the free press, his terrorizing and imprisoning political prisoners, and unexplained murders that are occurring. It's a -- it's another repressive regime, which he is overseeing. And the question is what do you in a circumstance like that and what it portends for the future of the world. What we have today in the world is four major, if you will, strategies at play. One, they're the nations with the energy, like Russia. They're trying to use energy as a way to take over the world. Then there's China, which is saying we're going to use communism, plus sort of a Wild West form of a free enterprise. We're going to give nuclear weapons -- or nuclear technology to the Iranians, we're going to buy oil from the Sudanese. You've got China. Then you've got al Qaeda, which says we want to bring everybody down. And then finally there's us, the only major power in the world that says we believe in free enterprise and freedom for the individual. And this great battle is going on right now, and it's essential for us to strengthen other friends like ourselves, and to confront one by one these other strategies and help turn them towards modernity so that the world our kids inherent does not have to know war. Will there be war? Of course there will always be terrible events in the world. But let's do everything in our power to keep war from occurring. Move these voices of moderation and having such strength in our own military that people never question our ability to respond. COOPER: Some questions about leadership now -- Janet Hook. HOOK: I want to start with Senator McCain. There's been a lot of discussion lately about the importance of leadership and management experience. What makes you more qualified than Mitt Romney, a successful CEO and businessman, to manage our economy? MCCAIN: Because I know how to lead. I know how to lead. I led the largest squadron in the United States Navy. And I did it out of patriotism, not for profit. And I can hire lots of managers, but leadership is a quality that people look for. And I have the vision and the knowledge and the background to take on the transcendent issue of the 21st century, which is radical Islamic extremism. I've been involved in every single major national security crisis since -- in the last 20 years. I'm proud to have played a role in those, and I'm proud to have played a role in making sure that we didn't raise the white flag and surrender in Iraq, as the Democrats wanted us to do and we would have done if we had set timetables for a withdrawal. So, the fact is -- so the fact is that I have the qualifications and the knowledge and the background and the judgment. I don't need any on-the-job training. MCCAIN: I had the great honor of serving this country in uniform for 22 years. I had the great honor of being inspired while I was in the prison camps of North Vietnam by the news of a governor and his wife who cared very much about those of us who were in captivity. And when I came home, I was inspired by him, and I voted for him, and I supported him, and I was proud to be a leader in the Reagan revolution -- I mean, a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution, as we fought these wars together with unshakable courage and principle. And I'm prepared to follow in his tradition and in his footsteps. COOPER: Governor Romney, I've got to let you in on this. Is Senator McCain a better leader in terms of the economy? ROMNEY: No. He's a fine man and a man I respect, and I particularly respect his service in the military and his integrity and courage for our nation. I do believe that as people over the centuries have considered who ought to lead our country, they don't look to senators. They look to governors. And they look to governors because they have the experience of being executive leaders. They're actually leading something. They're making something happening. They're running something. They're leading an organization. Senators and congressmen are fine people, but they're legislators. They sit in committees. They're committee chairs. And they call that leadership. In my view, the key leadership of my life was 25 years in the private sector, helping build business, turn a business around, start a business successfully, then going off to the Olympics, helping turn the Olympics around. You don't do that as a manager; you do that as a leader. We shouldn't demean the people who are starting up small businesses, or middle-sized businesses, or people who run volunteer organizations. They're leaders. You can't go out and hire managers to run these things. These are people who are leading our economy. They help lift our country. I think in order to have somebody fix our economy and strengthen it -- and it's our economy that's the root of our strength to provide for our military, for our families -- we have to have a strong economy -- you've got to have somebody who's actually done some work in the private economy, who understands how it works. COOPER: Congressman... ROMNEY: Then I went on to... (APPLAUSE) I went on to become a governor. I went on to become a governor. And as a governor, you're also a leader. You're the commander-in- chief of your National Guard. You're in charge of the state police. You're in charge, in my case, of tens of thousands of employees. You work together with the legislature to get the job done. I'm proud of my experience as a leader, and I will use that leadership skill, which has honed my sense of judgment, temperament, wisdom, decision making capacity, and ability to deliberate on tough issues to make sure you get them right, to make sure that we have the right kind of leadership in the White House. COOPER: Jim VandeHei has a follow-up question. We'll get to all of you, I promise. VANDEHEI: Let's turn that around. Even today, Rudy Giuliani endorsed John McCain and said that there would be no better commander- in-chief. What makes you more qualified than John McCain to run the military as commander-in-chief? ROMNEY: You know, I'm sure that are those who'd say, you know, to be the commander-in-chief you have to serve in the military. And one of the two great regrets I have in life is I didn't serve in the military. I'd love to have. But I don't believe that you have to have served in the military to be a great commander-in-chief or to be a great foreign policy expert. I think you're going to see in our foreign policy and in the military, we're going to face challenges not like the challenges of old, where I'd liken it to playing checkers with the red side and the black side. It's more like three-dimensional chess. And you're going to have to have people of unusual capacity in bringing in the perspectives of the entire world and thinking about how you move your pieces and how you make changes that can strengthen America's position. You see, my objective is to keep America the strongest nation on Earth, economically, militarily, and, if you will, from the spirit of our people. I believe I can do that by virtue of a lifetime of experience leading, making decisions. But, you know, some of our great leaders -- look at Abraham Lincoln, was not a military expert, but turned out to be one of the best in the history of this country. COOPER: I'm going to ask you all for follow-ups on this, but, Senator McCain, I just want to give you an opportunity to follow up on that. Is Governor Romney ready to be a military commander? MCCAIN: Oh, I'm sure that, as I say, he's a fine man. And I think he managed companies, and he bought, and he sold, and sometimes people lost their jobs. That's the nature of that business. But the fact is -- but the fact is we're at a time in our history -- we're in a time in our history where you can't afford any on-the- job training. And I believe that my experience and background qualifies me to lead. And that's why I've gotten the support of four former secretaries of state, two of them in the Reagan administration. That's why I've gotten the support of General Norman Schwarzkopf. That's why I've gotten the support of over 100 retired Army generals and admirals. Literally every national security expert from the Reagan and other administrations are supporting my candidacy, including the former head of the Department of Homeland Security, my friend, Governor Tom Ridge, who believe that I have the qualities necessary to lead. COOPER: Congressman Paul... MCCAIN: I hope that some people judge me by those that are supporting me. COOPER: Congressman Paul, what makes you capable of being a leader both on the economy and the military? PAUL: OK. The Constitution is very clear that the president is commander in chief of the military, but the president is not the commander in chief of the economy or of the people. And when we get reflection of conventional wisdom, but of a lot of lack of understanding of how the economy works. The president is not supposed to manage and run the economy. The people are supposed to do this. The government is supposed to give them sound money, low taxes, less regulation. The people are supposed to run it. But here, we're assuming that the president is supposed to run the economy. We're not supposed to manage. We're not supposed to manage the people's... COOPER: What role do you think the federal government should have -- I mean, does the federal government in your opinion have a role in stimulating the economy? PAUL: Yes, by lower taxes and less regulation. They could do a whole lot by having sound money, where we don't print the money out of thin air. That causes the business cycle. That causes your bubbles. We're always dealing with the symptoms of the disease and never saying, "how did this come about?" You know, it comes about because we have a Federal Reserve that creates money and prints it out of thin air. There is a lot of malinvestment. That's the most important thing to understand about the inflation of the monetary system, is the malinvestment. Then, later on, people suffer. You wipe out the middle class. But the evil of it all is the vehicle for financing wars that we shouldn't be in and a welfare state that we shouldn't be doing. So, yes, we have a role to play, but it's a negative role. We want the people to be free. We don't want to manage the people and tell them how to live. And we need a commander in chief. But the most important thing as a commander in chief is not moving troops around, as much as it is having a wise foreign policy that doesn't get us involved in so many things that we get trapped in and we linger year after year. We've been doing this for so long. And I like President Bush's argument that we have a humble foreign policy when he ran in 2000, and that we not be the policemen of the world. COOPER: Governor Huckabee, what makes you qualified on economic issues, on the military? HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let me say -- a while ago, you said you were going to shower me with questions, and I think then you turned the spigot off, so I want to make sure I get a little time in here to get some time. I want to just say that I agree with something that Governor Romney said. He talked about that governors are well prepared to be presidents. And I think he's right about that. And if that's the case, then I appreciate his endorsement, because I've been a governor and led a state longer than anybody running for president, Democrat or Republican. I've actually managed a government for 10 and a half years. There's something a lot of people don't think about. When you're a governor, you actually manage a microcosm of the federal government. Every agency that you have at the federal level, you have at the state level. You are familiar with the whole game board. You understand what those agencies do, because you interrelate with them as a governor every single day. But you know what the biggest frustration is? Washington doesn't understand how states operate, but states understand how Washington operates, and that's the fundamental difference. We understand, because unfunded mandates come stomping down on top of us, wrecking our state budgets, creating a complete imbalance of power, ignoring the 10th Amendment. And that's one reason that a lot of us are ready to say it's time for a new type of leadership that respects the 10th Amendment, that respects the fact that governors are out there fighting to try to build a decent education system, create jobs, make sure that we can give families a chance to have a decent way of living. And that we get governments off the backs of mothers and fathers who ought to be raising kids without a whole lot of government interference. Those are the reasons that I think when a governor gets to the White House, he does understand that leadership is about looking at all of those issues and realizing that there is no such thing as an isolated issue. Education, health care, economic development -- they're all tied together, Anderson. And this is something that I don't hear coming often from people, who, with all due respect, in the legislative branch, have the luxury of picking out particular issues that they can specialize in. Governors don't get to specialize. They have to be able to handle on any given day several dozen different issues and see how they integrate together for a strong economy, a strong sense of security. And that's how it works. COOPER: You've said repeatedly you want a presidential candidate -- or you think voters want a presidential candidate, quote, "who looks more like the guy they work with than the guy who laid them off." What exactly do you mean by that? I mean, what about leadership, ability, experience? HUCKABEE: That's exactly -- real leadership recognizes what your decisions do to people at the bottom. That's what I mean by it, Anderson. You can't have a president who sees a whole bunch of America as invisible. If you make a decision at the top and you don't understand how it affects the person all the way at the bottom, then you're not ready to lead. Leadership is about seeing the whole field. HUCKABEE: And that's what I'm talking about. And that's why -- listen, our Republican Party is going to be in trouble if we creating policies and acting like we don't understand what those folks are feeling out there waiting the tables, handling bags, driving the trucks, and moving the freight around. COOPER: We only have about four minutes left. And this is a time restriction that all the campaigns put on us. We would be happy to have this debate go on all night long, but I know everyone has a lot ahead and a lot on their plates. So this is a question that will go to each of you. Each of you has about a minute to answer. We'll start with Governor Romney. Would, and if so, why -- why would Ronald Reagan endorse you? Would Ronald Reagan endorse you? And if so, why? ROMNEY: Absolutely. Ronald Reagan would look at the issues that are being debated right here and say, one, we're going to win in Iraq, and I'm not going to walk out of Iraq until we win in Iraq. Ronald Reagan would say lower taxes. Ronald Reagan would say lower spending. Ronald Reagan would -- is pro-life. He would also say I want to have an amendment to protect marriage. Ronald Reagan would say, as I do, that Washington is broken. And like Ronald Reagan, I'd go to Washington as an outsider -- not owing favors, not lobbyists on every elbow. I would be able to be the independent outsider that Ronald Reagan was, and he brought change to Washington. Ronald Reagan would say, yes, let's drill in ANWR. Ronald Reagan would say, no way are we going to have amnesty again. Ronald Reagan saw it, it didn't work. Let's not do it again. Ronald Reagan would say no to a 50-cent-per-gallon charge on Americans for energy that the rest of the world doesn't have to pay. Ronald Reagan would have said absolutely no way to McCain- Feingold. I would be with Ronald Reagan. And this party, it has a choice, what the heart and soul of this party is going to be, and it's going to have to be in the house that Ronald Reagan built. COOPER: Your campaigns wanted this tight, so let's keep it tight. Senator McCain, would Ronald Reagan endorse you? (APPLAUSE) MCCAIN: Ronald Reagan would not approve of someone who changes their positions depending on what the year is. Ronald Reagan -- Ronald Reagan came with an unshakable set of principles, and there were many times, like when he had to deploy the (INAUDIBLE) cruise missile to Europe and there were hundreds of thousands of demonstrators against it, he stood with it. Ronald Reagan had a deal in Reykjavik that everybody wanted him to take, but he stuck with his principles. I think he knows that I stick with my principles. I put my political career on the line because I knew what would happen if we failed in Iraq. I hope that the experience I had serving as a foot soldier in his revolution would make him proud for me to continue that legacy of sticking to principle and doing what you believe in, no matter what. COOPER: Congressman Paul? (APPLAUSE) PAUL: I supported Ronald Reagan in 1976, and there were only four members of Congress that did. And also in 1980. Ronald Reagan came and campaigned for me in 1978. I'm not sure exactly what he would do right now, but I do know that he was very sympathetic to the gold standard, and he told me personally that no great nation that went off the gold standard ever remained great. And he was very, very serious about that. So he had a sound understanding about monetary policy. And for that reason, I would say look to Ronald Reagan's ideas on money because he, too, was concerned about runaway inflation and what it does to a country when you ruin the currency. And that's what's happening today. The dollar is going down and our country is going to be on the ropes if we don't reverse that trend. COOPER: Governor Huckabee? (APPLAUSE) HUCKABEE: I think it would be incredibly presumptuous and even arrogant for me to try to suggest what Ronald Reagan would do, that he would endorse any of us against the others. Let me just say this, I'm not going to pretend he would endorse me. I wish he would. I would love that, but I endorse him, and I'm going to tell you why. It wasn't just his specific policies, but Ronald Reagan was something more than just a policy wonk. He was a man who loved this country, and he inspired this country to believe in itself again. What made Ronald Reagan a great president was not just the intricacies of his policies, though they were good policies. It was that he loved America and saw it as a good nation and a great nation because of the greatness of its people. And if we can recapture that, that's when we recapture the Reagan spirit. It's that spirit that has a can-do attitude about America's futures and that makes us love our country whether we're Democrats or Republicans. And that's what I believe Ronald Reagan did -- he brought this country back together and made us believe in ourselves. And whether he believes in us, I hope we still believe in those things which made him a great leader and a great American. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Gentleman, good luck to you all. Thank you very much for attending this debate tonight. And that concludes this debate. END

Mobile World Congress rings the changesStory Highlights This year's Mobile World Congress, the biggest yet, is being held in Barcelona All major players attend to see the latest technology, network and cut deals Names include Robbie Bach, Geesung Choi, presidents of Microsoft and Samsung Also there: Nokia's Niklas Savander and Research In Motion's co-CEO Jim BalsillieNext Article in Technology » Read VIDEO By CNN anchor Adrian Finighan	BARCELONA, Spain (CNN) -- Greetings from Barcelona! Samsung president Geesung Choi shows reporters a new phone at Mobile World Congress. It could so easily have been "Greetings from Paris." The team and I made an unscheduled stop there after our flight from London was diverted when a fellow Mobile World Congress delegate fell ill somewhere over the English Channel. In all my years of flying it's the first time I've heard the ominous "Ladies and Gentlemen, is there a doctor aboard?" announcement from the flight deck. The poor chap was wheeled onto an ambulance at Charles de Gaulle and, eventually, we resumed our journey to the Catalan capital arriving several hours later than scheduled. While I wish the patient a speedy return to good health I sincerely hope that he's not reading this in his sick bed for fear that the realization he's missing such an amazing experience might trigger a relapse. The thing about the Mobile World Congress is that it's big. Very big. I am so glad that we elected to register for our press passes straight from the airport because on Monday morning the queue of journalists here to cover the event snaked right across one side of the Placa Espana, the enormous traffic island right outside the exhibition centre. For the duration of the Congress the buildings surrounding it are decked out in giant hoardings for companies like Samsung and Microsoft. There is simply too much to see and do here. Four days just won't be enough. And the place is packed with people from all over the world, from the big fish right down to the minnows of the mobile industry, from the chief execs to the tech geeks. They're here to see the latest technology, to network, cut deals and meet old friends. Don't Miss Finighan: 'iPhone killers' to die for
We're only two days in and already we've interviewed Robbie Bach, the president of Microsoft, Geesung Choi, the president of Samsung, Nokia's Niklas Savander and several of the industry's lesser-known but no less important players. A special mention too for Research In Motion's co-CEO Jim Balsillie, someone I've interviewed several times "down the line" but until yesterday had never met. He's the most un-CEO-like CEO I've ever come across. He had us all roaring with laughter and was so generous with his time and expertise. And, fingers crossed, look out for an exclusive CNN interview with Robert Redford. He's here at the Congress and I'm due to be speaking to him late Tuesday. I'll let you know how it goes when I blog again later in the week. And I'll tell you about some of the sleek new gadgets I've seen and exciting technologies on show. I can't emphasise enough just how mind boggling the Mobile World Congress is in terms of its scale and the range of products, services and innovations on show. It's a reflection of the success and rapid growth enjoyed by this particular industry. But, while you'll find most of the major players bullish about their prospects and ability to weather any economic slowdown, I would love to be able to fast forward 12 months to see just how many of the smaller players have made it through what promises to be a pretty tough year.

15 militants killed in Afghan fightingStory Highlights Coalition forces kill 15 Afghan militants in effort to stop suspected Taliban network Local government sources: At least 10 civilians killed in the operation NATO-led troops fatally shoot Afghan civilian near soldiers' base Civilian seen digging hole near base, failed to heed soldiers' warning shots Next Article in World » KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Coalition forces killed 15 armed militants and arrested another Friday in eastern Afghanistan in an operation aimed at disrupting a suspected Taliban network, according to a U.S. military statement. Local government sources said at least 10 civilians, including children, were killed in the operation. The incident occurred in Laghman province when coalition forces approached a compound of the suspected militants, according to the U.S. military. The suspects fired at coalition soldiers with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Fifteen suspects were killed in the battle, the statement said. U.S. forces, along with the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, are investigating. In an incident Thursday, an Afghan civilian was killed by NATO-led troops in southern Afghanistan. The man was seen digging a hole near the soldiers' base and did not stop digging after soldiers fired warning shots. Soldiers believed the man had an explosive device and shot and killed him. "ISAF deeply regrets all incidents where civilian casualties are caused by its actions," the military said.

Murdoch launches paper to replace disgraced tabloid
By Richard Allen Greene and Dan Rivers, CNN
updated 3:33 PM EST, Sun February 26, 2012
The Sun on Sunday hits Britain's news stands for the first time.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Sun on Sunday launches after News of the World closed in disgrace
News of the World was at the center of a hacking and bribery scandal
The Sun strikes a defensive tone talking about the scandal in its editorial
It's aiming to replace what was the best-selling paper in Britain
London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch launched a new British tabloid Sunday to replace his disgraced News of the World, seven months after the best-selling Sunday paper was shut down over a phone-hacking and bribery scandal.
The "new" newspaper isn't entirely new -- it's a Sunday edition of Murdoch's Sun tabloid, which had been a six-day-a-week paper until now.
Its leading editorial on launch day took a defensive tone in discussing the closure of the News of the World.
"The Sun has been a tremendous force for good," its editors insisted. "It is worth reminding our readers, and detractors, of that as we publish our historic first Sunday edition."
Tension high at "The Sun" newspaper
The parent company of both tabloids, News International, "closed our sister paper the News of the World over the phone hacking scandal. Since then some of our own journalists have been arrested, though not charged, over allegations of payments to public officials for stories," the editors said.
"We believe those individuals are innocent until proven guilty," they said.
The first edition of the Sunday tabloid sets a tone like that of its weekday sister, leading with the story of a television presenter's difficult childbirth and putting a scantily-clad picture of singer Kelly Rowland on page three -- a slot occupied by topless models during the week.
Nelson Mandela's hospitalization at the age of 93 makes page 8, under the headline "Nelson Tum Op" and above a picture of actress Kate Winslet in a low-cut dress accepting an acting prize.
Under Murdoch, News of the World specialized in undercover investigations and salacious stories that earned it the nickname "News of the Screws."
But revelations last year that it had paid for the hacking of voice mail messages to murder and terrorism victims and fallen troops, as well as celebrities and politicians, forced the paper to close.
Police are running three separate investigations -- into phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery -- and two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry are also probing British press practices.
Murdoch testified before one of the panels of lawmakers last year, calling it the "most humble day of his life."
A former spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, is among those arrested. No one has been charged.
The Sunday Sun launched with a print run of 3 million, far more than any daily newspaper sells in Britain, but well below the 4.75 million sales for the last issue of News of the World, according to its publisher.
News of the World was 168 years old and among the best-selling newspapers in the world when it closed.

La Raza says it's not ignoring Trayvon Martin case
By Nick Valencia, CNN
updated 10:05 PM EDT, Wed March 28, 2012
George Zimmerman, who says he killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, identifies himself as Hispanic.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Latino civil rights group criticized for silence by Rush Limbaugh
Group says Limbaugh, others are trying to divide blacks and Latinos
Spokeswoman: "The fact that George Zimmerman is Latino is irrelevant to his actions"
The killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has sparked a national dialogue on race; now CNN wants to hear from you. At 8 p.m. ET Thursday at CNN studios in New York, Soledad O'Brien is hosting a town hall meeting called "Beyond Trayvon: Race and Justice in America." The special will air at 8 p.m. ET Friday on CNN.
(CNN) -- The National Council of La Raza responded to accusations on Wednesday by critics such as conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh that the civil rights organization has not been vocal enough during the Trayvon Martin controversy.
"We really regret people trying to use this to divide blacks and Latinos," said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. "It's disturbing to us that Rush Limbaugh has this theory. The only time he apparently cares about what happens to a Latino is when they may have happened to kill a young African-American man."
In response to a caller on his radio program on Tuesday, Limbaugh suggested La Raza, the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States, has not stood behind Zimmerman after it was publicized that he identified himself as Hispanic.
"You know, that's an interesting point," Limbaugh said in response to his caller. "You're right. I haven't heard a word from La Raza about this."
Was Trayvon shooting racially motivated?

Outcry mounts; answers sparse
Limbaugh went on to criticize the group's president, Janet Murguia, for not referencing Zimmerman as Hispanic in her sole commentary on the Trayvon Martin incident, which was released on March 22.
"The fact that George Zimmerman is Latino is irrelevant to his actions," Navarette, who is an adviser to Murguia, said in response to the criticism. "Personally that's the media's fault. Everything has to fit into a narrative and a paradigm. Initially it was a white guy who shot a black kid. Now they've split the difference," she said.
What the witnesses are saying
"Unfortunately, being Hispanic does not mean that you aren't capable of bigotry or discrimination," Navarette said. "It does not condone or preclude him (Zimmerman) from having acted in a discriminatory manner."
As for why La Raza has not been more vocal about the incident, Navarette said behind the scenes the group has been showing its support since the beginning, despite the perceived tensions between blacks and Latinos.
Evolution of the hoodie
Although La Raza has been largely out of the spotlight during the controversy, other Latino groups have stepped up to show their support. On March 20, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus released a statement asking for the Department of Justice to pursue the matter as a federal hate crime.
"The Department of Justice is sending a message to the Martin family and to communities of color that our children's lives have value and deserve equal protection under the law," said Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-Texas, leader of the caucus.
In Orlando, Navarette said one of the first people to reach out to the Martin family lawyer was Marytza Sanz, who is affiliated with La Raza and runs a Latino leadership nonprofit near Sanford.
"Look, there are tensions between our two communities, but it would be a further injustice if this incident was used to further that," she said. "We've been in touch with Rev. Al Sharpton and Ben Jealous at the NAACP, and as this continues we've offered our support to them."
La Raza said it supports the Department of Justice decision to "rectify this situation" and said the group is waiting for "all the facts to come out" before it makes further comments.
"We're very supportive of accountability," Navarette added. "There's no question that there's a lot more to this than the police initially thought."

Wisconsin gunman's Army base had white supremacists
By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 7:23 PM EDT, Wed August 8, 2012
Wisconsin shooter Wade Michael Page had ties to white supremacist groups.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Three Fort Bragg soldiers were convicted in a 1995 racial killing
Wade Michael Page served at Fort Bragg from 1995 to 1998
Criminologist: Page "really started getting into" neo-Nazi ideology in the military (CNN) -- When Wisconsin temple gunman Wade Michael Page arrived at Fort Bragg in 1995, the sprawling Army base in North Carolina already was home to a small number of white supremacists including three soldiers later convicted in the murder of an African-American couple.
The killings launched a military investigation that tightened regulations against extremist activity, but some say such influences persist in today's armed forces.
"Outside every major military installation, you will have at least two or three active neo-Nazi organizations actively trying to recruit on-duty personnel," said T.J. Leyden, a former white power skinhead in the U.S. Marines who now conducts anti-extremism training.
'Swimming upstream,' white supremacist groups still strong
Page died in a shootout with police responding to his attack Sunday on a Sikh temple in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek that killed six people and wounded four, including a police officer.

He had ties to white supremacist groups and the FBI acknowledges it knew of him, though no formal investigation ever took place.
According to Pete Simi, a University of Nebraska criminologist who knew Page, the military experience at Fort Bragg helped instill Page's allegiance to the white power movement.
"What he told me during the course of our time together was that he really started to identify with the neo-Nazism during his time in the military," said Simi, who met Page in 2001 while doing a study on white power groups in California. "And specifically, what he told me at one point was that, if you join the military and you're not a racist, then you certainly will be by the time you leave."
In particular, Simi told CNN, Page's military experience bolstered his perception that "the deck was stacked against whites."
"He came to feel that there was preferential treatment for African-Americans in the military and whites were always on the short end of the stick," Simi continued. "And the more he got into the Nazi ideology, the more he came to see all of society in that way."
While Page knew about neo-Nazis and racist skinheads before joining the Army, "he really started getting into it during his time in the military," said Simi, author of "American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate."
Opinion: Hate with a beat -- White power music
Page joined the Army in 1992 and ended up at Fort Bragg in 1995, around the time that the base became the focus of white extremism in the military when three members of the 82nd Airborne Division stationed there were arrested in connection with the murder of an African-American couple in nearby Fayetteville.
Investigators found neo-Nazi materials in the barracks of the men, and all three were eventually convicted. The case prompted a military review that determined 22 soldiers at the base had past or present links to skinhead groups, though investigators concluded there was no organized extremist movement operating among the more than 14,000 troops of the 82nd Airborne at the time.
Those who served with Page say he showed racist tendencies then.
"He was involved with white supremacy. He talked about the racial holy war a lot," said Chris Robillard, who met Page at Fort Bragg in 1995 when both were doing psychological operations training.
While describing Page as a close friend and a kind person, Robillard also said that "when he'd rant, it would be about mostly any non-white person."
"I know everyone is going to paint him as a racist with hatred, but that's not how I remember him," Robillard said. "The racial holy war talk I always took as something he would vent about, and not act on it. I never pictured him as someone who would do anything. I thought maybe he was just saying it for attention."
To J.M. Berger, a counterterrorism analyst and editor for IntelWire.Com, the military attracts extremists because of the weapons training it provides.
"One thing that we really have to keep in mind is that extremists are often explicitly interested in joining the military because they get training that they can use later," Berger told CNN, adding that "there have been some explicit discussions among leaders of some of these groups that their followers should join the Army to get trained."
In talking to military veterans, Berger said, he hears "different things from different people."
"Some say that there's not a massive problem. Others have expressed concern to me about what they've seen in the ranks," he continued. "And, you know, the military is a massive operation like the U.S. population. There are going to be some people who are problems."
Temple killings put spotlight on 'hate rock' Page received a general discharge under honorable conditions from the Army in 1998 due to "discreditable incidents," according to a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of not being identified.
Robillard said Page showed up drunk for duty one morning, which led to his eventual discharge. The two men parted ways until 2000, when Page visited Robillard at his home in Arkansas.
"He had gone through a dramatic change," Robillard said of the meeting, the last time he saw Page in person. "His talk about the racist war was ... more like he really did believe it."
Leyden, the former white supremacist who wrote the book "Skinhead Confessions: From Hate to Hope," said he openly displayed his extremist leanings while serving in the Marine Corps in the late 1980s.
"I used to hang a swastika flag on my wall locker and everybody in my unit all the way up to my commander knew it," he said. "The only time they ever asked me to take it down was when the commanding general would come through, just so they wouldn't get in trouble. And afterwards, I would put it right back up and they were perfectly fine with it."
He noted that his brother's unit had less tolerance for such displays.
"His commanding officer went to the barracks and anything that was racist or seemed to be racist, he made them send it home," Leyden said. "So it really depends on the commanding officers and who's in charge of that base."
After the 1995 murder case involving the three Fort Bragg soldiers, the Army appointed a task force to investigate the extent of white supremacists in its ranks and also started including training against extremism.
White supremacist group member pleads guilty
According to the Department of Defense website, the task force visited 28 installations and interviewed more than 7,500 soldiers. It found that less than 1% said they had seen soldiers or civilian employees involved with extremist groups.
A decade later, the Southern Law Poverty Center reported in 2006 that some high-profile members of extremist groups were serving in the U.S. military.
According to the organization, which tracks hate groups in the United States, the presence of extremists in the military increased with the need to bolster ranks for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Rothkopf: Debate may end up between two versions of Obama's foreign policy
He says recent turmoil has taken shine off his accomplishments; record will be questioned
He says Obama got bin Laden, managed Libya, ended Iraq war, Afghanistan ending soon
Rothkopf: Romney will hit on unstable Mideast, Israel, but his own plan must be questioned
Editor's note: David Rothkopf is CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group, publishers of Foreign Policy magazine, and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
(CNN) -- For the presidential campaign's main event Monay night, the billing should be changed to read Obama vs. Obama. Because at its heart, the climactic face-off between the candidates may end up being a confrontation between two versions of the president, good Obama and bad Obama, the foreign policy master versus the man who leads from behind when he leads at all.
Obama will no doubt try to reinforce foreign-policy campaign themes that his supporters feel are among his strongest credentials. But Mitt Romney will almost certainly try to lay out the narrative that Obama has weakened America and left it more vulnerable.
David Rothkopf
That there could even be a meaningful debate over foreign policy in the campaign seemed unlikely until relatively recently. Just a couple of months ago, it was widely assumed that this president had done the impossible and inoculated himself against a traditional GOP line of attack against Democrats.
Republicans have over the past several decades sought to present themselves as the party of foreign policy competence and national strength.

They have sought to portray Democrats as weak, anti-military and too inclined toward multilateralist mumbo jumbo, foreign policy approaches that give too much influence to allies, rivals ... foreigners. Furthermore, Romney had gotten off to a bad start on foreign policy mixing gaffes with blunt-instrument policy proposals that sounded like a neocon greatest hits album.
But in the past few months, several fissures have opened up in the strong facade of the administration's foreign policy. Syria has festered. The Iran nuclear standoff has re-entered the spotlight -- most recently this weekend with the curiously timed revelation that was later even more curiously denied by all involved concerning the possibility of opening new talks between the U.S. and Iran.
Relations with Israel soured, and both sides had to scramble to limit the damage. The situation on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan has deteriorated. And then there was Benghazi.

Not only were the murders of the U.S. ambassador and three others a tragedy that raised questions about diplomatic security and the administration's candor, the attack had another important political consequence.
By far the most resonant of the president's foreign policy achievements was the killing of Osama bin Laden. But that achievement is only of something more than emotional significance if it also supported the administration's argument that they had dramatically weakened al Qaeda, the extremist threat in general and thus made Americans safer. But Benghazi provided palpable evidence that terrorists targeting Americans and our allies were still a reality and in fact, were morphing into new, dangerous forms across the Middle East.
Combined with the continuing violence by the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan and by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, it is hard to make the case that the threat has been reduced even if, as is undoubtedly true, the Obama administration has been extremely effective in decapitating and dismantling much of al Qaeda's leadership structure it had targeted in the AfPak region.
Certainly the president, who was re-energized in the second debate and in speeches since Denver, will forcefully reiterate his considerable achievements on the international front. He ended America's long, costly and damaging involvement in Iraq. He has America on track to exit Afghanistan by 2014. He not only got bin Laden, but the U.S. military and intelligence community under his leadership also got a broad array of top al Qaeda lieutenants, such as Anwar al-Awlaki, and Moammar Gadhafi.
In Libya, he found a way to engineer its dictator's ouster in collaboration with our allies and without sending American troops. He oversaw a restoration of America's reputation after the excesses of George W. Bush's "war on terror." He oversaw a successful foreign policy team led by a widely admired secretary of state. He recognized and prioritized finding a way to deal with the rise of new powers. His Cairo speech was a remarkable act of outreach to the Muslim world. His Prague speech committing the U.S. to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons was inspiring.
Wonks admired his national security process. The public admired his steely cool and decisiveness. His Obama doctrine of fighting terror and enemies such as Iran through the use of covert means, cyberwarfare, special operations and unmanned drone operations seemed a more cost-effective, sound alternative to shock and awe.
The Romney team, however, sees an opportunity to offer another credible narrative. It is that the administration has frequently dithered -- in its convoluted and unsatisfying Afghanistan process and in responding to Iran's "Green Revolution" and the Arab Spring.
Fareed's Take
Previewing the presidential debate
Candidates prepare for final debate
Romney's CEO take on foreign affairs
It is certainly hard to argue that the Middle East today is safer or more stable than it was four years ago, or that our enemies are weaker. Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon. Terrorists are active. Unrest and uncertainty threaten key allies from Egypt to Jordan. Yemen teeters. The Israel-Iran face-off is more dangerous than ever. Syria's war rages on, innocents die and it threatens to ignite other regional conflicts.
Iraq's U.S.-backed leaders are now aiding our Iranian enemies in their support of Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Iraq itself is more fragmented than ever. In Afghanistan, our allies increasingly act like enemies, and the possibility of social and political chaos after our departure is high. Europe's economy is in tatters, and we have been sidelined in those discussions. Cyberthreats threaten from East and West. China grows more influential. Russia continues to confound our plans despite our vaunted "reset." And the U.S. seems no closer to solving the long-term economic problems that remain the biggest threats to its strength.
Fortunately for Obama, this is a two-way race and thus only two narratives will compete on that stage.
Because there is a third critique of his foreign policy that he will not hear on Monday: one from the left. That one is troubled by his serial violation of the sovereignty of other nations, his "kill lists" and use of drones and cyberattacks in defiance of international law, near-abandonment of the G20 as a fairer mechanism for coordinating global initiatives and his failures on battling climate change and reforming financial markets.
More than all of these, the greatest critique from the left centers on the president's ill-considered decision to "double down" in Afghanistan for apparently political rather than long-term national security reasons.
The foreign policy debate will be much, much more central to determining Obama's fate than anyone could have predicted just weeks ago.It could well focus more attention on his undeniable missteps than on his differences with Romney. That would be a pity, because the American people would also benefit from a thorough airing of Romney's truly dubious foreign-policy proposals, such as increasing defense spending that we can't afford and don't need, and substituting nostalgia for foreign policy, favoring feel-good platitudes of the Ronald Reagan era over the new thinking needed in a dramatically different world.
The president would be wise, therefore, to ensure that Romney, too, is a subject of Monday's conversation.

Protesters in Ireland rally for abortion rights
From Bridget Fallon, For CNN
updated 10:57 PM EST, Sat November 17, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Strict laws are under fire after the death of a woman who was refused an abortion
"Never again, never again," protesters chant in the Irish capital
The Irish government has said it will investigate Halappanavar's death
Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Dublin on Saturday to remember a woman who died after being refused an abortion and to demand a change to the country's laws.
Savita Halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital on October 21 complaining of back pain. She was 17 weeks pregnant at the time.
The doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but denied her an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband has said. Halappanavar died of septicemia, or a blood infection, at the hospital.
Chanting "never again, never again" protesters marched to government buildings and held a candlelit vigil in Dublin.
Vigils were also held other cities, including Galway, where Halappanavar died, and outside the Irish Embassy in London.
Savita Halappanavar, 31, died of septicemia, or a blood infection, at a hospital in Galway.
"I'm here today to stand up for women's rights. And I think the government should legislate and stop messing around," said Patrick O'Neill, a protester.
Abortions laws in Ireland are strict and terminations can only carried out in exceptional circumstances.
Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never been enacted into law, meaning there is little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion can and can't take place.
It is this Supreme Court ruling that some Irish people now want made into law.
Gerry Adams, leader of Ireland's Sinn Fein political party, has said it's time for the government to legislate for abortion in certain medical cases.
Other politicians have called called for an investigation into Halappanavar's death.
Her death is "particularly tragic and harrowing, and shocking to all concerned," said Irish opposition lawmaker Micheal Martin.
He has called for an independent inquiry into the case "with personnel from outside the country to participate on such a panel of inquiry."
The Irish government needs to "establish the full circumstances" of her death, he said.
The government has said it will launch an investigation, but details, including who will lead it, remain elusive. The government has said it will include the Halappanavar family in the inquiry.
The hospital expressed sympathy to Halappanavar's husband, and noted in a statement that "the facts of this tragic case have yet to be established."
The hospital is conducting a review of the incident, as it does will all unexpected deaths. The Galway Roscommon University Hospitals Group released a statement saying, "In the case of a sudden maternal death, these procedures are followed: notification of the death to the coroner; notification of the death to the HSE's National Incident Management Team; the completion of a maternal death notification form. These national procedures are being followed by Galway University Hospital."

Russia's Putin signs anti-U.S. adoption bill
By CNN Staff
updated 10:03 PM EST, Fri December 28, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Russian lawmaker pushes for exception for children with disabilities
Measure bans the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families effective January 1
Russian leader's action could affect hundreds of American families seeking to adopt
Rights groups criticized the bill, which some say is retaliation for U.S. act against rights abusers
(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law on Friday a measure that bans the adoption the Russian children by U.S. families effective January 1.
The action could affect hundreds of U.S. families seeking to adopt. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures.

Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third-most-popular country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. citizens to adopt.
The U.S. State Department said it "deeply regrets" the law announced by the Kremlin.
"The Russian government's politically motivated decision will reduce adoption possibilities for children who are now under institutional care," it said in a statement. "We are further concerned about statements that adoptions already underway may be stopped and hope that the Russian government would allow those children who have already met and bonded with their future parent to finish the necessary legal procedures so that they can join their families."
The announcement was a wrenching one for Aaron and Jenny Moyer, coming in an adoption process that was well under way for them to become parents of a Russian orphan named Vitali. They carry photographs of them and Vitali together during their visits to Russia.
"He's our son," Aaron Moyer said. "In our hearts, he is our son."
Jenny Moyer says she knows there is an orphan crisis in Russia, especially for children with special needs. Vitali has Down syndrome.
The fact that he has the genetic condition associated with mental retardation may prove to be a help. A Russian parliamentarian, Robert Shlegel, was to submit an amendment that would allow U.S. citizens to adopt Russian children with disabilities, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency.
The couple, who have two biological children and one adopted American child, said they are relying on their faith to see them through the uncertainty.
"We want not just our son, but all the kids over there to have families and to grow up and know the love of a mom and dad," Aaron Moyer said.
iReporter says she's devastated by the news
The Russian measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, Russia's semiofficial RIA-Novosti news agency said.
And it imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights.
The law envisions the drafting of a list of U.S. citizens who will be prohibited from entering Russia, and will suspend the activity of any legal entities controlled by them in the country.

The vote this week in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house, was unanimous, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov criticized the bill ahead of its signing.
Lawmakers in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, adopted it last week.
The move is widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed on December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia.
The Magnitsky Act is named for Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky died in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death.
The Russian bill's implementation nullifies a recent agreement between the United States and Russia in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions.
Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of adopted Russian children since the 1990s.
The Russian public has supported the bill, with 56% of respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) saying they backed the ban, RIA Novosti reported.
In 2010, an American woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety.
Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special representative for human rights, said Wednesday on Twitter that Russians were "well aware of, and have pointed out more than once, the inadequate protection of adopted Russian children in the U.S." He also said the United States is one of three nations that have not signed the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.
According to the U.N. Children's Fund, the United States is one of two nations -- the other being Somalia -- that has not ratified the convention. But the United States has signed the convention, thereby signaling its intent to ratify.
Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, touted the importance of "inter-country adoption."
"While welcoming Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev's call for the improvement of the child welfare system, UNICEF urges that the current plight of the many Russian children in institutions receives priority attention," he said.
He asked that Russia let children's "best interests" guide the "design and development of all efforts to protect children."
Groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had urged Russian lawmakers to reject the bill.
"This bill hits back at Russia's most vulnerable children and could deprive them of the loving families they desperately need," Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said last week.
John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, has said that "this bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act."
CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Alla Eshchenko, Brian Walker and Samira Said contributed to this report.

At least 37 hostages killed in Algeria gas plant standoff, prime minister says
From Amir Ahmed, CNN updated 12:18 PM EST, Wed January 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The daughter of a Texas man killed says he was a "wonderful" father and person
In addition to 37 confirmed dead, 5 hostages are unaccounted for, Algeria's leader says 7 Japanese, 6 Filipinos, 3 Britons and 3 Americans are among those killed, officials say
An Algerian official says the gas plant will reopen and foreign workers will return (CNN) -- At least 37 hostages died in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in eastern Algeria and the subsequent special forces assaults on it, the country's prime minister said Monday.
Five other hostages are missing from the In Amenas complex and could be dead, Prime Minister Abdul Malek Sallal said.

Before Sallal's statement, officials from other countries and companies that employed foreign workers at the sprawling plant had confirmed 29 hostage deaths.
Seven of the 37 confirmed dead haven't been identified yet, according to the prime minister. Those who have been identified include seven Japanese, six Filipinos, three Americans, three Britons and one Algerian, officials from those countries said.
Some 29 militants also died, while three were captured, Sallal said, according to the state-run Algerian Press Service. The standoff ended Saturday, after four days, when Algerian special forces stormed the complex for the second time. The government said it did so because the militants were planning to blow up the installation and flee to neighboring Mali with hostages.

"If it exploded, it could have killed and destroyed anything within 5 kilometers or further," Sallal said.

Militant says Mali unrest spurred assault; others say it followed ample planning
The crisis began Wednesday when Islamist extremists in pickup trucks struck the natural gas complex some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the Libyan border, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up.
After taking over, the well-armed militants planted explosives throughout the complex, Sallal said. They came from eight countries: Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, Niger, Canada and Mauritania.
Algeria's military talked with the militants, but their demands that prisoners in the North African nation be released were deemed unreasonable, according to the prime minister. The country's special forces waged the assaults to free the hostages and were backed by the Algerian Air Force.

At one point, the militants tried to flee the compound in vehicles that carried explosives and three or four hostages as human shields, Sallal said. At least two of the vehicles flipped and exploded during the attempt, he said.
Sallal said the terrorists had entered the country from northern Mali, where Malian and French authorities are battling Islamist rebels.
One-eyed veteran Islamist fighter Moktar Belmoktar has claimed responsibility for the hostage-taking on behalf of his al Qaeda-linked group, according to Mauritania's Sahara Media news agency.
Belmokhtar -- who was among 12 defendants, five like him still on the run, who were the subject of an Algerian court hearing Monday related to their terrorist involvement -- said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali.
But regional analysts believe the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned so quickly, and Sallal said the hostage scheme had been hatched over months.
Algerian minister says gas plant will restart, foreign workers will return
The targeted gas facility is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP. Some 790 people worked there, including 134 foreign workers, Algeria's prime minister said.
Read more: Algerian forces seek 'peaceful' settlement of dramatic, deadly hostage crisis
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday the effort to evacuate workers is complete and that U.K. officials are now focused on bringing the bodies of slain British hostages back home.
Cameron praised Algerian forces for their work in ending the crisis, despite concerns from some nations earlier that the Algerians had unnecessarily put hostages at greater risk.
"This would have been a most-demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world, and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the Algerians in undertaking it," the British leader said. "The responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the terrorists."
Such Islamist militant activity is not new to Africa, including recent violence in Mali and Somalia.
Algeria's status as Africa's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of the product to Europe heightens its importance to those who want to invest there. That interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals, and their business ventures, are safe.
Energy and Mining Minister Youcef Yousfi, who a day earlier insisted Algeria can keep its gas facilities secure without foreign forces' help, said he believes the targeted gas facility will be back running "in the shortest possible time" and that foreign workers will soon return. Several foreign companies, including Statoil and BP, evacuated their workers from Algeria after the incident.
"I don't think that these workers have left definitively Algeria," Yousfi told reporters, according to the Algerian Press Service. "Maybe some left ... to reassure their families, but I want to ensure that no company or no worker permanently left the country."
Nations mourn dead, try to account for others
Here is a breakdown on the status of hostages from around the world who were involved in the crisis:
Colombia
Colombia's president said one of its citizens is presumed dead.
France
No known French hostages are unaccounted for, the defense ministry said.
A man identified as Yann Desjeux died after telling French newspaper Sud Ouest that he and 34 other hostages were treated well. It was unclear what led to his death.
Japan
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Minoru Kiuchi and officials from JGC, a Yokohama-based engineering firm, saw and identified the bodies of seven Japanese citizens killed in the crisis, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga announced late Monday.
Three Japanese remain unaccounted for, according to Suga.
Malaysia
Three hostages were on their way back home, state media reported. There is a "worrying possibility" that another is dead while a fifth is unaccounted for, the agency said.

Norway
Five Norwegians are missing, while eight are safe, according to Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg.
Philippines
Six Filipinos are confirmed dead and four are missing, the nation's foreign affairs ministry said. In addition, 16 Filipinos are alive and accounted for, according to a ministry spokesman.
Romania
One Romanian lost his life while four others were freed, the country's foreign ministry said.
United Kingdom
Three British citizens were killed, the Foreign Office said Sunday. Three other British nationals and a UK resident are also "believed dead," according to British officials. The Foreign Office confirmed the name of one slain hostage, Garry Barlow, in a statement Monday.
"Garry was a loving, devoted family man, he loved life and lived it to the full. He was very much loved by myself, his sons, mother and sister and the rest of his family and friends and will be greatly missed," the Foreign Office quoted his wife, Lorraine, as saying.
Twenty-two other Britons who were taken hostage have safely returned home.
United States
U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland on Monday said three Americans had been killed and identified them as Victor Lynn Lovelady, Gordon Lee Rowan and Frederick Buttaccio, who had been previously identified.
Seven U.S. citizens survived the crisis, added Nuland, who declined to comment further citing privacy considerations.
Erin Lovelady described her father Victor, of Nederland, Texas, as a laid-back, understanding and loving man.
"I want people to understand how wonderful my dad was, and how great a dad he was, and how much he's going to be missed by me and my mother and my brother," Erin Lovelady told CNN affiliate KFDM, describing herself as "daddy's little girl."
Gwen Eckholm called Rowan -- her former neighbor in Mesa, Arizona, who recently moved to eastern Oregon -- a "very intelligent, super-nice guy" who told her he felt safe working in Algeria.
He said "we're in a compound in the middle of nowhere, and we've got security, and I'll be fine," Eckholm told CNN affiliate KNXV. "I guess you can't really be secure any place."

'I am the shooter,' Nidal Hasan tells Fort Hood court-martial By Josh Rubin and Matt Smith, CNN
updated 6:44 PM EDT, Tue August 6, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A "state of panic" erupted when the shooting began, survivor says
NEW: Hasan kept shooting outside the processing center, witness says
"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter," Hasan admits Hasan launched a "jihad" against his comrades, prosecutors said
Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- "I am the shooter."
Maj. Nidal Hasan made that blunt declaration Tuesday at the outset of his court-martial in the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood. The Army psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 and wounding 32 at a processing center for soldiers heading into combat zones overseas.
"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter," Hasan told the panel of 13 senior officers who will decide his fate. "The evidence presented with this trial will show one side. The evidence will also show that I was on the wrong side. I then switched sides."
But the declaration wasn't exactly news to now-retired Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who was shot seven times that November day. Lunsford, the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan, recounted how the now-admitted gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, pulled out a pistol and began shooting.
"It was a state of panic," Lunsford said. A civilian doctor, Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots.
As Lunsford was checking behind him, "Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me," he said. "He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head."
A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified.
Hasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.

What to expect at Ft. Hood trial
What is a court-martial?
A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a "progressive radicalization," giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime.
Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed "that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible," said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case.
Investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said.
Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions
At the outset of his assault, Hasan cried out "Allahu Akbar ... and starts shooting at the soldiers sitting defenseless in chairs," Mulligan said.
Internet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like "terrorist killing," "innocent," "Quran," "fatwas" and "suicide bombings," Mulligan said.
Hasan is representing himself in his court-martial and could be sentenced to death if found guilty. As his own attorney, he'll be cross-examining witnesses -- perhaps including some of those he has now admitted shooting. He did not cross-examine Lunsford, however.
He told the panel in his opening statement, "We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion." But, he added, "I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor."
Hasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011.
The case was first set to begin in March 2012, but it has been delayed repeatedly -- notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved.
Other soldier on soldier attacks
Among others scheduled to testify include Chief Warrant Officer Christopher Royal, who survived the shootings with two bullet wounds to his back. The slugs left him with nerve damage that numbs his left arm and leg and sends streaking pains "shooting up and down my back."
It's also left invisible scars as well -- post-traumatic stress that has hurt his ability to perform his duties as a computer specialist and left him unable to feel safe in his own country.
"I really feel more comfortable downrange. I really do," said Royal, who served in Iraq four times and in Afghanistan once. "I think I would be more comfortable living in Iraq right now than living in the United States."
Royal escaped the gunfire only to go back into the processing center in an attempt to tackle Hasan.
"I had escaped without being wounded," Royal said. "I got ... in the parking lot, and then I said, 'I can't let him get away with this.' And I wasn't even thinking that I didn't have a weapon. I just knew that I couldn't let him get away."
Lunsford said Tuesday he encountered Royal outside the building.
"I ask him, 'Am I out of the building yet?' He says I am, and to play dead," Lunsford testified.
Josh Rubin reported from Fort Hood. CNN's Jason Morris contributed to this report.

Budget deal remains stalled over teacher funding issue - November 8, 1999
Budget deal remains stalled over teacher funding issue
November 8, 1999
Web posted at: 6:20 p.m. EST (2320 GMT)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An overall federal budget agreement between congressional Republicans and the White House remains stalled over several key measures, including money the Clinton Administration wants to fund 100,000 new teachers.
President Bill Clinton said Monday that Republicans agreed to fund new teachers last year. But Clinton said the Republicans have "mysteriously changed" their position and now want to use the money as block grants to the states, which he said could be used for voucher programs for private schools.
"The Republicans felt strongly about it when they were facing an election and I think it's wrong for them to abandon a commitment the next year that they were proud of in an election year, so I hope we can work that out," he said.
The funding for teachers is aimed at reducing class sizes in the early grades. Clinton touted a study that said reduced class sizes helps students, saying teachers, educators and evidence support the idea that reduced classes sizes help students.
"Our taxpayer money should go for more teachers and smaller classes in our public schools, not for vouchers for private schools," he said.
Republicans are proposing to spend more than the White House on education, but they want local school districts to control the money.
"We feel that flexibility should be allowed for local teachers and administrators to decide whether that money needs to go just for teachers or can it be used for individuals with disabilities ... or for computers or roof repairs," said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
Another Republican senator said that Congress is not going to give in easily to White House budget demands. "If we give up the power of the purse, which is what is at issue here, then it really reduces the Congress to the state of being a eunuch," said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pennsylvania). "So that's a fairly sticky point. I've checked with the leadership, and I think that there's going to be a fair-sized battle here.
Clinton also pushed for other White House priorities, including money for more 50,000 police officers, the payment of the country's United Nation's dues, an environmental program that would set aside more areas for protection, pass a federal hate crimes bill and a bill raising the minimum wage.
White House and congressional budget negotiators met privately Sunday night on Capitol Hill. The talks began early Sunday afternoon, as Jack Lew, the head of the White House budget office, and members of the Senate Appropriations Committee took up their differences on spending bills covering funding for the environment, law enforcement and education.
Sunday's meeting was the first time both sides met officially to discuss the remaining spending bills, so there was little expectation of a full agreement Sunday night, Republican congressional aides said. Disputes remain over four of the 13 annual spending bills for the current fiscal year, funding seven Cabinet departments and other, smaller agencies. A fifth measure dealing with the District of Columbia's budget is all but finished.
Negotiators said Republicans came closer to the White House position with an offer of an additional $338 million for the Interior Department and land programs. Democrats countered with a request for about $140 million over
the GOP offer.
The federal government is currently running on borrowed time.
The 2000 fiscal year began October 1. Since then, Congress has been funding government by passing budget extensions which keep the doors of government offices open. The current extension expires Wednesday.
The GOP proposes a 1 percent, across-the-board spending cut to balance the budget without touching the Social Security surplus. The White House continues to say any such cut is unacceptable, but Lott said Republicans would keep their promise not to touch the Social Security surplus.
"We're not going to dip into the trust fund, the way it's been done for the past 16 years or so," Lott (R-Mississippi) told "Fox News Sunday."
White House Chief of Staff John Podesta told NBC's "Meet the Press" there can be no deal without a commitment to hire 100,000 new teachers.
"Realistically, I think we are not prepared to go home until we do get more teachers and lower class sizes," Podesta said.
Podesta said the White House has two other priorities it will fight for -- getting money to hire 50,000 police officers and pay the back dues the United States owes the United Nations.
Some members of the GOP-controlled Congress want to attach conditions to the dues.
"I think the president has to do some compromising here, not just the House," said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).
Democrats warn, however, that U.S. influence in the world would be reduced without an agreement.
"After the end of this month, which is November, we lose our vote in the general assembly of the United Nations," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, (D-California). "I for one think that is a major problem hanging out there, and I believe this president is going to be very tough and want closure on that issue," she told CNN's "Late Edition."
The possibility that either Congress or the White House might block another budget extension, shutting down the government as a way to influence negotiations appears unlikely. CNN's Bob Franken and Kelly Wallace contributed to this report.

Is Cisco choking broadband pipes?

by Elizabeth Wasserman WASHINGTON (IDG) -- As Cisco Systems helps build broadband Internet access through the nation's cable systems, the company isn't just dreaming about giving cable companies a way to speed access to certain Web sites and slow access to others. They're bragging about it. Marketing materials from Cisco Systems, one of the leading suppliers of Internet networking equipment for the cable industry, touts the company's ability to restrict or slow consumers from reaching the Web sites of their choice while speeding along those headed to others. Cisco's technology, the documents say, "could promote and offer your own or partners' services with full-speed features to encourage adoption of your services." At the same time, the material says the equipment can "restrict" incoming content and "subscribers' outgoing access" to "discourage its use." The revelation came to light among documents presented to the Federal Communications Commission by several prominent consumer groups that seek to mandate open access to the nation's cable systems. The groups -- including the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Media Access Project and the Center for Media Education -- are calling for regulations to open cable systems to competition from Internet service providers, or ISPs.

Computerworld Minute In response, Cisco issued a statement saying that the company "makes this technology available to everybody. This technology is consistent with Cisco's open-standard philosophy and commitment to competition in the marketplace. This technology was designed with customers in mind who clearly want tools to protect against offensive content, such as hate and obscene materials." But giving such technology to the cable companies creates an uneasy situation whereby they could potentially control both access and content for their online subscribers. In the cable television industry now, companies do control both access and content via channels -- a paradigm the consumers group don't want to repeat with broadband Internet access. "This is the owner's manual that they're providing to the cable industry to monopolize the Internet," Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education, said in an interview. Chester said he found the Cisco marketing materials earlier this summer while strolling through the convention of the National Cable Television Association in Chicago. The prospect of screening access comes amid a growing national debate about whether cable broadband networks should be opened to competitive Internet service providers. The cable industry, which is spending billions of dollars rolling out these services, has so far avoided regulation of its networks, which now reach about one million customers nationwide. In the meantime, the issue has been taken up in some cities and counties across the nation, spurred on by the concerns of America Online and other ISPs, which complain that they won't be able to reach cable Internet customers. Only Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla., have so far called for regulation. Those rulings are being appealed by cable operators, with AT&T taking a lead role. The FCC, which asserts that it has jurisdiction of the issue on a national basis, has been monitoring the debate but has so far taken a "hands-off" approach, with agency officials preferring to allow the market to determine what happens. "The FCC has the same goal as consumers and consumer groups," said FCC Cable Services Bureau Chief Deborah Lathen in a statement released Wednesday. "We want open access. Where we diverge is how to get there." Lathen said that the Internet economy has generated over $300 billion in revenue in the United States in the past year because its development has been driven by market forces. "The FCC has played an important role by creating a deregulatory environment in which the Internet could prosper." But in a letter presented Thursday to FCC Chairman William Kennard, the consumer groups charged that the failure to require open networks threatens the future of the Internet. The letter says that granting cable operators the right to exclude ISPs "would strip the Internet of the very qualities that have made it one of the most powerful vehicles for free expression and economic growth." A spokesman for AT&T, Jim McGann, said he was unsure whether any company officials had seen the marketing materials or if the cable operations that AT&T is acquiring, including Tele-Communications Inc. and MediaOne Group, even use the Cisco products. He reiterated the company's position that it would not seek to control access to content on the Internet. "AT&T has every incentive to make content available on the Internet to everyone," McGann said. "We have no incentive to restrict any content. For them to use this as another vehicle to say 'The sky is falling and we must do something' is a little far-fetched. The correct policy is what the commission has adopted. Keep regulation out of Internet."
