WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said Thursday that the Pentagon has received reports that Iraqi forces have set "as many as three or four" oil wells ablaze in southern Iraq, near the Kuwaiti border.
"We are attempting to get additional information on that," he said at a Pentagon briefing.
Pentagon officials told CNN the fires are at well heads and not in oil-filled trenches.
Plumes are visible in satellite images taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which the agency describes as "consistent with NOAA's experience in detecting oil fires in the past from satellites in space."
"In addition, these plumes have been co-located as being consistent with where oil wells are known to exist," NOAA said in a press release.
The images were produced from data taken Thursday at 5:05 a.m. EST by the NOAA-16 satellite, a polar-orbiting satellite that floats about 520 miles above Earth in roughly a north-south orbit, NOAA said.
Saddam has set oil fires before
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has ordered oil wells to be set ablaze in the past. After his forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and coalition forces were massing together to force them out, Saddam said if he had to be evicted from Kuwait by force, then Kuwait would be burned.
As promised, Iraqi troops set fire to more than 700 oil wells in several Kuwaiti oil fields in 1991 as they were retreating. Officials from the Kuwait Oil Company reported that all of Kuwait's oil fields had been damaged or destroyed by the Iraqis.
The United States helped Kuwait in an international nine-month effort to extinguish the blazes.
Before the fires, Iraq was responsible for intentionally releasing some 11 million barrels of oil into the Arabian Gulf from January to May 1991, oiling more than 800 miles of Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian coastline. The amount of oil released was categorized as 20 times larger than the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska and twice as large as the previous world record oil spill. The cost of cleanup was estimated at more than $700 million.

(CNN) -- U.S. Army Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former professional football player killed last month in Afghanistan, was probably killed by gunfire from his own unit during an intense firefight, the U.S. Army said Saturday."While there was no one specific finding of fault, the investigation indicated that Cpl. Tillman probably died of friendly fire while his unit was in combat with enemy forces," Lt. Gen. Philip Kensinger Jr., of the Army's Special Operations Command ,said at a news conference at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina."The results of this investigation in no way diminish the bravery and sacrifice of Cpl. Tillman," Kensinger said. "Cpl. Tillman was shot and killed while responding to enemy fire without regard to his personal safety."Tillman, who walked away from a $3.6 million contract with the Arizona Cardinals two years ago to serve in the military, was posthumously awarded a Silver Star on April 30."There is an inherent danger of confusion in any firefight particularly when a unit is ambushed, especially under difficult light and terrain environment," Kensinger said.Tillman, 27, was shot and killed April 22 during a ground convoy assault not far from Khowst, Afghanistan, near the eastern border with Pakistan. Two other coalition soldiers were wounded in the ambush and an Afghan militia force soldier was killed.The firefight in which Tillman died began about 7:30 p.m. when 10 to 20 ambushers attacked the convoy with mortars and small arms. Tillman's team had already passed the point of attack, but turned back to help, diving into an intensive battle that lasted about 20 minutes.A statement announcing the Silver Star said that Tillman directed his team to return fire against the fighters, who had attacked from higher ground.It said that because of Tillman's leadership and his team's efforts, the trail section of the convoy "was able to maneuver through the ambush to positions of safety without a single casualty." Tillman was a member of A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment based at Fort Lewis, Washington.His brother, Kevin, trained with him and served in the same unit.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

New York homicide rate on pace for record lowStory Highlights Murders in New York City were below 600 for five straight years, Bloomberg says NYPD: Since 2001, overall major felony crime decreased 26 percent citywide Mayor: Domestic violence-related murders dropped a record 36 percent this year NYPD: Success due to putting significant numbers of officers in troubled precincts Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO From Karina Frayter CNN	NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York City is on course to mark the fewest homicides since records have been kept, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced Wednesday. The city is expected to fall below 500 murders in 2007, the lowest level for any year since 1963, when comparable information on homicides was first collected, Bloomberg said at a news conference. "At the end of 2002, for the first time in four decades, murders in New York City fell below 600, and we were able to hold them below 600 for the next four years," Bloomberg said. "Today, with just five days of the year remaining, it appears that we have another historic achievement within our reach." Bloomberg said decreases in major felony crimes were recorded across every crime category and in all five boroughs in 2007, marking the seventeenth straight year in which crime has gone down. Since 2001, overall major felony crime has decreased 26 percent citywide, according to New York Police Department statistics. Watch how the city achieved success » Declines in domestic violence-related homicides and transit crime particularly stand out, Bloomberg told reporters. Domestic violence-related murders dropped a record 36 percent this year, the mayor said. The decline coincides with an effort by NYPD that doubled visits of specially trained detectives to households where domestic violence had occurred, officials noted. Crime in the subway system in 2007 fell 13 percent below the record low numbers recorded last year, despite subway ridership that's at an all-time high. Officials name "Operation Impact" as the prime reason for the decline in crime. The NYPD effort focuses on problem people and places, Kelly said. It places significant numbers of uniformed officers in small areas of precincts, where crime rates are relatively high. Given the success of Operation Impact, the NYPD will assign all of this year's Police Academy graduates to the program, Kelly said. Officials also credited an improved police and community partnership for the overall decline in crime. "We are not the same New York that we were in 1990, a year when more than 2,000 people were murdered," Bloomberg said. "We're also not the same city we were in 2001, when many predicted that our crime-fighting gains would soon be a point of diminishing returns."

(CNN) -- If left up to audiences, the trend of the undead will never die. Nominees for the 2010 People's Choice Awards were announced Tuesday, and the "Twilight" saga, "Vampire Diaries" and HBO's "True Blood" are all up for multiple awards, with the "Twilight" crew earning a mention in seven categories. The film based on Stephenie Meyer's goth teen romance series is up for favorite franchise, favorite movie and on-screen team, the latter featuring lead actors Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner. Each of the three was also recognized individually: Pattinson was nominated for people's choice movie actor, Stewart for movie actress and Lautner for breakout movie actor. Anna Kendrick, who plays one of the few humans in "Twilight," is up for best breakout actress. HBO's fan favorite "True Blood" earned nominations in the TV obsession and TV sci-fi/fantasy categories while star Anna Paquin was nominated for TV drama actress. "Vampire Diaries" earned a nod in both the TV sci-fi/fantasy category as well as in new TV drama. Smash horror flick "Paranormal Activity" also received a nomination and will go up against "Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail," "(500) Days of Summer" and the highly anticipated sci-fi film "District 9" in the independent movie category. On the music side, nominations are still rolling in for Eminem and Taylor Swift, who are both up for a number of American Music Awards. The Detroit rapper earned two People's Choice nominations for male artist and hip-hop artist, while Swift is nominated for People's Choice country artist, pop artist and female artist. The awards show, hosted by Queen Latifah, will air live January 6 on CBS.

Blagojevich retrial date could be set ThursdayBy the CNN Wire Staff Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was found guilty of one count of lying to the FBI. STORY HIGHLIGHTSJury found Blagojevich guilty of only one count of 24 against himBlagojevich faces racketeering and corruption-related charges (CNN) -- The date for round two in the Rod Blagojevich courtroom drama could be decided Thursday at a hearing. Lawyers are scheduled to get together at a Chicago, Illinois, federal courtroom where they could decide the date for the retrial of Blagojevich. Blagojevich was found guilty last week of lying to the FBI, but escaped convictions on 23 other counts in a trial seen as a partial victory for the former governor. The jury, which deliberated for 14 days, said it was hung on the counts against him and the counts against the former governor's brother, Robert Blagojevich. Video: Blagojevich convicted on one count

5 militants wanted in fatal airport attack killed in Pakistan police raid
By Nasir Habib, CNN
updated 9:56 AM EST, Mon December 17, 2012
Map: Peshawar, Pakistan
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two suspects blow themselves up
Three others die in a gunfire exchange with police
The attack on the airport takes place Saturday
The Taliban says its target was an air force base
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Five militants suspected to be behind an airport attack in Peshawar were killed Sunday morning when police raided a house where they were hiding.
The militants had taken the owner of the house hostage, said Peshawar Police Chief Imtiaz Altaf. When police raided the residence, two suspects blew themselves up and three others were killed in a gunfire exchange with officers.
Police had been looking for the men after three rockets were fired toward Peshawar's Bacha Khan International Airport on Saturday, killing at least nine people.
Syed Naveed Qamar, Pakistan's defense minister, said the target could have been an air force base, which is adjacent to the airport. Both the airport and the air base have the same entrance.
Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said after the attackers fired the rockets they tried but failed to drive an explosives-laden vehicle into the airport. The vehicle struck the airport's outer wall, blew up and killed five militants.
Other than the attackers, four civilians were also killed, Shahid said. He said 35 people were injured as well. Two of the rockets landed inside the airport and the other struck outside the facility.
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility of the attack. Taliban official Ehsanullah Ehsan said their target was in fact the air base.
"We have planned more attacks on Pakistani forces and its installation as it works to please the USA," Ehsan said.
Peshawar is near Pakistan's volatile tribal region. Militants have a strong presence in that region, which borders Afghanistan.

To Disney or not to Disney?
By Katia Hetter, CNN
updated 1:28 PM EDT, Fri March 22, 2013
Manchester University sociologist Robert Pettit and his class visit Disney World as part of his three-week course "Disney and American culture."
Deb Koma first took her son Alex to Disney World in 1994, when he was just two. That's him wearing the pirate hat. Some travelers are not so eager for all Disney has to offer.
Edward and Harriet Yu and their two daughters love the "top notch entertainment" and the character encounters they had on their latest Disney cruise. Guests can expect to meet Disney princesses such as Snow White, Cinderella and Belle at the Disney theme parks, resorts and certain restaurants. Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is one of its upscale properties. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Disney represents magical stories and fun family to fans
Some parents delight in their children's wonder during a first visit to Disney
Some critics think the company encourages kids to buy too much stuff Others worry the princess culture limits girls' potential
Editor's note: This is the first CNN.com Escape Debate, a monthly series that examines the cultural splits within travel, and why travelers divide along certain lines.
(CNN) -- To Disney or not to Disney?
For many travelers, especially those with children, it's not even a question they ask. They already know the answer.
"Yes."
To these visitors, Disney is Mickey Mouse, princesses, magic and fun. It's happy memories of childhood brought back to life in your children, a clean place where the rides are safe and the Disney characters are always happy to pose for pictures with your kids.
That's Deb Koma, who visited once as a child and walked back into the Magic Kingdom in the mid-1990s with her young son. "It was so perfect, everybody was so happy, everything was so maintained," said Koma, who now works for the AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. "You were in a perfect fantasy world. That, and my little boy loved it."
Disney's quick emergency response team
But for other vacationers, Disney inspires a firm "no."
To those travelers, Disney is merely a commercial machine built to sell tickets, overpriced toys and a stereotype of girls as princesses. They may remember visiting Disneyland or Disney World when they were children, but they aren't taking their kids there.
Downtown Disney to make way for Disney Springs
That's the Rev. J.C. Mitchell, who will be heading to Orlando, Florida, this year for a work conference but will not be taking his family with him, even though his job will cover most of the costs of his trip. "We do not enjoy Disney," wrote Mitchell, who went to Disney World as a child, via e-mail. "We believe it symbolically represents the excesses of our extremely individualistic society."
What is it about Disney that creates such a strong response from its dedicated fans and foes?
Whether you love or hate or merely tolerate the expansion of what Walt Disney started in 1923, there's no doubting that Disney is popular and its influence is everywhere.
All of those theme parks, resorts, cruises, movies, television shows, toys and other Disney businesses earned the company $11.3 billion in the last three months of 2012. More than $3 billion of that money came from Disney cruises and its 11 theme parks and 43 resorts across North America, Europe and Asia. One more park is under construction in Shanghai.
People like Disney. It ranked as the third most well-regarded company--behind only Amazon.com and Apple--in a recent Harris Interactive survey of people's opinions of the most visible companies' reputations.
Fortune ranks Disney as the most admired entertainment company and the ninth most admired overall, behind Apple (1), Google (2) and Amazon.com (3).
Still, there is this cultural split. Disney just rubs some people the wrong way. Whatever people think about Disney, it's probably what they're also thinking about American society and its values, said Manchester University sociologist Robert Pettit.
"Disney does such a wonderful job of representing American culture, they're almost synonymous with America," said Pettit, who teaches a three-week course, "Disney and American Culture," that includes a Disney World site visit. "They are master storytellers, and they have the narrative business down pat."
And behind the magic, "Disney is a capitalistic corporation bent on consumerism, and that's what drives our economy," he said. "It brings out people's opinions about our society and culture in general. You can love them or be very critical of those aspects of our culture and society because it portrays them so well."
Why Disney might want to 'Escape From Tomorrow'
The magic of their children's reactions
Disney is magic for Edward and Harriett Yu of Los Altos, California. The Yu family and their two daughters have happily visited Disney theme parks about every two years, and the family has sailed on two Disney cruises. Edward Yu even booked a family reunion on one of the cruises last year, reserving 10 cabins for his extended family two years in advance.
"For us as parents, it's a chance to connect back to our own childhood and brings back happy memories," wrote Yu in an e-mail. "Now that we have kids, it's priceless to see their reactions as they experience the parks/rides/shows for their first time. Words can't describe the preciousness of seeing our little ones thoroughly enjoying themselves on Disney attractions."
Because it's Disney, "we know we can expect top-notch entertainment each time we go," wrote Yu, 46. "And there is an expectation that guests behave properly, which I appreciate."
Yu isn't a Disney apologist: He says that Disney's princess influence can be a bit much.
He also wishes there were more healthy food options at the parks. "You figure a park of Disney's caliber could make the food experience better." But he thinks it's worth the occasional visit just to see the expressions on his girls' faces.
Beyond Mickey Mouse: Disney tops cruise ship rankings
The Disney purist
It just made sense to Punam Patel that she would get married at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, this week.
Patel, 26, grew up 15 minutes away from the theme park and visited several times per week with her father and two siblings. Her dad would drink from his Mickey Mouse coffee cup with its free refills while the kids went on rides, and he'd bring it home to wash for another day of free coffee.
One cafe cook still working there remembers cooking breakfast for her on the weekends, Patel said.
When Patel and her future husband decided on a two-month engagement and a small wedding reception, she quickly booked the park's $5,000 wedding garden package for just 20 people (including the bride and groom). Her father-in-law has given the couple a Disney cruise for their honeymoon to schedule whenever they'd like.
But Patel won't visit Walt Disney World.
"I grew up going to Disneyland, and that's the original park," she said. "I'm a Disney conservationist. Walt Disney World looks so big, and it's not him (Walt Disney). I think you lose the intimate magic that happens at Disneyland. It's way more corporate. Disneyland feels like being at home."
Excesses of commercialism
For Lindsay Potts and her family, a good vacation is spending time with their extended family, outdoors and in nature. Potts hasn't ever visited any Disney parks but she says that paying lots of money to stand in line for "fast-paced, high-pressure" entertainment isn't for her. (Her husband visited Disneyland and Disney World as a child.)
She also doesn't want to support Disney.
"Spending hundreds of dollars to wait in lines and be surrounded by consumerism does not appeal to us," wrote Potts, who lives in Brownstown, Indiana. "Disney is a brand and also portrays a certain lifestyle that aligns with current corporate American culture.
"We have chosen to live a more alternative life style that is rooted in sustainability, equality and entertainment that is independent of television and popular media."
The princess stereotype
Alissa Guntren of Bloomington, Indiana, went to Disney World in Florida as a child, but she won't be taking her daughters to Disney theme parks either. No matter how far Disney's princess stories have come, she doesn't want her daughters limiting themselves.
"While I am not averse to my daughters exploring fantasy worlds, I find that Disney and Disney products present children, especially girls, with a very limited fantasy world -- one in which a prince will sweep them off their feet so that they can then live happily ever after," wrote Guntren in an e-mail. "I want my daughters to be confident as individuals, not to grow up thinking there is a prince out there waiting to save them."
"In addition, I have a difficult time with the princess body types that Disney presents children with, which is an idealized adult female body type and not an appropriate one for my young and impressionable children to try to emulate."
Consumer behavior expert Kit Yarrow isn't surprised that people have such strong emotional reactions to Disney, positive or negative.
"People have strong feelings about it because Disney is such a prominent part of their childhoods," said Yarrow, chair of Golden Gate University's psychology department in San Francisco. "Whether you went to theme parks or watched movies and cartoons or got the goodies in some way shape or form, it's touched nearly everybody's lives."
The feelings Disney is able to evoke are incredible, she said. People who love Disney feel the perfection and happiness of the culture.
"And that's exactly what repulses other people; a 'plasticness' that other people find offensive. In a world that is increasingly crass and negative, it's a positive, predictable happy place. "
Everything in moderation Brooklyn minister Ann Kansfield, 37, has a word of caution for parents keeping their children completely away from Disney -- or anything else. Her parents didn't take her to Disney theme parks because it would have been expensive to fly the family of four from Rochester, New York, to California or Florida. They were saving for other things.
Kansfield doesn't remember wanting any Disney toys. "I really just wanted to ride the rides," she wrote. "I definitely realized by high school that I wasn't going there any time soon."
After a couple months of dedicated Superstorm Sandy relief work, Kansfield and her family were on a cruise with the chance to take a day trip to Disney World.
"I'm really thankful that my parents hadn't taken me to Disney before, because it made this trip extra special," she wrote. "Plus, I did feel like a little bit of a Disney rebel -- finally getting to go.
"Parents can do everything in our power to limit our children's access to the Disney Industrial Complex, but even when we limit it, they'll find other ways to watch the shows, sing the songs and be involved with Disney-something-or-another. We choose to enjoy it together as a family in small doses, which seems reasonable."

Pedrosa claims pole at Montmelo in record time updated 1:21 PM EDT, Sat June 15, 2013
Championship leader Dani Pedrosa recorded the fastest lap ever at Montmelo in Spain. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dani Pedrosa takes pole at Catalunya Grand Prix with fastest ever time at Montmelo
Pedrosa beat Cal Crutchlow and Jorge Lorenzo by more than half a second in qualifying
Seven-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi continues to struggle, finishing seventh
(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa appears set to extend his lead in the MotoGP series standings after clocking the fastest ever time at Montmelo in qualifying for the Catalunya Grand Prix.
Pedrosa delighted his home fans by registering a time of one minute 40.893 seconds to claim pole position on a sweltering day near Barcelona.
He was more than half-a-second quicker in his Honda than Yamaha teammates Cal Crutchlow and Jorge Lorenzo.
"It's difficult to do what I did especially when it is so hot," Pedrosa said.
He added later: "I have broken the record and I am very happy, although the objective was just to be on the front row. I had great feelings and I have gone out with a great lap."
Lorenzo, the reigning world champion and Pedrosa's fellow Spaniard, made up ground in the standings when he triumphed at Mugello in Italy earlier this month. Pedrosa's advantage shrunk to 12 points through five races.
Read: Lorenzo claims Mugello treble
Despite being overtaken by Lorenzo at the first corner and not able to reclaim the lead, Pedrosa said he was happy with second place in what had been a "difficult weekend."
Lorenzo: Motorcycling is like dancing
A country club for exotic sports cars
F1's spiritual home in the U.S.
His sizzling time Saturday came midway in qualifying, while Lorenzo recorded his fastest time at the end of qualifying like Crutchlow.
He earlier had to switch bikes because of a clutch problem.
"We are on the first row, which is the most important thing for tomorrow," Lorenzo said. "We have to keep improving, but it will be a completely different race tomorrow.
"It will be very hot and we will run slower than our best lap today."
Rookie Marc Marquez, another Spaniard, endured more disappointment when he finished sixth in his Honda.
Read: Marquez makes history
He slipped to third in the standings after a crash-filled weekend at Mugello.
Valentino Rossi headed into Saturday in good spirits after leading the way in Friday's practice. But the seven-time world champion struggled in qualifying in his Yamaha, ending up more than a second behind Pedrosa in seventh.

"I want to have a diner," she says, sitting on her bed in her parents' house in Oxford, Connecticut.
"I'd like to make things that people think are yummy healthier, less fatty, and make it like they're being cooked for the Queen."
Chelsea loves helping her parents, Chris and Linda, prepare food for the whole family. They say she spends much of her free time watching the Food Network looking out for new recipes.
But Chelsea cannot taste the food she makes. She can eat almost no food at all. She suffers from a rare disease that has caused her intestine to fail irreversibly.
"I have an unusual body compared to other people," she says almost dismissively, but that's more than an understatement.
Chelsea has to wear a special backpack for 16 hours every day that feeds her nutrients intravenously.
"My stomach doesn't work and that's why I have a line," she says, "because, well, I can't eat real food so I've got to have IV fluids, and so the line goes into my artery so I don't have to have food to my stomach."
Chelsea's "giving tree" at the Oxford, Connecticut, Town Hall allows her donors to hang paper doves with their names.
Chelsea has been sick all her life. She suffers from mitochondrial disease, an energy production problem meaning mitochondria in cells don't function properly. She also has tachycardia, or a too-rapid heartbeat.
In addition, in 2011 she was diagnosed with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a rare condition in which the intestine loses the ability to contract and push food through the gastrointestinal tract. This problem led to the intestinal failure.
Her life story is one of pain, suffering and fighting. She's has had to endure numerous stays at hospitals, more than 30 surgeries and even went into life-threatening septic shock once.
"Last year was our worst, where she went into septic shock on Halloween and woke up in the morning, couldn't use half her body," Linda Wheeler recalls.
Chelsea's situation has deeply affected her family, which includes four other children.
"When you really step back and think about all the activities you go to, it normally revolves around some kind of food. You know, whether its sports, family or birthdays," says her dad, Chris Wheeler.
Even though Chelsea can't eat, she does her best to lead a fairly normal life. She refuses to wear her backpack with the nutrients at school, and she sets the table for the family ahead of dinners, even though she's not able to taste the meals she helps prepare.
"The kids come home from school, and she's in the kitchen preparing them snacks," Linda Wheeler says. "It must be her way of coping."
But Chelsea cannot cope with intravenous feeding much longer. She's in need of what's called a small bowel transplant, where the part of her intestine that has failed will be replaced. It's a fairly rare procedure, but Chelsea's doctor, Donna Zeiter, says the risks are decreasing:
"As our ability to manage rejection develops, as our ability to manage infection and infectious complications has improved, survivability has actually become quite acceptable."
It's not clear when the operation could take place. Currently, 262 patients in the United States are awaiting an intestine transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. The intestine cannot be taken from a living donor.
"Unfortunately, you're waiting for a child to die," Linda Wheeler says. "... They had told us anywhere from six months to three years. So I think there's no way to know."
It is clear, however, that the procedure will be expensive, and the Wheelers will have to pay some of the bills out of their own pocket.
Their community of Oxford is helping out. A giving tree has been set up at the Oxford Town Hall, where people who donate can hang paper doves with their names.
"She's one of us, and we're very proud of her," says Oxford First Selectman George R. Temple. "We're proud of her courage. She's very happy and upbeat and optimistic and just the kind of kid that you can't help pull for."
The Children's Organ Transplant Association has also taken on Chelsea's case and started a website and Facebook page, where donations to help pay for costs arising from transplant operations can be made. The Wheelers say if a donor is found, Chelsea will have to remain in the hospital for close to a year, including for the procedure as well as the immediate aftercare.
Chelsea doesn't seem to doubt she will make it.
"I'm all messed up, but you know, I just have to wait for my transplant, and then most medical things will go away," she says in a defiant, confident tone.
She continues to plan for her diner: It will be called Chelly's because that's her nickname, and she has already found a building in her hometown where she would like to set the restaurant up.
This girl who has fought all her life to stay alive says she wants nothing more than to offer people a great culinary experience -- even though she can't enjoy it herself right now.
"You don't need to be a millionaire to eat there every night," she says as her eyes light up, "but you will feel like a millionaire when you eat there."
