Review: Something is rotten in 'Hamlet 2'Story Highlights CNN.com's Tom Charity: "Hamlet 2" doesn't measure up to star Steve Coogan Film wants to be outrageously funny but misses much of the "funny" However, big musical number "Rock Me Sexy Jesus" does do the job Next Article in Entertainment » By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- "Hamlet 2." Are you laughing yet? Steve Coogan, in white shirt, gives his all in the big musical scene from "Hamlet 2." You should be, because the jokes don't get any better than the title. A little movie that's getting a big push from Focus (which paid a princely $10 million to pick it up at Sundance), "Hamlet 2" is not the sequel to the 1990 Mel Gibson (in)action flick we've all been waiting for but a spotty comedy about a failed actor and failing high school drama teacher who fancies himself a playwright. Needless to say, he is alone in this opinion. I don't know whether "South Park" scribe Pam Brady or "Dick" director Andrew Fleming (who shares a screenplay credit with her) conceived this scenario as a vehicle for brilliant British comic actor Steve Coogan, but that's the way it's worked out. Indeed, sometimes "Hamlet 2" feels like an overpopulated one-man show. But the material doesn't measure up to Coogan's capabilities. Dana Marschz is a recognizable Coogan type: sexually ambiguous, deluded, a dolt with artistic ambitions far, far in advance of his talent. (Coogan's played similar figures before, notably in his TV series starring the excruciatingly narcissistic borderline celebrity Alan Partridge.) Snippets from his staging of "Erin Brockovich" leave no room for doubt on that score. Even the 10th-grade critic on the school paper is scathing. Coogan is generally a bit of a cold fish, but at least Marschz has sincerity on his side. He's still nursing daddy issues and is genuinely shocked when his wife (an underused but characteristically tart Catherine Keener) leaves him, even if we're not. Like Alan Partridge, he's also a suck-up to celebrity. In one neat sequence, he goes ga-ga over actress Elisabeth Shue, who politely explains she's quit the business to become a nurse. He begs her to come and talk to his students, although she's convinced they won't know who she is. (They don't.) The movie shapes up as if it means to parody the inspirational teacher school of schmaltz: Marschz turns to "Dangerous Minds" and "Dead Poets Society" as he tries to instill a love of drama in a class of unimpressed Latinos. But Fleming seems to have gotten bored with this idea, which leaves some gaping plot holes. Instead, Marschz suddenly flips forward to envisage a show so incongruous it becomes a First Amendment test case for a civil rights lawyer (Amy Poehler). "Hamlet 2" is that show, in which the gloomy Dane ends up in a time machine, dropping in on George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, Albert Einstein and Jesus Christ. It doesn't make much sense that this travesty is staged with breathtaking razzamatazz (did Dana suddenly become a terrific director after all?), but there's no question that the 15-minute spectacular is the movie's highlight. The astonishing song-and-dance number "Rock Me Sexy Jesus" occupies prime position and makes a calculated bid for "Springtime for Hitler" status, though "Raped in the Face" is the real jaw-dropper. Some of the show's rude energy might have been welcome earlier on. (Indeed, maybe the whole film should have been done as a musical.) But for all Coogan's tireless efforts, "Hamlet 2" is palpably hit and miss. It simply doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. Focus must be hoping it will prove to be a commercial breakthrough for the actor, and coming off his cruelly abbreviated turn in "Tropic Thunder," the timing may be right. But, in general, "Hamlet 2" lets him down. "Hamlet 2" is rated R and runs 92 minutes.

Moderate Republicans back Kagan on hot-button issuesBy the CNN Wire Staff GOP Sen. Scott Brown meets with Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan in his office Thursday in Washington, D.C. STORY HIGHLIGHTSGOP Sens. Scott Brown and Susan Collins back Kagan on key issuesSupport increases Supreme Court nominee's chances of being confirmedKagan has completed second day of meetings with senators on Capitol Hill Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan received critical cover from moderate Republicans on Thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings: gays in the military and judicial experience. Kagan has been strongly criticized by GOP leaders for her efforts to block military recruiters from Harvard University during her time as the school's law school dean because of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The policy, opposed by President Obama, prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. Top Republicans have also highlighted the fact that Kagan has never served as a federal judge, something that distinguishes her from all nine current members of the high court. If party moderates break from the GOP leadership on these issues, it dramatically increases Kagan's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country's 112th Supreme Court justice.

Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats' 60-member filibuster-proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military. "It was the first question I actually asked her because, having been in the military, I had concerns about [her] position at Harvard," Brown said. "It was very clear to me, after we spoke about it at length, that she is supportive of the men and women who are fighting to protect us and very supportive of the military as a whole. I do not feel that her judicial philosophy will hurt the men and women who are serving." While dean at Harvard Law, Kagan said she "abhorred" the military's "discriminatory recruitment policy." She called it "a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order." Kagan supported other schools' challenges to a federal law requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law in 2006. Earlier in the day, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she doesn't have any concerns about Kagan's experience. She also said she didn't see any "extraordinary circumstances" that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against Kagan. Collins said that Kagan told her she considers Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion, to be settled law. Kagan herself has remained tight-lipped when asked such questions from reporters. The support of Brown and Collins alone, combined with a unified Democratic caucus, would be enough to ensure Kagan's confirmation. In addition to meeting with Brown and Collins on Thursday, Kagan stopped by the offices of five key Senate Democrats: Massachusetts' John Kerry, New York's Chuck Schumer, Maryland's Ben Cardin, Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter. Specter said Kagan may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of Supreme Court hearings. "She said it'd be helpful to the public and to the court," he said. "This was the best answer I've gotten" from any recent Supreme Court candidate. Specter is a staunch advocate of allowing television cameras into the high court. Most justices, however, have adamantly opposed the idea. Specter also said Kagan stood by comments she made in 1995, when she dismissed the confirmation hearing process as a "charade." Kagan's meeting with Specter attracted considerable attention because of his political troubles. Specter -- who is facing a tough primary fight next week -- voted against Kagan for solicitor general before switching from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. Specter has not said how he will vote on her Supreme Court nomination. Some political observers have speculated that his previous opposition to Kagan, combined with an unwillingness to immediately back her now, could undercut his support with stalwart Democrats. A quick declaration in favor of Kagan, on the other hand, could strike some voters as political opportunism. Kagan kicked off her Capitol Hill meetings on Wednesday, visiting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. She also met with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's top Republican. Obama nominated Kagan on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. If confirmed, she would become the third woman on the current nine-member bench and the fourth woman in the court's history.CNN's Ted Barrett and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.

8 goofy gadgets from CES
By Brandon Griggs, CNN
updated 12:48 PM EST, Thu January 12, 2012 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
The world's largest consumer electronics show isn't just about splashy TVs, phones and tablets. CES's massive show floor also is home to plenty of less-hyped but quirkier gadgets. Here are eight that got our attention.
This rechargeable robotic toy, about the size of a softball, acts as if it has a mind of its own. But really it's controlled via Bluetooth by your Apple or Android device. You can make the ball roll around the house, change colors, play games and spook the family pet. Available: this month. Price: $129. This playful little magnetic gadget is supposed to live on your fridge. It lets you record brief video messages for your live-in companions -- "If you go to the store, can you pick up some milk?" -- and play back their memos to you. Texting works the same way, of course, but it's not as cute. Available: now. Price: $59.
If you own an iPad and are nostalgic for those arcade video games of your misspent youth, this gadget is for you. Slip the iPad or iPad 2 into the dock, download an Atari app and wiggle the joystick to play Asteroids, Centipede and all those retro classics. Available: now. Price: $59.
This collar is part of a GPS tracking system that pinpoints a dog's whereabouts on a map. Owners also can create a "virtual fence" called the Tagg zone in their neighborhoods; if your dog wanders outside the zone, you'll receive a text and/or e-mail alert. Available: now. Price: $99, plus a $7.95 monthly fee. Billed as the world's first connected scale for babies and toddlers, this gadget makes it easier for new parents to chart their baby's weight over time. Parents can access their child's weight readings from any connected device, post them to Facebook and share them easily with family members or their doctor. Available: spring. Price: About $179. Your trusty Swiss Army knife can open beer bottles and trim your nails. Now it can store your digital data, too. Maker Victorinox says it's the smallest high-capacity flash drive on the market, capable of downloading 14 hours of music in 60 seconds. It encrypts your data too for security's sake. Available: spring. Price: $470 (for 64GB) up to about $2,000 (for 1TB).
Now you can sing along badly to tunes in the shower. This water-resistant, Bluetooth-enabled speaker plays music wirelessly from all Apple and Android devices. With a 200-foot range, it's also detachable for use in the backyard or by the pool. Available: now. Price: $99.
This isn't a gadget, exactly, but a very cool feature on LG Electronics' newest high-end refrigerator. Most cans of soda or beer take about 40 minutes to chill in the fridge, but the Blast Chiller compartment, using accelerated, swirling-air technology, somehow does it in five. Of course, you could always just put the can in the freezer. Price and availability not announced.

John McAfee says he faked heart attack to avoid deportation to Belize
By John Zarrella, CNN
updated 8:54 PM EST, Thu December 13, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Belize authorities want to talk to McAfee, a spokesman says He's been on the run since his Belize neighbor was found dead November 11 McAfee has said Belize authorities are corrupt and have been trying to get him
After being on the run and in immigration detention, he arrived in Miami on Wednesday
(CNN) -- American technology pioneer John McAfee said he faked a heart attack while detained in Guatemala to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, hastening the government's decision to send him back to the United States.
After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday.
He said Belize authorities in April 2011 accused him of running a methamphetamine lab, before the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull, and have since persecuted him.
McAfee fights to stay out of Belize "I have absolutely nothing to do with the murder in Belize," he said Thursday. "This is not about a murder in Belize. This began on the 30th of April of last year when 42 armed soldiers stormed my property."
Mystery follows McAfee to Miami
After weeks in hiding, the 67-year-old antivirus software company founder emerged in Guatemala's capital last week to ask for asylum.
Guatemalan authorities took him into custody on accusations of entering the country illegally, and his asylum bid was rejected. McAfee then waged a public battle, requesting asylum and arguing that police in Belize were after him following his apparent decision to shed light on corruption in the country.
He also said the breach resulted in Belize soldiers shooting his dog. CNN cannot independently verify his account.
"He opted to return to his country of origin," said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week.
On Sunday, McAfee told reporters that he hoped to go back to the United States.
"Our intent is to return to America, if at all possible, and settle down to whatever normal life we can settle down to under the circumstances," he said. "There is no hope for my life if I am ever returned to Belize."
Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to him about Faull's death.
McAfee's home on Ambergris Caye, an island off Belize's mainland, was raided after Faull's death. National police spokesman Raphael Martinez said authorities went into the house amid suspicions there were illicit weapons and drugs inside, but neither were found.

Stallworth, who suffered severe burns, was in the balloon with a female friend, his lawyer says The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating (CNN) -- Two people, including pro football player Donte Stallworth, were hospitalized Saturday after the hot air balloon they were riding in crashed into power lines in Miami, police said.
A third passenger in the balloon was not injured.
Police responded to calls at around 10 a.m. about the basket of the hot air balloon crashing into the power lines while airborne.
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash with the help of Miami-Dade police, Detective Roy Rutland said. Video from CNN affiliate WSVN showed the basket (where people stand) upright on a two-lane road, while the envelope (the balloon part) sat some distance nearby.
Stallworth suffered severe burns and is in stable condition at Miami's Kendall Regional Medical Center, said his attorney, Christopher Lyons.
The wide receiver was in the balloon with a female friend when the accident occurred, according to Lyons. The lawyer did not name the woman or detail her condition. The third person was operating the balloon, according to local media reports.
The California native began his NFL career in 2002 with the New Orleans Saints and most recently played for the New England Patriots. His is currently a free agent.
Drew Rosenhaus, Stallworth's sports agent, said his client is "in good spirits."
"He was injured, but will be fine," said Rosenhaus, adding later that he hopes Stallworth is back playing "in a matter of weeks." "He will be able to resume his NFL career."
Beyond his on-field exploits -- from his time at the University of Tennessee to his years playing with the Saints, Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens and Washington Redskins -- Stallworth is known for hitting and killing a construction worker crossing a street in Miami in 2009.
Under a plea agreement, Stallworth was sentenced to 30 days in jail for DUI manslaughter. He also reached an "amicable" settlement with the Reyes family, his lawyer, Lyons, said. The NFL also suspended him for one season.
CNN's Rick Martin and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

'Millennials:' the new face of business travel
By Daisy Carrington, for CNN
updated 6:20 AM EST, Tue November 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
By 2020, 'millennials' -- people aged between 18 and 30 -- will be half of business travelers
Currently, they account for half of hotel bookings
Their travel habits are changing the face of hospitality
(CNN) -- The long-held stereotype of the business traveler -- predominantly male, predominantly white, suited up with a briefcase in hand -- is swiftly changing. According to some, the shifting landscape is all down to the 'millennials.' Young, diverse, tech-savvy, and umbilically connected to their smart phones, the post-80s generation is expected to account for half of all business flights by 2020. It's no wonder airlines and hotels are racing to meet their needs.
Generation last-minute
"The two things they want different to other generations, is they want spontaneity, and they want to be connected," notes Lee McCabe, the global head of travel at Facebook.
"This is the generation that is more likely to change travel plans at the last minute, they're more likely to book at the last minute, and they want to be connected 24/7."
As the travel industry has traditionally hinged on advanced reservations, this new attitude is shaking things up considerably. McCabe points out that increasingly, airlines and hotels are rolling out last-minute booking options to target this growing market.
Hotels of the future
As millennials make up 50% of hotel bookings, it's no wonder the hospitality industry was one of the first to tap into their mind set. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide has been decidedly ahead of the curve, launching Aloft -- a brand squarely aimed at the group -- back in 2008.

"This generation is collaborative. They are part of a social community, and they like sharing things [with that community], whether it's about a cocktail they're out having, or maybe what they're having for dinner or what they're doing this weekend," says Brian McGuinness, global brand leader of Aloft Hotels.
Though the desires of a younger generation of business traveller may sound obvious, knowing how to translate their social proclivities isn't always straight forward. To do this, Aloft has created hotels with lots of open, public spaces, and put their guest at the center of the hotel experience. Even the check-in desk is in the middle of the lobby, rather than placed at the back, as was once traditional.
"[Our guests] are self-expressers. They want to be front-and-center, and part of the guest experience, so we made the traditional desk sort of like a DJ booth," says McGuinness, who refers to guests as "talent".

Fussy millennials redefine travel
"Our talent are controlling the light and music in the lobby. Quite frankly, they're controlling the overall vibe in this public space."
Tinder to the rescue
Traditionally, life for road warriors has been a particularly lonely existence. For the new breed of traveler, meeting people is easier than clicking a button (or swiping a screen). Tinder, a GPS dating app that is growing by 15% every week, according to CEO Sean Rad, is increasingly attracting users who aren't necessarily in the market for a hook-up.

"I use it whenever I go to other cities. Generally, as soon as I have wi-fi, I get on Tinder to see who's in the area," says Jenny Levy, a subscriber who travels regularly for work.
"When I was in Los Angeles, I met up with someone and we went for a drink. It wasn't successful, but now I know someone that lives in LA," she explains.
"Tinder makes your experience of traveling less intimidating, because the second you land, you can start making new social relationships in that area," Rad says. "Traditionally for business travelers, if they want to meet people they might go down to the hotel bar. These young people are doing it very differently."
