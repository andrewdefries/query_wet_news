Next Tiger? Might be the man from Northern Ireland By Steve Almasy, CNN After winning the U.S. Open on Father's Day, 22-year-old Rory McIlroy celebrates with his dad. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Rory McIlroy, 22, hails from Northern Ireland, where he rose through the junior golf ranks McIlroy bounced back from disappointment at the Masters to win the next major tournament Some predict greatness for him, and he tells Piers Morgan he can be the best ever McIlroy's family made sacrifices, with dad bartending among his several jobs (CNN) -- On a hot April afternoon, young Rory McIlroy had the lead and only nine holes to play before he could become the Masters golf champion. Just 24 hours later, the Northern Irishman would tweet a picture of himself and Charl Schwartzel on a jet, both smiling, and one of them wearing the famed green jacket awarded to the winner of the most revered golf title in the world. It wasn't McIlroy. For on that April Sunday, he had fallen apart, blown his lead big-time, shooting a horrendous 8-over-par 80. Schwartzel leaped over him and other contenders to win one of the most exciting Masters ever with birdies on the final four holes. McIlroy's tumble started on the 10th hole, when he hit a tee shot like a public course duffer into the woods and ended up losing three strokes to par. But after his very visible loss, the then-21-year-old didn't hide from defeat or from the press. McIlroy's tee shot on the 10th hole at the Masters ended up near one of the cabins on the course. "I didn't handle [the adversity on the course] particularly well, obviously, but it was a character-building day, put it that way," he said that night. "I'll come out stronger for it." Some of the media, impressed by his grace, trotted out the well-worn cliche: He has the talent, but time will tell if he has the stuff champions are made of. It didn't take long for McIlroy to prove he does. Two months later, in the next major golf tournament, he thoroughly dominated the U.S. Open field all four days, winning by an unheard-of eight shots. "He's certainly captured everyone's imagination," said Gary Van Sickle, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated and Golf.com. But Van Sickle warned it might be a little early to call McIlroy the next Tiger Woods, who won the Masters at age 21 after winning three U.S. amateur championships. "I would hold off on handing him the crown just yet," he said of the No. 3-ranked player in the world. "But he's got a great swing, and he is impressive." Comparisons are inevitable. Both started as very, very young players. Both appeared on a TV show as a prodigy -- Woods on Mike Douglas at age 3; McIlroy appearing on a Northern Ireland show at age 9. Both were beating older golfers while in their teens and winning many junior tournaments. McIlroy talks about dealing with disaster
McIlroy told CNN's Piers Morgan that he sees only a few connections between himself and Woods. "You know, at 22, we both had one major. He won a couple more times than I have in my career," McIlroy said. "But I mean I have to let other people make comparisons, because if I go -- am trying, you know, to chase his records -- I'll lose sight of what I need to do to actually -- to win tournaments." And while trying to remain somewhat modest, he agreed with the assessment that he'll be mentioned in future discussions as the greatest ever. "Yeah, I do. I do. But I don't really know if people want to hear that. I mean, I believe that myself. Yes," he told Morgan. "I'm very confident in my own abilities. I believe in myself. ... "I said something a couple of days ago. I said, I'm not playing for money, I'm playing for a place in history." Both Woods and Jack Nicklaus have predicted a very high place in history for McIlroy. After the Open win, Nicklaus, who's counseled McIlroy for several years, said, "He's humble when he ought to be and confident when he needs to be." The mop-haired, freckled kid is very likeable, too, Van Sickle said, and not just because of his adorable looks. He's good people, too. It's isn't something put on for the fans now that he is rich and famous, the writer said. And it's not a recent development. McIlroy was the lowest-scoring amateur at the 2007 British Open. Van Sickle recalled asking the young man for an interview as he readied for the 2007 British Open, one of his first times in the media spotlight. Despite being pursued by the press, the then-18-year-old was like sure thing, whatever you need, no question is off limits. And he's still that same normal guy today, Van Sickle said. The kind of fella who gets on a plane just after choking away the lead at the Masters and tells his buddy, the guy who won, to put on the green jacket because he wants to take a picture. That he tweets with the message: Flying to Malaysia with charl! Glad one of us has a green jacket on!!! Or the kind of lad who goes to Haiti the week before the U.S. Open, finding a little life perspective to help his golf game. McIlroy's success is no fluke, said Shane O'Donoghue, host of CNN's "Living Golf." His talent was obvious from the day McIlroy first picked up a club. Which was when he was 2. And he hit the ball 40 yards. It was his desire to be a great golfer that prompted his devoted parents, Gerry and Rosie, to get behind their prodigious child. They worked night shifts and two and three extra jobs to fund his ambitions. His dad often bartended at the Holywood Golf Club in County Down, where Rory would practice. To this day, McIlroy never takes this support for granted, O'Donoghue said. McIlroy has always been keen to point out that he was never pushed by his parents, that it was indeed him doing all the pushing, all the dreaming and, crucially, all the practice. McIlroy on Irish golfing success
His father is a good golfer, too, and with uncles who are also low handicappers, there has always been a competitive arena among the McIlroy clan since the earliest days at Holywood. That's where Rory's sporting passion was fostered. These days, McIlroy still often has family and friends nearby when he competes. They won't have too far to travel when the British Open, the third major of the year, tees off Thursday in Kent, England, with McIlroy likely to be the betting and fan favorite. "He's going to have the crowd behind him like they were for Tiger when he was winning everything," Van Sickle said. "It'll be a 'home game' for him. He's used to playing in that kind of weather, and he's going to have a big comfort zone. He'll be the favorite in the British Open for the next 10 years." The Royal St. George's course is "quirky," Van Sickle said. It's where a brisk wind can take a shot that starts in the center of the fairway and push it into rough terrain or worse -- deep bunkers. I'm not playing for money, I'm playing for a place in history--Rory McIlroy

If McIlroy wins again, no doubt his popularity among fans in Europe and the United States will take off exponentially. The question then becomes: Will he continue to play mostly on his home continent, or will he come to America, where the tournament paydays are much larger? While it would disappoint PGA Tour officials, McIlroy will probably continue to play overseas, Van Sickle guessed. He can still play in eight to 10 tournaments in the U.S. (three majors and another handful of top-level tournaments) and still be a player whom advertisers will seek out. He already reportedly makes millions each year in endorsements and appearance fees. But the injured Woods missed the U.S. Open and will also sit out the British. He also missed a good portion of 2010 because of his infidelity scandal. Golf's popularity has suffered with the absence of the player who was a strong favorite to win every tournament he played. As Charley Hoffman told Alan Shipnuck of Sports Illustrated: "But for casual fans, I think they need a dominant player to focus on. They need to know what the story line is." If you were a wagering person, Van Sickle said, the smart money would be on a 22-year-old kid from Northern Ireland with a poodle-like fro and a big smile. And a man who learned a very big lesson on a miserable day in April. Share this on:

Twitter newbie Rupert Murdoch following fake account
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 12:03 PM EST, Tue January 3, 2012 | Filed under: Social Media
Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has followed four users since joining Twitter this weekend -- and one's a fake.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
News Corporation's Rupert Murdoch starts Twitter life by following fake "Larry Page"
The account resembles Google's Larry Page but is in fact part of a college project
So far, the media mogul is following four accounts on Twitter
Two of the four accounts Murdoch follows are tech CEOs
(CNN) -- Looks like it could take awhile for new Twitter user Rupert Murdoch to get the hang of things.
For starters, the 80-year-old media mogul, who signed up for Twitter over the New Year's holiday, might want to make sure the people he follows are real.
As of Monday, the oft-controversial Murdoch was following a grand total of four people on the social networking site. One of them, at first glance, appears to be Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page.
Except that it's not Larry Page but a parody account that's part of a university project.
"This is a fake account - part of a series created for @plaidavenger's class at Virginia Tech," the owner of the account tweeted Monday in reply to a follower asking about it after seeing an interaction with Murdoch. It wasn't clear Monday whether the News Corporation CEO was aware of the misunderstanding.
The Twitter chat started with "Plaid Larry Page" welcoming the magnate to the site. "Welcome @rupertmurdoch to Twitter! Could Google+ be next?" he wrote Sunday.
Murdoch's reply: "Maybe soon, but I'm getting killed for fooling around here and friends frightened what I may really say!"
Indeed. Less than a day into his Twitter tenure, Murdoch had been publicly chastised by what appeared to be his wife (fellow Twitter newbie Wendi Deng) for a tweet saying that "maybe Brits have too many holidays for [a] broke country."
He quickly backed down, deleting the tweet in question.
[UPDATE: Both Twitter and the account owner have acknowledged that the Deng account is a fake not really run by her. Twitter had mistakenly given the account "verified" status shortly after it was created.]
Murdoch tweets support for Rick Santorum
It's hard to figure out what to make of Murdoch's other three follows, other than that he appears to be taking his new venture into Web and social-media culture seriously. Some have ventured it's part of a "charm offensive" after a year in which he was embroiled in a phone-hacking controversy at his now-defunct "News of the World" newspaper.
Alan Sugar, a British magnate and reality-TV judge, as well as Twitter nemesis of CNN's own Piers Morgan, is one of them.
The other two are Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Zynga CEO Mark Pincus -- the man behind such online time-killers as "FarmVille" and "Mafia Wars."

Who is arming the Syrian conflict?
By Nick Thompson, CNN
updated 8:36 PM EDT, Sun October 7, 2012
Syrian rebel fighters look at a multi-rocket launcher in Tal Abyadh, a Syrian town close to the Turkish border, on Thursday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NATO country Turkey has most powerful military in the region
Syria has long been the Middle East's top importer of Russian military equipment
Rebels are mostly surviving on black market guns and arms taken from Syria's military
Analyst says fall of heavily armed Syrian army would lead to worse situation than Libya
(CNN) -- Syria's shelling of a border town in Turkey has sparked fears that President Bashar al-Assad's attempt to snuff out a rebellion at home could turn into a damaging regional war between the two neighbors.
Five civilians, all women and children, in the town of Akcakale were killed by Syrian artillery rounds in the worst single case of violence on the Turkish side of the border since Syria's unrest began last year.
What's behind Syria's shelling of Turkey?
While Syria hasn't confirmed its motive for firing into Turkey, rebels fighting an 18-month war against the Assad regime have allegedly been using positions on the Turkish border as a safe haven to regroup and re-arm following battles with Syrian troops.
Turkey-Syria ties strained by violence
Damascus 'in a bubble' as Syria implodes
Syria blasted at U.N.
Embattled Syrian city shaken by blasts
Another explanation, says one expert, is that in a cat-and-mouse pursuit to neutralize rebel groups near the border, Syrian artillery units simply overshot their target.
"These things happen in the fog of war," Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, told CNN. "If your artillery battery is 10 kilometers away and you're trying to call a strike down on the border, it's pretty easy to put a few rounds in the wrong place if you put in the calculations wrong."
Opinion: Why Turkey, Syria don't want war
The incident prompted the Turkish parliament to give the government powers to authorize troops to deploy to foreign countries, along with retaliatory Turkish artillery strikes on military positions in Syria -- but both sides have insisted they don't want war.
Which country, Syria or Turkey, has the stronger military?
Turkey, a NATO member, has the most powerful military in the region. Binnie says Turkey flies Western-made jets, and that its older equipment has been upgraded and supplemented with early-warning radar airplanes and unmanned drones.
Turkey also has a formidable ground force that has spent decades fighting the Kurdish separatist rebels of the KPP in the southeast of the country.
Analysis: Kurds add explosive element to Syria equation
Despite their robust military capability, and despite the fact the Syrian army has been worn down by 18 months of civil war, Binnie says Syria's missile capabilities mean Turkey's not interested in anything more than limited border excursions.
"Turkey wouldn't want to tangle with the Syrians, who do still have the ultimate deterrent of long-range chemical weapons capabilities," he told CNN.
What weapons do Syrian forces have? Where are they coming from?
Syria's greatest strength has also been its weakness in the current fight against rebels.
The Assad regime spent years buying up sophisticated long range missiles, air defense systems and chemical weapons to counter the threat of an airborne attack from Israel.
But the long-term focus on long range weaponry has left the regime unprepared to fight a guerrilla war in the streets of Syrian cities -- an approach that requires flexible, mobile infantry with stockpiles of smaller arms.
Syria has been the Middle East's top importer of Russian weaponry, most of which is now more than 20 years old -- and Binnie says the Syrian air force has been underfunded to the point of "regime forces dropping what amount to IEDs (improvised explosive devices) from helicopters."
Recently, Syria has attempted to get some of its Mi-24 attack helicopters refurbished by Russia -- a move which prompted an international outcry -- and has ordered Yak-130 advanced training jets and MiG-29 fighter jets that have yet to be delivered.
While the Kremlin has pledged not to deliver new weapons to Syria, it is unclear whether the Assad regime will get the weapons it ordered before the uprising began last year.
Syria's heavy weaponry and battle tanks may be Russian made, but wars of attrition like this also require huge amounts of small arms.
To that end, Iran -- Syria's other major regional ally -- has been using Iraqi airspace to fly small arms, infantry weaponry and personnel into Syria, according to U.S. officials.
Analysis: What does Iran get for supporting Assad?
Iraq says it is conducting random searches on Syrian-bound Iranian planes that use its airports, but as Binnie points out, "the Iraqis don't have any way to force Iranian planes to land."
NGO running Syrian 'Fast and Furious'?
Syrian refugees struggle to find haven Conflict has changed Assad, says friend
Ancient Syrian ruins destroyed In addition to the tanks and troops fanned out across the country, Syria has also deployed communications interception systems to try to track rebels. CNN reporters who have been on the ground there say for the most part using a cell phone is out of the question, as Syrian forces can easily triangulate the user's location.
What weapons do Syrian rebels have? Where are they coming from?
The rebels are severely outmatched, and most of their weaponry was either taken from Syrian military arsenals or obtained from local black markets.
In addition to individual infantry weapons like AK-47s, tripod-mounted PK machine guns, and RPG-7 grenade launchers -- the ubiquitous shoulder-mounted weapons seen on nightly news reports from conflicts around the world -- Binnie says rebels have also been seen with Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles.
Rebels have also commandeered Syrian tanks, but since they don't generally have the capacity to maintain and refuel them, according to Binnie, they've instead been stripping off the heavier guns and mounting them on civilian vehicles.
Binnie says the increasing number of improvised weapons and explosives being used in Syria shows the rebels, without a foreign power to supply them, may be struggling to maintain adequate levels of ammunition.
"Some of the weapons in Syria look very similar to what we've seen in the last year in Iraq, where they've finally ran out of all the ordinates that were lying around from the 2003 U.S. invasion and have had to improvise," he told CNN.
What other groups are operating in Syria?
Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, says militant groups "of all persuasions" are now operating in Syria -- and that some groups increasingly appear to be carrying out joint co-ordinated attacks.
While Lister says the majority of the militias now in Syria are not Islamic extremists, analysts believe a hard-line jihadist group known as Jabhat al Nusra, which has claimed responsibility for a string of recent suicide attacks across Syria, has close links with al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq.
"Their focus now is on recruiting suicide bombers. They want to copycat the Zarqawi model," Noman Benotman, a former Libyan Jihadist now with the Quilliam Foundation in London, told CNN.
More: Pro al Qaeda group steps up bombings
The "Zarqawi model" refers to the devastating campaign launched by al Qaeda in Mesopotamia leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi after U.S. troops occupied Iraq.
At the same time, Kurdish militias now control at least 10 towns and cities in north-eastern Syria, some near the Turkish border -- an issue Lister says is "of significant concern to Ankara", which has been battling Kurdish separatists along its borders for decades.
Report: Turkey's Kurdish conflict turns deadlier
Is Assad losing control of the Syrian army?
Not yet, it seems. Despite some high profile defections, Binnie says "we haven't seen significant Syrian army units going across to join the rebellion."
Binnie says: "The speculation is that the Syrian army is focused on keeping itself together more than deploying some of the potentially less reliable units into rebel held areas."
Like most of the nation itself, the majority of Syria's conscripted army is Sunni Muslim. Rather than send some less-than-keen battalions in to kill their own countrymen, Binnie says the approach may be to have the army bombard cities from afar, before sending in loyal militias to do the up-close fighting street to street.
"You give the militias the weapons and the mobility, and you just make sure that the army units which are largely Sunni conscripts just stay together," he told CNN.
The plan seems to be working; Binnie says many people have been surprised at how well the army has managed to maintain its cohesion during the rebellion.
Is Syria going to end up like Libya?
The world cheered the fall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi -- but what has been left in his place are a number of well-armed militias operating beyond the control of a relatively weak central government operating in the capital Tripoli.
Analysts don't believe the Assad regime is in danger of collapse any time soon -- Syria's army is bigger and better organized than Gadhafi's was in Libya, and foreign intervention into the civil war seems extremely unlikely at this point.
But if the regime does fold at some point, Binnie says the weapons proliferation in Syria is going to be far worse than in Libya.
"Syria has a much bigger military, more missiles and chemical weapons, and the potential for major sectarian violence," he said. "So it's a little like Libya, but potentially much, much worse."

Obama judicial nominees likely to reignite controversy

Republican opposition has delayed confirmation of several of President Barack Obama's federal court nominations.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Nominees include one whose selection was blocked twice already in Senate
Judiciary Committee chair urges Senate to stop holding up nominations
Republicans blamed for blocking nominees, but White House said too slow
Moderates say unfilled vacancies create crisis in courts staffed by too few judges
Washington (CNN) -- In a move likely to reignite the political battle over judges, President Barack Obama on Thursday renominated 33 people to the federal courts, including a New York lawyer twice blocked by Republicans worried she would be an "activist" on the bench.
Caitlin Halligan was one of two nominees named again by Obama to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seen by many as a professional steppingstone to the Supreme Court.
Halligan is currently general counsel for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in New York. She would fill the seat vacated by John Roberts, who joined the Supreme Court as chief justice in 2005.
In his announcement, Obama said his nominees should have been given up-or-down Senate votes before the 112th Congress adjourned.
"Several have been awaiting a vote for more than six months, even though they all enjoy bipartisan support. I continue to be grateful for their willingness to serve and remain confident that they will apply the law with the utmost impartiality and integrity," he said. "I urge the Senate to consider and confirm these nominees without delay, so all Americans can have equal and timely access to justice."
By law, the president must resubmit nominations that did not receive floor action in the previous session of Congress.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, last week urged Republicans not to stop Obama's pending nominations.
"There are more judicial vacancies now - 75 - than when President Obama was sworn into office four years ago," said Leahy. "The nominations of too many qualified judicial nominees have needlessly languished on the Senate calendar."
Chief Justice laments 'fiscal cliff' effects on federal courts
In a rare move, Senate Republicans voted in December 2011 to block Halligan the first time she was tapped for the court, complaining the 46-year-old Ohio native was too liberal and would be an activist on the bench.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said at the time that Halligan met the "extraordinary circumstances" standard for a filibuster under a 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases.
McConnell complained about Halligan's legal positions on gun rights, detainee rights, and immigration and said she would bring an activist agenda to the court.
Democrats had defended Halligan as a "superbly qualified nominee," in the words of Leahy. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, called her a moderate and said Republicans have distorted her record.
Halligan's 2012 renomination languished without action, typical of an election year, when confirmations for a variety of political and practical reasons are given a lower legislative priority.
Also renominated for the D.C. Circuit is Sri Srinivasan, the principal deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department, who has argued more than 20 cases before the Supreme Court. He would be the appeals court's first Asian-American, if confirmed.
Republicans had been criticized for delaying floor votes on many nominees in the president's first term in office. But the White House, too, has come under fire for not moving quickly to fill growing bench vacancies.
Some moderates from both parties have long lamented threats of delays and filibuster attempts of most presidential appointments. They say ongoing vacancies have created a crisis in many federal courts, with bulging dockets being handled by too few judges.

Egypt on edge after at least 278 killed in bloodiest day since revolution
By Greg Botelho. Josh Levs and Ian Lee, CNN
updated 10:51 AM EDT, Thu August 15, 2013
Protesters and Egyptian riot police clash in Cairo on January 17, as the country awaits the results of a constitutional referendum. On January 18, the electoral commission announced the constitution had overwhelmingly been approved.
An Egyptian youth holds up his national flag outside a polling station in Cairo on January 14, day one of a two-day vote on a new constitution. On December 25, 2013, The Egyptian interim government declared the Mohammed Morsy-led Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. The action was taken in response to a police station bombing in Mansoura, which the government has stated was the responsibility of the Brotherhood, despite denials from the group itself. Cairo University's students backing ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsy flash the four-finger sign during a demonstration against July's military "coup " in Tahrir square on December 1, 2013. The four-finger sign has become associated with a government crackdown on pro-Morsy supporters in Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya square on August 14.

A soldier sets up barbed wire in anticipation of protesters outside the constitutional court in Cairo on Sunday, August 18, 2013. During the previous week about 900 people -- security forces as well as citizens -- had been killed. Deaths occurred when the military used force to clear supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsy from two sit-in sites in Cairo, and violence raged after Morsy supporters staged demonstrations.
Friends and relatives of Ammar Badie, 38, killed during clashes in Ramses Square, carry his coffin during his funeral in Al-Hamed mosque in Cairo on August 18, 2013. Ammar Badie was the son of the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader, Mohammed Badie.
Wreckage and debris litter the area around the Al-Fateh mosque in Cairo, where hundreds of Islamist protesters had barricaded themselves on Saturday, August 17, 2013. Thousands defied an emergency order by taking to the streets the day before to mark a "Friday of anger" in support of ousted president Mohamed Morsy.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Morsy backers attack police stations, hospitals early Thursday, state TV reports At least 235 civilians and 43 police officers die in violence Wednesday, officials say Morsy backers say they came under "assault;" government calls protesters the aggressors
Diplomats worldwide condemn the bloodshed, urge restraint

Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt, including its capital Cairo, teetered on the edge early Thursday as clashes persisted following the bloodiest day since the revolution two years ago that was envisioned to bring peace and democracy to Egypt -- but has not.
The violence Wednesday pitted Egypt's military and current government against backers of deposed President Mohamed Morsy, though others also were caught in the fray.
At least 278 people were killed, including 235 civilians, state TV reported, citing an Egyptian emergency official. Interim Interior Minister Gen. Mohammed Ibrahim said that an additional 43 police officers died.
"It's an open war," said a protester who escaped one of two Cairo camps that were raided.

The intensity and violence lingered into Thursday morning, when state TV reported Morsy backers were attacking police stations, hospitals and government buildings despite a government-mandated curfew. More Egyptian troops were being deployed at entrances to Cairo and Giza, with the unrest prompting the closure Thursday of banks and the nation's stock market.
The 2011 revolution that led to the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, who'd kept a firm grip on power for 30 years, was followed by Egypt's first democratic elections. Morsy -- a leader of the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood -- won the presidency in that 2012 vote, but was forced out by the military last month.
Morsy hasn't been seen since he was taken into custody. Yet his supporters have very public in voicing their opinions, massing on the streets of Cairo and elsewhere to slam military leaders and demand Morsy's return to the presidency.
Egypt's new government refused to back down, criticizing elements of the protest movement and specifically ordering them to leave two spots where they'd been gathering in Cairo for six weeks, or else they'd force them out.
On Wednesday, they did.
Bloody 'war zone' as security forces clear Cairo square
The story of what exactly transpired -- who attacked whom, who opened fire, who was to blame -- varied 180 degrees depending on where one stood in the debate over Egypt's past, present and future.
On the one side, there were Morsy supporters, one of whom accused government forces of waging a "full-on assault" on what they said had been, to-date, peaceful demonstrations. On the other, there were those like Ibrahim, who professed to being "surprised" by the "Muslim Brotherhood's (decision) to attack the security forces."

Chaos in Egypt as security forces move in

Mohamed Tawfik: This was least bad option
Egypt's tale of turmoil since 2011
What couldn't be mistaken was the chaos, the bloodshed and the sense -- even with Prime Minister Hazem Elbeblawi's pledge "we hopefully will rebuild our nation" -- that the already volatile situation in Egypt could be getting worse.
"I think what we're seeing right now is just the beginning of what is promising to be a very, very long and bloody battle as the interim government and the security forces try to regain control of the streets," CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Cairo.
Diplomats condemn violence, calling it 'deplorable'
The government on Wednesday, according to state TV, issued a month-long state of emergency. This a loaded term in Egypt, given that Mubarak long ruled under such a decree that barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and let police jail people indefinitely.
The prime minister said the government felt compelled to act to ensure stability, praising security forces for their "calm" and claiming some activists had intent to undermine the government.
"We are here to build a democracy based on justice," Elbeblawi said. "... We have to reason and use common sense. We are all part of this nation."
Yet not everyone expressed faith in his government.
Mohammed ElBaradei -- a secular leader who was one of Morsy's biggest critics before joining the government that replaced him -- submitted his resignation Wednesday as vice president of foreign affairs, saying he didn't agree with decisions being carried out by the ruling government and "cannot be responsible for a single (drop of) blood." His decision spurred scorn from some former allies, with youth groups and June 30th coalition members questioning his stepping down "at this critical and historic phase," according to state-run EGYNews.
Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, sharply criticized "ongoing violence" by Brotherhood supporters against Coptic Christian churches in the country. He also chastised the government's crackdown on the Islamist group.
"Didn't have to happen," Roth tweeted. "MB had right to protest. No need for massive lethal force."
World urges Egypt to show restraint, protect civilians
The European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, urged "security forces to exercise utmost restraint and ... the interim government to end the state of emergency as soon as possible, to allow the resumption of normal life."
In light of the ongoing violence, the United States is considering canceling next month's planned biennial military training exercise with Egyptian forces, an official in President Barack Obama's administration said.
Pressing Egypt's government "to respect basic human rights," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Wednesday's "deplorable" events "run counter to Egyptian aspirations for peace, inclusion and genuine democracy."
"The path toward violence leads only to greater instability, economic disaster and suffering," he said.

'They're prepared to die'
For weeks, the two makeshift Cairo protest camps had become cities unto themselves -- with people sleeping in tents, vendors hawking everything from haircuts to masks, and children playing in inflatable castles and splashing in kiddie pools.
At dawn on Wednesday, they came under siege.
Security forces rushed in, bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds. Some mothers and fathers managed to whisk away their children, gas masks on their faces.
Within three hours, the smaller camp -- Nahda, near Cairo University -- was clear, except for shreds of torn-down tents that remained.
But the larger protest, near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in eastern Cairo, proved trickier. Facing heavy resistance, the military called in special forces.
Chaos ensued. Along with smoke, bursts of rapid gunfire filled the air, as did people's wails. Many protesters refused to leave, even in the face of bulldozers and surrounded by the injured and dead.
"They said they're prepared to die," CNN's Reza Sayah reported.
State TV reported that snipers from the Muslim Brotherhood -- Morsy's party -- exchanged gunfire with Egyptian security forces near a university building.
The dead included cameraman Mick Deane, who'd worked for UK-based news channel Sky News for 15 years and for CNN before that. Habiba Abdel Aziz of Gulf News, who was in Egypt on her own time having celebrated the Eid holiday, also died, editor-at-large Francis Matthew told CNN.
And Reuters photojournalist Asmaa Waguih was shot and wounded, the news agency told CNN. She was being treated in a hospital.
'Walking on the blood of the victims'
Ibrahim, the interim interior minister, claimed armed protesters were the aggressors -- including trying to storm police stations, the Ministry of Finance building and other targets in Cairo.
The fighting wasn't limited to the capital. Morsy backers reportedly besieged churches in Sohag, setting fire to Saint George's Church, a tour bus and a police car, EGYNews said.
Naguib Sawiris, an Egyptian billionaire who helped found the anti-Morsy Free Egyptian Party, said his party had video of Muslim Brotherhood members "shooting machine guns on civilians, on police. So anyone who wants to call this a peaceful demonstration would be wrong."
But Ahmed Mustafa, a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, told CNN that Sawiris was trying to misrepresent video of masked people with weapons.
Besides claiming they'd been shot at, the Muslim Brotherhood also accused police of throwing Molotov cocktails at makeshift clinics.
Security forces pushed doctors out of one hospital at gunpoint, a witness said, and a CNN crew at one point was "literally walking on the blood of the victims."
Yet Ibrahim said government forces had done what they could to limit casualties, with his ministry insisting, "Egyptian security forces are committed to the utmost self-restraint in dealing with the protesters."
Divisions rife, future uncertain in Egypt
Rather than uniting Egypt after Mubarak's fall, divisions remained rife -- and, in some ways, intensified -- during Morsy's time as president.
Critics accused him of being authoritarian, trying to force the Brotherhood's Islamic agenda, not being inclusive and failing to deliver freedom and justice.
'Nail in coffin' for Arab Spring?
The military coup to dismiss him, they said, was necessary since Morsy didn't fairly represent all Egyptians. So, too, were the efforts to force his supporters off the streets.
"We believe in human rights," said Shehab Wagih, a spokesman for the Free Egyptian Party speaking in favor of the military. "But at the same time, we cannot accept the idea of having a state inside a state."
Morsy's backers, meanwhile, accuse the military -- and the government it appointed -- of undermining the people's will, as expressed at the polls. The deposed president wasn't given a fair chance, they say, and his supporters have been unfairly targeted for expressing their opinion.
Talking Wednesday on CNN, Abdul Mawgoud Dardery of the pro-Morsy Anti-Coup National Alliance blamed "corrupt elements" in the Egyptian army for the bloodshed, calling their actions a "crime against humanity" and "state terrorism."
"All presidents make mistakes, but you don't have the army to remove them," Dardery said of Morsy. "... What are we telling to the rest of the Arab world, the Muslim world -- that bullets are better than ballots?"
Opinion: Morsy holds key to Egypt's future
CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo; CNN's Greg Botelho and Josh Levs reported from Atlanta; CNN's Saad Abedine, Holly Yan, Barbara Starr, Ali Younes, Slma Shelbayah and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.

The CW just gave every new show a full season
By James Hibberd, EW
updated 11:19 AM EST, Tue November 12, 2013
"Reign" is one of the feshman primetime shows The CW has picked up for a full season.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The CW has grabbed up all of their freshman dramas
It felt like "The Tomorrow People" and "Reign" couldn't both survive
CW prez says "we have built a much stronger primetime schedule"
(EW.com ) -- The CW just gave every one of its freshman dramas a full-season order.
"The Originals"? Full season!
"The Tomorrow People"? Full season!
"Reign"? Full season!
The network is like Oprah giving away cars. Or Miley giving away tongue wags. Or something else that's easy to get from something that gives away stuff.
"The Originals" was a given. "The Vampire Diaries" spin-off has averaged 2.7 million viewers and a 1.3 rating among adults 18-49 and The CW needs to keep at least one show for a full season. With its solid-ishy performance, the drama was clearly headed toward a pickup.
"The Tomorrow People" (2.4 million, 0.9) and "Reign" (2.1 million, 0.8) felt like one might survive while the other might not. Not because either are doing really well, exactly, but because The CW has limited inventory to play with (The CW has Twilight-but-with-aliens-romance Star-Crossed and Lost-meets-Avatar-meets-Lord of the Flies drama The 100 in the pipeline). Specifically, many in the industry expected Reign to get beheaded.
Explained CW president Mark Pedowitz: "In just a few seasons, we have built a much stronger primetime schedule. Our on-air ratings are up year to year, and our digital viewing continues to grow exponentially. We're excited about the creative momentum the producers have established for all three of our new series, and now our fans will have the chance to see the full stories unfold for them this season. With the additional episodes ordered, plus two new dramas and new reality for midseason, we'll be able to continue our commitment to adding more original programming all year long."
