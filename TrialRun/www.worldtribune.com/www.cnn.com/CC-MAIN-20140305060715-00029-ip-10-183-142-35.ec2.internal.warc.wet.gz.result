(CNN) -- An air traffic controller in the Wyoming Air National Guard, Pedro Rampolla says he hopes to guide his family to better health.A history of family heart trouble worries Rampolla and his wife, Denise -- something they aim to address in the "New You Resolution" program. Doctors say the two should change their steady diet of fast food and frozen entrees, for their own good and for that of their children.Here's Rampolla's take on his typical lunch: "Fast food, Burger King, McDonald's."The complicating factor in this plan is the family's busy life. Rampolla recently returned from Iraq and is planning to serve on the local school board in addition to working full time.He and his wife are also raising four children, ages 7 to 14, all of whom play on soccer teams.Here are Rampolla's goals for the "New You Resolution":1. Keep a diary to figure out food pitfalls.2. Slow down the pace of family activity.3. Leverage his military discipline into personal dietary discipline.February 28 updateThroughout "New You," one of Pedro and Denise Rampollas' challenges has been getting their kids to eat the healthy food they've been serving.They got a little help recently, when Chef Billy of Cooking Light magazine shared some words of encouragement with their kids." 'Eat smart,' " he said. "Let's do it. And Dr. Sanjay's not going away. He's going to be back to check on you guys. And you don't want to mess with the doctor." February 21 updateRampolla didn't come into "New You" looking to lose weight or slim down. But he said that after seven weeks on the program, his clothes are fitting better. The key has been an effort to keep his portion sizes small, which he acknowledged is difficult."Its just that concerted effort, that gotta do it, gotta do it," Rampolla said.February 14 updatePedro and Denise Rampolla are finding time for regular workouts, but eating healthy food on a regular basis has been more difficult.Their secret weapon for keeping each other in line? Guilt."I know she's caught me a couple of times, like 'Hey, you didn't take your lunch, so what are you eating?' " Rampolla said. February 7 updateRampolla's dietician wants him to try eating six small meals per day rather than two or three big ones."Keep feeding the system, you keep it burning," Marsha Siegel told him.But Rampolla doesn't find these small meals satisfying, so he has been eating larger portions than his dietician advises.January 31 updateBalancing work, family and activities remains a struggle for Pedro and Denise Rampolla.Pedro has been eating healthier, though, and it's been 16 days since any Rampolla has had fast food.January 24 updateThe Rampollas are finding that preparing healthy food can take longer than serving packaged fare.To compensate, they are trying to plan their meals in advance."We can probably look at a whole month in advance and say, 'All right this day, this day, this day, this day,' " Pedro Rampolla said.He is offering to help more in the kitchen -- to his wife's surprise.January 17 updateThe Rampollas got fitness and cooking lessons in New York at the beginning of the "New You Resolution." They learned a recipe for fast and light lasagna that can feed their family of six.Because Pedro Rampolla is in decent shape from his military service, he said he hopes that eating more fresh foods will help him overcome his family's history of heart disease. He would like to persuade his kids to try these foods, too."When the kids don't go along with our food choices, then we end up going with theirs," Rampolla said. Story Tools

Happy big beak: Giant penguins dwarfed modern versions Story Highlights Fossil skulls unearthed in Peru in 2005 are that of two giant penguins One of the giants lived during one of the warmest periods in Earth's past The second giant resembled today's King penguin, standing 2� to 3 feet tall Fossils will help scientists better understand penguin evolution Next Article in Technology » By Marsha Walton CNN (CNN) -- Picture this: A giant penguin with a long, peculiar beak, lounging in the warm sun. The giant penguin Icadyptes salasi, right, and Perudyptes devriesi, left, are shown with a modern penguin. It could be a promotion for the next animated Hollywood movie. But this big bird is the real thing, its recently discovered fossils providing researchers with several scientific oddities. Not only are the birds extra large by modern standards, they thrived in one of the warmest periods in the past 65 million years. "We have this ingrained notion of a penguin on an iceberg in a cool sea. But for most of their long history, penguins were in situations of no ice, with maybe crocodiles near them," said Julia Clarke, assistant professor of marine, earth and atmospheric sciences at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Clarke, who studies the biodiversity of living birds, and colleagues in Peru and Argentina have described two species of extinct penguins that lived tens of millions of years ago. It was during a time when Earth was a lot warmer than it is today. The fossils were found in Peru in 2005. The larger of the two new species, Icadyptes salasi, lived about 36 million years ago on the southern coast of Peru. The skull that was discovered includes an intriguing beak that is almost a foot long. "The texturing on the bone of the beak is unlike any living penguin," said Clarke. The bird likely had more developed jaw muscles than current penguins, and probably ate large prey, including fish. The climate of the earth at that time was far different from the icy polar regions and the toastier, tropical middle section we inhabit today. "The global average temperature was much higher than at present," said Clarke. "And there was relatively little difference between the temperatures at the poles and the equator," she said. The Earth's first polar icecaps developed about 34 million years ago, after these two penguin species became extinct. The other newly discovered species, Perudyptes devriesi, is even older, inhabiting the planet 42 million years ago. It resembled one of the largest contemporary penguin species, the King penguin, standing two and a half to three feet tall. Its fossils show that its wings may have looked a little different from the very specialized "paddles" that the wings have become today. Clarke emphasized that because some penguins on the lower branches of the birds' family tree lived well in warmer temperatures, it would be a colossal mistake to believe that penguins now living could simply adapt to the changes brought about by global warming. "What happened over millions and millions of years cannot usefully inform us about what may happen over just the next 1,000 years," she said. "The data from these new fossil species cannot be used to argue that warming wouldn't negatively impact living penguins." These penguin fossils may change understanding of just how and where these flightless birds evolved. Until now, researchers theorized that penguins evolved in high latitudes in New Zealand and Antarctica, eventually moving to warmer areas nearer the equator about ten million years ago. That would have been 24 million years after the transition from very warm temperatures in the Paleocene and Eocene eras to major planetary cooling and the appearance of permanent North and South Poles. So what does a vertebrate paleontologist think about all the attention penguins are now getting with pop culture hits like "March of the Penguins" and "Happy Feet"? "Anytime people are motivated to engage and become emotionally connected to the natural world is a good thing for conservation concerns," said Clarke. The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It was funded by the National Geographic Society, and the National Science Foundation Office of International Science and Engineering. E-mail to a friend All About Birds

Pakistan raids camp over Mumbai attacksStory Highlights Source says 15 people arrested on raid on camp in Kashmir First sign of action on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, blamed by India for Mumbai attacks Death toll in attacks revised down to 164Next Article in World » Read VIDEO From CNN's Reza Sayah	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan is continuing to conduct raids on targets linked to the outlawed group that India blames for last month's massacre in Mumbai, a Pakistani security official told CNN on Monday. Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman from the attacks claimed he was trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Raids took place Sunday near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the sources said. A Pakistani military official said 15 people were arrested in the raid but he would not identify any of the suspects until the preliminary investigation has concluded. It is the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, the Islamic militant group India says was behind the killings of more than 160 people in Mumbai, since last month's attacks. iReport.com: Share your reaction to the attacks Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the attacks has told investigators that he was trained by LeT, which was banned following a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of war. Initial reports indicated Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a suspected mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, was arrested although it was later denied by CNN sources. The camp raided was owned by Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity formed after the ban. The group says it uses the site as an office for relief work in an area hit by a major earthquake in 2005 but it did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. LeT was formed to fight Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir, the flashpoint for two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought since independence.

It has denied any responsibility for Mumbai attacks, and Pakistani authorities deny the attackers were from their country and blamed "non-state actors" for the killings. India revised the death toll from the attacks downward Monday to 164, including 120 Indian civilians, 26 non-Indians and 18 troops and police officers who died in three days of battles with the attackers. Nine of the gunmen involved in the attacks were killed as well, according to Mumbai police. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pressured Pakistan to take action against militant groups within its territory during a visit to India and Pakistan last week. She told CNN's "Late Edition" on Sunday that while there are "historic ties" between the Pakistani government and LeT, "Pakistan is a different place now," with a civilian government working to crack down on militants within its territory. "We have to remember that Pakistan itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism. So whatever the history here, and there is a history, the important thing is that Pakistan act against those who used Pakistani soil to perpetrate attacks."

'Training Day' director gives kids a chanceStory Highlights Antoine Fuqua started program for young filmmakers Fuqua ("Training Day") gives kids a motto: "No excuses" Fuqua: "It's like the world is starting to open up" for the children Next Article in Entertainment » Read VIDEO By Denise Quan CNN	LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When director Antoine Fuqua rolls into a community to shoot a movie, he becomes part of that community. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua began a program to foster young moviemakers in poor communities. This isn't the case of a Hollywood filmmaker cherry-picking glamorous locations like Beverly Hills or Manhattan. Fuqua's interests lie a few miles away, in the grittier section of town. For his 2001 blockbuster, "Training Day," he took stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke and shot in South-Central Los Angeles -- deep in the 'hood. And last year, the housing projects in Brooklyn's Brownsville district were key to his latest feature, "Brooklyn's Finest." Hawke stars once again, this time alongside Richard Gere, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes. Although Fuqua carries himself with the confident ease of someone who enjoys a certain stature in the industry, he's at home in the projects. And he should be. He was raised in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, public housing complex, and hasn't forgotten what it's like to dream about making it out of the ghetto. Yet now that he's out, he wants back in. Watch more about how Fuqua mentors young filmmakers » During the filming of "Brooklyn's Finest," he initiated the non-profit Fuqua Film Program -- an intense, 12-week moviemaking course eligible to young adults from Brownsville, ages 16 to 20. Last year, three students got the chance to write, direct and edit their own short film. This year, he hopes to expand the program to 10 to 15 students. Down the road, he's looking to bring the project to his native Pittsburgh, then roll out to other urban areas. After all, in Hollywood, it's all about who you know -- and Fuqua wants to give neighborhood kids the opportunity to know him. The following is an edited version of an interview CNN did with Fuqua. CNN: What was so compelling about the kids you chose to participate in the Fuqua Film Program? 'Black in America 2'
In July, Soledad O'Brien investigates what African-Americans are doing to confront the most challenging issues facing their communities. You'll meet people who are using groundbreaking solutions in innovative ways to transform the black experience. Wednesday, 9 p.m. ET & Thursday, 8 p.m. ET
see full schedule »
Antoine Fuqua: We selected three kids -- four kids, actually (one could not complete the program because he was sent to Juvenile Hall). ... The concept was to have them write an essay to find out which ones really had the passion for filmmaking. Most of the applicants were 18, 19 years old. Some lost their parents when they were 13, 12, 10. A few were involved in gangs -- or someone in their family is involved in gangs. A young lady just wanted to find a way out of living in the projects, and she wanted to go to college. So it was a number of things I found compelling, but most of all, they all had a little bit of light and a little bit of hope in each letter. CNN: When you handed the participants their video camera, you talked about "No excuses." Fuqua: Right. "No excuses." Exactly. That concept came from my parents and my grandmother -- the idea that you can't make excuses for things you don't have. You just have to go get 'em. ... If they go after it -- as they did with the essays -- someone's going to hand you a tool and say, "Here you go. Now what?" And then it's up to you to prove that you have what it takes. CNN: You've got the teens who are part of the program, and then you have a bunch of little kids (from the neighborhood) who were interested in what was going on, too -- the next generation. Fuqua: (Laughs) The next generation, yeah. They kind of took over the director's chair. I was over directing the actors, and I happened to turn around, and I just saw all these kids all around my monitor, and I said, "Well, sit down, go ahead. Put the headsets on. You know, if you're going to be here, you can listen and hear what's going on." And they loved it. I'd see them smiling, and laughing, and every time I yelled, "Cut!" they were clapping. And then a few of them would yell, "Cut!" and "Action!" I like to just go in there and say, "This is all happening in your neighborhood, these two, three hundred crew members -- black, white, every other color." You know, a crew is like a United Nations. It's an immediate opportunity to meet and greet people other than the ones you see every day in your community. We're there at four or five in the morning. We leave whenever we finish, which is normally in the middle of the night sometimes. So they see that dedication and that work ethic, and they see how we all get along and how we all have to communicate. And somewhere, I believe, it affects their behavior and how they deal with their lives. CNN: Did anybody do this for you? Fuqua: I'm just like them. I come from the projects in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the Hill District, so I know what it feels like to walk into these concrete buildings (the housing projects) and think that's the world. My goal is to show them that's nothing -- that's a blip in the world. ... Several people gave me opportunities. Mario Van Peebles was doing a little film in Pittsburgh and I was just a little kid running around, and I got to meet him. He was acting in it, and he was really nice and said hello to everybody. It wasn't a situation where they said, "Go away! You can't be part of this." CNN: On the set of "Brooklyn's Finest," Denzel Washington spent time talking to the kids. Fuqua: Yeah, Denzel was giving them the real talking. ... He's involved with the Boys and Girls Club, and he does a lot quietly -- people don't even know. When I shot "Training Day," he was, "Absolutely you've got to shoot down there [in South-Central] -- where else you gonna shoot it?!" And I remember one day down on the set with Denzel, I was filming and I couldn't find him, and I looked up on the porch, and he was up there on the porch with all these older women, and they were cooking for him, and all the young kids were around, and he was just hanging out where all the people were. And that told me right away what kind of person he was. I don't know how many times he was in his trailer. He was always with the kids -- him and Ethan (Hawke, his co-star) -- hanging out with everyone. And that influenced me a lot because I realized by watching the effect they had on these kids. CNN: What's been the most gratifying part of being involved in the community, and picking the kids for the Fuqua Film Program? Fuqua: I'm satisfied when I hear them talking about wanting to go to Europe, or curious of who Caravaggio is -- the painter -- or tell me they saw a Kurosawa film last night, and they never saw him before. You know, it's like the world is starting to open up -- their eyes are opening up. Maybe one of those kids is going to be the next Steven Spielberg, or the next Denzel, or who knows -- the next Antoine.

Gulf Coast birds in dangerBy Frank Gill, Special to CNN A Louisiana Heron flies above the fragile wetlands in the path of the oil spill that is creeping toward the coast of Louisiana. STORY HIGHLIGHTSOffshore oil rig explosion may produce long-term environmental devastationMassive oil slick threatens coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and FloridaGill: If birds are in trouble, so are weGill: "It's time to ... move toward a future powered by cleaner, renewable sources of energy"Editor's note: Frank Gill, PhD., is interim president of Audubon. Frank was Audubon's chief scientist until his retirement in 2005, and has been a member of Audubon's national board of directors. He is the author of a textbook, "Ornithology," and more than 150 scientific and popular articles. (CNN) -- Humans have always looked to birds for joy, inspiration and comfort, but if we look toward the birds of the Gulf Coast today, we feel no comfort, only a deep and growing unease. What began on April 20 with the horrific loss of 11 human lives in the explosion of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon now threatens to become a devastating and far-reaching environmental disaster -- one that should shake the American people to our very core. Hour by hour, a massive oil slick is spreading to the fragile coastal wetlands and barrier islands of the Mississippi River Delta in Louisiana. Coastal areas of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are also at risk. Birds are key indicators of the environment in which they -- and we -- live and eat and breathe. Their health or decline eventually mirrors our own, and the diagnosis this week isn't looking very good. The spreading oil threatens "Important Bird Areas," sites identified by Audubon and other conservation experts as vital to the health or even the survival of entire species. Coastal bird species -- graceful terns, gangly pelicans, peaceful plovers -- have everything to lose if the oil reaches them. It is breeding season for these year-round coastal denizens, and it is also peak migration season for millions of other birds headed north, right through the areas that may be hardest hit. A host of well-known species are at risk, among them: • Brown pelicans, the state bird of Louisiana, are incubating eggs on barrier islands. The species was removed from the endangered species list late last year -- a victory to be sure -- but nevertheless faces an uncertain future. • Reddish egret, a tall, colorful bird that "dances" wildly in the surf as it hunts for prey, is a scarce denizen of warm, salty coasts. • Royal terns, and several of their relatives, nest on beaches and dunes and catch small fish by executing spectacular plunge-dives into the waters of the Gulf. But a dive into oily water could prove deadly for these beautiful creatures. • Mottled ducks, locally called "summer ducks" because they are the only ducks that breed along the Gulf Coast, living, feeding and nesting in coastal salt marshes where oil would have devastating consequences. • Seaside sparrows, tiny and secretive marsh birds, will have nowhere to go if the salt marsh edges they frequent are destroyed by oil. They would simply fade away. Why does it matter if birds are in trouble? Like most Americans, I believe that living things have intrinsic worth and should be celebrated and allowed to thrive. They add beauty and wonder to our world. But if that doesn't convince you, consider this: If birds are in trouble, so are we. The problem is simply too big to contain. Birds and marine life will die. Sensitive habitats will be damaged. Industries and families will suffer. Cleanup will cost billions and take months or even years. Long-term recovery is uncertain.

We commend the federal, state and industry personnel who are working long hours in difficult and dangerous conditions attempting to stop and contain the spill. However, everyone shares the sickening realization that even heroic efforts probably will not be enough to avert significant environmental damage. This disaster confronts us squarely with the risks to which we expose ourselves and our environment any time we drill for oil. As a nation, we must stop and consider what we've done, and what we will do tomorrow. We must pause and reflect on what places can truly be considered "safe" for oil extraction, having the courage to recognize that in some, the risks are simply too great and the resources too precious to spoil. Elected representatives must keep the picture of this spreading catastrophe in mind as they consider the path to our energy future. America's energy needs are great. But so is our concern for the people and nature imperiled by our addiction to fossil fuel. It's time to redouble our efforts to move toward a future powered by cleaner, renewable sources of energy that make the planet a safer place for us and all the life with which we share it. The images from the Gulf are tragic reminders that we cannot afford to wait. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frank Gill.

Charlie Sheen: 'Defeat is not an option' By the CNN Wire Staff Sheen show halted after radio rantSTORY HIGHLIGHTSProducers picked "a fight with the wrong guy""Sheen's statements, conduct and condition" led to the shutdown, CBS saysThe show's producer "can't handle the truth," Sheen tells TMZFour new episodes were to begin production next week Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen on Friday declared "we are at war" following canceled production of the hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" and his impending loss of $1.2 million per episode. "They know what they did is wrong," Sheen, who claimed he is clean, said in a call from the Bahamas to the "Loose Cannons" radio program. Producers cited Charlie Sheen's actions and statements when they announced they were calling off production for the rest of the season. "Defeat is not an option," Sheen said in the Friday interview with "Loose Cannons" host Pat O'Brien. "They picked a fight with the wrong guy. They are in absolute breach." "They kept telling me how to live my personal life," said Sheen, making repeated references to money he brought to the network. "It was a toxic environment for eight years."

Two and a Half Men
Television
The actor, who began rehab treatments at his home in the wake of an emergency hospital visit in January, told ABC's "Good Morning America" in text messages Friday he is going to show up for work anyway. Sheen appeared to challenge producers to take action Thursday when he went on a rant as a guest on "The Alex Jones Radio Show." "I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not," Sheen told Jones. The decision to halt "Two and a Half Men" was announced Thursday after Sheen spoke with the Jones show. "Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition, CBS and Warner Bros. Television have decided to discontinue production of 'Two and a Half Men' for the remainder of the season," the network and studio said in a joint statement Thursday. Warner Bros. Television is owned by Time Warner Inc., the parent company of CNN. CBS placed the sitcom on "production hiatus" after the actor began rehab treatments. The show had been scheduled to resume taping on four more episodes next week. It's not clear if "Two and Half Men" will return for a ninth season. Industry insiders estimate that the show has already grossed $400 million in reruns, putting total syndication fees for the 177 shows at a cool $1 billion. A Warner Brothers spokesman said that at least 250 members of the cast and crew will be out of work during the canceled production. Sheen said the employees should be focused, patient and to understand "there are ways to deal with these clowns and take all their money." Sheen said on the Jones show that he was dealing "with fools and trolls" and people with "loser lives." He also had some unkind words for Alcoholics Anonymous. "This bootleg cult, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, reports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math. ... Another one of their mottoes is 'Don't be special, be one of us.' Newsflash: I am special, and I will never be one of you! I have a disease? Bulls**t! I cured it with my brain, with my mind," Sheen told the show. The actor also went after show co-creator Chuck Lorre. A short time after the cancellation was announced, Sheen sent a statement to celebrity news website TMZ. "I gracefully ignored this folly for 177 shows," Sheen wrote to TMZ. "I fire back once and this contaminated little maggot can't handle my power and can't handle the truth." Sheen's battle with producers is in sharp contrast to the kind words he had for them earlier this month when he thanked network executives for their support. "I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people," Sheen said in a statement then. "Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'Thank you.' " Lorre had no comment Friday. Sheen's father, actor Martin Sheen, told Sky News earlier this week he likened Sheen's addiction to having cancer. "If he had cancer how would we treat him?" the elder Sheen asked. "The disease of addiction is a form of cancer and you have to have a equal measure of concern and love and lift them up. That's what we do for him." Addiction specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky told HLN on Friday that Charlie Sheen "is clearly manic." Pinsky said Sheen is exhibiting traits of advanced addiction, which he said has a grave prognosis without proper treatment. "When their workplace is affected, that's when you know things are really bad," said Pinsky, whose new HLN show premieres April 4. Another Sheen radio interview last week raised concern about the actor's stability. Sheen, talking on "The Dan Patrick Show," advised people to stay away from crack cocaine "unless you can manage it socially." He told Patrick then that he was ready to return to the show. "I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys," Sheen said. "Get me right now." Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" on the morning of January 27, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. While his representative blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain, he later announced the actor was undergoing rehab at home.CNN's Alan Duke, Aaron Smith and Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.

Gas prices down for most of U.S., but up in some Sandy-stricken areas
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 12:22 PM EST, Tue November 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The average nationwide gasoline price is down 7 cents over 2 weeks, a survey says
But prices are up in some areas hit by Superstorm Sandy, the Lundberg Survey reports
Long Island had the highest average in the latest survey
Memphis had the lowest
(CNN) -- Gas prices have dropped more than 7 cents over the past two weeks, but risen in some regions stricken by Superstorm Sandy, according to a survey published Sunday.
The new national average for regular gasoline is $3.47 -- down more than 36 cents over the past six weeks, the Lundberg Survey found.
"This latest decline comes mostly from weak gasoline demand," said publisher Trilby Lundberg, "both because we are in the lower demand season and have also lost our daylight saving time. Losing that puts a damper on driving."
Sandy's impact in the Northeast lowered demand as well, since many people were stuck at home, unable to drive.

But because there was also "great difficulty getting fuel to the end user point," gas prices went up in some of those same areas, she said.
The highest average price found by the latest survey was $4.18 for New York's Long Island. That average was up 26 cents from two weeks earlier.
Long Island generally has higher prices than the national average due to taxes.
The Lundberg Survey tallies prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide.
Good news should lie ahead for consumers around the country, Lundberg said.
"Pump prices may well drop some more form here -- unless crude oil prices get seriously spooked by Middle East conflict or another geopolitical issue."
The current nationwide average is 9cents above the average a year ago, "whereas most of this year it's been more like 16 cents," Lundberg said.
The city with the lowest average in the latest survey was Memphis, at $3.04.
Here are average prices in some other cities:
San Diego - $3.80
Seattle - $3.49
Las Vegas - $3.57
Denver - $3.35
El Paso - $3.36
St. Louis - $3.14
Boston - $3.69
Atlanta - $3.24
Miami - $3.42

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Beyonce brings some serious energy to the Super Bowl halftime show
Fellow Destiny's Child members join for part of the performance She closes it out with her solo hit "Halo"
(CNN) -- By the time the clock ran out on Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime performance on Sunday, the singer had put to rest doubts that she would give it her all.
The 31-year-old had been at the center of controversy leading up to her anticipated game day show thanks to her decision to use a recorded track when she performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration in January.
That left some questioning whether she'd do the same in New Orleans on Sunday, but Beyonce clarified that she would "absolutely" sing live during the game, something that seemed evident as she soared through a decade-plus of hits.

Ravens fans celebrate in the streets
Super Bowl ads that scored with viewers
Lights out! Play halts at Superdome
As the drumbeat to her single "Countdown" played in the background, an actual fan-made countdown sponsored by Pepsi ticked off the final seconds to her halftime set.
Perhaps in a nod to her noted perfectionism, viewers heard that "Excellence must be pursued, it must be wooed, with all of one's might and every bit of effort that we have" as Beyonce emerged atop a platform to take the stage.
She began her show solo, kicking things off with an a cappella version of her single "Love on Top."
Clad in above-the-knee black stiletto boots and a leather minidress, the 31-year-old strutted to the tune of "Crazy in Love," stripping down to little more than a leotard as she performed the familiar dance moves. Unfortunately for Jay-Z fans, the singer's husband didn't accompany her to perform his rap verse on the song.
The best (and the worst) halftime shows in Super Bowl history
But, as expected, Beyonce did host a Destiny's Child reunion on the Super Bowl stage. After performing the high-energy songs "End of Time" and "Baby Boy," the latter of which got special effects treatment, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams popped onto the stage to join their former groupmate.
Following a few vocal runs of "Bootylicious," the trio segued into "Independent Women, Pt. 1," the popular single that was also highlighted on the soundtrack of 2000's "Charlie's Angels" movie.
The reunited Destiny's Child paid homage by pausing to replicate the iconic silhouetted pose before swinging into "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)." Beyonce released that song as a solo artist, but Rowland and Williams joined in on Sunday's show.
Beyonce took back the reins from there, closing out with a performance of "Halo."
"Everybody, I want to feel your energy," Beyonce said as she asked fans to keep waving their hands in the air, many of whom were equipped with blue lights.
It was a swiftly paced 12-minute show.
Beyonce told press ahead of the show that she recognized how big of an opportunity she had with the Super Bowl halftime gig but that she felt ready.
"I'm trying to learn to live every moment, because these moments are not promised to us," she said. "I've had a 16-year career, and all of the things that I've done have prepared me for this. ... I'm ready."

Does formula mystery help keep Coke afloat?
By Ivana Kottasova, CNN
updated 7:55 AM EST, Wed February 19, 2014
Coca-Cola claims its formula is the "world's most guarded secret." The recipe, the company says, is now kept in a purpose-built vault within the company's headquarters in Atlanta.
Trying to copy Coke and crack the secret formula? Beverage makers have been trying to do that for over a century. Pictured here is a 1915 advertisement warning Coca-Cola drinkers about its "pirate" competitors.
The vault itself is surrounded by an exhibition themed all around the secrecy.
Muhtar Kent, the company's chief executive officer, shows the box containing the recipe, before it's placed inside the multi-million vault.
The vault's door features several high-tech security locks. Adding to the show factor is special lighting and fake smoke effect. Have you heard the one about Santa Claus wearing red coat because of Coca-Cola ad? Well, according to the company, this is a myth. Before the Coca‑Cola Santa was even created, St Nick had appeared in numerous illustrations and written descriptions wearing a scarlet coat. This 1937 advert shows Santa Claus raiding the refrigerator.
Coca-Cola is dominant in the world beverage market and has huge sponsorship deals -- like its decades-long partnership with FIFA.
The drink company also has a long-standing partnership with the Olympic committee. Pictured here is a Coca-Cola stall at Wembley Stadium during the 1948 Olympic Games in London.
Coca-Cola's marketing relies heavily on the mystery surrounding the formula invented by a Civil War veteran and morphine addict John Pemberton in 1886.

Coca-Cola -- the world's ubiquitous brown fizzy drink -- is staying afloat as the soda market shrinks
Many point to a marketing strategy around the so-called "secret recipe" as key to its resilience
It's never been patented, to keep the formula secret, but many say they have discovered the recipe
London (CNN) -- Coca-Cola -- the world's ubiquitous brown fizzy drink -- is staying afloat as the soda market shrinks, and many point to a marketing strategy around the so-called "secret recipe" as key to its resilience in a struggling industry.
The Coca-Cola Company, which published its full year result Tuesday, recorded a 5% drop in net income to $8.6 billion last year, down from $9 billion in 2012, as it faced "ongoing global macroeconomic challenges," according to its chief executive Muhtar Kent.
Volume grew 2% for the year, which it said was "below our expectations and long-term growth target," with sparkling beverages recording a slight increase of 1% -- led by Coca-Cola.
Globally, soda drink sales have been shrinking as consumers turn to water, fruit drinks and healthier alternatives. The trend has hit Coke and other market players such as PepsiCo and Dr. Pepper. And while its primary competitor, PepsiCo, depends on its snack business to buoy the declining soda sales, Coke announced further investment into its marketing.
Coke in a K-Cup? The business of the World Cup
In a tough market, one strategy that brand experts credit Coke's relative strength with is the mystery around the much-hyped "secret recipe."
"The very idea of mystery attracts attention, and is often seen as an element of quality," says social psychologist and marketing expert Ben Voyer, lecturer at London School of Economics and ESCP Europe Business School. "A typical consumer would think that it must be a valuable product if they are doing all these things to protect the recipe."
Coca-Cola's "secret recipe" story -- on which it has centered advertising campaigns and built into its corporate museum --- reaches back nearly a century. According to the multi-national's website, the original recipe was only written down in 1919, more than half a century after a reported morphine addict and pharmacist John Pemberton invented the drink in 1886. Until then, it was passed down by word of mouth.
The formula was finally committed to paper when a group of investors led by Ernest Woodruff took out a loan to purchase the company in 1919. "As collateral, he provided a written record of the Coca Cola secret formula," Coke said in a statement on its site.
Since the 1920s, the document sat locked in a bank in Atlanta, until Coca-Cola decided to emphasize the secret in its marketing strategy. 86 years later, Coca-Cola moved the recipe into a purpose-built vault within the World of Coca-Cola, the company's museum in Atlanta. The ambiance is made complete by red lighting and fake smoke.
Coca-Cola has always claimed only two senior executives know the formula at any given time, although they have never revealed names or positions. But according to an advertising campaign based around the recipe, they can't travel on the same plane.
The vault, like one straight from a film, has a palm scanner, a numerical code pad and massive steel door.
Mark Pendergrast, author of For God, Country and Coca-Cola, says this is the real deal.
Inside its walls, there's another safe box with more security features. And inside that, a metal case containing what its owners call "the most guarded trade secret in the world." A piece of paper with, according to Coca-Cola, a recipe inside.
But Mark Pendergrast, author of "For God, Country & Coca-Cola," is skeptical. "John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886, at the height of the patent medicine era, and one of the ironies of that name is that no one actually patented such creations," he says.
"They kept the formulas secret, partly in order to increase sales with a sense of special mystery and to prevent competition, but also to keep people from knowing how cheap the ingredients were and how large the profits," he says.
The company has never patented the formula, saying to do so would require its disclosure. And once the patent expired, anyone would be able to use that recipe to produce a generic version of the world famous drink.
"[The secrecy] creates a natural curiosity about the product itself. Consumers are more likely to try to find out the recipe," Voyer says, adding it creates a legend around Coca Cola's flagship drink.
The business behind the World Cup
Coke's new ad campaign: It's safe Scores of recipes have emerged through the decades. Their authors usually claim to have cracked the original recipe by getting hold of antique documents. So far, Coke has rejected all of them as fantasy, saying there is only one "'real thing'."
Mark Pendergrast's book includes two versions of the original formula. "One is a facsimile in the handwriting of Frank Robinson, the 'unsung hero' of Coca-Cola who named the drink, wrote the famous script logo, manufactured the drink in its early days, and advertised it," he says.
Does he think the recipe is genuine?
"Yes. I think that both of the Coca-Cola formulas in my book are the 'real thing,' versions of the original formula for Coca-Cola," he says.
"In the end, the exact formula isn't really the issue," he says. Pendergrast reiterates a tale told in his book, in which he speaks to a Coca-Cola spokesperson who points out that even if its competitors got hold of the formula, they wouldn't be able to compete. "Why would anyone go out of their way to buy Yum-Yum, which is really just like Coca-Cola but costs more, when they can buy the Real Thing anywhere in the world?," he was told.
