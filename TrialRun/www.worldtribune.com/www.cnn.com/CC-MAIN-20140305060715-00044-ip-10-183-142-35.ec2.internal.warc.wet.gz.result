Democrats had better fear Tea Party candidates By Roland S. Martin, CNN Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTSRoland Martin: Primary victories for Tea Party favorites have left Republicans stunnedDemocrats could be in a similar rude awakening in November, Martin saysMartin counsels Democrats to take anger fueling Tea Party candidates seriouslyEditor's note: Roland S. Martin, a CNN political analyst, is a syndicated columnist and author of "Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith," and the new book, "The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House." He is a commentator for TV One Cable Network and host of a Sunday morning news show. Democratic political operatives are excited and filled with enthusiasm over the prospects of running against several Tea Party candidates in November, suggesting the Republican nominees are so extreme and out-of-touch that there is no way they stand a chance of winning in November. Have you listened to the euphoria in Democratic circles since Christine O'Donnell's victory this week over the legendary Mike Castle, a congressman, former governor and the man considered absolutely unbeatable? The GOP establishment had already started measuring the drapes in his U.S. Senate office and was salivating at the chance to see Vice President Joe Biden administer the oath of office to the man who would occupy his Senate seat. But Castle is busying himself this week packing up his campaign office after O'Donnell dusted him in the Republican primary. The same has taken place in other races. In the New York Republican gubernatorial race, Rick Lazio was also considered a shoo-in to face New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in November, yet a Tea Partier with a racist streak in his body, Carl Paladino, beat the former congressman.

Christine O'Donnell
These victories, and others, have left the GOP establishment reeling, unable to figure out how the devil they danced with has now consumed the party. What was supposed to be party unity to target the Democrats is now a party civil war, complete with infighting, backbiting and finger-pointing. The political punditry has sounded the bell and declared that for Democrats, their potential loss of the U.S. Senate is now a false alarm, and O'Donnell's primary victory has assured the GOP they can't take it over. Such talk is hilarious to Dick Armey, the former Republican House leader who is the founder of Freedom Works, a conservative activist group aligned with Tea Partiers. I caught up with Armey in the airport Wednesday, and he had a Cheshire grin on his face as he talked about O'Donnell's victory. Armey, who didn't endorse anyone in the race, wondered how GOPers could be so angry, saying it was an open primary, O'Donnell had the right to run and only spent a fraction of what Castle did to win the primary. He said that in the end, it doesn't matter what polls say, pundits try to intimate or how much money you have. All that counts is if you have more votes than the other person. And he's dead right. That's why Democrats shouldn't see Tea Party candidates such as O'Donnell, Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharron Angle in Nevada as a firewall to keep them in power. What they should be doing is having a laser-like focus on their core supporters and driving them to the polls. iReport: Watch one teen's view of the Tea Party If they want to cast the Tea Partiers as out of the mainstream, go right ahead. I don't think that will work for a second. What will matter is that voters are, in the words of the late comedian Robin Harris, are "pissed off to the highest level of pissivity." This election will boil down to a rage that cannot be estimated about the economy. It was in shambles when President Obama took over, and is still dragging along like a ball and chain on our collective feet. If Democrats aren't focused, they'll look up and have to contend with Sen. O'Donnell, Sen. Rand and Sen. Angle. Falling asleep at the wheel in this rancorous and unpredictable election will result in nothing but disaster. Dems, you didn't pay attention to Scott Brown and look how that worked out for you in Massachusetts. You might not want to be as carefree about these races, lest you want to be like Castle and scratch your heads on November 3 and ask, "What in the hell just happened?" Share this on:

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
All options come with a hefty price tag "We must anticipate and be prepared for the unintended consequences," Martin Dempsey says Sen. John McCain says a no-fly zone over Syria is the most effective way
Washington (CNN) -- While the United States draws closer to providing some form of lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, the debate over how extensive the package should be and the possible outcome are likely to follow any decision.
In a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee this week, Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey laid out the scenarios that could unfold, ranging from the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria, to training and assisting the opposition through intelligence and logistics assistance.

None of the options, he said, would be easy, and all would come with a pretty extensive price tag.
"We must anticipate and be prepared for the unintended consequences of our action," Dempsey wrote in the letter to Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI).

Stemming the Syrian violence
"Should the regime's institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control."
Some advocates such as Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain say a no-fly zone over Syria is the most effective way to stop the killing machine of President Bashar al-Assad.

"I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly' zone, to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are, and establish a 'no-fly' zone with Patriot missiles," McCain said in June. "And if we can't do that, then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer, to the Pentagon, 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we can't even take care of this situation?'"
Pentagon's complex contingencies
But despite costs of such an operation possibly going as high as a "billion dollars per month over the course of a year" as Dempsey wrote in his letter to Levin, analysts say such an option faces other challenges.
Opinion: Time running out to aid Syria's rebels
Despite the risk to U.S. aircraft and recovery force personnel that may be associated with it, the military involvement in Afghanistan will not end until the end of next year. The Pentagon is also dealing with some complex contingencies in the context of Iran if diplomacy over Tehran's disputed nuclear program fails, as well as other volatile areas in the Middle East.
'Trading modernization against readiness'
The debate also comes at a time when forced budget cuts known as sequestration are shaving billions from the defense budget and forcing some military commanders to question whether the readiness capacity in fiscal environment can handle a new contingency.

"We are trading modernization against readiness, it's the only place we have to go for funding because of this arbitrary mechanism that is sequestration, and it's causing a real problem on the readiness side of the house and putting our ability to modernize over time at risk," Gen. Mark Welsh, chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, said last week at a security forum sponsored by the Aspen Institute.
Too little too late?
Some of the criticism over the administration's decision to send some form of lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, in a conflict that has claimed nearly 90,000 lives, and more than two years after the conflict began amounts to little more than too little too late.
"Right now, we're playing for the best worst option," Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview on the 'Situation Room' Tuesday.
'No guarantees in this business'
Frederic Hof, a former top State Department adviser on Syria, says it would have been better had President Barack Obama endorsed recommendations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and former CIA Director David Petraeus to arm mainstream opposition elements when they recommended it a year ago.
But acting and arming now is better than staying on the sidelines, Hof says.

"There are no guarantees in this business, but when you consider the costs of inaction, of trying to stand aside and watching this problem fester, it's clear to me that just trying to hold Syria at arm's length is every bit as risky as the alternatives, says Hof, now senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. "There are no good answers here, no silver bullets."
For Hof, the limited use of "targeted strikes" against specific elements in al-Assad's arsenal responsible for much of the killing, like artillery and missile strikes that reach heavily populated areas, would be an effective tool alongside the provision of small arms and training to the opposition.
"It kind of restricts the amount of expense and the amount of time because you will know with some degree of specificity when you have actually accomplished the mission," Hof says.
Billions of dollars
In his letter to Levin, Dempsey said the cost of such missions could reach billions of dollars, depending on the duration of the operations.
And then what about the disparate state of the Syrian opposition?
Much of the trepidation for greater involvement in the Syrian civil war was the presence of al Qaeda affiliated fighters within opposition ranks, and the danger of weapons falling into their hands.
"There is sort of an idea out there that all of the opposition are extremists," says longtime Syria watcher Andrew Tabler with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "They are not, but there are extremists among their ranks."
Who gets the weapons?
For Hof, the funneling of all weapons through Brig. Gen. Salim Idris, the supreme commander of the Syrian Military Council, whom the United States and the West see as an interlocutor, would be an effective organizing mechanism for the opposition.
"Up until now, things have come in with a variety of motives in mind -- different countries and kingdoms wanting clients inside Syria, and private contributors mostly from the [Persian] Gulf wanting to support jihadists," Hof says in advocating for a central figure to funnel everything through. "This is a big reason why there is chaos and disunity in the opposition ranks."
Obama to move forward with plan to arm Syrian rebels
Diplomatic solution still an option
That said, the United States is still pursuing a diplomatic solution through which a political transition would be brokered by all sides of the conflict as long as al-Assad had no role in any incoming government.
While the makeup of any transition government would not include anyone with blood on their hands, as called for by the Geneva Communique signed on to by the United States and other countries, the possible presence of some remnants of the al-Assad regime in a transition government causes pause for some analysts.
"I don't think it will be pulled off anytime soon," said Tabler, who says a process that allows the possible inclusion of regime elements in a new government over a population that has changed rapidly over the course of the last few years would be problematic. "It's just going to kick the can down the road, and we are going to be back to the same place we were before. But this time it will be with many more death tolls, so I just don't think it's viable."

Group Aims Its Ads -- Even If It Means Stealing Its Candidates' Show By Jackie Koszczuk, CQ Staff Writer
The American Insurance Association (AIA) has this to say to candidates who complain of losing control of their campaigns to well-heeled outsiders: Stop your whining and get used to it. That goes for the savvy trade group's friends as well as its enemies -- the pro-business Republicans who generally support its agenda and the labor-friendly Democrats who do not.
"The candidates are not the only ones who can talk about the issues. The political ruling class has to get a grip on life," says David Carney, a former Bush White House political director recruited by the AIA and some of its allies to run a new organization called Americans for Job Security.
Unlike other business alliances also planning issue advocacy campaigns this fall, Americans for Job Security plans to spend more money, start early, stay late and shape issues rather than merely respond to an opponent -- namely labor and environmental groups that used issue ads with gusto in the 1996 congressional elections.
The group's promotional material says that while others "play defense against the labor unions," it will "play offense, introducing a pro-business agenda to the public."
It plans to get involved in 15 to 20 races, running TV commercials promoting its top issues -- education reform, revamping the Internal Revenue Service, cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of government.
Taxpayers Featured
The organization already has run ads this year in two districts: in the Lois Capps-Tom Bordonaro special election in California's 22nd District and in Republican Rep. Nancy L. Johnson's 6th District in Connecticut.
It ran three TV ads in Johnson's district around the time of the April 15 deadline for filing tax forms with the IRS. In Harry and Louise fashion, the ads featured everyday Americans talking about their future pensions, about taxes so high that parents are forced to leave their children to go to work and about taxpayers' problems with IRS audits.
The ads, which ran every day for two weeks in the Hartford television market, do not urge a vote for Johnson, but they conclude with an announcer saying, "Join Nancy Johnson in the fight for real tax reform."
Johnson, a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and a strong supporter of a bill to revamp the IRS, will not know who her Democratic opponent is until the state's September primary, but she has had to slog through increasingly tough re-election races in recent years.
Chief of Staff Dave Karvelas said Johnson was initially concerned about the group's uninvited involvement but was relieved when she saw the ads. "It certainly is not going to hurt her to have ads on TV that recognize her accomplishments in tax reform," Karvelas said.
The same was not true for Bordonaro, the GOP candidate in California's 22nd District. Americans for Job Security was among the outside groups that fought among themselves in the Santa Barbara-based district, relegating the candidates to the status of secondary players.
Bordonaro, who lost to Capps, publicly declared that he wanted the outside groups to butt out, but that demand had no impact on Americans for Job Security's decision to run $40,000 worth of ads in the district.
The problem with the involvement of such outside groups, said Ed Gillespie, a top GOP communications strategist, is that "their goal is not always to win on Election Day so much as it is to influence public opinion. . . . And that in many cases can result in a loss for the candidate that is best for their issues."
Carney dismisses such arguments. He said, "That's an arrogant, elitist attitude. And I reject it as absolute hogwash."
Candidates would not be so worried, he said, if they stopped talking about school uniforms and started talking about school reform and other issues vital to everyday Americans.
Americans for Job Security is the brainchild of AIA President Robert Vagley, who came to believe that big business had to show as much initiative in 1998 as labor did in 1996.
He conceived of a five-year plan, during which the group would try to create a more receptive climate for issues such as regulatory reform by going outside the Beltway to appeal to the public. Americans for Job Security was created last October with the goal of raising $12 million in 1998 and $20 million in each of the four following years. The plan is ambitious, with its fundraising goals exceeding those of other politically active business groups.
Fundraising has not been as successful as organizers had hoped. "Asking a trade association for $1 million a year for five years, that's pretty rich for a lot of people's blood," said a prominent GOP lobbyist familiar with the group.
So far, Carney said, the group has more than $9 million in commitments from a dozen organizations, including a $1 million pledge from the American Forest & Paper Association, headed by former Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore, who was a Republican House member from Louisiana from 1975-87. One trade group official solicited by the group said its in-hand commitments were closer to $4.5 million.
One target is Wisconsin, where GOP Rep. Mark W. Neumann is trying to take Democrat Russell D. Feingold's Senate seat and where there are two open seats, Neumann's and retiring GOP Rep. Scott L. Klug's. Two Democratic freshmen in the state -- Ron Kind and Jay W. Johnson -- are also trying to stave off GOP challengers.
The organization's active strategy has been well-received by Republicans and lobbyists who think the strategy of another business group, The Coalition, only reacts to the unions and does not go far enough to promote a pro-business political agenda.
