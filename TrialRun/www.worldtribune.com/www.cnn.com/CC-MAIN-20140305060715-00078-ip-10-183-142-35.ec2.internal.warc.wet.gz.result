Obama says Dobson 'making stuff up'Story Highlights NEW: Dobson spokesman: Obama "is editing God's word to fit his liberal worldview" Obama fires back at Dobson, says he's "making stuff up" Obama camp offers to meet with Focus on the Family Obama has "a fruitcake interpretation of the Constitution," Dobson says Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO From Alexander Mooney CNN	(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama said evangelical leader James Dobson was "making stuff up," when he accused the Illinois senator of distorting the Bible and taking a "fruitcake interpretation" of the U.S. Constitution. James Dobson says Sen. Obama is distorting biblical teachings to fit "his own confused theology." "Any notion that I was distorting the Bible in that speech, I think anyone would be hard pressed to make that argument," Obama told reporters on board his press plane Tuesday night. Dobson spokesman, Tom Minnery, responded to Obama's latest remarks in a statement Wednesday. "There is no need to 'make stuff up' as it relates to Sen. Obama's interpretation of Scripture and the role of religion in the public square. His statements and record make clear his questionable perception of both. ... He is editing God's word to fit his liberal worldview, and the more exposure his views on these matters get, the more obvious this will become to American Christians." In comments aired on his radio show Tuesday, Dobson criticized the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for comments he made in a June 2006 speech to the liberal Christian group Call to Renewal. In the speech, Obama suggested that it would be impractical to govern based solely on the word of the Bible, noting that some passages suggest slavery is permissible and eating shellfish is disgraceful. "Which passages of scripture should guide our public policy?" Obama asked in the speech. "Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is OK and that eating shellfish is an abomination? Or we could go with Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount? "So before we get carried away, let's read our Bible now," Obama said, to cheers. "Folks haven't been reading their Bible." Don't Miss Analysis: Democrats woo disaffected evangelicals

He also called Jesus' Sermon on the Mount "a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our Defense Department would survive its application." In the comments aired Tuesday, Dobson said Obama should not be referencing antiquated dietary codes and passages from the Old Testament that are no longer relevant to the teachings of the New Testament. Listen to Dobson blast Obama's biblical interpretations » "I think he's deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own world view, his own confused theology," Dobson said, adding that Obama is "dragging biblical understanding through the gutter." Responding to Dobson's comments Tuesday evening, Obama sharply disputed the suggestion he was distorting the Bible. Who is James Dobson?

Mike Huckabee for president Has been critical of John McCainSources: CNN, Focus on the Family
"Someone would be pretty hard pressed to make that argument," he told reporters aboard his campaign plane. "It is a speech that affirms the role of faith not just in my life but in the life of the American people, that suggests that we make a mistake by trying to push faith out of the public square." "I do make the argument that it's important for folks like myself, who think faith is important, that we try to translate some of our concerns into universal language so we can have open and vigorous debate rather than having religion divide us," Obama said. "And I do suggest that the separation of church and state is important. But there's no, no theological work being done in that speech in terms of the Bible." Joshua DuBois, Obama's national director of religious affairs, said the Illinois senator is "committed to reaching out to people of faith and standing up for American families." "A full reading of his 2006 Call to Renewal speech shows just that," DuBois said. "Obama is proud to have the support of millions of Americans of faith and looks forward to working across religious lines to bring our country together." DuBois had earlier called Focus on the Family to suggest a meeting with the group ahead of the Democratic Party's convention in late August, according to Tom Minnery, the organization's senior vice president for government and public policy. Minnery wouldn't say whether any such meeting is planned but said the group is open to it. Dobson also takes aim at Obama for suggesting in the speech that those motivated by religion should attempt to appeal to broader segments of the population by not just framing their arguments around religious precepts. "Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion-specific values," Obama said. "It requires their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason." Dobson said the suggestion is an attempt to lead by the "lowest common denominator of morality." "Am I required in a democracy to conform my efforts in the political arena to his bloody notion of what is right with regard to the lives of tiny babies?" he asked. "What he's trying to say here is, unless everybody agrees, we have no right to fight for what we believe. "What the senator is saying there, in essence, is that 'I can't seek to pass legislation, for example, that bans partial-birth abortion, because there are people in the culture who don't see that as a moral issue,' " Dobson said. "And if I can't get everyone to agree with me, than it is undemocratic to try to pass legislation that I find offensive to the Scripture. Now, that is a fruitcake interpretation of the Constitution." According to Minnery, Dobson was particularly offended by a portion of the speech in which Obama mentioned evangelical leader and the Rev. Al Sharpton. In the speech, Obama said, "Even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's or Al Sharpton's?" In response, Minnery said, "Many people have called [Sharpton] a black racist, and [Obama] is somehow equating [Dobson] with that and racial bigotry." Dobson's comments follow the Obama campaign's recent efforts to increase its appeal among evangelicals, many of whom have expressed reservations about supporting Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Dobson himself has said he will not vote for the Arizona senator. Minnery said he doesn't expect Obama to make inroads into the reliably Republican voting bloc. "Evangelicals are people who take Bible interpretation very seriously, and the sort of speech he gave shows that he is worlds away in the views of evangelicals," he said. Minnery also said Dobson will probably continue his criticism of Obama. "Given our fact that religion seems to be such a relevant topic in this election again, we will defend the evangelical view vigorously," he said.

European World Cup 2010 qualifyingStory Highlights England secure World Cup berth with a 5-1 win over Croatia at Wembley Defender Pepe scored the only goal of the game as Portugal beat Hungary 1-0 Faroe Islands beat Lithuania 2-1 to earn their first qualifying win since 2001 Milan Baros scored four times as Czech Republic thrashed San Marino 7-0Next Article in World Sport » (CNN) -- Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard both scored twice as England booked their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, with an emphatic 5-1 victory over Croatia in their Group Six clash at Wembley Stadium. Frank Lampard scored twice as England booked their place at the 2010 World Cup with a 2-0 win over Croatia. Chelsea midfielder Lampard converted a penalty in the eighth minute after Aaron Lennon was brought down inside the box following a clumsy challenge from Josip Simunic. Gerrard added a second for Fabio Capello's side in the 18th minute when he headed home an excellent cross from the impressive Lennon. Lampard then rounded off a neat move with a close-range header in the 62nd minute, Liverpool midfielder Gerrard nodded the ball past Croatia goalkeeper Vedran Runje to make it four. Arsenal striker Eduardo scored a consolation goal for Croatia in the 71st minute with a simple tap-in after Robert Green had twice parried the ball before Rooney added a fifth, to seal the rout, in the 77th minute. Elsewhere, Ukraine could only close the gap on Croatia after they were held to a goalless draw by a resolute Belarus side in Minsk. Would the World Cup miss Argentina? In the group's other fixture Andorra remain without a point after they lost 3-1 at home to Kazakhstan as Sergey Khizhnichenko struck twice for the visitors. Portugal gave their hopes of qualifying from Group One a welcome boost with a 1-0 win over Hungary in Budapest. Brazilian-born defender Pepe scored the only goal of the game in the 10th minute to slightly ease the pressure on Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz.

Portugal's task though remains a difficult one as Daniel Majstorovic found the net nine minutes from time to help Sweden secure a vital 1-0 away win in Malta which keeps them two points clear in second place. Denmark saw their lead at the top of the group cut to three points after Erjon Bogdani equalized Nicklas Bendtner's first-half strike to give Albania a point in their 1-1 draw. France's hopes of automatic qualification now look unlikely after they could only manage a 1-1 draw with Group Seven leaders Serbia in Belgrade. Raymond Domenech's side were reduced to 10 men when goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was sent off for a foul on Nikola Zigic with Nenad Milijas converting the resulting penalty; Thierry Henry equalized to salvage a point. Suni Olsen and Arnbiorn Hansen were both on target for the Faroe Islands to give Brian Kerr's side their first qualifying win since 2001 with a 2-1 victory over Lithuania who had equalized through Tomas Danilevicius. Romania were unable to make home advantage count against Austria after they drew 1-1 with Austria in Bucharest as Franz Schiemer equalized for the visitors with eight minutes remaining after Gheorghe Bucur had put Romania ahead. Group Two leaders Switzerland needed a late goal from Eren Derdiyok as they picked up a point from a 2-2 draw with Latvia in Riga but second-placed Greece were unable to capitalize on the result as drew 1-1 away at Moldova. Elyaniv Barda hit a hattrick while Ben Sahar and Omer Golan both grabbed two goals apiece as Israel hammered Luxembourg 7-0 to remain in touch. Milan Baros scored four times as the Czech Republic thrashed San Marino 7-0 to keep alive their hopes of qualifying from Group Three. Galatasary striker Baros completed his hat-trick with a well-taken penalty before the half-time interval and then struck his fourth midway through the second half. Vaclav Sverkos grabbed a brace and fellow forward Tomas Necid also got his name on the scoresheet while San Marino defender Simone Bacciocchi was sent off late in the game after he was shown a second yellow card. Slovakia took a massive step towards qualification with a 2-0 win over Northern Ireland in Belfast thanks to goals from Stanislav Sestak and Filip Holosko while Slovenia moved ahead of Nigel Worthington's side into second spot with a 3-0 win over Poland. Germany remain top of Group Four after brace from Miroslav Klose gave them a comfortable 4-0 home win over Azerbaijan, although Russia remain only a point behind after they defeated Wales 3-1 in Cardiff. Turkey remain four points behind Bosnia-Herzegovina in Group Five after they could only manage a 1-1 draw away to their qualification rivals. Michele Polverino's goal for Liechtenstein cancelled out a penalty from veteran Finland striker Jari Litmanen to help his side secure their second point of the qualifying campaign with a 1-1 draw at the Rheinpark Stadion. A late goal from Daniel van Buyten was unable to prevent Belgium from slipping to a 2-1 defeat to Armenia as Hovhannes Goharyan and Sargis Hovsepyan both struck to give their side their first win of the campaign. Group leaders Spain cruised to a 3-0 home win over Estonia thanks to goals from Cesc Fabregas, Santi Cazorla and Juan Manuel Mata -- the win sealing the Iberian side's qualification to South Africa. Italy moved four points ahead of the Republic of Ireland in Group Eight as goals from Fabio Grosso and Vincenzo Iaquinta delivered a routine 2-0 win over Bulgaria while Cyprus drew 1-1 with Montenegro. Scotland are unable to qualify after they suffered a 1-0 home defeat to Holland in Group Nine while second-placed Norway remain in the balance despite a 2-1 win over Macedonia as the second-placed team with the worst record misses out on the play-offs.

Poll: Majority oppose controversial coal mining practice By Michelle Rozsa and Robert Howell, CNN Sneak peek: Battle For Blair MountainSTORY HIGHLIGHTSIn a CNN/ORC survey, 57% said they oppose mountaintop removal mining.In the same poll, 36% said they support the process.Recent studies show "multiple illnesses" found in mining areas.Editors note: Soledad O'Brien's documentary, "Battle for Blair Mountain: Working in America" airs at 8 p.m. ET Sunday, August 14 and 8 p.m. ET Saturday, August 20. Sharples, West Virginia (CNN) -- Charles Bella is a retired coal miner who now opposes the type of mining he used to do: mountaintop removal. "I believe that if they stop mountaintop removal now, it might be too late, but it would help. So much of southern West Virginia is already destroyed," Bella said. A new poll shows Bella is not alone in his opinion. Fifty-seven percent of respondents in a CNN/ORC survey released Thursday say they oppose the controversial mining process, in which a mountain is blasted apart and the debris deposited in nearby valleys. The coal is then dug out, and miners work to rebuild the slopes. About one-third of West Virginia's coal is mined this way. "They are probably not miners," Diann Kish said of the poll respondents. A neighbor of Bella's and the wife of a retired miner, she supports the process. Thirty-six percent agree with Kish, according to the poll. Seven percent didn't have an opinion. About one-third of West Virginia's coal is mined from mountaintop sites like this one. "Coal -- let me tell you, this fed our families," she said holding a baseball-sized chunk of the black mineral in her hand. "Doesn't bother me what other people think," Kish said. "It's not their livelihood." While the work has provided for families, it's not without its drawbacks. Recent studies by West Virginia University associate professor Michael Hendryx find "multiple illnesses" in mining areas. "Higher rates of cancer is one of them. Higher forms of chronic heart disease, heart attacks, and lung disease like (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), kidney disease," Hendryx said. "We have found evidence for all of those." "I think it really is the biggest public health problem that West Virginia faces," he added. RELATED TOPICS

Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association and a lobbyist for the coal industry, takes issue with Hendryx's findings. "I think what you find is there is a correlation as opposed to a causation and it's got to be analyzed," he said. He believes Hendryx's studies raise more questions than answers. Raney questions the validity of the CNN/ORC poll, too. "I think you have to spend some time explaining that mountaintop mining is authorized by federal law, has been for years," he said. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from July 18 to 20, with 1,009 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The poll's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

Rains soak, flood southern Louisiana
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 8:21 AM EDT, Tue March 13, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
More than 20 inches of rain possibly fall in some areas, the weather service says
A St. Landry Parish official estimates 2,000 people affected by the floods
A flood warning is in effect until late Tuesday
Floodwaters surround a bus filled with middle school students
(CNN) -- Record floodwaters inundated parts of southern Louisiana early Tuesday after intense rains caused flash flooding and prompted hundreds of rescues.
Estimates by the National Weather Service put total rainfall at 12 to 18 inches across the region, with possible amounts of 20 or more inches in some areas. A flood warning has been issued until late Tuesday.

Floodwaters were cresting overnight for Bayou Vermilion at Carencro at 5.5 feet over flood stage and 12 inches above the record set in May 2004.
"We're still conducting rescues," Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Kip Judice said Monday evening. "We've done over 150 rescues throughout the day today."
One of those involved 16 middle school students whose bus became stuck after more than 4 feet of water covered the road.
"It was really scary because we couldn't get out of the bus ... the water was closing it in," said student Cory McCall. "It was thundering and lightning."
Boats and dump trucks were used to reach the children and bring them to safety, Judice said.
The town of Carencro was among the hardest hit communities in Lafayette Parish, according to Capt. Craig Stansbury, who is also from the Parish Sheriff's Office. He noted there were reports of water as high as 8 feet on some roadways.
Stansbury said fire department vehicles, tractors and conventional boats and airboats were being used to reach those stranded in homes and cars.
"A lot of things that we have at our disposal, we're just going to go ahead and utilize," he said. "Whatever it takes to get to the people."
The parish declared a state of emergency in the midst of the high water.
"We are working with local officials to ensure they get the resources and support they need to respond to the flooding," said Kevin Davis, director of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. "We urge residents to be mindful ... and to take precautionary measures."
A state of emergency was also declared in St. Landry Parish, where Government Administrative Director Jessie Bellard estimated that some 2,000 people had been affected.
People were driving dump trucks to rescue residents who have flooding in their homes and can't get out. Bellard said several minor and major roads, including part of U.S. Highway 190, have experienced significant flooding.
"It's just a terrible situation," Bellard said.
Maj. Ginny Higgins of the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said flooding affected at least 15 to 20 roads Monday in that parish. Several people were safely rescued after being trapped in their vehicles, she said.
A state of emergency has been declared for that parish, Higgins said.
Stansbury, from Lafayette Parish, said residents knew Monday would be wet but didn't foresee the volume or intensity.
"There was a forecast of some heavy rains, but I don't think anybody could have predicted that amount of rain," he said.
And while the worst precipitation is over, the headaches are not.
Intermittent rain continued to fall.
Judice, from Lafayette Parish, said water levels were continuing to rise in his area.
"It's still a very crazy situation," he said.
CNN's Joe Sutton and Barbara Hall contributed to this report.

Small plane crashes into Florida Publix store
By Nick Valencia, CNN
updated 8:41 PM EDT, Tue April 3, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Police say there are "multiple" injuries in DeLand, Florida, crash
Publix spokesperson says all customers were evacuated safely
Two burn victims were being treated at the scene, TV station says
(CNN) -- "Multiple people" were injured after a small plane crashed into an Orlando area Publix supermarket Monday evening, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said.
"All customers were evacuated safely and all Publix associates are accounted for," Publix spokesman Dwaine Stevens said.
The store remained closed late Monday.
The first calls about the incident in DeLand, Florida, about 35 miles outside of Orlando, came about 7:20 p.m., Officer Brandon Haught with the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. Authorities were on the scene within minutes, officials added.
There was some "structural damage to the store's roof," Stevens said, but little else was affected.
Aerial video from local Orlando affiliate WFTV showed nearly a dozen emergency crew vehicles responding to the scene.
Two victims, both with third-degree burns, were being treated at the scene, according to CNN affiliate WESH, which cited Volusia County Sheriff's Office officials.

Was Cruz the show dog poisoned? His owner thinks so
By Dominique Dodley and Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 10:50 AM EST, Mon March 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sudden death of up-and-coming show dog puzzles owner, sparks talk of poisoning
Owner and handler suspect Cruz, a Samoyed, was poisoned
The vet who examined the dog says tests weren't done, so we'll never know
Activist decries the "creepy" world of dog shows
(CNN) -- It has all the trappings of a proper murder mystery: an attractive, up-and-coming victim, a sudden death, a mysterious stranger, whispers of poison.
Only this case involves a dog, the highly competitive canine show circuit and a professionally adorable Samoyed named GCH CH Polar Mist Cruz'n T'party At Zamosky -- Cruz for short.
The 3-year-old dog fell ill and died on February 16 in Lakewood, Colorado, barely a week after he appeared -- but didn't place -- in the prestigious Westminster dog show.
"I think somebody deliberately poisoned this dog," Cruz's handler, Robert Chaffin, told CNN on Friday.
Many dog breeds recognized by the Westminster Kennel Club are named for the work they were bred to do, such as pointers, retrievers and shepherds. But some dog breeds are not as obvious. Pembroke Welsh Corgis, for example, are well-known as the foxy, playful pet of Queen Elizabeth. No taller than 2 feet, this dog was originally bred to herd and drive cattle.
The Hungarian Komondor has long been used to guard livestock. That's because this dog can do so instinctively with no training.
A favorite of Afghan royalty for centuries, the Afghan Hound was bred to hunt gazelle, snow leopards and hare.
Far from an awkward Marmaduke, the Great Dane breed was developed in Germany to hunt wild boar. In fact, this dog was called the "Boar Hound" when introduced to America in the late 1800s.
In ancient Malta, some believed the Maltese dog had healing abilities. They were often brought to the bedsides of the ill in hopes of a speedy recovery.
The Norfolk Terrier was bred specifically for Cambridge University students in the 1800s and 1900s, as they had a great need to rid their dorms of rats.
The Canadian Nova Scotia Duck Tolling, a retriever, was bred to play so beguilingly along a shoreline, as its owner threw a stick or ball, that ducks would leave their hiding places in curiosity. This dog lures ducks in for the hunt.
Known as an ancient companion of Roman warriors, the Neapolitan Mastiff is a guard dog with a twist: Italian owners bred this dog to startle, amaze and astonish onlookers.
Named for an Irish valley, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is a vermin-hunting dog that was bred with a unique talent: This dog functioned as a cog in elaborate turnspits by pawing a large wheel that turns a spit over a fire. Well done!
Although named for the island of Ibiza, the Ibizan Hound was known as a hunting dog in ancient Egypt. They are distinguished by jumping like deer as they chase their prey.
These small, portable and delicate-looking dogs were developed to hunt badgers and other animals that live burrowed underground. In fact, Dachshunds have strong chest muscles, intended for digging up dens.
The centuries-old Norwegian Lundehund breed from arctic Norway has six toes on each foot, in order to climb rocky cliffs so it can hunt puffins.
Originally bred in China as far back as 800 AD, the Pekingese dog has long been a companion of royalty. They earned the moniker "Sleeve Dog" because they were often carried in the sleeves of Chinese courtiers' robes.
It's far easier to call this breed the "Mexican Hairless," but the Xoloitzcuintli (Show-low-itz-quint-lee) was prized by Aztecs as the guard dogs of the dead. They can still be found in Mexican jungles.
These tiny dogs with mysterious origins (people speculate Chihuahuas were developed by Aztecs, ancient Egyptians, the Sudanese or perhaps in Malta) have been used for religious sacrifice, eaten by conquistadors and used to guide their dead owners' souls to the hereafter.
The Bouvier Des Flandres, from the farms of Northern France and Belgium, is traditionally used for herding, pulling milk carts and police work. These dogs often weigh around 100 lbs.
The Newfoundland dog, named for the land where the breed originated, was traditionally used as a working farm dog. Another talent encouraged by the Newfoundland's owners was pulling in fisherman's nets.
The Tibetan Lhasa Apso breed was developed by dalai lamas as guard dogs. These dogs have excellent hearing, which helped their masters protect temples.
An old companion breed from the Mediterranean, Bichon Frises, developed a knack for inspiring painters. They often appear in Renaissance art.

The dogs of Westminster
But, as with any good mystery, it's not that cut and dried.
The profuse bleeding that killed Cruz can be caused by a number of conditions, according to the veterinarian who examined Cruz, Molly Comiskey. After Chaffin rushed the dog to the vet when he threw up blood, Cruz owner Lynnette Blue says, Comiskey listed rat poison as a possible cause.
But because Chaffin and Blue declined a necropsy or further testing, the final answer won't ever be known, Comiskey said in a statement.
Blue says Comiskey told her a necropsy wouldn't have shown anything if the dog had been poisoned days before. The few she's allowed before all turned up inconclusive, she said.
"Also, the thought at the time of him being cut open was too much for me," Blue said.
Westminster dismissed the poisoning suggestion, saying no other dogs fell ill at the show.
"We have never, to our knowledge, had an incident at our show where a dog has become ill or was harmed as a result of being poisoned," the group said in a statement this week.
But the sudden death of an otherwise healthy, closely watched dog seems to point toward poisoning, Chaffin and Blue say.
Chaffin says he watched Cruz closely to make sure he didn't get into anything dangerous. The trip to New York was uneventful. He and Cruz dined on steak from a Manhattan restaurant the night before the show. He scoured their hotel room for no-nos.
And they traveled together to Colorado, where he was appearing in the Rocky Mountain Classic dog show.
The only unusual thing happened during the Westminster show, when a "scowling" woman emerged from the crowd and accused him of being "cruel" and a "horrible person."
The Westminster show has been "plagued by activists" upset with the dog show circuit, Chaffin said. Among other things, people have been upset about a procedure called bark reduction, in which a dog's vocal cords are modified to make it quieter. Cruz had the procedure, Chaffin said.
But he wouldn't go so far as to implicate activists -- or the mysterious, angry stranger -- in Cruz's death.
"I don't know who it was. I think it was done by someone who was sick," he said.
It certainly wasn't us, said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
"It's absolutely outrageous. The people who should be charged with cruelty to animals in this case are the owners for having cut the vocal cords of this poor dog because they didn't want to hear him bark," she said. "And unfortunately, this is not unique to these people. In the really creepy world of dog shows, animals are having their vocal cords cut, their ears cut, their tails are cut off, to make them look a certain way so that their owners can become famous or make money. And it's just sick and it's perverse, and of course it's cruel."
With so much uncertainty, Blue says, the mystery will probably never be solved.
Whatever happened to Cruz, Chaffin and Blue are mourning the loss of the fluffy white dog, who was named best in breed at recent shows in Louisiana and California, and won best in show at contests in Mississippi this year and Louisiana and Texas last year, according to the website doggiestats.com.
"I just can't seem to stop crying and can hardly see," Blue wrote on her Facebook page.

2020 Olympics: Cities vie for Games golden ticket
By Tom McGowan, CNN
updated 5:01 AM EDT, Sat September 7, 2013
The International Olympic Committee is meeting in Buenos Aires to decide whether to award the 2020 Olympic Games to Madrid, Istanbul or Tokyo.
Madrid wants to bring the Olympic Games to Spain for only the second time. The Puerta de Alcala has been chosen as the landmark most associated with the bid. If Madrid gets the green light a party will be held at the historic monument.
The Turkish city of Istanbul offers an unusual blend of cultures as the city sits in both Europe and Asia.
The skyscraper city of Tokyo in Japan held the Olympic Games in 1964 and wants to join the last destination, London, as a multiple host city.
Organizers of Madrid's Olympic bid say the economic crisis in Spain will not affect the country's ability to stage the Games. Madrid is bidding for the third time after failing to win the vote in 2012 and 2016.
The 76,000 capacity Ataturk Olympic stadium will be the centerpiece of Istanbul's Olympic city zone with further zones planned in the forests, on the coast and on the Bosphorus waterfront.
The Tokyo team called up popular Japanese cartoon character Doraemon to act as an ambassador for their Olympic bid.
Madrid has called up arguably its most famous export, the football club Real Madrid, to help its bid. The club's goalkeeper Iker Casillas helped charm an IOC team as part of the bid process.
Asli Cakir won the women's 1,500 meters gold in London, and Turkey will want to nurture more home talent if Istanbul wins the 2020 bid.
Tokyo may believe it can win the right to stage the 2020 Games -- but only the IOC has the power to decide.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo vying for the right to host 2020 Olympic Games
International Olympic Committee to announce the host city on Saturday
Tokyo hosted the Summer Games in 1964
Istanbul and Madrid are bidding to host the event for the first time
(CNN) -- It worked in 2005 with David Beckham, the impassioned pleas of London school children and the promise that an Olympic Games in the British capital would "Inspire a Generation."
It worked -- four years later -- with the prospect of a historic Games in South America when Rio de Janeiro convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of Brazil's suitably to host the world's greatest sporting event.
So on Saturday, what will representatives from Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo come up with to convince IOC members in Buenos Aires that their city should be handed the right to host the 2020 Summer Games?
"Being chosen as a host city is a gold medal," Mike Lee, a veteran of three successful Olympic bid campaigns, told CNN. "Not all cities can host them, not all countries have the economic strength to be able to do it."

Top 3 cities vying for 2020 Olympics
Read: Usain Bolt to retire after Rio
Lee is something of an Olympic king-maker. It began when he was appointed the director of communications and public affairs for London's ultimately successful 2012 bid, before he set up his own strategic communications company Vero in 2006.
Since then, Vero has contributed to the success of Rio de Janeiro's bid to host the 2016 Olympics and Pyeongchang's winning campaign for the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea.
Vero's list of accomplishments also includes advising on Rugby Sevens' election into the 2016 Games and a significant contribution to Qatar's bid to host the 2022 football World Cup.

"We're very proud of our record," Lee said before jetting off to Buenos Aires, where he hopes to see the World Squash Federation -- another Vero client -- successfully lobby for the inclusion of their sport in the 2020 Games.
The radiation level is absolutely safe. The 35 million people living in Tokyo are living in normal conditions. There is no problemTsunekazu Takeda, Japanese Olympic Committee president
"There's a danger with cities that they say they need the Games, but that's not the question.
"The question is why do the Games need your city? What can you bring to the Games, Olympic sport, the Olympic movement? How can you make it different?
Rio's Olympic village is delicious eye candy
"Ultimately that is what we would call a narrative that will allow you to bring your story to life."
Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo will all be desperate for their cities to write the 2020 chapter of the Olympic tale.
Each location will hope to tell its own compelling story.
The Spanish capital of Madrid is proposing a Games on a comparatively modest budget of $2 billion, with the aim of stimulating the economy of a country still wrestling with a financial crisis that has gone on for several years.
Istanbul makes case for 2020 Olympics
Istanbul, with a reported mega-budget of $20 billion, is tantalizingly positioned across two vast markets in Asia and Europe.
And then there is Tokyo's futuristic pitch epitomized by plans for a space-age Olympic Stadium and the promise of a first "downtown Games."
So what factors will woo over 100 voting IOC members?
Istanbul
Slogan: "Bridge Together"
Istanbul would be the first city with a majority Muslim population to host the Games.
"Every bid is different," said Lee. "I think we set a new benchmark in modern campaigning with London 2012.
"The focus was very much on inspiring young people, reconnecting Olympic sport with the next generation. That was a theme with London right from the beginning.
Despite economy, Madrid bids for Olympics
"With Rio it was a focus on a Games of transformation and celebration. Rio was ready, investment in the city would be very significant and also bringing the Games to South America for the first time.
"Pyeongchang, South Korea was the gateway to the Asian market, Asian fans and the next generation of Winter Olympic competitors. South Korea was the platform to do that."
Madrid
Slogan: "Illuminate The Future"
Madrid is running its third successive bid to host the Summer Games.
However, each city's Olympic fairytale must first address concerns over their readiness to stage the Games.
Spain's financial situation remains precarious, while Tokyo's bid team is facing questions and growing concerns over the radiation leak at the Fukushima nuclear plant.
Anti-government protests swept through the streets of Istanbul in June and July, with tear gas and water cannons used by the police to halt demonstrators.
Fukushima casts shadow on Olympic bid
Against the backdrop of political and financial unrest, campaigning for the right to hold a sporting event must strike a delicate balance.
While the rewards and prestige of hosting the Olympics are enormous -- it is safe to say the legacy of staging the Games can breathe new life into a country -- there are plenty of dangers.
"You've got to bid for the event that's right for your city or your country at that time," said Lee.
Tokyo
Slogan: "Discover Tomorrow"
Bidding to host a second Olympics after staging the Games of 1964.
"Cities shouldn't come into a race without understanding the scale of what is involved. Just bidding is an expensive exercise.
"I'm certainly not one who believes more major cities should be bidding for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. They are a massive commitment and a golden prize.
"As London showed, they can be a major boost to a city and to the image and brand of a country. They can make a different to the landscape."
In the final hours before Saturday's vote, Lee urges the bidding cities to hone their narrative to strike the right chord. After all, the chance to stage an Olympic Games arrives just once in a generation.
"You need to be able to show that technically you're good, but also you've got a real edge and story which makes you an attractive option for the IOC," he explained.
"Ultimately, it is clear cities are interested in bidding and we have three strong cities in the 2020 race.
"Already cities are lining up for the 2022 Winter Games and even the 2024 Summer Games. It is clear there is interest across the globe in hosting an Olympic Games."

Wisconsin golf course's $9.11 offer for 9/11 hits a nerve on social media
By David Simpson, CNN
updated 8:22 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2013
A newspaper advertisement for the TumbleDown Trails Golf Course offered nine holes of golf for $9.11 on September 11. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Social media erupts after course offers discount to "commemorate" terror attacks
Offer: $9.11 for nine holes, $19.11 for 18 holes
Management apologizes on Facebook, reports death threats
Course may be closed on Wednesday due to security concerns
(CNN) -- The small, black-and-white newspaper ad offered a discount: Nine holes of golf for $9.11 -- on September 11.
The management of a Wisconsin golf course said the idea was to remember the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, but the ad turned into a public relations disaster on social media.
By Tuesday, TumbleDown Trails Golf Course was reporting death threats.
The golf course in Verona, Wisconsin, placed an advertisement in Monday's Wisconsin State Journal offering to "commemorate" the 12th anniversary of the terror attacks with "9 holes with cart for only $9.11 per person or 18 holes with cart for only $19.11!"
The ad quickly began circulating on social media, and the golf course's Facebook page was flooded with angry comments.
"It's an abomination and a disgrace," one commenter wrote.
"To make an opportunity out of a national tragedy is outrageous," another said.
The management of the course posted an apology on Facebook Tuesday and on a recorded message on the course's main phone line.
"Please accept our sincere apologies," the recording said. "Our attempt to remember the tragedy of that day has been met with negativity and now even death threats. We ask that you please take a moment to reflect and remember those we lost that day, as we were trying to do."
By Tuesday afternoon, many Facebook commenters were defending the course. Some called the ad an honest mistake, and some said outsiders were pumping up the outrage.
"They shouldn't have to apologize for anything! Who are you people to judge," one commenter wrote. "I've played the course before. Nice staff and seem like good people."
Another called the ad "badly worded, ill thought out" but added, "I'm not any more offended than I have been throughout the years every time I see a 9/11 limited edition coin on TV or exploding towers with an eagle crying on a T-shirt or ... the hundreds of others exploiting a tragedy for profit."
A message left on the course's voice mail was not returned Tuesday. Management said in a Facebook post the course may be closed Wednesday because of security concerns.

Photos show scale of North Korea's repressive prison camps -- Amnesty
By Paul Armstrong, CNN
updated 7:09 PM EST, Wed December 4, 2013
A satellite image of a village in the northern part of North Korean political camp 16 (Kwanliso) taken in September 2011.
A year and a half later, in April 2013, the area appears to have undergone change, with new housing being recently added or under construction. The guard post in the immediate vicinity of the village allows for constant supervision of the prisoners and is indicative of the tight security within the political prison camp, says Amnesty International.
In June 2010, an image of the political prison camp known as Kwanliso 16 shows a new facility under construction.
In November 2012, the industrial facility appears to be operational and new support buildings are visible -- a sign of further investment in mining, agriculture and logging production facilities, according to Amnesty.
A satellite image shows a checkpoint on the main road. Amnesty International said these images indicate that repression by the North Korean authorities has continued in spite of growing calls for the country to close its political prison camps.

An image taken in May, 2013 indicates that housing in the area has been razed and reconstructed. Amnesty International said the prisoner population in Kwanliso 16 appears to have increased slightly. Two more housing units under construction close to the main entrance of Kwanliso 16. Each building has ten 4 x 3.5 meter units.
The camp is surrounded by a double fence along its perimeter and numerous guard posts. Access is highly restricted through two gates on opposite sides of the political prison camp.
In March 2011, logging is widely visible in the camp.
An image from September 2013 shows that logging activities have been ongoing over a two year period.

Satellite images of Kwanliso 15 (Yodok Kwanliso), taken on the 26 March 2011 and 22 February 2012 show an administrative compound that was built during that period. The complex is likely to be a guard station or an administrative area to support logging activities.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Amnesty: New images show new activity, including the construction of new housing blocks
The group says up to 200,000 prisoners held in infamous camp system, facing torture, rape
New images show one camp to be three times the size of Washington DC -- Amnesty
Recent United Nations inquiry highlighted "unspeakable" and "widespread" atrocities in camps
(CNN) -- North Korea is showing no signs of scaling back its fearsome labor camp system, with torture, starvation, rape and death a fact of life for tens of thousand of inmates, according to human rights group Amnesty International.
The rights group released satellite images, purportedly showing evidence of expansion, including the construction of new housing blocks and production facilities, at two of the isolated regime's largest camps or "kwanliso" --15 and 16 -- used to hold political prisoners.
"The gruesome reality of North Korea's continued investment in this vast network of repression has been exposed," said Rajiv Narayan, Amnesty International's East Asia Researcher.
"We urge the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those prisoners of conscience held in political prison camps and close the camps immediately."

Amnesty commissioned the images from DigitalGlobe, a commercial satellite imagery vendor. In their release, Amnesty claims that up to 200,000 prisoners, including children, are being held "in horrific conditions in six sprawling political prison camps."
Survivor recounts escape from camp
Pyongyang denies their existence, despite satellite images and testimony from witnesses. Amnesty claims many prisoners are allegedly being held for nothing more than watching foreign soap operas or holding a particular religious belief, while others are incarcerated simply for having a family member deemed politically undesirable.
Camp 16, which is located near Hwaseong in North Hamgyong province, housed an estimated 20,000 people, according to previous analysis by Amnesty in 2011. But the group claims the latest images, taken in May this year, indicate a slight increase in population with the new housing blocks clearly visible. They also appear to show significant economic activity -- including mining, logging and agriculture.
Amnesty said the camp covered an area of around 216 square miles (560 square km), or three times the size of America's capital, Washington DC.
Camp 15, also known as Yodok, is located in the river valleys of central North Korea just 75 miles (120km) from the capital Pyongyang. In 2011, Amnesty reported that around 50,000 people were imprisoned there, though it said 39 housing blocks have since been demolished with only six new blocks built. While Amnesty conceded this might indicate a reduction in prisoner numbers, it said significant industrial activity was visible in the area, including logging.

Amnesty said its analysis of the images pointed to tight security at both sites with perimeter fences and security points clearly marked. "Movement appears to be restricted and controlled through secured entrance gates, guard towers and internal check-points," its report read.

New witnesses
Amnesty also published previously unheard testimony from witnesses in its new report. A former security official, identified only as Mr. Lee, who was at Camp 16 in the 1980s until the mid 1990s described the methods used to execute prisoners in an interview with Amnesty last month. He said detainees were forced to dig their own graves and were then killed with hammer blows to their necks. He also witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and then beating them to death with wooden sticks.
How voice from gulag affected human rights discourse
According to Mr. Lee, women were "disappeared" after being raped: "After a night of 'servicing' the officials, the women had to die because the secret could not get out. This happens at most of the political prison camps."
Kim Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 in the 1980s, described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees caught attempting to escape: "They were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten. The prisoners were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head, chest and feet," she recalled.
In September this year, a United Nations inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea highlighted the "unspeakable" and "widespread" atrocities being carried out in camps that required an international response, including a mother forced to drown her own baby and a prison camp inmate compelled to eat rodents and lizards just to survive.
The rights group says it has shared the latest evidence with the U.N. Commission of Inquiry investigating human rights abuses in North Korea.

The lost art of Mom's retro hairdo
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Ann Hoevel, CNN
updated 2:39 PM EST, Wed December 18, 2013
Betty Hoevel, the author's mother, in 1968 and 1970, achieved these hairstyles with wire brush rollers, gel, teasing and lots of hairspray. Click through the gallery to see more retro hairstyles.
iReporter Janie Lambert from Hughesville, Maryland, says good hair runs in the family. Her aunt was a hair stylist for years and her great aunt worked a beauty shop. She shared this image of her grandmother, right, and great aunt from "the mid '20s or early '30s," she said. "They were inspired by movie stars and celebrities, especially the flapper era, silent movie." A few years later, Lambert's grandmother and great aunt were wearing longer and looser curls, she said. iReporter Kathi Cordsen from Fullerton, California, sent in this photo of her own hair from the 1960s. "Big hair was pretty much the fad in the '60s where I grew up in California. The higher, the better," she said.
Cordsen shot this photo of her sister Judy in the late 1960s. She described her sister as a teenage "lowrider," adding that the car you rode in was just as important as your hair. iReporter Denise Ramirez sent in this photo of herself from 1969, when she was a sophomore at Norwalk High School in Norwalk, California, she said. "Creating this do took a lot of work. The main thing was getting the Aquanet buildup."
iReporter Marie Sager is thankful that her hair today does not require as much effort as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. "Things are easier nowadays, you get a haircut where you just wash and wear," she said. "It automatically gives me an extra hour in the day."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Has your mom's old hairstyle ever amazed you?
It was widely acceptable to only wash your hair once a week in the 1970s
Retro hairstyles are becoming a lost art
(CNN) -- "Omigosh, Mom, look at your hair!"
I was sorting through old family photos with my mother, deciding which to scan for posterity, and there in my hand was her student ID card from Rice University. On it was a small picture of Mom, flashing her familiar grin.
I didn't need the date above her picture to tell me this was from 1970: She was wearing a stripy mockneck shirt that can only be described as, "incredible," with a hairdo that defied both Houston's humidity and her naturally fine, straight hair.
"How on earth did you do that?" I asked her.
Stay in touch!
Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.
She laughed, with some embarrassment, and said that was a bad hair day. We kept digging and found another photo of her this time from 1968. It showed Mom with a perfectly teased, curled-at-the-ends bob so prim and proper she could have gone straight out to a cotillion.
By this time, Mom was laughing hysterically. "What's so funny?" I asked, but she just kept laughing.
It was only when I spoke with John O'Neill of the Empire Education Group, one of the country's oldest cosmetology schools, that I realized I had no chance of understanding why my mom was wrapped in hysterics at the sight of her old photos.
Pin your favorite retro looks from our Retro hair! Pinterest board.
My own arsenal of flat irons, root boosters and Moroccan oil serums could never let me achieve the architectural feats of Mom's old hairdos, he explained.
First off, Mom was working with hair products that had limited capabilities, he said. There was a chemical revolution in hair products during the 1970s and '80s that allowed hairdressers to achieve the kinds of styles that had previously relied on perms, such as the poodle cut, O'Neill said.

While modern products today emphasize shine and natural textures, he said, many hairstyles from the late '60s and early '70s were anything but natural.
In fact, Mom achieved her 'dos with a regimen that sounds like a James Bond torture scene. She started with washed and towel-dried hair. Then she sectioned her hair and slathered it with Dippity-Do.
Whimsically named hair gels were not the only products women used to help style their tresses, said fashion historian and the author of "How to be Adored: A Girl's Guide to Hollywood Glamour" Caroline Cox. Sometimes beer was used for volume and shine, lemon juice for bleaching or lightening hair color -- even eggs were used for a conditioner, she said.
Once her hair was thoroughly gelled, Mom used wire brush rollers to roll her hair into curls. "They were held in place with plastic, pink toothpick-looking things with a tiny knob on one end and a point on the other," she said. O'Neill noted that in order to create some of the still-voluminous but straighter hairstyles of the '70s, women would also roll their hair around beer cans or Coke cans.
Next she donned a bonnet hairdryer, an "inflatable turban with hot air blowing through it," Mom said. Thirty minutes under the dryer was Mom's max, but some women could stay under the dryer for up to an hour, if their hair was long and thick.
"Once your hair was dry, the rollers came out and you brushed it," she said. "Then you teased the hair where you wanted volume and brushed over the teasing to create a shape. I did the bangs by hand."
Next, a finely coiffed lady would practically gas herself with hairspray so the hair never moved again. O'Neill remembers the clouds of hairspray in the salon where his mother got her hair regularly styled into a Marge Simpson-esque beehive in the mid-'60s.
Mom said she washed her hair every other day back then. "In between, I would put my hair in pink foam rollers at night, repeating the process of styling in the morning," she said. "Some people who had more elaborate hair would wrap gobs of toilet paper around their heads and sleep that way."
Then Mom regaled me with legends of people who never combed the teasing out of their hair and just kept spraying it with hair spray -- inadvertently creating the perfect gestation area for "things that would grow on their scalp."
CNN iReporter Denise Ramirez worked the art of teased hair into a weeklong process.
"The main thing was getting the Aquanet buildup," said the native Californian. "I would wash my hair on Sunday, roll it and start the process. By the (next) weekend, it was just the way I wanted it. I ratted it, sprayed it and then combed, then sprayed again."
"My old sister had the same hairdo, so it took us about 30-40 minutes in the bathroom every morning," she said. "This photo has been used on greeting cards and in a commercial in the UK. Crazy that the hairstyle we took for granted back in the day is now something of an oddity."
Dirty hair took the shape of a bubble 'do or bouffant better than clean hair, said Cox. Women would often go to a salon once a week to get their hair washed and set, she said, and that was the only time their hair was washed.
"I can remember my grandma had a perm every six months, had a wash and set once a month and brushed her hair with Vitapointe at home," Cox said. "Attitudes to hair cleanliness were very different."
When O'Neill began his career as a hairdresser in 1976, he said, his main duty was washing clients' hair, which he would have to do three and four times on each person in order to strip off the hairspray and scalp oils.
The advancements in stylists' hair-cutting capabilities and hairstyling products have made it so that modern women can achieve a hairstyle with a lot less effort, he said. But despite all that innovation, if someone went to salon today and asked for my mom's teased-out and curled-up hairdo, he said, she likely couldn't get it.
That's because many older styles aren't taught in cosmetology schools. Rather, "it's up to the older hairdressers to teach the younger hairdressers how to do this," he said. Even when older styles experience a resurgence, like finger waves recently did, the hairdressers O'Neill trained didn't know where to start.
"Most young dressers, under the age of 25, probably don't have a curling iron. They can curl the hair, but they use a flat iron," he said. "There are certain things you can do with a curling iron that you can't do with a flat iron." Thus, the achievement of older hairstyles is becoming an irretrievably lost art.
African-American hairstylists may be best at passing down their knowledge, he said. "If you look at dreads, twists, plaits, braids, all that, they are hundreds and hundreds of years old. And they pass it down through doing their children's hair," he said.
"You probably remember (in the '70s) when the Bo Derek (braid) look became big. At that point in time, if you were in the hair industry, we had to ask the ethnic population to come teach us how to do that," O'Neill said.
With a real understanding of Mom's old hair rituals out of my reach thanks to progress, I wondered, did she ever experience the shock and wonder her unfamiliar hairstyle gave me?
"The exploding bangs you girls had (in the '80s) were really awful," she confessed.
Whatever, Mom. My bangs were Kooshball-perfect.

Cowell: Couple offered 100K to critique sex
Posted By CNN: 1:02 PM ET 11 Comments Hello Anderson, I think you are back in Newyork. Last week programmes were wonderfull. It is very sad that I am going to miss this week several programmes due to my work. Anyway I hope to visit your blog to see new posts. So keep on writing. We like to read them. Bye for now. Take care.

The less air time and exposure given to this man, the better it is.It seems like in every season of "American Idol", some scandal or information surfaces to pique the public interest.My guess is most are manufactured or intentionally released.
Posted By Joseph Kowalski, North Huntingdon, PA : 1:34 PM ET
we'll hope the whole interview with Simon Cowell will be aired because when we watched this episode from 60 minutes it's very short.regards to all staff and crew of AC360 and to Mr. Anderson Cooper.

I saw the interview on "60 minutes". I like Simon,must of the times. I'm like that,in the sense that I say what's on my mind,BUT, lot less rude!!! As for the part where he was offered 100K to critique a couple having sex,sadly,it doesn't surprise me. They have money to waste and/or a sad life.And to think that children are dying from malnutrition. I have a couple of ideas what they could do with their money...I'll be taping the show 'cause I'll be watching the election in my province.Very thight race so it should more exciting than paying Simon to watch me have sex. Could you imagine the comments if he had accepted the offer??"What the bloody hell is that?" or "How to you intend to do something wiht THAT" or "That was gastly".And we could go on and on.....Joanne R.Laval Quebec

I don't watch "American Idol," but I watched the interview on "60 Minutes" and I have heard some of the "winners," so I believe I am qualified to render an opinion about Simon Cowell and what he "does." Let's face it, "American Idol" is nothing more than a glorified "Gong Show" and most of these great "talents" Cowell claims to have discovered amount to little more than canned Muzak singers who interpret other peoples' songs. Cowell is living under the false impression that quantity equals quality. The only quality "American Idol" is providing is to Cowell's quality of life. No one can fairly compare any of this "talent" to the likes of Springsteen, Bono, Sting, and others of that caliber, because these truly talented musicians write their own music and in most cases play an instrument. Granted there are some very talented singers who do not, but they are in a different league than those "interpreters" on "Idol" whose gimmicky voices I find difficult to tolerate. Even Cowell's pride and joy, Il Divo leave a lot to be desired. They may sound "pleasant," but I don't believe they possess the quality of an Andrea Bocelli, Placido Domingo, or even Josh Groban. It's much like comparing Leonardo Da Vinci to Thomas Kinkade. Like many other "pretenders," Cowell is a great merchandiser and he has been able to recruit easily manipulated minds to help him promote his agenda of disrespect and cruelty. My assessment may seem excessive to some, but one only has to turn on the news to see that his glorification of cruelty is having an affect on our society.All I can say about the 100K couple is that they must be highly delusional or enjoy being ridiculed.

I just want to say who gives a crap about Simon Cowell! He is so over blown! Everything he does on AI is just for publicity to get people to watch and talk of the show so he can make more money. And why in the world would someone want him to critique them in bed! He is just so...YUCK!! They must of been absolutely crazy or drugged up.
Posted By Cynthia, Covington, Ga. : 2:41 PM ET
Since when did this guy become so news worthy, I loved last wks shows, I hate to admit it but I'm disappointed in 360 for airing this interview again, wasn't the 1st time enough???
Posted By Kimberly, NYC, NY : 2:52 PM ET
Anderson, I viewed the 60 Minutes contribution you did on this frivolous , overpaid and full of himself "Hollywood phony" As I mentioned to you in a previous blog what this guy gets paid is outright "buffonery" . You'd have to have to be brain dead , void of any brain matter to watch this show, what he gets paid for is pure gluttony. There needs to be a change in hollywood. You interviewed him and nothing he said was even thought provoking, again brain dead matter/material, no offense to you Anderson, you did the best you could as it relates to the subject. great to see you on 60 Minutes" !Maritza
Posted By Maritza Munoz San Jose Ca : 3:00 PM ET
My sound is not working my computer so I can not hear the explanation to this headline, but I feel compelled to say something. I hope that there is a rational explanation for the headline. I will be looking tonight!!I don't know if I truly understand this headline or not, but are you saying that someone actually wanted to pay Simon Cowell, out of all the people in the universe, 100K to critique them having sex just by looking at them -- the same way he critques the singers on American Idol? That is purely the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. If you need a third person to critique your sexual performance just by looking at you, then something is terribly terribly wrong. I have two words for this headline "TOTALLY PITIFUL." Not for Anderson or for the producers of the interview, but for the people who would actually waste that kind of money on their already poor sexual life. I would not even tell anybody if I needed someone else beside my partner to CRITIQUE my sexual performance. That just needs to stay on the super DL!! After the profundity and beauty of last week's shows, it is kind of a let down to go back to the regular old celebrity idolization that we always subjected to when real news runs cold. I like the show American Idol. It is a good show that gives young people a real chance of making it as a singer/performer. I don't think that Simon Cowell is a "master critiquer" though. He knows music, that for sure, but he does not know everything. I just think, like I said before, this is just mere celebrity idolization.Let's get back to the real issues!! I enjoyed last weeks oddysey! It was truly grand. I am glad that Mr. Jeff Corwin is o.k.
Posted By Sylvie Grace, Atlanta, Georgia : 3:15 PM ET
I think that is sick and ridiculous.
Posted By Jess, Paris, KY : 3:29 PM ET
Saw the interview on 60 Minutes - it was great and nice to see another side of Simon!Fans of American Idol should check out the funniest recaps on the web by author Linda Sharp at her Don't Get Me Started blog. She writes about all sorts of other topics as well in between shows - HILARIOUS!http://dontgetmestarted-lindasharp.typepad.com/dont_get_me_started_with_/
