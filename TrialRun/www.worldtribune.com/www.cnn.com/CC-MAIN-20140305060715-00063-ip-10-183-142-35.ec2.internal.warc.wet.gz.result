Passport cases 'imprudent curiosity,' spokesman saysStory Highlights Only a handful of passport file breaches a year, State Department says Passport files of presidential candidates accessed improperly Computer warnings not to access files ignored State Department re-evaluating procedures Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The passport file of any American could be exposed, but there have been only a few breaches of the Passport Office's security system, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Friday. The passport files of Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain were improperly accessed. Those few incidents were likely "imprudent curiosity," he said. "I don't have exact numbers for you, but every single year there's probably a handful of cases where you have unauthorized access to passport data," McCormack told a news briefing. The issue of exposed passport files came to light during the past two days as the State Department revealed the files of the three presidential contenders, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-New York, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, had been accessed without authorization. A State Department source said passport files contain scanned images of passport applications, birth date and basic biographical information, records of passport renewal and possibly citizenship information. McCormack called the incidents "inexplicable" and "over the line." He said whatever the circumstances, those responsible had ample warning to stay out of the files.

"Every single time they access a computer there's a reminder that comes up that says: The information you are about to access has Privacy Act restrictions on it and you are acknowledging that you have a need to know in order to do your job to access this file; and that if you are accessing it in an unauthorized manner, then there are potential penalties." McCormack said the files of politicians and celebrities are flagged for extra attention on unauthorized access, but "the same kind of vigilance applies to every other passport application that we handle." Clinton's file was accessed in a training situation as the passport office handled a "surge" of applications last summer, McCormack said, when a trainee was "encouraged to enter a family member's name, just for training purposes." "This person chose Sen. Clinton's name. It was immediately recognized, they were immediately admonished. And it didn't happen again," he said. The circumstances of the Obama and McCain incidents were under investigation. In each instance, a computer-monitoring system, triggered when employees access the file of a high-profile person, caught the breaches, McCormack said, emphasizing the department's system "worked." He said lower-level managers had thought they had taken care of the problems and did not report them to senior levels in the State Department. Department employees were re-evaluating procedures and working to make sure senior managers are told about breaches, he said. "They are going to take a look at these particular unauthorized accesses ... in the case of these three presidential candidates, but they're also going to take a look at whether or not there are any systemic issues that need to be addressed," McCormack said.

Michael Jackson's death was a homicide, coroner rulesStory Highlights NEW: Lawyer for Jackson physician says report reveals "nothing new" Federal, state agencies launch independent probes into Jackson's death Jackson died from lethal combination of drugs, Los Angeles coroner's office says The legendary pop singer was found dead on June 25 Next Article in Entertainment » Read VIDEOTIMELINE By Alan Duke CNN LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County coroner has ruled that Michael Jackson's death was a homicide involving a combination of drugs. Michael Jackson was found dead on June 25. He had been preparing for a comeback concert series in London. "The drugs propofol and lorazepam were found to be the primary drugs responsible for Mr. Jackson's death," said a news release issued Friday by the coroner. "Other drugs detected were: midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine and ephedrine." The release said Jackson died from "acute propofol intoxication," but said "other conditions contributing to death: benzodiazepine effect." Lorazepam, midazolam and diazepam are benzodiazepines. A lawyer for Jackson's personal physician criticized the coroner for releasing only a brief summary of his findings, saying it contained "nothing new" and had "all the earmarks of police gamesmanship." Michael Jackson's family issued a statement in reaction: "The Jackson family again wishes to commend the actions of the Coroner, the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies, and looks forward to the day that justice can be served." Federal and state agencies also have launched independent investigations into "matters uncovered" by Los Angeles police while looking into Jackson's death, authorities said. Watch a report on the coroner's findings » The Los Angeles Police Department, which has been conducting a criminal investigation of Jackson's death, requested at an interagency meeting last week that federal and state agencies pursue their own investigations, according to statements issued Friday by California's attorney general and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The full and final autopsy report and the complete toxicology report "will remain on security hold at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County district attorney," the release said.

Sleepless night preceded Jackson's death
In Depth: Michael Jackson
Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician, told investigators that he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs -- lorazepam, midazolam and diazepam -- in an effort to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing, according to a police affidavit made public earlier this week. Murray also told detectives he administered a dosage of the anesthetic propofol, diluted with lidocaine, to Jackson a short time before he stopped breathing, the affidavit said. The 32-page sworn statement was written by Los Angeles Police detective Orlando Martinez to outline probable cause for warrants to search Murray's offices, home and storage rooms in Texas and Nevada. Murray told detectives he had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks, giving him 50 milligrams of propofol, the generic name for Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip, the affidavit said. Worried that Jackson might become addicted to the drug, Murray said he tried to wean Jackson from it, putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping him sleep during the two nights before his death. But on the morning of June 25 other drugs failed to do the job. Murray recounted the events to detectives in an hour-by-hour account that was detailed by Martinez: • About 1:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson 10 mg of Valium (diazepam). • About 2 a.m., he injected Jackson with 2 mg of the antianxiety drug Ativan (lorazepam). • About 3 a.m., Murray then administered 2 mg of the sedative Versed (midazolam). • About 5 a.m., he administered another 2 mg of Ativan. • About 7:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson yet another 2 mg of Versed while monitoring him with a device that measures the oxygen saturation of his blood. • About 10:40 a.m., "after repeated demands/requests from Jackson," Murray administered 25 mg of propofol, the document said. "Jackson finally went to sleep and Murray stated that he remained monitoring him. After approximately 10 minutes, Murray stated he left Jackson's side to go to the restroom and relieve himself. Murray stated he was out of the room for about two minutes maximum. Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing." Efforts at CPR proved fruitless. Jackson was pronounced dead at UCLA Medical Center at 2:26 p.m. Earlier this week, Murray's lawyer disputed the final section of the timeline. "Dr. Murray simply never told investigators that he found Michael Jackson at 11 a.m. not breathing," Chernoff said. "He also never said that he waited a mere 10 minutes before leaving to make several phone calls. In fact, Dr. Murray never said that he left Michael Jackson's room to make phone calls at all." In Friday, Chernoff criticized the coroner's office for making the "contains nothing new." "For two months we have been hearing the same information, usually from leaks out of the coroner's office," Chernoff said. "One has to wonder why the coroner felt compelled to release anything at all if the police investigation is not yet complete." Agents from the California attorney general's office also will investigate physicians whose names have come up in the course of the Jackson death probe, Attorney General Jerry Brown said. The federal drug administration also responded with its own independent investigations "into matters that the LAPD's investigation uncovered that may not be directly related to the cause of death," the agency said. Last week Drug Enforcement agents executed a federal administrative search warrant at the Mickey Fine Pharmacy in Beverly Hills, California, looking for prescription records relating to Jackson, an agency spokesman said. The pharmacy sits directly below the offices of Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein. Shortly before his death, Jackson visited the building several times to see Klein. Klein, who treated Jackson for decades, denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. Attorney General Brown said that agents with his Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement "will review relevant records and documents." The attorney general's office maintains a computerized prescription drug monitoring system that tracks controlled substances.

FAA administrator on leave after Virginia DWI charge
From Mike Ahlers, CNN
updated 2:45 PM EST, Mon December 5, 2011
Police arrested Randy Babbitt, 65, Saturday, for allegedly driving while intoxicated. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt requests a leave of absence
Officials are "in discussions" about the FAA chief's employment status
Babbitt is accused of driving while intoxicated in Fairfax, Virginia
Police say Babbitt was released after a magistrate issued a warrant
Washington (CNN) -- The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will take a leave of absence after his arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated, officials said Monday.
Police in Fairfax, Virginia, arrested Randy Babbitt, 65, Saturday night after spotting the car he was allegedly driving traveling on the wrong side of the road, the department said in a news release.
Babbitt, who was alone in the car, cooperated with the arrest and was released on his own recognizance after a magistrate issued a warrant, according to Fairfax police.
Officials of the Department of Transportation, which includes the FAA, learned of the arrest on Monday and were "in discussions with legal counsel about Administrator Babbitt's employment status," the department said in a statement.
"Administrator Babbitt has requested, effective immediately, to take a leave of absence from the FAA. That request has been granted," the statement said.
Sasha Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation, declined comment. The FAA had no immediate comment.
White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama learned of the arrest Monday afternoon along with the rest of the administration. He declined to say if the president will ask for Babbitt's resignation.
Babbitt is a veteran pilot who flew for Eastern Airlines for 25 years, according to his official FAA biography. He became the agency's administrator in 2009.
Deputy Administrator Michael Huerta will serve as the agency's acting administrator, the Department of Transportation said.
A veteran transportation official and former managing director of the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Huerta was confirmed to his post as the FAA's deputy administrator in June 2010.

It's settled! Creator tells us how to pronounce 'GIF'
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 5:11 PM EDT, Wed May 22, 2013 | Filed under: Web
Steve Wilhite, left, received a Webby Award from Tumblr's David Karp for his invention of the animated GIF format.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
GIF creator: It's pronounced "JIF"
Steve Wilhite created the Graphics Interchange Format in 1987 at Compuserve
He pronounced the issue closed at the Webby Awards
And yet, some partisans remain unswayed
(CNN) -- We can't settle iPhone vs. Android or "Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek" for you. But another long-running geek debate was put to rest Tuesday night.
Those short, animated loops that have captivated the Web for decades? They're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter.
Steve Wilhite created the Graphics Interchange Format, or GIF, while working for Compuserve in 1987. On Tuesday, he received a Webby Award for it and delivered his five-word acceptance speech (that's all the Webbys allow) by flashing a GIF on the big screens at the Cipriani Wall Street in New York.
And, in a flash, it all became clear:
"It's pronounced JIF, not GIF."
Of course, in the grand tradition of heated debate, a flat statement of fact by the creator wasn't enough to sway some partisans. On Twitter, "GIF" became a trending topic as some folks pushed back.
"Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics. Not Jraphics. #GIF #hardg," wrote Web designer Dan Cederholm.
"So instead of GIF, we've got to say JIF? YEAH RIGHT," chimed in October Jones, creator of the "Texts From Dog" Tumblr and book. "And I suppose those animals with long necks are called 'JIRAFFES.'"
And, of course, the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way. The always amusing HAL 9000 account (yes, somebody tweets as the robot from "2001") posted an "animated JIF" -- which is to say, a swirling, animated jar of the tasty, high-protein spread.
So, it's perhaps no surprise that the company got into the act itself. Wednesday afternoon, the company took to Twitter with a post reading, "It's pronounced Jif® ." The tweet linked to, what else, a multi-colored GIF flashing the same phrase.
Animated GIFs were a staple of the early Internet. Remember The Dancing Baby? That's a GIF.
They fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged. But in the past couple of years, the Web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again.
Appropriately, Wilhite received his Lifetime Achievement Award from David Karp, the founder of Tumblr, one prominent place where GIFs found a new fanbase.
In less publicized interviews, Wilhite had argued for the soft-G pronunciation for years. So, will a widely covered "speech" in front of some of the Web's most influential folks finally be the turning point?
Maybe not.
Last month, no less an authority than the White House posted an image on its new Tumblr feed advocating for the hard-G. And the Oxford English Dictionary says both pronunciations are acceptable.
So, here's wishing Mr. Wilhite "Jood Luck."

Animal DNA and Mars kits: Christmas gifts of the future?
By Sheena McKenzie, for CNN updated 8:11 AM EST, Wed December 11, 2013
Step inside the "99¢ Store of the Future," a pop-up installation in downtown Brooklyn offering your standard products -- alongside some items from a very different world...
The surreal project, from designers the "Extrapolation Factory," involved selling bespoke products from the future in an ordinary 99¢ Store.
The designers used a combination of expert forecasts and crowd sourcing to create their products, ranging anywhere from 10 to 10,000 years in the future. As this label says: "The successful woman who put her career first now has a family thanks to advancements in fertility technologies. Tripple Nipple Baby Bottle allows moms to feed more than two mouths at once."
The designers asked members of the public to read expert predictions for the future, and then come up with their own stories for products, such as this Space Suit Lining Replacement Kit: "It's been at least three years since I last went in to space. I checked the old space suit and transgenic moths had eaten all of the lining in the helmet." The Currency Converter emerged from two think tanks reports -- one predicting a world shortage of cocoa, and the other pointing to a rise in new currencies. "On the street, it's hard to tell if that currency is truly valuable, be it cocoa, or weight reduction surgery coin. This converter can help you accept only the most authentic currency."
"Myotragus balearicus -- also known as the Balearic Islands Cave Goat -- became extinct around 5,000 years ago. A hair follicle from the chin of the Myotragus Balearicus entombed within Cryogel® enables reanimation in the future."
"Instead of painkillers, it's ecstasy or LSD prescriptions that people are using and abusing. Instead of just association, they're seeking connection. The cheap bio availabilities to create new life-forms enables everybody to create their own pet to trip with."
"We had an older woman come in, her son is a doctor, and she gravitated to the home transplant kit," said Extrapolation Factory designer Elliott Montgomery. "We asked her why and she said: 'I'm not sure what the future will be like, but I bought this for my son because I want him to think about this. I want him to ponder what it would be like if we had this kind of technology.'"
This product was influence by a Institute for the Future forecast which said: "By 2021, for the first time in human history, thousands of languages will go digital, changing the economics, politics, and culture of global exchange."
"Void Refill can be used to refresh the hollow present. Regeneration of emptiness is a gradual process. When used regularly this high quality all-natural material helps keep concepts ephemeral." Step 1: Soak area to be treated for two minutes in a pan of warm water with gentle liquid beauty soap. Step 2: Dip the refill in the soapy water. Step 3: Close your eyes."
To create the fantastical objects, 40 participants read future forecasts, and then came up with befitting scenarios. They were asked to think about five aspects -- ecological, technological, social, political, and economic (pictured on the workshop wall).
They were then given materials from other 99¢ stores, and asked to create products for these strange future worlds. Here, two shoppers check out the space-age products hidden in an ordinary store. "We're interested in crowd-sourcing futures, as opposed to presenting ourselves as these 'futurists' sitting in a white box, twiddling our thumbs and imaging the future," said Montgomery. "We almost consider ourselves service providers for helping others to think about the future."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
What would 99¢ store of the future look like? Two NY designers found out
Created hundreds of futuristic products, and sold them in ordinary shop
Now surreal items have gone on show in Shanghai Design 2013 exhibition
(CNN) -- All I want for Christmas is a triple-nipple baby bottle, some extinct goat DNA, and a Mars survival kit. Is that really too much to ask?
Not if you happened to walk past a particular neon-lit convenience store in downtown Brooklyn -- the flashing sign in the window advertising "Cash for genes."
Inside the unremarkable 99¢ shop you'd find the usual assortment of hair accessories, shoelaces, and cleaning products; the only thing binding them together being their "Low! Low!" price.
But take a closer look and you'd also discover strange items from the future -- a universal language translator, a liquid cash injection kit, even some spacesuit lining (for when those bothersome transgenic moths eat through your helmet).
The dress that turns transparent when the wearer is aroused. Would you try it? Dutch design collective Studio Roosegaarde have developed a sensual dress called Intimacy 2.0 together with designer Anouk Wipprecht. Made of leather and smart e-foils, it 'explores the relationship between technology and intimacy'. The high-tech panels are stimulated by the heartbeat of the wearer. Initially opaque or white, they become increasingly transparent when exposed to an electric current -- in this case a beating heart. We might shout less at one another in the future, as it looks like we'll be wearing our hearts on our sleeves. Another garment that displays your emotions to the world is the GER Mood Sweater, by design lab Sensoree. Based on the technology of a classic lie detector test, it interprets emotions and displays mood instantly as an interactive light display. Blue means relaxed and red is nervous or angry. Rather than bringing dirt into your house, these shoes will clean it up. Looking like something out of Star Wars, the FOKI vacuum shoes are a concept from Indonesian product designer Adika Titut Triyugo. They are equipped with a pair of rotary cleaners on the sole of each shoe and a LED display on top that indicates battery life and cleaning progress. So be a trooper and go vacuum.
It's a love/hate thing. The cycling helmet can save your life, but it doesn't look good and tends to ruin your hair. Thankfully the future offers a solution -- the Hövding. A Swedish creation, the Hövding is an "airbag for cyclists". It's worn as a collar and only expands into a full helmet if you have an accident. The future is all about leading a stress-free life and having all the solutions for all problems at hand. Literally. For example, if you wear Lark Pro's vibrating alarm bracelet, you can slip out of bed quietly without waking your partner. It's also designed to help insomniacs improve their sleeping patterns, by picking the optimal time in a sleep cycle to wake a user up.
Don't like strangers approaching you? Then the Smoke Dress is a must-have. Designed by Anouk Wipprecht, the dress can suddenly visually obliterate itself through the emission of a cloud of smoke. Ambient clouds of smoke are created when the dress detects a visitor approaching, thus camouflaging itself within it's own materiality. Perfect if you are a fashionable socialite AND a misanthrope. The future will be bright in all those augmented realities. Google Glass is the wearable computer that responds to voice commands and displays information on a visual display.
Tired of waiting forever at a bar before you finally get your mojito? Tired of over-crowded bars even? Soon, your best cocktail dress will also make the cocktails. The DareDroid dress uses medical technology, customized hardware and mood analysis to provide you with your favorite poison. Designed by Anouk Wipprecht.
Technology opens up new playful ways for people to interact. SENSOREE's Heart Sync is a heart synchronizing game to find out when our hearts beat as one. The players wear corsets that display their heart rate. When close to one other, each player's hood senses the other's pulse and synchronizes to it. When two Heart Sync player's hearts have completely synchronized, the hoods swirl white and the game is won.
The field of wearable technology is rich with exploration of human emotion -- and headwear that would turn Padmé Amidala green with envy. The flirty Blinklifier is a concept by Tricia Flanagan and Katia Vega. It's fitted with LEDs that respond to specific eye-movement and could take flirting to a new level. Researchers hope the result will give people more visual clues about how their friends are feeling. One ring to rule them all! Use the NFC Ring, a UK-based Kickstarter project created by John McLear, to unlock doors, share pictures, share social network links, unlock phones and much more. Just fist-bump your phone or tablet or use an open-palm gesture to transfer the information. And it never needs charging. Booya! Shine bright like a diamond ... or be the star at futuristic rave parties. The GalaxyDress by CuteCircuit is embroidered with 24,000 full color LEDs, and is believed to be the largest wearable display in the world. The LEDs are extra-thin, flexible and hand embroidered on a layer of silk. Fabulous darling!
Doing exercise without monitoring yourself be rare in the future of wearable technology. And wearing a giant watch that counts your steps is so 2012. That's where the Misfit Shine necklace comes in. It's a physical activity tracker that you can hang around your neck, or put wherever your want. The Shine's 12 dots represent your daily activity goal.
Glow in the dark with the LumiDress. Made up of ultra-thin optical fibers woven together with other synthetic fiber this dress will light up the night. This concept dress called Bubelle by Philip's Design interacts with and predicts the wearer's emotional state by changing colors. A beautiful white can turn into a relaxed blue. Philip's dresses are made from high-tech materials and are still in the concept phase. Skip the perfume and let your body do the ... scenting. The Smart Second Skin Dress by Jenny Tillotson is a research project aimed at creating scents for every occasion. The dress allows a user to breathe the scent of his or her choice. It can be to energize, to boost confidence or simply to smell nice. If flexing your muscles doesn't impress the object of your affection, then it will at least impress your shirt. Radiate Athletics' new shirt lets you visually track each individual muscle's progress in real time and make adjustments to your workout on the fly. Color changes track the progress of your work out, allowing your mirror to become the only personal trainer you need. In the future, your dress might advise you to skips that romantic walk through the fields. It might tell you that the area's greenhouse gas levels are too high. Danish design company Diffus has created the Climate Dress. It's laced with hundreds of small LEDs that will respond to greenhouse gases. They will pulse slowly when the levels are normal and flash rapidly in highly polluted areas.
Thanks to all those gadgets you can attach to your body, there will soon be no excuse not to exercise. And to avoid injuries in the future where everyone will jog to work, Sensoria Socks by Heapsylon have come up with sensor-equipped textile that couples with an activity tracker to identify injury-prone running styles. Then, using a simple app, it coaches the runner to reduce those tendencies.

Wearable technology
Balmond's 'non-linear' approach to design
This is the world according to the Extrapolation Factory -- a group of New York designers using a mixture of expert reports and crowd-sourcing to create products anywhere from 10 to 10,000 years in the future.
How a thin piece of paper can save lives
Made in Brooklyn
Now items from their "99c Store of the Future" -- a one-off installation where space-age objects were sold in an ordinary shop -- has gone on display in China's first state-run contemporary art gallery.
The Shanghai Power Station of Art -- a former power station turned museum overlooking Huangpu River -- last week launched its Design Shanghai 2013 exhibition, showcasing over 500 works from around the world.
"We're contributing 30 products that came from the 99¢ store -- very peculiar, bespoke future objects," said Elliott Montgomery, co-founder of the Extrapolation Factory.
"By putting these ideas out there, we're pushing the way people think about consumerism far beyond the immediate. It'll be interesting to see how people's reactions in Shanghai differ from those in New York City."

Futuring The surreal project is part of a growing movement in design called "Futuring" -- which as the name suggests, involves creating products for the future.
"The incorporation of futures thinking into the design world has picked up pace hugely since the mid-2000s," said Stuart Candy, professor of foresight and design at Ontario College of Art and Design.
"With massive global challenges looming, like climate change, peak oil, and economic volatility, we need to develop a cultural capacity for thinking ahead and creating options -- so we aren't just reacting to crisis after crisis."
But "Futuring" isn't just about developing environmentally-friendly cars or search-and-rescue robots. As the Extrapolation Factory showed, it can also be found in the ordinary 99¢ store down the road, or what Candy describes as "Guerrilla Futuring."
"The 99¢ store project is interesting because it's a rare invitation to imagine the future's mundane side," he added.
"Popular notions of the future often get stuck in a kind of glossy rut - gleaming buildings and whiz-bang inventions -- and it's not often that we see the futures of everyday life brought into focus."
Design So how did the Extrapolation Factory create their intriguing objects?
The group -- comprising 33-year-olds Elliott Montgomery and Chris Woebken, who met after studying design interactions at London's Royal College of Art -- put the call out for members of the public interested in "futuring."
On a snowy day in New York City, they gathered 40 people -- ranging from seven-year-old kids to middle aged architects -- and asked them to read think-tank reports on the future.
"The forecasts were from a broad spectrum -- obesity as a percentage of the UK population, robots in the homes of South Koreans, shortages of chocolate, acceptance of drug use, and technology," said Montgomery.
Read: The psychology of curvy architecture The participants then wrote a short story imagining a world where these forecasts came to life. A table was laid out with various items from other 99¢ stores, which they used to create new products for their fantastical fables.
"We got some very bleak futures where environmental scenarios were really devastating, like the dying out of coral reefs. So products like the "Grow Your Own Coral Reef" responded to those issues," said Montgomery.
We're pushing the way people think about consumerism far beyond the immediateElliott Montgomery, co-founder of the Extrapolation Factory
"At the same time there were people who imaged a future of great possibilities. One of the children was responding to the idea of robots in all our homes, who would help her brush her pet chinchilla. So the product she made was an arm attachment for your chinchilla-brushing robot."
What next?
There's an interesting parallel in seeing objects from the 99¢ store of the future going on display in China -- one of the world's biggest makers of cheap, mass-produced products.
Read: Could good design help feed the world?
"It seems appropriate that the project be brought from New York to Shanghai," said Candy. "It prompts us to think about the supply chains - in which China is a critical link - which make the phenomenon of 99¢ stores possible in the developed world."
So could these fantastical 99¢ items become reality?
"We're not asking people to predict, but more to dream," said Montgomery. "Or produce nightmares, if that's what will help us make decisions in the present."
