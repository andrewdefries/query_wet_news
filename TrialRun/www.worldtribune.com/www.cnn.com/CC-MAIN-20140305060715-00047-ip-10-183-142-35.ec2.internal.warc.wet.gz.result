NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) - In Consumer Reports' most recent survey of vehicle reliability, the top of the list is, once again, dominated by Japanese manufacturers.
Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand, is ranked as the most reliable nameplate, followed by Honda and Toyota's Toyota brand. Of the top ten brands ranked by predicted reliability, according to Consumer Reports, nine are Japanese.
Only one U.S.-based brand, Ford Motor Co.'s Mercury, made the top 10. Mercury ranked eighth. In last year's survey, Mercury had ranked 16th.
Not all Japanese manufacturers did so well, however. Infiniti, Nissan's luxury division, dropped from eighth place last year down to 28th place in Consumer Reports' reliability rankings this year. The Infiniti QX45 was the most unreliable vehicle among all new cars.
Among overall brands, Porsche ranked as the least reliable based entirely on problems with the Cayenne SUV.
Consumer Reports' reliability predictions are based on an annual survey the magazine conducts of subscribers to its magazine and Web site, ConsumerReports.org. This year, Consumer Reports said, the magazine collected survey data on more than one million vehicles. Each survey respondent can supply data on one or two vehicles.
The survey asks owners to report major problems -- meaning problems that cost a significant amount to repair or that took the vehicle out of service or caused a safety risk -- within the past 12 months. The survey covered 1998 to 2005 model-year vehicles.
In recent surveys, reliability has not been improving as quickly as it had in the past, Consumer Reports said. While Japanese brands still do best and U.S. brands are improving, all have seen the rate of problems per 100 vehicles stay relatively flat since 2003.
Reliability: Top-ten ranked brands

2. Honda
3. Toyota

Losing weight: Where do I begin?Asked by Marta, El Paso, Texas Hello! I am 26 years of age. I weigh approximately 300 pounds and I am 5 feet 2 inches tall. I have thought about weight loss surgery, but I don't feel as though that is the correct way for me to go. I am scared of it. I suffer from asthma, Meniere's disease, kidney stones, high cholesterol, allergies and depression. My question to you is, what is a good starting point to help me lose weight. I have to be careful because of the asthma and such. It's all so overwhelming that I literally lose ambition because I'm not sure where to start. I am already on a diet because of the cholesterol, and my dad is diabetic so we all support him in his diet. I didn't put the weight on overnight, and I don't expect to lose it that way. I just want a starting point to help out. Diet and Fitness Expert
Dr. Melina Jampolis

Expert answer Hi Marta. I commend you for your desire to try and tackle your weight problem without resorting to surgery. You have a long journey ahead of you, but you seem to have a good attitude, and I'm happy to hear that you don't expect to lose the weight overnight. I get very concerned that some of the weight loss television programs cause people to have unrealistic weight loss goals. And with all the diet information out there, I'm not surprised that you are overwhelmed. Here are a few tips and comments to get you started. 1. Keep a food journal -- I refuse to see patients if they do not keep a food journal. It really helps not only keep you aware of what you are eating, it can also help you figure out the best way to eat specifically for you. If you find through your journal that you get super hungry after eating a certain food or at a certain time of day, you might want to plan a different type of food or perhaps schedule a mini meal instead of just a snack. Keeping a journal can also help you trouble shoot if the scale is refusing to budge. Review your journal carefully and see if there are any extra calories that may be sneaking into your diet. Oils, dressings, cheese, toppings and sauces are common culprits. 2. Get a pedometer -- A pedometer, or step counter, is a handy little device that you can strap to your waistband or even your purse. Many experts recommend aiming for 10,000 steps per day, but I would start by seeing how many steps you take in an average day and try to increase by 500 steps per week until you hit 10,000. Asthma should not be a barrier to exercising regularly. If you get symptomatic during exercise, talk to your doctor about changing your medication regimen. Many professional athletes including football players, Olympic track athletes and pro basketball players have asthma, so don't let that stand in the way of exercising. If the Meniere's disease makes walking long distances difficult, you may want to try a stationary bike. You can probably get a fairly inexpensive one at your local sporting goods store or buy a used one on Craigslist. 3. Talk with your doctor about your medications -- Some medications, including some antidepressants, can cause weight gain, so it is important to review your medication list with your doctor to make sure that no medications are interfering with your weight-loss efforts. Your doctor may even be able to prescribe an antidepressant that can help slightly with weight loss. 4. Plan ahead -- It may help to sit down Sunday night and try to plan your meals (approximately -- I know things come up) for the week. This can help keep you on track and ensure that you have healthy eating options wherever you go and whenever you need them. I always carry a protein bar, apple, small bag of almonds and a bottle of water to keep me out of trouble if I'm running around or traveling. If you are eating out, try to think about healthy eating options ahead of time, and if you are going to a restaurant that has delicious bread or tortilla chips, have a small snack (turkey slices or veggies and hummus) before you leave so you aren't famished when you get there and devour the bread basket. Having a plan can go a long way toward keeping you on track. 5. Don't have an all-or-nothing mentality -- If you get off track or make a bad eating choice, don't let that ruin your entire day/weekend/week. Just resolve to make better choices right away and don't beat yourself up. Many people feel so badly about making poor choices, they end up just giving up and really doing a lot of damage. One ice cream cone is not going to ruin your diet, but a weekend of pizza, nachos and ice cream can do a lot of damage. Leave Your Answer

Ten Questions: April 1
In Depth: G-20: Rebuilding the global economy
Bill to OK travel to Cuba to be unveiled How will the April Fools' computer worm affect you?
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Kicking off a new month, new day and new edition of CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: G-20 Summit AZUZ: A gathering of representatives from 20 of the world's leading economic powers is what's first up today. This group is called the G-20, and it was established 10 years ago to address key issues in the global economy. Member nations come from around the world, from Argentina and Brazil in South America, to India and China in Asia, the entire European Union, and of course the U.S., the world's largest economy. At this week's G-20 meeting in London, the worldwide financial crisis looks to dominate the discussion. Charles Hodson gives us a preview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Downloadable Maps
London, England
Cuba
CHARLES HODSON, CNN ANCHOR: The last big summit was just four months ago, but did the Washington G-20 meeting really help? And will this week's London extravangaza speed recovery? There will be some visible differences at the gathering. Big difference number one: this man's no longer U.S. president. FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: It would be a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of success. HODSON: Now, Barack Obama carries the hopes of America, and on his first big trip overseas, the world's hopes, too. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It will take many months and many different solutions to lead us out. There are no quick fixes and there are no silver bullets. HODSON: Back in November, his election provided brief respite from the stomach-churning drama of Wall Street's biggest names collapsing, global stock prices sliding, and economies crumbling. The G-20 offered unity rather than specifics. NICOLAS SARKOZY, FRENCH PRESIDENT: We all agreed in the necessity of the revival of coordinated and concerted economic action by all countries. HODSON: The world has since drunk deep of the bitter cocktail of recession: unemployment, poverty and hopelessness. With workers losing their jobs everywhere, G-20 governments have four main weapons in their armories. First, fiscal stimulus: in the U.S. case, $787 billion worth; the European Union, $546 billion; and China, $585 billion. Then, cutting interest rates and anything that pushes money through a choked-up financial system, direct intervention in troubled sectors like banking and carmaking, and tighter regulation so banks will not overreach again. There'll likely be a statement with many action points as in November, but ultimately, each nation will decide which it'll implement and which it'll simply ignore. Beyond that, if they have a good talk, cry on each other's shoulders and avoid a quarrel, it'll be a good outcome. So, will it make a difference? When it comes to recovering economies, nobody can honestly say which measures do the trick. After all, economists are still debating exactly what brought on the Great Depression 80 years ago, or what got the world out of it. Charles Hodson, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP) I.D. Me! ERIK NIVISON, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an island nation that was discovered by Christopher Columbus. I was under Spanish rule until 1898. Following a revolution in 1959, I've had a tense relationship with the U.S. I'm Cuba, and I'm located less than 100 miles away from Florida! Cuba Travel Ban AZUZ: Part of that tense relationship between Cuba and the U.S. includes an American embargo, or restriction, on trade with the island nation, and most Americans aren't legally allowed to travel there. That ban has been in place for nearly 50 years following Cuba's communist revolution. But as Jim Acosta reports, a group of U.S. Senators are proposing a bill to end it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM ACOSTA, CNN REPORTER: Tessie Aral, the owner of this Miami travel agency that specializes in trips to Cuba, is in a good mood these days. Ever since Washington loosened the travel restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting the island, Aral says non-Cuban-Americans have been calling in wondering when they can join the party. TESSIE ARAL, ABC CHARTERS: I think most Americans are going to want to try to travel to Cuba because it's been the forbidden fruit for so long. SEN. BYRON DORGAN, (D) NORTH DAKOTA: We allow Americans to travel to China, to Vietnam; both communist countries. ACOSTA: North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan wants to do the same for Cuba, with a bill in Congress that would end all travel restrictions -- yes, all of them -- for Americans visiting the communist nation, arguing the Cold War-era policy aimed at the Castro government has failed. DORGAN: Seems to me, if something has failed for nearly five decades, you might want to take a look at it again and see whether you should modify it. ACOSTA: Dan Erikson, the author of the book "The Cuba Wars," says there's one problem with lifting the ban: the embargo which stops U.S. companies from doing business in Cuba. DAN ERICKSON, AUTHOR, "THE CUBA WARS": So, you have American tourists traveling on to Cuba to drive around on Chinese buses, stay in Spanish hotels, eat Canadian food. ACOSTA: They wouldn't be able to stay at a Marriott, at a Hilton. They wouldn't be able to use their Delta Sky Miles. ERICKSON: There's no Hilton. There's no miles. The only drive-thru McDonald's I've ever seen in Cuba was at the military base at Guantanamo Bay. ACOSTA: President Obama has hinted at changes in U.S. policy on Cuba, but never mentioned how much. On a trip to Chile, Vice President Joe Biden indicated support for the embargo, but added: U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We thought there was a need for a transition in our policy toward Cuba. ACOSTA: That transition would have to get past Cuban-Americans in Congress, like Senate Democrat Bob Menendez. SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, (D) NEW JERSEY: The government is, pure and simple, a brutal dictatorship. The average Cuban worker lives on an income of less than a dollar a day. ACOSTA: Travel agent Tessie Aral is one of a growing number of Cuban-Americans who say it's time to move on. ARAL: For our country to tell us we're not free to choose where we want to travel to, I think that's just archaic. (END VIDEO CLIP) April Fools' Virus? AZUZ: Okay, switching gears. Today is April 1st, a day designed for pranks, and researchers hope that's all Conficker.c is. Analysts say this thing is a computer worm, one that's infected millions of machines and that is set to launch today. This could end up like the Y2K bug: hype about the year 2000 computer changeover that didn't really amount to much. But as Errol Barnett explains, security experts are taking this threat very seriously. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERROL BARNETT, CNN REPORTER: Right now, the Conficker worm is moving through servers like these around the world. It has the best anti-worm researchers scrambling to figure out what to do, and the clock is ticking. It first surfaced last October, targeting computers using Microsoft's Windows software. Since then, it spread, evolved and become such a threat Microsoft is offering $250,000 to anyone who can stop it. Analysts say it's programmed to become active on April 1, and according to their research, here's how Conficker works: First the worm, which is a complex computer program, is created and sent out through the Internet. Landing in servers, it then searches for computers on the network to hack into. It preys on computers with weak network passwords, old anti-virus softare or Windows software not recently updated. But once inside, it creates a so-called "zombie computer" that could be controlled by the worm's designer. One person who's been following this worm since it was created is Rik Ferguson. He's the senior security advisor at Trend Micro. He joins me now via webcam from England. Rik, once this worm gets into your computer, what can it do? RIK FERGUSON, SENIOR SECURITY ADVISER, TRENDMICRO.COM: Well, in terms of what it's going to do on April the 1st, it's really anybody's guess. The worst case is that the outside estimates of the numbers of infected machines are true, and that's multiple millions. We could, for example, drown under a deluge of spam. We could have, alongside that spam, a vast number of previously unknown machines that are now infected, hosting malicious software which will create a vicious circle of more people getting infected. BARNETT: Now, this is specifically targeting Microsoft users. Microsoft is telling its users to head to http://search.live.com. I have that pulled up here, where it says you can get a free PC safety scan. But if my computer's infected, I might have a problem getting to this site, correct? FERGUSON: That's right. One of the things that the latest variant of this worm does is it blocks access to a large number of security-related and clean-up related Web sites, one of those being http://safety.live.com. BARNETT: And being that it comes out April 1st, any possibility that this is some sort of hacker's hoax? FERGUSON: No. The people behind this software are very skilled programmers and they're very well informed. We've seen them incorporate updates using the latest encryption technology, literally as it was released, within this worm. These are very skilled cyber-criminals. BARNETT: Alright, Rik Ferguson, the senior security advisor at Trend Micro. Appreciate your time talking to me via webcam as we continue to keep an eye on the Conficker worm, expected to activate on April 1st. From the CNN Center, I'm Errol Barnett. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go AZUZ: And finally, we've got spirit, yes we do. But how 'bout these guys? Apparently, they do too, but they need some help harnessing it. That's why they're at mascot boot camp, churning through cheers, perfecting poses and probably sweating like crazy in those suits. Mascots actually have to learn how to whip a crowd into a frenzy, which apparently involves shaking a tail feather or two. We won't make any opinions about who's the best mascot. Goodbye AZUZ: And besides, we wouldn't want it to give any of them a big head. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.

Did Jamie Oliver really shape up town?By Hanna Raskin, Special to CNN Jamie Oliver's mission: Help Huntington, West Virginia, change its food habits. A town spokeswoman says give them some credit. STORY HIGHLIGHTSCelebrity chef Jamie Oliver takes on obesity in Huntington, West VirginiaJamie Oliver's "Food Revolution" set to debut on ABC on SundaySpokeswoman says residents are exercising and eating better, but not because of OliverEditor's Note: Jamie Oliver will appear on CNN's "Larry King Live" on Thursday, March 25, at 9 p.m. ET. (CNN) -- Did Jamie Oliver really shape up America's unhealthiest city? A spokeswoman for Huntington, West Virginia -- the city Oliver singled out as one of the unhealthiest places in America -- says local residents are exercising and eating better. But she's not giving much credit to the cheeky British chef and nutrition activist. "What people need to realize is there was already a movement to make Huntington healthier," says Brandi Jacobs-Jones, whose West Virginia hometown plays a starring role in Oliver's new macro-makeover show "Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution," set to debut on ABC on Sunday. Huntington first made its way into the national consciousness in 2008, when The Associated Press named it "America's fattest city," citing unmatched rates of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, and rates of toothlessness among older residents.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a morbidity and mortality report released in February, said that 32.9 percent of the populace surveyed in an area that included Huntington and nearby Ashland, Kentucky, is obese. Jacob-Jones disputes those findings, saying the survey covered a broad tri-state area surrounding her college town. "People think we're all morbidly obese, walking around eating pizza," she grumbles. "We have 5Ks every weekend. When the production crew came here, I was like 'We have our teeth. We have master's degrees.' " Not everyone is so tough on the celebrity chef. Angela Harrison, a TV reviewer for the Huntington Herald-Dispatch, says the show doesn't portray Huntington badly. Actually, she says, "Oliver is very complimentary of Huntington and its people throughout the entire hour -- even when they give him a hard time." Harrison says "no one cuts him any slack" when Huntington residents learn about disparaging comments the Naked Chef made about them to British press. "I personally think it's the best moment of the show," Harrison says. Oliver and his crew descended on Huntington in the fall of 2009 with the admittedly ambitious goal of redefining its residents' relationship with food. His team spent five months consulting with cafeteria workers, coaching veggie-averse schoolchildren and opening up a community kitchen serving wholesome meals. "The health statistics here are some of the most crippling and scary in the world," Oliver says in a show promo, calling Huntington "a dark place." Oliver took on Huntington after successfully reforming the school meal system in the United Kingdom. In the UK, Oliver spearheaded a healthy school lunch campaign that persuaded the government there to allocate more than $400 million for the lunches. If the trailer can be trusted, he apparently assumed his résumé entitled him to a hero's welcome and was stunned to discover skeptics who didn't share his revulsion to processed chicken nuggets. Oliver burst into tears after a hostile interview with a radio host who said, "we don't want to sit around and eat lettuce all day." The trailer then cuts to a weeping Oliver: "They don't understand me," he says, "they don't know why I'm here." To the contrary, Jacobs-Jones says, the city of Huntington already had anti-obesity programs in place when Oliver showed up. His presence only served to "further the mission" by making healthy habits a popular conversation topic. "We are creating a committee to evaluate how we can implement some of Jamie's suggestions," she adds diplomatically. Jacobs-Jones suspects the lasting result of Oliver's extended stay might not be trimmer waistlines, but fattened city coffers. "I firmly believe anything that puts us on the national forefront is good," she says. "We're applying for a Google program right now, and maybe this will help. You never know."

EU hits out at 'unacceptable' travel delays By the CNN Wire Staff UK officials under fire over weatherSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: BA considering transporting passengers by bus from Heathrow to other airportsUK Transport Secretary lays blame for Heathrow chaos on "over-optimistic" operatorEuropean Commission vice president slams disruption as "unacceptable"Thousands of passengers waiting for flights in Europe airports, rail stations London (CNN) -- Passengers struggling to get away for the holiday season faced further frustration and delays Tuesday, as the EU's top travel official slammed snow disruptions across the region as "unacceptable." Heavy snow caused severe disruption to train and plane schedules in a number of major cities days before Christmas, forcing thousands of people to sleep in terminals while they waited for information on their onward journey. "I am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across Europe caused by severe snow. It is unacceptable and should not happen again," European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said in a written statement. He took issue with airport infrastructure which he said was the "weak link" in the chain, and urged airports to "get serious" about planning for severe weather conditions. Have you been affected? Send photos, video Thousands of passengers endured another frustrating day at London's Heathrow Airport Tuesday as airlines struggled to clear the backlog of passengers after two days of cancellations.

Gallery: Winter weather hits Europe
Only one of the airport's two runways was operating, following cancellations during the previous two days due to heavy snow. Kylie Deegennars said she had been sleeping on the terminal floor since arriving at Heathrow late on Saturday. "We got told on that evening that if we wanted until 6 a.m. the next morning we'd get more information. We did not get a blanket or a bottle of water until 1.30 a.m. in the morning," she said. Conditions hadn't improved since then and Monday night she was still waiting for confirmation of a flight. "We're younger, we've got resistance, but there are babies, there are elderly people, and they're getting no extra treatment than anyone else. It's disgusting," she said. On Tuesday afternoon, British Airways announced that it was considering transporting passengers stranded at Heathrow by bus to other UK airports. Terminal five, it said, had been closed as staff worked to clear the backlog of people crowding the main concourse. London Heathrow is to remain open for the next 24 hours, British Airways said, adding that it was considering bringing planes back overnight to clear the load. The airline said London's Gatwick terminal was "congested but not unmanageable." Colleagues Sharon and Cathy were trying to get back to Phoenix, Arizona after suffering a two-day delay to their flights from Munich, Germany. They have been stranded at Heathrow airport since Monday. "We really felt that we were flying into the eye of the storm and it didn't make much sense to do that, but here we are. We've been told our best chance of getting out is on December 27," Sharon said. The colleagues say they are "lucky" to be put up in a hotel by their company, and expressed sympathy for others stranded in the airport with little or no information, accommodation or money. "It looks like a refugee camp. People have been staying there for days. There were guards at the doors of Terminal one not allowing other people to come in. We were a little concerned about leaving the terminal that we might not be able to get back in," Sharon said. The British government has come under fire for failing to heed warnings about the incoming inclement weather. This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator--Philip Hammond, UK Transport Secretary
Defending the government, UK Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said, "Nobody foresaw the really extreme temperatures that we've had." He laid the blame for chaos at Heathrow Airport firmly at the door of airport operator BAA who he said made a "bad call" on Saturday when the snow first started to present problems. "This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator who was, as it turned out, over-optimistic about their ability to leave the airport open," he said. The government had offered military manpower to help clear runways which had been rejected, Hammond said. He added that the government was working with authorities to ensure the smooth supply of de-icing equipment and other materials to keep the airport operating. British transport expert David Quarmby, author of an independent audit on the resilience of England's transport system, said that the country could not be expected to be able to cope as well as other cities that regularly experience heavy snowfall. "We had a severe winter last winter and a bit of a winter the year before. But for eight years before that we hardly saw any snow at all," he said. "It's very difficult to justify investing in the resources that you find in airports and rail systems and highways in countries elsewhere which always have winters that are as severe as the one that we've got at the moment." The travel disruption was not limited to airports. Long queues snaked around St. Pancras International railway station in London Tuesday as Eurostar canceled 10 trains, or about 20 percent its normal service between London and Paris. "Due to the continuing bad weather, speed restrictions are in place on our high speed lines, adding up to two hours to journey times. As a result we can not operate as many trains as planned," said Eurostar spokeswoman Mary Walsh. Snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance. Better preparedness, in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra--Siim Kallas, European Commission VP

Passengers ignored advice to turn up at the station one hour before departure. Some queued for as long as four hours in the London drizzle before stepping foot inside the terminal. During the wait, they were offered pizza, curry, coffee and tea, according to CNN's Jim Boulden. Earlier, hundreds of passengers camped at Paris train stations, including Eurostar's Paris terminal, Monday night while they waited news of the next train, French transport minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio Tuesday. Around 3,000 passengers on cancelled flights slept on the floor at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, while another 400 spent the night at Orly airport, she said. Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, CEO of Air France KLM said efforts had been made to find stranded passengers a hotel room. "We found 4,000, but we couldn't find anymore," Gourgeon told French radio. A message on the Paris airports website said air traffic was "slowly resuming" after severe snow disruptions. Passengers were advised to check whether their flights had been cancelled before traveling to the airport. Heavy snowfall halted all plane travel at Frankfurt airport in Germany for a short time Tuesday, said Thomas Uber, an airport spokesman. By mid-morning in Europe, the number of canceled flights had risen to 464, mostly due to backlogs and disruptions at other airports, an official said. About 50 flights had been canceled at Munich airport, also due to disruptions elsewhere. German Transport Minster Peter Ramsauer has asked German state authorities to allow night flights on a case-by-case basis to ease travel chaos at airports. Major German airports have restrictions on night flights usually from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and only allow night flights on a very limited basis or in cases of emergencies. On Tuesday afternoon Belgian authorities had started putting passengers whose flights had been diverted from Heathrow Airport to Brussels on coaches and boats to London. In a statement posted on its website, the airport advised passengers bound for Frankfurt on Lufthansa flights to make their way independently by train or car. European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said he would convene a meeting of European airport representatives in coming days to demand an explanation and assurances that they can handle future snow disruptions. "We have seen in recent years that snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance. Better preparedness, in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra, it must be planned for and with the necessary investment, particularly on the side of the airports," he said. The UK's Met Office says it is not expecting further snow in London Wednesday and that Heathrow and Gatwick airports "should remain dry."CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Fred Pleitgen, Phil Han and Jim Boulden contributed to this report.

Perfect pitch: How to get a sport into the Olympics
By Tom McGowan, CNN
updated 12:43 PM EDT, Tue August 14, 2012
Nicol David is a six-time world champion who is fronting a campaign aimed at getting squash into the 2020 Olympics.
The Malaysian is starring in a wide variety of promotional material, in addition to creating a Facebook page aimed at raising awareness of the campaign.
David was joined at the promotional shoot by Ramy Ashour, the Egyptian who is ranked fourth in the men's game.
The promotion is being guided by Verocom, the company behind Rio's successful 2016 bid and the campaign which saw the 2022 FIFA World Cup awarded to Qatar.
Rugby sevens will be part of the Olympic program for the first time in Rio four years from now. A campaign by Mike Lee and Verocom helped the shortened version of the sport successfully lobby the International Olympic Committee for a place at the Games.
In 2016, golf will return to the Games for the first time since 1904. Back then it was an amateur game, but now highly-paid professionals such as PGA champion Rory McIlroy will be able to take part.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Squash is one of the sports bidding to be part of the 2020 Olympic Games
Nicol David is a six-time world champion hope to compete for a gold medal at the Games
Verocom are heading the campaign, having help Rio win the 2016 Games
A decision on which sport will enter in 2020 will be made in Buenos Aires next year
(CNN) -- Winning a gold medal is the pinnacle of any Olympic athlete's career, and most have to be happy for the chance to participate on sport's biggest stage.
For Nicol David, however, time is running out. The Malaysian is the top-ranked women's squash player and a six-time world champion, but she has never competed at the Games. So, at the age of 28, she is trying to rectify the situation before it's too late.
Squash has never been an Olympic sport, and it failed in its bid to be one of the 36 included at London 2012 -- and in Rio in four years' time, when its application was rejected while golf and rugby succeeded.
However, David is fronting a campaign which aims to secure squash a place in the 2020 program and thus achieve her lifelong ambition.
"After the world championships last year I was asked how much I wanted to be part of the Games," she told CNN.
What Rio 2016 can learn from London 2012
Congratulations Team USA!
How it all went right for Britain "I said I would trade all six of my world titles for just one Olympic gold medal. Every world title means the world to me, so that's how important the Olympics is in my heart."
But, due to the way the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decides which sports enter the Games, the dreams of an athlete in another discipline must be shattered for David's to come true.
In order to maintain the Olympics' prestige, and ensure it is still feasible for one city to host all of the events, the IOC will only introduce a new sport if an existing one is removed from the program.
"You have a long list of sports trying to get onto the program because it is their one way to showcase their sport to the world," explains former IOC marketing director Michael Payne.
"The IOC undertakes a very detailed technical analysis to understand the popularity of the sport, the number of players, infrastructure, TV, media and then finally takes a vote to decide which new sport is welcomed onto the program."
There is one man who knows more than most what it takes to convince the IOC of a sport's Olympic worth.
Mike Lee is the chairman of Verocom, an organization which has successfully overseen campaigns to bring the Games to Rio in 2016, the Winter Olympics to Pyongchang in 2018 and the FIFA World Cup to Qatar in 2022.
Lee and his team also navigated a course which gained rugby sevens acceptance into the 2016 Games. In makes perfect sense, then, for Verocom to spearhead squash's Olympic bid.
"You have to look in considerable detail at, not just the sport itself, what it might offer to the Olympic Games, what it brings to the Olympic program," said Lee, former director of communications and public affairs for London 2012's successful bid.
"What do you offer to the Olympic experience? What is it your sport will do to enhance the Games, in a way which is also in line with the spirit and the values of the Games?"
In a manner of speaking, squash has been sexed up in a bid to make itself more attractive to the IOC, making vibrant changes to the courts and apparatus.
During the day, the Olympic Park in London is heaving with people going to and from events and seeing the sights. But at night, it's a different story. One day towards the end of the Olympics fortnight, CNN's Linnie Rawlinson stayed to see what happens once spectators are all inside the venues, watching their evening games. Though night was falling, and a little rain was too, the live broadcast in the Olympic Park continued ...
... watched by many hardy Olympics fans who'd purchased park tickets or stayed on after watching the day's events. In the absence of large crowds, mounted police officers had time to chat to spectators - who took the opportunity to admire their horses, too.
The picnic area outside the Copper Box, crowded earlier in the day, was almost deserted at dusk. Artist Monica Bonvicini's permanent sculpture, "Run," shone brightly in front of it. The venue will become a multi-purpose venue for community and sporting events. Even the Coca Cola beat box -- an interactive installation featuring music by Mark Ronson -- was quiet. The stadium and the Orbit stood out against the cloudy East London sky and reflected in the River Lea, which flows through the park. The stadium was hosting athletics that night. I could hear the crowd roaring from inside the stadium, but the ticket gate was as far as I could go. After the Games, the stadium will hold sports, community and entertainment events, with a focus on athletics. The Aquatic Centre shone neon yellow beyond wildflower planting on the banks of the River Lea. The venue's curved center, designed by architect Zaha Hadid, will remain after the Games. The sweeping wings either side are temporary stands that will be dismantled at the end of the Games. Anish Kapoor's "Orbit Tower," a permanent artwork and the tallest art structure in Britain, attracted many of my fellow stragglers, its vivid red form illuminated brightly against the sky. The Aquatic Centre with the Water Polo Arena in the background. From this angle, the Arena almost looked like a blue whale rising up from the Lea. The lights in its roof pulsed from blue to green to purple. The Water Polo Arena, seen beyond the River Lea, is the first dedicated water polo venue to be built for an Olympic Games. Its components will be reused or recycled after the Games. Two Eton Manor volunteers took a moment for a quiet conversation in front of the "bit.fall" installation by artist Julius Popp. Words taken from live news headlines are projected at random onto five man-made waterfalls under the Stratford Gate bridge.
Once the evening's athletics had finished, crowds poured from the Olympic Stadium. Dancers guided the crowds towards the exits and wished them a safe journey home.
It was time for me to head home too. I bade the Olympic Park farewell, knowing it'd be the last time I'd see the five Olympic rings emblazoned against the East London sky.

London 2012: Top-10 sporting moments
"The sport has worked very hard to innovate, to make it much more fan and broadcast friendly, from all-glass courts to the camera positions, to the use of a video review system and a white ball," he said.
"They're now experimenting with glass floors. This is a sport that has moved itself considerably over the last few years. It has been on the basis of making itself more friendly to the spectators at the event or the viewers on television."
A wide variety of sports are covered within the Games, from BMX to equestrian, catering to tastes and interests from all over the world. If squash is to enter the "greatest show on Earth," it will have to fend off fierce competition.
"Softball and baseball, which came out of the Games for London, karate, roller sports, sports climbing, wakeboarding, wushu (a martial art) and the sport which comes out of the Games," replied World Squash CEO Andrew Shelley when asked about its rivals.
"We've bid twice before. Whilst we weren't perhaps ready, we had a lot of very good advice from the IOC and we've learned a lot from them.
"This time the process is very clear. There is one place available due to the taking out of a sport by the IOC after the Games in London.
"Our sport is scrutinized and evaluated alongside all the other candidates. If we're fortunate, we come out on top at the meeting in Buenos Aires in 2013."
Squash will hope to follow in the footsteps of rugby sevens and golf, which have been added to the program for the Games' South American debut in Rio.

Olympics: American gold medals
London's Olympic Park has transformed Stratford in east London. The area was once a post-industrial wasteland, blighted by pollution. Today it is a bright, colorful park.
After years of hard work, the contaminated land has been cleaned up and planted with wildflowers all the colors of the rainbow.
They provide an oasis of calm in the heart of the bustling Olympic Park, which has welcomed thousands of sports fans in recent weeks.
An army of volunteers clad in bright purple, red and pink welcome visitors to the Games.
The volunteers have been credited with helping ensure the success of London's Olympics, creating a happy, positive mood in the city.
Even the traditional British summer weather hasn't been able to dampen the spirits of fans from all over the world.
Huge support for Team GB has helped the home side shoot up the medal table.
Brits hope the country's renewed optimism will be one of the lasting legacies of the Games.

Olympic Games leave London with a golden glow
"Rugby sevens was looked at as a very professional campaign," Lee said. "One of the keys was how a tournament over two or three days would enhance the Olympic Games.
"It's not difficult to stage, as long as you've got stadia. It doesn't have to be a rugby stadium, it can be played in many types of stadiums. It's something which is very attractive to young people and the party atmosphere which goes with it."
So what would squash bring to the Games which is not already on offer?
"Squash is a worldwide sport," Shelley said. "We have world champions from all continents and it is played in 185 countries. It is a sport we feel will add something to the Olympics, as well as being a great opportunity for our athletes.
"There was an IOC official many years ago who told me, 'You've got to wait until the train comes into the station and stops. When it does, you've got to be ready.' We're ready, we're just waiting for the train now."
Even if squash is given the green light in Buenos Aires next year, it may come too late for David to reap the rewards of her enthusiastic work.
But, whatever the future has in store for her, she is determined to see squash elevated to the pantheon of Olympic sports.
"It's a dream of mine to be part of the Games," she said. "I'm going to do whatever it takes to get in there. I want to do whatever I can to get there and get squash in there as well.
"Whatever happens, I'll keep working hard because I want to see squash in there someday. If it is not this time, hopefully the next time."

Judge stops NYC ban on large sugary drinks, city plans appeal
By CNN Staff
updated 4:04 PM EDT, Mon March 11, 2013
a New York State Supreme Court judge called an upcoming limit on the large drinks is "arbitrary and capricious." Prepping for NYC's ban on sugary drinks
(CNN) -- A state judge in New York on Monday invalidated the city's upcoming ban on sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in certain venues, a major setback for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has backed several laws aimed at New Yorkers' health.
The limit on the large drinks is "arbitrary and capricious," a New York State Supreme Court judge ruled Monday.
The measure was to take effect Tuesday, and Bloomberg's office said in a Twitter message that the city will appeal.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Many parents worry about the impact of Cyrus' performance on her young fans Cyrus' VMA show another example of the sexualization of young girls, said some parents
Others argued that kids should not have been watching the VMAs in the first place One upside to Cyrus' VMA appearance is that it may show strength, said one mom Editor's note: Miley Cyrus kicked off her "Bangerz" concert tour just this month, and already she's spanked a backup dancer, smooched fellow songstress Katy Perry and slid onto stage via a giant replica of her own tongue. Cyrus' penchant for explicit performances has us at CNN Living wondering: Would you take your kids to see her tour, or is the former Hannah Montana persona non grata in your household? Share your opinion in the comments section and click through the gallery above to view photos from Miley's career and her latest tour. Below is a column by CNN Parents' Kelly Wallace on Cyrus' eye-popping performance at the MTV Music Awards last summer.
(CNN) -- My list of reasons why I'm glad my girls, ages 5 and 7, were too young to ever get into "Hannah Montana" grew exponentially longer after Miley Cyrus' unforgettable "twerking" in a bra and undies at MTV's Video Music Awards.
"Miley, what exactly were you thinking?" pretty much sums up the sentiment I heard from outraged moms and dads around the country who believe Cyrus, whose loyal fan base includes a huge chunk not yet old enough to drive, should know better.
"It's a damn shame that Miley is doing this to herself, making a vulgar joke out of her talents and her beauty, but it's a much bigger shame that she's doing it to her young fans and other young people (who) see her in the media," said Heidi Cardenas, a mom of two teenage boys, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page.
"It's the same thing as going to any street corner in America and selling herself for money," said Cardenas.
"I have to instantly think that Miley does not either a) care what her younger fans think of her or b) hasn't even bothered to think of what her actions (are) doing to her image," said Larene Grady, a mom of two whose tween was "absolutely infatuated" with Cyrus but isn't anymore.

Photos: Evolution of Miley Cyrus
From teen queen to all grown-up
"She thinks Miley does not appeal to children (who) used to like her as 'Hannah Montana,' which speaks volumes coming from a 10-year-old who had two 'Hannah Montana' parties, everything from bed sheets, pajamas, bath soaps, toothbrushes and book bags," Grady added, also in response to a tout on CNN's Facebook page.
Miley Cyrus twerks, stuns VMAs crowd
"Hannah Montana" seems about as relevant to the current day Cyrus as a typewriter is to millenials.
The 20-year-old has every right to chart a new course beyond her Disney days, moms and dads said in comments on Facebook and exchanges via e-mail. It's just that the path she is choosing seems so wrong and dangerous, many said.
Sonia Prince of Nashua, New Hampshire, said her kids -- ages 9, 12 and 13 -- will no longer be listening to Cyrus' music. "There is enough fantastic music out there with people who have respectful behavior, especially women who don't feel the need to be sexual in public in order to be successful," she added.
Cyrus' choice to wear next to nothing and strut around the VMA stage is yet another example, frustrated parents say, of the sexualization of our young girls, an issue we touched on at CNN.com just a few weeks ago in our piece on how too many tween fashions are too sexy, skimpy and short.
"I do think Miley wrongly represents the way girls should act today," said Steve, a CNN commenter who shared his first name and the fact that he has a 12-year-old granddaughter.
"The way they dress, act, not caring about how other people may respond to your actions," Steve added. "I think it is an oversexualization of young girls/young women."
Robin Belkin, a mom of three in Northern California, believes Cyrus' performance only adds to the already "damaging image of women-as-sex-objects."
"I just find it extremely discouraging and difficult to hold out hope for the improved status of women in this world when even the most entitled among us so negatively reinforce the worst stereotypes and misogynistic attitudes about women," said Belkin.
Opinion: Miley Cyrus is sexual, get over it
"Her behavior sets 50 to 60 years of women's forward progress back a long way when you consider that her huge fan base really only consists of young and impressionable girls and horny young boys, who, unfortunately on many levels, are our future leaders," said John Rodrigues of Boston, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page.
Miley Cyrus follows post-child star path
Miley Cyrus' performance shocks fans
Critic: Miley gave me nightmares
"Growing up under the impression that this behavior is not only OK, but acceptable, is such a terrible message and, in this case, I am happy I'm not a father trying to keep this away from my children," the 35-year-old single Army veteran added.
Eric Solomon, a father of two, watched the VMAs with his 15-year-old son. "I am so embarrassed and sitting next to my son and watching this happen made me even more embarrassed," he added.
Solomon said he has conversations with his sons about what's right and what's wrong, and said that they know Cyrus' performance was "not appropriate" and not the behavior of "your normal woman."
Mary Hogan of Cordova, Tennessee, doesn't have kids but works in education and says parents have a role to play.
"Parents need to explain to their kids that what she did is not OK, and should not be imitated," said Hogan, adding that parents who didn't like what they were seeing should have changed the channel.
"I think the biggest responsibility for a parent is to know what their kids are watching," said Mark Edwards of suburban St. Louis, who has three teenage sons. "The VMAs aren't appropriate for kids under a certain age and if some parents feel discomfort over what was aired, should they have been letting their kids watch the show in the first place?"
"The VMAs are supposed to be shocking," said a woman who did not want to be identified. "Why is Miley Cyrus such a big deal? ... I am more shocked people are watching the VMAs with their children."
Miley Cyrus upholds MTV VMAs tradition
After all, consider VMA highlights of years past when Lady Gaga donned a dress made entirely of raw meat and Madonna and Britney Spears kissed (mouths open!). It was, in fact, at the VMAs years earlier when Madonna broke out onto the national stage with her "Like a Virgin" performance.
Cyrus "took a page straight out of Madonna's playbook," said Ivan Baker, a father in New York City, on Facebook. "I guess I am jaded. Not very impressed or shocked."
While much of the online conversation post-Cyrus' national "twerking" episode was dominated by criticism, there was also a very motherly and fatherly response, parents who worry that Cyrus is a child in need of serious help.
"It's clear that Miley Cyrus' lifestyle as a young woman is expressing pain and is dealing with emotional problems," said Andrew Thompson, an engaged father of two boys in Country Club Hills, Illinois.
"Her mother and father have a responsibility to come to her aid and work out these social issues before it's too late," he added.
Some parents said there was only one upside they could see from the blistering reaction to Cyrus' performance and that is that it may show strength.

"The fact that she doesn't play the victim and shows that girls can be as aggressive and bad in many ways might in some twisted way pave the way for (women) to play in a more level field with men," said Leigh Bordbar, a mom of two from Toronto who said she was personally disappointed with what Cyrus did at the VMAs. "In her performance, she seemed like the one in control and in the driver's seat, which sets her apart from the ways that perhaps Playboy or fashion models portray women."
Nicky Calvert, a mom of two in Marietta, Ohio, sees another positive.
"There is only one good thing that I can say about her performance on the VMAs," said Calvert. It shows her 9-year-old how she "should never act in public."
May I repeat how happy I am my girls missed this one completely.

Are you an early adopter?
I knew a lot of angry people when Apple decided to drop the price of the 8GB iPhone by $200 last Wednesday. Wouldn't you have been angry if you had paid $600 or a full 1/3 more than everybody else just for the privilege of owning an iPhone 3 months earlier?This has got some people talking about a condition called the early adopter syndrome. "It's a lack of impulse control in the presence of new technologies," according to Tom Creeds of St. John's University.So, who is an early adopter? I knew I had heard the term before. Were early adopters really just suckers who bought the latest gadgets at premium prices? The term stems back to diffusion theory. It's a domino effect theory based on psychology and it beats in the heart of today’s marketing campaigns. Everett Rogers's "Diffusion of Innovations," published in 1995, is the textbook for diffusion theory. The idea is that early adopters set trends. Imagine a hill or a bell curve graph. Early adopters would be on the left, the big bulge in the middle is the majority in the middle or the mainstream and the laggards are all the way on the right. Early adopters are the target audience for all marketers. They don't shy away from newness and uncertainty and they are happy to incorporate cutting edge innovations. They are the people who will bring a cool new product to the mainstream. They make up just 13.5% of the population. Here's the breakdown:(1) Innovators - 2.5%(2) Early adopters - 13.5%(3) Early majority - 34%(4) Late majority - 34%(5) Laggards - 16%Basically, early adopters shape opinions and influence their friends. We all know somebody who is always on the early edge of trends. The person who knows about a great band months before anybody else. The person who waited on line for the Nintendo Wii long before everyone else had one. Dr. Donald Berwick calls them "self-conscious experimenters," in a 2003 Journal of the American Medical Association article.Many tech writers refer to what they call early adopter syndrome, or confess to being a technoholic, but all joking aside, you can get burned. Such as in the case with the iPhones. By the way, Apple is offering credits to appease iPhone's early adopters.Buying new technology often means it's unproven and needs testing, but early adopters often forego the risk for the possible benefits.Are you an early adopter? Do you know any early adopters? Do you think this theory of trend-setting makes sense?

It took me 5 years to finally buy an iPod. The benefit was cheaper price for a better model. I think early adopters should pay the premium price for whatever technology comes out. That's the price you pay for the privelege of being "the first".
Posted By Anonymous : 2:29 PM ET Hi Chris,I do health services implementation research. Diffusion theory is used in this field, as well, to target and evaluate how to get medical facilities and providers to adopt new medical treatments. The theory holds true in my field, so I'd assume it holds true for "fun gadgetry" marketing. There's a mistaken belief among some that either you're an early-adopter or not; you're a laggard or not...as if your place on this curve is a static personality trait. However, something I consider interesting and challenging is how any one person's place in the bell-curve of diffusion changes over the course of their life or depending on the type of service being provided. The young early-adopters become older laggards with time. The laggards in one area are the early majority in another. It's very hard to keep up!
Posted By Anonymous : 3:27 PM ET I agree with the first comment. Everybody knows the price goes down if you wait, and I don't feel bad for anyone who paid $600 for an iPhone.
Posted By Anonymous : 8:56 AM ET Agreed...I have no regrets of buying the iPhone on the first day! Wait for a couple of years, you'll probably get it free even!
Posted By Anonymous : 9:19 AM ET The issue really isn't being an early adopter, its more along the lines of being a compulsive buyer. I would consider myself an early adopter, yet I don't have an iPhone. Why? Because I did my research. The iPhone did NOTHING new that my current cell phone doesn't do. Rather, I saw it for what it was; a bunch of ads reselling you an existing product for more money while trying to make you feel you are being avant guarde, an outside the box thinker, and one of a kind. However, I just read that the millionth iPhone just sold...Now if you own an iPhone, you are one of a million. Its the same reason why the iPod is such a good seller; catchy ads selling to an uninformed, compulsive market.
Posted By David : 9:58 AM ET I find the contention that early adopters "lack impulse control" ridiculous, to tell you the truth. People who lack impulse control are known as impulse buyers, they are the kind of folks who the Walmart floorplan is designed for. But early adopters (using myself as an example) will buy new technologies as they become available, to see what they do, and how they work, and how they are useful. We cannot rely on reviewers, because they don't have to pay for what they review, and deadline pressure makes it impossible for them to integrate a new product into their daily lives before they write about it. It helps that I do R&D for a living, but "ordinary users", many of whom I know from corporate America, can be just as "impulsive". Early adopters of the Blackberry largely got one because you could read and write email with it, facilitated by the back office server technology, and the QWERTY keyboard. Early adopters of the Macintosh got one because it had a multitasking windowing environment and an on-board network. I would never describe those folks as "impulse buyers", they are simply forward thinking technology adopters. And no, you can't get burned being an early adopter - you learn from it, and the vendor learns from you.
Posted By Menno : 11:22 AM ET I would be an early adopter if money permitted. I love gadgets and enjoy playing around with them and seeing what they can do. I would be happy to pay a premium price to be able to play with a gadget shortly after it came to market.While I am not an early adopter, as you define one, I am the early adopter of my social set. I constantly read up on new technology and buy new items as I can afford them.
