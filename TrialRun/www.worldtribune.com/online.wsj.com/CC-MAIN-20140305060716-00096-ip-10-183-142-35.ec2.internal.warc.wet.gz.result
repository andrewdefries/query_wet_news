Apple prueba pantallas más grandes para iPhones y iPads

Por LORRAINE LUK Reuters
Un iPhone 5 de Apple y un Galaxy S4 de Samsung Electronics.
TAIPEI—Apple Inc. y sus proveedores asiáticos están probando pantallas más grandes para los iPhones y tabletas, dicen directivos de los proveedores de la empresa. En los últimos meses, Apple ha pedido prototipos de pantallas más grandes de 4 pulgadas para los teléfonos inteligentes, y también pidió diseños de pantallas para un nuevo dispositivo tableta con una medida ligeramente menor a las 13 pulgadas en diagonal, dijeron. El actual iPhone 5 tiene una pantalla de 4 pulgadas, mientras que el actual iPad a la venta tiene una pantalla de 9,7 pulgadas. El iPad Mini, una versión más simple de su computadora tableta, tiene una pantalla de 7,9 pulgadas. No está claro si los diseños llegarán al mercado. La empresa con sede en Cupertino, California, realiza de manera rutinaria pruebas de diferentes diseños para sus productos a medida que los refina durante el desarrollo. La empresa también cambió sus ofertas para el iPhone y el iPod el año pasado para incluir pantallas más grandes, y añadió una variante del iPad con una pantalla más pequeña. Una portavoz de Apple declinó hacer comentarios. Las pruebas con los proveedores parecen sugerir que Apple está explorando maneras para capturar las diversas necesidades de los consumidores en un momento en que muchos de los fabricantes de dispositivos móviles ofrecen teléfonos inteligentes y tabletas en varios tamaños. Su rival más grande en los mercados de tabletas y teléfonos inteligentes, la surcoreana Samsung Electronics Co., tiene una estrategia de "de todo para todo tipo de personas" que cubre diferentes tamaños de productos para capturar tantos clientes como sea posible. La medida ha permitido a Samsung superar a Apple en el mercado de teléfonos inteligentes, aunque Apple aún lidera en tabletas. En el primer trimestre, Samsung era el fabricante de teléfonos inteligentes líder con una participación de mercado de 33,1%, mientras que Apple lo seguía en segundo lugar con 17,9%, según la empresa de investigaciones Strategy Analytics. En tabletas, Apple aún domina el mercado, pero su participación disminuyó a 39,6% en los tres meses finalizados el 31 de marzo, desde 58,1% un año atrás, según IDC. Samsung, que usa el sistema operativo de Google Inc., Android, registró un aumento de su participación de mercado en tabletas desde 11,3% hace un año a 17,9%.

The biggest challenge with family business succession planning is the interpersonal relationships between parties. Unlike conventional business succession where two parties reach an agreement that everyone feels is a fair deal, in family situations people often come away from the negotiating table with hurt feelings. More in Wealth Management Journal Is There Pay Dirt in Farms? Tax Tips for the Next Two Months When Adult Kids Ask 'The Bank of Mom and Dad' for Money Read the complete report . People carry an enormous amount of baggage from their childhood. Sometimes you'll hear the real issue preventing a compromise is that someone felt picked on in fourth grade by their siblings. Situations like that often require conflict mediation and family counseling, as well as savvy business planning. Financial advisers aren't therapists, and to pretend otherwise is both disingenuous and counterproductive. It's my job to point out what can go wrong to my clients, and find other specialists to fix those things when they do go wrong. So if there are resentments standing in the way of compromise, we bring in counselors. On the financial side, often the business is the largest single asset owned by the generation looking to transfer it. So the question is: Does the succession plan involve a buyout, a gift, or a transfer of assets in some kind of trust vehicle? Will the kids all be owners, but only one of them work there? That can raise all kinds of problems. Take, for example, a situation where a business accounts for $5 million of a $7 million estate and one child ends up getting it. Even if the son or daughter who is running that business worked hard to earn the right to do so, siblings will tend to feel cheated. They may even contest the will. That highlights the importance of reaching an agreement about succession while everyone is living. Mr. Brotman is president and managing principal of Brotman Financial Group in Baltimore.

James Taranto
February 24, 2012
A month ago, Charles Blow of the New York Times blocked this columnist on Twitter in reaction to our pointing out that one of his tweets was fallacious. The Blow tweet in that incident was racially charged but offensive only to logic. Now, however, Blow is coming under fire for a pair of tweets that are not just foolish but bigoted and hateful. Podcast James Taranto on Charles Blow's rhetoric. Blow apologized this morning for one of them: "Btw, the comment I made about Mormonism during Wed.'s debate was inappropriate, and I regret it. I'm willing to admit that with no caveats." The comment in question reads as follows: "Let me just tell you this Mitt 'Muddle Mouth': I'm a single parent and my kids are *amazing*! Stick that in your magic underwear. #CNNdebate" "Magic underwear" is a snide way of referring to an article of symbolic religious clothing. As Carlos Asay explains in an essay on the website of the Mormon church: It is the special underclothing known as the temple garment, or garment of the holy priesthood, worn by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have received their temple endowment. This garment, worn day and night, serves three important purposes: it is a reminder of the sacred covenants made with the Lord in His holy house, a protective covering for the body, and a symbol of the modesty of dress and living that should characterize the lives of all the humble followers of Christ. Blow's comment about "magic underwear" was not only bigoted but completely gratuitous. The Times columnist was apparently set off by Romney's debate comments about the problem of out-of-wedlock childbearing, which had nothing to do with the candidate's religion. As in the case of the racially charged January tweet, Blow seems to have felt personally attacked--in this case as a single parent, in the earlier one as a black person--by a GOP candidate's comment, and lashed out personally in response. Blow blows it.
NYTimes.com Curiously, as blogger Tom Maguire notes, Blow himself has written on the dangers of single-parent households to black children in particular--in 2008, when he congratulated Barack Obama for his candor in raising the question. How does one square that with the reflexive offense Blow took when Romney (and Rick Santorum) talked about the question? Perhaps the criticism is easier to stomach coming from a black man. But Obama is not only a black man, he is also a national politician. And the problem of out-of-wedlock births is not only a black problem, as Charles Murray shows in his new book. Our national debate is impoverished to the extent that people are excluded from discussing important social problems on the ground of their racial or partisan profile. The impulse behind both Blow's January tweet and his "magic underwear" one is a destructive and ignorant one. When our Twitter timeline started lighting up with chatter over Blow's anti-Mormon tweet, we wanted to see what it was he said. We went over to his Twitter page, which we can still view, even though, being blocked, we can't follow him. There we found something truly shocking: Time to scratch some of this right wing lice out of my timeline. Be back in a sec... #block Remember when the Times lectured us on civility and warned of "eliminationist rhetoric" from the right? It was largely bunk. But here we have a Times columnist likening his political critics to vermin. To be sure, he is not actually going to exterminate them, as others who've used such metaphors down through history have been known to do. Blow's comments, that is, are not dangerous. But they are profoundly disturbed and indecent. The Case Against the Libertarian Case Against Santorum In last Thursday's column, we criticized The Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf for attempting to write Rick Santorum "out of the American tradition" because Santorum has argued that the wide availability of contraception has deleterious social consequences. To Friedersdorf's credit, he responded to our somewhat harsh criticism not by blocking us on Twitter--in fact, he still follows us--but by writing another blog post. We've linked to it atop this item, but we actually want to take another whack at Friedersdorf's original comment, which was that Santorum "cannot . . . credibly invoke a tradition rooted in the pursuit of happiness." Now of course, "the pursuit of happiness" is a phrase from the second sentence of the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." It occurs to us that Friedersdorf's error lies in mistaking the Declaration for a thesaurus. Last week we summarized Santorum's argument as follows: "that the easy availability of birth control has enabled and encouraged a pursuit of pleasure that is inimical to the achievement of happiness." One can agree or disagree with this view, but there is no disputing that the easy availability of birth control has entailed an expansion of personal liberty. The point here is that "liberty" and "the pursuit of happiness" are not synonyms but distinct concepts--rights that are mostly in harmony but not necessarily always so. Libertarians like Friedersdorf often miss that important subtlety. That's not to say libertarians don't have serious arguments against Santorum's philosophy. The best such critique we've read came from Jonathan Rauch, in a September 2005 review of "It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good," for Reason magazine. (The erudite Rauch was ill served by his editors at Reason, who wrote a headline based on a puerile and obscene in-joke.) Rauch draws a parallel between Santorum's book and Barry Goldwater's "The Conscience of a Conservative," published in 1960. "Goldwater's presidential candidacy crashed in 1964, but his ideas did not: For decades, Goldwater's hostility to Big Government ruled the American Right," Rauch wrote. "Until, approximately, now." As Rauch notes, Santorum finds the historical antecedent of his own views far earlier than 1960, in "the liberty our Founders understood," which he defines as "freedom coupled with the responsibility to something bigger or higher than the self." Rauch concedes that some of the Founding Fathers, including George Washington and John Adams, held the view that it was necessary for government to promote virtue. But "Washington and (especially) Adams stood at one end of a spectrum of debate, and it was a debate that they ultimately lost," writes Rauch: Other Founders—notably James Madison, the father of the Constitution—were more concerned with power than with virtue. They certainly distinguished between liberty and license, and they agreed that republican government requires republican virtues. But they believed that government's foremost calling was not to inculcate virtue but to prevent tyranny. Madison thus argued for a checked, limited government that would lack the power to impose any one faction's view of virtue on all others. . . . Goldwater and Reagan, and Madison and Jefferson, were saying that if you restrain government, you will strengthen society and foster virtue. Santorum is saying something more like the reverse: If you shore up the family, you will strengthen the social fabric and ultimately reduce dependence on government. To recruit Ronald Reagan for the libertarian cause is problematic to say the least. True, the Gipper did say, in a 1975 interview with Reason, that "the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism." But the subject of that interview was not social issues. When interviewer Manuel Klausner (who has moved up in the world and is now a frequent contributor to this column) asks the future president to elaborate, he goes on to talk about such esoteric questions as whether fire departments should be privately or publicly owned. By 1980, Reagan was a social conservative, if a less fervent one than Santorum is today. One of his main initiatives as president was the "war on drugs," a term nobody uses today except libertarians in arguing that we should end it. As for Goldwater, it's true that in his dotage he was a strong opponent of social conservatism. "Every good Christian ought to kick Jerry Falwell right in the ass," he memorably said in 1981. But it's also true that Goldwater in 1960 and Madison and Jefferson at the time of the Founding had no knowledge of the sexual revolution, which had yet to occur. Santorum's argument is that what Charles Murray calls the "founding virtues" have been eroded as a result of the sexual revolution. Goldwater disagreed 30 years ago, in part because of his own ideological predisposition but also in part because the evidence was much sketchier back then. Libertarianism, which values liberty above all other values, has always had an uneasy relationship with conservatism, being either a distinct strain of it or a different ideology altogether. It's understandable that libertarians sided with the sexual revolution, since it did expand a certain variety of liberty. But it is far from clear that in embracing this very modern form of freedom, libertarians are being true to the timeless verities embodied in America's founding documents. Santorum has a strong case to make that they are endangering those verities by disparaging the virtues that the Founders had the luxury of being able to take for granted. What Do Women Want? We got a chuckle out of this Washington Post piece: Over the past several weeks, Republicans have watched squeamishly as presidential contender Rick Santorum has waded into multiple controversies that risk alienating half the 2012 electorate: women. But in fact, Santorum has grown more popular among women while talking about his opposition to abortion, his disapproval of birth control and his view that the federal government shouldn't pay for prenatal screenings. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows not only that Santorum is doing better among GOP women than he was a few weeks ago, but also that he is less unpopular--and also less well known--among Democratic and independent women than his Republican rivals Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. So apparently women are more diverse in their views than the political stereotypes might suggest. Imagine that! It's funny how the people who claim to be most devoted to the proposition that men and women are equal also are most devoted to the notion that all women do, or should, think alike.

By

TOKYO—Japan's economic growth accelerated swiftly at the beginning of this year, the most concrete sign yet that new stimulus policies sparking euphoria in financial markets are starting to lift companies and consumers as well. The country's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew at an annualized pace of 3.5% in the first three months of the year, as consumers loosened...

New Investigation Renews Scrutiny of Firearms Agency By
Evan Perez
Updated Jan. 17, 2013 8:12 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—A former federal official who helped oversee an ill-fated effort to stem gun trafficking is under investigation for allegedly carrying on a private trade in firearms—a potential new blow to the agency that is poised to play a big role in the administration's gun-control efforts. The official's alleged private gun trade came to light when Mexican authorities asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to trace the origin of firearms found at the scene of an hourslong gunfight in November between...

is re-engineering itself into a mobile business. Such a transformation has been daunting for one of the world's most-trafficked websites. Just over a year ago, Facebook's mobile business barely existed. Less than two dozen engineers were working on mobile applications as the social network focused on growing its desktop business to a billion users.

Stephen Christopher taught Facebook employees how to develop for Apple's mobile platform at the company's campus on Tuesday.
Alison Yin for The Wall Street Journal All of that began to shift in late 2011 when Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg
realized he had miscalculated. Facebook's own data showed that a large number of users—the company declined to say how much—were going to their phones' Web browsers to access the social network. Meanwhile, mobile startups such as photo-sharing service Instagram were emerging as threats. Facebook reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings Wednesday with revenue boosted from stronger mobile ad sales. But higher costs dragged down the social network's profit.

"If we are going to be a mobile company at scale, we needed to do something qualitatively different," said Mike Shaver,
Facebook's director of mobile engineering. "We needed a nuclear option." Today, hundreds of Facebook's roughly 1,000 engineers are coding for mobile on any given day, including those acquired from Facebook's purchase of Instagram last year. Facebook is holding on-campus classes on Google Inc.

's Android and Apple's iOS mobile operating systems. And it has bombarded consumers and marketers with new mobile products, such as a number of mobile-ad formats and a messaging and photo-sharing application called Poke. More How Facebook Is Gaining on Apple "Facebook's initial brilliance was Web development," said Cory Ondrejka,
vice president of mobile engineering. Now, however, "I couldn't imagine a model where all of Facebook wasn't working on mobile." Enlarge Image

Alison Yin for The Wall Street Journal How successful Mr. Zuckerberg and team have been at refashioning Facebook for a mobile world will become clearer Wednesday, when the social network reports fourth-quarter earnings. In the prior quarter, Facebook showed some glimmers of mobile growth, posting mobile-ad revenue of $153 million, up from zero a year ago. Those results helped renew investors' faith in the company, whose stock has risen 58% since that last earnings report in October when Facebook was worth about half its $104 billion IPO valuation. On Tuesday, Facebook's stock closed at $30.79, down 5%. Now, Wall Street will be looking for the company's mobile-ad revenue to more than double from the third quarter, as well as for signs that users are embracing its latest mobile products. Facebook's missteps with mobile go back to 2006, when the company began building mobile applications. The company bet heavily on HTML5, a programming language that created a basic mobile experience across smartphones and allowed Facebook to be less dependent on Apple and Google's operating systems. But relying on HTML5 also meant Facebook didn't make more fully-featured and speedier apps to run on Android or iOS operating systems. In October 2011, Mr. Ondrejka and other engineers began discussing rewriting Facebook's iPhone app at an engineering summit. Three engineers began building a prototype. When Mr. Ondrejka had enough data he met with Mr. Zuckerberg in the office of Michael Schroepfer,
Facebook's vice president of engineering. Mr. Ondrejka stood in front of a white board and sketched the architectural differences between the current iPhone application and a rewrite and how they could staff up his team to get it done. Mr. Zuckerberg pressed Mr. Ondrejka for more proof that Facebook could rapidly improve its performance with the rewrite. Mr. Ondrejka assured him he finally had the technical resources and engineering expertise to get it done. Not long afterward, Mr. Zuckerberg approved the project, which was code-named "Wilde," in reference to author Oscar Wilde. Mr. Ondrejka's team delivered a working version of the new Facebook app to Mr. Zuckerberg to test a few months later. Last August, Facebook released the revamped mobile app for iOS, followed four months later by an Android version. While the apps don't look different from Facebook's previous versions, they run substantially faster, a critical improvement to help keep users on the mobile app and serve them more ads. At the same time, Facebook ramped up its mobile-ad offerings. The first mobile ads in March were "sponsored stories," which would link back to a brand's mobile page. To make the ad format work, Facebook had to make sure that marketers had vibrant pages to promote. "On the Web, you can create an ad even if you don't have a page post, so with mobile, marketers had to think about actively managing their pages," said Gokul Rajaram,
who manages Facebook's ads products. The company had to blow up some preconceived notions of how to make money off mobile. Previously, Facebook expected to profit from the sale of virtual goods in mobile games, much like how it takes a cut of such sales from desktop games that run atop the social network. Instead, Facebook found that many mobile game developers were reaching consumers directly with their stand-alone apps and didn't need the social network to host the games. "We thought we could replicate" the same games business model on mobile as online, said Doug Purdy,
a Facebook director of product management, before discovering that developers were building stand-alone apps, tailored to the Android and Apple operating systems. So in October, Facebook rolled out a new ad program so developers could pay the social network to promote mobile installations of their games. Facebook also began recruiting more mobile experts. But because Facebook's mobile apps hadn't been cutting edge and the interview process was choppy, "we lost candidates," Mr. Ondrejka said. While the situation has improved, at the time, "people would fall through the cracks, or they just left." Internally, Facebook's engineering corps also had to be retrained to better understand mobile technology. In July 2012, Mr. Shaver organized on-campus classes for mobile training, which are taught by outside consultants. So far, more than 400 people have gone through the program. Still, Facebook's progress in mobile is coming in fits and starts, as underlined by the company's recent Poke mobile app. Released in December, Poke allows people to send messages and photos that self-destruct. The app competes against Snapchat, a popular rival mobile app. Poke last month briefly hit the top of the most downloaded chart for Apple's app store. But it has since fallen outside of the top 400 free apps, according to data from App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. Snapchat, meanwhile, remains in the top 20. "Whether it's Snapchat or Twitter...consumers can be finicky," said Aaron Kessler, an analyst with Raymond James Associates Inc. "That's the real question: Does Facebook have staying power on mobile?"

Updated Nov. 13, 2012 6:47 p.m. ET
The International Monetary Fund, criticized for decades for prescribing harsh medicine to heavily indebted governments, is pressing reluctant euro-zone governments to go easy on Greece. It is a fight the IMF will be hard-pressed to win. It is scaling down the money it lends to Greece, and, as it does so, its influence weakens. It has lent Greece about €22 billion ($28 billion), and has set aside another €26 billion to lend until 2016. The country's main creditor group—the 16 other euro-zone governments led by Germany—are calling most of the shots. IMF officials have repeated that they want to see a realistic agreement in place to back up the release of a new slice of Greek aid. The institution has become increasingly skeptical about the euro zone's prescription of slashing budgets to get debts under control because it has exacted a heavy toll and destroyed economic growth. Enlarge Image
It also argues that the credibility of Greece's economic program—and returning the economy to health—hangs on getting Greece's debt down to manageable levels. Many in the organization see the IMF's own credibility on the line. Its main sanction—pulling out of the Greek program—would deal a confidence-shattering blow to the effort to control the debt crisis across the euro zone. The euro-zone governments' priority is very different: to minimize the cost of aiding Athens. They refuse to extend more loans to Greece beyond those already pledged. Now Greece's largest creditor group after a private debt restructuring this year, the governments are also refusing to countenance the IMF's favored solution of "official-sector involvement," or OSI—jargon for cutting the debts they are owed by Athens. After months of simmering below the surface, the divisions surfaced in public on Monday night. After attending a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde
made clear the Washington-based institution's concern about Greece's heavy debts. Sitting to her right at a news conference, Jean-Claude Juncker,
the Luxembourg prime minister who presides over the ministers' meetings, made equally apparent his view that the route to OSI, arithmetically the easiest way to reduce Greece's debts, is closed. Mr. Juncker said creditors would probably agree to move back to 2022 the date when Greece's public debt falls to the supposedly sustainable level of 120% of annual economic output. Ms. Lagarde begged to differ. "What we regard as critical…is that the Greek debt be sustainable. In our view, the appropriate timetable is 120% by 2020," she said. That way, the country would get back on its feet and return to private debt markets quicker. Many experts are skeptical that Greece will be able to repay its debts under any of the current proposals. Although his country is resisting debt concessions, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble
admitted Tuesday that even making the claim that such a high debt load eight years down the line was sustainable for Greece posed "a certain challenge." The differences over the release of the next slice of Greek aid—which Mr. Schäuble said could be as much as €44 billion—provide insight into one of the most complicated aid programs in history. Not only must Greece deal with the demands of the IMF and other governments, but the European Central Bank also has a say, along with the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm. That makes finding compromise among the creditors enormously difficult, and to many of their arguments Greece is a mere spectator. One senior European official said any deal must meet three criteria that often conflict: the aim of governments to keep concessions to Greece to a minimum, the IMF's concern about its own credibility, and the desire to make the final agreement believable to financial markets. Some analysts doubt that the disagreements will hold up the next portion of aid, which should be formally agreed upon by finance ministers by the end of the month. That will go to a vote in as many as seven national parliaments, including Germany's, before it can be paid out, probably in December. However, the issue of Greece's heavy debt burden is unlikely to go away. Mujtaba Rahman,
an analyst at the Eurasia Group in New York, said the IMF efforts will pave the way for an assertive push for official debt relief next year. "The IMF is preparing the ground for the next conversation when the Greek problem resurfaces. They recognize there's no serious appetite for official creditor write-downs among euro-zone countries at this point," he said. Underneath all these technical discussions is a country awaiting aid. Greece avoided a default on its debt Tuesday when it successfully, and with the ECB's sanction, auctioned Treasury bills that will allow it to repay some maturing debts. Waiting for aid, the government has managed its finances by delaying payments to suppliers. According to a draft report from the commission, the Greek government's unpaid bills to suppliers totaled €8.3 billion at the end of September, up from €6.7 billion at the beginning of the year. Taxpayers are owed another €738 million in late refunds. Meanwhile, as the economy enters its sixth year of recession, the governing coalition in Athens has bled support in recent weeks as the Greek Parliament has passed measures, including more budget cuts, to secure the aid payment. That may be building up risks for next year. "The political necessity for creditors to get this program back on track is clear, but there is a trade-off. By leaning this hard on the government now, coalition stability is likely to be more tenuous throughout next year," Mr. Rahman said. —Gabriele Steinhauser and Matthew Dalton contributed to this article.

Stranger Than Paradise
Will the Philippine government's ambitious plan to attract luxury tourism threaten the environmental wonders that have made the country one of the last unspoiled tropical destinations in Asia? Two islands—one pristine, the other overpopulated—sound a cautionary note.

SEA WORTHY | A view of the Bacuit Bay archipelago, composed of 45 islands and located in the Philippine province of Palawan.
Photography by Simon Watson ASK THE AVERAGE WESTERNER what he knows about the Philippines and the reply will likely touch on Imelda Marcos's shoe collection, or Manny Pacquiao's knock-out record, or the Bataan Death March, or other things that don't necessarily scream "paradise." For this, I am grateful. Arcing down toward El Nido, 260 air miles southwest of Manila, I gaze upon spectrums of seawater rarely observed in nature—Scope mouthwash deepening to Edge Shave Gel—and, in my experience, never before observed without American accents and steel-drum tunes ringing in my ears. The breathless reports I've heard of Bacuit Bay's gob-stopping natural beauty seem, if anything, to have under-hyped the vista passing beneath the plane. Photos: The Philippines's Two Islands Diverged

Photography by Simon Watson Bacuit Bay, home to an archipelago of 45 islands bordering the South China Sea, occupies a place in the Filipino psychogeography like Alaska's in the American imagination: an unspoiled national Eden that few citizens ever get around to visiting. The bay sits at the northernmost tip of Palawan, the Philippines's most sparsely populated, westernmost province, which brands itself "the last frontier." The 19-seat turbo-prop charter to the bay's lone village, El Nido, is reportedly the most expensive domestic airfare in the Philippines. (An informal survey of my plane mates turns up zero Philippine passport holders and a predominance of Japanese and South Koreans.) But the view would seem to justify the ticket price: The bosky little ingots of land studding the bay seem to bear no trace of human settlement, and the blue-green tides are wholly unscarred by cruise ship or Jet Ski wakes. The bay's welcome lack of development is partly an effect of environmental progressivism (in 1998, the government declared northern Palawan a protected area) and partly an emblem of the country's late-blooming tourism industry. Public perceptions, shaped by headline-grabbing earthquakes, typhoons and periodic kidnappings—mostly by Muslim extremists around the contested southern island of Mindanao—have helped chill leisure travelers' enthusiasm for the island nation. And, until recently, its roadways, airports and hotels simply couldn't support large numbers of visitors accustomed to first-world amenities. But in the hopes of winning a wedge of a market long dominated by Thailand and Bali, the Philippines has committed unprecedented sums to its infrastructure budgets—$9.6 billion in 2013—and undertaken an ambitious media campaign to help assuage its image problem. The efforts appear to be bearing fruit. Fueled in part by the growing tourism industry, the nation's GDP swelled by 7.1 percent in the third quarter of last year, Asia's second-fastest growth rate, bested only by China. "There is no better time to be in the Philippines than now," says Robbie Antonio, managing director of Century Properties, a Manila real estate firm whose array of luxury construction projects includes Trump Tower, Makati City. "In our industry, demand for real estate has never been higher." In 2012, the Philippines received 4.3 million foreign visitors—more than twice its intake of travelers just a decade ago—inspiring a rash of media speculation that the nation's beach towns may soon go the way of Acapulco. In places like the Philippine island of Boracay, the transformation is well under way, so I head first to Bacuit Bay, to check out a diminishing rarity: a self-proclaimed tropical paradise that contains no go-kart tracks or daiquiri stands or much of anything but wild animals, water and sand. “
As I climb off the boat, a pair of long-tailed macaques, whom I assume are on the payroll, rove the cliff face, sampling white flowers.
”
If, like me, you are not categorically keen on Southeast Asian beach resorts, it is probably because you have been to Thailand's Phuket or Krabi, where you sat on heel-hammered sands drinking a warm gin and tonic from a literal bucket, wishing you'd discovered the place before the invention of fire-spinning, Katy Perry and laser shows. But the Lagen Island Resort, where I fetch up after a 40-minute boat cruise, is not that sort of place. Situated on a remote and otherwise deserted island distinguished by serous limestone cliffs, Lagen has 50 private rooms, including a crescent of eight hip-roofed cottages poised on stilts in an oval of placid water that's the color of molten Coke bottles. Admission to this world of ecofriendly ease—the resort has its own desalination and power plants, and wastewater-processing technology—does come at a comparative premium. Cabanas here range from $400 to $650 per night, a relative fortune in a land where clean and comfortable beachfront accommodations abound at a tenth or so the price. As I climb off the boat, a pair of long-tailed macaques, whom I assume are on the payroll, rove the cliff face, sampling white flowers. In the perfect absence of thundering house music, the call of a lone, coarse-throated bird thunders like a foghorn. Under the unwalled reception pagoda, frozen towels and glasses of gelid melon puree are put into our hands. We are gently instructed to set our mobile devices to vibrate for the duration of our stay. We are shown the beach, the slate-tiled saltwater pool and the al fresco cocktail shanty—phenomena my fellow travelers quietly moan over and photograph with reverent diligence. The temptation is strong to take to a lounger and lapse into basking-iguana consciousness. Instead, I submit to the activities director's recommendation to head out on a tour of Bacuit Bay's astonishments. My guide, a friendly and knowledgeable young man named Angelo Gustillo, ferries me across the bay to a small lagoon, known locally as "the small lagoon," which you get to by kayaking through a narrow fissure in a limestone breaker. Here, I swim through a canyon filled with green water of such violent luminosity that it's like breaststroking through a radioactive Midori cocktail. Green waverings play on the high gray stone. Plashings and gaspings of a sparse pack of astounded tourists echo off canyon walls. I suffer a vague despair that I am neither Brooke Shields nor 13 years old. Gustillo takes me snorkeling in a coral grove, going so far as to summon a crowd of gorgeous fish by chumming the water with hacked-up bits of less gorgeous ones. I see clown fish being gleefully tickled by anemones. I see schools of Day-Glo creatures that look like they were designed by Wes Anderson. I hear the snicky-snacky sound of coral breakfasting. He takes me spelunking through a Neolithic cave that is both prettier and tidier than my house. He brings me to the summit of a little mountain to take in a panorama of the bay and, with any luck, to spot some of Palawan's celebrity fauna: green sea turtles, dugongs, sharks, whale sharks and the world's most adorable ungulate, the Chihuahua-size Philippine mouse deer. At this point, I'm so surfeited on natural spectacles, it's faintly disappointing not to see a troupe of all these things executing Busby Berkeley maneuvers for my personal delectation. Among Palawan's deep trove of wildlife, the most precious to the local economy, Gustillo explains, is the swiftlet, a small darting bird whose nests, built largely of its own spittle, are the essential ingredient in bird's nest soup. A swiftlet nest (nido in Spanish, hence El Nido's name) sells for upward of 200 Philippine pesos per gram ($2,265 a pound). A few years back, Gustillo eked out a dangerous living retrieving the nests from crevices high in the cliff faces. "So many of my friends died doing that kind of work," he says, explaining that nido hunters disdain safety harnesses. "That's how it is with many Philippine people. They do what they have to live." But in the name of social and ecological responsibility, Lagen's resort manager tells me later, the El Nido Resorts have made a point of hiring nido hunters away from the cliffs and into careers less hazardous for the swiftlets and for the hunters themselves. LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, I return to Lagen Island. I laze around my handsome cabin. I laze some more on my private bayside veranda, gnawing a mango of life-altering excellence. I watch silvery small-fry dance and play across the water's surface. Then I reflect that they're not dancing and playing at all. A bigger fish is down there trying to murder them. But such is the weird, solipsistic derangement that starts to takes hold when you're in a place where the chief anxiety is the slowness with which the shadows grow on the shore-front chaises. When the light begins to fail, a staffer announces that the sun will soon be going down. My fellow guests and I get excited about the rotation of the planet as though it were an impromptu performance by Tom Jones. We board a sunset-watching vessel and stare at the big Clingstone peach in the western sky. The fiery lacuna the sun burns into my field of vision somehow feels like a valuable memento. Sumptuous though Lagen Island is, it seems a poor relation compared to Pangulasian, westward across the bay. After a fire razed the property a few years back, Pangulasian underwent a ground-up restoration, completed in October 2012. The result is a property nearly unsettling in its opulence. Accommodations at Pangulasian range from $800 per night for a beachfront cabana, to $3,300 per night for an eight-person suite of villas equipped with a private infinity pool. During my visit, the staff is still making refinements. One of these is a plan to query guests in advance as to their music and fragrance preferences, and moments before arrival, to flood the cabana with, for example, gardenia and Metallica. At sunset, I sit on a balcony with Pangulasian's manager, Lei Policarpio, dining on sea bass and foie gras–whipped potatoes, watching the sun perform. I mention to Policarpio my strange new understanding of the sun—Sol the product, Mister Tom Jones. She nods. "Yes, the sun is a product," noting that the island's east-west orientation treats the guest to two solar recitals per day. "The beach is a product, too." Then she frowns, looking down on the glowing strand. In her opinion, the product could be handsomer. Too many bits of shell and coral litter the sand. "You could have it sieved," I suggest unseriously. "We're going to try with rakes," but if the rakes don't do the trick, says Policarpio, she will have the beach sieved. IF BACUIT BAY FEELS like the Philippines's best-kept travel secret, its worst-kept secret is the island of Boracay, in the region of Visayas, a 40-minute flight south from Manila. Seen from above, such a profusion of windsurfers and parasails mob the limeade-tone shallows that the island looks besieged by moths. The flourlike beaches of Boracay, a narrow oddment of land a brief boat ride from the mainland town of Caticlan, have drawn throngs of foreigners since the '80s. Its years of hard use aren't difficult to detect. Not many acres of this 10-square mile island remain unclaimed by hotels or houses and golf courses. The few remaining postage-stamp size wildernesses are staked with "for sale" signs. Boracay's main attraction is the White Beach, a 2.5-mile stretch of bright sand along the island's west coast. When I first arrive, I have some difficulty finding it. The beach, as it turns out, is hiding behind a long bulwark of commercial establishments, including but not limited to: the Obama Grill (slogan: "You want good food? Yes we can!"); a shooters bar inviting patrons to accept its "still standing after 15 [shots]" challenge; the Facebook

Resort; a shopping mall; and an uncountable number of T-shirt vendors, massage touts and diving tour agencies. Visiting Boracay after Palawan admittedly subjects the place to an unfair comparison. Still, I'm pleased that Palawan's enviro-protected status has prevented people from erecting shooter bars on the hawksbill turtles' nesting beds. Shouldering through the White Beach's Times Square–density throngs, it's hard to greet happily those elements of tourist culture that have already dimmed the appeal of places like Phuket: pedicurists plucking at your sleeves; Russian tourists dancing Gangnam-style at a beachfront club; restaurants lit with so much neon they look like rides at the state fair; Wilford Brimley lookalikes dining wordlessly with young Filipinas whom one can only optimistically suppose are mail-order brides. According to press reports, the island is beginning to suffer serious ill-effects of its own popularity. The relentless foot traffic notwithstanding, hotels and seawalls built too close to the beach are contributing to the quickening erosion of Boracay's beaches. In recent years, boat anchors and heedless divers have helped kill off much of the surrounding hard coral. Leakage from below-code septic systems has been known to taint the beach sands. Among Boracay's service-sector workers, nervous rumors circulate that the environmental authorities plan to shutter the island for a season or two to let its ecosystem convalesce. Down by D Mall, the White Beach's retail epicenter, I pause to chat with boat tour operators Rene Plemones and Reynald Bernardo, who fret that the island and their livelihood may fall victim to its own success. "The development is a problem here in Boracay," Plemones says. "There are so many tourists, and so many hotels doing violations to the environment. How long will the tourists want to come here? We don't know." An official I queried at the Philippines Department of Tourism claimed not to have heard of any plans to close the island, but the rumor is regrettably familiar to Plemones and Bernardo. "Maybe it's going to happen," says Bernardo. But even a rest-cure isn't likely to restore Boracay to its former preeminence, he says. "Boracay used to be number one, but now number one is Palawan. It's the best island because of the nature. Boracay cannot be Palawan." Fair enough. But even here on Boracay, I ask, is there maybe someplace to, you know, dodge the tourists and get off the beaten track? Plemones muses, shakes his head. "I don't know about something like that." But, the White Beach is not devoid of appeal. And at mealtimes, it's well worth wending your way to the fish market, or talipapa, at the center of the labyrinthine D Mall. Here, for a modest sum, you can snag a fresh-caught fish or a still-gesticulating crab, which you then take to one of the half-dozen or so "cooking service" restaurants surrounding the market. A capable chef will flay and cook your catch to order. Eating your weight at the talipapa plaza is a wise thing to do. One afternoon, I ask my guide, a young man named Yeng, if he might help me track down some less tourist-friendly fare. He gives me an uncertain look. "Have you eaten balut?" Balut, for reasons that soon become clear, is a dish whose sale and consumption are forbidden on the White Beach. We head inland, and soon come across a plywood shelter full of local guys watching television, one of whom has a crate of it. “
Shouldering through the White Beach's Times Square—density throngs, it's hard to greet happily those elements of tourist culture that have already dimmed the appeal of places like Phuket.
”
Balut is an unborn duckling scalded in its shell, apparently, before hatching. By way of instruction, Yeng eats one first. He peels the shell, douses the occupant with vinegar and knocks it back, unchewed, like an oyster shot. My turn. A tittering mob gathers. I peel my egg and see a beak, an eye and some matted black down. Steady on, down the hatch. Okay, a couple of problems: First of all, the notion of swallowing something with such an obvious face does not inspire my throat to open for business; second, "duckling" seriously understates the creature's weight class. Lodged halfway down my gullet, the thing feels like a condor. A boa constrictor would have a hard time managing. About halfway past my tonsils, the bird makes a break for it and flies toward the light and into my palm. I give it an unceremonious burial behind the television shack. For the better part of a week, I will feel its ghost impression on my uvula, but it's hard to regret any experience that gives a dozen rubbernecking strangers the gift of helpless, tearful laughter. More From WSJ. Magazine Saving Myanmar's Priceless Architecture Dreaming in Ottoman: Istanbul at a Crossroads Ancient Village Rises in Shanghai My last full day on the island, I am still hung up on the idea of finding a spot less traveled by my fellow tourists. In my guidebook, I find mention of a local attraction that seems like it might be underattended: a bat cave near Ilig-Iligan Beach, on Boracay's less-populous eastern shore. Even Yeng has never ventured there, which seems a good sign. He arranges for us to double (or, more accurately, triple) helmetless on a stranger's wimpy-looking scooter. We rocket terrifyingly through traffic, swinging away from the hotel strip, through a simple village where the houses are sheet-metal shelters. The paving peters out, and the road dead-ends at a band of green ocean. Yeng and I climb through a fence of rusted barbed wire, down to a beach of brilliant white, thrillingly free of humanity. At the north end, Yeng finds a pair of barefoot kids in a cabin enclosed by a driftwood fence. They're maybe eight and ten years old, but they know about the bat cave and agree to take us there. They lead us up an eroded bank, past a couple of "No Trespassing" signs, through a dense patch of woods to a forbidding hole in the ground. It is dusk, and my plan is to hang around by the mouth of the cave until the bats burst forth in a huge photogenic plume, but the children go in. I follow, down and down over guano-slicked rocks, the descent getting scarier and less hygienic by the instant. I try to tell the kids that I've gone deep enough, that really, I'm just waiting for the bats to fly out, you know, to perform, like Mister Tom Jones. "No," one of the boys says. "What? They don't fly out at sunset? All bats fly out at sunset." "No," he says cryptically. The unseen bats are shrieking, evidently enraged at the intrusion. They howl and wheel but stay hidden in the dark. The light at the cave's mouth begins to fail. My guide is right. These creatures, who've presumably been here since before the arrival of the first tourist boat, have no intention of putting on a show. I respectfully withdraw, climbing up into the twilight, down to the empty beach, where I wash my hands in the sea. Explore More

The U.S. exports more aircraft and heavy equipment than it imports. Above, workers in Peoria, Ill., at a Komatsu plant that builds mining trucks.
Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal PEORIA, Ill.—Robert LeTourneau, a roving American evangelist and inventor, decided in the mid-1930s that a plot of lakefront land a mile and a half northeast of downtown Peoria would be a fine place to make earth-moving equipment. Skilled labor and suppliers were plentiful; transport links were good. Nearly eight decades later, Japan's Komatsu Ltd.

, which owns the plant, still thinks Mr. LeTourneau chose the right location—even though most giant mining trucks made there are shipped overseas to Latin America, Australia, Asia and Africa. The U.S. may not be much good at making small things like smartphones, but it is still a global leader in some of the biggest products, such as mining trucks as big as a two-story house and capable of hauling 400 tons of ore, James Hagerty reports on the News Hub.

makes its large mining trucks, most of which are exported. Caterpillar, No. 1 in this market, and No. 2 Komatsu account for roughly 85% of global sales of these trucks, roughly the size of two-story houses. Their presence has created a cluster of skills and suppliers that feeds the industry. At a time when politicians are hoping for a job-creating revival of American manufacturing, this is one area where U.S.-based plants are still global champions. Inside a dimly lit Komatsu building roughly the size of seven football fields, workers weld together the 30-ton frame of a mining truck. They choreograph their movements to avoid spraying each other with sparks or searing their eyes with blue light. "You almost have to make it a ballet," said Jim Mathis,
a general manager at the plant. Some workers have fathers and grandfathers who made trucks here. The U.S. had a deficit of $509.7 billion in trade in manufactured goods in this year's first nine months, largely due to gaping deficits in such major categories as consumer electronics and clothing. More Top U.S. Firms Are Cash-Rich Abroad, Cash-Poor at Home But in certain areas—notably aircraft, industrial engines, excavators and railway and mining equipment—the U.S. exports far more than it imports. These industries produce relatively small numbers of very expensive goods, requiring specialized technology and labor. Their competitive advantage rests partly on expertise built by U.S. companies in making durable, high-tech weaponry and other equipment for the military—frequently applicable to other products. "We have a very strong and very innovative military," said Cliff Waldman,
a senior economist at Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, an Arlington, Va., research organization. That creates an infrastructure for manufacturing and spurs innovation in such areas as metallurgy and engines. Determining where the U.S. can gain competitive edges is part of the challenge of creating more well-paid manufacturing jobs, a priority of the Obama administration, which is budgeting more money for research into manufacturing processes. Can the U.S. return to a surplus on manufacturing trade? "Probably not," said Mr. Waldman, "but I think we will do better." "We need to broaden our capabilities," said Gary Pisano,
a professor at Harvard Business School, who writes about global competition. He prescribes more training of engineers and high-skill manufacturing workers, a longer-term investment horizon for managers and government support for research in advanced materials, biotechnology and nanotechnology. Manufacturers benefit from clusters of suppliers and workers with specialized skills. Such clusters make Taiwan a powerhouse in semiconductors and China nearly unbeatable in smartphones and other consumer electronics.

Crane operators guide a 78-ton Komatsu mining-truck frame on the production line of the firm's Peoria plant.
Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal That local expertise attracted Komatsu. After being owned by Mr. LeTourneau, Westinghouse Electric and Dresser Industries, the Peoria plant was sold to Komatsu about two decades ago as part of the Japanese company's effort to establish a major American presence. Komatsu makes smaller mining trucks in Japan, but its largest trucks, able to carry as much as 360 tons of ore, come from Peoria. Given decades of investment in skilled labor and nearby suppliers, "it's not so easy just to pick it up and start somewhere else," said Rod Schrader,
CEO of Komatsu's U.S. arm. Global demand for large mining trucks is too small to justify more than one plant. The global market for large mining trucks, those that can carry 200 tons or more, is likely to reach about 1,900 to 2,000 vehicles this year, up from 1,591 in 2011, said Peter Gilewicz,
managing director of Parker Bay Co., a mining industry research firm. The trucks typically sell for $2.5 million to $6 million each, executives say. More than 90% are built at North American plants owned by Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.
