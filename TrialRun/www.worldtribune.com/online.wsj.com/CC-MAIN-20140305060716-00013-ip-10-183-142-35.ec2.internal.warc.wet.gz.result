--Comex March copper ends down 0.2% at $3.6765/lb --Copper slips as investors eschew assets vulnerable to shifts in economic outlook --Better economic data gives copper futures a fleeting bout of support By Tatyana Shumsky NEW YORK--Copper prices settled lower Thursday, after wading in and out of negative territory, as investors weighed better economic data against a general preponderance for avoiding risk. The most actively traded contract, for March delivery, fell 0.80 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $3.6765 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Copper is a key raw material for making a plethora of everyday goods from cars and phones to household plumbing, and investors view the industrial metal as a proxy for economic health. This risky profile makes copper vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment, such as when investors opt to seek safeharbor from economic uncertainty. The industrial metal oscilated around unchanged for much of the trading session as investors wavered between cheering brighter economic data and worrying about the outlook for global growth. "Copper has two forces pulling on it," said Bob Haberkorn, a senior commodities broker with RJO Futures. Copper prices had drawn support from data showing U.S. jobless claims fell to a five-year low of 330,000 last week, beating forecasts of 360,000 new applications. A Conference Board report showing its index of leading economic indicators increased in December, a sign suggesting better growth ahead, also gave the industrial metal some support. However, copper's gains were fleeting as risk aversion dominated Thursday's trading. Overnight, a preliminary reading of the HSBC China Manufacturing Purcahsing Managers' index showed activity in the sector rose to a 24-month high of 51.9 from a final reading of 51.5 in December. China is the world's largest copper consumer, and investors closely follow its manufacturing data for clues about future demand for the metal. "The fact that metal prices fell in the wake of the data was interesting, highlighting the lack of enthusiasm in the market at the moment," said Leon Westgate, base metals strategist with Standard Bank, in a note to clients. 
 
Copper settlements (ranges include electronic and pit trading): 
Mar $3.6765; down 0.80 cents; Range $3.6610-$3.6965 
May $3.6905; down 0.80 cents; Range $3.6750-$3.7100

'President Owns It'
By
David Feith
Updated Sept. 7, 2012 4:07 p.m. ET
We're witnessing several political traditions these days: ballyhooed party conventions, hyperbolic speeches to the faithful and now a rush to read Bob Woodward's latest book and deploy choice bits for political gain. The book isn't on sale until Tuesday, but as always copies have leaked all over Washington. "The Price of Politics" deals in predictably gossipy fashion with the economic policymaking of President Obama and his friends and adversaries on Capitol Hill. Here Mr. Obama is "spewing coals" at...

"We're doing our best to save what we've got and keep going," Neil Caplan, founder and executive director of the Bannerman Castle Trust, said...
