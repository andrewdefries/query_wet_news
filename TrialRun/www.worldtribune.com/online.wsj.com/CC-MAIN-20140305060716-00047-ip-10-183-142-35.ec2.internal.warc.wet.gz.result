Carter's induction into hall concludes festivities

Associated Press
CANTON, Ohio — Forcefully and emotionally, Cris Carter summed up the 50th induction ceremony for the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday night.
The seventh and final inductee from the Class of 2013, Carter honored dozens of people in his life who were "going into the Hall of Fame with me tonight," as he followed Jonathan Ogden, Dave Robinson, Larry Allen, Bill Parcells, Curley Culp and Warren Sapp in being inducted.
More than 120 hall members, a record, and a crowd of 11,500 was on hand at Fawcett Stadium for the golden anniversary celebration of the shrine.
"I appreciate the process you have to go through to get to be a Hall of Famer," Carter said. "To be able to join these men on this stage in football heaven is the greatest day of my life."
Carter needed six tries to make the hall even though he retired as the No. 2 career receiver behind Jerry Rice. He choked back tears as he made his speech after being presented by his son, Duron, and he spoke of his problems with alcohol while playing three years for the Eagles before being released.
He hooked on immediately with the Vikings and hooked onto nearly everything throw his way: Carter finished his 16-season career with 1,101 catches for 13,899 yards and 130 touchdowns.
"This game gave me identity, gave me a sense of purpose," he said.
Parcells also seemingly spoke for everyone in the Hall of Fame, and all the people gathered Saturday night.
"There's a kinship created that lasts for the rest of your life," he said about his experience as one of the NFL's most successful coaches.
The master of the franchise turnaround as the only coach to take four teams to the playoffs, Parcells won Super Bowls with the New York Giants in the 1986 and 1990 seasons.
"Every organization I worked for supported me to the fullest," Parcells said. "Without that, you've got no shot."
Parcells was Coach of the Year honors in 1986 and 1994. He asked to have his bust placed somewhere near Lawrence Taylor in the hall "so I can keep an eye on that sucker."
As relaxed as if he had no one to block, Ogden became the first Baltimore Raven enshrined. The first player drafted by the Ravens after the franchise moved from Cleveland in 1996 and was renamed, Ogden was presented by the man who made that selection, fellow Hall of Famer Ozzie Newsome, now Baltimore's general manager.
A former college shot putter at UCLA, the 6-foot-9, 345-pound Ogden starred at tackle for a dozen seasons in Baltimore, winning the 2000 NFL championship.
"He is part of the foundation of this franchise, part of the reason we have two Super Bowl championships," Newsome said.
Ogden, who was given a 2013 Super Bowl ring by the team, made the hall in his first year of eligibility. He was a six-time All-Pro, made the Pro Bowl 11 times and was the main blocker when Jamal Lewis rushed for 2,066 yards in 2003.
"Talent isn't enough," Ogden said. "A lot of people have talent, they don't always live up to it. For me it is about maximizing, striving for perfection."
Allen, who sniffled his way through his speech, was just as dominating a blocker as Ogden. He also was the NFL's strongest man, once bench-pressing 700 pounds, saying "I did it naturally."
A lead blocker for Dallas as Emmitt Smith became the NFL's career rushing leader, Allen made six All-Pro squads and 11 Pro Bowls in his 14 seasons, the final two with San Francisco. He won the Super Bowl in the 1995 season and was voted into the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility,
"I just knew I had to win every play," he said. "That's the reason I am here. I knew if I lost a play, I had 45 seconds to get even."
Sapp became only the second Tampa Bay Buccaneer enshrined, 18 years after Lee Roy Selmon made it. He was elected in his first year of eligibility following 13 seasons in which he went from instant starter after being selected 12th overall in the 1995 draft to Defensive Player of the Year in 1999. That season, he had 12 1/2 sacks as the Bucs won their first division title in 18 years. For his career, Sapp had 96 1/2 sacks, extremely high for a defensive tackle.
"I sit here with the greatest among the great," Sapp said, breaking into tears. "We're here, baby."
Presented Saturday night by his 15-year-old daughter, Mercedes, Sapp made the NFL's All-Decade squads for the 1990s and the 2000s.
Sapp, who both Ogden and Allen said was as tough to handle as any player they faced, paid tribute to his roots in Plymouth, Fla.
"That dirt road was something rough," he said. "We sure turned it into something special."
Robinson became the 12th inductee from the vintage Packers coached by Vince Lombardi to be enshrined. Robinson was a prototype outside linebacker who could rush the quarterback, cover tight ends or running backs on pass plays, and stop the run. He made the NFL's All-Decade team of the 1960s and won three NFL titles, including the first two Super Bowls.
"This is the biggest day of the 21st century for the Robinson family," he said, adding that he "lives 25 miles from here but it took me 38 years to get here.
"Now, I am immortalized."
As is Culp, one of the game's most dominant defensive tackles for much of his 14 pro seasons, including the 1969 season when he helped Kansas City win the NFL title.
A five-time Pro Bowler, Culp also played for Houston and Detroit, retiring in 1981, then waiting more than three decades to be enshrined Saturday as a senior nominee.
"It gives me joy and inspiration that will last the rest of my life," Culp said. "I am just overwhelmed by the struggles, joys and tears of those who made it here. I'm happy to join them in the Hall of Fame.

Eike Batista modera sus ambiciones en medio de dudas sobre sus metas

Por LUCIANA MAGALHÃES, PAULO WINTERSTEIN e MATTHEW COWLEY SÃO PAULO—El extravagante magnate brasileño Eike Batista levantó un imperio desde cero, recaudando miles de millones de dólares a través de ofertas de acciones y acumulando deuda, a medida que la mayor economía de América Latina se expandía rápidamente.
Pero en los últimos nueve meses, tras perder dos terceras partes de su fortuna, la ambición de Batista de convertirse en el hombre más rico del mundo ha quedado en suspenso. Y como consecuencia, su credibilidad ahora está en entredicho. Enlarge ImageClose
Bloomberg
Los últimos meses han puesto en entredicho la credibilidad de Eike Batista.
Entre 2006 y 2010, Batista recaudó miles de millones de dólares para financiar nuevas compañías en industrias intensivas en capital como la minera, la petrolera y la portuaria, ya que sus ideas apelaban a una nación que necesitaba infraestructura. Sólo en 2011 y 2012, su holding EBX Group invirtió un total de US$15.700 millones.
Sin embargo, ahora crecen las dudas sobre la capacidad de Batista para cumplir con sus ambiciosas metas para terminar enormes proyectos. Las pérdidas combinadas de sus empresas se más que duplicaron en 2012, a US$1.250 millones, calcula la consultora Economática.
Para demostrar que sus detractores están equivocados y asegurar la viabilidad a largo plazo de su imperio, Batista está buscando nuevos socios y financiación adicional, a veces vendiendo participaciones. Recientemente, el empresario defendió su conglomerado en Twitter diciendo que la gente que apostaba en su contra "se vería sorprendida con los pantalones bajados".
La semana pasada, Batista anunció la venta de casi la mitad de su participación de 53,9% en la compañía eléctrica MPX Energia SA a la alemana E.ON SE, que ya tenía 10% de MPX. El acuerdo, valorado en al menos US$700 millones, podría ser el primero en una serie de operaciones del empresario para tratar de restaurar la confianza en su conglomerado, aseguran fuentes cercanas.En una reciente llamada de resultados financieros, Roberto Monteiro, el director financiero de OGX Petróleo e Gás Participações SA, la empresa insignia de Batista, reconoció que están explorando "alternativas" por si deciden recaudar capital para poder participar en una subasta de licencias de exploración de petróleo en Brasil. Una opción sería vender participaciones en algunos de los bloques de exploración y yacimientos petroleros existentes de la compañía, señaló Monteiro. "Aún tenemos varias opciones abiertas", añadió.
En marzo, Batista firmó una alianza estratégica con André Esteves, que dirige el banco de inversión Banco BTG Pactual SA, asegurándose así tanto una línea de crédito de US$1.000 millones como su apoyo gerencial, conforme EBX Group emprende un nuevo rumbo.Esteves declinó ofrecer comentarios pero, en una entrevista con el periódico brasileño O Estado de São Paulo, dijo que el problema no es la deuda de EBX sino la necesidad de financiar futuras inversiones y esto tiene que resolverse proyecto por proyecto. Batista ha sumado socios a sus proyectos, aunque hasta ahora estas alianzas han sido relativamente limitadas, como una inversión de US$300 millones en mayo de 2012 en EBX por parte de General Electric Co. Lo que se vislumbra ahora es algo mucho más extenso.A mediados de junio de 2012, se desencadenó una crisis de credibilidad cuando OGX decepcionó a los inversionistas con una producción en sus primeros pozos mucho menor a la prevista. Debido a los fuertes vínculos entre las empresas que componen el conglomerado EBX Group, ese problema tiene un impacto generalizado: la filial de astilleros, OSX Brasil SA, producirá plataformas petroleras para OGX, mientras que OSX está ubicada dentro del complejo del puerto Açu que está siendo construido por LLX Logística SA (Lea más sobre este proyecto en esta página).Hijo de Eliezer Batista da Silva, ex ministro de Minería y ex presidente del gigante minero Vale SA, Batista llegó a ser el séptimo empresario más rico del mundo; con frecuencia alardeaba de que conquistaría la corona. Su patrimonio neto pasó de US$7.500 millones en 2009 a US$30.000 millones en 2011. Pero para marzo de este año, se había encogido a US$10.600 millones, colocándolo en el puesto 100, según el ranking de la revista Forbes.Seis de las compañías principales de EBX Group cotizan en bolsa. Conforme la confianza ha ido menguando, las acciones han empezado a tambalearse. Ahora, el grupo cuenta con entre 60% y 70% de las acciones en sus filiales. Con el acuerdo de la semana pasada, la participación en MPX se reducirá a aproximadamente 24%.
Los detractores del magnate argumentan que sus firmas quizás prometieron de más, tal como sugieren los problemas de producción en OGX. Aseguran que las empresas se han vuelto demasiado dependientes de los mercados de capital. Las acciones de OGX acumulan una caída de 46% desde comienzos del año. El grupo debe más de 10.000 millones de reales (US$4.950 millones) a algunos de los mayores bancos de Brasil, incluyendo Banco Itaú Unibanco SA, Banco Bradesco SA y Banco BTG Pactual SA, según tres banqueros.

DUBAI—Dubai Aerospace Enterprise was one of the major casualties when the global financial crisis hit the desert emirate in 2009. Now it is aiming to get customers back on board. On Wednesday, DAE ordered 40 new aircraft worth an estimated $988 million from ATR—its first major deal since a debt-restructuring process effectively grounded its operations. The leasing company, which is majority owned by the government of Dubai, announced...

Hillary's Vaccine Shortage
Updated Aug. 15, 2003 12:01 a.m. ET
Everyone knows America's vaccine industry is in serious trouble, with an ever dwindling number of producers and recent severe vaccine shortages. What everyone also should know is that the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine has now pinned much of the blame on Hillary Rodham Clinton. Well, not in so many words. The panel of doctors and economists issuing a report on vaccines last week was too polite to mention the former First Lady by name. But they identify as a fundamental cause of the problem the fact...
