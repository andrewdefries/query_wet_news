Updated Oct. 4, 2009 6:56 p.m. ET
A year ago our country was in the midst of a serious crisis, with large financial institutions teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. There was a very real danger credit markets would freeze and the economy would grind to a halt. Faced with that threat, Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to help stabilize the economy. Originally designed and proposed as a straightforward measure to help failing banks get toxic assets off their books while they regained their financial footing, TARP was subsequently used by the Treasury Department to acquire extensive ownership interests in private businesses. Our financial markets are no longer in free fall and the crisis has receded. Yet we now find ourselves in a troubling situation where the federal government is a major owner of more than 600 U.S. financial institutions and banks, as well as two auto makers, an international insurance conglomerate, and numerous other businesses. President Obama has become the de facto CEO of large chunks of our economy, with the power to hire and fire executives, dictate salaries, declare what products should be made, and decide winners and losers in the marketplace. The inherent conflicts of interest are enormous and should be a concern to all Americans. It is time to bring an end to the TARP emergency measures and come up with an exit strategy to get government out of the business of running businesses. The administration owes the American people a timeline for how it will do this. The Treasury secretary has the authority to either allow the program to expire at the end of this year or extend it into next fall. Ending TARP this year is a vital first step to getting the federal government out of these expensive and risky entanglements in private industry. Shutting down TARP would also ensure we don't risk losing more taxpayer dollars. The latest report by the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel found that approximately $330 billion of the $700 billion limit is currently untapped. Allowing TARP to end this year and cancelling that remaining $330 billion would remove the inevitable temptation to spend it. With a budget shortfall expected to hit a record $1.6 trillion this year and a staggering $9 trillion over the next 10 years, we should be looking for every possible way to reduce the risk we are taking on behalf of taxpayers. Once the administration has allowed the TARP authority to expire, it should lay out a plan to sell its stake in these private companies. The plan should allow some flexibility so the Treasury can divest these assets prudently. But there needs to be an aggressive timeline so that we can get out of these businesses as soon as possible. Without a date certain, the government's unprecedented entanglement in the private sector could drag on for years with more vague reassurances from the Treasury department that things will change "soon." If the administration cannot come up with a plan on its own, then Congress has a responsibility to act. To that end I've introduced the Government Ownership Exit Plan, which would ensure that the federal government sells its ownership stake within a reasonable time frame. Whether we move forward under a plan developed by the administration or the legislative framework I've introduced is not important. It simply needs to be done. We also need to ensure that any TARP funds recouped from the sale of assets are dedicated to deficit reduction, not more spending or more government takeovers. TARP was created in response to a very specific—and temporary—financial emergency. It was never intended to become a $700 billion slush fund for whatever business experiment the administration sets its eyes on. This dangerous mixture of politics and industry is bad for business, bad for the economy, and bad for the American taxpayer. TARP has run its course. The time for ending it is now. Mr. Thune is a Republican senator from South Dakota. Email

NEW DELHI--India is likely to get normal monsoon rains this year, which will bring relief to large swathes of the country gripped by drought, a top weather official said Monday. "So far, there is no worry signal," said D. Sivananda Pai,
head of long-range monsoon forecasting at India's Meteorological Department. The department is due to release its official forecast for this year's monsoon after April 10. The news is significant for the overall economy as more than half of India's workforce is employed in agriculture and is critical for the country's food security as 60% of farmlands are rain-dependent. Monsoon rain levels will also have an impact on both the import and export of foodstuffs. Enlarge Image
A farmer plowing a field on the outskirts of Siliguri, West Bengal, July 2007. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images There is no threat from El Nino, an abnormal warming of surface ocean waters which disrupted even distribution of last year's monsoon rainfall, the official told The Wall Street Journal. Last year, India received below-normal rain in the first half of the June-September monsoon season, and while it picked up in some areas from late August, large parts of west and south India didn't benefit. "It is a bit early to say for sure, but the indication given by the weather department is certainly a positive," said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist with CARE rating agency. Expectations of 6% economic growth in the financial year that began April 1 depend on having a normal monsoon, he said. India's economy is estimated to have grown by around 5% in the year ended March 31, 2013, the statistics ministry says. "A good monsoon will also be deflationary," Mr. Sabnavis said, noting that prices of food items depend not just on a good harvest, but also on farm input costs and whether the government increases assured prices of food staples. India's government usually increases assured prices paid to farmers each year for key staples such as wheat, rice and lentils, aiming to support their incomes and ensure that they don't switch to other less important crops. The wholesale price index, the main gauge of inflation in India, dipped below 7% for the first time in three years in January, and stayed below that mark in February. However, food inflation has been hovering close to double digits for over two years, driving up overall inflation and crimping the space the central bank has to cut lending rates to stimulate economic growth. In February, the food inflation rate was 11.4%, year-on-year. Another economist, Sujan Hajra,
chief economist of Anand Rathi Securities, said that a clear idea of the monsoon was possible only in June-July, noting that early forecasts quite often are inaccurate. This year's rain levels will be particularly critical given the drought in the western state of Maharashtra and the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra is India's largest sugar producing state and Andhra Pradesh is the top rice producer. Email

SITTING ON A DAPPLED TERRACE sipping a Fernet Branca and admiring a glimmering river view is nice enough. Tooling around in a swan-shaped pedal boat can be a giggle. But incessant pleasantness gets dreary. Sometimes you feel like dressing all in black, heading to the type of club your mother has never been to and is still afraid of, and descending some pockmarked staircase into Stygian depths where fierce guitars, tattooed women and wanton chaos reign. Yes, for all its delicious regional wines and cheeses, for all its ingenious, blippy electro beats, Europe still needs rock bars. And thankfully it has some really, really good ones. If you're ready to kick out the jams, try one of these places. Enlarge Image
Mario Duhanic 8mm, Berlin A small, dark, smoky dive bar lit by candles, red bulbs and films projected onto the back wall, 8mm is especially popular with touring American musicians—the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio and the Kills have all hung out there. DJs play fundamentals like the Stooges, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Sonic Youth. Every couple of months, live shows next door showcase underground Berlin rock bands on associated label 8mm Musik, plus psych-rock group Brian Jonestown
Massacre, whose lead singer, Anton Newcombe,
lives upstairs and records nearby. Bar manager Peter Mangan
(guitarist in Sun and the Wolf) says on weekdays the bar fills up with artists, filmmakers and musicians—people who are interesting to talk to. Weekends, he says, "can be pretty wild and also like a cool party: There's no official closing time, so anything can happen." Drink: Melloch (in-house schnapps, €2) Schönhauser Allee 177, 10119 Berlin; 8mmbar.com Enlarge Image
Jérémie Spada Jackets, Paris A classic rock club on the edge of the well-heeled Marais district, Jackets only opened in May, but the bathroom walls have already been decorated with some choice French swear words. A black-clad space with black leather couches and flight cases for tables, it feels like a backstage area or the lounge room of a recording studio. Co-owner Andrew Woodhead,
who plays in Dancing Doors and Singtank, says DJs are allowed to play whatever they like so long as it's rock 'n' roll. Drink: A pint of Peroni (€6) and a shot of Jameson's (€4) 20 rue de Picardie, 75003 Enlarge Image
Jamie McNeil Nice 'n' Sleazy, Glasgow Open since 1991 and with an unfakeable rough-and-ready vibe, Sleazy's pulls in a lot of students from the nearby art school, making it great for people-watching. They program a good deal of live music, too—if you picked the right nights next week, for instance, you could see as many as 10 live acts, all for around £20. They're particularly strong on experimental sounds. Musicians from Glasgow bands like Franz Ferdinand,
Arab Strap and Mogwai hang out here, but music programmer Fielding Hope says it's not an elitist environment. "I guess it's quite punkish in a way," he says. "It's grungy enough to feel accessible." With a license to stay open until 3 a.m. every night, it's also a reliable final destination. Drink: A Buckaroo (a Buckfast cocktail, £3.70) or a White Russian (£3) 421 Sauchiehall St, G2 3LG; nicensleazy.com Enlarge Image
Debaser Debaser, Stockholm Named after the Pixies song, Debaser is about as grimy as Stockholm gets, located under a bridge, but with an outdoor bar and restaurant. Upcoming local bands play mainly indie rock and experimental pop here—you can listen to staff picks on Debaser's curated music-sharing site and app ( mydebaser.se )—but harder acts like Black Lips and M83 have also appeared, and Suicidal Tendencies play later this month. This is likely to be Debaser's last summer; it's slated to close in September to make way for a major civic redevelopment. Ten thousand people have signed a petition seeking a stay of execution but The Man doesn't seem to care about rock fans. Drink: A strawberry daiquiri (135 kronor, or around €15.50) Karl Johans
Torg 1, 111 30; debaser.se Enlarge Image
James Burgess The Shacklewell Arms, London In a former St. Lucian dance hall pub (and with the original murals left intact), the Shacklewell Arms is vaguely trendy—
Solange Knowles
and Jamie xx
have played DJ sets—but rock bands play there most weeks, and these tend to be some of the best breaking acts: Savages, DIIV and Django Django
have all played pivotal shows. The programming team includes the people behind indie music festival Field Day, where the Shacklewell Arms has a stage. Next door to the pub is Lighthouse Studios, so local musicians like the Horrors and Veronica Falls
