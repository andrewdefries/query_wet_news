Exportadores do Japão se adaptam à vida com iene forte

Por CHESTER DAWSON, de Iida, JapãoA valorização de 34% do iene em relação ao dólar nos últimos cinco anos foi um golpe para a famosa máquina de exportação japonesa. A moeda forte precipitou uma onda de transferências de produção para outros países que ajudou a criar os déficits na balança comercial japonesa, antes impensáveis. Ainda assim, um grupo audacioso de empresas dependentes de exportações conseguiu não só sobreviver, mas também prosperar no caos cambial que geralmente leva a culpa pelos problemas do Japão.
Um exemplo é a Tamagawa Seiki Co., empresa de 74 anos de existência cuja sede fica numa estradinha aninhada em meio a pomares de maçãs fuji, nas encostas dos Alpes do sul do país. A fabricante, um importante elo na combalida cadeia de suprimentos do Japão, está ampliando constantemente sua plataforma de produção no próprio Japão, em vez de se voltar para o exterior.

Chester Dawson/The Wall Street Journal
Norifumi Hagimoto, o presidente da Tamagawa Seiki Co.
Seu segredo para vencer a subida do iene são os giroscópios e sensores de última geração, usados desde em carros híbridos até aviões de caça e satélites, e que não têm substitutos fáceis de se encontrar. Este ano a empresa está acrescentando linhas de montagem em três fábricas no Japão para aumentar em 15% sua produção de sensores de carros híbridos, para 10 milhões de unidades por ano.
"Nossos concorrentes diretos nos Estados Unidos desapareceram um por um devido a fusões, criando grandes fornecedores de sistemas que perderam o interesse em fabricar peças individuais. O resultado é que os técnicos foram demitidos e a tecnologia se atrofiou", disse ao The Wall Street Journal o presidente da empresa, Norifumi Hagimoto. "Não precisamos ter fábricas no exterior para sermos uma empresa global", disse ele.
A Toyota Motor Corp. é, de longe, a maior cliente da Tamagawa, mas a empresa informa que também fornece para a General Motors Co. e a Volkswagen AG, e goza de um quase monopólio na cadeia de suprimentos automotivos em um produto chamado sensor de rotação e ângulo, usado para alternar do motor a gasolina para o elétrico de maneira suave e silenciosa.A Tamagawa informa que entre seus outros clientes estão a taiwanesa Foxconn Technology Group
., uma contratada da Apple Inc. que também fornece peças para robôs industriais e para as gigantes aeroespaciais Airbus SAS e Boeing Co., peças essas usadas em aplicações como sistemas de piloto automático.A Tamagawa não é a única. Outras pequenas exportadoras japonesas que estão prosperando apesar do iene forte incluem a Okano Kogyo Co., de Tóquio, que fabrica minúsculas agulhas hipodérmicas (de apenas 0,2 milímetros de espessura); a Mikuro Spring Co., da província de Nagano, que tem 70% de participação no mercado global de molas de ponta arredondada para canetas esferográficas; a Yamaju Ceramics Co., da província de Aichi, dona de 30% do mercado mundial de wafers monocristalinos, que transmitem o som nos telefones celulares; e a Meisei Industry Co., da província de Gunma, que detém um terço do mercado global de fios elétricos de baixa voltagem usados para transmitir eletricidade nos aparelhos domésticos.
Enquanto 60% das pequenas e médias empresas exportadoras foram afetadas negativamente pela valorização do iene em 2011, segundo uma pesquisa citada num relatório recente do Ministério do Comércio do Japão, outras 40% afirmam que as alterações cambiais não tiveram nenhum impacto, ou foram até mesmo positivas.
Essa resistência ilustra por que os fabricantes japoneses de elite, embora prejudicados, continuam a ser uma força considerável na arena global — e estão aptos a colher lucros gordos se o iene continuar recuando das suas altas recordes em relação ao dólar e outras moedas. "Esses fabricantes de nicho têm um domínio quase invencível sobre o mercado dos seus produtos, por mais que o iene se valorize", disse Takashi Masuda, economista-chefe do centro de estudos japonês Toray Corporate Business Research Inc.
A Tamagawa cita sua capacidade tecnológica e sua base de clientes fiéis como os motivos que lhe permitiram continuar ancorada no Japão. Essa firma de capital fechado não divulga lucros, mas no ano passado as vendas ultrapassaram 32,6 bilhões de ienes (US$ 395 milhões) — o segundo ano seguido de crescimento após ter caído, devido à recessão, para 24,2 bilhões de ienes em 2009.
Em um momento em que as montadoras mundiais amargam prejuízos na Europa por causa da persistente recessão e da rápida desvalorização do euro, a Tamagawa abriu seu primeiro escritório de vendas na Alemanha em julho, com seis funcionários em tempo integral. Hagimoto espera que as exportações para a Europa, que no ano passado chegaram a 4 bilhões de ienes, dobrem nos próximos cinco anos.
No ano passado, a pedido de clientes que têm atividades na China, a Tamagawa abriu uma fábrica lá, sua primeira no exterior, para produzir subcomponentes utilizados em robôs industriais, principalmente codificadores e servomotores. Mas isso representa apenas uma fração das suas vendas.
A empresa fornece o equipamento usado para posicionar as barras de combustível em todas as usinas nucleares japonesas, assim como a maioria das peças usadas no braço robótico da Estação Espacial Internacional e sensores críticos do jipe-robô Curiosity, da Nasa, que pousou em Marte em agosto. Os contratos militares representam cerca de 20% das vendas de Tamagawa, sobretudo giroscópios avançados para os modernos aviões e mísseis japoneses.
Na outra ponta do espectro, a empresa foi atraída para a produção em massa de peças automotivas. No espaço de dez anos, o negócio evoluiu de uma pequena divisão até constituir 35% do total de vendas da Tamagawa, perdendo apenas para as peças usadas em automação industrial.
A tecnologia surgiu de um pedido da Toyota antes do lançamento, em 1997, do seu Prius híbrido de primeira geração. A montadora precisava de uma engrenagem mecânica capaz de calibrar a passagem de motor a gasolina para motor elétrico.
A Toyota pediu então aos fornecedores que aumentassem muito sua capacidade para atender ao aumento previsto na demanda global pelo Prius da geração seguinte, de 2003. Mas a montadora ficou frustrada pela intransigência da Tamagawa, que não queria abandonar sua tradição de produção em pequenos lotes.
"Estávamos batendo a cabeça na parede tentando convencê-los a aumentar a produção", disse um alto executivo da Toyota.
Hagimoto disse que sua empresa se sentiu sobrecarregada com essa encomenda e insegura quanto a poder se adaptar para atender à escala necessária e ao mesmo tempo conservar sua qualidade. "Nós hesitamos em dar esse mergulho", disse Hagimoto. "Mas, no fim, percebemos que, se não fizéssemos isso, outra empresa o faria. E até agora não nos arrependemos."

The Giacomettis, Switzerland's most famous family of artists, will feature at a Christie's auction of Swiss art on Monday, coinciding with a major Giacometti exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zurich. Painters Giovanni Giacometti (1868-1933) and his cousin Augusto Giacometti (1877-1947) were wonderful colorists. Giovanni was the father of star sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966), renowned sculptor-designer Diego Giacometti (1902-1985) and prominent architect Bruno Giacometti, who died this year at the age of 104. Bruno bequeathed more than 250 works by Giovanni and Alberto to the Kunsthaus Zurich and they are on display there until Feb. 17, alongside sculpture and paintings from the Alberto Giacometti Foundation. The Zurich art museum houses the world's most important collection of Alberto's work. Augusto Giacometti's 'Self Portrait' (1909) may fetch 200,000-300,000 francs.
Christie's Images The Giacomettis were from the remote mountain valley of Bregaglia in Italian-speaking Switzerland, a magical place where the tall trees remind me of Alberto's famous elongated sculptures. The donation from Bruno's estate gives a personal glimpse of life at the Giacomettis. There are Giovanni's paintings of his children; Alberto's images of his mother Annetta, a loved matriarch; and views of the surrounding countryside. In Christie's auction of Swiss art will be 35 lots from Bruno's estate that are being sold to benefit the Dr. Beat Richner Foundation Kantha Bopha Children's Hospitals in Cambodia. Items include furniture, objects and memorabilia with which Bruno lived. Diego's sculpted bronze tables, chairs and lamps lead the furniture section. An oval bronze and glass table decorated with an owl is expected to fetch 150,000-200,000 Swiss francs (€123,639-€164,852); a bronze stool reminiscent of ancient times, 50,000-70,000 francs; and a bronze lamp, 25,000-35,000 francs. Diego was happy to live in the shadow of his brother Alberto, always willing to sit for long hours as a model for his brother's sculptures. Today, however, his importance as a sculptor of furniture is increasingly recognized. Memorabilia includes a leather suitcase covered in travel stickers and with Alberto's name tag (estimate: 4,000-6,000 francs). Alberto carried the case on his last journey home to Switzerland from Paris in 1966, where he died in Chur, capital of the canton where he grew up. "Collectors look for memorabilia like this," said Hans-Peter Keller, who heads Christie's Swiss art department. Apart from Bruno's section, the 243-lot sale offers other Giacometti works. There is a superb example of Giovanni's gift as a colorist in "Fiammetta II," an extraordinary painting of a nude from 1909 where the figure emerges from a dramatic background of hot yellows and reds (estimate: 800,000-1.2 million francs). Less dramatic but charming Impressionist flower pictures show Augusto's colorist quality: "Orchids II" (1935) is estimated at 80,000-120,000 francs and "Carnations in a Glass Vase" (1932) at 200,000-250,000 francs. Augusto's "Self Portrait" (1909) is a colorist masterpiece, painting the artist's face and beard in brilliant yellow (estimate: 200,000- 300,000 francs). Giovanni included among his friends Ferdinand Hodler (1853-1918), one of the most collectible Swiss artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From Sept. 20 until Jan. 7, the Neue Galerie in New York will present the largest American exhibition ever devoted to Hodler's work. In Christie's Zurich sale will be Hodler's "Chestnut Trees at Biberist" (1898), an enchanting Swiss landscape depicting trees with falling leaves (estimate: 2.5 million-3.5 million francs). Another friend of Giovanni's was Cuno Amiet (1868-1961), whose colorful Swiss landscapes are gaining increasing international recognition. "Fruit Tree in Full Bloom in a Spring Landscape" (1905), a lovely green, blue, purple and pink painting, is expected to fetch 800,000-1.2 million francs in the sale.

2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek 2.01 Limited CVT
Dan Neil/The Wall Street Journal DID YOU KNOW that in an automotive market as huge and diverse as ours (around 14 million annual U.S. new-car sales), you could build a car that smelled of dead octopus and had square wheels and it'd still sell? It's a fact. Not a lot, sure. But a few. To somebody. Somewhere. Like those saints who go to the pound and adopt the ugliest dog on the lot—saints, I tell you!—there are cadres of the American car-buying public who will, rather mysteriously, buy the worst vehicles on the market, rather than the best. And yet, this is only probability distribution rearing its head. This is the weird end of the bell curve. Subaru of America calls this week's vehicle the XV Crosstrek 2.0i. In other markets it's known as the Impreza XV, named after the famous nerve gas. It's essentially an Impreza five-door hatchback, the Sport, with a lift kit, the body raised 3 inches to allow 8.7 inches of ground clearance. These extra inches are plainly visible in the distance between the top of the car's tires and the fender wells, a part of a car that designers call the "dead cat" space. Again, the message here is, spay and neuter. The Crosstrek has much to recommend it. It is a clear win aesthetically over the donor Impreza Sport—a low bar, to be sure—with dark composite lower-body cladding on the rocker panels, on the front and rear valences and around the wheel wells. From the color-coordinated roof rails and tinted window glass to the murdered-out alloy wheels, the Crosstrek has a nicely tough, bandy, unpaved look. This thing is missing kayaks on the roof like Venus de Milo misses arms. Its additional 3 inches of ground clearance could be useful, too, I suppose, but I recommend not challenging any car-based compact-ute to standing snow. And I wonder how many Subie shoppers, unmoved by the ruralized styling, will simply take the $1,500 price difference between the Impreza Sport and the Crosstrek, and divide by the additional ground clearance: $500 per inch. “
It's bellowing and torpid, but at least the Impreza-based ute has good looks and great mileage.
”
The Crosstrek is, says Subaru, the most fuel-efficient all-wheel-drive crossover on the market, with highway mileage of 33 miles per gallon. That test car must have been filled with helium, because I did not see anything like that kind of highway mileage. Still, the Crosstrek is thrifty. The Crosstrek also qualifies as a partial-zero emission vehicle (PZEV), as per California rules. 2013 Subaru Crosstrek: A Car Not For Me

Dan Neil/The Wall Street Journal The Crosstrek is therefore, and succinctly, a small, handsome soft-roader, with a great AWD pedigree from Subaru and best-in-class fuel economy. The Limited model ($24,495) I drove came with an all-weather package (heated front seats, wiper de-icer), HD radio, rear center armrest, auto climate control and a few other enticements. The test car's final tally ($27,290) also included $2,000 for the optional navigation and moon-roof package. Sounds nice, doesn't it? And it would be, except for the huge hole below the waterline in the form of the engine and transmission. The key to the Crosstrek's big fuel-economy numbers is the continuously variable transmission, what Subie calls the Lineartronic CVT. The advantage of CVTs is that, unlike conventional transmissions with stepped gears, a CVT tranny can match engine revs to throttle demand and speed more efficiently. With the five-speed manual tranny, the Crosstrek returns a rated 23/30 mpg, city/highway, as compared with 25/33 for the car with the CVT. The disadvantages of CVTs are twofold: One, the engines they are connected to often have to rev in long and unrelieved stretches to meet demands for acceleration. Compared with the crisp upshifts of a conventional automatic or manual transmission, a CVT can make a car sound unhappy, a sort of mournful bleating. CVTs oblige auto makers to work harder to muffle powertrain noise. Subaru doesn't seem to have done that work. Under hard throttle the Crosstrek sounds like somebody needs to call the large-animal veterinarian. The other pitfall for CVTs is that they tend to swallow horsepower and torque, neither of which the boxer four has in abundance (148 hp/145 pound-feet). Adding to the power/weight issue, the Crosstrek weighs 3,164 pounds—about 100 pounds more than the donor Impreza Sport. The Crosstrek's CVT has "sport" mode in its transmission programming, allowing drivers to select preset ratios that mimic those of a conventional six-speed gearbox. It even has paddle shifters, with which you can actually wind the thing out. 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek 2.0i Limited CVT
Subaru Base price: $21,995 Price as tested: $27,290 Powertrain: Naturally aspirated 2.0-liter DOHC, 16-valve flat-four with variable valve timing; continuously variable automatic transmission with manual shift mode; full-time all-wheel drive Horsepower/torque: 148 hp at 6,200 rpm/145 pound-feet at 4,200 rpm Length/weight: 175.2 inches/3,164 pounds Wheelbase: 103.7 inches 0-60 mph: 10 seconds (est.) EPA fuel economy: 25/33 mpg, city/highway Cargo capacity: 23 cubic feet
And yet the slowness is breathtaking, a torpid, complaining pace-gaining that is almost Skinnerian, with the bellowing a negative reinforcement punishing over-aggressive acceleration. Maybe that's the whole point. It might be that I'm peevish. It might be that some particular resonant frequency, some faint over-note in this dirging chorus, is unusually upsetting to just me. Or it might be that the Crosstrek is slow and noisy, as I initially suspected. And as long as I'm banishing myself from Subaru's good graces, let me just say the audio/navigation system that's plunked down in the center console is an affront to the good name Pep Boys. Subaru must do more to be competitive in the realm of cabin amenities and electronics. The Crosstrek looks great outside, has real ground clearance, serious AWD credibility and excellent fuel economy. The additional 3 inches of legginess doesn't seem to have adversely affected handling. The suspension does feel firmer than the Impreza's, in order to help quell body roll caused by a higher center of gravity. But the electric-assist steering response is crisp and affirmative. The chassis feels settled and predictable. Overall, it feels like it wants to go faster. And—who knows?—it might yet find an audience outside the natural distribution of Subie fanatics. But for me, I need more horsepower, rounder wheels and somewhat fewer octopi. Email Dan at rumbleseat@wsj.com Explore More
