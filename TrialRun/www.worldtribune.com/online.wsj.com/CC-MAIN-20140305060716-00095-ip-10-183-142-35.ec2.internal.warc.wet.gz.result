It isn't just hurricanes and floods that can knock out oil and gas production—in Texas, wintry wind and ice can do the trick. Bitter winds that blew sleet across Texas just before Thanksgiving led to power outages, frozen equipment and icy roads throughout the prolific oil fields of the Permian Basin, including Midland, Texas. Some energy companies are warning that their oil output—and earnings—are being affected. Laredo...

No longer the worst team in the NFL, the Detroit Lions are now the unluckiest. No longer the worst team in the NFL, the Detroit Lions are now the unluckiest.
Associated Press Competitive week in and week out, the Lions keep losing close games. On Sunday in Buffalo, Detroit failed on a two-point conversion with 14 seconds remaining and lost, 14-12. That was the Lions' second two-point loss, and they've also dropped two games by three points, one by five and one by eight. The most lopsided of their seven losses was by 14 points, and they've won by 12 and 38. Add it all up, and the 2-7 Lions have actually outscored their opponents this season, 215 to 202. Never in NFL history has a team that outscored its opponents had such a bad record. But there's good news: Even if the Lions' record doesn't look like improvement, the team is better than it was the past two years, when it went a combined 2-30 and was outscored by more than 15 points a game. Better yet, their point differential may be a sign of good things to come, as teams that lose despite outscoring the opposition tend to improve the next year. Across a full season, the 4-10 Cincinnati Bengals of 1971 had the worst record among teams with a positive point differential; in 1972 Cincinnati improved to 8-6. Likewise, the 2008 Green Bay Packers went 6-10 despite outscoring their opponents by 39; in 2009, the Packers finished 11-5. The Lions' improvement this year has snuck up on the oddsmakers, who keep installing Detroit as a big underdog. The team is 7-2 against the spread, tied for the best in the NFL. —Michael David Smith The Heartbreak Kids Teams with the worst records despite a positive total point differential (minimum eight games).

The federal government arrested 58 people over the past week in a national crackdown on identity theft led by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice, the tax agency said Tuesday. The collaboration among several federal agencies and local U.S. attorneys' offices targeted people suspected of using false Social Security numbers or other personal information to file fraudulent tax returns, IRS Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement Steven Miller told reporters in a conference call Tuesday. The nationwide sweep resulted in the arrest of 58 people who now face 939 criminal charges across 23 states. A total of 105 people were targeted in the sweep, resulting in the arrests, 19 search warrants, 69 indictments, 10 guilty pleas, four sentencings and other actions, he said. "This was a massive effort," Mr. Miller said. The crackdown over the past week was the culmination of much longer investigations that stretched back for "many months," he said. Most of the incidents are believed to be separate, he said. The U.S. Postal Service Agency and the Secret Service also aided in the investigation. The tax agency has stepped up efforts to prevent identity theft and has new programs in place to spot potentially fraudulent returns, Mr. Miller said. "Our goal is to detect attempts at refund fraud before they occur," he said. He cited schools and hospitals as among the locations where Social Security numbers are stolen for later sale. Mr. Miller said that in 2011 the IRS prevented 260,000 ID thefts involving what would have been $1.4 billion in fraudulent refunds, up from nearly 50,000 thefts prevented and $247 million in fraudulent returns in 2010. In her recent report to Congress, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson included ID theft third on a list of "Most Serious Problems Encountered by Taxpayers" in 2011. The report said a central IRS unit dealing with ID theft received more than 226,000 cases in FY 2011, a 20% increase over FY 2010. In addition to the enforcement actions last week, IRS personnel conducted a special sweep of 150 "money services businesses" such as check-cashing facilities to ensure that they aren't aiding ID theft or refund fraud, Mr. Miller said. Visits were made to nine high-risk businesses in or near Atlanta, Birmingham, Ala., Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Phoenix, Tampa, Fla., and Washington, D.C. The IRS also has more than 250 check-cashing operations under audit across the country and will be looking for indicators of ID theft as part of the examination, Mr. Miller said. Mr. Miller also said the IRS has new screening filters in place to improve the agency's ability to spot false returns before refunds are issued. He acknowledged that the filters slowed delivery of refunds to early filers this tax season but said those refunds are "happening as we speak," and the agency doesn't anticipate further delays.
