Bundesbank prevê que recuperação da Europa levará uma década

Jens Weidmann, presidente do Bundesbank, o banco central da Alemanha. O líder do banco central da Alemanha alertou que a crise de dívida da Europa vai levar uma década para ser superada, acrescentando que uma solução duradoura só seria possível se os políticos parassem de depender do Banco Central Europeu e promovessem amplas reformas estruturais. Em entrevista ao The Wall Street Journal, o presidente do Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, sinalizou que o BCE poderia reduzir as taxas de juros se isso fosse justificado pelos números da economia e da inflação. Mas ele alertou que uma iniciativa como essa não mudaria a sorte das economias da zona do euro.
Weidmann elogiou o acordo firmado entre Chipre e os credores internacionais para o resgate de 10 bilhões de euros (US$ 13,1 bilhões) que impõe pesados prejuízos a grandes depositantes dos bancos do país. Ele disse que, embora o acordo não sirva de modelo para outros, ele mostra a importância de se se estabelecer "hierarquia" em que os acionistas dos bancos arcam com os custos das suas decisões de investimento.
"A superação da crise e os seus efeitos continuarão sendo um desafio ao longo da próxima década", disse ele na sua sala de conferências na sede do Bundesbank, com vista para o distrito financeiro de Frankfurt. O comentário contrasta com a observação recente do presidente da Comissão Europeia, José Manuel Barroso, de que o pior da crise Europeia já passou.
O produto interno bruto da zona do euro deve voltar a crescer este ano, em parte devido à aceleração da atividade global, disse Weidmann. No entanto, "a calma que estamos vendo atualmente pode ser traiçoeira" se ela postergar revisões nos níveis dos países e da Europa.
O euro caiu fortemente em relação ao dólar em resposta às observações de Weidmann, que os investidores consideraram um sinal de que a redução da taxa está sendo discutida. Suas advertências sobre os efeitos duradouros da crise da dívida pesaram sobre o mercados de ações da Europa. Não existem remédios rápidos que o BCE possa aplicar, disse ele.
"Todo mundo está perguntando o que mais o banco central pode fazer em vez de perguntar de que forma os outros formuladores de políticas podem contribuir", disse Weidmann.
Sobre a questão de ajudar as pequenas empresas do sul da Europa a ganhar acesso a crédito barato, o que muitos economistas veem como um ponto crítico para as esperanças de recuperação, Weidmann disse que instituições como o Banco de Investimento Europeu têm melhores ferramentas para lidar com o problema.
Os comentários dele sugerem que, para o BCE relaxar suas regras de garantias ou, numa hipótese mais extrema, comprar dos bancos ativos do setor privado para estimular novos empréstimos, ele provavelmente teria de enfrentar a oposição de um dos seus membros mais poderosos — ele próprio.
E não seria a primeira vez. Weidmann foi o único dos 23 integrantes do Conselho do BCE a se opor, em setembro, à criação de um programa de compra ilimitada de dívida, as chamadas Transações Monetárias Diretas (ou OMT, na sigla em inglês). Autoridades do BCE e analistas privados disseram que a iniciativa garantiu a estabilidade os mercados durante as turbulentas eleições italianas e o confuso resgate do Chipre, em março.
Weidmann, que se preocupa com a mistura das políticas fiscal e monetária, continua discordando. "Para mim, não foi uma surpresa os mercados se acalmarem [...] isso não significa necessariamente que a decisão tenha sido boa do ponto de vista político", disse Weidmann.
Ele rejeita a crítica de que o Bundesbank discorda das medidas para lidar com a crise, como a compra de títulos, sem oferecer alternativas. Segundo ele, o banco central da Alemanha concordou com muitas políticas do BCE e, "além disso, não é uma questão de não fazer nada, mas de quem está democraticamente legitimado a agir e a preservar a união monetária como uma união de estabilidade," disse ele.
Ele endossou o acordo recente entre Chipre e os seus credores internacionais. "O caso cipriota mostrou que é possível fechar bancos. Em princípio, isso é uma coisa boa porque significa que os contribuintes não têm sempre que bancar o resgate dos bancos", disse ele.
Idealmente, os depositantes não deveriam ser tocados, disse Weidmann, mas ressaltou que os depositantes cipriotas receberam taxas de juros "muito mais altas" sobre os seus depósitos do que os poupadores alemães.
Weidmann concedeu a entrevista dias antes da reunião do Fundo Monetário Internacional no fim de semana, que contará com a presença de ministros da Fazenda e líderes de bancos centrais de vários países.
Há meses ele tem lamentado que os bancos centrais estejam sob muita pressão dos políticos para estimular o crescimento das suas economias por meio de taxas de juros baixíssimas e outros recursos, citando o Japão e a Hungria, mensagem que ele pretende levar a Washington, na reunião do FMI.
"Um ponto que eu acho importante destacar — talvez menos aos meus colegas de outros bancos centrais do que aos ministros da Fazenda — é que o remédio administrado pelos elaboradores da política monetária só cura os sintomas e que ele tem riscos e efeitos colaterais", disse.
Esses alertas — sobrecarregar bancos centrais, enfraquecer a independência deles e tirar a pressão dos governos — se tornaram a regra desde que o economista alemão de 44 anos assumiu o comando do reverenciado banco central do seu país, há quase dois anos.
Mas elas ganham uma nova força à medida que a economia mundial emperra. Os bancos centrais dos Estados Unidos e do Japão estão continuando — no caso do Japão, acelerando — estímulos agressivos para garantir a recuperação das suas economias. Apesar da fragilidade da economia da zona do euro, o BCE é uma exceção, já que manteve os juros constantes nos últimos nove meses. Seu balanço está encolhendo enquanto os do Federal Reserve (o BC americano) e o do Banco do Japão estão crescendo.
Comentários de funcionários de alto escalão do BCE indicam que os colegas de Weidermann concordam com a sua opinião de que há limites para o que o BCE pode fazer.
"O BCE não pode fazer tudo para todo mundo o tempo todo", disse o presidente da instituição, Mario Draghi, a legisladores europeus na terça-feira.
Muitos analistas esperam que, com a inflação a 1,7%, abaixo da meta de 2% estipulada pelo BCE, e com a expectativa de que ela caia ainda mais, é provável que ocorra um corte na taxa de juros em maio ou junho. Weidmann não descarta a possibilidade, mas levanta dúvidas sobre o benefício da medida.
"Nós devemos fazer ajustes em resposta a novos dados", porém, "eu não acho que a política monetária é a questão principal", disse ele.
Weidmann admite que é difícil encontrar um equilíbrio entre deixar as forças de mercado pressionarem os governos para que promovam difíceis reformas econômicas e se arriscar a ver a zona do euro se dissolver.
"Às vezes, você tem que ver o abismo para agir", disse ele. "Nós temos que ter certeza de que nós não estamos retirando a pressão para agir sobre os que, na verdade, são os responsáveis por resolver a crise."

From left, plain crystal ship's decanter; claret jug; carafe
Left to right: Arbras Gallery; Dartington Crystal; Around Wine For wine lovers, there are many established norms that always seem to provoke heated discussion. Should you serve only white wine with fish? Does wine need to be chilled? And, the classic restaurant tussle, is your wine corked? But perhaps the most universal flash point is that of decanting. As with all matters vinous, the answer is never straightforward. On one side are the pro-decanters, among whom I count myself, who argue that all wine improves with decanting, while the aesthetic appeal of a shimmering decanter adds to the theater of an evening. Others dispute this, saying decanting can actually deaden the wine's flavors, losing some of its character. How to Decant
View Graphics
Illustration by Anna Parini The two principal aims of decanting a wine are to remove any sediment and aerate the wine. The latter will help draw out its nuanced flavors, soften the harsher, spicier, bitter notes and invigorate the wine. Whether you are decanting a mature or young wine will affect how you pour it into the decanter. Enlarge Image
PourvinLights: in hand polished stainless steel or silicone.
Pourvin All wine that will throw sediment should be decanted; this includes red Bordeaux, Rhône, Rioja, vintage Port and heavy grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Also—and this is open to discussion—young wines. Enlarge Image
Vinturi Aerating funnel.
Vinturi In my experience, exposure to air unfurls the complex layers of flavor in young fine wine. A wine that was tight, closed and rather difficult to taste can, with time in the decanter, transform its personality. The smell changes, becoming replete with ripe fruit; the bitter tannins subside; and the wine opens up, revealing its true character. Generally, I have found this to be the case with Old World wines from the classic regions of Europe, as opposed to New World wines, which change less in the decanter. White wines can also be decanted. Old Rieslings, white Rioja and young Chardonnay all improve with aeration. If you prefer your white wine chilled, there are various decanters that will fit in a fridge, or you can buy an ice-pocket decanter, which has a small built-in capsule for ice that will help keep your wine cool. I prefer my whites lightly chilled and find that a bottle that has been in the fridge for an hour or two benefits from decanting, to take the chill off. How long you should decant a wine for before serving depends on the age and type of the wine. When reviewing wines, I always prefer to decant. A recent example was with an Italian red wine made by Cantine Paradiso. On the first night, the wine was impenetrable, tasting hard, closed and bitter. On the second night, it still wasn't quite there, but by the third evening, I could taste a host of intriguing flavors. There are those who believe certain vintages should be decanted at breakfast, hours before they will be drunk at dinner. Sadly, there are no hard and fast rules on this and it is really down to personal preference. Certainly, very old wine should be decanted just before serving, as exposure to oxygen can cause it to lose its flavor quite quickly. “
Exposure to air unfurls the complex layers of flavor in young fine wine. A wine that was tight, closed and difficult to taste can, with time in the decanter, transform its personality.
”
Young wine can withstand up to three or four hours or, in some cases, days. I am in favor of decanting shortly before I serve the wine—that way I can taste it immediately and track its evolution in the glass. If it turns out to be particularly impenetrable, I can always leave it for the following evening. Choosing Your Decanter This is purely about aesthetics. The shape, size and look of a decanter will not affect the wine inside. The traditional decanter, a glass vessel that holds one bottle of wine, has changed very little in design since the 18th century. There are a range of decanters on the market, from traditional shapes, such as ship's decanters and Claret jugs, to modern, sometimes overly elaborate designs. But any vessel will do—even, if pushed, a jug. Caring for Your Decanter Decanters should be washed and rinsed with hot water after use. Drying a decanter can be particularly tricky; although the outside can be wiped clean with a dry cloth, the inside needs a little more attention. You can drain a decanter by placing it upside down on a draining stand. Another way is to buy drying crystals; these come in a long, thin packet and, when hung inside the decanter, absorb all its moisture. To remove troublesome stains, there are various decanter brushes available. For encrusted wine from the night before, fill the decanter with a handful of uncooked brown rice, pour in hot water and swirl around. Finally, microfiber polishing cloths will help add a shine to your glass. —Email Will Lyons at william.lyons@wsj.com or follow him on Twitter: @Will_Lyons. Explore More

found serious fire-safety concerns at a clothing factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, that burned down last month, killing 112 people, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Yet just weeks before the fire, a majority of the factory's assembly lines were devoted to production for Wal-Mart, according to documents found by the Journal at the wrecked factory. Sand-colored girls' shorts bearing Wal-Mart's Faded Glory label also were found at the charred factory by the Journal. Wal-Mart declined to comment about fire-safety concerns at the factory, Tazreen Fashions Ltd. A Wal-Mart spokesman said Tazreen was removed from the retailer's list of authorized factories "months ago" but declined to be more precise or say if the retailer notified its suppliers. Wal-Mart said a supplier sent garments to Tazreen without authorization and that the retailer is investigating if others did. The factory's owner, Delwar Hossain,
couldn't be reached for comment about the deauthorization. He has said before that audits carried out for Wal-Mart didn't raise fire-safety issues at the factory. The fire has focused attention on apparent lapses in efforts by Western retailers over the last several years to improve conditions for workers that make clothing in emerging-market factories. In Bangladesh and elsewhere, Wal-Mart and other major retailers have mechanisms to audit and approve factories to ensure that their suppliers obtain clothing from manufacturers that are safe and don't employ child labor. But the nature of the system means warning signs often are overlooked, experts and labor groups said. The retailers' monitoring typically is conducted by third parties and paid for by suppliers, rather than by the retailers. Wal-Mart's Standards for Suppliers manual says suppliers are required to disclose which factories they use. When problems are identified or a factory is removed from a supplier's approved list, the news might not be communicated to other suppliers or to the factories themselves, according to interviews with executives in the industry. In Bangladesh, even though one supplier stopped using Tazreen Fashions in the wake of fire-safety concerns last year, other suppliers continued to use the factory, according to interviews with Tazreen executives and documents reviewed by the Journal. It was unclear why the suppliers continued to use the factory. A May 2011 inspection of Tazreen Fashions was carried out for a Wal-Mart supplier, Canada's NTD Apparel Inc., according to documents found at the factory and on the website of Tuba Group, Tazreen's parent company. The firm that conducted the inspection wasn't named. The inspection found that exits and stairwells at the factory were blocked, workers were unaware of evacuation routes and the factory lacked some firefighting equipment, according to documents found at the factory by the Journal. The documents said Tuba Group promised to make corrections by the end of June 2011. STR Responsible Sourcing, part of U.S.-based UL LLC, carried out a follow-up inspection last December, a cover page found at the factory showed. The pages laying out the findings of that visit were missing. UL, which acquired STR last year, didn't respond to requests for comment on the audit. It was unclear if any of the fire-safety deficiencies were addressed. Michael Eliesen,
president of NTD Apparel, said by email that Tazreen Fashions was "delisted" in March as an approved manufacturer and that Tazreen wasn't doing NTD work at the time of the fire. Jahangir Alam,
an officer for ethical sourcing at Wal-Mart's office in Dhaka until late last year, said controlling the supply chain to ensure compliance with ethical sourcing standards was a challenge. "With multiple subcontracts going on, it has become almost impossible for buyers to practice ethical sourcing in the true sense," he said. Wal-Mart's Dhaka office hadn't been closely involved in auditing at factories where its suppliers obtained products, Mr. Alam said. That changed after a 2010 fire that killed 21 people at a factory near Dhaka. Now, he said, "the local office keeps an eye on all the factories producing Wal-Mart labels." The current audit manager for Wal-Mart's Dhaka office declined to comment on whether his department had played a role in removing Tazreen's authorization and why Wal-Mart merchandise was produced there after the deauthorization. Wal-Mart said a supplier, which the retailer declined to name, used Tazreen in violation of the U.S. company's rules and that the supplier has been terminated. "If we determine that other suppliers were using a deactivated factory to produce merchandise for Wal-Mart, that's a violation of our supplier standards," said Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner.
"If that is the case, it is unacceptable and we will take appropriate action." A lack of proper fire-safety precautions has been cited by Bangladeshi officials as a reason that so many people died when the Tazreen factory caught fire Nov. 24. Some people jumped to their deaths from upper floors of the factory because stairwells were engulfed in flame and smoke. The fire escape was inside the building and, like the main staircase, led to the ground floor, where burning balls of yarn blocked the way. Mahbub Rahman,
a marketing employee at Tazreen parent Tuba Group said Wal-Mart hadn't sent his firm documentation saying that Tazreen no longer was authorized to produce clothes for the retailer. He said the first that the company heard that Tazreen had been deauthorized by Wal-Mart was in newspaper articles after the fire. Wal-Mart declined to explain how it alerts suppliers or a factory when it has been barred from production for violation of Wal-Mart policies. Documents found at the Tazreen factory by the Journal and additional documents photographed by labor groups showed that Tazreen filled orders to make Wal-Mart clothing several times this year, despite the fire-safety concerns found in previous inspections and Tazreen's deauthorization by NTD. A Sept. 13 Tazreen production summary, for example, showed about 60% of the 4,100 pieces of clothing made daily was for Wal-Mart. Four suppliers for Wal-Mart worked with Tazreen this year, according to the documents. Two of the suppliers worked with the factory just months before the fire took place. Enlarge Image
Clothes are piled up at the Tazreen Fashions factory after last month's fire. A report in September said most of its work was for Wal-Mart.
Reuters New York's International Intimates Inc. had plum-colored and black satin pajamas made at the factory, according to the documents. A Tazreen executive said the order was placed by International Intimates. René Rofé,
International Intimates' chief executive, said he only found out about his company's business with Tazreen last week. Mr. Rofé said a Hong Kong subcontractor sent the order to Tazreen without his permission. "We never knowingly placed an order with Tazreen," he said. He said his company is still a Wal-Mart vendor. Faisal Textile Resources, a Bangladesh buyer, steered a large order of sand-colored Wal-Mart shorts to Tazreen on Nov. 1, according to a document reviewed by the Journal. Faisal owner Kamal Hossain
declined to comment. Supplier Success Apparel LLC, which is based in New York, had shorts made for Wal-Mart at the factory. Some were placed at Tazreen through a subcontractor. "Success was neither aware nor in any way has authorized the production of our garments in the factory where this tragedy occurred," the company said. "This factory is not on our matrix and we have never done business with them." Success said a subcontractor placed a small portion of Success's order with Tuba Group, which gave the fabric to Tazreen. A Bangladesh representative for Success learned of the unauthorized subcontracting on Nov. 8 and demanded an end to the work there, Success said. "Records indicate fabric and trims were returned from November 12 through November 18," the company said. But a quality-control report found at the factory for what appeared to be Faded Glory shorts dated Nov. 22, two days before the fire, listed the buyer as Success Apparel. Success declined to comment on that report. This March, children's-wear supplier Topson Downs of California Inc. also used Tazreen for Wal-Mart orders, according to documents reviewed by the Journal. Topson Downs said on its website that it monitored "nearly 100%" of the factories it uses, either through its in-house team, or using UL's STR unit. UL has said that the firm had made four assessments for Topson Downs in Bangladesh this year but none of them at Tazreen. Topson Downs's social-compliance director didn't respond to requests for comment. Mikhail Shiper,
a secretary in Bangladesh's Ministry of Labour and Employment, said the government was reviewing labor-safety rules following the fire and would make sure that factories that didn't meet labor laws and safety standards would be shut down. "The Tazreen fire is a wake-up call," he said. In the past, the government had been reluctant to push for safety improvements because of the political clout of the garment industry, according to industry analysts. More than two dozen garment-factory owners are members of Bangladesh's Parliament. —Erica Orden in Los Angeles and Shelly Banjo in Dallas contributed to this article.

Israel Launched Attack in Syria, U.S. Says

Adam Entous, Julian E. Barnes and Colleen McCain Nelson Updated May 4, 2013 10:54 a.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Israeli warplanes bombed a target in Syria in an overnight strike Thursday, U.S. officials said, the second such attack this year in a sign of growing Israeli concern that advanced Syrian weapons could fall into terrorists' hands. The attack came as President Barack Obama, visiting Central America, wouldn't rule out options for the civil war but said he doubted the U.S. would send ground troops to Syria. In a separate...
