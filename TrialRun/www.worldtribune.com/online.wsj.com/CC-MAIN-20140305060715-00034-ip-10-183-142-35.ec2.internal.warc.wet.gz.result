John Binns,
a partner in the consulting practice at U.K.-based Deloitte LLP, assumed his career "would be finished" after he took a two-month leave in 2007 to treat a severe bout of depression. When he told his bosses, they assured him that they would support any effort to get him back to health and working again, encouragement that the 54-year-old Mr. Binns calls "massively instrumental in speeding up my recovery." Still, milder symptoms had festered for nearly a year before a worsening of his condition forced him to come forward. Steve Dininno Read More At Work: When to Talk About Mental Illness "There was no culture of talking about mental health or recognizing that some of our best and brightest people, statistically, would have a mental-health issue," he says. That's not uncommon, and it's becoming problematic for companies as an increasing number of adults seek treatment for psychiatric disorders. While firms appear eager to support employee wellness initiatives, managers are wary of getting too deeply involved in staffers' private health issues. Firms can open the door by offering free, confidential hotlines or generous leave policies, but they can't force employees to volunteer details of their conditions. Most workers have at least a few colleagues who struggle with depression or anxiety. More than one in four American adults has a diagnosable mental-health disorder, and one in 17 has a serious disorder such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But chances are their co-workers—and managers—have no idea who they are. Intentionally or not, "corporations encourage a climate of keeping things under wraps," says Dr. Jeffrey P. Kahn,
a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that companies provide "reasonable accommodation" for employees with disabilities. For someone with a diagnosed mental illness, such accommodations may include anything from offering flexible work hours to allow for weekly therapy sessions, to reassigning the employee to a role with fewer deadlines. The HR office coordinates the effort, generally without ever telling the boss why such accommodations are being made. Prudential Financial Inc.

offers an employee assistance program, training for managers to spot distress among employees, health clinics that screen for mood instability and more. Still, the company recommends employees stop short of telling managers about their diagnoses, says Ken Dolan-Del Vecchio,

is training managers to identify signs of distress in workers, though conversations with a boss about a diagnosis "would never be encouraged," says Paul W. Heck,
global manager of employee assistance and WorkLife services. Managers who do identify distress are asked to remind employees of the assistance program, which can offer free counseling. Deloitte's Mr. Binns brought together a group of company executives and mental-health experts in late 2008 to create Mental Health Champions, which taps unofficial confidants for employees struggling with mental-health or emotional problems. Mr. Binns estimates that 50 to 60 people in his office seek help each year. The "champions" aren't trained medical professionals, but they can provide details on available support and managing disclosure. Complicating such efforts are employees' fears that disclosing a mental illness will derail their careers—a valid concern. Details about a serious mental illness are fair game when researching a job candidate, says Dr. Patricia Cook,
chairman and CEO of Cook & Co., a Bronxville, N.Y., executive search firm. Such psychological troubles are "reasons for red flags," she says, and can raise questions about potential future success. Mentions of depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, which Dr. Cook, a licensed psychologist, calls "diagnostic titles du jour," are a bit less worrisome. Symptoms of some disorders may even be helpful in the office, some say. A person with obsessive-compulsive disorder, for example, could be seen as a perfectionist with a few quirks. Dr. Cook once considered a candidate for an executive-level position whose prior supervisor alerted her to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The candidate was eliminated from the shortlist; she says she provided an "ego-acceptable excuse" without disclosing specifically that it was because of his mental illness. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D., Ill.) is facing calls to withdraw from the November ballot following his announcement earlier this month that he suffers from bipolar disorder. Mr. Jackson withheld details of his diagnosis for months, possibly because he was haunted by the political implosion of Thomas Eagleton, whose depression helped kill George McGovern's 1972 presidential aspirations. Dr. Kahn once treated a manager who didn't submit insurance claims for his therapy sessions, fearing the details would make their way back to his employer. Upon receiving a promotion to a more senior position, the man finally sent in those claims. Executives may be more comfortable disclosing their mental-health histories, Dr. Kahn says, because they see themselves as "immune from adverse effects, which they largely are." Dr. Rich Chaifetz,
CEO of employee assistance program provider ComPsych Corp., says client companies are only told how many employees utilize the service, or how often. They might break down the population by gender, age or issues with which they're dealing, but employers aren't told who called in, or what they sought help with. Federal and local laws protect people with disabilities, including serious mental illnesses, but employers "can always comment on somebody's actual observed performance, behavior [and] interactions in the workplace," says Katharine Parker,
co-head of the employment law counseling and training group at Proskauer Rose LLP. Gabe Howard
worked in information technology at a large Ohio company when he was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorders in 2004, spending several days in the hospital after having suicidal thoughts. Thinking his leave wasn't unlike time off for surgery or family needs, he openly discussed the reason for his absence. The fallout was immediate: One co-worker said that Mr. Howard would have succeeded at committing suicide had he really wanted to die; another accused him of ditching work. He was eventually let go after supervisors complained about his absences and even questioned his diagnosis. He now works as a mental-health advocate and speaker. Bob Carolla,
director of media relations for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, recommends against disclosing a mental-health issue to a manager, if possible, and certainly not in a job interview. "It's not a skill or part of the qualifications that an employer is looking for," he says. Most of the time, anyway. Fifteen years ago, when Mr. Carolla was hired by NAMI, his own history with depression, he says, was "a big selling point." Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com Email

NEW ADVENTURES IN LOW-FI | Peter Buck at his home in Kauai, Hawaii
Marco Garcia for The Wall Street Journal GIVEN THAT R.E.M. was formed in 1980, it's not entirely surprising that the band's lead guitarist, Peter Buck,
has released an album on vinyl. The catch: It came out in 2012. Mr. Buck's raw, ringing guitar style was part of what propelled R.E.M. from college band to critically revered cult group to international phenomenon. The band made alternative rock part of mainstream culture, sold millions of albums and managed to stay together for 31 years. In 2011, its members decided they'd done all they wanted to do and amicably split. Music "not a living anymore, it's a hobby," said the 57-year-old Mr. Buck. It's one he indulges entirely on his own terms. Or, as he put it, understatedly, "I'm staying fairly busy in a casual way." In 2013 alone he recorded multiple albums. There was a second solo record (literally a record—it will only be released on vinyl), "I Am Back to Blow Your Mind Once Again"; a follow-up collection with country-inflected band Tired Pony; one with the Baseball Project, a supergroup that includes fellow R.E.M.-er Mike Mills
; another with the Minus 5; and a collaboration with Ed Kowalczyk,
formerly of Live. He also founded, curates and performs at the annual Todos Santos Music Festival in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Mr. Buck has spent time in Todos Santos since the 1990s and wanted to help local children, who have limited education options. "The one thing I can do is play music," Mr. Buck said. "I figured if I invited friends down we could find a way to help financially." Last year, the festival raised about $80,000 for the community. This year's event begins Jan. 16. In the weeks prior, Mr. Buck took time out from a family trip to Hawaii to chat about packing light, traveling as a tall man and his personal playlist—in digital format on the road, vinyl at home. The best part of touring is: going to cities. I like seeing people I haven't seen in a while. My blood kind of gets flowing hopping in a van even to go somewhere I've been before. Then there's the camaraderie. Very few people in their 50s get to go somewhere in a group and go hang out at a bar or go to the beach. The worst part of touring is: like someone in Duke Ellington's
band said, they don't pay me for playing—they pay me for the other 22 hours of the day. Touring can be a bit brutal. I'm 6-foot-3 and I live in a world designed for guys who are 5-foot-9. Airplane seats don't fit me, and when I sleep in the van I have to sleep curled up in a ball like a dog. When it comes to food, you end up eating something out of a paper bag that you would never eat at home. I like to stay in: the center of a town and walk around. I like a nice hotel; I like the beds to be comfortable. I've slept in hammocks and cots, but the older I get the less likely I am to want to sleep in a hammock. My favorite souvenir was: a first edition of a James M. Cain
novel, "Love's Lovely Counterfeit," that I found in a bookstore in Kenya. I just thought it was so odd that in the 1940s someone was reading a James M. Cain novel in Nairobi. But I don't really buy anything when I go places. I'm trying to get rid of stuff; I have too much stuff. I mostly travel for: music. I probably travel half the year. This year, I went to Europe three or four times, I toured the East Coast. My legal residence is in Seattle; my wife lives in Portland, Ore. I spend a lot of time in Mexico. One of my favorite spots close to home is: Bathtub Gin & Co. in Seattle. It's on an alley, it doesn't advertise and can probably only hold 100 people. There's an Italian place called La Fontana Siciliana that I've been eating at for 25 years. I kind of tend to go to the same places over and over again. My favorite hotel: doesn't exist. There's no place that I think about going just for the hotel. Honestly, what happens is I find a place I like and in about three years they triple the price and I find someplace else. I'm on about my fifth hotel in Los Angeles. Enlarge Image
From left: Todos Santos, Mexico; Bruce Chatwin's 'In Patagonia'
Getty Images; F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal I've always wanted to go: hiking in Borneo. I've read three or four books on it. Unfortunately, the places I've read about have become more civilized—and I might be too old now. I'm planning Turkey and Greece with my wife and daughters. I read Bruce Chatwin's book, "In Patagonia," and I like his writing enough that he's convinced me to go places. It would be nice to spend a month going to the tip of South America, seeing the glaciers. Maybe next winter. I'm trying to make a list of places I want to see before I get stuck in my house or whatever. My travel advice is: Whatever happens, it's not the end of the world. So we're spending six hours in an airport. We'll hang out together—that's fun! One of the reasons you travel is to get out your comfort zone. Sometimes you get farther out than you expect, and that's acceptable. Wherever I go, I try to: figure out what the local people do. I try to eat street food. I like to be the only tourist in a restaurant. Enlarge Image
The coast of Kauai
Getty Images The most romantic place I've been is: this place I go to in Kauai. For me it's all about loved ones and family, so I don't really care where I am, but I brought my kids up here. When I travel I read: a lot of books on my iPad. I prefer hard copies, but I like that anywhere I am I can download books. Enlarge Image

Vivian Johnson My luggage of choice is: this bag I got when [R.E.M.] was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I've used it for seven years now. I can fit in two shirts, three pairs of socks and underwear, PJs, a shaving kit and I go. I travel lighter than anyone on Earth. People see me and say, "You can't be an American!" I capture travel memories with: my head. It gets harder as I get older. I don't have a camera. Now that everyone has to have a cellphone, I have one, too, but I don't carry it with me most of the time. On my travel playlist is: a lot of instrumental music. Free jazz. Old surf music. I listen to a lot of African stuff. My record company is [Portland, Ore.-based] Mississippi Records. I'm about the only living guy on a label that typically specializes in African music from the '50s, '60s and '70s. I get a pile of African funk from there. The names aren't super-pronounceable—I might not even know what I'm listening to. Still, sometimes the Ramones at three in the morning is a great thing. —Edited from an interview by Sara Clemence Explore More

The Obama administration hardened its stance against Syria and stepped up plans for possible military action, dismissing as too late the regime's offer to let United Nations officials inspect areas where the U.S. believes Damascus used chemical weapons last week. The White House and Pentagon signaled the U.S. wasn't backing away from a possible showdown despite apparent efforts by the Syrian government to ease tensions by letting...

Updated Nov. 27, 2012 4:54 p.m. ET
Here's looking at you, kid. Students today react like audiences 70 years ago, endlessly humming 'As Time Goes By.'
Everett Collection For almost as long as there have been movies, there have been sequels. "The Godfather," "Star Wars," "The Lord of the Rings," the Twilight series—if there's anything Hollywood likes more than a blockbuster, it's the follow-up to one. Perhaps it's the dearth of original ideas or the desire among studios to cash in on a proven winner one more time (or two or three more times). So I can't say I was particularly surprised to learn, earlier this month, that there's talk of a sequel to that most storied of Hollywood productions, "Casablanca," which turned 70 on Thanksgiving Day. Despite several earlier attempts that ultimately got the ax, the new sequel is actually an old one, written sometime in the late 1980s by Howard Koch,
who shared the original film's 1943 Oscar for Best Screenplay with Philip and Julius Epstein. The script, "Return to Casablanca," chronicles the afterlives of the four principal characters. After making it safely to America, Ilsa Lund (originally played by Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) attempt in vain to reconnect with resistance fighters Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Captain Renault (Claude Rains) in North Africa. The script's main conceit is that Ilsa has a son from her relationship with Blaine and the boy grows up to be like his father, politically and otherwise. View Slideshow
'Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in "Casablanca." "Casablanca" is a film that has come to represent, possibly more than any other picture, our most fundamental understanding of what movies should be and how they can affect us, writes Noah Isenberg.
WARNER BROS / Ronald Grant Archi In 1989, six years before his death, Koch's idea for the sequel was rejected by Warner Bros. But Cass Warner, granddaughter of studio co-founder Harry Warner, onetime writing student of Koch and head of her own independent production company, Warner Sisters, is determined to have the sequel made, as she recently announced on her website. Whether or not "Return to Casablanca" ever gets made may be of less interest, however, than the fact that it is still being considered. Even this many decades after its release, "Casablanca" remains the go-to film for celebrations of Hollywood. It may not occupy the same mythical place it once did, but its mystique and cult status still endure. Teaching a seminar devoted to the film this semester, I've been pleased to see my students respond the same way that audiences have since the premiere at New York City's Hollywood Theater 70 years ago. They laugh when Peter Lorre sidles into Rick's Café; they get misty-eyed during the singing of the Marseillaise; they cheer on Rick when he aids the Bulgarian couple trying to secure coveted exit visas; they express disbelief when Ilsa boards the plane with Laszlo; and they endlessly hum "As Time Goes By." Amazingly enough, the film's composer Max Steiner, a Viennese-born musician who scored hundreds of Hollywood movies, was initially disinclined to use a popular song. Little did he know that his subtle, recurrent variations of the tune would sear it permanently in our collective imagination. "Casablanca" has come to represent our most fundamental understanding of what movies should be and how they can affect us. Practically every story line plays directly to our common humanity. There's personal sacrifice for the greater good in Rick's relinquishing of Ilsa, the love of his life. There's an ugly truth about the inevitability of moral compromise, embodied by the shifty Renault. And there is an honest look at the noble if unglamorous path of Laszlo, following his convictions. It is the stuff of messy reality in every generation. Then too, of course, there are the iconic performances. Although Bogart had already established his rugged screen persona in such films as "The Maltese Falcon" and "High Sierra," his portrayal of Rick offered a reprise with added complexity and vulnerability. Similarly, Bergman's Ilsa introduced the world to a stylish yet demure femininity—sex appeal without sex. I recently interviewed Leslie Epstein, son of "Casablanca" screenwriter Philip Epstein, and he suggested another factor that makes the movie a perennial favorite. The picture, he said, remains the "archetype of how Americans would like to think of themselves—as tough ('I stick my neck out for nobody') but underneath there's a heart and they do the right thing." It's an idea that is as potent now as ever before. Whether that makes "Casablanca" ripe for a sequel, I don't know. I'll leave that to the executives in the front office. —Mr. Isenberg, who directs the Screen Studies Program at the New School's Eugene Lang College, is working on a book about "Casablanca." Corrections & Amplifications An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the Bulgarian couple in "Casablanca" were trying to obtain letters of transit. Email

BOE Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged
Bank Also Considering Issuing Fed-style Forward Guidance By
Paul Hannon
Aug. 1, 2013 7:14 a.m. ET
LONDON—The Bank of England Thursday left its benchmark interest rate and bond-buying program unchanged, as it considers whether to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in offering guidance on when and under what circumstances it will begin to tighten its monetary policy. A survey of purchasing managers at U.K. manufacturers released earlier Thursday added to mounting evidence that an economic recovery is finally under way, recording the...

KABUL—
Laila Nabizadeh,
a 13-year-old Afghan drummer, will be performing in New York's Carnegie Hall this month, as part of Afghanistan's only national orchestra, which has been touted as a symbol of the country's progress since the Taliban's downfall. But when she returns from her U.S. tour, the new, more conservative winds blowing in Kabul are threatening her budding music career. Ms. Nabizadeh and 10 other members of the youth orchestra are residents of a charity-run girls' shelter in Kabul. She was sent here to get an education by her parents, who live in the remote eastern province of Nuristan, much of which is under Taliban control. From Kabul to Carnegie Hall
View Slideshow
Fikriya, 15, is a cello student at the Afghanistan Institute of Music.
Lorenzo Tugnoli for The Wall Street Journal The tour was planned in late 2011, but in September, Afghanistan's Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs ordered the shelter to halt its music program and replace it with religious classes. Music other than the national anthem and patriotic songs risks "tempting people toward immorality and is against Islam," said Wasil Noor Momand,
the deputy minister for social affairs who signed the order. "Afghanistan is an Islamic country and we want our children to be raised in an Islamic way." The order added that once the girls turn 18, they must leave the shelter, and return to their families in the countryside. Ms. Nabizadeh doesn't know what she will do if she can't become a drummer. But she knows for sure that she doesn't want to go back to her home valley, where girls marry young and music is taboo. "I love playing the drums," she said in an interview at the Kabul shelter. "I want to stay here." As the U.S.-led coalition withdraws in coming years, the move against young musicians is one sign Afghanistan is backsliding on basic rights acquired following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the Taliban regime, which considered music un-Islamic and banned it. Although the central government's official position is that it supports music education among children, music is viewed as blasphemous by Taliban mullahs and some Afghan government officials, and girls face an even-stronger backlash. "We support the promotion of music, especially of Afghan music," said Aimal Faizi, spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who he said wasn't aware of the ministry's order. But political uncertainty and the possibility of a Taliban comeback, is emboldening some officials to promote more conservative agendas. "Everyone is getting more conservative because they are worried that the Taliban will come back or join the government," said Afghan lawmaker Elay Ershad, a member of a parliamentary committee that pushed for a ban on teaching music—a decision she opposed. "It's killing me." The Afghan Child Education and Caring Organization runs Ms. Nabizadeh's shelter. Some 30 other girls studying music live there, many of them from the country's most violent regions. The charity running the shelter partners with the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, the country's recently established music academy, which encourages the girls to audition. Ms. Nabizadeh, who moved to Kabul at the age of 9, enrolled in the academy two years ago. For now, in the shelter's basement-turned-music room, drum rhythms still accompany the piano. Andeisha Farid,
who runs the charity, said she has launched a complaint against the ministry's order and is still waiting for a reply. The parliamentary committee is also reviewing her request to let the girls continue their music classes. It isn't clear, however, how long she could resist the crackdown. "We are scared these voices will get louder," she said. "It's not only under the Taliban—it's still very difficult for these girls to play music." Years of Taliban rule and war took a toll on the country's once-flourishing music scene. "The Taliban destroyed all my instruments and hanged some of them from trees," said Ustad Amruden,
a player of dilruba, a traditional Afghan stringed instrument. The frail-looking, soft-spoken 70-year-old, who is now a teacher at the music academy, recounted having to flee overnight to Quetta, Pakistan, fearing for his life. Though the Taliban have softened their prohibitions on photography, television and girls' education in recent years, "Music is strictly forbidden in Islam," said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.
The music academy where Mr. Amruden teaches and Ms. Nabizadeh studies has around 140 students, boys and girls from the age of 9. Sponsored chiefly by the World Bank, the academy operates under the auspices of Afghanistan's Ministry of Education. Ahmad Naser Sarmast,
the academy's director, said he is confident that music education will survive. "The time when children were deprived of music is gone now," said Mr. Sarmast, a musicologist who started the academy three years ago with the aim of reviving the country's moribund music scene. He said the academy—unlike the girls' shelter— hasn't faced pressure to curb its music-education program. As part of the school's policy, half of the student body comes from underprivileged backgrounds. A majority of them, like Ms. Nabizadeh, were recruited from shelters scattered around the Afghan capital. Others are former street hawkers, who sold chewing gum and plastic bags in Kabul before taking up clarinets, violins and cellos. One recent morning, boys and girls carrying tablas, xylophones and guitars shuffled noisily between classrooms, as members of the school's orchestra crammed in a wood-paneled room for rehearsals ahead of their U.S. trip. They played "The Four Seasons of Afghanistan," a version of Antonio Vivaldi's
violin concertos adapted to include Afghan instruments like the plucked string rabab. Their tour, partly funded by the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, includes stops at Washington's John F. Kennedy Center on Feb. 7, and a performance in New York's Carnegie Hall on Feb. 12. The young musicians said they are looking forward to the trip. For most, it will be their first time outside Afghanistan, or on a plane. "I'm really happy to be going to America," said Sapna Rahmati, an aspiring pianist. But she is aware of music's uncertain position in her country. "The Taliban don't want the music school, and they don't want girls to go to school," said the 10-year-old, who lives in the same shelter as Ms. Nabizadeh. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it wouldn't welcome attempts to restrict music education for children. "Music and music education teaches tolerance, it brings everyone together in a spirit of peace," said embassy spokesman David Snepp.
"Once that happens, it's very difficult to reverse." But Ms. Ershad, the lawmaker, fears what will end up happening as U.S.-led troops leave and the global spotlight shifts away from Afghanistan. "Women's rights and music are soft targets," said Ms. Ershad, a former government adviser on gender issues and a mother of two. "I'm really worried." —Habib Khan Totakhil contributed to this article.

Ugly Choices Loom Over Debt Clash
By
Damian Paletta and Jon Hilsenrath Updated Jan. 13, 2013 8:26 p.m. ET
The showdown over the nation's debt ceiling could force the government to consider drastic steps to manage its limited cash, including delaying trillions of dollars of payments to employees, Social Security recipients, contractors and others. The Obama administration has said it has no backup plan to pay the government's bills if Congress refuses to raise the $16.4 trillion federal borrowing limit. The White House said Saturday in a...
