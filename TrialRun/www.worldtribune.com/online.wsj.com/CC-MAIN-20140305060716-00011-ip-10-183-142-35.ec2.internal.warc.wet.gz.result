U.S. stocks were trading higher Friday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 96 points to 15084, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10 points to 1625, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 20 points to 3464. Among the companies with shares actively trading in Friday's session are Dell Inc. (DELL), home builders, and gold miners. Dell (DELL, $12.87, -$0.44, -3.31%) shares fell after reports Friday that founder and Chief Executive Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners won't increase their $24.4 billion offer for the company, as investors feared his deal wouldn't get done. The go-private deal, which values Dell at $13.65 a share, has faced shareholder opposition and questions on whether shareholder-advisory firms would recommend investors take the offer. Those firms, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co., are expected to issue their recommendations on the deal any day now. Shares of home builders and real-estate firms fell as the latest spike in long-term Treasury yields in the wake of Friday's jobs report is increasing equity investors' fears about home construction getting hit. Lennar Corp. (LEN, $33.65, -$1.70, -4.81%) dropped, along with Ryland Group Inc. (RYL, $38.78, -$2.10, -5.14%), Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH, $41.77, -$2.73, -6.13%), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL, $31.37, -$1.12, -3.45%), KB Home (KBH, $18.03, -$0.68, -3.64%) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM, $18.40, -$0.75, -3.92%). Gold prices slid further as a brighter picture of the U.S. labor market fanned worries that the Federal Reserve would soon curtail its stimulus program. Shares of gold companies like Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM, $27.37, -$1.65, -5.69%), Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX, $13.51, -$1.18, -8.03%) (ABX.T) and Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD, $41.27, -$1.90, -4.40%) (RGL.T) dug lower. 
 
  Other Stocks to Watch: 
 Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU, $63.05, -$1.45, -2.25%) Chairman Chip Wilson has been consistently paring his stake in the yogawear company the past several years, and is now offering some 3.4 million shares that would cut his total stake, including that held by an investment entity, to 25% from 28%. The deal comes a month after a $50 million stock sale occurred in his prearranged trading plan and on the same day Lululemon's board was told Chief Executive Christine Day planned to quit. At current prices, Wilson's planned sale would generate nearly $220 million. Late Thursday's disclosure that Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWE, $10.32, -$0.46, -4.25%) (PWT.T) Vice Chairman Allan Markin was resigning struck National Bank Financial as "rather suspicious." The firm noted that Mr. Markin only joined the board in May amid high turnover in the oil-and-gas company's executive suites and boardroom. Penn West didn't give a reason for the departure. Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc. (RH, $74.57, -$1.36, -1.79%) filed initial plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a minimum 10 million share secondary offering by pre-initial public offering owners, who have made a mint bringing the company back to the market after taking the home-furnishings retailer private in 2008. The proxy contest between Vivus Inc. (VVUS, $12.17, -$0.14, -1.14%) and dissident shareholder First Manhattan Co. heated up Friday as both firms claimed support for their slate of board candidates from several proxy-advisory firms. World Acceptance Corp. (WRLD, $79.59, -$9.12, -10.28%) on Wednesday said it was unable to file certain portions of 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended March 31 because of unexpected delays in completing financial statements relating to additional review and analysis needed to support the company's allowance for loan losses.

Greek Bank Merger Off
By
Alkman Granitsas, Stelios Bouras and Nektaria Stamouli Updated March 14, 2012 1:32 p.m. ET
ATHENS—Alpha Bank AE, Greece's third-largest lender by assets, said Wednesday that it will scrap merger plans with cross-town rival EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA, after the country's debt-restructuring plan torpedoed the deal. In a filing to the Athens stock exchange, Alpha said it had already communicated with the management of Eurobank informing it of its intentions and will call a meeting of shareholders in coming weeks to formally rescind the agreement. Alpha's board is now expected to convene in the final week of March to...

By

Aug. 3, 2011 6:48 a.m. ET
LONDON—Growth in the U.K.'s dominant service sector accelerated in July, offsetting a recent flurry of weak data and raising hopes that the economy's performance will improve in the third quarter, despite setbacks arising from the government's austerity program and a slowing global economy. The services purchasing managers' index increased to 55.4 in July from 53.9 in June, Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing...
