I agree we should take responsibility for ourselves and not become a burden. However, the way the system is set up now is that who pay for long term care are actually getting penalized. Those who don't have long term care, even when they could afford it, have avenues to make themselves qualified to Medicaid when they need it. There should be an incentive for carrying your own insurance. There is a modest tax credit in NY, but it really doesn't amount to much. What is the answer? I don't know.

I purchased LTC Insurance for my wife & myself for two reasons. 1) I have seen long term disability (dementia) deplete the assets of a couple with the result that the surviving spouse was nearly broke when his spouse died. You can spend a lifetime putting together a nice nest egg only to end up destitute in the last years of your life if your spouse has long term needs. 2) I visited medicaid qualified facilities. The nursing homes receive much less money for each medicaid patient versus full pay residents. You quickly see the difference in the quality of care between the two. The nursing home doesn't care if a medicaid patient leaves because her bed will be filled the same day. The full pay resident is treated like a true customer. Those nursing homes that service just medicaid residents are the worst; the smell of urine was overpowering and the neglect was everywhere.

Nursing care homes need to be regulated more closely if that is the case...standard of care is the benchmark...not the cash in hand. If you see this type of criminal activity report it ... more people need to do that if these administrators and medical staff cannot police themselves!

In Germany the children are financially responsible for the Long Term care needs of their parents. In this country, the children can impoverish their parents and get the state to pay the Long Term care cost of their parents by putting them on Medicaid. The children need only to understand the Medicaid look back period and how to title property. Is it any wonder that Medicaid is 40% of most states budgets and growing? When will we take personal responsibility back in the county, before we go broke?

When the nuclear family was destroyed by avid fans of the opposite...responsibility went out the window. The nuclear family existed because it was a healthy and economically sane way to develop as an individual, live and die...now we have caos and are paying for it.

I am all for personal responsibility and paying for your own long term care but not necessarily thru an insurance company. Save on your own and prepare yourself. It's not as expensive as one might think.

I agree, I think we all hope to live a long life so long term care is something most of hope to have need of. It would be kind of like buy hunger insurance so you would be able to eat tonight...

All situations are different. There is another option that usually is not discussed in conversations about Long Term Care. We recently applied for admission into a CCRC (Continuing Care Retirement Community) that will take care of us for the rest of our lives no matter whether we need years of assisted care or not and even if we run out of money. To join, we had to have a significant level of assets and income as well as be in good health. We get to choose either an apartment or patio home and, when and if, the time comes we will move from an independent living situation to an assisted living situation on the same campus. Everything is provided: laundry, meals, fitness programs, recreational and educational programs, healthcare by on-site nurses if needed, maid service, transportation to doctors, stores, and churches, and in-home chores like fixing a faucet or hanging a picture. By living in a facility like this you give up everything associated with home ownership like taxes, maintenance, security, etc. You live virtually worry free. The costs not cheap but neither are the facilities, staff, programs, and meals. In the particular CCRC facility we will be in it will cost $240,000 for the non-refundable fee to enter then around $3,500/month for a 1,200 sq foot apartment that will be totally gutted and outfitted according to our specifications. All the problems of downsizing and 'moving to a nursing home' have been solved for us and for our children. Our children are happy with our decision although it removes a sizeable chunk of money from our estate. Another thing about it is that we are locked into this decision because of the amount of assets we have (we are not rich). But it sure beats wondering what will happen to us when we can no longer take care of ourselves. There are CCRCs all over the country. I would recommend a non-profit, highly rated by Fitch facility that has a waiting list and that you visit and feel comfortable in. Nonprofits have decided advantage over for profit CCRCs.

Apple Makes a Wrong Turn as Users Blast Map Switch
By
Ian Sherr
Updated Sept. 28, 2012 3:32 p.m. ET
Apple Inc.'s move to replace Google Inc.'s mapping software with its own on its mobile devices sparked a world-wide consumer backlash, marking a rare strategic blunder by a company more accustomed to rave reviews from users. As Apple prepped its stores for the first sales of the iPhone 5 on Friday, the company faced vociferous complaints from consumers over the mapping application it released this week, which replaces the Google maps that have been part of the iPhone since the device's initial 2007 release. The new...

Artemisia Gentileschi's Work Comes to Chicago
The artist's famed "Judith Slaying Holofernes" will be the centerpiece of an exhibition
By
Kyle MacMillan
Oct. 10, 2013 10:12 p.m. ET
Artemisia Gentileschi's grisly painting of Judith beheading the invading warrior Holofernes offers a still-shocking take on a biblical scene. But for some viewers, the 17th-century work represents something more—the artist's defiant, cathartic response to her own rape and a lifetime of struggles in a man's world. Five decades ago, Gentileschi's canvases lay forgotten in museum basements. But starting in the 1970s, she became...

Ralph Gardner Jr.
Nov. 6, 2013 11:00 p.m. ET
I'm loath to enter the national debate—about anything—this being a studiously apolitical space, a refuge from the passions of the day. However, as a proud liberal arts major, I can no longer sit back and remain silent in the face of the Obama administration's recent rollout. I'm not talking about the Affordable Care Act, but about a proposed government college-rating system, a school's standing based on factors such as graduates' earnings. Personally, I find such a system offensive. I could argue the obvious: The benefits of knowing Shakespeare backward and forward, or of being able to wow friends and family by identifying the sculptor of a particular fountain while eating gelato in Rome, are intangible. They can't be reduced to dollars and cents. Enlarge Image
Bob Staake But I'm not going to go that route. Or even point out that while an education steeped in STEM—science, technology, engineering and math—might help you land a high-paying job as a petroleum engineer straight out of college, not all of us want to be petroleum engineers. I also won't argue that there's anything wrong with earning $15,000 a year and living at home until your 40s—as long as your parents are OK with that. Rather, I'd like to propose an alternate rating system, one based on hard-nosed reality in an increasingly competitive world. But first, I decided to call Kat Cohen
for suggestions on scorecard categories. Ms. Cohen runs Ivywise, an educational admissions company; and it's not just for college and graduate school, but all the way down to pre-K. She's also a frequent guest on the "Today" show. I first met her in 2001, when I was writing a story for New York magazine about parents pushing back against the SATs. Unfortunately, I could find only one such person—a brave friend who stood up during a college reunion and announced that if getting his kid into our alma mater depended on hiring wall-to-wall tutors, he'd just as well go elsewhere. Bravo, I thought, sensing a trend. I was wrong. It turned out parents were as cutthroat as ever about getting their kids into the Ivies and a handful of other schools. And they were hiring people like Ms. Cohen to help them make it happen. The resulting story, "The $28,995 Tutor," referred to the price of Ivywise's "Platinum Package"—24 sessions spread across junior and senior year of high school, and an hour of phone time a week. When I contacted Ms. Cohen this week, she sounded busier than ever, alluding to her team of tutors and former college admissions officers. However, she reported that the Platinum Package had gone the way of Napster and Vanilla Ice. "We have completely changed our programs," she told me, noting Ivywise's pro bono clients. "We have all different price points." I was curious whether things were as crazy as they were at the turn of the millennium, suspecting I already knew the answer. "At the most selective schools, the admission rates have gone down," Ms. Cohen explained. "That does put parents in a panic." In typical, maddening college counselor mode, Ms. Cohen refused to play the ratings game when I threw out categories in my incipient college-ranking system. For example: "Which colleges, in descending order, will make your peers gasp with envy at cocktail parties when you announce your kid goes to school there?" She insisted, the way all self-respecting college guidance professionals do, that it's about the fit; there are probably a dozen colleges where your child would be happy. Unfortunately, happiness wasn't my question. Ms. Cohen directed me toward a survey she likes, the National Survey of Student Engagement. "They ask questions like, 'Are you working with faculty members on activities other than course work?' and 'Are you discussing class reading outside of classes,'" she explained. That all sounds interesting. But when I visited the NSSE's website, I couldn't find the colleges that participated in the annual survey ranked from first to last. And as Ms. Cohen knows as well as anyone, there's a deep, abiding human need to know where we stand, whether we're superior or inferior to the next guy. So here are some of the categories for my new ratings system. Feel free to suggest your own. We're still in the beta testing phase: • "On a scale of 1 to 10, how much have your social skills, not to mention your clothes sense, improved since Freshman Week?" There's entirely too much focus on academics at college. You can catch up on your reading when you're old and can't get out of bed. The real education comes in learning to spread your wings, without giving anyone else a concussion in the process. That's why we're all in trouble if online universities take off. We'll be giving rise to a race of misfits who refuse to make eye contact. The most underrated aspect of college is making friends, learning to socialize and developing the head of steam essential to launching yourself in the world. • "Are your roommate's parents billionaires, and if not, how easy is it to switch roommates?" I'm throwing out this question for discussion. It well might not make it into final survey. I actually believe the importance of college professional networks in getting ahead is overrated. They might help you get your foot in the door, but you're on your own after that. Incompetence, as I can attest from personal experience, is hard to disguise. On the other hand, it's fun to head for your best friend's private island on spring break when everyone else is slumming it at Atlantis. I can't think of any other questions. But if you find satisfactory answers to the first two, you ought to be set into your 50s. —ralph.gardner@wsj.com

Mr. Mixon, then chief executive of US Investigations Services LLC, warned managers at its Grove City, Pa., operations that USIS wasn't meeting targets for completing checks, say former USIS officials.

The U.S. Supreme Court Monday refused to review a landmark federal racketeering conviction against the tobacco industry, ending the Justice Department's long-running effort to get tobacco giants to forfeit billions of dollars in profits. The high court rejected appeals by both cigarette makers and the government in a 2006 ruling that found the industry violated federal racketeering laws by engaging in a decades-long scheme to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. U.S. cigarette giant Philip Morris USA and other tobacco companies were seeking to overturn lower-court holdings that the industry violated racketeering laws, while the government was seeking to revive its rejected attempt to get tobacco companies to forfeit up to $280 billion in profits and pay $10 billion for smoking-cessation programs. "It's a surprising and favorable industry development, and to an extent the industry dodged a bullet," said Morgan Stanley analyst David Adelman.
The high court's decision not to review the case "forever eliminates the prospect of a large-scale financial judgment in this case." The industry is left with an "unflattering verdict," Mr. Adelman said, but it "didn't have a good reputation to start with." Tobacco shares received a boost from the news. In midday trading, Philip Morris USA parent Altria Group Inc.'s shares were up 65 cents, or 3.3%, to $20.35. Shares of Reynolds American Inc., the maker of Camel cigarettes and another defendant in the case, were up $2.26, or 4.4%, to $53.61. "Although we are disappointed that the Supreme Court did not grant our petitions challenging the basis for the lawsuit, we are pleased that the Supreme Court has confirmed once again that disgorgement [of profits] is not an available remedy," Murray Garnick ,
senior vice president and associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said in a statement on behalf of Richmond, Va.-based Altria Group and Philip Morris USA. The case will return to federal district court, where the judge will issue final rulings on penalties for tobacco companies, which will include various advertising restrictions. Some of those restrictions may overlap with federal regulations imposed since the 2006 ruling. A landmark law signed by President Barack Obama last year gave the Food and Drug Administration broad powers to regulate the marketing and production of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Supreme Court's decision not to review the racketeering conviction is a blow to the Justice Department, which began seeking allegedly "ill-gotten gains" from the industry when it filed suit in 1999. The Clinton administration alleged that nine tobacco companies and two related trade associations engaged in a 50-year conspiracy to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. A nine-month trial took place in 2005. In 2006, after the trial, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler
said as part of her 1,653-page opinion that tobacco companies "have marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success." More High Court Denies Bid by Student Group High Court Rules in Favor of Gun Rights Court Strikes Down Part of Sarbanes-Oxley Court Rules Against Inventors in Patent Case Law Blog: Court Extends Second Amendment to States Political Theater at Kagan Hearings Last year, an appeals court affirmed most remedies that Judge Kessler imposed against tobacco companies, which included restrictions on tobacco marketing and a requirement that the industry make corrective public statements about the health effects and addictiveness of smoking. The appeals court, however, rejected the government's request for additional penalties against cigarette makers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that there was ample evidence to conclude that the tobacco industry intended to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. The court also said the government had adequately proved that the tobacco industry was likely to commit future racketeering violations unless restrictions were imposed. In rejecting the government's bid to have the industry fund a national smoking-cessation program, the appeals court said federal law gave the courts no power to order such a remedy. The Supreme Court let the D.C. Circuit ruling stand without comment. The appeals court had issued another ruling in 2005 that rejected the government's bid to disgorge billions in industry profits. Defendants in the case also included British American Tobacco PLC and Lorillard Inc., the third-largest U.S. cigarette maker.

Trustee Alleges Corzine Masterminded MF Global Scheme
Charge Came in Amended Civil Complaint
By
Joseph Checkler
Sept. 18, 2013 6:51 p.m. ET
Jon S. Corzine and other former MF Global Holdings Ltd. executives acted "recklessly" and with "gross negligence" by using customer funds to cover for the company's foreign-debt bets gone bad, according to an amended civil complaint filed against the collapsed company's former leaders. In the filing with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, a litigation trustee alleged that a "scheme" masterminded by Mr. Corzine, formerly MF Global's chief executive, to buy billions of dollars in European...

YANGON, Myanmar—President Barack Obamaarrived in this once-pariah nation to commend its progress away from military rule and call for more steps to address human-rights abuses, in a visit the White House hopes will help push the nation further down the road of political and economic change. Barack Obama landed in Myanmar as the first sitting U.S. president ever to visit the Southeast Asia country. The WSJ's Patrick Barta explains Myanmar's political progress and what message the U.S. has for China.

Upon exiting Air Force One, the president paused before a girl who presented him with a bouquet. He spent several minutes talking to her before walking on a red carpet through an honor guard of Myanmar soldiers. Myanmar's Political History

"I stand before you today as president of the most powerful nation on Earth, with a heritage that would have once denied me the right to vote," said an advance excerpt of the speech released by the White House as the president's plane departed Bangkok, Thailand. Photos: Obama Visits Southeast Asia

U.S. President Barack Obama takes his first steps on Myanmar soil at Yangon International Airport.
EPA Of Myanmar's changes, he planned to say, "Over the last year and a half, a dramatic transition has begun, as a dictatorship of five decades has loosened its grip," according to the advance text. "Instead of being repressed, the right of people to assemble together must now be fully respected. Instead of being stifled, the veil of media censorship must continue to be lifted." Senior administration officials said Mr. Obama was also expected to call on Myanmar to release remaining political prisoners, follow through on promises to break military ties with North Korea and lead a national reconciliation process to address violence against the country's minority Muslims. "The United States of America is a nation of Christians and Jews; Muslims and Buddhists; Hindus and non-believers," the president was to say. "Our story is shaped by every language and enriched by every culture. We have tasted the bitterness of civil war and segregation, but our history shows us that hatred in the human heart can recede, and the lines between races and tribe fade away." The president also planned to announce the return of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to Myanmar and $170 million in assistance over two years to focus on civil society, democratic institutions, education and similar matters, aides said. Before making the speech, Mr. Obama planned to meet with Mr. Thein Sein,
who has overseen Myanmar's recent reforms, and visit the home of freed democracy activist and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
who was confined under house arrest for 15 years Myanmar's government rolled out some offerings ahead of Obama's arrival. The government announced that it would sign new nuclear safeguards with International Atomic Energy Agencywatchdog agency against nuclear weapons proliferation. Myanmar's relationship with North Korea and its nuclear program has been a point of concern for the U.S. The government said that it had granted amnesty to 66 prisoners of conscience. Activists said that the most high-profile was Myint Aye, founder of a human-rights network who was arrested in 2008 while distributing aid to survivors of a cyclone. He was convicted of a bomb plot and sentenced to eight years in prison. The move follows the release of about 450 prisoners last week, although rights groups say there were no political prisoners among that batch. Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Crosswill be allowed to resume prison visits in the country for the first time since 2005. The government also said it would become a full member of the Open Government Partnership by the end of 2016 to make it more open and accountable by international standards. Mr. Obama is visiting three Asian countries in less than three days on the ground, sandwiching the tour between congressional negotiations over the budget Friday and the traditional pre-Thanksgiving pardoning of the national turkey Wednesday. The White House sees the trip as critical to Mr. Obama's effort to pivot U.S. attention away from the Middle East, where two wars have long occupied American attention, and toward Asia, where the president is working to beef up U.S. influence in part as a counterweight to China in the region. The outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas just before he left, however, has interfered with that shift in focus. The trip to Myanmar is the most significant stop on the trip, and the most fraught. Many human-rights activists argue that the government should have done more to prove itself before being granted a presidential visit. They cite sectarian violence that is raging against minority Muslims in the Buddhist-majority country, political prisoners who remain jailed and a constitution that still requires 25% of seats in Parliament be filled by members of the military. "The Burma visit does a lot of things: it makes history, heralds reform, counters China. But one thing it doesn't do is strategically promote human rights," said John Siftonof Human Rights WatchAnd this is why it's so important that the president at least secure some real concessions, like political-prisoner releases. If not even that much can be achieved, the trip will be an utter loss." In Thailand on Sunday, Mr. Obama sought to explain that his visit should be seen as support for change, but not an endorsement of the government. "If we waited to engage until they had achieved a perfect democracy, my suspicion is we'd be waiting a long time," Mr. Obama said at a news conference with Thailand's prime minister, Yingluck ShinawatraChange can happen very fast if a spotlight is shown on what's going on in a country and the people there start believing that their voices are heard around the world. And this visit allows me to do that in a fairly dramatic fashion." U.S. officials have said that engagement over the past year, such as sending Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the country, appointing the first U.S. ambassador in 22 years and loosening economic sanctions, have been met with further reforms, not backsliding, such as when the government released about 450 prisoners last week. They expect continued progress from the Obama trip, which will include a speech to the nation and a visit to the home of democracy activist and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, where she was confined under house arrest for 15 years. On the streets of Myanmar on Sunday, there appeared to be a mixture of excitement and nonchalance about the coming Obama visit. On a busy stretch of road in Bahan, a commercial district about a 10-minute drive north of Yangon's downtown, a large canvas banner hung above a shop draped with American flags welcoming Mr. Obama to the country and congratulating him on his recently won four more years. "Before, when I used to travel, people had no idea which country I came from, but Obama has helped change this," said 29-year-old Zeya Winn. His family business has been printing flags and T-shirts for three decades and has sold about 70 U.S. flags, mostly to government authorities who plan to dot the streets with them when Mr. Obama arrives, as well as to companies and diplomatic missions. A few hundred meters up the street, a fresh mural paid homage to the U.S. president, one of several that have sprung up in recent days. But in the bustling downtown district, stalls carried printed T-shirts bearing the faces of Ms. Suu Kyi, her father and independence hero Aung San, reggae icon Bob Marley and punk-rocker Sid Vicious. Posters featured Avril Lavigne and Jesus Christ. Mr. Obama's image was nowhere to be seen. "We can get you one, we just need five days notice to print it," the vendor said. —Sam Holmes in Yangon and Celine Fernandez in Kuala Lumpur contributed to this article.

China and Britain have reached a three-year deal to swap their currencies when needed, the first such agreement between Beijing and a major developed economy and a move that could help boost the Chinese yuan outside Asia. In a statement released late Saturday, the Bank of England said Governor Mervyn King and his counterpart at the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, signed an agreement to set up a three-year swap line with a maximum value of 200 billion yuan ($32.6 billion). It means that Bank of England could draw on...

No one gets the better of Rafael Nadal. Enlarge Image
Rafael Nadal
Getty Images Nadal, a favorite to win the U.S. Open after an undefeated hard-court season, is the only player in the world with a winning record against every other player in the Top 30. Roger Federer,
who has fallen to No. 7 in the world, has a losing record against two members of that group (Nadal and No. 3 Andy Murray), and is tied 1-1 with 12th-ranked Kei Nishikori. Novak Djokovic, the No. 1 player in the world, has a losing record against Nadal and Federer, and is also tied 1-1 with Nishikori. Five players have a lead on Murray: Djokovic, Nadal, No. 5 Tomas Berdych, No. 11 Milos Raonic and No. 25 Philipp Kohlschreiber. (Murray is tied 1-1 with No. 18 Fabio Fognini and No. 20 Kevin Anderson.) Nadal, the eight-time French Open champion, is famous for solving Roger Federer, beating him 21 times in 31 meetings. But two years ago, it looked like he had come up against his own nemesis: Djokovic. From 2011 to early 2012, Djokovic beat Nadal seven straight times, all in finals. Since then, Nadal has won five of their six meetings and increased his head-to-head advantage to 21-15. Few players in the current Top 30 have a realistic chance of reversing their head-to-head record against Nadal. One candidate: Jerzy Janowicz, the 22-year-old from Poland who reached the Wimbledon semifinals this year. Janowicz, ranked No. 14, lost his only match against Nadal, in Montreal this summer, by a score of 7-6(6), 6-4. If they play on grass or at an indoor tournament, Janowicz has the firepower to score an upset. He also has time on his side: Nadal is 27 and has a history of knee problems. They could meet in the Open semifinals. —Tom Perrotta

Farah Contractor had to think about her future in a way that few other 14-year-old girls must. The Churchville, Pa., teenager was diagnosed with a type of leukemia in 2011. The standard treatment—which includes a bone-marrow transplant—was known to damage the reproductive system and could make her infertile. Soon after she was diagnosed, Ms. Contractor's doctor advised her that if she wanted to have children someday, she could...

Neighbors reacted as Amanda Berry arrived at her sister's home Wednesday, two days after she and two other missing women were found.
Reuters CLEVELAND—The former school-bus driver charged Wednesday with kidnapping and rape for allegedly holding three women in his home for a decade used deceptively simple ruses to lure each woman into his car, according to a police report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Ariel Castro
simply offered one a ride home; told another that his son worked at the same Burger King as she did; and offered to bring a third to see his daughter, a school friend, according to the report prepared by responding officers on the night the three women—and the daughter of one of them, born in captivity—escaped. Mr. Castro, a 52-year-old musician and former school-bus driver, faces four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape, said city prosecutor Victor Perez. In a news conference unveiling the charges, police said the women had only one chance to escape the entire time. "The only opportunity…to escape was the other day," based on interviews with the women, Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Edward Tomba said. He was referring to Monday's dramatic events when 27-year-old Amanda Berry
called to a neighbor, who helped her, her 6-year-old daughter and the two other women break out of the modest two-story home. The police report described a nightmare scenario in which Ms. Berry, Gina DeJesus
and Michelle Knight
were taken to Mr. Castro's home and chained in the basement. Although the chains were later removed and they moved upstairs, they were all forced to have sex with Mr. Castro, the women told police. Ms. Knight told police she had become pregnant five times, with Mr. Castro starving her and punching her in the stomach each time until she miscarried, according to the report. Ms. Berry told police she had given birth to her daughter, Jocelyn, in a plastic pool. Ms. Knight described delivering the baby and reviving her at one point with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, under threat of death from Mr. Castro if she let the child die, according to the report. Ms. DeJesus also said she had sex with Mr. Castro, but told police she didn't think she had become pregnant. House Where Kidnapped Women Were Held

On the night she escaped, Ms. Berry told police that Mr. Castro had left the main front door open, but the storm door was locked and she couldn't get it open. Although she feared that Mr. Castro was testing her, she said she called to neighbors across the street, who helped her escape. The report described responding officers crawling through the storm door before they could get it open and search the basement, which was empty. Upstairs they found Ms. DeJesus and Ms. Knight, who threw herself into the arms of one officer. The women said they were locked up in the house and let outside only in the backyard, outings during which they had to keep their heads down, according to the report. Ms. Berry told police that Mr. Castro would sometimes take Jocelyn out, but he didn't allow her to know the real names of Ms. DeJesus and Ms. Knight, in case she said the names in public. In a statement to media, the sister of Amanda Berry requested privacy as she returned home from being kidnapped from a Cleveland neighborhood 10 years ago. Photo: AP.
More Three Young Lives Before Disappearance Family of Another Missing Girl Holds Out Hope The women described Mr. Castro's car as a blue Mazda Miata convertible. He was arrested a short time later in the parking lot of a McDonald's. His brother Onil was in the car with him, and police arrested both men. Onil Castro told the officers where they could find their other brother, Pedro. He was visiting their mother. Ariel Castro waived his Miranda rights and gave a detailed statement to authorities after his arrest, police said earlier Wednesday. Officials said he didn't have a lawyer and was expected to be arraigned Thursday morning. Onil and Pedro Castro weren't charged in the case. The brothers were also expected to be arraigned Thursday on unrelated misdemeanor warrants. Ms. Knight was the first of the women to be kidnapped, in 2002, when she was 21. Ms. Berry was abducted in 2003, the day before her 17th birthday, and Ms. DeJesus was kidnapped at age 14, in 2004. This undated photo released by the Cleveland Police Department shows Ariel Castro.
AP Mr. Tomba said in an interview that Mr. Castro was extraordinarily protective of his home. Even his brothers had no idea about Mr. Castro's imprisoned victims, according to police. "You didn't get into his house. You called before you went over," Mr. Tomba said. "He ran the show and he acted alone." The only time the women were allowed to venture outside over the years was to make two trips to the property's rear garage, officials said. And even then, only two of the women went, and they were forced to wear hats and wigs to disguise their identities, Mr. Tomba said. Officials said they would conduct a paternity test on Ms. Berry's daughter to confirm if Mr. Castro is the father. Mr. Perez, the prosecutor, said in an interview that each of the first-degree felony charges against Mr. Castro carries a minimum of three years in prison, but any conviction could result in a longer sentence given the circumstances of the case. Officials also said there could be other charges as the case progressed, but they didn't expect Mr. Castro to be linked to any other victims. Photos

A law-enforcement official said the women and young girl in the house were able to watch television and listen to music but had no contact with anyone outside the home. As the years went on, the official said, at least some of the women were able to move more freely inside the house. The official said investigators were still exploring a motive in the case. Mr. Castro claimed to authorities that he was maltreated as a child, the official said.

Ms. Knight remained in a hospital Wednesday, but Ms. Berry and Ms. DeJesus were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers in triumphant homecomings. When Ms. DeJesus arrived at her family's home Wednesday afternoon in a black minivan, her father emerged from the vehicle waving his arms in celebration, as many of the gathered neighbors chanted "Gina!" Ms. DeJesus, wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt and appearing somewhat unsteady on her feet, flashed a thumbs up to the crowd and walked in the house without commenting. Afterward, Ms. DeJesus's mother, Nancy Ruiz, said she had "grabbed her and hugged her, I didn't want to let her go." More Video
The three women who emerged from a Cleveland home on Monday years after they were reported missing are the rarest of kidnap victims: They appear to have been taken by a stranger, were held captive for years—and lived to tell about it. Jack Nicas reports.

WASHINGTON &ndash; President Barack Obama Tuesday urged lawmakers not to delay overhauling the U.S. health-care system, calling the window before the Senate's August recess a "make-or-break" period for legislation. "We can't afford to put this off," Mr. Obama said at the start of a meeting with 24 Senate Democrats. The White House and Democratic lawmakers are pushing to get a health-care deal done by year end. Mr. Obama, who made brief remarks but didn't take questions, acknowledged it would be a "heavy lift" to cinch a bill that expands medical coverage and controls the rise of health-care costs. Earlier Tuesday, the White House released a report outlining the expected benefits to the economy of containing health costs. Republicans said the administration hasn't divulged enough details of its health-care plans, and they said their nonparticipation in Tuesday's White House meeting shows a lack of bipartisanship. Mr. Obama was flanked in the State Dining Room by Democratic Sens. Max Baucus and Christopher Dodd, and top advisers including Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Health Reform Director Nancy-Ann DeParle. "Health-care reform is not a luxury; it's not something I want to do because of campaign promises or politics," Mr. Obama said. "This is a necessity." The report out Tuesday, compiled by the Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that a 1.5-percentage-point cut in the annual growth rate of health-care costs would raise real gross domestic product by more than 2% in 2020 and by almost 8% in 2030. That kind of growth would add $2,600 to a typical family of four's income in 2020, according to the White House. (See the text of the report.) "If we do reform well...the key impact is that it's very good for the economy," Council of Economic Advisers Chair Christina Romer said. "If we don't do this, we're going to be facing a real mess 30 years from now." On Monday, six private groups gave more details of the promise to trim the growth of health-care spending, promoting large savings through administrative cost-cutting and changes in the care of chronic diseases. —Patrick Yoest contributed to this article.
