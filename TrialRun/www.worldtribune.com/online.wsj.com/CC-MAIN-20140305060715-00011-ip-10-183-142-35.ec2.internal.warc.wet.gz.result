to lose $440 million, it was the latest in a series of trading blowups that have rocked stock markets. Yet it is doubtful many retail investors saw an impact in their own accounts. After all, the erratic moves in the prices of certain stocks traded by the firm—pushed by millions of dollars worth of erroneous trades—reversed themselves in mere minutes. A trader works at the Knight Capital kiosk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 1.
Reuters The bigger risk to small investors might be if "market makers" like Knight, which play a huge role in executing retail trades, were to disappear altogether. In that case, small investors could be forced to pay higher prices for stocks and funds they buy and get lower prices for ones they sell, at least temporarily, say market experts. Because Knight handles a large portion of retail orders, its disappearance would have a significant impact on retail investors, says Scott Freeze,
president of Street One Financial, an exchange-traded-fund research and trading firm. A software problem caused Knight to accidentally purchase $7 billion of stock. The company sold the bulk of it later that day and the next morning, but the snafu nevertheless led to a loss that brought the company's survival into question. Last weekend, Knight agreed to a rescue from a group of investors that included one of Knight's competitors. Measuring the Impact Unless they traded one of the affected stocks during the glitch, small investors likely felt little impact. Yet some more-frequent traders could have had automatic "stop-loss" orders, which kick in when prices of designated shares dip below specified thresholds. Portfolio managers of mutual funds that small investors hold also could have been caught in the turbulence. Widespread news coverage of the glitch has further shaken investors' confidence after years of market volatility and trading snafus. On Thursday, discount brokerage E*Trade Financial

ousted its CEO amid anemic customer trading activity. Knight functions primarily behind the scenes as a market maker, providing liquidity in certain stocks and ETFs and handling orders from brokerages, including those of TD Ameritrade, Scottrade and Vanguard Group.

a brokerage will sometimes send the trade to a company like Knight, which can either fill the order with shares from its own inventory, cross it with offsetting trades from other customers or send the trade out to an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, for certain securities, if a seller or buyer isn't immediately available, Knight can buy the shares itself while it looks for another buyer. Other market makers include Getco, which took part in the investor bailout of Knight, and major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs Group.

Knight, and firms like it, take on risk by temporarily holding the shares, even if for a fraction of a second, since the share price can move down before the company manages to sell. To compensate for that risk, firms try to buy the shares for a price slightly below where they think they can sell. The market-making process allows investors to sell stocks and ETFs in seconds, even if they are selling stock of a company that isn't frequently traded. So what would happen if a firm like Knight were to go under? "You'd certainly have a big period of disruption," says Miranda Mizen,
director of equities research at TABB Group. "They're like the trunk of a tree that has all its roots in the market. It would take time to assimilate." Abnormally High Spreads Among the potential effects: Infrequently traded stocks that Knight made a market in could have abnormally high spreads between buying and selling prices, meaning small investors could in effect lose more money every time they trade, says Terrence Hendershott,
a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who researches market makers. An illiquid stock that normally had a 20-cent spread between its buying and selling price, for example, might temporarily have a 25-cent spread, says Prof. Hendershott. "Presumably another [market maker] would step in, but the question is 'How quickly?' and do they have the knowledge needed" to take Knight's place, he says. If one of Knight's rivals permanently stepped in, Street One's Mr. Freeze says, the rival might be able to charge small investors a larger spread because it would face less competition. "Where an investor would really see the performance of their portfolio change is the prices they'd end up paying for stocks," he says. Write to Joe Light at joe.light@wsj.com Email

"Try again. Fail again. Fail better." Playwright Samuel Beckett's words might as well be Royal Bank of Scotland's mission statement. Certainly, RBS restructuring plans have joined death and taxes among life's inevitabilities. The 81% state-owned U.K. bank's latest reorganization follows a monumental £9 billion ($15 billion) net loss last year. Whether new chief executive Ross McEwan's revamp will work is anyone's guess,...

Rahm Emanuel's campaign for Chicago mayor has raised $10.6 million through Jan. 19, according to a statement from his campaign office. Mr. Emanuel also will be able to use $1.1 million transferred from his congressional campaign account, for a total of $11.7 million. Mr. Emanuel's opponent Gery Chico, who has served as Mayor Richard M. Daley's chief of staff and president of Chicago Public Schools, raised $2.4 million from July 1 through Dec. 31, according to his filing Thursday with the Illinois State Board of Elections. Thursday is the deadline for candidates to submit their semiannual campaign-finance reports. Polls show Mr. Emanuel, a Democrat running in a nonpartisan election, holds a big lead. The vote is set for Feb. 22 and if no candidate wins a majority a runoff between the top two contenders will be held April 5. So far, Mr. Emanuel has successfully fought off a lawsuit brought by two city residents challenging his candidacy filed last year with the Chicago Board of Election Commissions. The suit claims he forfeited his city residency when he moved to Washington to become President Barack Obama's chief of staff. The commission and a circuit judge have ruled in Mr. Emanuel's favor. Those decisions are being appealed and a ruling is expected this week. Whatever the outcome, the case is expected to go to the Illinois Supreme Court. On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton stumped for Mr. Emanuel in Chicago. Mr. Emanuel became Mr. Clinton's finance director during his first presidential bid and then served in the Clinton White House. —Lauren Etter contributed this article.

Proposal Would Help Move U.S. Toward Cleaner Energy Sources
Associated Press Sept. 19, 2013 11:49 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—The Obama administration will press ahead Friday with tough requirements for new coal-fired power plants, moving to impose for the first time strict limits on the pollution blamed for global warming. The proposal would help reshape where Americans get electricity, away from a coal-dependent past into a future fired by cleaner sources of energy. It is also a key step in President Barack Obama's climate-change plans, because...

THE LIFE OF RILEY | Sunday Riley
Victoria Will WHEN SHE WAS 12 years old, Sunday Riley
got her first wrinkle cream. "I bought it myself," said the 36-year-old Houston-born-and-bred founder of the eponymous skin care and cosmetics brand. "I was interested in makeup and beauty at a young age." It wasn't just a phase. After studying chemistry at the University of Texas, she worked in cosmetics labs, where she found she could bridge a gap. "Whenever there was miscommunication between the scientists and the marketing people, I was able to say: 'I understand what they're saying,' " Ms. Riley explained. When she launched her own line in 2009, that experience gave her an advantage over other product-peddling aestheticians and makeup artists. "I knew about a lot of little secrets in the industry," she said. "All ingredients are not created equal. When you go and buy chemicals for your skin care products, you can buy different grades, and that completely affects the products." She added, "The person selling it at Sephora probably has no idea." Her ethos is to buy the purest, A-grade raw materials and to make sure they're formulated in a way that's effective. While her products don't qualify as "all-natural," she describes her method as "clean technology." "[It's] sustainable chemistry with more purified ingredients," she said. "Transformative ingredients tend to be very advanced, the opposite of what you would find in most natural products." Of course, Ms. Riley's way of working doesn't come cheap—her best-selling Good Genes serum is $105 for one ounce. Later this month, she's planning to launch two new oil formulas: Isis, which targets wrinkles, and the light and quick-to-absorb Artemis. Early next spring, look for new foundations and brushes.

Clockwise from left: Sunday Riley Good Genes; 'The Paleo Diet' by Dr. Loren Cordain; Sunday Riley Honeymoon blush; Kérastase shampoo; neroli oil; fresh aloe vera
F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal (treatment, book, oil); Getty Images (aloe) Being southern, my aunt and my mother were very into beauty. You didn't leave the house unless you had lipstick on. I'm a big believer in essential oils. I use neroli, which is really calming and kind of balances your mind. I'll mix neroli and a little bit of lavender and rose. It's something I'll even spray onto my pillow before I go to bed. One of my favorite ingredients is lactic acid. Short term, it exfoliates and plumps up fine lines naturally. People should use it every night, before they put on anything else. It will help drive that cream or serum deeper into the skin. My grandmother was into fresh plants. She'd never buy the aloe vera gel that's bright fluorescent green; she'd always cut it fresh outside. I use a lot of sunscreen. I'm very fair and I live in a very sunny environment. I use my Cashmere SPF 30 first thing in the morning—two pumps is my ritual. I don't leave the house without my blush on. I use a really peachy color with a little bit of shimmer, called Honest, every morning. It's incredibly important to apply skin care in the middle of the day, too. I carry a small sample of Juno oil and Good Genes serum in my purse to refresh my skin throughout the day. I try to avoid all sugar. I'm a paleo diet person—basically a sugar-free, gluten-free diet. Mine's not totally strict. I will eat some dark chocolate, and definitely drink red wine on weekends. Every day I snack on macadamia nuts. People are very anti-fat, but the right type of fat is actually great. It keeps you from getting hungry, and macadamia nuts are also good for your skin. You need protein for antiaging. To look awake—I've got two kids and I work late after they go to bed—I use [my mascara] in Midnight Sapphire, a deep indigo black. It really does make the whites of your eyes look brighter. I always dab concealer on the interior corner of the eye. People just put it in that half-moon of skin under the eye, but that interior spot really gets quite shadowy and tired. If you have darker skin, put just a touch of gold eye shadow there; if you have lighter skin, use a touch of something shell-like. Enlarge Image
Sophia Loren
Corbis If you have great blush, mascara, foundation, skin care and a red lipstick, you can pretty much do whatever you want. Those are the things that make people say, "Oh, you look great." For my hair, I tend to use Kérastase products. I'm always looking for the a hair product that's going to make me look like Sophia Loren. I never find it. My secret indulgence is Thai massage. If you get a regular massage and it's horrible, you're stuck there for an hour. With Thai massage, you have something to focus on, you know: "Twist me! Go for it!" I'm a big supplement taker: liquid sovereign silver for my immune system, a ton of spirulina and evening primrose oil for my skin. People I work with make fun of me, saying, "It's a pharmacy on your desk!" For exercise, nothing has changed my body like ballet barre class. In Houston, I go to a place called Define. When I travel, one of the first things I look for after a hotel is where I am going to do my barre class. It has pulled everything in and strengthened it. I always carry red lipstick. I'm kind of religious about that. I wear Sunday, a red lipstick we came up with that's a very, warm bright red. A lot of women find red lipstick unapproachable, but this is a very friendly red. —Edited from an interview by Jenni Avins Explore More

Crocodile jackets and fur sunglasses reign in Milan as designers cater to Russian and Asian clients who couldn't care less about prices. WSJ On Style columnist Christina Binkley joins Lunch Break to recap her wild week in Milan. Photo: Getty Images.
Milan The fall 2013 collections shown here were rife with opulence. Crocodile jackets, python cocktail dresses and mink shoes stood out, even as a new voluminous silhouette set the shape of high fashion for fall. It's as if designers are competing to top one another with confections created from exotic materials and deft handwork. Dolce & Gabbana, inspired by a 12th-century mosaic in the Sicilian town of Monreale, embellished stunning dresses with tiles and sequins that recreated images from the mosaic. Prada used fur from the pekan, a mammal in the weasel family, in coats, and created dresses using four layers of a silky gauze. Pleat Feats: Bottega Veneta's take on the trend of volume at the shoulder.
Ansa/Zuma Press A crocodile suit by Prada.
Getty Images Continuing a trend seen in New York, beaver, mink and other furs were everywhere, often decorating hems and sleeves. With a wink at fashion, Karl Lagerfeld included fur shoes, fur skirts, fur bags and even fur sunglasses in his Fendi collection. Astrakhan, which comes from fetal or newborn lambs, appeared widely, from Marni's coats to Brian Atwood's
boots. Looks such as these are often called "editorial" because they are created to catch the eyes of fashion editors. But these days, many of the actual clothes are being snapped up by boutiques in Dubai and Moscow or by online retailers such as Net-a-Porter. Much of the ultra-luxe action is aimed at new wealth from Russia and Asia, where some consumers are buying singular looks with little regard to price. Mr. Atwood's sales team is holding a contest to see who can sell the most pairs of $22,000 crocodile boots. "I'm personally going to sell four myself," said Riley Viall, the company's chief executive, at the Milan showroom. She said she's offering the winning salesperson a spa day. Even in less expensive materials—tweeds and bonded wools—a curvaceous silhouette set a new shape for coats and dresses. Recalling looks that originated in Paris haute couture in the 1950s, rounded drop shoulders emerged on New York's runways and were confirmed as a trend in Milan. Outstanding collections included Bottega Veneta, where designer Tomas Maier folded fabric to create pleats and space around the shoulders. By achieving volume without reference to 1950s couture, Mr. Maier was in sync with the trend without looking remotely trendy. That's exactly what the label is all about. Prada's Shetland-wool sweaters and gingham-patterned coats and dresses of stiff wool created a nostalgic feel. It wasn't one of the label's mode-setting collections, but it was resonant days later. Dolce & Gabbana's collection was one of its most notable after several seasons of inspiration from Sicily, where Domenico Dolce
and Stefano Gabbana
vacation. While the mosaic dresses will be priced to the stratosphere, prints based on them should be more affordable and enjoy a long life. Some consumers may welcome the return of the Pucci print to the runways. Peter Dundas, the designer since 2008, has showed army fatigues and sequined lingerie but not the label's signature psychedelic prints. Having established Pucci as a go-to label for the red-carpet set, the designer took a left turn and opened his show with the zany swirls. Black sandal-boots from Salvatore Ferragamo
Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Dramatic shapes and materials are invigorating to avid fashion lovers, but not every retailer is looking for sudden change. The new volume is a sharp turn from the flattering wasp waists and tight shoulders of recent seasons. "I'm a little concerned about that," said Saks vice chairman Ron Frasch on the way out of Dolce & Gabbana's show on Sunday. But he said his buyers were finding plenty of less-extreme looks in showrooms. "Extremes are never great," he said. "But there's always room for both." Brian Atwood crocodile boots
Brian Atwood Over-the-Top Opulence One Dolce & Gabbana mosaic dress, whose price is estimated at $14,400, was worked on by 10 tailors. A pair of Brian Atwood crocodile boots is priced at $22,000. And Prada did a whole suit—price not yet available—in crocodile. A double-face wool Galitzine jacket used mink, astrakhan and couture-like piping at the neck, bringing its price to roughly €3,750 ($4,926). Models in patent leather dresses at the patent leather dresses Vesace fashion show in Milan.
Getty Images Fetish Fever Milan isn't known for clothes that look like they come with a whip. But fetish-style looks appeared in a number of collections, from Gucci's python body suit and weapon-like spike heels to Ferragamo's black patent trench with corset-lace sandal-boots. Versace, one luxury label where a red leather dress looks perfectly in order, showed a playful mix of preppy plaid, punk pins and studs, and patent leather dresses and coats.

Galitzine Sleepwear to Streetwear Galitzine and Missoni included pajama looks, a smaller trend that is likely to grow, especially since Marc Jacobs showed pajamas in New York. On the streets, the tops will work better than the bottoms, and at designer prices, shoppers may want to think twice before sleeping in these satiny confections. "I think they are for daywear," said Sergio Zambon, Galitzine's designer. "But if you get drunk, you can come home and sleep in them." Enlarge Image

Gucci/Getty Images Gucci Loafer Flashback It's 1953 again on some runways, so how appropriate that Gucci would bring back its horse-bit loafer, which debuted that year. It's the 60th anniversary of the loafer, which has defined luxury men's shoes for generations. Clark Gable and Fred Astaire wore the leather loafers. But, it being 2013, the anniversary edition now comes in crocodile and python, too.

MILAN—American Amanda Knox
and her Italian former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito
are to face a new trial on charges of murder and sexual assault for the 2007 killing of British student Meredith Kercher,
after Italy's highest appeals court overturned a lower-court acquittal in a case that became a media sensation. "Our battle continues," Giulia Bongiorno,
a lawyer for Mr. Sollecito said in a television interview shortly after the ruling. "This has never been an easy path…but Raffaele has always had the great force of his innocence to support him." Ms. Bongiorno said the new trial would be held in Florence, although the exact timing is unclear. Another lawyer for Mr. Sollecito, now 29 years old, said proceedings could begin late this year or early in 2014. It was also unclear whether the Florence court would order a full retrial, or examine only portions of the original ruling. Back to Court

The Wall Street Journal In a statement, Ms. Knox, 25, who wasn't in court, said she found the news "painful," adding that "the prosecution's theory of my involvement in Meredith's murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and unfair." Ms. Kercher, who was a university student in the city of Perugia, was found partially clothed in a pool of blood in the apartment she shared with Ms. Knox in 2007. Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were subsequently arrested on suspicion they had stabbed her to death during a sexual assault. The case grabbed the world media's attention, and had many Americans voicing concerns over whether Ms. Knox would be properly tried in Italy's slow, and at times complex, legal process. Enlarge Image
Luciano Ghirga, a lawyer for Amanda Knox, leaves court in Rome on Tuesday.
Associated Press Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of having murdered Ms. Kercher, and were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison, respectively. But after they spent four years in jail, an appeals court acquitted the pair in October 2011. Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito maintained their innocence throughout the trials. Rudy Guede,
an Ivory Coast national, was convicted of murdering Ms. Kercher and sentenced to 16 years in prison, having exhausted the appeals process. During the trial, he denied having a role in the murder. Ms. Kercher's family has disputed arguments that Mr. Guede acted alone. Following the acquittal, Ms. Knox returned to her home in Seattle, while Mr. Sollecito resumed his studies in Italy. Ms. Knox has since written a book that is due to be published next month by Harper Collins, which is owned by News Corp.

News Corp. also publishes The Wall Street Journal. On Tuesday, Italy's high appeals court, which rules on procedural matters and not on the merit of a case, accepted a public prosecutor's request to put Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito back on trial. Prosecutor Luigi Riello
and Ms. Kercher's family sought to have the acquittal by the lower appeals court overturned, arguing that the motives behind the decision were contradictory. The high court didn't reveal the reasoning for its decision, but is expected to publish a full explanation in the coming weeks. Enlarge Image
Ms. Knox after arriving in Washington from Italy in 2011.
Reuters Francesco Maresca,
a lawyer representing the Kercher family, welcomed the ruling, saying that the 2011 acquittal had been "without any merit or detail." Neither Ms. Knox nor Mr. Sollecito is required to appear in Florence for the next trial. Moreover, they have the right to appeal the next ruling, meaning that a final resolution of the case could take another couple of years, lawyers say. Carlo Dalla Vedova,
a lawyer for Ms. Knox, said she was unlikely to travel to Italy for the trial and would likely appeal should she be convicted in a second trial. "She is very bitter," he said. "She thought she could put an end to this nightmare today." An Italian prosecutor has more possibilities to appeal a ruling than exist in the U.S., thereby prolonging a case in a judicial system that already is notoriously slow. Should the court convict Ms. Knox, Italian authorities could ask the U.S. to extradite her to serve out her sentence in Italy. However, the U.S. doesn't normally extradite its citizens to face legal action. Instead, Italy and the U.S. could agree for Ms. Knox to serve any prison time in the U.S., lawyers say. During the trials, Ms. Knox became a highly divisive figure, depicted as a cunning she-devil in Italy and a victim of a ham-handed Italian justice system in the U.S. Critics charged that the case was based mostly on circumstantial evidence. A turning point in the appeals trial came when an independent panel of forensic experts said that clumsy handling of the police's main evidence—a tiny amount of DNA on a knife and a bra clasp—could have allowed for it to be contaminated. The acquittal fueled sharp criticisms of the Italian justice system in Italy and abroad. Write to Gilles Castonguay at gilles.castonguay@dowjones.com Corrections & Amplifications Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito are due to face a new trial on charges of murder and sexual assault for the 2007 killing of Ms. Kercher. A previous version of this article said Ms. Kercher was killed in 2009. Email
