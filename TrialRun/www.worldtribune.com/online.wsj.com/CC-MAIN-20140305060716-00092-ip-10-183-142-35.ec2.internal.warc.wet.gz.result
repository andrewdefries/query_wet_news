Walter Russell Mead: The Euro's Global Security Fallout
Expect Russia and Turkey to drift away from the West. NATO will be a loser too.
By
Walter Russell Mead
June 18, 2012 7:16 p.m. ET
The crisis of the euro zone is a geopolitical as well as an economic event. While Europe may yet find a path out of its economic quagmire, it will turn inward for some time as it reorganizes some of its core institutions. The world will not stand still while this happens. To begin with, Europe's disorder is a grand opportunity for Russia. It is not all good news in the Kremlin—Russia will hurt economically, as the European Union is its most important trading partner and customer for oil and gas. But geopolitically, Russia...

Among the classical music cognoscenti, Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff has a certain reputation: gushy and opulent, certainly not serious—an old-fashioned romantic who never caught up to the modernism of the 20th century. Pianist (and super-fan) Kirill Gerstein said this isn't the composer's fault, but that of his interpreters. "There are a lot of performances that are, let's say, uh, very indulgent," Mr. Gerstein said. When asked to explain "indulgent," he replied: "Well, I'm being polite. There are performances that make him sound like a vodka-soaked Russian sailor." Enlarge Image
Pianist Kirill Gerstein outside the Upper West Side building where Rachmaninoff once lived.
Philip Montgomery for The Wall Street Journal This Thursday through Saturday, Mr. Gerstein brings his own interpretation of Rachmaninoff—restrained yet virtuosic, nearly classical, presumably nonalcoholic—to the composer's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini," which he will perform with the New York Philharmonic and conductor Semyon Bychkov. This is Mr. Gerstein's subscription-series debut with the philharmonic; he previously played summer concerts with the orchestra in New York and Vail, Colo. Mr. Gerstein has big shoes—or rather, hands, as Rachmaninoff's spanned an octave and a half—to fill; the philharmonic's first performance of the piece was with the composer himself as soloist, at Carnegie Hall in 1934. ("The composition is very difficult, and I should start practicing it," Rachmaninoff wrote.) The other day, Mr. Gerstein stopped by the building where Rachmaninoff lived from 1926 to 1934, on the corner of West End and 84th Street. After a doorman informed some visitors that, yes, people do occasionally stop by to ask about the composer but, no, he doesn't know the apartment number, Mr. Gerstein headed to a nearby coffee shop to extol the virtues of the man he views as underappreciated and misunderstood. A treasure trove of information about Rachmaninoff can be found in recordings of the composer playing his own music, Mr. Gerstein said. "As I revisit these recordings, every year Rachmaninoff plays better and better," he said, laughing. "Which means that every year my own development makes me understand how incredibly good his playing is." Mr. Gerstein talks about interpreting Rachmaninoff in phrases associated with Mozart: classicism, sense of control, restraint. (Granted, these traits are coupled with "some of the hottest music.") "When the performance is transparent, when its classicist roots are clear, and yet there is this so-called quote unquote Russian sound, then it's quite clear that he's really a great composer," Mr. Gerstein said. He said Rachmaninoff's aura is ever-present in the cultural ether in Russia, where Mr. Gerstein, who is 33, was born. He took a detour into the jazz world—he moved to the U.S. at age 14, to study at Boston's Berklee College of Music—but eventually came back to classical music. These days, he splits his time between New York and Stuttgart, Germany, when not on the road. If Mr. Gerstein were to have met Rachmaninoff, what would he have said? "I think I'd be happy just to be in his presence, just to feel his strong magnetism," said Mr. Gerstein, who had been talking about the composer with such nonstop vigor that a companion occasionally reminded him to pause and take a bite of a grilled-cheese sandwich. "I'm not sure it would be so necessary to talk."

Employing unusually sharp language, the U.S. on Wednesday openly criticized Germany's economic policies and blamed the euro-zone powerhouse for dragging down its neighbors and the rest of the global economy. In its semiannual currency report, the Treasury Department identified Germany's export-led growth model as a major factor responsible for the 17-nation currency bloc's weak recovery. The U.S. identified Germany ahead of its...

Today's Pentagon is losing its most important battle, the one for its own future. The Defense Department's latest evaluation report on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter reveals how badly that fight is going, and why. There have been many stories about the F-35 Lightning II's problems and delays, and its looming total price tag of $1 trillion, up from prior estimates of $331 billion and $177 billion before that. Still, the DOD's Jan. 14...

Egyptians Detain Suspected Terrorist Ringleader
By
Siobhan Gorman
Updated Dec. 7, 2012 7:47 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Egyptian authorities have detained the alleged ringleader of an Egyptian terrorist network whose members are suspected of participating in the September attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, U.S. officials said. The apprehension of Muhammad Jamal Abu Ahmad removes a man who Western counterterrorism officials consider one of the most menacing operatives to emerge in the region in the wake of the Arab Spring. His capture would blunt what authorities say are...

Majority Backs Stricter Laws for Gun Sales
By
Laura Meckler
Jan. 17, 2013 6:35 p.m. ET
A majority of Americans favors stricter laws governing the sale of firearms, though more people blame recent mass shootings on a lack of parental involvement with children and effective mental-health treatment than on gun availability, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds. The poll finds that President Barack Obama has at least some measure of public opinion behind him as he launches an effort to persuade a reluctant Congress to pass new gun restrictions. In the survey, 56% of Americans said laws covering the sale...

A nor'easter is expected to dump between two and 20 inches of snow on the Northeast. Brad Lyon, International Research Institute for Climate and Society Research scientist, joins The News Hub with the latest. Photo: AP.
The New York region, where few snowflakes have been glimpsed all winter, launched itself onto emergency footing Thursday as authorities forecast a blizzard for Friday packing wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour and dumping as much as two feet of snow. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning, taking effect at 6 a.m. Friday and extending to 1 p.m. Saturday, and said near white-out conditions would make travel "extremely dangerous." While New England is expected to absorb the brunt of the winter nor'easter, late forecasts Thursday indicated that New York City, Long Island and New Jersey would begin seeing significant snowfall beginning as early as Friday afternoon.

European Pressphoto Agency Metropolis Northeast Braces for Major Blizzard Weather Journal: Big Blizzard Heads for Big Apple NYSE Expects 'Business as Usual' as Winter Storm Nears Metropolis: Bloomberg: Leave Work Early as Storm Approaches In areas recovering from superstorm Sandy, authorities voiced concern that flooding and storm surge could wreck dunes and beaches that have been steadily rebuilding over the mild winter. New York state emergency and transit officials said they were taking the impending snowstorm "very seriously," and recommended New York City residents avoid travel Friday afternoon—taking Friday off if possible. Officials said the city could see between 12 and 20 inches of snow, with wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour. Storm surges in coastal areas could reach 3 to 5 feet, said Jerome Hauer, commissioner of the New York state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services. He said that compared with Sandy-driven surges that topped out at more than 13 feet. New York City schools planned to remain open Friday as of late Thursday, officials said. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority anticipated a hectic commute beginning Friday afternoon. Service could be "temporarily reduced or suspended" on Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road.

Associated Press In low temperatures, freezing rain, or with the accumulation of more than five inches of snow, subway service in New York City could also be hampered, the MTA said. Some express trains could run as locals, and other lines could be curtailed. Heavy snowfall also would likely hamper city bus service. The city Department of Transportation warned commuters on the Staten Island Ferry to expect delays Friday afternoon. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said more than 250,000 tons of salt was on hand and that crews aboard plows and salt-spreader trucks would be working round-the-clock starting at 7 p.m. Friday. "Having it happen overnight Friday into Saturday is probably as good timing as we could have because the sanitation department then has the advantage of cleaning the streets when there's normally less traffic," said Mr. Bloomberg, who held a news conference at a West Village Sanitation Department depot. Alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules are suspended Friday. Mr. Bloomberg received some of the toughest criticism of his mayoralty following a Dec. 26, 2010 storm when city services seemed overwhelmed. That winter, 61.9 inches of snow fell in Central Park, federal records show. Since then, snowfall has been scant. During the 2011-2012 winter, 7.4 inches fell. This winter so far: 5.1 inches. A blizzard is defined by sustained winds or frequent gusts of wind measuring 35 miles per hour or more, with snow falls that reduce visibility to less than a quarter mile, according to the weather service.

European Pressphoto Agency With historic snow totals and widespread power outages possible, emergency-management agencies set contingency plans into motion. The Long Island Power Authority, which serves Long Island and some sections of Queens, said that National Grid, which normally handles operations for LIPA, also would "communicate storm preparation and storm response to the public," a spokeswoman said. LIPA was widely criticized for how it communicated with customers and local officials during and after Sandy. Lacking a computerized system to track information about power outages, LIPA relied on an outmoded system of paper maps, photos and Post-it Notes to coordinate its service efforts with National Grid. A spokesman for the governor's office said it had been communicating with National Grid over several weeks to ensure they make advance preparations and response plans for storms. Snowfall could reach two inches an hour Friday evening, said Gary Szatkowski, meteorologist for the National Weather Service's forecast office in Mount Holly, N. J. said. "We could be looking at some very treacherous and dangerous road conditions," he said. "If you're stuck in your car for six to 12 hours, that's no fun." According to FlightAware.com, more than 240 U.S. flights were canceled by late Thursday afternoon, and more than 1,100 were already canceled for Friday, including more than 200 at Newark Liberty International Airport, more than 50 out of La Guardia Airport and 24 out of JFK airport. Amtrak officials said they would shut down service in the Northeast beginning just after midday on Friday. The final Northeast Regional train will depart Boston for New York at 1:40 p.m. Friday, and the final Acela Express will leave at 1:15 p.m., the railroad announced. The last departure from New York's Penn Station toward Boston will be the 1:03 p.m. Acela. In New Jersey, the storm is expected to cause flooding and a storm surge of around three feet along the Atlantic coast north of Atlantic City—the same area ravaged by Sandy. "This is going to slow people down there for several days and may undo some of what was done since Sandy," said Mr. Szatkowski,of the weather service. Still, the storm surge is likely to be less than half that experienced during Sandy, Mr. Szatkowski said. He advised coastal residents to prepare for flooding, including bay areas that didn't traditionally get hit with water intrusions until Sandy. Officials with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the agency was deploying additional staff and is assembling snow-fighting equipment for area's airports, bridges and tunnels, and the PATH train system. NJ Transit said it expected to run normal service on Friday and Saturday—but that was subject to change. In Sandy-battered neighborhoods in the Rockaways, some residents who weathered the October storm said they were taking all precautions. On Thursday, Jonathan Perez, a 25-year old construction worker who lives on Beach 114th Street said he was going to buy gas and all the supplies he might need in the event of a major disruption to heat and electricity. "We're prepared this time," he said. "I stayed through all the storms this year—I'm not leaving for this. I've been rebuilding my home myself since Sandy." —Ted Mann, Eric Holthaus, Lisa Fleisher and Danny Gold contributed to this article Write to Tamer El-Ghobashy at tamer.el-ghobashy@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com Email
