Years of warnings by health officials and grim news on the bathroom scale appear to finally be having an impact on the nation's eating habits. While there is no sign the high level of obesity has fallen, Americans say they are consuming fewer calories and cutting back on fast food, cholesterol and fat. Working-age adults consumed an average of 118 fewer calories a day in the 2009-10 period than four years earlier, according to a study released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Americans also reported eating...

Surgical scrubs that resist microbes and repel blood. Tuxedos that can be tossed into the washing machine. Basketball undershorts that help players jump higher. Work clothing today not only has to look good, it is expected to make wearers perform better, be it a hospital, a hotel restaurant or a sports arena. To this end, researchers at a handful of lab facilities across the country are prodding, pulling and pounding high-tech uniforms, looking for advancements—and a competitive edge. Clothes That Do More Than Look Good

Nike employee Tyler Lynch ran on a treadmill next to a robot named Hal at Nike's Sport Research Laboratory in Beaverton, Ore.
Leah Nash for The Wall Street Journal More photos and interactive graphics At a corporate campus in Beaverton, Ore., a 5-foot-8½-inch robot named Hal walks on treadmill in a climate-controlled chamber. Sensors measure Hal's sweat and body temperature in 30 zones, testing whether his uniform provides enough ventilation to stay dry and cool—but not cold. Nearby, a human tester runs on a treadmill with several sensors taped to his body, gauging whether his workout garb allows his body temperature to rise naturally without spiking too high. These testers are part of Nike Inc.

's Sport Research Laboratory, a 16,000-square-foot facility with sections of a running track, sport courts and artificial turf for testing gear for various sports. Force-plates are embedded in the floor to gauge the impact and weight distribution of athletes' feet. Eighteen researchers, from physicists and biomechanists to exercise physiologists and materials scientists, create and test concepts here, aided by engineers, designers and physicians. About one in five workers wears a work uniform of some kind, according to the North American Association of Uniform Manufacturers & Distributors. That is roughly double the level of 10 years ago, says Richard Lerman,
the association's president, who cited growth in service jobs and employers' desire to improve their corporate image and tighten security. Sports is where much of the R&D for uniforms first occurs. Darren Stefanyshyn,
an associate professor of biomechanics at the University of Calgary, Canada, has been studying athletes jumping and running in the lab for years. There he noted, "when you analyzed an ankle, knee or hip, they acted very much like springs." Working with sportswear-maker Adidas, Dr. Stefanyshyn, who has co-authored many peer-reviewed studies on athletic wear and performance, helped develop ways to mold thermoplastic polyurethane bands to fabric to support and guide muscles in their movements. Dr. Stefanyshyn says lab tests indicate that athletes wearing undergarments with the bands on key muscle groups post small but noticeable gains in their ability to sprint, run and jump. Dr. Stefanyshyn is submitting the research to a peer-reviewed scholarly journal later this year. Based on his research, Adidas is using the "TechFit PowerWeb" technology in its National Basketball Association uniforms and other gear. Medical-wear makers are borrowing tools from the athletic-wear industry. When physician assistant Lara Manchik
wanted a lab coat that was as comfortable as the waterproof, breathable sportswear she wore, she founded Medelita, San Clemente, Calif., which uses similar technology to produce scrubs that wick off sweat. The company also treats the fabric with Teflon to repel stains and shed spills and body fluids, says Joe Francisco,
president. Other uniforms help protect health-care workers against infectious disease. Vestagen, an Orlando, Fla., maker of anti-microbial, fluid-resistant medical wear, treats cloth with chemicals, runs it through high-pressure rollers and cures it in ovens up to 50-yards long, says Ben Favret,
the company's president. Scientists test fabric samples by plunging them into a broth of microbes, such as antibiotic-resistant staph, and measuring later how much of the bacteria survive, he says. One of the most important feature of today's uniform is comfort. Manufacturers have mostly eliminated the stiff, shiny uniforms of the past. Becky Knight,
a retired Western Airlines flight attendant, recalls the double-knit polyester uniform she wore in the mid-1970s. Such outfits trapped heat, sweat and odor. "It was horrible, like a rubberized suit," says Ms. Knight, of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. "There was absolutely nothing natural in that thing." She was relieved when cooler uniforms were issued, using new polyester blends. The latest polyester fabrics are still durable, but wick away moisture and help keep wearers cool, dry and odor-free, says Janice Henry,
a vice president for Superior Uniform Group in Seminole, Fla. To make sure the fabrics won't pill, lose their shape, tear, bleed or fall apart after washing, the company runs them through abrasion machines, tumbles them inside a chamber lined with corkboard, and plunges them into a "laundrometer," a steel canister with metal balls inside that "literally beats up the fabric," simulating five launderings in one cycle, Ms. Henry says. A "crockmeter" rubs fabrics together to see if dye colors transfer. A "tear tester" gauges the force required to rip a fabric. Work & Family Mailbox Raising Creative Kids Uniform maker Cintas Corp.

, Mason, Ohio, has water bottles recycled into pellets, then into flakes which are woven into yarn, says Donna Knechtel,
product manager. The yarn is used in making washable tailored suits for hotel, transportation and other workers, and even a washable tuxedo uniforms for banquet servers. The company also markets a golf-style shirt made of recycled polyester and charcoal derived from coconut and bamboo, to eliminate odors; the shirt can be sent back to the company for recycling. Uniform makers continue to push for their own version of the Holy Grail. Among hoped-for advancements, Ms. Henry cites self-cleaning uniform fabric made of tiny nanofilaments so small that liquids bead and roll off like marbles, preventing the cloth from ever getting stained or wet. Also on the radar are uniforms embedded with light-emitting diodes that produce glowing promotional images; or uniforms made of "smart fabrics" woven with sensors to monitor the condition of soldiers, firefighters or other workers assigned to dangerous environments.

Adam Entous
Updated June 15, 2013 2:56 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has approved keeping Patriot missile-defense batteries and F-16 warplanes in Jordan, officials said Saturday, in a move aimed at shoring up support for the kingdom and at deterring Syria. The White House this week approved arming Syrian rebels, an effort that is expected to mainly take place in Jordan. The U.S. military has proposed options to the White House to safeguard that effort,...

Japan Approves Modest Stimulus Package
By
Takashi Nakamichi
Nov. 30, 2012 5:54 a.m. ET
TOKYO—The Japanese government on Friday approved the second stimulus package in a little more than a month, as the approaching election and a faltering economy put pressure on the ruling party to act even as analysts doubt the effectiveness of the move. Roughly double the size of the previous stimulus plan announced in late October, the new package contains ¥880.3 billion ($10.74 billion) in spending. It will draw on existing...

By
Suzanne Vranica and Evelyn M. Rusli July 25, 2013 8:19 p.m. ET
Facebook Inc. is winning more friends on Madison Avenue. The social-media giant's better-than-expected second-quarter results, driven in part by a big increase in mobile advertising revenue, signaled that after a rough start, the company has made marketers feel more comfortable with spending money on the social network. "The service has improved and the company is a more attentive to advertisers now," said Adam...

Amateur genealogists, beware. Researching your ancestry doesn't always turn up heroes and royalty. It may turn up a felon, a bigamist or another unsavory character. Jean Wilcox Hibben upended family lore about an ancestor's distinguished Civil War service.
Gary Friedman A pension record said Frederick Mueller had been discharged in 1862 after developing a hernia from 'excessive marching and a fall over a log.
Jean Wilcox Hibben Frederick Mueller Jean Wilcox Hibben New York filmmaker Heather Quinlan
found more than a few skeletons when digging into her ancestors' closet. Among them: Thomas Fagan,
her grandmother's great-grandfather, who had killed a man during a drunken bar fight in 1868 (reportedly hitting him over the head with a chair in self-defense). She also turned up evidence of a murderous feud—set off by a scandalous elopement—that had engulfed her grandfather's ancestors in the 1830s. One forebear was hanged for the killings, but others, including her fourth great-grandfather, escaped after the jailer forgot to lock the cells. "It was like the Hatfields and McCoys meet Romeo and Juliet, with a touch of 'Mayberry R.F.D.' thrown in," Ms. Quinlan says. Last year, people curious about family trees spent $2.3 billion on genealogy products and services, according to a 2012 study by market-research firm Global Industry Analysts. And while nearly everyone who researches ancestry is caught off guard by some finding, says genealogist Terry Koch-Bostic,
a Mineola, N.Y.-based director of the National Genealogy Society, a nonprofit education, training and records-preservation group, roughly 1 in 5 of those surprises are negative, she estimates. The bombshell may be the discovery of someone up the family line who engaged in illegal or immoral activity. "We all find things that are really shocking and surprising," she says. Experts say reactions can range from detached bemusement to identity confusion and soul-searching as the researcher tries to understand—and rethink—his or her lineage. Families who research their ancestry can discover a valuable sense of identity and history--or a nightmare. WSJ's Sue Shellenbarger and filmaker Heather Quinlan join Lunch Break to discuss.
For Ms. Quinlan, the news of her rampaging relatives was cause for some head scratching. "We're actually not a violent bunch," she says. But she regards the stories as evidence that her forebears were fiery and colorful, family traits that have since emerged in more positive ways through careers in the arts and public service. Acceptance can be harder, experts say, when the story is particularly grisly or the unsavory relative sits closer in the family tree. Crista Cowan,
a genealogist with Ancestry.com, the largest subscription genealogical website, says a client she worked with a few years ago was aghast to learn that his great-great-grandfather was the notorious "sausage king," the owner of a Chicago meatpacking plant who was convicted of murdering his wife and disposing of her body in a sausage grinder. Stunned, the man broke off contact for a few months before returning to Ms. Cowan to learn more. The growth of genealogical Web research has facilitated many such discoveries. Membership on Ancestry.com rose 54% since 2010 to more than 2 million, while Cyndi's List, a service that catalogs genealogy links on the Internet, has more than tripled its postings in the past decade to 325,000. But for many family historians, things that used to be considered embarrassing just aren't that big a deal any more. "The black sheep, the skeletons in the closet these days are celebrated, if anything, because we have become more open-minded and flexible," says Megan Smolenyak,
a Haddonfield, N.J., genealogist and author of "Hey, America, Your Roots Are Showing," a book about surprising genealogical discoveries. Her advice: "When you look at what your ancestors did, you don't get the glory and you don't get the blame. It just means you have a colorful story to share." More Work & Family Mailbox: The Roots of Job Satisfaction After setting out to explore the basis for her parents' scary hints about "a witch in the family," Betty Jo Blevins,
an Alliance, Ohio, medical receptionist, found her seventh great-grandmother Mary Bliss Parsons.
The wife of a prosperous merchant and town councilman in 17th-century New England, she was accused by neighbors of using sorcery to kill a baby and a cow, then accused again 18 years later of causing the death of another neighbor. Tried and acquitted twice, she spent months in prison, and historical accounts suggest she never shed the stigma, says Ms. Blevins. Genealogical DNA testing, available for over a decade, enables people to trace blood relatives and lost ethnic roots. Finding bloodlines that cross racial lines can challenge long-held assumptions about identity, says Ms. Smolenyak. Some 95,000 such tests are performed annually at a cost of about $100 to $400, the Global Industry Analysts study says. Uncovering family secrets can also lend insight into current problems, says Lisa F. Platt,
an assistant professor of psychology at St. John's University in Collegeville, Minn., who has researched use of family-tree information in therapy. Becoming aware of patterns of alcoholism, divorce, abuse or other misbehavior can make it easier for people living today to understand and change them, she says. Ron Arons, an Oakland, Calif., author and speaker, found a great-grandfather had served time for bigamy
Mark Bennington The ancestor's second marriage certificate.
Ron Arons Ron Arons
set out to piece together his family's past after discovering a box of documents and a family tree following his parents' deaths. After being raised believing his forebears were all upstanding citizens, the Oakland, Calif., author and speaker was astonished to discover that his great-grandfather Isaac Spier
spent four years in Sing Sing prison for bigamy. According to newspaper accounts, Mr. Spier was arrested after a wild police chase and a police-station confrontation with both wives, says Mr. Arons. He also uncovered records showing that Mr. Spier was accused, but never convicted, of extortion and attempted larceny. He chronicled the findings in a 2008 book, "The Jews of Sing Sing." The resulting insights have amounted to "extended psychotherapy," solving some childhood mysteries, Mr. Arons says. He always wondered why his grandmother pounced on him when he joked about getting sent to Sing Sing for bad behavior, scolding him, "Don't you dare use those words in front of your grandfather!" And his childhood memories of his grandfather as "a total clown," wearing crazy hats to make him laugh, carry new, bittersweet resonance. Those secrets and jokes "must have masked his utter sadness," he says of his grandfather, knowing that "his father was a crook." Other family researchers find themselves debunking proud family legends. Jean Wilcox Hibben set out to explore a story she heard as a child about a great-grandfather, a scholar and musician who was heralded for serving as Union General William Sherman's
scribe during his historic "march to the sea" and capture of Savannah, Ga., during the Civil War. Instead, she learned that her ancestor never saw action and was discharged after less than a year for a hernia caused by "excessive marching and a fall over a log," says Dr. Hibben, a Lake Mathews, Calif., genealogist, speaker and folklorist. She suspects her great-grandfather's estranged wife "made the story up to make him look like a better guy for his kids." "I felt obligated to break the news to the family," and "it wasn't well-received," says Dr. Hibben. But she is at peace with it, believing her forebears "did the best they could with what they knew." The take-away for her: "My ancestors were human, and it's OK if I'm human too." Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com Email
