Philadelphia Today's plutocrats collect art, often big art. Millions of dollars are commonplace for works by Picasso, Pollock, Rothko, Warhol, the usual suspects. Books—those smaller objects one can hold and read, as well as admire for beauty and value—have attracted the attention and the money of wealthy collectors (most all of them men) ever since Johannes Gutenberg
began the revolution of movable type six centuries ago. Times change. Bookmen may now be going the way of bookstores—witness Larry McMurtry's
summer sale in Archer City, Texas, which sold off most of the inventory of his used-books store there to other dealers from all over the country—and books themselves may soon become a quaint, disposable part of cultural history. It was not always thus. Many gentlemen (think of J.P. Morgan) had libraries. Enlarge Image
A.S.W. Rosenbach's library.
Susan Beard Design One is here, at 2008-2010 Delancey Place, off Rittenhouse Square, the part of William Penn's
"green country town" resembling a larger version of New York's West Village. In the middle of a block of four-story 19th-century row houses shaded by towering sycamore, locust and maple trees stands the Rosenbach Museum & Library, the 1954 legacy of two bachelor brothers whose collections, especially the books, are nothing short of amazing. Philip Rosenbach
(1863-1953) specialized in decorative arts, paintings and furniture. His younger brother, A.S.W. (1876-1952)—with a 1902 doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania and a dissertation about the influence of Cervantes on Shakespeare
—was the bookman. Their Uncle Moe had a bookshop, which A.S.W. took over. A.S.W. Rosenbach thought that American scholars should not have to travel to great European libraries to pursue their research, so he started to buy works for resale to collectors and collections. Rosenbach Co. had branches in Manhattan and Philadelphia and, for the first half of the 20th century, was this country's most important purveyor of books and manuscripts. Today the museum occupies adjacent townhouses, the second purchased in 1993 to augment exhibition space. It is filled with mostly 18th-century English and American furniture and portraits, plus such miscellaneous pieces as King Charles II's
document chest, Herman Melville's
bookcase, Robert Burns's
powder horn and Lord Byron's
calling-card case. It is the library holdings that truly astonish. The Americana begins with materials from the age of discovery: letters of Hernán Cortés
and Francisco Pizarro
; the first books printed in this hemisphere, in Mexico (1543) and Peru (1584); and the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in the American colonies (Cambridge, 1661). Among the British works: early editions and manuscripts of Chaucer, a rare first edition of John Bunyan's
"Pilgrim's Progress"; the largest collection of Robert Burns outside Edinburgh; Charles Dickens's
manuscripts of "Pickwick Papers" and "Nicholas Nickleby." The list goes on. Pride of place belongs to the manuscript of James Joyce's
"Ulysses" (purchased in 1924), and to 80% of Joseph Conrad's
manuscripts (the bulk of which was purchased in 1923). Most prominently and popularly displayed are the the works of two artists who knew each other: Marianne Moore and Maurice Sendak. The great American poet died in 1972. Sendak, her neighbor in Greenwich Village, had persuaded her to sell her papers to the Rosenbach, which she did on the condition that it also install the parlor of her apartment in the library. And here we have it: her furniture; her animal figurines and works of art; her typewriter; her baseballs signed by Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle, as well as an exercise bar hanging over a closet door. The museum is now celebrating Sendak himself, who died earlier this year, with a display of paintings, illustrations and editions from throughout his long career. He began giving things to the Rosenbach in 1968; it now holds more than 10,000 of Sendak's items. In a downstairs gallery we find original drawings from the best-selling "Where the Wild Things Are" and "The Night Kitchen," as well as Sendak's pen-and-ink illustrations of I.B. Singer
stories and etchings for William Blake's
"Songs of Innocence." The Sendak display continues through May 26, 2013. In another downstairs parlor there's a framed letter to A.S.W. Rosenbach from Harry Elkins
Widener, dated March 19, 1912, from London. Four weeks later young Harry set sail. On the Titanic. He was the one who put Rosenbach on the map. He patronized the bookstore and began collecting. After his death, his mother endowed, in his memory and name, Harvard's encyclopedic library. A.S.W. Rosenbach was the agent for all this. He also managed collections for what became the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington and the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif. Closer to home, he developed a long personal and professional relationship with Lessing Rosenwald, the Sears Roebuck magnate from Chicago who moved to Philadelphia and assembled a great collection that went ultimately to the Library of Congress and the National Gallery of Art. On the crisp fall day I visited, a docent gave a tour to me and two suburban ladies, one an aspiring memoirist enrolled in a creative-writing program on Philadelphia's Main Line. As we finished, another quartet of tourists wandered in. Upstairs in the library, a Japanese scholar pored over Joyce materials, and a married couple in town for an academic conference had just rushed in from the airport to see a letter of Moore's. Another Moore aficionado—also a nascent poet—came to pay her homage. Intimacy and informality prevailed. To handle scholarly materials, the Rosenbach requires not the usual white gloves demanded by other libraries but a good old-fashioned hand-washing (latex can do more damage to delicate paper than clean, oil-free hands). I couldn't resist asking to see and touch one piece that stopped my heart and brought tears to my professorial eyes. It was the manuscript whose purchase got A.S.W. Rosenbach started on the final, and greatest, chapter of his buying career. In London in 1885 Sotheby's had sold at auction the manuscripts of six letters of John Keats.
Oscar Wilde,
enraged by the salacious intermingling of art and commerce, wrote a protest sonnet. Thirty-five years later, at Manhattan's Anderson Galleries, Rosenbach bought the poet's penultimate letter to Fanny Brawne, his fiancée, dated July 5, 1820, before his departure for Italy, where he died of tuberculosis seven months later. The great poet was also a typical, temperamental 24-year-old young man who, finding his girlfriend flirting with his roommate, wrote to her with envy, jealousy, rage and sadness, "I will resent my heart having been made a football." I couldn't put a price on the letter. Mr. Spiegelman, editor-in-chief of the Southwest Review, grew up in Philadelphia. Email

WASHINGTON—The bipartisan deficit-reduction talks led by Vice President Joe Biden grew more contentious Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans became increasingly entrenched on key issues, people familiar with the matter said. Republicans are staunchly opposed to raising taxes, something Democrats believe must be part of any deficit-reduction plan. Many Democrats, meanwhile, oppose certain changes to entitlement programs like Medicare, but Republicans say these are the biggest drivers of the deficit and must be tackled. Journal Community President Barack Obama plans to meet with top House Democrats Thursday about the talks. One question negotiators face is how quickly to implement spending cuts or tax increases that might be part of any plan. Separate warnings that U.S. policy makers could hurt the weak American economic recovery if they adopted immediate federal spending cuts came Wednesday from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a news conference, and the Congressional Budget Office, in a new report. Some described the tension between the budget negotiators as expected, given they're working through some of the most controversial issues involved, and talks are due to wrap up soon. Others said the intensifying differences are adding complexity to the talks and portend difficult discussions ahead. The Biden talks seek to clear the way for lawmakers to vote to raise the $14.29 trillion federal borrowing limit by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials say that is when the government will run out of cash to pay its bills if the debt cap isn't lifted. Vice President Joe Biden
Getty Images Many Republicans have said they wouldn't vote to raise the debt ceiling under any circumstances, and numerous lawmakers have said they would only vote to raise the ceiling if a deficit-reduction plan is in place. If negotiators hit a wall and talks appear to be faltering in the coming weeks, investors could begin to question whether the debt ceiling will be raised in time—which could lead to market turbulence. Both sides plan to continue talking Thursday. The White House and congressional Republicans have locked horns before in spending talks and found a way to reconcile differences at the last minute, such as when they worked out a deal several months ago to continue funding the federal government's operations. The hardening disagreements have been telegraphed for weeks in public statements, but became more entrenched than some expected during the private talks in recent days. Since early May, Mr. Biden has led a group of administration officials and lawmakers through roughly a dozen meetings to lay the groundwork for a final deal. The group has been careful not to leak details of the talks, worried that could lead to the discussions imploding. They planned on handing off their work soon to a more senior group of negotiators, likely led by Mr. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio). More MarketBeat: Legalize Pot, Fix the Budget? One unresolved issue is the size of the deficit-reduction package that negotiators will aim for. White House officials, including Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, have said a deficit-reduction plan should reduce the projected budget deficit by $4 trillion to $5 trillion over 10 years, but they say the deal must include certain tax increases paired with spending cuts. Republicans have said they will insist on a dollar in deficit reduction for every dollar that the debt ceiling is raised. Many analysts believe this means there will have to be a $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion package, as that is roughly the amount of money in additional borrowing the Treasury Department will need to carry it past the 2012 elections. The CBO, which is Congress's nonpartisan research arm, said in its report that the large U.S. budget deficits being debated in Washington would "probably decline markedly" over the next several years as the economy recovers and government measures to stimulate growth—such as temporary tax breaks and spending programs—run out. But it projected long-term deficits expanding rapidly beyond that as a result of the rising costs of Medicare and other government health programs as the U.S. population ages. "The budget outlook, for both the coming decade and beyond, is daunting," it said. —Luca DiLeo and Michael R. Crittenden contributed to this article.

If the rich can be taxed at a different rate, why not other differences in how they are taxed?
Scott Adams The president was too polite to mention it during his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, but here's a quick summary of the problem: The U.S. is broke. The hole is too big to plug with cost cutting or economic growth alone. Rich people have money. No one else does. Rich people have enough clout to block higher taxes on themselves, and they will. Likely outcome: Your next home will be the box that your laser printer came in. I hope that you kept it. Whenever I feel as if I'm on a path toward certain doom, which happens every time I pay attention to the news, I like to imagine that some lonely genius will come up with a clever solution to save the world. Imagination is a wonderful thing. I don't have much control over the big realities, such as the economy, but I'm an expert at programming my own delusions. I make no apology for that. A well-crafted delusion can be a delicious guilty pleasure. And best of all, it's totally free. As a public service, today I will teach you how to wrap yourself in a warm blanket of imagined solutions for the government's fiscal dilemma. More Weigh In: Scott Adams Takes Your Questions on How to Tax the Rich Soaking the Wealthy: An American Tradition To begin, assume that as the fiscal meltdown becomes more perilous, everyone will become more flexible and perhaps a bit more open-minded. That seems reasonable enough. A good crisis has a way of changing people. Now imagine that the world needs just one great idea to put things back on the right track. Great ideas have often changed history. It's not hard to imagine it can happen again. Try to imagine that the idea that saves the country is an entirely new one. It's too much of a stretch to imagine that a stale idea would suddenly become acceptable. In fact, that's the dividing line between imagination and insanity. Only crazy people imagine that bad ideas can suddenly become good if you keep trying them. So let's assume that our imagined solution is a brand new idea. That feels less crazy and more optimistic. Another advantage is that no one has an entrenched view about an idea that has never been heard. Enlarge Image
Scott Adams For those of you with healthy egos—and that would be every reader of The Wall Street Journal—you can make this fantasy extra delicious by imagining that you are the person who comes up with the idea that saves the world. I'll show you how to imagine that. I think you'll be surprised at how easy it is. I spent some time working in the television industry, and I learned a technique that writers use. It's called "the bad version." When you feel that a plot solution exists, but you can't yet imagine it, you describe instead a bad version that has no purpose other than stimulating the other writers to imagine a better version. VOTE You added your ideas on how to tax the rich in the comments. Now, vote on the most recommended ideas. Mr. Adams will discuss the best suggestions on the Ideas Market blog .
For example, if your character is stuck on an island, the bad version of his escape might involve monkeys crafting a helicopter out of palm fronds and coconuts. That story idea is obviously bad, but it might stimulate you to think in terms of other engineering solutions, or other monkey-related solutions. The first step in thinking of an idea that will work is to stop fixating on ideas that won't. The bad version of an idea moves your mind to a new vantage point. With that technique in mind, I will describe some bad versions of how society might go about the job of convincing the rich to accept higher taxes on themselves. But first I need to address the illusion of fairness. We like to think that fairness is an objective condition. If you and a friend simultaneously find a dollar on the street, fairness suggests that you split it. But what if your friend is a billionaire and you are starving? Is it still fair to split the dollar? And what if you and your friend noticed the dollar at the same time but your friend was quicker to pick it up? Does that count for anything? More From Ideas Market At Davos, the Fine Art of Getting Snowed A Cascade of Revolution? In reality, fairness is not so much about the actual distribution of loot as it is about the psychology of how you feel about it. That's important to understand because the rich won't give up their cash unless they feel they are getting something in return. And so far, saving the country doesn't seem to be enough of a payoff. If we accept that the rich can be taxed at a different rate than everyone else, we can also imagine that there could be other differences in how the rich are taxed. That's the part we can tinker with, and that's where the bad version comes in. In a minute, I'll float some bad ideas about how the rich can feel good while the rest of society is rifling through their pockets. I can think of five benefits that the country could offer to the rich in return for higher taxes: time, gratitude, incentives, shared pain and power. Time. It's useful to keep in mind how the rich are different. When you are poor, you are willing to trade your time to earn money. When you are rich, you trade your money to get more time. For example, the rich hire people to clean their homes, and they don't waste time shopping for bargains. In business school I learned that when people have different preferences, you can usually find a way to engineer a deal. Suppose we change the tax code so that in return for higher taxes on the rich, we figure out a way to give the rich some form of extra time. The bad version is that anyone who pays taxes at a rate above some set amount gets to use the car pool lane without a passenger. Or perhaps the rich are allowed to park in handicapped-only spaces. Ridiculous, you cry! Remember, this is the bad version. And if the rich are only a tiny percentage of the population, they would have almost no impact on the traffic in car pool lanes or the availability of parking spaces for the handicapped. You wouldn't even notice the difference. You could imagine a host of ways the government could trade time for money. Suppose all government agencies had a mandate to handle the affairs of the rich before everyone else. You wouldn't even notice that your wait at the Department of Motor Vehicles was 2% longer. As a bonus, what happens to the economy when the people who are most skilled at making money suddenly have extra time? My bet is that they stimulate the economy by spending more or by earning more. Gratitude. Imagine that the government arranges to provide genuine person-to-person gratitude to the rich in exchange for higher tax rates. Suppose (bad idea alert) the government makes it a condition that anyone applying for social services has to write a personal thank-you note to a nearby rich person who, according to a central database, hasn't lately received one. Gratitude goes a long way. It's easy to hate the generic overspending of the government. It's harder to begrudge medical care to someone who thanks you personally. It's a bad idea, I know. Don't judge it. Just let it nudge your imagination to someplace better. Incentives. Another approach, also a bad idea, might be to treat the rich more like venture capitalists than sources of free money. Suppose the tax code is redesigned so that the rich only pay taxes to fund social services, such as health care and social security. This gives the rich an incentive to find ways to reduce the need for those services, which would in turn keep their taxes under control. Perhaps you'd see an explosion of private investment in technologies that make it less expensive to provide health care. You might see rapid advances in bringing down the cost of housing for seniors. Meanwhile, the middle class would be in charge of funding the military. That feels right. The country generally doesn't go to war unless the middle-class majority is on board. Shared Pain. Happiness is a relative thing. That's how humans are wired. And we're just screwed up enough to feel comfort when our pain is shared. So how can we make the overtaxed rich feel as if the rest of society is feeling a little extra pain? Here's a time-tested way to do this. It's called "titles of nobility." Who wouldn't want to be the Duke of Cleveland, the Prince of Mississippi, Lord Seattle, or the Earl of Omaha? —Steve Gustafson
I doubt that the rich will agree to higher taxes until some serious budget cutting is happening at the same time. That makes the sacrifice seem shared. The rich will feel unfairly singled out unless everyone is taking a hit. And budget cuts make the government seem better managed. That matters. The bad idea here is to change the debate from arguing about which programs and how much to cut, and instead to do what the private sector has been doing for decades: Pull a random yet round number out of your ear, let's say a 10% cut, just for argument's sake, and apply it across the board. No exceptions. Everything from the military to welfare to federal pensions to government salaries would take the same hit. Managers in the private sector have been handling budget cuts this way for years. They know that their subordinates are all professional liars, so there is no reliable information for making cuts in a more reasoned way. They also know that any project can get by with 10% less money if there is no alternative. Power. Everyone loves power. I'm guessing that the rich like it more than most people, on average. Another bad idea is to give the rich two votes apiece in any election. That's double the power of other citizens. But don't worry that it will distort election results. There aren't that many rich people, and they are somewhat divided in their opinions, just like the rest of the world. And realistically, is the candidate who gets 51% of the vote always better than the one who gets only 49%? That's a risk I'll take. I think I've given you enough bad ideas to prime your imagination. Now it's your turn. If you think that solving the nation's fiscal problems is the job of elected officials, you have to ask yourself how that's working so far. The solution, if it exists, won't be anything that looks like normal business. The rich have the money, and they aren't going to give it up for nothing. I know because I am one, and yes, we do hold meetings. The way our political system is designed, politicians are not free to float bad ideas. Doing so is a sure way to lose an election. Politicians aren't even free to support good ideas if they are too far from the norm. But as citizens, we're free to speculate all we want. And if some new and better idea gains popularity at the grassroots level, our elected leaders would then be able to embrace it. In other words, it's literally your job to fix the budget problem because your government isn't equipped to handle it. The ideas I've mentioned here are bad by design. But if a few million people start brainstorming their own ideas for solving the debt problem, someone might come up with a winner. And if that idea gains popular support on the Internet, it frees politicians to consider it. I have no problem imagining that something along those lines can happen, and the thought feels delightful. —Mr. Adams is the creator of "Dilbert." Infernal Revenue: Unusual Taxes in History
Taxation has been around since at least 3000 B.C., when Egyptian pharaohs taxed many items. Getty Images Taxation has been around since at least 3000 B.C., when Egyptian pharaohs taxed many items, including grain, imported goods, livestock and beer. Enlarge Image
Citizens had to pay a tax on cooking oil, and tax collectors searched homes for used oil. Getty Images. Citizens also had to pay a tax on cooking oil, and tax collectors (known as scribes) searched homes for used oil, trying to make sure that everyone was using new cooking oil—and thus paying the tax. As part of his drive to modernize Russia—and to spur Russian men to look more like clean-shaven European men—Peter the Great introduced a beard tax in 1705. One of the grievances that fueled the French Revolution of 1789 was the salt tax.Getty Images Any man who wanted to wear a beard, with the exception of priests and peasants, had to pay a tax of as much as 900 rubles. He then had to wear a special medallion around his neck as proof of payment. One of the grievances that fueled the French Revolution of 1789 was the salt tax, also called the gabelle. The tax varied by region, and in some areas, residents also had to buy a minimum amount of salt. The result: lots of smuggling and unrest. In India, the British salt tax became a focus of Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent protest against English rule. Enlarge Image
The window tax was enacted in England in 1696 after the short-lived hearth tax on fireplaces. Masterfile Enacted in England in 1696 after the short-lived hearth tax on fireplaces, the window tax was based on the number of windows in a house. (That made assessments easier, since windows, unlike hearths, could be counted from the outside.) Many chose to block some of their windows to pay a lower fee. The tax was eventually repealed in 1851, on public health grounds. Following similar laws in other states, Tennessee passed the "crack tax" in 2005, which mandated that drug dealers pay taxes anonymously on illegal substances. If a dealer was caught without proof of payment, the state collected taxes, with penalties. Around 3,000 people were eligible for refunds after the law was struck down in 2009; a revised law soon followed. In Alabama, computer solitaire has one advantage: Anyone buying a deck of playing cards there must pay a 10-cent tax. (And retailers must obtain a "playing card privilege license.") Other states and cities have their own special charges. Maine has a blueberry tax, New York City taxes sliced (but not whole) bagels, and Minnesota has a fur clothing tax.

Diocese Sent Priests to Church-Run Center for Treatment By
Jennifer Levitz
Feb. 2, 2013 1:26 p.m. ET
The thicket of personnel files released Thursday night by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles showed that several of its priests accused of sexual abuse were sent to New Mexico in the mid-1980s for psychological treatment. The Servants of Paraclete treatment center in Jemez Springs, N.M., about 60 miles north of Albuquerque, served clergy who had problems such as alcoholism, emotional disorders, or, increasingly from the 1970s on, priests who had been accused of sexual abuse, said Thomas Plante, a psychology...

Fed's Bond Buys Aren't Near Problem Level, Official Says

Jon Hilsenrath

John Williams, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank and one of the Fed's stronger advocates for continuing to use monetary policy to bolster the economy, said the central bank's securities portfolio hasn't grown "anywhere near" the kind of limits that might impede the Fed from carrying on with its bond-buying programs.

Updated March 17, 2006 11:59 p.m. ET
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.) "The Evidence," ABC's new crime drama, deserves an award for packing the most intrigue into a first episode (Wednesday, 10-11 p.m. ET). I'm not talking about the plot, which unravels in a satisfying way, but the regular cast. It doesn't happen very often that halfway into the pilot for a new show, you're already looking forward to subsequent episodes just to find out more about the characters you've glimpsed in the first few minutes. In this case, the objects of fascination not only include the two main detective partners -- a serious Rob Estes and a laid-back Orlando Jones, playing perfectly off each other on the streets of San Francisco. Even the people who make relatively brief appearances leave you wanting to know more about them, e.g., Martin Landau as a slightly spooky forensic lab chief. And what about his gorgeous British assistant, or the beat cop who looks like a vampire with her hair down and seems to have a thing for one of the detectives? What makes them tick and what will they get up to down the road? If the first episode is any indication, solving each week's case will always be a trip, too. The show's opening device includes Mr. Landau in voice-over, introducing a victim and reviewing the evidence with which the detectives will begin. This week, it's the body of a dead medical student, Laura Green, and several possible clues, like her cellphone, a locket and a severed finger with a tiny compass ring on it. With that on the table, we, the audience, join the crime solvers as they attempt to put the pieces together. As entertaining as that is, if "The Evidence" is a hit, this may be largely due to the chemistry between Rob Estes and Orlando Jones. The former, with his severe Lance Armstrong-style haircut, has a tragedy in his past -- a murdered wife -- which gives his character instant texture and depth, even when he's playing pranks on his partner. Mr. Jones's detective seems like the light-hearted part of the pair, and it falls to him to yank his partner back toward the light. But beneath the goofing around, he's an adult, too. In a scene at the end of the pilot, a bedridden Mr. Jones wolfs down a forbidden sandwich, smearing his face in the process. It's funny, but also touching because we have by now glimpsed a man in full bloom, and the more vulnerable he looks, the more we are reminded of how strong he is. All that in less than an hour. Amazing. The marvelous British actor Bill Nighy plays a man at the height of his powers in the television movie "Gideon's Daughter." (BBC America; due to a schedule change, now scheduled to debut on Saturday, March 25 from 8-10:15 p.m.) But the bloom is off his particular career rose. His character, Gideon Warner, is London's premier PR magician, sought after by show-business celebrities, government leaders and foreign media moguls who want guidance and image shaping from the maestro. This has made Gideon rich and famous, thronged everywhere he goes by powerful people eager to catch pearls of PR wisdom that seem to pour from his lips. Only Gideon is tired and bored and, worst of all, he feels like a Chauncey Gardiner -- the false seer of "Being There" -- with the added burden of knowing that the more people take him seriously, the more ridiculous both he and they are. Without moving a muscle, Mr. Nighy oozes elegant ennui. He also exudes a sadness so profound that it's palpable, especially after he attends a school-graduation performance by his college-bound daughter, Natasha (Emily Blunt). who warbles a haunting song about obsessive love and suicide. Things have gone irreparably wrong between father and beautiful daughter over the years, and in Gideon's mind is an overwhelming emotion that every parent will recognize: the fear that he will suffer the ultimate punishment of losing his child through death. Which bring us to the third element in this story, which concerns a pair of London parents whose son died in a traffic accident. Sorrow has driven the father mad. And the boy's mother, the now-divorced Stella (Miranda Richardson) is consumed by a grief greater than Gideon's, since his child is at least still living. Yet Stella has got some spark of life that draws Gideon to her in ways that may yet save them both. This is a movie that moves in mysterious ways, not with bangs or whimpers, but through an accumulation of tender sorrows that are never mawkish and eventually give way to glimmers of joy. For Mr. Nighy, it's a role far removed from the over-the-hill rock singer he played to such hilarious effect in "Love Actually." And then again, it isn't, because in both cases, the whole world outside seems to stop spinning whenever he's on screen. And now for something completely different, albeit also on BBC America. Starting tonight, 9-9:40 p.m., treat yourself to "High Spirits With Shirley Ghostman," the British psychic who communes with dead celebrities and holds the record for giving the most readings -- 22 -- in a single minute. It's all completely fake, of course, but not in the way of other psychic frauds. Shirley Ghostman is actually the comedian Marc Wootton who, in the manner of faux gangsta-journalist Ali G, impersonates a medium before an audience of people who have no idea that it's a joke. Goodness knows, they should. Each week, the lisping Mr. Ghostman, clad in a frilly white suit and sporting a blond mullet, starts his stage show -- set in a church -- by introducing the audience to his psychic helper, Sheba, a German shepherd. The sight of Sheba, whose picture is projected onto the wall of the church, ought to be enough to give the game away at the start, and some in the audience do smile. But nothing Mr. Ghostman does seems to entirely shatter the belief of the sort of people who would come to hear a psychic in the first place. Not even his readings directed at individual members of the crowd. When he looks at one and says, "You deserved that holiday, how were you supposed to know that dogs can't feed themselves?" the recipient looks stunned, even embarrassed, but not incredulous. Later in the show, a huffing and puffing Shirley suddenly channels a familiar spirit: "Hello, I am Lady Di, what died. I am coming to you from the other world, which I rule with my dear husband... Dodi Fayed. Thanks for the funeral, although I must tell you that the journey to Westminster Abbey was a little bit slow." When the camera cuts to members of the audience, some are trying not to giggle and some look like they are crying. Sure enough, even a finale that includes ghost images of Diana and Hitler playing rock music doesn't seem to have alerted some true believers in the audience to the enormity of the scam. In another segment of the program, Mr. Wootton is seen visiting a woman who appears to be a real "rumpologist," making a living reading people's bare backsides. In future episodes, Mr. Wootton will pose as a Polish rat catcher who now catches ghosts instead -- and some people might fall for that, too. All the more hilarious since right after "Shirley" ends on BBC America tonight, the WE channel is offering "John Edward Cross Country" (10-11 p.m.) featuring the stylings of a psychic who isn't trying to be funny at all, but whose basic gimmicks are eerily similar to Mr. Ghostman's. "Hollywood Science: Car Chases" (Sunday, 9-10 p.m.) reviews some of the movies' most-famous car capers and crashes -- from "Bullitt" and "The French Connection" to "Speed" and "The Fast and the Furious" -- and explains the laws of physics that were bent or broken to get them made. Fascinating stuff, especially when a design engineer reveals how hard it really is to make a car explode. Corrections & Amplifications: In this article, the network that will run "Hollywood Science: Car Chases" was omitted. It will air on the National Geographic Channel on Sunday at 9 p.m.
