Review | Dates to Watch For | Follow-Up | U.S. Economic Calendar | Consensus Estimates | Coming Earnings | Coming U.S. Auctions Wall Street typically favors Republicans, but there is no denying the stock market's splendid performance under the Democrat-in-chief, President Barack Obama. Potus might wag his finger at fat-cat capitalists, but most equity portfolios have grown chunkier during Obama's first 1,505 days in office. The Standard & Poor's 500 has enjoyed its best return for any presidential period going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower, says Richard Peterson, director, S&P Capital IQ. From Obama's first inaugural on Jan. 20, 2009, through last Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 91.2%. Only Bill Clinton came close to Obama's record for his first 1,505 days in office, with an 85.1% market return. Enlarge Image
Rich One: Under a president who decries fat cats, the stock market's 91% advance is making many Americans fatter.
William Waitzman for Barron's To be sure, Obama took office during the depths of the financial crisis, when the market was swooning. Come to think of it, the president very nearly called the bottom four years ago, when he suggested during a news conference with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on March 5, 2009, that it was a good time to buy stocks. The S&P 500 closed that day at 682.55, and the market bottomed four days later. Late last week, it was at 1544, about 1.5% below its 2007 high. Some might credit the market's romp to the president's profligate spending, or the Federal Reserve's ultralow interest-rate policies, which helped stoke a stampede into riskier assets. Corporate America's improved financial health also deserves much of the credit. In any case, if the market keeps rising at its current pace, it will double by the time the president leaves office. -- Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal Next Week: Preview Monday 11 Dick's Sporting Goods is expected to post strong earnings for the fourth quarter.
