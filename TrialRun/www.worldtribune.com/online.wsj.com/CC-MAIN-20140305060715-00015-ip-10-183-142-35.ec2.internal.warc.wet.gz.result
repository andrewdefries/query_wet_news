   By Tom Murphy and Rogerio Jelmayer 
 SAO PAULO--Brazil's largest state of Sao Paulo on Monday froze all highway tolls at current levels until July 2014, a decision taken by Gov. Geraldo Alckmin following weeks of protests focused, in large part, on the high cost of transportation. Despite the climate of protest, Mr. Alckmin said that "this is not a populist measure. We've been working on this problem for the past two years." The governor spoke at a news conference. The decision covers both government-run highways and roads given over to private concessions through a series of auctions dating back to the 1990s. Mr. Alckmin said, "The decision was within terms of the concession contracts." He admitted that concession-holders were being hurt by the measure but said the freeze on tolls was a "penalty" being paid by the companies for delays in investments mandated by the original contracts. More broadly, Mr. Alckmin praised recent street protests as "an important exercise in democracy." Protests, which have now become nationwide, began in Sao Paulo early in June. Demonstrators were demanding a rollback in a 7% hike in bus fares in the city of Sao Paulo. City Mayor Fernando Haddad backed down on the 7% hike in the face of the protests. Mr. Alckmin, along with other governors and several big-city mayors, will meet with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia later Monday to discuss transportation costs and other issues raised by protesters. He said political reform was a high priority for him and several other governors. "Brazilian politics has become prone to deal-making and that cannot be allowed to continue," he said. He said he was "open to dialogue" with the president. President Rousseff was elected in 2010 as the nominee of the Workers' Party. Mr. Alckmin is a member of Brazil's main opposition party, the Social Democrats. Mr. Alckmin was his party's presidential nominee in 2006, losing to popular former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. A number of political reforms are currently before Brazil's congress. Reforms aim at increasing the role of public financing of elections, reducing the number of political parties and making members of congress more accountable to voters.

In a session that took less than an hour at the state capitol in Olympia, the three-member board unanimously approved a host of regulations covering pot production, processing and retailing. Among the rules: Two million square feet will be allowed statewide for marijuana cultivation, with a limit of 40 metric tons of...

The Lost Wages of Youth
Raising the minimum wage has put teens out of work. Updated March 5, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
There's plenty of competition, but our vote for the recent act of Congress that has caused the most economic hardship goes to the May 2007 law raising the minimum wage in three stages to $7.25 an hour from $5.15. Rarely has a law hurt more vulnerable people more quickly. A higher minimum wage has the biggest impact on those with the least experience or the fewest skills. That means in particular those looking for entry-level jobs, especially teenagers. And sure enough, as nearly all economic models predict, the higher...
