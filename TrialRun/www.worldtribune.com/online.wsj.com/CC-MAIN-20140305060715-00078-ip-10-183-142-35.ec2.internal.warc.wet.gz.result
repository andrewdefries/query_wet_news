Debt Ceiling
How do you feel about Obama's use of the constitutional phrase "the validity of the public debt shall not be questioned"? Are we obligated to continue to fund bloated government spending? When can we question it?

I'm an anarchist by inclination, so I carry no water for Obama. However, in this instance he is correct if viewed in a limited manner.The debt is for things done in the past. That should be paid for. Its the future that we have a right to question.

Ehhh ... what? We should pay our past debt but not our current bills? I don't get it. If we stop paying either of them, our credit line will vanish (or become vastly more expensive). You can declare all debts null and void, but that medicine is worse than the disease.Obama is reinterpreting established law and precedent because he considers it to be too restrictive. Well, it was written that way on purpose, to slow down would-be tyrants from doing exactly what he is doing. He is undermining the document he swore to protect - and he doesn't have the option to interpret it - that's SCOTUS' job.

A current bill IS a debt, isn't it (?) so you misinterpret my meaning.All bills, debt, whatever you want to call them that are current need to be paid. Future obligations that are as yet not bills, debts, etc need to be renegotiated or terminated. A new space program - terminated. New spending on Obamacare - terminated. Social Security - renegotiated and eventually terminated. Medicare/Medicaid - privatized and the gov't involvement terminated. FDA, FAA, Dept Ed - terminated. Gov't intrusions into the private sector - terminated.We should stop spending and stop incurring additional debts. Is that clear enough?

The statutory debt ceiling has already been reached, and the government is still taking on debt, which is not authorized by law. It is borrowing from government employee pension plans by not making payments to the funds as required; when Congress later raises the debt ceiling and those payments are retroactively paid, the government is paying back debt that was incurred without legal authorization. If those funds are not repaid, then the Treasury simply stopped spending as required by law. But that isn't what happens; the payments are made retroactively after the fact, which is debt repayment. Debt that was undertaken beyond authorization by law. That was not the only alternative. The government could have laid off employees, closed departments, sold assets. It chose instead to take on unauthorized additional debt.On what ethical basis do citizens obey a body of law that its own government ignores?

Not to be argumentative, but:"On what ethical basis do citizens obey a body of law that its own government ignores?"The one that says, "Don't do anything that might get you locked up."The government does all kinds of sh*it that would get private citizens arrested.And just so's it known, I'd originally said "cr*ap", and the WSJ nannybot didn't like that. So I "cleaned up" my language! >:-)

The debt ceiling should prevent Government from taking on NEW debt, not paying for past debt which the Government already has revenue from current sources to pay for.

The debt ceiling forces Government to at least look at spending, and puts it in the news. Without it the Pols. could just keep borrowing and spending more without review. Of course they seem to do that anyways.

The government "looks at" spending the way a welfare recipient "looks at" a job board -- i.e., with no real intent to change anything substantive.

The reality is that the government has enough money coming in every day to pay the debts that are obligatory as stated in the 14th amendment. There are no other obligatory debts stated in the Constitution or its amendments. Even Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, our entitlements, offer no promise of repayment.

The government could easily make payments on debt without increasing it. They'd just have to cut programs Obama doesn't want to cut, like Medicaid.

So does anyone think that Obama is using the 14th Amendment to hold us hostage? In other words, we are forced to borrow more in order to pay for past obligations because of the 14th Amendment. But can't we still acknowledge the validity of the public debt while also refusing to raise the debt ceiling? Forcing the government into a PAYGO mode of existence doesn't mean we are questioning the validity of past debts; it just means we refuse to borrow more in order to pay for it.

After years spent trying to shield students from online bullying by their peers, schools are beginning to crack down on Internet postings that disparage teachers. Schools elsewhere in the U.S. have punished the occasional tweeter who hurls an insult at a teacher, but North Carolina has taken it a step further, making it a crime for students to post statements via the Internet that "intimidate or torment" faculty. Students convicted under the law could be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished with fines of as much as $1,000 and/or probation. The move is one of the most aggressive yet by states to police students' online activities. While officials have long had the ability to regulate student speech at school, the threat of cyberbullying teachers, which typically occurs off-campus, has prompted efforts to restrain students' use of the Internet on their own time. Enlarge Image
Judy Kidd, a Charlotte, N.C., teacher said teachers needed a law for 'protection' from online comments.
Andy McMillan for The Wall Street Journal School officials in North Carolina and elsewhere say the moves are necessary to protect teachers in an age when comments posted online—sometimes by students pretending to be the teachers they are mocking—can spread quickly and damage reputations. The North Carolina law makes it a crime for a student to "build a fake profile or web site" with the "intent to intimidate or torment a school employee." Critics, however, argue the law risks trampling on mere venting and other less inflammatory forms of expression. "Our concern is that we don't throw the First Amendment out the window in our haste to get the kid who is calling the principal bad names on Facebook," said Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center in Arlington, Va., a national group that advocates for students' free-speech rights. Traditional issues of free speech on public-school grounds are largely settled, thanks to a 1969 Supreme Court ruling in Tinker v. Des Moines. That ruling held that students' First Amendment rights are generally protected on campus, but that administrators can punish them for speech on school grounds when they can clearly show it caused significant disruption to school activities or violated others' rights. But while past off-campus insults about a school employee were largely undetected and unpunished, cyberinsults are digitally preserved and on display for many to see. The wide use of social media, particular among teens, makes such platforms the go-to place for such incendiary comments. While nearly every U.S. state has now passed measures to curb student-on-student cyberbullying, North Carolina is apparently the first to pass a law aimed at students bullying teachers online. Courts have been mixed on the issue. Last year, the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in two separate decisions, said two schools, both in Pennsylvania, had encroached on students' free-speech rights by punishing them for creating social media profiles mocking their school principals. The court held that the students' parodies, which were created off-campus, didn't significantly disrupt the schools. Enlarge Image
Student Avery Doninger, in 2007, was at the center of a case about a comment she made on a blog.
Associated Press School Rules Under a new law, North Carolina students face a fine of as much as $1,000 and/or probation if they: Build a fake profile of… Post a real or fake image of… Post information about… Or repeatedly contact… …school employees, including teachers
In one case, Justin Layshock, a high-school student, mocked his principal in a Myspace profile parody, writing, among other things, that the principal was "too drunk to remember" his own birthday. In the other case, a middle-school student identified in court documents only by initials J.S. created a Myspace page to make fun of her school principal. using his photo and including among his general interests: "hitting on students and their parents." Yet in a separate case in Connecticut last year, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found administrators were within the law when they disciplined Avery Doninger, a high-school student, for posting a message to her blog encouraging people to call school officials a profanity in order to protest the school's "jamfest" being canceled. Even though Ms. Doninger wrote the post off campus, the court held that it created a substantial disturbance at school to warrant a punishment. Mr. Layshock and Ms. Doninger, whose cases garnered national attention, have gone on to graduate from college, attorneys for them said. In the past year, the U.S. Supreme Court has turned down opportunities to hear those three cases, as well as a fourth about student speech, which might have brought some clarity. In the fourth case, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it permissible for administrators in West Virginia to suspend a student who had created a Myspace page ridiculing another student. The Classroom Teachers Association of North Carolina l based in Charlotte, lobbied for the teacher-bullying provisions to be included in the state's School Violence Prevention Act of 2012 after fielding complaints about students using social media sites and email to make false accusations about school employees, said Judy Kidd, the group's president. In one case Ms. Kidd cited, a sixth-grader sent sexually explicit emails about a teacher to other students. In another, a high-school student posted false allegations on Facebook that an instructor for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps had groped her while fitting her for a uniform. "It became apparent that we had to get some kind of protection," said Ms. Kidd, a high-school science teacher in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. Some free-speech advocates say the North Carolina law gives administrators wide latitude to go after students and possibly infringe on free speech. They say the law, which was passed in July, could be enforced against students who are making truthful statements or posting undoctored photos of staff. Thomas Wheeler, an Indiana lawyer who represents school districts, said he hoped a case will be heard by the Supreme Court and result in clear guidance from the justices on how far schools can go to police what students say online and on social media sites. "The times have changed and we are trying to get caught up," he said. Write to Steve Eder at steve.eder@wsj.com Email

Low Rates Force Companies to Pour Cash Into Pensions
By
Mike Ramsey and Vipal Monga Feb. 3, 2013 11:00 p.m. ET
Ford Motor Co. expects to spend $5 billion this year shoring up its pension funds, almost as much as the auto maker spent last year building plants, buying equipment and developing new cars. The nation's second-largest auto maker is one of a who's who of U.S. companies pouring cash into pension plans now being battered by record low interest rates. Verizon Communications Inc. contributed $1.7 billion to its pension plan in the...

Updated Jan. 22, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
Betsy and Jarom Schow agree that the biggest problem they've faced in 12 years of marriage isn't money, sex or parenting. It's weight. Ms. Schow, 31 years old, was heavy for much of her life. When she was growing up, her family ate a lot of processed foods and takeout, and she rarely exercised, she recalls. In school, children "mooed" at her when she walked by. She started her first diet at age 12. When one partner is overweight, resolving relationship conflict takes two. WSJ "Bonds" columnist Elizabeth Bernstein joins Lunch Break with a look at the latest reasearch. Betsy and Jarom Schow discuss their personal struggles with weight and marriage. Photo: Chad Hurst for The Wall Street Journal.
She met her future husband in college, in what she calls "a skinny period." Mr. Schow, now 36 and a software engineer, was outdoorsy and thin. The two went on hiking, skiing and rock-climbing dates. Even so, by the time they married in 2000, Ms. Schow had put on 25 pounds. Every year, it seemed she would lose 25 pounds and gain 30 back. By the Schows' fifth wedding anniversary, Ms. Schow weighed 220 pounds. And she was very unhappy about it. Few subjects in a relationship are more difficult to talk about than one person's weight. Even people who aren't overweight can obsess about their appearance (sadly, these mostly tend to be women). How can a partner raise the issue with someone who is overweight without causing hurt or embarrassment? And how can an overweight person address his or her weight problem without obsessing and harming the relationship? Touchy Topic Enlarge Image
The Schows, who live in Alpine, Utah, stopped doing fun things together. When they went hiking, Ms. Schow would read a book at the trailhead, waiting for her husband to return. She stopped going to his parents' Sunday dinners because, surrounded by thin people, she felt embarrassed and judged. For several years, she and her husband slept in separate rooms because she felt anxious and uncomfortable in her body, and had trouble sleeping. There were arguments. More than once, Mr. Schow asked his wife to change her outfit, saying, "That's not made for someone your size, Sweetheart." And there was the unforgettable occasion when Ms. Schow, "trying to spice things up in the bedroom," did a playful little dance, naked, she recalls. Her husband told her, "I guess you are one of those people who looks better with clothes on." (He apologized immediately but she still didn't speak to him for a week.) Today, Mr. Schow says he has "no idea" why he blurted out such a thing. "I haven't lived it down yet," he says. He never found his wife unattractive, Mr. Schow says, but after she lost 75 pounds, and kept the weight off, he did feel more attracted to her. Mixed-weight couples, where one partner is overweight and the other one isn't, have more relationship conflict, including arguments and feelings of anger and resentfulness, than same-weight couples, according to a study by researchers at the University of Puget Sound, in Tacoma, Wash., and the University of Arizona, in Tucson, published last month in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. Of 43 heterosexual couples in the study, those who reported the most conflict were a healthy-weight man and an overweight woman. When just the man was overweight, couples reported no more conflict than same-weight couples. The researchers said they don't know whether a weight difference caused couples to argue more, or whether conflict caused one partner to eat more and become overweight. Couples had less conflict when the overweight person reported feeling the partner was supportive of their efforts to exercise and eat a healthy diet. "That is significant because even though they are at risk for more conflict, there are communication mechanisms that can reduce this," says Tricia Burke, the study's lead author and visiting assistant professor in the communication studies department at the University of Puget Sound. Another finding: Mixed-weight couples who ate together frequently reported more conflict than those who seldom ate together. Ms. Schow recalls she would ask her husband to help her stick to her diet. Yet when he encouraged her to eat something healthy, she would accuse him of implying she was fat. "I was extremely frustrated," Mr. Schow recalls. "It felt like I was just saying the same things over and over, and we were stuck in this loop." After they argued, Mr. Schow often left the house or hid in his room. His wife's deep unhappiness magnified their other problems, he says, whether it was money or how much time they spent together. He also worried about what her attempts at extreme dieting would do to her health. The couple stopped having sex. Ms. Schow says she felt too self-conscious. "I would try and help her feel better about herself, telling her, 'You are beautiful the way you are,' " Mr. Schow says. He began to wonder: "If she doesn't want to have sex with me, what's wrong with me?" One night, Ms. Schow told her husband she wanted a divorce. "The weight caused a rift that just kept growing," she says. Experts say it is imperative for couples to communicate in a loving way when one partner has a weight problem. Catherine Hastings, a marriage and family therapist in Lancaster, Pa., says a person who isn't overweight should address the issue with an overweight partner "in a way that makes them feel that you are rooting for them. The worst thing is when you are teasing or nagging or judging." A spouse should say things that demonstrate support. The question "Are you really going to eat that?" doesn't demonstrate support. A healthy-weight partner should consider ways to show a willingness to team up to change behaviors. For example, the partner could ask the overweight loved-one for suggestions. Should you avoid keeping sweets in the house or skip dessert when dining out together? Almost everyone could stand to get more exercise and eat a more-healthy diet, and the healthy-weight partner can help by being a role model. The person who isn't overweight also should be aware of his or her own insecurities and possibly a subconscious need to sabotage the partner's weight-loss efforts. "The overall atmosphere should be, 'I love you and I want you to be around for as long as possible,' " Dr. Hastings says. After Ms. Schow raised the issue of divorce and was throwing clothes in a suitcase, she told her husband she wanted out because she felt trapped—in the marriage and her own misery. Mr. Schow calmly walked to the garage and let the air out of the tires of her jeep. "I felt that if I could calm her down and get her feeling better, we could work toward a resolution," he recalls. Ms. Schow didn't leave. But she did continue to complain about her weight. Then one night, as she was talking yet again how she was about packing on pounds, her husband said sleepily, "Turn off your thinker and go back to sleep." That seems, in hindsight, like the turning point, Ms. Schow says. She stopped the extreme dieting and concentrated on counting calories and getting exercise, eventually running four times a week and doing yoga and Zumba. After she lost 40 pounds, her husband told her that his dream was to run a marathon with her. They ran the Park City marathon together in August 2011. Ms. Schow lost 75 pounds in 10 months. The couple began hiking, biking and rock climbing again—and teaching their 3- and 6-year-old daughters to be active. Ms. Schow wrote a book about her experience, "Finished Being Fat," published earlier this month. The Schow's marriage improved. "The fact that my weight isn't such a focus in our marriage anymore—because I made it bigger than it had to be—gives us an opportunity to change the discussion, instead of an endless loop of 'I am fat.' 'No, you aren't,' " Ms. Schow says. "As I started to fix myself, I stopped fighting myself, so I stopped fighting him, too." —Email Elizabeth Bernstein at Bonds@wsj.com or follow her column at www.Facebook.com/EBernsteinWSJ.
