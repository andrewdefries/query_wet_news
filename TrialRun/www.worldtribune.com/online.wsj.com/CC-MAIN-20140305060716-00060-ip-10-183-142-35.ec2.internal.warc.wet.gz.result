French outdoor advertising company JCDecaux SA (DEC.FR) Thursday said it expects like-for-like sales to decline slightly in the first quarter as European markets weakened further in January and February after posting a drop in full-year net profit. MAIN FACTS: - Net profit for the year fell to EUR162.8 million from EUR212.6 million, hit by a EUR44.6 million impairment charge - Total revenue rose 6.5% to EUR2.62 billion, up 1.5% on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, disposals and foreign exchange movements. - Operating profit rose 3.5% to EUR602.2 million in 2012 from EUR582.1 million in 2011, giving the group a margin of 23%, a 60 basis points drop from the previous year due to tough conditions in Europe. - JCDecaux will recommend to pay a dividend of EUR0.44 a share for 2012 at the group's next general meeting. -Write to Ruth Bender at ruth.bender@dowjones.com Order free Annual Report for JCDecaux SA

Por DAVID WESSEL
Después de adquirir la aseguradora de salud U.S. Healthcare Inc. en 1996, Aetna Inc. temió que el cierre de varias oficinas provocara la pérdida de valiosos recursos humanos. Para evitarlo, dejó que algunos empleados trabajaran desde sus hogares. Diez años después, sin embargo, apenas 9% del personal del gigante estadounidense de seguros laboraba a tiempo completo desde sus domicilios.A mediados de la década pasada, la empresa empezó a considerar el trabajo desde casa como algo más que un favor para los empleados. "Hubo un momento en que nos dimos cuenta de que había una oportunidad para reducir costos, sobre todo en el área de bienes raíces", señala Elease Wright, subdirectora senior de recursos humanos y que trabaja en la sede central de Aetna, en el estado de Connecticut. Hoy en día, 47% de los 35.000 empleados de la aseguradora trabaja desde casa. No se trata de revisar el correo electrónico después de la cena o no ir a la oficina los viernes, sino de trabajar todos los días, sin un escritorio, cubículo ni computadora en otro lugar. Dan DeLucia, vicepresidente del área de Aetna que negocia acuerdos con médicos y hospitales, ha trabajado desde su hogar en Nueva York durante nueve años. "Al principio tenía mis dudas", confiesa. "Me preocupaba cómo iba a desempeñarme a distancia. No había mensajería instantánea ni capacidades de video con las velocidades actuales", señala. "Muy pronto me di cuenta de que hablaba más y me comunicaba más… que cuando conversaba cara a cara en la oficina", añadió DeLucia, recordando la época en que intercambiaba e-mails con compañeros que se sentaban a dos cubículos de distancia. Muchas empresas estadounidenses promueven el trabajo a distancia. Cerca de 20% de los empleados de Cigna Corp., otra compañía de seguros, trabaja desde su domicilio. Alrededor de 9,4 millones de estadounidenses, 6,6% de la fuerza laboral, trabajó exclusivamente desde casa como su empleo principal en 2010, según una encuesta de la Oficina del Censo sobre Ingresos y Participación en Programas, un alza frente al 4,8% de 1997. No obstante, ninguna empresa ha ido tan lejos en este sentido como Aetna. Su campaña para trasladar a sus empleados desde las oficinas a sus casas refleja el esfuerzo de las grandes compañías estadounidenses del sector de servicios para reducir costos, así como el efecto que las comunicaciones baratas, confiables y rápidas, particularmente Internet, tienen sobre la economía.

Jesse Neider para The Wall Street Journal
Susan O'Donnell para Aetna trabaja desde casa.
La oportunidad de trabajar desde casa es más frecuente en puestos que dependen de una computadora, un teléfono y una conexión a Internet. Los empleados de Aetna deben tener un espacio silencioso, lejos de los ladridos de los perros y los llantos de los niños. La compañía paga por muebles de oficina, en caso de ser necesarios, como un gabinete con llave para guardar archivos y una trituradora de papeles, además de una computadora, servicio de teléfono e Internet. "Convertí uno de los dormitorios en una oficina con un calefactor, para no tener que encender la calefacción en el resto de la casa", relata Susan O'Donnell, una enfermera que vive en Northfield, Connecticut. Pasó de trabajar en un hospital a convertirse en gestora de casos de Aetna hace 12 años, algo que hace desde su hogar desde hace siete años. Valora la flexibilidad, haber terminado con un trayecto hasta la oficina que a veces resultaba frustrante y el tiempo que pasa con su familia.La empresa, por su parte, ahorra dinero. Aetna estima que los costos de bienes raíces y aspectos relacionados son entre 15% y 25% más bajos que si los empleados trabajaron desde sus oficinas, lo que representa un ahorro anual cercano a los US$80 millones. Trabajar desde el hogar redujo el espacio de oficinas total de Aetna en 250.000 metros cuadrados, estima la empresa. Algunas divisiones exigen que los empleados trabajen un año en la oficina antes de hacerlo desde sus casas. Otras establecen como requisito tener una productividad mayor al promedio.
Aetna también realiza esfuerzos deliberados por lograr que los empleados remotos participen en las conferencias telefónicas. Algunas unidades programan reuniones en persona para que los trabajadores se vean las caras. Los supervisores, igualmente, ofrecen consejos para que los empleados en sus casas sepan distinguir entre el trabajo y el resto de sus actividades cotidianas. Pero hay un problema: los empleados remotos tienden a pesar más y Aetna ofrece programas en línea para mantenerlos en forma.

Should voters have to show identification?
Before last year, just two states, Georgia and Indiana, had voter-ID laws. Since Republicans took control of many state governments in 2010, 10 states have adopted such laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, an advocacy and public-interest law firm that tends to side with liberals on voting issues.

We now know that voting fraud happened in Philly, Ohio, Fla., and yet the MSM keeps lying about this. So it is only common sense that says, have an ID. But, liberal Dems have no common sense and yes, they are not patriotic since they want power above our Const., free enterprise, clean elections, and honest domestic and foreign policies. Better to have a Black Icon , incompetent and radical than say a really patriotic black like Alan West win.

Kenneth Koons said ; "We now know that voting fraud happened....... " We all know voter fraud can happen, this is well documented. The "Urban Myth" it could elect an illegal President in the modern era is unproven. No data so far has come from a credible source. As all the information so far on voter fraud is from conservative 'think tanks', filtered through their agencies and given the usual political spin. But we would welcome a credible source of information. Can you post some links?

Les Lovett said ; "Check these out Kenny, you grinning fool." Your message to Kenneth Koons, is a little over the top : | I don't think it helps 'mocking' by posting a list of conservative lobbyist propaganda url and reference to the resulting media spin helps the debate. But understand your indignation at his naivety and your use of sarcasm on this issue. It is frustrating seeing weighted 'Team' bias clouding thinking of anyone.Always enjoy your perspective here, keep the comments coming : )

What possible (good) argument could there be against it? Heck, we have to show ID to buy a $25 purchase, why not to provide evidence we are American citizens?I suspect the one and only reason for opposition is, Democrats who want illegal aliens to vote, because they'll be more likely to vote Democrat.

Don Hansen said "I suspect the one and only reason for opposition is, Democrats who want illegal aliens to vote" Given a great deal of conservative voters employ illegal aliens cheaply to make profit, just how many are prepared to step up and back new "ID" schemes will be interesting? If your premise is true, it will also be interesting to see what the Republican dominated House of Representatives proposes, the time for them to act on "centralized ID" is now. Maybe they will again wait until the last year of current Government and just try the state ID strategy again.However the strategy might again just motivate more people to get voter "ID" and bother to exercise their right to vote, leaving their 'life condition' victim mindset behind. The voter demographics are more advanced than ever, as this economist article outlines - http://goo.gl/qSQtw

"Given a great deal of conservative voters employ illegal aliens cheaply to make profit, just how many are prepared to step up and back new 'ID' schemes will be interesting?"Don't know why you ended that sentence with a question mark (you aren't sure if it will be interesting?) but anyway...Exactly how many conservative employers hire illegal aliens? You seem to think you know. I'd be curious to know how such statistics would even be possible to attain.And actually, reason argues against your theory. Which party is more likely to be lenient on illegal immigration? Democrats. So, why would an employer who depends on illegal aliens for his profits, vote for leaders who were more likely to cut off their cheap labor supply?Furthermore, although *small* business owners are more likely to be politically conservative, there are plenty of liberal business owners too. And they're just as likely to hire illegals, I'll contend, if not more so, given their more lenient view towards illegal immigration. Think liberal business owners are less focused on making money? Think liberal business owners are less likely to do unethical things to boost profits? If so, then think again. I've seen plenty of it in real life, from both sides.And finally, even if your premise were true, such Republican voters would represent a minuscule portion of the electorate. Ergo, insignificant to elections. So, this line of yours is (yet another) fantasy the liberal-left has invented -- something they have to do a lot of, because reality rarely works as they wish.Sigh. Anyway, the goal is to only allow American citizens to vote. That shouldn't have any opposition. And yet, whenever it comes up, it's Democrats opposing it, not Republicans. Explain that.

Don Hansen said " Which party is more likely to be lenient on illegal immigration? Democrats. So, why would an employer who depends on illegal aliens for his profits, vote for leaders who were more likely to cut off their cheap labor supply?" Precisely, and you have made the 'assumption' I am a 'team' player. In voting terms I would be known as a swing voter. Thank you for pointing out the flaw in your suspicion.Don Hansen said " .... suspect the one and 'only' reason" Only, being the keyword. I find it humorous that each side [Liberal v Conservative] call each other out and just about any justification for values can apply to both. Either side unable to walk in the others shoes without utter bias.

1. "Precisely." No, the point is that such business owners would not be Republican in the first place. Which counters your theory (which mimics liberal-left story lines, regardless if you're a "swing voter" and not a "team player") that Republican businessmen employ illegal aliens (disproportionately, relative to liberal businessmen).2. "Thank you for pointing out the flaw in your suspicion." No. As I also wrote, illegal-alien-hiring businessmen are an insignificant voting bloc, Republican or Democrat. And so, it's not enough to drive public passions, rhetoric, talking points, etc. That's the question on the table here: why there is any substantial, public, politically-motivated opposition to voter ID. Big-name Democratic politicians oppose it, and it's not to win votes from illegal alien hiring employers."I find it humorous that each side [Liberal v Conservative] call each other out and just about any justification for values that can apply to both. Both sides unable to walk in the others shoes without utter bias"Paul, I presented a rational argument: why is there *any* opposition? I then provided my best guess as to the motivation behind the opposition. It is based on decades of learning about politics. If you or anyone else can provide a rational argument suggesting a different reason for the opposition, then I'd like to hear it. The Democratic-supplied argument of worries about "disenfranchising" American citizens who don't drive (and therefore don't have a driver's license) and find it too difficult to get a free ID card from a government agency, makes no sense. And we all know that Democrats love to play the race card, especially with Hispanics, to win votes. And Hispanics are sensitive to illegal immigration, especially with Democrats playing the race card there, telling them it's racist to want to close the border to illegal immigration. Hispanics voted Democrat by a large margin. So, it all fits, with a political game plan to present themselves as the party that cares about Hispanics. Never mind if it makes any sense for America, to allow illegal aliens to vote. It scores points with Hispanics, so, they do it. That is my theory on the motivation behind it, rationally deduced, without bias.Again, if you have a different theory, then present it. What you've presented so far, has not suggested a thoughtful analysis of the situation, but rather just reciting Democratic talking points.

Don Hansen said " I then provided my best guess as to the motivation behind the opposition." Yes agreed, and all appropriate from your perspective. All good lines of argument, from your 'stage of development.' Considering my position that both sides are full of neoliberal thinkers, and my views align with alter-globalization. From my perspective, neither conservatives or liberals have healthy leadership needed to help the majority of Americans. Since R W Reagan with 'Reaganomics' started openly cherry picking Milton Friedman's economic ideas, many conservatives have been enamoured with the neoliberal concepts. In President Obama's first speech he has proposed another cherry picked idea of a Freidman's of a wealth tax. Both parties use Freidman's ideas, keeping corporations at the apex of the economic pyramid. Corporations who can live forever, have no value system and prime directive is profit. neoliberal - http://goo.gl/ZntmN alter-globalization - http://goo.gl/P81qY stage of development - http://goo.gl/CLRMc

"Yes agreed, and all appropriate from your perspective. All good lines of argument, from your 'stage of development.' "Bologna. Your fallacy is thinking that "if Side X finds fault with Side Y, then it's inherently biased." It's not inherently biased.Paul, you may *want* me to be a small-minded partisan, but I'm not. I'd like nothing better than for liberals to have a unique, coherent, viewpoint, to present it to the public, and then for competing ideas about how best to lead America to be hashed out in the public square.As for your contentions about both sides being out of wack, all I can say is, deal with it. In America, our political system only has room for two parties, because a third party cannot win. And those two parties will be conservative or liberal, relatively speaking, with one wanting to move us more in the conservative direction, and other wanting to move in a liberal direction. Those are your only two choices in American politics, due to the nature of our form of government. If you vote for a third party, then it's solely for self-gratification, not improving America.

Don Hansen said " ...our political system only has room for two parties, because a third party cannot win. And those two parties will be conservative or liberal, " Why, it is the peoples government? Sounds like you have thrown the towel in. Demand change. If the apex of the economic pyramid is wrong, it follows the government will soon morph into a corporation, bringing America full circle politically. As this is how the 'corporation' started, it was a tool to protect dying feudal monarchies wealth. Do your research, do not take my opinion.For example today the two central banks are private corporations, they already control the money, QE controls land value, salary or wage. It was the European Renaissance development of the 'corporation' to protect 'wealth' of the few that drove the Protestant settlers out of Europe and to America. What possibility is there of an advanced culture like the US regressing to that state of affairs? None, so change is needed. Are Americans going to be run by a corporation or corporations or by the voters? Will a centralized ID card become an employee number? Is the 'timing' of a centralized ID critical to its introduction, like state based ID was at the last election? [These questions are rhetorical]

"Why, it is the peoples government?"No, it's the nature of government, in a winner-takes-all form of governing such as ours. In a parliamentary system, there can be representatives from a plethora of political parties. But in ours, only one can win. And so, the decision, in its simplest form, is "more liberal or more conservative?" It's reduced to that, because that's the only way to win 51% of the votes.

Right on. No one has mentioned that. Suppose you belonged to Acorn and someone told you that you could only vote once? You have to take a balanced view.

If showing an ID to vote is racist and evil, so is Obamacare because you can't get care at a Hospital without showing ID, giving ss# & date of birth. Just change the title to "Voter and Medical" ID.

I don't comment often, but thought this was timely. I live in a state that requires voter id - I have no problems with it for this reason: when I entered the voting location, I knew NO ONE that was there waiting to help the voters. My ID makes me comfortable in doing something with people I don't know. Same reason when I shop in a grocery, pharmacy or department store, my id makes me comfortable with strangers. There is a flip side to that question: the people waiting on me don't know me, so they are comfortable in assisting me since I am providing an id. THAT IS WHAT MAKES the process work! Comfort level is secure.

Every voting-person SHOULD be required to "PROVE WHO HE OR SHE REALLY IS"!!!I.D is required for ALMOST any financial transaction!!!Right now you can go to ANY polling-place and look at the name and address of a registered voter in front of the poll-worker on his "voter-sheets" and say you're "whomever" and sign that name and "VIOLA!!!" you can vote!!! How wrong is that? HMMMM???Let's get real!It happens more than other think because it's so easy to DO WITHOUT AN I.D! I MIGHT ADD WHEN I'D VOTED I handed the "Poll-worker" my DMV license because I wanted to to make a point and she said "Sir! That is NOT REQUIRED!!!Talking about the potential for "voting abuse"!!!

A democracy has a deep obligation to let its citizens vote.If ID is necessary, the state should be sure it is easy and essentially free to get. Otherwise, you generate the equivalent of a poll tax, which has a long history of intending to suppress votes.This is NOT complicated.

Mr. French,I cannot imagine being able to function in THIS country without an ID; can you? Consider all the areas in life where having/presenting an ID is required: banking, traveling (flying), purchasing things with a credit card or check; cashing government checks; carrying a license is REQUIRED if you drive, buying alcoholic beverages or tobacco; enrolling in school; enrolling your children in school, etc.It's preposterous to suggest that requiring someone in this country to have an ID to vote would be the equivalent of a poll tax. The only people this would disenfranchise are either ILLEGAL aliens or those who intend to vote more than once. It's virtually impossible in this country to go about your daily life WITHOUT an ID. Think about it!

Community organizers in areas where few can read English have been delivering 100% votes for their candidate ever since 1947 when I took my first course in poly sci. So it is nothing new, it is how urban areas vote. The important question is, are we going to get real in voting rights? Voters should have to show voter ID in every national election and that should be federal law. Moreover, I'd go one step farther and pay VISA to verify they'd only voted once. If VISA got to keep the fines for those who'd broken the law they'd probably do it free or for a percentage of the fines.

Senators Tom Coburn, Richard Burr and Saxby Chambliss leave the dinner.
Getty Images President Barack Obama
stepped up his wooing of rank-and-file Republican lawmakers Wednesday, hosting a dozen senators at a dinner at a Washington restaurant and setting a visit to the Capitol in hopes of reigniting talks on a broad budget deal. The efforts mark his most aggressive outreach to lawmakers in years and show Mr. Obama
is trying to build his own coalition in Congress at a time when his past negotiating partners in the GOP leadership are under renewed pressure to accommodate the party's conservative base. Mr. Obama phoned a number of senators not in leadership positions over the weekend to gauge support for what has come to be known as a grand bargain on deficit reduction and other fiscal issues. One hurdle: Sharply different views on taxes. Mr. Obama has insisted that tax increases be part of any deal to rein in deficits, while many Republicans are open to tax increases only as part of a revenue-neutral broad reform of the tax code, in which tax rates would be reduced. "The heart of the discussion tonight was, 'How do we get there? How do we get people to come together and really effect the reforms?' " said Sen. John Hoeven
(R., N.D.), one of the dinner attendees. Mr. Hoeven said he saw the opportunity to reach a grand-bargain-style deal as the House and Senate work on their budgets for the next fiscal year and lawmakers face a May deadline for raising the federal borrowing limit. There is "a recognition we really need to do this in the next four- to five-month window. The key is to stay in this intense dialogue," Mr. Hoeven said. The dinner topics included the mandatory spending cuts known as the sequester, the continuing budget resolution passed Wednesday by the House to extend the government's funding past March 27, energy and an overhaul of the immigration system, Mr. Hoeven said. "The real focus was the debt and the deficit and how we come up with the kind of bipartisan reforms, tax reform and entitlement reform, that preserves and protects Social Security and Medicare, but that also enables us to deal with the debt and the deficit on a long-term basis," Mr. Hoeven added. Sen. Lindsey Graham
(R., S.C.), speaking before he attended the event, said that the president asked him to organize the dinner at the Jefferson Hotel and that he believed Mr. Obama was looking to start a substantive discussion. More House Approves Stopgap Budget Deal Forced Cuts Affecting Lawmakers' Offices, Too Live: Budget Battle Stream The White House is actively courting Mr. Graham because he has said he would be open to raising tax revenue as part of a larger deal that also would retool entitlement programs. A senior administration official said that "the president greatly enjoyed the dinner and had a good exchange of ideas with the senators." The White House said Mr. Obama paid for the meal from his own pocket, a move that, along with the neutral venue, seemed designed to show the president was reaching out. Some Republicans remained doubtful that Mr. Obama can strike a deal that would shore up Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs, reduce deficits and potentially overhaul the tax code. Some went so far as to dismiss the dinner as political theater. In addition to the dinner, the president has asked to address Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate next week. And in recent weeks he has stepped up contacts with business leaders, who could be important allies in maintaining momentum in the budget talks, should they begin in earnest. The overtures mark a departure for a president who has been criticized for shunning lawmakers, choosing instead to socialize and play golf with a small circle of friends and aides. One of the dinner invitees, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), said in an interview beforehand that Mr. Obama showed little appetite for direct talks with lawmakers in his first term, but that his stance had shifted lately. "Whether that translates into action, I'm not sure," he said. "I want to work with the guy." One barrier is the high level of mutual distrust. Rare is the day in Washington when the two parties aren't blaming one another for gridlock. Related Video
On the day President Obama invited a group of Republican Senators to a private dinner, Sen. John McCain tells WSJ's Jerry Seib that such overtures are being "well received" and are a sign that the president "now is interested in outreach and dialogue."
Wednesday brought fresh examples: The Democratic National Committee launched a website blaming Republicans for what it said were hardships imposed by the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester, while House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) chided the administration for canceling tours of the White House due to the sequester cuts. Some Republicans who weren't invited questioned Mr. Obama's sincerity. "Call me cynical, but it just feels like, well, the media criticizes him, his approval ratings drop and suddenly he wants to talk," said Rep. Patrick Tiberi
(R., Ohio). Sen. John Thune
(R., S.D.), the Senate's No. 3 leader, wasn't invited to the dinner, but was more welcoming. "This seems to be a more general outreach than just trying to pick off a couple of Republican senators," he said. "So, hopefully, this will be more meaningful." Enlarge Image
The president, shown Tuesday, will meet with Congress on budget issues.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Even some Democrats are doubtful that Mr. Obama's latest efforts will bear fruit. Senate Democrats believe the White House had far more leverage at the end of 2012, when Republicans were eager to avoid across-the-board tax increases under what was called the fiscal cliff. Mr. Obama hosted several gatherings with chief executives to seek input as he tried to reach a budget deal at the end of the year. After he gave a speech last week to CEOs at a Washington hotel, he lingered for nearly an hour for private discussions with the corporate leaders, moving table to table, said someone who was at the gathering. Senior Obama aides also have held conference calls with the chiefs of several dozen top companies, including Xerox Corp.

, according to participants on the calls. "The president and his aides realize they need as many allies as they can get for the four years ahead," said one executive who has been in the thick of the recent White House outreach campaign. Recent calls hosted by Obama advisers Valerie Jarrett
and Gene Sperling
have focused on concerns about the sequester and perceived sticking points in moving forward on an immigration overhaul, according to call participants.The most recent call was on Friday, the day the automatic budget cuts began. Several people who have been on the calls say the White House hasn't pushed business leaders to lobby Congress on the White House's behalf.An important question is whether the two sides can reach an understanding on how to use the revenue that a tax-code rewrite could generate. Generally, Republicans want to use it to lower tax rates while Democrats want to use it to forestall further spending cuts. The White House also plans to send first lady Michelle Obama and an array of top White House aides to talk next week to a Business Roundtable gathering of about 60 CEOs. Tax reform is a top priority for many Republicans, making it a potential bargaining chip as Mr. Obama and lawmakers decide whether they can sweep several budget questions into one set of talks. Those negotiations would include discretionary spending restraints, long-term entitlement reforms and "a process to get to pro-growth tax reform," said Sen. Rob Portman
(R., Ohio). Rep. Chris Van Hollen
(D., Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said recently some tax breaks could be eliminated as part of a deal to soften the effects of the sequester, which Democrats want, without undermining the longer-term goal of a tax-code overhaul. The GOP goal of lowering rates could become "part of the negotiation" over a tax rewrite, he added. —Neil King and John McKinnon contributed to this article.
