The Bite of Redistricting Shrinks Ranks of Blue Dogs
By
Naftali Bendavid
Updated April 26, 2012 9:40 a.m. ET
The centrist Democrats known as "Blue Dogs" sometimes say they've been "choked blue" by the liberals who dominate their party. But now it is Republicans and redistricting that are threatening to cripple this once-influential group of House members. The ranks of the Blue Dogs—known for their fiscal conservatism and the central role they played in the 2010 debate over health care—have already fallen from 54 members before the last election to 25 today. With the defeat of two leading members in Tuesday's...

Alex Barnett
spent 14 years as an attorney handling several high-profile class-action lawsuits involving consumer fraud and product defects. But after getting laid off by two firms in the spring of 2008, he began prepping for a different kind of spotlight: He launched a career in stand-up comedy. Facing a tough job market, many lawyers struggling to find work like Mr. Barnett are re-examining their roles and testing the waters in other fields. Some are attempting to stay in the industry by taking temporary work as contract lawyers—low-profile, lower-paying positions that often involve more routine work, according to consultants and industry experts. Others are becoming accountants, consultants or teachers. "Quite frankly a significant number of lawyers are simply moving out of the profession, just looking to do completely different things," says Jerry Kowalski,
a law-firm consultant based in New York and Washington, D.C. "The overall picture is the huge oversupply of lawyers." Enlarge Image
Alex Barnett, who works as a contract lawyer by day, is also a stand-up comedian. He organized an open-mic night at Cafe Addis in New York.
Alfred Giancarli for The Wall Street Journal The portion of law-school graduates who held jobs that required a law degree and passing the bar exam shrunk to 71% for the class of 2009, from 75% for the class of 2008, according to a survey by the National Association for Law Placement. The survey also found that nearly 25% of employed graduates said their work was temporary. And almost 22% said they were still looking for work even though they were employed, up from 16% in 2008. Many large law firms let go of lawyers in the recession and adjusted to working with slimmer staffs, says Deborah Epstein Henry,
founder of Flex-Time Lawyers LLC, a consulting firm based in Philadelphia that advises law firms, corporations and law students on work-life balance and new models for legal practice. At the same time, more corporations learned to rely more on their internal lawyers and cut back on hiring external counsel, she says. And some firms are now outsourcing the work they used to give to junior associates, meaning newer lawyers are seeing fewer positions where they would traditionally receive training and launch their careers, she says. "The law firm model is really changing," she says, adding that many lawyers are changing their specialties or pursuing nonlegal jobs in legal venues, such as professional development roles at law firms or jobs with career services at law schools, while they wait out the job market. Bar associations say more lawyers are asking for tips on ways to apply their skills in other fields. When the New York State Bar Association originally created the Committee on Lawyers in Transition, it was meant to help attorneys re-join the profession after an absence. But when the economy declined in 2008, the committee changed its focus to help attorneys who were laid off and exploring other industries. "All of a sudden people weren't coming into the profession all gung ho, people were being laid off and fired," says Lauren Wachtler,
chairwoman of the committee. The group began holding seminars in person and online to address issues faced by attorneys looking for creative approaches to finding work, offering tips for starting their own practice, addressing a layoff during a job search, speaking to headhunters and beefing up resumes. In September 2009, the association launched a pro bono clerkship program for lawyers who wanted to stay productive while they looked for jobs. Several participants said the clerkship led to full-time work, says Ms. Wachtler. "If people are laid off it gives them an opportunity to reassess where they are or where they're going," she says. Last summer, Mr. Barnett was one of several attorneys who spoke at a panel organized by the New York State Bar Association for lawyers seeking advice on ways to apply their skills in other industries. Mr. Barnett hasn't exited law completely. He has a day job as a contract lawyer for the city of New York, a behind-the-scenes job that often involves reviewing documents and preparing deposition outlines. After clocking out of the office, he spends most of his evenings writing jokes and performing them wherever he can—at comedy clubs, open-mike nights, fundraising dinners or church events. Not all of his comedy gigs are paid, but he says the paid opportunities are growing. Mr. Barnett makes about half of his previous salary as a plaintiffs' lawyer between his comedian work and his day job. He declines to specify what he previously earned as a lawyer. Mr. Barnett says he tries to be on stage about six nights a week, where he cracks jokes about his personal life—the transition of moving in with his girlfriend, the gentrification he sees in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He rarely talks about being a lawyer. Write to Jonnelle Marte at jonnelle.marte@wsj.com Email

Gabriele Steinhauser and Tom Fairless in Brussels and Neil MacLucas in Zurich Updated Feb. 28, 2013 6:58 a.m. ET
The European Union has moved to slap a strict limit on the bonuses of bank executives, a move likely to be replicated elsewhere as politicians move to rein in pay and cut down on risk-taking in banks. WSJ's David Enrich reports. Photo: Reuters
The European Union moved to slap a strict limit on bank executives' bonuses in the latest effort to curb what is seen by many as corporate and banking excess. Negotiators for the European Parliament and EU states said they reached a preliminary deal on a measure that would forbid bonuses that exceed a bankers' fixed salary. Flexible pay could increase to twice fixed salary, but only with explicit shareholder approval. The initiative, part of a broader law that forces lenders to build up more-robust financial cushions, is designed to reduce incentives for the type of risky behavior widely blamed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis. The EU push comes as Swiss voters will indicate on Sunday just how deep their resentment of big executive paychecks runs when they vote on a controversial plan that would give shareholders sweeping authority over executive compensation. The 24 items contained in the Swiss referendum, dubbed the "rip-off" initiative, would allow shareholders to block salaries, ban so-called golden handshakes and parachutes—forms of guaranteed parting packages—and require greater transparency on loans and pensions to executives and directors. The measure includes fines and prison sentences for violations. The moves in Brussels and in Switzerland, if successful, would represent the most intrusive intervention yet into how banks and corporations compensate employees and executives—an issue that was for years considered an internal corporate matter. The EU pay limits would apply to all European banks, including their operations abroad, as well as U.S. and other foreign banks' subsidiaries in the EU, officials representing both member states and the Parliament said. That provision may be reviewed in a few years' time, they added. Members of Parliament, which first introduced the bonus caps and fought hard against efforts to water them down, hailed the preliminary accord. "If I have to judge from the reaction of the [banking] industry, this will impact them. And this will also impact the overall amount of remuneration," said Philippe Lamberts,
a Belgian lawmaker for the Green Party who was one of the leading negotiators for Parliament. "I think it will really hit them." Related CEO Prods Swiss to Curb Excessive Pay Novartis Pay Plan Galvanizes Swiss Voters Bankers have lobbied strongly against the European bonus caps, claiming they will hamper their ability to hire talented staff and put them at a competitive disadvantage to their counterparts in the U.S. and elsewhere. Negotiators said that some longer-term bonuses that don't lead to actual payouts for at least five years may be discounted when the caps are calculated. But that provision, along with several other elements of the deal, will have to be nailed down in another round of talks and could still be rejected by member states, they stressed. The negotiators said the new bank rules should come into force on Jan. 1, 2014, provided they get formal sign-off from both the full European Parliament and EU finance ministers and can be written into national law in all 27 member states in time. Efforts to curb pay have backfired before. A 1993 U.S. tax law that said companies couldn't deduct senior executive pay over $1 million from their taxable income ended up establishing that level as a minimum for CEO pay and encouraged the spread of less-transparent forms of pay, such as pensions and deferred compensation. Big London-based investment banks already are looking at ways to lessen the impact of the potential new rules, such as sharply boosting base salaries, industry officials said. That could make it harder for banks to claw back pay if a bank runs into trouble. The bonus caps are being introduced as part of EU legislation to ensure banks carry adequate capital cushions in line with the so-called Basel accords agreed in the Swiss city by international banking supervisors. Bankers' pay wasn't part of the Basel agreements, but lawmakers in the European Parliament insisted on limiting payouts linked to short-term profits because they were seen as driving bankers to take excessive risks in the lead-up to the crisis. Between 2008 and 2009, EU countries pumped €2 trillion ($2.63 trillion) into their lenders, and bank failures have also been at the root of broader government-debt crises that followed. The referendum in Switzerland caps an emotional four-year effort by Thomas Minder,
a businessman turned politician who has campaigned against excessive executive compensation. The initiative's chances of success were boosted earlier this month when Novartis AG

scrapped a proposed exit package of 72 million Swiss francs ($66.9 million) for outgoing Chairman Daniel Vasella
after it stirred controversy across the country. The Minder initiative would give shareholders wide power in shaping how Swiss companies pay executives and board members. Under its rules, shareholders are required to approve or reject executive pay packages every year. It would ban golden handshakes and golden parachutes and would require greater transparency on loans and pensions for executive board members. Under the proposal, breaches would be penalized with fines of up to six times annual salary or imprisonment for up to three years. Mr. Minder's ideas have resonated with his countrymen amid growing resentment of executive pay since the government's 2008 bailout of UBS AG

, received a 13-million-franc signing bonus when he joined the engineering and power company in 2008, while UBS's German Chairman Axel Weber
got five million francs when he joined the bank this year. By comparison, the average Swiss worker earned 69,400 francs in 2010, according to the Federal Statistics Office. "If my initiative is approved, there will be a revolution in corporate annual general meetings," Mr. Minder said in an interview. "They will become properly democratic procedures." The debate on big paychecks began to widen beyond a narrow group of shareholder activists following a rash of corporate accounting scandals more than a decade ago at companies such as WorldCom and Enron; it took on new momentum after the 2008 financial crash. This week's developments in Europe take the debate a big step forward by giving corporate outsiders more direct say on pay levels, rather than just react to them. In 2011, the EU already required banks to defer large parts of bonus payouts three to five years into the future. More broadly, investors in the U.K. began casting advisory, or nonbinding, votes on corporate pay in 2003. Pay for U.K. executives continued to rise, but some activists believe the shareholder votes curbed excesses. Other European countries, notably the Netherlands, adopted stricter regulations. Investors in Dutch companies have had a binding vote since 2004 on material changes to executive pay policies. Though the debate on executive pay is less charged in the U.S., attitudes shifted during the financial crisis after some Wall Street executives walked away with multimillion-dollar packages before their companies failed or needed government support. Starting in 2011, the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law gave shareholders at all but the smallest U.S. companies a nonbinding say-on-pay vote. Some companies where investors defeated or narrowly approved their pay practices reacted by tightening ties between pay and corporate performance. —David Enrich in London, John Revill in Zurich and Joann S.

FBI Seeks Three Men Over Attack in Benghazi

Updated May 1, 2013 6:23 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking three men in Libya in connection with its investigation into the attack on the U.S. posts in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. The FBI on Wednesday released grainy photographs of three men at the scene of the attacks but whose identities are unknown, the first public evidence to emerge from the probe in seven months.

President Barack Obama speaking in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate on Wednesday.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images BERLIN—Standing before a towering emblem of the Cold War, President Barack Obama
called for steep reductions in nuclear weapons through negotiations with the Russians, as a step toward what he conceded was the "distant" goal of eliminating global arsenals. "We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not safe," Mr. Obama said Wednesday in an address in front of the Brandenburg Gate in his first visit to the German capital as president. "I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures." In a wide-ranging foreign-policy speech in Berlin, President Obama called for negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the two nations' Cold War military posture and reducing the arsenal of nuclear arms by up to one-third. Watch highlights here.
His public invitation—which included his assessment that the U.S. can cut the number of deployed nuclear weapons by one-third without compromising American security—received a cool reception from Moscow. Mr. Obama's speech came five years after he visited Berlin and drew a crowd of 200,000 people who wanted a glimpse of the rising young candidate, and 50 years after former President John F. Kennedy showed solidarity with residents of the divided city, declaring "Ich bin ein Berliner." He sought to link his moral and policy agenda to that of the 35th president. Reciting a less-known phrase from Kennedy's speech in Berlin that day, Mr. Obama said he, too, wants to achieve "peace with justice"—by doing away with nuclear arms, ensuring women have the same opportunities as men and reversing the effects of climate change. He pledged, without offering details, to take new measures to protect the environment. "Peace with justice means refusing to condemn our children to a harsher, less hospitable planet," he said. "The effort to slow climate change requires bold action. … Our dangerous carbon emissions have come down. But we know we have to do more. And we will do more." Enlarge Image
It remains unclear how a move to reduce nuclear arms could affect U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in Europe, particularly those delivered by aircraft. Mr. Obama raised his planned initiative in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week at a summit meeting in Northern Ireland, said Yuri Ushakov,
the Kremlin's top foreign-policy official. Mr. Putin, speaking to arms industry officials in St. Petersburg at about the same time Mr. Obama spoke in Berlin, didn't directly mention Mr. Obama's initiative. But he warned that Russia needs to preserve its deterrent and strategic stability in the face of threats from U.S. missile-defense plans as well as from increasingly powerful nonnuclear weapons that he said "are approaching the level of strategic nuclear arms in their strike capability." Nuclear weapons play a larger role in Russia's defense posture than they do for the U.S., according to analysts and diplomats, because of the Kremlin's dramatically smaller conventional forces. That has rendered Russia much more skeptical about further cuts, according to analysts. "The Obama initiative is a continuation of the consistent U.S. course toward drawing Russia into the process of further and quite dramatic nuclear disarmament, which for our country is of course absolutely unacceptable," the official RIA-Novosti news agency quotedIgor Korotchenko, a member of a Defense Ministry advisory panel, as saying. Moscow also believes that talks on any further cuts in strategic-nuclear forces should include all major nuclear powers, Mr. Ushakov said, according to official Russian news agencies, in an apparent reference to China's growing arsenal. "Today the situation is far from what it was in the 1960s and 1970s, when only the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had talks on reducing nuclear arsenals," Mr. Ushakov said, saying the parties needed to "enlarge the circle of participants." Mr. Obama, in his speech, raised the importance of containing the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea and pledged to secure U.S. ratification of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. He appealed to all nations to begin talks to establish a treaty that ends the production of fissile materials used to make nuclear weapons. "These are steps we can take to create a world of peace with justice," he said. View Slideshow
U.S. President Barack Obama waves next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel before they deliver speeches in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Wednesday.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images More Berliners Turn Out Again for Obama, but Less Enthusiastically Summit's Syria Stance Averts Fissure Takeaways: Obama at the Brandenburg Gate Mr. Obama ran into a rare logistical hurdle in the course of the address—his teleprompter broke down, a White House official said, forcing him to look down at the pages of text in front of him. One of the biggest bursts of applause during the speech came when Mr. Obama again pledged to close Guantanamo. Earlier in the day, at a news conference, a German reporter asked Mr. Obama about the prison, saying that "there were a number of hopes in the world that were in a way shattered" because of his record. The president acknowledged that closing Guantanamo hasn't been as easy as he had hoped. Citing congressional resistance, he said: "One of the things you discover as a politician is that people don't always do exactly what you want. It's shocking. And then you have to keep on working at it." Mr. Obama also said the U.S. wasn't preparing to go to war in Syria and welcomed support from world leaders this week to pursue a political transition in the country and end the civil war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. The White House said last week that it would provide arms to moderate camps of Syrian rebels. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama said reports that Washington was laying the groundwork for a military intervention to oust Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad
were "a little overcranked" and emphasized that the U.S. is determined to find a political solution to the civil war in Syria. He stressed that a peaceful solution could come only with a new government. Washington Wire Transcript of Obama's Speech in Berlin Full Speech

Mr. Obama arrived in Berlin on Tuesday night from Northern Ireland, where he had attended a meeting of the Group of Eight large industrialized nations. He spoke privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday morning. Later, at a joint news conference, Ms. Merkel said the two had discussed recent disclosures that U.S. intelligence agencies are examining Internet and phone records. German officials have voiced qualms about such intrusions on privacy. For her part, Ms. Merkel didn't seem entirely reassured by the president's explanations. "People have concerns, precisely concerns that there may be some kind of blanket, across-the-board gathering of information," she said, speaking through a translator. "We talked about this. The questions that we have not yet perhaps satisfactorily addressed we will address later on." About 4,500 people then turned out later at a sunny, 90 degree afternoon to hear Mr. Obama. At a dinner hosted by Ms. Merkel, the president made reference to the heat and cited a newspaper report that 1,000 people had fainted during the Kennedy speech, many because of their emotional response to the U.S. president's words. "We did not have 1,000 people faint today," Mr. Obama said. "The few who did, did so because of the weather and not because of my speech." —Marcus Walker and Gregory L.

US Airways Presses Pursuit of AMR Deal
By
Mike Spector and Jack Nicas Updated Dec. 7, 2012 5:30 p.m. ET
US Airways Group Inc. stepped up its campaign to combine with American Airlines parent AMR Corp. by sending a merger proposal last month, people close to the discussions said, as American's pilots on Friday approved a new contract that moves it closer to exiting bankruptcy. The merger proposal, sent in mid-November to AMR and its creditors, suggested an all-stock deal that would give American's creditors 70% of the new airline and US Airways shareholders 30%, the people close to the discussions said. That implies the...

Seldom does the emergence of a single individual undeniably change the course of history. It was true of Winston Churchill
becoming prime minister in May 1940, of course, but normally one person's efforts cannot significantly alter the tide of human events. Yet undoubtedly such a person was Margaret Thatcher,
for it is no exaggeration to say that she saved Great Britain from bankruptcy, made it great again, won a war and with Ronald Reagan
helped sound the death knell of Soviet communism. Yet her obituaries on both the left and the right hint that her battles were all in the past, that she was solely a figure from an earlier era, whose struggles bear no relation to today's politics. Nothing could be further from the truth. The principles that she established—which together form the coherent political program called Thatcherism—have perhaps more relevance now than at any time since the 1980s. To write her off as a historical figure is to discard the timelessness, and thus the most important aspect, of her political thought. Related Video

More Video on Margaret Thatcher With the U.N. Security Council plus Germany (the so-called P5+1) nowadays adopting what she once described in another context as "the politics of the pre-emptive cringe" toward Iran's development of a nuclear bomb, we could do with the late Lady Thatcher's clear-sighted and full-throated denunciation of pusillanimity in international affairs. When she was in power, her attitude toward dictatorships' threats and bullying—be it the Argentine junta over the Falkland Islands or Saddam Hussein
before the Gulf War—was precisely the tough and uncompromising stance from which the P5+1 group constantly shrinks. The advice she gave to President George H.W. Bush
in 1990—"This is no time to go wobbly, George"—is desperately needed today. Similarly, her support for Israel was lifelong and unwavering. When asked about anti-Semitism she said: "I simply did not understand it," and she denounced members of her own constituency association who excluded Jews from the local golf club. When asked in later life what her greatest single achievement was, she replied that it had come in the late 1930s, when she was 12 and raised money to help save a 17-year-old Austrian Jewish girl from the Nazis by bringing her to Britain. Margaret Thatcher hated deficits with all the power that a grocer's daughter might be expected to hate indebtedness. Despite inheriting a disastrous economy from the Labour Party in 1979—the top income-tax rate was 98% and public-sector strikes were crippling British industry—she managed to increase growth and productivity to such an extent that she could leave office with a top tax rate of 40% and growth rates mirroring those of her beloved America. Sadly, her mind slipped into the shadows in the early part of this century, otherwise it would have been highly enlightening to hear her opinion of the astronomical deficits being run by the Obama administration today. Similarly, it would be marvelous to hear her assess the state of the European Union today, as every one of her predictions of the dangers of economic and monetary union have been shown to be correct. Lord Salisbury
once said that the four cruellest words in the English language are "I told you so." How often did Margaret Thatcher tell Brussels and Europhiles that a system in which all European economies of whatever size, shape and type were strait-jacketed into uniform interest and exchange rates would inevitably fail? She saw the danger. Perhaps she could point the way out. When it was proposed that the British pound should give way to the euro, she memorably cried out in the House of Commons, "No! No! No!" Britons should look at Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy today and laud her for her foresight, yet it was over the question of European integration that she was ultimately defenestrated by a small but determined cabal within the Conservative Party. "Democracy isn't just about deducing what the people want," she once said. "Democracy is leading the people as well." How often does one see that in today's opinion-poll, focus-group-driven politics? Of the political U-turns that "the wets" within her own party so wanted in 1981, she told the Tory Party Conference: "You turn if you want to; the lady's not for turning." Unlike too many politicians today, she had a visceral sense of politics—and of right and wrong. On the bicentenary of the fall of the Bastille, for example, her guts told her that it was wrong to join the French in celebrating a revolution that brought bloodshed, war and republicanism, so she forbade the British ambassador to attend, amid much grinding of teeth in the Foreign Office. Can one imagine any modern politician making such a magnificent gesture today? Similarly she reveled in the abuse that her enemies directed at her. When the Soviet propaganda ministry pinned the label "Iron Lady" on her, it was meant to draw attention to her inflexibility. "Any leader has to have a certain amount of steel in them," she replied, "so I am not that put out being called the Iron Lady." How much does the West today need statesmen who treat personal popularity as an unimportant byproduct of the larger battles that they wish to fight, and who trust the people to re-elect them even if voters don't particularly like them? As someone who knew her well, I can attest that there was plenty to like as well as to admire in Margaret Thatcher, but she never put likability high on her list. She had a job to do. When a few years ago Hillary Clinton
likened herself to Margaret Thatcher, it would have been easy to accept what was certainly intended as a compliment, but instead Lady Thatcher expostulated: "She's not in the least like me; I know because I'm not in the least like her!" Now that Lady Thatcher is dead, we must not turn her into a mere cozy historical figure, shorn of the ideological convictions that are for the ages. Thatcherism will always remain, and the world is better for it. Mr. Roberts, a historian, was appointed by Margaret Thatcher as a Trustee of the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust. Email

Second Investor Urges Change at SandRidge
By
Ryan Dezember And Anupreeta Das Nov. 15, 2012 12:50 p.m. ET
Shareholder pressure is mounting on SandRidge Energy Inc. as another large stock owner joined in urging the Oklahoma City energy producer to shake up its board, replace Chief Executive Tom Ward and explore a sale. Investment firm Mount Kellett Capital Management LP, run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives, owns about 4.5% of SandRidge's shares. On Thursday the firm's chief operating officer, Jonathan Fiorello, wrote in a...

Two Iranian women walk past a missile display in Tehran on Sept. 25, 2011.
Associated Press You don't have to fire a nuclear weapon to gain a strategic advantage from it. This is perhaps the most important lesson from the decades of the Cold War. Yet many commentators on the possibility of a nuclear Iran overlook this truth and argue that we could handle this radically new situation. A nuclear Iran is usually discussed at a cosmic level of abstraction, in terms of deterrence and containment. But it needs to be examined from the bottom up, in concrete detail. War games, which have a long history in U.S. defense planning, are one way to do this. These simulations bring out insights that never show up in academic theories. Over the past five years, games featuring an Iran that possesses a small, crude nuclear arsenal have been played repeatedly by government officials, the military and outside strategic experts in the U.S. and Israel—games in which participants are assigned roles as decision makers in different countries—and I have been involved in several of them. The insights that have emerged from these exercises are not necessarily true, of course. They have to stand on their own merits. But I have not been encouraged by what I have seen. The game might begin with a seemingly familiar train of events, not unlike what has unfolded this week in the Middle East: The Shiite militant group Hezbollah kidnaps Israeli soldiers. Israel hits back with airstrikes on villages in Lebanon believed to be Hezbollah ammunition dumps. The West Bank and Gaza flare up, and Hezbollah begins firing long-range missiles into Haifa and Tel Aviv. The weapons come from Iran, and there are even Iranian "advisers" with them. But then the tempo of the game slows down. Everyone notices caution, even hesitation, in the Israel team. The Israelis refrain from airstrikes on Syria (Hezbollah's other key patron), and the Israeli navy backs off from the Lebanon-Syria coast for fear of losing a ship. If a ship were lost, Israel would have to escalate, and that is the heart of the matter: Escalation in a nuclear context isn't like escalation in earlier conflicts without the bomb. Israel knows how to escalate in a conventional war or against an intifada or insurgency. But this is different. The conflict is no longer about how much pain to inflict before the other side gives up. It is about risk. An unwanted spiral of escalation might drive the game in a very bad direction. The Israel team considers firing a demonstration nuclear shot, a missile warhead that would explode 100,000 feet over Tehran. Israeli plans since the 1970s have called for doing this as a last-ditch alternative to firing all-out atomic attacks. The blast would shatter windows in downtown Tehran, but it wouldn't kill anyone, or hardly anyone. Surely it would shock Iran into a cease-fire. But before that can happen, Iran ups the ante by declaring a full nuclear alert. Rockets on truck launchers are flushed from their peacetime storage bases, along with hundreds of conventionally armed rockets and shorter-range missiles that can hit U.S. bases throughout the Middle East. The Iran side in this game has given a great deal of thought to the political uses of its primitive nuclear arsenal. A few of its nuclear missiles are in hardened, underground silos. These are for quick-reaction firing, ready to launch on short notice. Mobile missiles can take hours to move and set up. Iran also understands the psychology of its enemies. The West does not want to kill millions of innocent people, so the Iran team places some mobile missiles in city parks in Tehran, Esfahan and Mashhad. Camouflage nets are placed over many parts of these cities to conceal the missiles and to mislead American satellites. To bring attention to their dire situation, the Israel team orders two Jericho missiles to go on alert. They are timed to move to their launch positions just as the U.S. satellites are passing overhead. The intent, obviously, is to shock the White House. "We hope it leaks to the media, too, maybe we should make sure it does," one member of the Israel team says. Israel's move forces a U.S. decision. Washington wants to restrain Israel, defend Israel and scare the living daylights out of Iran. So the U.S. publicly gives Israel a guarantee: If one atomic missile hits Israel, the U.S. announces, that would be it for Iran. The guarantee is cleverly worded. Maybe too cleverly. It doesn't specify which weapons America would use. The term nuclear refers only to Iran's attack on Israel. The U.S. hasn't fired an atomic bomb in anger since 1945. It hasn't conducted a realistic nuclear exercise since the end of the Cold War, and in this war game, the person playing the U.S. president says that he doesn't want to go down in history as the first leader to kill five million people in an afternoon. Some on the U.S. team call instead for a massive conventional strike, one that would destroy Iran's military power for decades. The person playing the president asks if Iran might simply sit back and watch such an attack unfold over several weeks. And he is angry: Why haven't better options and intelligence been developed over the years? Iran's bomb program isn't exactly a surprise, after all. It is the most closely watched in history. Why hadn't anybody thought about this before? The Iran team's next move jacks up the tensions to a fever pitch. Without saying anything, Iran evacuates its big cities. The urban population packs into buses, cars and trucks and rides out to distant suburbs and beyond. In a day, Iran's big cities are at 25% of their normal population. Iran is now poised to absorb a nuclear attack. Its missiles are on a hair trigger, and most of the country's population will survive an Israeli counterstrike. Israel, by contrast, is in chaos. There is nowhere for the Israelis to go. Ben Gurion Airport has been closed by rocket fire. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis are mobbing the coastal marinas, desperately trying to escape to Cyprus in small boats. TV shows the panic. Deterrence, and the myth of Israeli invincibility, the bedrock of Israeli security, is disappearing. Suddenly, Iran declares that, in the interest of world peace, it will step back from the brink, having exposed the true nature of "the Zionist nuclear entity." So the game ends. Nuclear war has been avoided. Deterrence worked. But who in Israel, the U.S. or Iran will claim that this was the real lesson? Iran had used a small nuclear force to undermine long-standing perceptions of Israeli military strength and to rupture the Middle East order. Among the U.S. and its allies, there is widespread agreement that Iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Some favor sanctions, some favor pre-emptive strikes, some favor espionage and sabotage. All agree, however, that a nuclear Iran would be a danger to the world. But despite everyone's best efforts, Iran may still get the bomb. Then what? American strategic planning has avoided this uncomfortable question, but we can no longer afford to keep our heads in the sand. —Mr. Bracken, a professor of management and political science at Yale, is the author of "The Second Nuclear Age: Strategy, Danger and the New Power Politics" (Times Books), from which this article is adapted.

Updated March 20, 2008 12:01 a.m. ET
This month our cable company added an extra layer of security to access account information online. I received a letter with a new security code that I had to plug into my online account before the site would allow me to log on with my existing user name and password. Once logged in, I was allowed to change the new security code to my own password. Great. Another password to remember. The cable company has now joined banks, brokerages, retailers and the cellphone company in trying to improve the security of my online accounts by forcing me to remember a mind-boggling combination of codes, symbols and answers to personal security questions. (What's your favorite color? The name of your first pet? The make and model of your first car?) Talk With Terri
How do you manage your online passwords? What formula do you use to create tough-to-crack codes? Join me and your fellow readers in a discussion about choosing and remembering online security passwords.
It's frustrating for consumers -- but research indicates these added layers of protection work. "There's no doubt that it's preventing attacks -- each layer that's added reduces the possibility" that someone can commit fraud, says Edward Kountz of JupiterResearch. That said, he says the extra hurdles are designed to reassure customers that their accounts are secure as much as they are aimed at improving security. Regardless, remembering all of these security codes can be daunting. To combat password fatigue, I needed a new system for managing my passwords. So what goes into creating a secure password these days? First, let's talk about what shouldn't go into it. Avoid the obvious -- choose passwords that don't include easy-to-obtain information, such as birthdays, anniversaries, your pet's name, maiden names, etc. Hackers use programs that search for words in the dictionary, so avoid those. And choose different passwords for multiple sites -- your personal email account should not share a password with your 401(k) account. For years I created passwords using tips from my Journal colleague Jeremy Wagstaff, who counseled readers to base their passwords on mnemonics or acronyms, not words or names. I'd choose something that few people know about me. For example, during my college years I briefly worked as a gas-station attendant, and one hot day a flirtatious customer offered me beer to keep cool. A fun, easy-to-remember anecdote for a secure password would be Women Gas Station Attendants Drink Lots of Beer, or WGSADLOB. (Forget it, hackers -- I never actually used that one.) Still, that password's not good enough. To make it more difficult to crack, it needs a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, punctuation marks and symbols. But that also makes it more difficult to remember. To help me memorize the password, I'd use numbers that look like letters (the @ sign for A and $ for S, for instance), and symbols that resemble letters (\/\/ for W, and () for O, and so on). So WGSADLOB would become \/\/g$@DL()b. Once I created a password, I'd drill it into my memory by logging into the site regularly for several days until I no longer struggled to remember the characters. That worked fine when I had only a handful of accounts, and those accounts only required one password each. Today, my old system isn't keeping up with the growing number of sites that require multiple passwords. So to keep my sanity, I've changed my habits. Now, instead of using a different mnemonic or acronym for each Web site, I have a core password that I use to build up a unique password for each site. In addition to the core password, I tack on something to identify the site and something that describes it. For example, if I visit my Bank of America checking account, my password might be BOA\/\/g$@DL()b. Toss in some symbols and numbers and you get B0@\/\/g$@DL()b. Some Web sites have limits on the kinds of characters and symbols you can choose, so I'd sometimes have to play around with the letters and symbols to get the right mix. When the time comes to update the password I generally keep the same "word" for each site but mix up the numbers, symbols and letters: B0@\/\/g$@DL()b becomes B*@Wg$ADL0b. Again, after I've changed passwords I make sure to sign on several times until the new password is drilled into my brain. Right now only a few sites require you to choose a graphic to identify your computer, but their numbers are growing. Symbols are easy enough to remember, and even passwords can be mastered, but I often find myself stumped by the answers to sites' security questions. Too often, I choose an answer to a security question and have forgotten it by the time I visit a month later. (For my first car, did I say "Mustang"? Or "Ford Mustang"?) And I admit, there are a few personal security questions I've needed Google's help to answer (What was your high school's team mascot? The Chargers? The Knights? Oh, yeah! Go Rams!). Even when I don't need Google, some questions have multiple answers. (I went to three elementary schools.) I would sometimes need several tries to get my answers right -- and some systems would lock me out after too many incorrect answers. To stop getting stuck, I now only answer questions that aren't up for interpretation: My father's middle name won't change, but my favorite food might. I also avoid questions that could be answered in different ways. (For that elementary-school question, is the answer "PS 8" or P.S. #8?) I do my best to keep track of passwords on my own, but many people have given up and turned to password-management software to encrypt and store their information. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea of turning all of my sensitive financial data over to any storage service, or using encryption software to store this information on my computer. But if you find it impossible to keep track of everything and want to give password management a try, this TopTenReviews, a technology-review site, breaks down the features and cost of the major providers here. Jason Rafail, Awareness and Collaboration Liaison at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center, cautions against using any software application that stores and automatically fills in user names and passwords. "If your system were compromised, this application may provide easy access to all of your accounts for intruders," he says. Likewise, he says, using a password-vault application may pose a similar risk. If any intruders compromise the machine, they may only need the password to the vault to gain access to all your account information, he says. Instead, Mr. Rafail recommends storing passwords in an encrypted file on media not connected to the computer system, such as a flash drive or memory stick. "This media should then only be connected and used when the user requires assistance in recalling credentials, and then disconnected when that information is no longer required." That said, these items need to be carefully guarded so they're not lost or stolen. Then there's my husband Gerry's method: He avoids the Internet, and the passwords required of them, whenever possible. He's never surfed the Web, sent an email, or composed a computer document. (The man doesn't even read my columns.) Gerry's work doesn't require computer skills, and though he'd like to learn some basic skills, we haven't found the time to sit down for a tutorial. When Gerry does need to do something online -- typically, comparison-shopping for boating equipment -- I do the clicking as he shoulder-surfs. Since I manage most of our financial accounts, the only password he needs to remember is the personal identification number on his debit card. It makes his life easier, but because I manage most of our finances, Gerry could face hassles accessing our accounts if anything happened to me. To protect him, I break one of the major rules of password protection: I write passwords down. But I think I'm reasonably careful: The complete list of our account numbers and their corresponding passwords, security answers and symbols sits in our safe-deposit box, along with our estate-planning documents. I update the list once a year (when I do our taxes), after I've changed the account passwords on all of our financial accounts. Security experts say passwords should be updated regularly -- at least once every two or three months -- but, honestly, I don't have the time to do that. Instead, I fall back on keeping my accounts secure by making my passwords as complex as possible, without taxing my memory to the limit. And there are no absolute guarantees: Security experts say determined hackers can break any password if they set their minds to it. Still, by taking the time to create a complex password, and making at least some effort to change the codes regularly, I feel I'm doing most everything I can to keep data thieves out of my financial accounts. But if there are any hackers out there who want to break into my cable account and pay my bill, have at it. How do you manage your online passwords? What formula do you use to create tough-to-crack codes? Write to me at fiscallyfit@wsj.com, and then come join me in a discussion about managing passwords.
