If I were in a battleground state, I would vote for Romney - just in case.But since I live in CA my vote is "reliably worthless", and I will vote for Gary Johnson.

The popular vote does count, because it affects how much of a mandate the winner can claim. And the comparison will be between Obama's numbers and Romney's numbers, ignoring third parties, unfortunately.The bigger Obama's margin if he wins, the more he'll be able to claim a mandate to double down on his move towards a government controlled economy. The bigger Romney's margin if he wins, the better a chance he'll have of repealing Obamacare and the rest of Obama's broken legacy.I urge you to vote for Romney, even in California.

That's nice in theory. In reality, the number of votes in Congress determines how much of a mandate you have, as George W. Bush seemed to have a huge one despite losing the popular vote.

All day long would I take Romney over Obama. Don't get me wrong. At the same time, he has a long way to go to prove that he isn't another all talk, big spending Republican. Picking Ryan as a running mate is a start, but that is more word than deed. And, the man has never apologized for Romneycare. Just because it was constitutional at the state level, doesn't mean it was a good idea. Nevertheless, If I lived in Ohio, I would be marking the checkbox next to Romney - just to be sure.But since I live on the left coast, I am sure. There is no chance my vote will count unless Sandy 2.0 wipes out the Western seaboard (and leaving the central valley intact) in the next 5 days. My vote is not one in a million, but one in a hundred million, and the only votes that really count - are made by members of the electoral college.On the other hand ... I have two reasons to vote for Gary Johnson. It is an economic decision in that my vote in this state is one in a million. A small number to be sure, but 100 times more valuable than a vote for Romney. And it is a helps that party in future elections. When certain voting thresholds are passed, some financial and regulatory hurdles are removed.The other, and more important, reason is philosophy. Gary Johnson has already demonstrated he would fix what is wrong with this country better than mild-mannered Mitt. The "other former-governor" vetoed over 700 bills while in office and eliminated 10,000 government jobs. His legislature got the message though, and they did pass laws that were not the pork-ridden and rent-seeking monstrosities that we see everywhere else at the state and federal levels.

Because all of that is true of Romney too, except possibly the exact count of government jobs - Weld had already gotten the public employment picture under control previously.

Sorry, but I don't count "line-item vetos" as individual items.Quote from Wikipedia: "During his tenure as governor, Johnson adhered to a stringent anti-tax and anti-bureaucracy policy driven by a cost–benefit analysis rationale, setting state and national records for his use of veto powers more than the other 49 contemporary governors put together."

Voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson. Live in a battleground state (Virginia) and this upsets both the Democrats and Republicans. Obama has done a poor job...as did George W.. Romney will only slow the bleeding and not fix the problems. Obama or Romney we are down the same road only at mildly differnent speeds. The country is devaluing its currency, embedded in crony capitalism, and fighting worthless wars. This is an Orwellian state. Medicare, the deficit, Social Security..these aren't fixed under Romney's plan. In addition Romney's treatment of Ron Paul at the Rep. Convention and trying to get Gary Johnson off the ballot in Virginia only confirmed my vote. We are in a bad state...so bad that the candidate that wants to shrink government, follow the Constitution, and have increased freedom in society is a radical.

The Titanic is sinking and we have two choices sink and drown or try plugging the ship and make it home. Neither way will the initial objective of the cruise be met.Some might say neither course will meet my objective so let the ship sink. "Romney will only slow the bleeding "The alternative choice leaves us with a chance, but some would prefer Gary Johnson to Romney. That's fair enough since I think Gary Johnson would make a good choice, but for the next 4 years all Gary Johnson could do would be to slow the bleeding just like Romney. It sounds like some don't want to expend the effort of slowing the bleeding preferring to end it all now and let the ship sink. Have libertarians become suicidal?

Mr. Thompson, can you imagine the Democrat adds if Gov Romney articulated specific plans (even if such were reasonable since Congress has to be intimately involved)? If Obama wins he will have nothing to lose. He'll go into hyperdrive to push his leftist agenda and will use Federal agencies and executive orders to do it. Think it was bad his first term? Just wait. He'll make sure there are so many more people dependent on government, that we'll never be able to go back.Romney wasn't my first choice, but he is our only option at this point. .This may be the last chance to stop the trajectory we seem so miserably headed in. Please reconsider.

Romney. I'm also volunteering for Romney from 5:15am to midnight on election day.The reasons for replacing Obama should be clear to all. My detailed research into Romney indicates that he would be much better than those who only read press accounts would believe. His tax and budget plans would result in a substantial recovery, rather than continuing to drag along the bottom under Obama, and he would be an excellent president in other ways as well.

I am not sure. I like Johnson a lot better. Romney is for me a vote against Obama, which is important, but why do we always have to vote against someone and not for? I am in Florida.

I am pretty sure that if you vote against Obama this time, you'll be voting for Romney in 4 years. And in Florida, where the outcome is in doubt, Romney really does need your vote.

Well, I do not expect Obama to win here anyways. Thats because there is a huge difference in my observations now vs. four yers ago: lots of Romney signs, hardly any for Obama, same with stickers. Young people seem to be very quiet this time - looks like Obama is not "cool" anymore. Obama supporters do not talk anymore, almost like they want to avoid being labeled. A bunch of people known to me, who voted last time for Obama, clearly declared their change of opinion. So in other words it does not seem that Romney "needs" my vote.On the other hand I feel that it is time for Libertarians to start playing a role on the national stage, particulary after the publicity they got, courtesy of Ron Paul.Hence my dillemma.

Mr. Chrostowski, your area may well be more for Romney, but you can't speak for the whole state. Polls are too close to call.Please reconsider. This may be our last chance to change the path we are on.

Romney is slightly favored in Florida, but Obama still has a substantial chance. For example, out of the last 10 polls, 7 had Romney in the lead, but 3 had Obama in the lead. And the trend in the last couple of weeks, looking at the graphs, is toward Obama:http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/fl/florida_romney_vs_obama-1883.htmlAs Catherine says, different parts of Florida are different. The Romney lawn signs may be out in your part, but you can bet the Obama supporters are knocking on doors in their areas. Romney does still need your vote.I do agree that libertarians need to start taking a role. I also agree that Ron Paul made a good start in that direction. Notably, he did so by working within the Republican party, and many of tomorrow's generation of Republican leaders will have been brought in by Ron Paul. I think we need to continue that path.For example, I've collected a couple hundred followers on Google+ by dint of posting on Romney threads. You can bet that after the election, I'll be putting posts into their streams gently nudging them towards the libertarian end of the Republican spectrum. I'll probably also change my registration from independent to Republican so I can run for my precinct's Republican committee, from where I can contribute to shifting the state party towards a more clearly libertarian stance.I think that path - Ron Paul's path of working through the Republican party - is the only realistic way to work towards a more libertarian nation. However, I think that also means voting for Romney in this election where it counts, which includes Florida.Thanks for hearing me out.

@WarrenThat sounds all well and good, but I wonder if there will ever be an election where you say anything other than, "This Democrat is the greatest threat we have ever faced, therefore you must vote for whoever the Republicans give us."@LeszekAlso, realize that there are "Big L" and "small l" libertarians, and you might be just as happy being the latter.

Warren, I like your perspective at this point in history. By staying in the Republican Party and advocating more libertarian policies I believe Ron Paul has been successful. I am hoping to see a further shift in this direction, however, if it moves towards the spending Republicans of the past I am gone."I've collected a couple hundred followers on Google+ by dint of posting on Romney threads."I am unfamiliar with what you are saying.Re Florida: I think Florida will go for Romney, but then I have felt Romney might very well have a bigger win than expected based upon the polls. In certain democratic areas, anecdotally I have noted that a good number of people that voted for Obama will not be doing so again. However, those that do not vote for Romney because he doesn't meet all their needs or because of their disappointment with the Republican Party are fooling themselves. This is a crucial election and a vote for Obama is voting against positive change probably for a decade or so. Right now it is imperative that we stop the bleeding.

Randy, in 2008, I saw McCain as just as much a threat to liberty as I thought Obama was then - I was not then pushing anyone to vote for the Republican. Then Obama turned out to be far, far worse than expected, which is the reason for my heightened concern this time around.

I am voting for Gary Johnson. I live in New Jersey which is reliably blue, but I'd do the same in Ohio. I'd even do the same if I were Kevin Kostner from that movie a few years ago.This will be the first time I have actually voted for someone on the ballot, as I've found all other candidates since I was eligible to vote to be unfit for office. It's nice to actually have someone worth voting for for once.

Of course, the best choice , rather the only one is Obama who possesses all the requisite positive traits of a good and effective leader in this 21st century world that enabled him to retrieve America out of a series of quagmires, created by myopic, self-centered and dogmatic Bush

Obama realized the Bush wasn't wasting enough money and lives in Afghanistan, so he tripled our commitment to that pointless war. At least, I think that's what mohammad is talking about.

Without praising Bush who created a lot of problems I note all the words you say are in praise, but none provide examples. That is hollow rhetoric something that Obama is famous for.

Mr. Chaudhry, what positive traits are you referring to? He shows no leadership and he has no respect for the Constitution that he has sworn to uphold. He is the president of a country he does not believe in.

The greedy alternative is one that practices vulture capitalism to fatten his own pockets and doesn't care much about his country either. If he did, he would have gone to serve in Vietnam, in the jungles, to defend it against the Commie "menace" that was Vietnam, not conveniently prance around in the idyllic French countryside, spreading a divine message about a being that promises clueless imbeciles three imaginary heavens and private planets upon expiration. If he cared about his country he wouldn't have preyed on its moribund companies' failures, loaded them with debt, scavenged them, and then sold them down the river and left their former employees jobless and destitute. You fool no one. Of the two evils, he is by far a greater and more dangerous one, at least as far as I am concerned.

Jose: Romney, who contributed $3 million a year to charity, is not the greedy one. The greedy one is Obama, who socks the future taxpayer with trillion dollar deficits to pay off his own political constituencies.

Note how Jose is left to making up new fictional names, 'vulture capitalism' to demonize a successful economic system. Why does he do that? Because he is unable to articulate an intelligent response.

There is no question George Bush is a traitor and should be tried for Treason. That MassBama inherited a bad situation is a fact. But, it is also a fact that he made it worse, not better.

I'm voting for Mitt Romney and if my fellow Americans vote for four more years of hell under the Obama regime, I will never, ever, forgive you. NEVER!!!

Agreed. If Johnson manages to flip the election to Obama, many of us who are philosophically libertarian will come to view the Libertarian Party as an enemy, rather than as an ally.

There is no way a third party candidate will win. Writing-in Big Bird on the ballot will have the same effect.

@WarrenIf Obama wins, I HOPE that it's by a margin less than Johnson's vote count in any given swing state. I would consider punishing the GOP for picking Romney to be a positive thing that I would be proud to have participated in.@MariaThe odds that a single vote for Big Bird or Johnson will swing an election are no different than a single vote for Obamney.

It is a misconception that voting LP only takes away from the RP. My coworker is voting LP, but if not for Gary Johnson, she would vote for MassaBama. My choice is between the LP and not voting, but if someone held a gun to my head and said I had to vote for MassaBama or Robomney, I would vote for MassaBama. My family feels the same way. We will never vote for anyone in the GOP.

Steven Poole's New Book, 'You Aren't What You Eat,' Looks at Our Gastronomic Obsession

Updated Oct. 12, 2012 7:07 a.m. ET
A friend recently attended an official lunch at Buckingham Palace, where he chatted to the queen, who mentioned that Prince Philip spent much of his spare time watching food programs. Amid this gastronomic obsession at all levels of society, a new book appears this week that posits that food has replaced drugs as the "last ingestible substance that you can indulge in with fanatical obsessiveness without being frowned on by society." Enlarge Image
'You Aren't What You Eat: Fed Up with Gastroculture' by Steven Poole (Union Books).
"You Aren't What You Eat" by Steven Poole (Union Books) is subtitled "Fed Up with Gastroculture." It claims that the prevailing interest in food "represents a kind of perversity or decadence, an inward-turning dissipation of psychic and intellectual resources," adding that society now places more faith in what cooks say on how to live than in what politicians and clergy have to say on the matter. It isn't often that I come across a book where I strenuously disagree with every single conclusion it makes. But "You Aren't What You Eat" is one. And its author, a British journalist, acknowledges that before he decided to write this polemic, he never spent much time thinking about food or felt the need to watch food programs. Yet in his third book, Mr. Poole accuses celebrity chefs of trying to pretend they have a greater role in life than merely "spraying froth at a few rich people." Famous chefs, however, cannot be blamed for answering questions about their beliefs about food or for having more trenchant views about their own profession than most people. Among other musings, Mr. Poole implies that organic farming is a con. But his arguments completely ignore the main selling point of organic produce—which is not necessarily that they offer superior flavor but that they lack harmful pesticides. And his argument regarding the hypocrisy of food lovers not bothering to consume the remainder of the goose despite using their fat is akin to blaming consumers who use beef dripping for not purchasing the rest of the cow as well. Mr. Poole never feels the need to describe meals, only mentioning one dining experience in the entire book. Here again, there was a problem; it was at Heston Blumenthal's Dinner, which purports to re-create historic recipes in a contemporary setting. This approach is peremptorily dismissed by Mr. Poole because "you can't taste the past because you are not in the past." “
It isn't often that I come across a book where I strenuously disagree with every single conclusion it makes. But "You Aren't What You Eat" is one.
”
And he claims that the primary aim of the nouvelle cuisine in the 1960s was "to make grub look pretty." This overlooks the impact caused by the movement, which revolutionized the use of lighter sauces and introduced fresher and more seasonal ingredients—an influence that continues to this day in what are now considered the pillars of French cuisine. "The ideological mainstream in our day," meanwhile, are Modernist Cuisine publishers such as Nathan Myhrvold. In fact, the fashion for molecular gastronomy has already peaked and been replaced by New Nordic cuisine, which emphasizes its origins and seasonality. It is a pity that an important topic like contemporary food mores, which deserves serious study, is treated so rhetorically. The book also includes far too many glib statements: food is the new sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll; food is the new art; food is the new religion. In reality, there has been a divergence in recent times between mass entertainment using food and a growth in personal blogging about recipes and restaurants. There is no common ground between these groups; one is primarily escapist entertainment, while the other is focused on individual accomplishment. Mr. Poole has critically overlooked the growth of food knowledge throughout the Western world and the overall improvement of food at all levels. There has never been a better period to experience quality and innovative food dishes. This is the positive result of the growing passion for food, rather than a collection of grumblings about how self-indulgent this diverse movement is.

Jason Motte
Associated Press Even Rally Squirrels Should Fear the Beard Different year. Different beard. Same results. Through three games of the National League Championship Series, St. Louis closer Jason Motte has put on a Brian Wilson-esque performance in the post-season, allowing just a single hit and no runs in 5 2/3 innings. But Motte swears the facial hair has nothing to do with Wilson, whose beard was the focal point of the San Francisco Giants' "Fear the Beard" rallying cry last October. "I've had a beard or a goatee since I got called up," said Motte, now in his fourth season with the Cardinals. —Matthew Futterman Enlarge Image
Bill Clinton, left, with President Obama
Bloomberg News On the Links, Obama Has the Bragging Rights Bill Clinton, looking fit after losing 25 pounds because of his "near" vegan diet, told reporters at his Harlem office Thursday that President Barack Obama bested his score of 92 in their golf match Sept. 24 at Andrews Air Force Base. "He might have won by a shot or two. I was just terrible that day, but I had such a good time," Clinton said. As a way of promoting wellness, the William J. Clinton Foundation and Humana Inc. earlier this year signed an eight-year contract to sponsor the Humana Challenge, formerly the Bob Hope Classic, in Palm Springs, Calif. —John Paul Newport A Loss the Redskins Would Rather Forget The Washington Redskins have given up 63 points in four games this season, making it a little hard to believe the team gave up 59 points last November to the Philadelphia Eagles. Sometimes, NFL teams use the memory of bad games to motivate them for next time. Then there are the games that are so bad they are better off forgotten. "There's nothing to study from it," said Redskins defensive coordinator Jim Haslett when questioned at Thursday's news conference on the blowout loss. "I can't even talk about it," he finally said. The teams play at FedEx Field Sunday. —Reed Albergotti Seeing Red: England Will Be Without Rooney Wayne Rooney was handed a three-match suspension Thursday by European soccer's governing body UEFA after being sent off in England's final Euro 2012 qualifier Oct. 7. If the ruling is upheld, the Manchester United striker would miss all of England's group-stage games at next summer's tournament. Coach Fabio Capello must decide whether to even include Rooney on the 23-man squad, in hopes the team advances. Rooney's absence could lead to a recall for Peter Crouch or Jermain Defoe, or the inclusion of youngsters Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck if they continue to impress in the Premier League. —Joe E.

February 15, 2012
Philadelphia In June 1882, Vincent van Gogh learned that the great German painter Albrecht Dürer had used a perspective screen—an empty picture frame strung with a series of crosshairs—as an aid to composing images from nature. Van Gogh soon acquired one, employing adjustable poles to stabilize it in the sand as he sketched along the beach at Scheveningen, outside The Hague. Guidelines corresponding to the perspective screen's divisions can be seen in his drawings from later years, when he was living in France, suggesting that he still relied on the device to work out the spectacular foreshortening effects that characterized some of his best pictures of that period, such as "The Harvest" (1888), painted near Arles. Sun-drenched stalks of wheat dominate the foreground, while distant fields recede in a geometric quilt of greens and yellows to the high horizon, near the very top of the canvas. Writing to his brother Theo, Van Gogh compared this image to ones by the 17th-century Dutch painter Philips de Koninck, who often composed landscapes from an unconventional, downward-tilted viewpoint. Van Gogh Up Close Philadelphia Museum of Art Through May 6, then travels to the National Gallery of Canada "Van Gogh Up Close," an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, focuses on the artist's mature tendency to push landscape and still-life motifs dramatically forward in the picture plane, yielding images cropped and arranged in radical, often miraculously unexpected ways. Room after room of sumptuous paintings from Van Gogh's French years, ablaze with the most brilliant colors of nature, offer endless visual fascination. But the show, which unfortunately does not include "The Harvest," has little to say about the perspective screen or De Koninck; instead, it presents abundant material on 19th-century nature photography's possible influence on Van Gogh—a peculiar issue to emphasize, given that the painter expressed outspoken disdain for photography. The result is the Paris Hilton of art exhibitions—extremely attractive but not especially noteworthy for its intellectual insights. 'Undergrowth with Two Figures' (1890), by Vincent van Gogh.
Cincinnati Art Museum The exhibition—organized by Philadelphia Museum curators Joseph J. Rishel and Jennifer A. Thompson, in collaboration with Anabelle Kienle, a curator at the National Gallery of Canada, and Cornelia Homburg, a Van Gogh scholar—opens with two small rooms of still lifes, most of them luscious pictures, although many have little to do with the theme of the show. "Sunflowers" (1888 or 1889), from Philadelphia's own collection, is a virtuoso performance in color harmony, showing a ceramic vase of perky yellow blossoms against a swirling cerulean background, but it is entirely orthodox from a compositional standpoint, as the vase sits squarely in the middle distance at eye level. More aptly chosen is a second sunflower image of 1887 from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting two slightly wilted blossoms lying on a rich ultramarine blue tablecloth. The artist's point of view is elevated and extremely tight, so that the flowers appear much larger than life-size; the thick, springy yellow brushstrokes of the petals seem almost to leap off the canvas. The still lifes are a warm-up for the exhibition's main event: four large galleries of landscapes, the best of which give a splendid impression of Van Gogh's mercurial, impassioned genius. It is here that one really sees the artist applying the lessons of Dürer's screen, stretching and bending perspectives to isolate details like sheaves of wheat, underbrush on the forest floor or raindrops pelting a freshly tilled field. The exhibition includes pictures lent by museums from around the world—Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland—as well as select private collections. But perhaps the greatest star of the show comes from the Cincinnati Art Museum, "Undergrowth with Two Figures" (1890), a stunning work that has been cleaned for the occasion and looks just as fresh as if it had been painted yesterday. Rhythmic starbursts of green, white and yellow brushstrokes race across the horizontal canvas, punctuated by the silver-gray verticals of evenly spaced tree trunks. The strolling man and woman mentioned in the title are easy to miss, but once seen they add an unmistakable note of foreboding to the composition. Where the show falls down is in the largest of the landscape galleries, flanked on two sides by alcoves containing background material. One alcove displays a dozen 19th-century nature photographs marketed to artists as source images; there's no evidence that Van Gogh used these, and the curators' argument that he would still have been influenced by them is too speculative to merit the outsize presentation. The other alcove is filled with Japanese prints, most by Utagawa Hiroshige, an apt point of reference for Van Gogh, as he collected such items. Hiroshige's high viewpoints, abrupt croppings and keen interest in the changing seasons influenced Van Gogh, as well as Claude Monet and other artists of the era. But it is unclear why so many prints are needed to demonstrate this fairly simple and well-known connection. These alcoves would have been a good place to introduce additional issues: the perspective screen, which would be a nice item to display and fairly easy to reconstruct based on Van Gogh's drawings of it from his letters; the precedents for Van Gogh's compositional strategies in commercial illustrations, a question discussed in the show's catalog but not represented in the exhibits; and the inspiration Van Gogh drew from earlier European art. That last subject receives brief attention in a narrow hallway at the end of the show, leading to the gift shop, but the few prints on view seem to have been chosen as much for their familiar names—Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Théodore Rousseau, Jacob van Ruisdael—as for apposite formal comparisons. The curators don't do a particularly good job teaching art history, but this is nonetheless a very handsome show, installed with great sensitivity to harmonious visual groupings. While it would be preferable to have brains and beauty in one package, the exhibition is worth seeing for the beauty alone. The pictures, after all, speak for themselves.
