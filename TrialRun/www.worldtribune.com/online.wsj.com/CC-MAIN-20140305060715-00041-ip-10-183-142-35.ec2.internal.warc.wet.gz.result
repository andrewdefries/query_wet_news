Ante la escasez de los operadores, los bulldozers se automatizan Artículo

Por JAMES R. HAGERTY CARTERSVILLE, Georgia, EE.UU.—Los bulldozers se utilizan para nivelar la tierra para carreteras y pistas de aterrizaje o para dar relieve a la superficie de terrenos de construcción o canchas de golf. Están entre los tipos de maquinaria pesada más difíciles de operar, ya que los conductores deben remover grandes montañas de tierra para formar contornos exactos, a menudo desde una posición inclinada o atascados en el lodo. A diferencia de las excavadoras, los bulldozers normalmente están en movimiento mientras mueven la tierra. Operadores hábiles pueden ser difíciles de hallar. Por eso la japonesa Komatsu Ltd. y sus grandes rivales estadounidenses, como Caterpillar Inc. y Deere & Co., están procurando hacer que los bulldozers y otras máquinas sean más fáciles de operar. Ha sido un proceso largo. Desde hace décadas, los controles hidráulicos eliminaron la necesidad de usar el embrague y la barra de cambios manuales. Ahora, las cabinas son cerradas y tienen aire acondicionado. Enlarge ImageClose
Raymond McCrea Jones para The Wall Street Journal
Las nuevas máquinas vienen con sistemas de GPS.
En la última década, los fabricantes han incorporado controles electrónicos cada vez más sofisticados, incluyendo sistemas de GPS que pueden ser programados para labrar una parcela de tierra y dejarla a sólo centímetros de un plano generado digitalmente. "Todos están intentando hacer que estas máquinas sean más fáciles de operar, ya que se está volviendo más y más difícil encontrar conductores" con las habilidades requeridas, dice Frank Manfredi, un consultor de la industria. Lo que está de por medio es un mercado global de bulldozers que el año pasado facturó unos US$5.900 millones, o 28.100 máquinas, según Off-Highway Research, una consultora de Londres. Sus sistemas de control GPS, que son mucho más sofisticados que los de los autos, vienen de proveedores como Trimble Navigation Ltd., de EE.UU., y Topcon Corp., de Japón. En una feria comercial realizada en abril, Komatsu presentó un modelo llamado D61 PXi-23 que incorpora un sistema GPS de Topcon. En un centro estadounidense de capacitación de Komatsu en Cartersville, en el estado de Georgia, tuve la oportunidad de probar la máquina. Al igual que en un auto, se usa una llave para encender el bulldozer. Pero no tiene volante. En su lugar, una palanca en el lado izquierdo controla la dirección y la velocidad. A la derecha, hay otra palanca que se usa para mover la cuchilla. Al subirme a la cabina, tenía dos pantallas delante de mí. La de abajo me ofrecía más información de lo que podía comprender sobre las operaciones de la máquina y me proporcionó una imagen trasera muy útil cuando metía reversa. La pantalla superior me permitía controlar la cuchilla de casi cuatro metros y confirmar que estaba programada para realizar la tarea del momento. Jason Anetsberger, gerente de producto de Komatsu, me explicó mi primera tarea: reducir en exactamente 30 centímetros la elevación de un terreno del tamaño de una pista de boliche. Giré el dial de velocidad al nivel máximo, quité el freno, bajé la cuchilla y tambaleé hacia adelante. En cuestión de segundos, me detuve por completo. La cuchilla estaba atorada en la tierra y el motor de 168 caballos de fuerza batallaba. La máquina no podía avanzar. Puse el freno y coloqué la palanca en neutro. Anetsberger me explicó que no debería haber mantenido la palanca abajo después de moverla hacia adelante para bajar la cuchilla. La máquina pensó que estaba intentando invalidar los controles automáticos y por eso descendió más de lo necesario. Poco después de otros intentos fallidos, ya me sentía como Bob el Constructor. La cuchilla peinaba el lodo en olas que se apilaban, se desmoronaban y luego podía aplanar de manera ordenada. Logré labrar una pista bastante plana. Anetsberger me dijo que, con algunas horas más de práctica, podría ser contratado como operador. Michael Baker, propietario de Cast & Baker Corp., que prepara sitios de construcción en cinco estados, no estaba tan convencido. Me dijo que prefería operadores experimentados con conocimientos de mecánica y que mis posibilidades de ser contratado eran bajas.

MOSCOW—Fugitive former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden's
father arrived in Moscow to a media maelstrom Thursday, and said he believed his son is prepared to remain in Russia for the long haul with no intention of returning to America. Fugitive former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden's father arrived in Moscow to a media maelstrom Thursday, and said he believed his son is prepared to remain in Russia for the long haul with no intention of returning to the U.S. Lukas Alpert reports.
Lon Snowden
was met by a crush of television reporters outside the VIP hall of Sheremetyevo Airport shortly after arriving from New York aboard Aeroflot Flight No. 101 early Thursday morning and said he wanted to see his son as soon as possible. Enlarge Image
In a handout photo from Sunshine Press, which is affiliated with WikiLeaks, Edward Snowden, third from right, receives the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence Award. He is pictured with U.K. WikiLeaks activist Sarah Harrison, third from left, and the U.S. government whistleblowers who presented the award. From left to right Coleen Rowley (FBI), Thomas Drake (NSA), Jesselyn Raddack (DOJ) and Ray McGovern (CIA) on Wednesday in Moscow.
SunshinePress/Getty Images "I hope to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options," he said, with his son's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena,
standing at his side. "I am not sure my son will be returning to the U.S., but that is his decision. He is an adult. I cannot speak for my son." Mr. Kucherena, who has served as the younger Mr. Snowden's go-between with reporters since he arrived in Russia, said he would try to arrange a meeting between the father and son later Thursday afternoon at a secret location. The elder Mr. Snowden had said he hoped to avoid a media circus when he arrived in Russia, but was whisked to the studio of the country's state-run 24-hour news channel where he and Mr. Kucherena gave a live interview that lasted for the better part of an hour. Mr. Snowden, looking tired from the nine-hour overnight flight, said he had traveled on a multiple-entry visa and intended to return to Russia as he expected his son wouldn't be leaving any time soon. "I hope to come to Russia many times. I do think my son, even though he hasn't told me this yet, will remain in Russia," he said in the interview aired on Rossiya-24, during which the program's anchor referred to the younger Mr. Snowden as a "hero." Later on Thursday, a group of well-known American whistleblowers and antisecrecy advocates appeared on Russia's state-run English language news channel RT, to announce that they had held a secret meeting with Edward Snowden in Russia on Wednesday to give him an award for "truth telling." "He's made his peace with what he did. He's convinced that what he did was right. He has no regrets and he is ready to face whatever the future holds for him," said Ray McGovern,
a former officer with the Central Intelligence Agency who has become a political activist. Mr. Kucherena, who enjoys close ties with the Kremlin and Russia's security service, said that the admitted leaker of top-secret U.S. surveillance programs has received numerous job offers in Russia, where he has been granted temporary political asylum, and is close to making a decision between working in information technology or on human rights. He also said Mr. Snowden has been working hard to learn Russian. Pavel Durov,
the founder of Russian social-media website VKontakte, had publicly offered Mr. Snowden a job shortly after his arrival, and said Thursday that he was still ready to hire him. "There was an offer and it still stands," he said, adding that he hadn't yet heard back from Mr. Snowden or his lawyer. "I think that first and foremost his opinion will be of importance. What tasks interests him, what kind of work schedule suits him." Mr. Kucherena said that Mr. Snowden, who has been in hiding at an undisclosed location in Russia since being granted temporary political asylum on Aug. 1, remains under a significant security threat and noted that five cars had followed the vehicle carrying the elder Mr. Snowden from the airport. "It is not good for the American government for the truth to come out," Mr. Kucherena said. The elder Mr. Snowden had been planning the trip to Russia since his son received asylum, but the journey was repeatedly delayed because of what he described as security concerns. Mr. Kucherena has said while his client lives under heavy guard, he is able to walk freely in the streets in disguise. Lon Snowden, a retired Coast Guard officer from Allentown, Pa., said he had been in regular contact with Mr. Kucherena before the trip but hasn't had direct contact with his son since April. Mr. Snowden said he was "extremely thankful" to Mr. Kucherena and Russian President Vladimir Putin
for helping his son. The 30-year-old former National Security Agency contractor had spent more than five weeks in the transit zone at Sheremetyevo Airport before being granted permission to leave by the Russian government. He had arrived there from Hong Kong, which he fled after U.S. authorities unsealed espionage charges in late June. He had initially planned to travel to Ecuador where he had been offered asylum, but remained marooned in Moscow after the U.S. voided his passport. Mr. Snowden applied for asylum in more than 20 countries after becoming stuck in Russia, but eventually decided to remain where he was as it became impossible for him to travel anywhere else. Mr. Kucherena said Thursday that his client was unable to continue applying for asylum in other countries under the terms of his asylum in Russia, which he had the option of extending at the end of the one-year period. The idea that Mr. Snowden may remain in Russia suggests the Russian government is committed to protecting him from the American justice system despite the fact that granting him asylum caused a considerable spike in tension between the two countries and led U.S. President Barack Obama
to cancel a summit meeting with President Putin in September. Mr. Putin had initially said that Mr. Snowden's arrival in Moscow had come as a "complete surprise" to the Russian government, but later said the fugitive had contacted Russian diplomats in Hong Kong days before his departure to ask for help. Mr. Putin said he only agreed to allow Mr. Snowden to remain in Russia after he arrived on the condition that he cease leaking information damaging to the U.S. —Olga Razumovskaya contributed to this article.

City Reaches Deal to Avert Parks Layoffs
August 19, 2011

"As the mayor has said repeatedly from the beginning of the budget process, if a union is willing to sit down and work with us to create savings, we can avoid some layoffs," said Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, in a statement. District Council 37, which represents the parks workers, agreed to allow full-time...

dropped 8.3%. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 0.6% at 2211.59, the lowest level since Dec. 25 last year when it closed at 2213.61, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down 0.04% to 21718.05. Some analysts though, advised taking a longer-term view of the situation. "We think the decline is a knee-jerk reaction and the market may overreact a bit over the (outbreak) of the bird flu," said Capital Securities analyst Amy Lin, who added that it remained too early to assess the full impact of the new avian flu strain. "Information disclosure is much better than that of (the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) 10 years ago," Ms. Lin said. In foreign exchange markets, the yen extended its losses against the U.S. dollar and the euro. The dollar was recently at ¥98.85 from ¥97.56 late Friday in New York, while the euro was recently at ¥128.53 from ¥126.77. "There has been no fresh news out that has driven the move higher in the dollar-yen but the move in the aftermath of the payrolls release has been very strong. The market remains committed to buying dips in the pair and the Y100 level is now within reach," Westpac

Biography
Updated June 28, 2013 4:08 p.m. ET
'It used to be that Americans did the drive-by vacation,' said Anne Morgan Scully, president of an upscale travel agency. 'They're not doing that anymore.'
Photo Illustration by F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal; Lonely Planet Images/Getty Images (Patagonia) TO DESCRIBE SCOTT Cooke's lifestyle as intense would not be off-base. A principal at New York-based luxury marketing and public-relations firm GCK Partners, he is constantly on call for his clients—and call they do, day and night. Mr. Cooke attends two events most evenings, and travels for business every three weeks or so. He goes to the gym daily. Oh—and twice a year, he takes vacations that are longer than some summer-camp sessions. The two-martini lunch may be extinct, but another perk common to yesteryear's workplace, the two-week vacation, is making a comeback among workaholic Americans. Off Duty editor Sara Clemence joins Lunch Break. Photo: AP.
Mr. Cooke, who just returned from a 12-day trip to a villa in Mallorca, Spain, will spend two weeks in Japan around Christmas, with New Year's in Kyoto. "I think it's good for your soul," he said of extended vacations. "It makes you more creative. It makes you a better boss…a better worker." The two-martini lunch may be extinct, but another perk common to yesteryear's workplace, the two-week vacation, is making a comeback. No longer limited to students, honeymooners and retirees, drawn-out holidays are finding converts in overachieving professionals. "It used to be that Americans did the drive-by vacation," breezing through major tourist attractions, said Anne Morgan Scully,
president of McCabe World Travel, an upscale travel agency in McLean, Va. "They're not doing that anymore." Her company has seen a 25% to 30% increase in longer holiday bookings over the last year, she said. Plenty of Americans have a hard time taking vacation at all. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about a quarter of private-industry workers didn't get any paid time off in 2012. And some who have holiday packages are loath to max them out, for fear of seeming dispensable in a still-shaky economy. But travel agents, hoteliers and travelers say they are seeing a trend toward longer, slower, farther trips: treks through Peru, voluntourism excursions in Africa, cruises around the Greek islands. Long bookings have recently shot up at the St. Regis Punta Mita Resort in Mexico, said Paul James,
global brand leader for St. Regis, the Luxury Collection and W Hotels Worldwide. "For this last December-January period, three-week stays were up 35% over the year before," he said. "The year before was double-digit over the year before that." “
Would you rather go from a conference call to a commute—or to a Mai Tai? ”
The long-trip trend is partly an outgrowth of our workaholic, multitasking culture. Because Americans work so much, and so intensely, it takes longer to unwind. But paradoxically, technology allows people to escape for longer, because they can tend to the demands of the office without clients knowing they're not actually in the office. Thanks to mobile devices, it's no longer necessary to camp out in an Internet cafe. "I'm always connected," said Mr. Cooke, who added that he rarely sets up his out-of-office notification. If work sounds like a dreadful intrusion on your beach escape, consider this: Would you rather go straight from a conference call to your commute—or to a Mai Tai? "Office hours have gone away," Mr. James said. "It's all life hours now." With longer vacations, a smaller percentage of time off is spent in transit or recovering from jet-lag. Extending your vacation is also a way to amortize higher transportation costs. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for instance, the average flight out of the U.S. cost about 24% more in 2012 than it did in 2009. There are more pleasant factors at play, too—like the rise in multigenerational trips. It's hard to do a whirlwind tour with a toddler and a grandparent in tow. "The word 'pace' is very relevant," Ms. Scully said. Christina Wayne is president of Cineflix Studios, an international television studio that offers generous vacation benefits. The company's approach, she said, makes employees feel respected—and is especially rewarding for hardworking parents. "For Europe I wouldn't want to go shorter than two weeks," said Ms. Wayne, who lives in New York with her husband and their 3½-year-old daughter. "We went to Sweden to visit family—Stockholm for five days, Falsterbo in southern Sweden for five days. Then the weather was terrible, so we went to Copenhagen for four days." Travelers are also seeking deeper, richer experiences, which often require a good amount of time. A two-day croissant workshop with a Parisian pastry chef is a bigger commitment than a pit stop at the Eiffel Tower. With guests bedding down for longer, hotels are creating special programs and amenities. "In Shanghai and Beijing, we see families spending longer periods of time and putting their kids through intensive local Mandarin schools," said Robert Cheng,
vice president of marketing for the Peninsula Hotels. The chain has been creating kid-friendly menus; its Peninsula Academy program offers activities like origami lessons in Tokyo and Thai cooking in Bangkok. A three-week stint at a five-star hotel may be beyond most budgets, but home-rental sites like HomeAway and Airbnb help make extended stays more accessible. Ms. Wayne, the television executive, often has to spend time in Los Angeles for work. "This past January, instead of booking a hotel, I rented a house and my family came out too," she said. It isn't all BlackBerrys in paradise—absenting yourself for a significant amount of time takes planning and gumption. Annie Guill,
operations manager for LittleCollector, an online retailer of art for kids, takes two-week vacations with her husband, who works in wines and spirits. This summer, they will jet off to a tiny Greek island, stopping in Paris on the way home. The couple makes sure they always can be reached by phone. "I really try to break down ahead of time what's going to be needed, so it doesn't fall on anyone else's shoulders," Ms. Guill said. "I notify everyone that I'm going to be gone, even vendors." The payoff for all that pretrip prep: coming back feeling recharged instead of shortchanged. Of his most recent trip, Mr. Cooke said, "On Friday I was like, 'I'm OK to go home on Saturday.' That's much better than thinking, 'Ugh, I don't want to go back to work.' " YOU'LL GO FAR // Seven Trips for More Than Seven Days Oceanfront Escape in Australia Enlarge Image

Southern Ocean Lodge When to Go: Year round Who to Bring: The whole family Workaholic Appeal: Medium-High It's a long way to the Antipodes, so make the most of it. Soak up culture while easily staying connected in Sydney, spend a few days driving the aptly named Great Ocean Road along the southern coast, then fly or ferry to Kangaroo Island, near Adelaide. "It's the Galapagos of Australia," said Michael Holtz, owner of New York-based travel agency SmartFlyer. He recommends the Southern Ocean Lodge, a glass-heavy resort that overlooks the sea and is open to children 6 and older. You can visit sea-lion-packed beaches and hike on the cliffs, then check work email while enjoying the dramatic view. southernoceanlodge.com.au Remote Rambles in Chile Enlarge Image
The Hotel Refugia in Chiloé

Hotel Refugia Chiloé When to Go: October through March Who to Bring: Outdoorsy pals Workaholic Appeal: Low-Medium Chile's bounty is so spread out over its roughly 2,700-mile length, it can take whole days to reach rewarding destinations, including the barren but beautiful Atacama Desert in the north and dramatic Patagonia in the south. Visiting the lush island of Chiloé, with its fishing villages, stilt houses and wooden churches, can feel like traveling back in time. The 12-room Hotel Refugia, which opened last year, is the first truly fancy offering in the region. While it does have Wi-Fi, you'd probably rather trek rain forests, visit penguin colonies and sail nearby fiords than answer email. It reopens for the season in September. refugia.cl Surf and Safari in South Africa Enlarge Image

Robert Harding World Imagery/Getty Images When to Go: November to March Who to Bring: School-age kids Workaholic Appeal: Low-Medium It can easily take more than a full day to travel from the U.S. to South Africa, but that's not the only reason to plan an extended visit: You can indulge in culinary and cultural experiences, take beach breaks between work check-ins, then set off on a family-friendly safari. Start out in Cape Town, to climb iconic Table Mountain, cruise the coast and tour South African wine country. Then shut down your laptop and travel to the northeast, where Phinda Private Game Reserve covers about 57,000 acres. Luxury safari outfitter &Beyond has six lodges, each with a different feel; all but one welcomes children. Phinda encompasses grassland, mountains and sand forest, and is home not only to the standard Big Five animals, but cheetahs and endangered black rhinos. andbeyondafrica.com The Luxury Circuit in Bhutan Enlarge Image
The Amankora Punakha in central Bhutan
Aman Resorts When to Go: Spring and fall Who to Bring: Spiritual spa-lovers Workaholic Appeal: Low Talk about remote: You can only reach this Himalayan kingdom via one airline. For many years only basic accommodations were available in Bhutan, but the uber-luxurious Amankora resort now has five lodges in different valleys, allowing guests to hike through the mountains, visit ancient Buddhist temples, fish in pristine rivers and indulge in a deep-tissue massage or three along the way. amanresorts.com The Slow Boat Through Northern Europe Enlarge Image
The Azamara Journey docked in Europe.
Azamara Club Cruises When to Go: June and July Who to Bring: Adults only Workaholic Appeal: Low Cruises have a reputation for making port stops so brief they barely allow for a dash to the souvenir stand, but many ships are docking for longer. Azamara Club Cruises is one of the trend leaders, said Anne Morgan Scully, president of McCabe World Travel. The company is offering a 12-night journey around the Baltic Sea next summer. The Azamara Journey waits until late in the evening to leave several ports—including Gdánsk, Poland and Wismar, Germany—and spends two full nights in St. Petersburg. While Internet service is available, it's pricey and can be spotty. azamaraclubcruises.com Urban Education in Shanghai Enlarge Image
The swimming pool at the Peninsula Shanghai.
The Peninsula Shanghai When to Go: Spring and fall Who to Bring: Your business partner—and your family Workaholic Appeal: High Today's take on the Grand Tour is more likely to involve the Great Wall of China than anything you'd find in a Henry James novel. In-the-know parents are exposing their children to Chinese culture, planning dedicated vacations or taking them on business trips. The Art Deco Peninsula Shanghai, situated on the Bund, may seem like a playground for soignée adults, but it welcomes kids with activities like kite-making lessons and cooking classes—assuming they have energy to play after Mandarin school lets out. peninsula.com Mellow in Mexico Enlarge Image

St. Regis Punta Mita Resort
St. Regis Punta Mita When to Go: December and January Who to Bring: The all-ages crowd Workaholic Appeal: High Think two weeks is too much for a beach vacation? There's enough on Mexico's Pacific coast to keep everyone occupied while you get through a juicy book—er, conference call. The rustic-elegant St. Regis Punta Mita Resort offers scuba, Spanish and dance instruction, and is a short boat ride from the Marietas Islands, where you can see whales, dolphins and blue-footed boobies. Work won't be a problem with high-speed Wi-Fi—and the kids club, open daily. The nearby Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita also has two Jack Nicklaus-designed golf courses and a yacht guests can rent. starwoodhotels.com, fourseasons.com Explore More

Head coach John Calipari of the Kentucky Wildcats
Getty Images The prevailing wisdom before this men's college basketball season was that Kentucky men's basketball coach John Calipari had figured out a way to beat the game. The Wildcats went 38-2 last season and won the national title, only to reload with another class of freakishly precocious freshmen to whom Lexington is merely a pit stop before packing off to the NBA. Then the season started. More than halfway through this year's college basketball campaign, those of us who predicted back-to-back titles for the Wildcats don't have egg on our faces so much as Western omelets with a side of hash browns and bacon. After losing to Alabama Tuesday, Kentucky fell to 12-6 and its NCAA tournament bid is in jeopardy. Calipari's squad doesn't have a win against a team ranked in the top 50 of the Rating Percentage Index, a metric used in NCAA tournament selection. Against top-100 RPI teams, the Wildcats are 1-6, with their one win coming in the first game of the season. Enlarge Image
The rest of Kentucky's schedule brings both good and bad news. The good news is that the Southeastern Conference is only the seventh-best league in the country this year, according to kenpom.com, a basketball statistics website. That means there are plenty of winnable games left. The bad news: Just six of Kentucky's last 13 games are against RPI top-100 teams—and the Wildcats may have to win most of them just to be in the bracket. Not that this particular pack of Wildcats remembers what that's like: None of the players in Kentucky's starting lineup played on last season's championship team. —Ben Cohen

Putin Cool on Snowden Asylum Bid
Putin Says NSA Leaker Must First Stop 'Harming' the U.S.
By
Gregory L. White and Alexander Kolyandr Updated July 1, 2013 4:19 p.m. ET
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency staffer who has sought political asylum in Russia amid espionage allegations, is welcome in the country only if he stops his disclosure of alleged abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies. But Mr. Putin reiterated that Moscow won't accede to U.S. requests to hand over Mr. Snowden, who faces charges of espionage for revealing details of...
