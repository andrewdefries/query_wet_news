U.S. Stock Futures Flat Ahead of Bernanke, Durables

By Barbara Kollmeyer MADRID -- U.S. stock futures were flat ahead of a second day of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a potential drop in durable-goods orders. Cheer derived from prior-day comments by the Fed chief and upbeat data drove gains for Wall Street, but continued unease over Italy dragged on sentiment. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4 points to 13863, while those for the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.3 points to 1494. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 index rose 0.5 point to 2,708.25. First up for markets, Durable-goods orders will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST, with economists surveyed by MarketWatch forecasting orders dropped 5% last month after a 4.3% rise in December. Lower bookings for commercial jets are likely behind that expected drop, though investors may want to focus on the more positive longer-term trend. But the star of the day is likely to be Bernanke, who will appear before the Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. EST for the second day of the Fed's semiannual report to Congress on the economy and monetary policy. On Tuesday, Bernanke provided a bit of a bounce for Wall Street after sending a firm signal that he's full behind a continuation of the central bank's $85 billion bond-buying program. "In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases...are clear," he said. Also Wednesday, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher, who isn't a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, will speak about the economic and monetary-policy outlook at 4:30 p.m. Eastern at Columbia University in New York City. Also, just two days remain until March 1, when automatic spending cuts will kick in unless politicians can reach a compromise. "A last minute solution is a possibility, as with the fiscal cliff two months ago, but it is unlikely to be a smooth ride," said Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, in emailed comments. Along with Bernanke, markets were also helped Tuesday by solid housing data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average racked up its second triple-digit gain in three sessions, closing up 115.96 points, or 0.8%, to 13900.13. In the prior session, the index lost 216.40 points amid worries about another crisis building in Europe after an inconclusive election result in Italy. Italy continued to haunt markets Wednesday, as Europe limped along despite those Wall Street gains. The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.1%, while Italian stocks were trading flat after a nearly 5% rout the prior day. Asia stocks mostly rose, benefiting from Bernanke's comments and U.S. economic data. But Japan's Nikkei Stock Average dropped 1.3% as the dollar continued to rise against the yen. Within other markets, gold prices fell $8 to $1,607.40, while oil rose. Within corporate news, Priceline.com shares will be in focus Wednesday. Late Tuesday, the travel-reservation-service provider reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings above analysts' expectations. First Solar Inc. shares will be shadowed on Wednesday. After hours Tuesday, the solar-energy-farm developer estimated first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates. And J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. shares will be watched closely. Media reports late Tuesday quoted Chief Executive Jamie Dimon as telling analysts that the bank will be cutting $1 billion of costs in 2013 and eliminating as many as 19,000 jobs by the end of 2014.

LeapFrog Shares Drop on Tempered 2013 Sales Outlook

   By John Kell 
 LeapFrog Enterprises Inc.'s (LF) shares fell Monday after the interactive toy maker issued a more cautious revenue outlook for 2013, citing fewer days between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays and a weak retail environment. The toy maker's stock slid 10% to $7.80 in after-hours trading. LeapFrog now expects annual sales of $570 million to $590 million, implying growth of up to 2% or down 2% from last year's level. Previously, LeapFrog had expected full-year sales to rise in the high single-digit range. Chief Financial Officer Ray Arthur said though net sales have risen 9% so far in 2013, the company is concerned about the fourth quarter, "given economic headwinds and a weak retail environment." Mr. Arthur also said the holiday season will be more challenging as there will be six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, including two fewer weekend shopping days, than a year ago. LeapFrog targets growing consumer interest in electronic play with the company's children's tablet, called the LeapPad, and Leapster-branded videogame system. The devices, which target younger children generally between 3 and 9 years old, have sold well the past two holiday seasons. And while LeapFrog has unveiled new devices with feature upgrades, the company is facing a more competitive landscape in 2013. Overall, LeapFrog reported a third-quarter profit of $26.4 million, or 37 cents a share, down from $41.7 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding tax-related items, adjusted profit grew to 38 cents from 32 cents. Net sales grew 4.1% to $201 million, as the top line grew 1% in the U.S. but jumped 14% internationally. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a per-share profit of 32 cents on $207 million in revenue. Gross margin fell to 39.5% from 40%.

Once the gateway to the Gulf for foreign businesses, debt-laden Dubai is now a roadblock to the region's chances of attracting investment dollars. Journal Report See the complete Gulf-U.A.E. report . WSJ.com/Mideast: News, video, graphics For this to change, the emirate needs to clear the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the restructuring of $22 billion of debts owed by government-backed Dubai World, according to fund managers. Dubai World's decision in November to seek a standstill on debt repayment meant it was effectively defaulting on its obligations, refusing to pay creditors interest payments or to redeem loans. The debt will need to be restructured if creditors want to get their money back. The process has so far given foreign investors scant reason for optimism. Paul Crean, chief investment officer at Finisterre Capital, an emerging-markets hedge fund, says: "Investors feel quite bruised by the restructuring process. All the guidance given to the market at the end of last year, including by Sheik Mohammed [the ruler of Dubai], suggested that all Dubai World obligations would be paid promptly." As this report went to press, Dubai was expected to present a deal within days in which creditors would be asked to accept a 40% "haircut" on their bonds, owed mainly by Dubai World's real-estate subsidiaries Nakheel and Limitless. Investors had assumed that because Dubai World is a government-owned vehicle its debts were implicitly the same as the sovereign. They were given comfort by credit-ratings agencies, such as Moody's, which in a 2008 report said it expected "a high level of support" from the Dubai government for its subsidiaries' debts.

Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Investors that were caught out have only themselves to blame, according to Daniel Broby, chief investment officer of Silk Invest, an asset-management boutique. "A lot of people fell into the trap of believing the rating agencies that government-owned borrowers enjoyed the implicit support of the government," he says. "But there wasn't even a bankruptcy law covering Dubai World debt. That should have come out in any due diligence." Investors are getting restless. A member of the bank creditor committee says: "The standstill agreement initially put forward by the government envisioned the government lending to Dubai World on a preferred basis. The creditors couldn't agree to that, so there is no formal standstill agreement in place. Everyone is waiting to see what the restructuring plan looks like." U.K. banks are particularly exposed. Royal Bank of Scotland, in which the U.K. government is the main shareholder, is believed to be owed between $1 billion and $2 billion, with other British banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, owed about $3 billion in total. Lord Mandelson, the U.K.'s business minister, told a conference in February: "Time is running out [for Dubai World]. The current uncertainty and the lack of agreement can not go on for much longer." Local U.A.E. banks, which own 45% of Dubai World's debt, are also pressuring Dubai for a quick resolution. Debashis Dey, partner in the Dubai office of Clifford Chance, which is working on the restructuring, says: "Local banks are struggling with so many restructurings: not just Dubai World, but Global Investment House in Kuwait, and the Saad restructurings in Saudi Arabia. It has become a real strain for them. So they need the situation to be resolved in the near-term." Mr. Dey defends the restructuring process. "Compared to other restructurings in the Middle East, the U.A.E. is moving at a lightning pace," he contends. "Other major restructurings in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait are taking over a year. And they have been much less transparent, and have treated foreign and local investors differently. "There is very little precedent in the region for doing a major restructuring according to international standards. One of the positives that could come from this whole process is that the U.A.E. could establish a template of how these things are done, which other countries can follow." But creditors are determined to drive a hard bargain. A member of the negotiating committee says that the creditors are "prepared to accept an extension of maturity, but not a haircut or a lower interest rate. That might require the government injecting, say, another $10 billion into Dubai World. But the government has to ask: if it forced a haircut on investors, how much would it cost the U.A.E. in terms of contagion and lack of liquidity?" A restructuring of the debt should at least mark the nadir of the crisis, says Emad Mostaque, an investment manager at Pictet Asset Management. "The Dubai World restructuring is really the last hurdle," he says. "From there on, you're at the bottom of the market, and you should see it beginning to rise." The Dubai authorities will be desperately hoping his assessment is right. With the Dubai Financial Market equity index down 70% from its 2008 peak and the cost of insuring Dubai's sovereign debt having ballooned to 600 basis points in the credit default swap market, the emirate's reputation as the Gulf's boom town lies in tatters. "No foreign investor will touch Dubai at the moment," says Mohammed Hanif, chief executive of Insparo Asset Management, an emerging-markets hedge fund. Just as Dubai acted as the magnet to draw foreign capital to the region during the boom years, its dramatic fall from grace has had implications for its neighbors. "The Middle East was always an off-index bet," says Mr. Crean of Finisterre Capital. "Recent complications in Dubai have made a lot of investors think 'why bother?'" Other investors are not quite so pessimistic. They believe that the release of the Dubai World restructuring plan will mark a bottoming out for the market, not just in the wider region but in Dubai itself as well. "The Dubai story still has positives," Mr. Mostaque says. "It still has mature infrastructure here, it's still a trade and services hub." Husam Hourani, managing partner of law firm Al Tamimi, agrees: "Almost all investors realize Dubai is still the regional center. Other cities are trying to establish themselves, like Doha and Riyadh. But Dubai is much further ahead, in terms of transport facilities, hotels, shopping, and the general levels of openness. And foreign banks might be pulling back their exposure, but none of them are leaving." y —Mr. Evans is a writer based in London. He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.

Investors are flocking to Spanish and Italian government debt, reversing a shift that pushed yields sharply higher over the summer. The bonds of both countries, considered key barometers of stress in the euro zone, have rallied since Greece's creditors struck a deal to reduce the country's debt burden this week, removing a worry that had plagued investors for months. Underscoring investors' renewed enthusiasm, Italy on Thursday auctioned five- and 10-year bonds at the lowest yield in two years. Spanish bond yields sunk to their lowest level since March in response to the Greek debt deal and due to the continuing effect of the European Central Bank's July pledge that it would step in to hold down borrowing costs. Bond yields move in the opposite direction to prices. Investors also are taking advantage of renewed stability in debt markets to buy bonds that offer higher returns than ultrasafe German debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Italian bond remains three percentage points above its German equivalent and similarly dated Spanish bonds yield nearly four percentage points more than German paper. "If market conditions stay where they are, Spanish and Italian bonds offer an attractive return," said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen,
head of tactical asset allocation at ING Investment Management. The company manages around €20 billion ($26 billion) across a number of asset classes. Since July, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro, Mr. Nieuwenhuijzen has held more Spanish and Italian debt in his portfolio than is represented in major bond indexes. The ECB has promised to buy the debt of fiscally troubled countries, driving down their borrowing costs, once those nations are in international bailout programs. Enlarge Image

Investment Management. "It will be a long process but we are still confident in the ability of European policy makers to step in in times of trouble." The resurgent appetite from foreign investors adds to the support from Spanish and Italian banks that have continued to mop up vast amounts of sovereign debt. Underscoring the revival, Italy on Thursday issued a bond maturing in 2017 at a yield of 3.23%, the lowest funding cost for five-year paper since October 2010, while the 2022-dated bond had a yield of 4.45%, the lowest 10-year yield at a tender since November 2010. "This is particularly significant given that both bonds fall outside the maximum three-year maturity" of debt covered by the ECB's bond-buying plan, said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.
Other countries are also benefiting: Belgium's 10-year yield fell to a euro-era low Thursday, while French yields also fell to within a whisker of a record low. During the summer, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds as high as 7.67%, while the yield on Italian 10-year paper rose to 6.67% amid concerns about the abilities of the governments to service their debt. Still, despite the recent surge in demand, many investors expect challenges to resurface next year that could put the recent rally into reverse. Mr. Van Nieuwenhuijzen said he expects Spanish yields to rise at some point in early 2013, possibly forcing Spain to ask for a bailout from the European Union—a move it has so far resisted. Scott Thiel,
head of European and global bonds at BlackRock, believes the wheels are already in motion, and that a bailout request will likely emerge "not too far into the future." If Spain does ask for a bailout, it would allow the ECB to begin buying Spanish debt in the secondary market, driving down yields. "This isn't a trivial process for the Spanish government. They need to do it on their own terms" and get acceptance for the conditions that would be attached to the aid, said Mr. Thiel, who manages around $100 billion in fixed-income assets. Patience could start to wear thin if the process drags on too far into next year, he said. With its economy in recession and regional finances in a parlous state, the Spanish government's budget deficit is ballooning. Without ECB support, Spain could find it tough to sell the bonds it needs to plug the gap. UBS

forecasts bond sales by Spain will soar to a record €123.5 billion in 2013, up from a projected €105 billion this year. If Spain issues debt at that pace, it could drive Spanish yields up to the high points reached in July, with the possibility of Spain losing market access completely, UBS interest-rate strategists said in a researchnote. One key trigger of the recent rally—the Greek bailout deal—also continues to raise questions. A major element of the package, a bond buyback program, means Greece must convince its bondholders to let it buy back the debt at a steep discount to face value. It isn't yet certain Greece will get enough bondholders to participate. If it doesn't, that would leave the package in tatters, potentially triggering a new surge in European bond yields. —Emese Bartha contributed to this article.
