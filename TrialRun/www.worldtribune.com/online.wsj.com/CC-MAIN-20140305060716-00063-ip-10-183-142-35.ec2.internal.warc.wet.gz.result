The setting may be European, but the U.S. and China will be central to many of the discussions when global business and political leaders meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which opens Wednesday. The global financial crisis and the stumbling efforts to tackle climate change have highlighted the mounting evidence that China is becoming the world's second-most influential country after the U.S. Enlarge Image
Swiss President Doris Leuthard welcomes Li Keqiang on Tuesday.
Reuters A growing number of policy makers, economists and political analysts argue that the U.S.-China bilateral relationship is now the most important of all—and that the chances of managing the globalized world successfully will be slim unless these two powers, as different as yin and yang, can cooperate. But although the U.S. and China may be the two most powerful countries for years to come, many analysts and officials doubt they can, or should, form a de-facto Group of Two to set the global agenda. Differences of interest, affluence, political ideology, and diplomatic approach are among the obstacles. History suggests a partnership between an established power and a rising one is a stretch. From ancient Sparta and Athens to Britain and Germany a century ago, hegemons and upstarts have tended to collide, rather than cooperate. Despite the challenges, Fred Bergsten,
director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, argues that a G-2 partnership should manage the global economy, acting as an informal "steering committee" to facilitate broader deals within multilateral institutions, including the Group of 20 and the World Trade Organization. "Unless the G-2 agrees, it's very hard to achieve progress within these global institutions," Mr. Bergsten says. The U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen last month bore that out: Achieving a deal required a last-minute summit between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. Mr. Wen rejected the idea of a G-2 partnership during Mr. Obama's visit to Beijing in November. "Global issues should be decided by all nations in the world, rather than one or two countries," Mr. Wen said. China has a long way to go before it is modernized and "we must always keep sober-minded over it," he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. The idea of a G-2 partnership is controversial, because it suggests a two-nation hegemony over a world that is more politically fragmented than during the bipolar Cold War era. "All the major Asian and European powers would not wish to cede management of world affairs to Washington and Beijing, and developing countries would oppose it too," says David Shambaugh,
a China specialist at George Washington University who is currently a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Despite its growing heft, China still prefers to act as part of a group of other developing countries, to avoid standing in the limelight and attracting pressure and criticism. Characteristically, Mr. Wen invited the leaders of India, Brazil and South Africa to the crucial meeting with Mr. Obama in Copenhagen. Beijing fears a global leadership role would force it to take on responsibilities that it isn't ready for, such as doing more to cut carbon emissions, say analysts. China prefers to style itself as a poor country largely focused on its own affairs—a low-key approach in keeping with late leader Deng Xiaoping's instruction to "hide one's capacities and bide one's time." The Chinese leadership even disputes the idea that China is a global economic power. It is a losing argument. Beijing's economic might has become far too great to hide. China is widely tipped to overtake Japan as the world's second biggest economy this year. The country's gross domestic product is set to overtake the U.S.'s in 17 years, according to Goldman Sachs' chief economist Jim O'Neill.
The U.S. and China are already the world's biggest trading nations. China has the world's second-biggest defense budget, although analysts say it will be many decades before it can match U.S. military capabilities. Achieving parallel adjustments in both economies could be the key to rebalancing the global economy, many officials and analysts in Davos are likely to argue. China will have to take more responsibility for the global order before long, Mr. Bergsten argues. "When you become an economic superpower, your actions have such an impact on the global system that it feeds back into your own interests, so you have to take that into account," he says. For example, China's insistence on keeping its currency pegged to the dollar at a rate lower than market forces would dictate risks sparking a protectionist backlash in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, which would harm China's export-dependent economy. China's interests should make it a guardian of an open world trade regime, Mr. Bergsten says. Write to Marcus Walker at marcus.walker@wsj.com and Andrew Batson at andrew.batson@wsj.com Email

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court entered the debate over gay marriage, saying it would hear cases challenging a federal law and a California law that limit the rights of same-sex couples. The move Friday means that a defining legal moment is set to come by next June, after a year in which gay marriage assumed even greater prominence in the national debate and social acceptance widened. President Barack Obama
in May said he personally believed gay couples should have the right to wed, becoming the first sitting president to take that stand. Enlarge Image

Getty Images See Related Video on #WorldStream WSJ's Jess Bravin on Supreme Court's Decision to Hear Two Gay Marriange Cases In November, Maine, Maryland and Washington state became the first states to approve gay marriage at the ballot box, joining six other states and the District of Columbia that had authorized the unions through legislative acts and judicial rulings. The decision to take both cases—including one involving California's voter-approved ban on gay marriage—suggests the justices are ready to tackle the issue fully. The first case before the high court concerns the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 federal law denying benefits to same-sex spouses. Two federal appeals courts have found it unconstitutional, ruling that no legitimate purpose justifies penalizing lawfully married people because they are gay. Shifting Ground Gay marriage has fared better of late with courts and voters. September 1996: President Bill Clinton signs the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed by bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate. It forbids federal recognition for samesex marriages. November 2008: California voters narrowly pass Proposition 8, barring same-sex marriage in the state. February 2012: Federal appeals court in San Francisco strikes down Proposition 8 in 2-1 vote. May 2012: President Barack Obama says he personally favors gay couples having the right to marry. Oct. 18, 2012: Federal appeals court in New York strikes down the DOMA in 2-1 vote. Nov. 6, 2012: Voters in three states—Maryland, Maine and Washington state—approve gay marriage. Minnesota voters reject an attempt to ban gay marriage. Dec. 7, 2012: U.S. Supreme Court says it will accept both the DOMA and Prop 8 cases.
Of the four cases presented to it involving the 1996 law, the Supreme Court selected just one to be argued, that of Edith Windsor of New York. Her spouse, Thea Clara Spyer,
died in 2009 after more than four decades together, and she was assessed with a $363,000 estate tax bill she wouldn't have received had she married a man. The second case concerns California's Proposition 8, a 2008 voter initiative that amended the state constitution to limit marriage to the union of a man and a woman. The initiative came on the heels of a state supreme court decision finding that the California Constitution's equal-protection provisions allowed no distinction in marriage privileges between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The San Francisco-based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found Proposition 8 unconstitutional because it withdrew rights from a minority group. Some 18,000 same-sex couples married in California in 2008 before Proposition 8 was passed. Adding to the drama, both the Obama administration and the state of California agree with plaintiffs that the antigay marriage laws are unconstitutional and have declined to defend them in court. Advocates of the laws have stepped in to defend them, but the Supreme Court indicated that their standing to do so could be in doubt. In the Defense of Marriage Act case, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has stepped in to defend the statute, hiring Paul Clement, a former solicitor general in the George W. Bush
administration, as its lawyer. "When Thea and I met nearly 50 years ago, we never could have dreamed that the story of our life together would be before the Supreme Court as an example of why gay married couples should be treated equally," said Ms. Windsor. Enlarge Image

EPA More Law Blog: Will 'Standing' Stand in the Supreme Court's Way? Law Blog: California, Here we Come Law Blog: Why These Same-Sex Marriage Cases? Changing Perspectives on Gay Marriage Opponents of gay marriage said the Supreme Court's decision would be a chance to put the brakes on lower courts. Andy Pugno of ProtectMarriage.com, the group that put Proposition 8 on the ballot and is defending it in court, said the Supreme Court shouldn't be swayed by public opinion. "We are glad to finally have an opportunity to have a fair hearing after having been through the lower courts where clearly the deck was stacked against us," he said. While the cases involve same-sex marriage, they don't directly raise the question of whether the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal protection, due process and individual liberty mean that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. Instead, the gay marriage issue is arriving at the high court in increments. The Defense of Marriage Act case tests the power of the federal government to reject a marriage authorized by states, which historically have held sway over family law.

The Proposition 8 case in California also doesn't necessarily force courts to decide on a fundamental gay-marriage right. A federal appeals court in San Francisco struck down the proposition on narrower grounds, saying the state couldn't withdraw a previously recognized right from a minority that has suffered discrimination. Previously Appeals Court Deals Blow to DOMA (10/18/12) Gay-Marriage Decision Sets Up Next Fight (5/31/12) Court Rejects State Ban on Gay Marriage (2/8/12) The Supreme Court's liberal wing—Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan—is likely to treat the Defense of Marriage Act with skepticism. Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia is expected to be more deferential to the law, probably joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito also typically takes conservative positions on social issues. A larger question mark hangs over Chief Justice John Roberts, who in cases such as the June decision on President Obama's health-care law has been sensitive to the court's long-term interests in maintaining credibility with the public and other branches of government. While 41 states either ban gay marriage or have no provisions to recognize it, public opinion trends suggest growing acceptance, particularly among younger Americans. If Chief Justice Roberts votes with the opponents of gay marriage, the deciding voice almost certainly will be that of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has been the court's most impassioned defender of gay rights. In 1996—the same year the Defense of Marriage Act was passed—an opinion by Justice Kennedy struck down Colorado's Amendment 2, a voter initiative that barred state and local government from protecting gays from discrimination. Seven years later, in Lawrence v. Texas, the court overruled its own 1986 precedent to strike down a state law criminalizing gay sex. Justice Kennedy said liberty presumes that people are entitled to autonomy in "certain intimate conduct." In dissent, Justice Scalia accused the majority of signing on to the "so-called homosexual agenda," and he said its reasoning would likely lead to recognition of same-sex marriage. —Geoffrey A.

BEIJING -- Already struggling with the global slowdown, one of China's best-known companies, real-estate developer Soho China Ltd., also has been hit hard by something less expected: political missteps. Beijing's skyline features buildings by Soho China, which has run into trouble over its development of a historic area in the city.
Imaginechina Soho's difficulties with a project in one of Beijing's oldest districts illustrates how even one of China's savviest Western-oriented companies can fall victim to the opacity of the country's real-estate market. Soho said it went into the project hoping to save the old district, known as Qianmen; instead, swaths of historic buildings have been leveled and Soho remains locked out of revenue. Headed by the husband-and-wife duo of Pan Shiyi
and Zhang Xin,
Soho rose to prominence by buying up old industrial plots and hiring Western architects to produce glitzy commercial property that it sold to newly wealthy Chinese. Along the way, the media-friendly couple earned attention and acclaim around the world, making them emblems of China's economic rise. Last year, Soho capped its successes with a public offering on the Hong Kong stock market that raised $1.65 billion. In Beijing's Central Business District, its buildings, topped by the company's logo, are seemingly ubiquitous. But Soho has been hit hard by the global downturn. Its stock is off nearly 70% from its 52-week high, as are other Chinese real-estate companies'. From an initial offering price of 8.30 Hong Kong dollars, and a peak of HK$10.20, it closed Tuesday at HK$3.30 (43 U.S. cents). In the first half of the year, the company reported a loss of $21 million, compared with a profit of $9.2 million for the same period last year. Zhang Xin
That mirrors problems at other Chinese real-estate developers, such as China Vanke Co., which said this month that revenue from real-estate sales in November fell 16% from a year earlier, as property prices remained weak. Consumers aren't buying apartments and companies are cutting expansion plans. Soho's problems, however, have been made worse by longer-term woes afflicting Chinese real estate. In China, local governments have few sources of money; the country has no property tax, while income taxes go to the central government. So local officials rely on real-estate deals, which usually involve pushing out residents in exchange for modest compensation and flipping the land to developers for a profit. Over the past decade, such deals have resulted in numerous high-level corruption cases, as well as protests, but none involving Soho. Until last year, Soho had avoided sensitive projects. Then it decided to take on the redevelopment of a labyrinth of alleys and lanes in Beijing's old quarters.The Qianmen district was one of the last functioning old-town neighborhoods in the city of 17 million people. Soho's plan was to rebuild the district into a pedestrian mall of faux-1920s shops. But the project quickly ran into trouble. It had the backing of the local district government, but contravened Beijing's historical preservation plans, which had called for Qianmen to be protected. When nongovernmental activists learned of the project, they protested. One group, the China Heritage Foundation, posted an eight-page critique of Soho's plans on the Internet, saying it threatened to wreck a valuable neighborhood. Soho was involved in the project indirectly through a company owned by Mr. Pan, the chairman, who invested in a company owned by the district government. The idea was that Mr. Pan would sell his share of the company to Soho, according to Soho's stock prospectus. What happened next is in dispute. According to preservationists, some of whom work for local governments, that transfer has been blocked permanently by the Beijing city government, which is investigating the project for violating preservation rules. "The city government was angry and blocked anything else happening there," said Wang Jun, an author on Beijing's conservation. Pan Shiyi
City and district government officials declined to comment. Soho's version is somewhat different. "That [conservation] alone is not the issue," Ms. Zhang, Soho's chief executive, said in an interview. Instead, she said the problem is primarily with a government austerity measure put in place early last year when the Chinese real-estate market was heating up. That made it harder for foreign-listed companies to invest in Chinese real estate. When that policy is lifted, she said, Soho will gain the assets. Soho hasn't lost money on the project because it hasn't paid for the assets. Overall, analysts said the company is sound, with $1.4 billion in cash. It recently bought back some shares, which has helped stabilize the stock price. But the project remains off Soho's books, crimping its prospects. Soho said that by the end of 2009, it will develop another 13.5 million square feet of gross floor area. With the Qianmen project, that amount would have increased 30%. One Hong Kong brokerage estimated earlier this year that with Qianmen, Soho's net asset value would be boosted 50%. Worse might be the potential damage to Ms. Zhang and Mr. Pan's image in the West. The couple won awards and notice for their buildings' architecture, but are now involved in a project that is destroying an old neighborhood and replacing it with a replica. "A lot of other people, me included, had a very different view of what conservation was," Ms. Zhang said. "Qianmen is a headache."
