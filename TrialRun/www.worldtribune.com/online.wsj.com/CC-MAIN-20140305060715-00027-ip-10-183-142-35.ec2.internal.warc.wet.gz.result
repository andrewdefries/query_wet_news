Summer Box Office Falters, Closing With a Record Dud
By
Erica Orden
Updated Sept. 3, 2012 7:51 p.m. ET
A sluggish summer for Hollywood came to a close with a movie that earned the dubious distinction of the worst opening of all time. "The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure," a family movie from a former marketer for the Teletubbies, earned $448,000 over the holiday weekend when it opened on 2,160 screens, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. That gave the film a per-screen average of $207, making it the worst wide opening to...

A Fighting General
An Iraq war veteran gets the top U.S. military job.
Updated June 1, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET
By law, Presidents nominate, and the Senate confirms, America's senior military officers. By experience, the best of those officers, from Ulysses Grant to Creighton Abrams, were forged and proven in war. Which makes it encouraging that President Obama has nominated General Martin Dempsey, a battle-tested veteran of Iraq, to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Obama's announcement, along with the nomination of former Iraq commander Ray Odierno to take Gen. Dempsey's place as Army Chief of Staff, fills...

Yukari Iwatani Kane And Sam Schechner Updated Feb. 11, 2010 6:13 p.m. ET
Apple Inc. is in discussions with television networks to lower the price of downloaded TV shows when the company begins selling its new iPad tablet computer, people familiar with the talks said. One of these people said Apple has already been testing a price of 99 cents—half the price of standard-definition TV episodes—for certain shows on its iTunes service and wants to finalize a deal to offer that price more broadly along with the iPad, which is expected to go on sale in late March. A search on iTunes showed, for example, that episodes of MTV Networks' comedy show "Wonder Showzen," Viacom's "Celebrity Paranormal Project" and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.'s "Children's Hospital" drama series are currently on sale for 99 cents. Some episodes of selected television shows have also been available for free. The people familiar with the talks said the new pricing has not been finalized yet. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Apple could begin offering 99-cent pricing for TV shows along with the iPad. The discussions are part of Apple's broader strategy to overhaul its iTunes service. The Cupertino, Calif., company acquired music-streaming service La La Media Inc. late last year as part of a plan to offer consumers more ways to access and manage their music purchases. On the video side, it has been in serious discussions with television networks since last fall to come up with more compelling pricing packages for consumers. Apple currently offers TV shows for $1.99 for standard-definition episodes and $2.99 for high-definition episodes. For an entire season, consumers might pay $49.99 in high-definition for a popular television series. Several executives at media companies have acknowledged in recent months that Apple's prices for video on iTunes are extremely high, but it's also one of the reasons why media companies and cable operators have not felt threatened by the offerings. As The Wall Street Journal previously reported, Apple's initial discussions with the networks centered on a monthly subscription plan for a selection of TV shows. People familiar said those talks appear to have stalled, though one of those people said that Apple hasn't given up on that idea as an additional offering. Beefing up its content offerings is crucial for the success of the iPad, which Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs
has touted as the pre-eminent media and entertainment device. One person familiar with the talks said that Apple met with at least one network as recently as last week to discuss the pricing. This person said the company was trying to "ignite the video part of iTunes," which has been a small contributor to the service's revenues so far. In its quarter ended Dec. 26, Apple reported $1.16 billion in iTunes Store sales, iPod services and accessories.
