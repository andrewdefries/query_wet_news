Por KATHERINE BOEHRET
Puede que las computadoras tipo tableta y los teléfonos inteligentes hayan tomado control de la vida de la gente, pero Microsoft ha logrado mantener su dominio en la forma en que las personas usan sus computadoras personales con un producto: el confiable Office.La nueva versión del paquete de productividad, que está disponible desde el 29 de enero, es un cambio radical respecto a ediciones previas. Para empezar, Office 365 tiene un nuevo y sorprendente modelo de precios: está disponible a través de una suscripción que puede ser renovada de forma automática cada año. Este nuevo sistema actualiza constantemente funciones de los programas durante todo el año. Cada vez que se abre un programa de Office, se estará usando la versión más reciente.

Microsoft
Con el nuevo Office, una computadora puede ser desactivada de forma remota.
También está más estrechamente ligado a la nube, al grabar documentos en el sistema de almacenamiento SkyDrive de Microsoft de forma automática, de modo que sus archivos y configuraciones personales están disponibles de forma remota. Con esto, Microsoft apunta a frenar el avance de servicios rivales como Drive de Google, que ofrece a los usuarios una forma de crear y guardar documentos en línea, así como compartir y editar archivos con varios usuarios.Es más, Office 365 ofrece a la gente un punto centralizado en línea en el que pueden administrar su cuenta y ver las máquinas donde está instalado Office. Desde esta central, se puede desactivar computadoras que no están en uso o cancelar por completo una suscripción. Y los archivos seguirán estando disponibles para descargar, incluso si la suscripción se vence.
Además de estos rasgos generales, hay cambios significativos en los programas de Office 365, que incluye Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher y Access. Un aspecto positivo del paquete es que saca a la superficie funciones que antes estaban ocultas debajo de menús. También tiene muchos elementos nuevos, varios de las cuales fueron diseñados para pantallas táctiles y nuevas computadoras fabricadas para funcionar con el nuevo Windows 8. Microsoft también ha actualizado su Office Web Apps, que son versiones más sencillas de sus programas que permiten la edición de archivos guardados en línea por medio de un navegador.
Probé el Office 365 Home Premium (Hogar Premium en español), que cuesta US$99 al año y puede ser instalado en hasta cinco computadoras, incluyendo las que operan con Windows 7 y Windows 8, así como Mac con al menos la versión 10.5.8 del sistema OS X de Apple. La edición empresarial del paquete de productividad será lanzada el 27 de febrero y las suscripciones costarán entre US$4 y US$20 al mes.
Las versiones tradicionales sin suscripción de Office están disponibles a precios de compra que van desde US$140 para la versión estudiantil hasta US$400 para la versión profesional. Estos paquetes reciben parches de seguridad como siempre lo han hecho, pero pueden instalarse en sólo una computadora y las actualizaciones requieren la instalación de una versión nueva completa. Al igual que Office 365, estás versiones también guardan automáticamente los documentos en SkyDrive.
Instalé Office 365 Home Premium en dos computadoras: una Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T, que tiene una pantalla táctil y opera con Windows 8 Pro, y una MacBook Pro con la versión 10.8.2 de OS X. Además, instalé Office 365 en un teléfono con Windows para abrir y editar documentos desde el dispositivo portátil.

Microsoft
La suscripción en español para la versión Hogar Premium cuesta aproximadamente US$99.
Para instalarlo en la computadora con Windows 8, usé una clave de producto que recibí de Microsoft para hacer una prueba antes del lanzamiento. Los usuarios regulares tienen que ir a Office.com y comprar una suscripción. (Existe una versión con un período de prueba de 30 días sin cargo.) En la parte superior derecha se puede escoger "Latinoamérica – Español". Además de la versión regional, hay dos específicas para México y Argentina. A la hora de pagar, la página le da la opción de escoger el "país de facturación" para mostrarle el precio en su moneda local.
La instalación en la computadora con Windows 8 se demoró unos 20 minutos y una introducción útil me hizo un recorrido sobre los puntos clave de Office 365. Una pantalla me preguntó cómo quería que se viera mi Office y ofrecía opciones de patrones de fondo.
La descarga en la Mac se demoró unos 30 minutos. Como la hice usando mi cuenta de Microsoft, el diseño que me apareció fue el mismo que había escogido para la instalación anterior. La edición que me apareció fue Office: Mac 2011 debido a que la versión para las computadoras de Apple usualmente se lanza después de la de Windows.
La estructura basada en la nube de Office 365 requiere de ciertos ajustes, pero los usuarios igual pueden guardar documentos en los discos duros de sus computadoras. Cuando no estaba conectada a Internet y abría un documento en Word, recibí una notificación que me recordaba que la versión que estaba viendo no estaba en línea. Este aviso también me dijo cuándo el documento había sido actualizado y guardado por última vez en línea. Cada cuenta de Office 365 viene con 20 gigabytes de espacio de almacenamiento gratis, y todos los usuarios de SkyDrive reciben siete gigabytes cada uno, con lo que una persona podría tener 27 gigabytes gratis.
Disfruté con el uso de las funciones táctiles, como los cinco cuadrados en la parte derecha de la pantalla inicial en Outlook que hizo muy fácil navegar por mi bandeja de entrada. Estos pequeños íconos me permitieron responder, mover, borrar, marcar como no leído y resaltar mensajes con una bandera roja. Escribí esta columna en la nueva versión de Word, que fue almacenada automáticamente en SkyDrive. Luego la pude abrir y editar en otras computadoras y en un teléfono Windows.
Las hojas de cálculo de Excel son ahora más inteligentes que nunca gracias a funciones de "relleno rápido". Probé una que parecía que leía mi mente al completar los nombres de personas que habían aparecido en columnas previas. Las presentaciones de PowerPoint incluyen ahora herramientas especiales de notas, que sólo el presentador puede ver.
Office 365 se siente como una versión adulta y lista para el ritmo rápido de la web. El paquete está especialmente diseñado para personas que usan varias máquinas, incluyendo computadoras de escritorio, portátiles, tabletas y teléfonos inteligentes. Si los usuarios pueden comprender el nuevo sistema de suscripción, Microsoft tiene un paquete de productividad ganador en sus manos.

The New IOS 6 Maps and the Amazing Tumblr
I came across a video online, a parody about the new IOS 6 Maps called "iOS 6 Maps: an explanation from Apple (parody)."I went online to see if it is true that the IOS 6 Maps are having so much problems. There, the IOS 6 Maps and all the errors that the maps are having are all over the Internet.People from around the world kept uploading and posting their screenshots of the IOS 6 Map errors. Some of the images are showing the wrong mapped locations. Even the Apple store is either not showing on the map at all or somewhere else on the map.If you go online and search for "the amazing ios6 maps and tumblr.com," you will see the famous tumblr with all the images uploaded from around the world.There are many news and frustrated comments posted about how bad the IOS 6 Maps are and so forth.What is your opinion? Do you own an iPad or iPhone that has been upgrade to the new IOs 6? What is your experience with the new IOS 6 Maps?

Charles Levinson, Margaret Coker and Matt Bradley in Cairo and Adam Entous and Jonathan Weisman in Washington
Updated Feb. 12, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down after 18 days of unrelenting protests, handing power to the military and opening the door to an uncertain new course for the Arab world's most populous country, and for the entire Middle East. The announcement Friday afternoon sparked celebrations by protesters across the country that were echoed elsewhere in the region. Egyptians of all ages jammed the banks of the Nile and the squares of Cairo waving flags, lighting off fireworks and shouting "freedom." Now that Hosni Mubarak has stepped down as Egypt's President after three decades in that role, Jerry Seib, John Bussey and Brooking's Shadi Hamid look at what's next for Egypt? Plus, Charles Levinson has reaction from Cairo.
In Amman, Jordan, the central downtown circle became clogged with honking cars within minutes, while cheering celebrants marched to the Egyptian Embassy. In Beirut, festive gunfire broke out. Mr. Mubarak's resignation opens a period of uncertainty not only for Egypt, which will have to manage a period of military rule, but for countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and the U.S., for whom Mr. Mubarak has been a key anchor of their policies in the Middle East. Mr. Mubarak becomes the second long-standing Middle Eastern ruler to be pushed from office in as many months by determined popular protest, following Tunisia's President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Such a political earthquake hasn't hit the region since the 1979 Iranian revolution. In this photo taken from Egyptian television, Egypt's vice president Omar Suleiman announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down.
Associated Press The power shift in Cairo puts new pressure on the Obama administration, which was often left in the dark as the revolution played out and stumbled in its efforts to stage-manage Mr. Mubarak's exit. Now the challenge is to try to steer Egypt toward a secular democracy that best serves U.S. interests. Speaking at the White House Friday afternoon, Mr. Obama hailed the protest movement and offered whatever assistance would be needed to ensure that "nothing less than genuine democracy can carry the day." He was careful not to claim any credit for Mr. Mubarak's downfall. "Today belongs to the people of Egypt," he said. Through Journal Photographers' Lenses

More photos and interactive graphics Video: The Latest From Egypt Indeed, the effort to unravel Mr. Mubarak's 29-year rule began with a dozen activists who used Internet tools, including Facebook, to stir discontent with Egypt's police forces. They mobilized support in Egypt's slums and working-class neighborhoods and plotted a mass demonstration for Jan. 25, a holiday honoring the police. By then, the Obama administration was being pushed by some allies to toughen its stand against Mr. Mubarak, while others argued that the long-time ruler was the only force able to stave off a threat from an Islamist political movement, the Muslim Brotherhood. White House advisers wanted the administration to send an emissary to Cairo with the message that Mr. Mubarak should step aside. The administration chose Frank Wisner, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt with close ties to Mr. Mubarak and Arab leaders. The thinking was the message should be delivered by a friend. That proved wrong. Mr. Wisner delivered a tepid message to Mr. Mubarak about his future on Feb. 1, people familiar with the matter said. He further diluted the message a few days later when he publicly stated that Mr. Mubarak staying in office was critical to any transition. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made clear those were Mr. Wisner's personal views, but they may have encouraged Mr. Mubarak to dig in. Mr. Wisner didn't respond to requests for comment. In Cairo, a tipping point came Sunday, Feb. 6, when the newly appointed vice president, Omar Suleiman, failed to bring opposition groups into a credible dialog to resolve the crisis. Most opposition groups, including protest leaders, refused even to meet with Mr. Suleiman. Those that did denounced the effort afterwards. Then, on Monday, when the protests appeared to be losing steam, Mr. Suleiman said in a televised interview that Egyptians weren't ready for democracy. The comments, with the regime's decision to release a detainee who had become a key figure in the protests, Google Inc.

executive Wael Ghonim, re-energized protests and brought new groups into the streets. On Tuesday night, Vice President Joe Biden, in a telephone call to Mr. Suleiman, laid out precisely what the White House meant by an "orderly transition to democracy," including the immediate lifting of the emergency law. It was the strongest set of demands the U.S. had made. The call all but shut down high-level communications between Washington and Cairo, say U.S. officials. Mr. Mubarak and his allies, including Egyptian diplomats in Washington, were upset and angry at Mr. Obama for moving against the president, according to people familiar with the discussions. That meant the White House had limited access to decision-makers at the top of the regime. "It was very difficult to get the meetings we needed or the calls we needed returned," said one lawmaker familiar with events. The pace of events quickened. Mr. Ghonim, newly released, showed up in Tahrir Square, helping reinvigorate the protests. On Wednesday, Mr. Suleiman met with a steady stream of ruling-party and business leaders relaying the message that Egypt's economy was seriously threatened by the crisis. By Thursday, some of those same leaders were meeting with Mr. Mubarak and urging him to step down. Several say they had the impression he was planning to do that. They were joined in that impression by officials across the Atlantic. Leon Panetta, the Central Intelligence Agency chief, appeared to confirm the reports, telling the House Intelligence Committee Mr. Mubarak was likely to depart Thursday night. He later cautioned that Mr. Mubarak might instead opt to transfer powers to Mr. Suleiman. Mr. Obama, in brief remarks, raised expectations, saying, "What is absolutely clear is that we are witnessing history unfold." Israeli analysts remain concerned about possible new threats to the country's security amid unrest in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East. Special correspondent Martin Himel reports from Tel Aviv.
White House, State Department and Pentagon officials were working their Egyptian contacts Thursday afternoon, though officials acknowledged the difficulty of finding people in the know. But when Mr. Mubarak spoke to the nation on Thursday evening, he delivered an ambiguous message that left protesters furious. Subsequent explanations by his ambassador to the U.S. that the president was handing power to Mr. Suleiman seemed to add to the confusion. Mr. Mubarak also talked that day with an Israeli politician he had known for years, and excoriated the U.S. for what he saw as naively throwing him overboard and ignoring the possibility of extremism surging if he were to go, according to Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a legislator and former cabinet minister. Naguib Sawiris, a prominent Egyptian businessman who had sided with protestors but was also in close contact with the regime, was scathing about what he called a "disastrous" speech that muddled a coherent policy decision crafted over numerous hours by the president's advisers and the army. Mr. Obama watched Mr. Mubarak's speech in the conference room of Air Force One as he flew back from Michigan. Mr. Mubarak's waffling prompted disbelief within the White House. Officials speculated that the Egyptian President made a last-minute personal decision to back away from a clear transfer of power. Mr. Obama, after an extended meeting with his national security team, released the longest statement of the Egyptian crisis, making clear Messrs. Mubarak and Suleiman had muddied the transition process. "The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient," Mr. Obama said. Journal Community A U.S. official said on Friday that the intelligence reports that were shared with the White House in the 48 hours before the announcement that Mr. Mubarak had resigned made it increasingly clear that the regime "was not properly assessing conditions on the ground and that the military was growing more impatient with Mubarak's inner circle." After the speech, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates spoke to Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, Egypt's minister of defense. It was their fifth conversation since the protests started. Officials wouldn't say what they discussed. As the crisis dragged on, relations between Mr. Tantawi and Mr. Suleiman had frayed, according to an Egyptian with close ties to senior military officers. Messrs. Tantawi and Suleiman couldn't be reached for comment. "It seems the army turned and decided it would have to step in when Suleiman failed to get any kind of consensus from the opposition," a person close to the military said. "Everything Suleiman did only exacerbated the situation and more protesters came out." When protesters fanned out en masse on Friday and besieged key government institutions, the military leadership decided it had to act, said a person familiar with their thinking. "The army was cornered," said this person. "They had no choice but to decide to stop this now." That meant pushing Mr. Mubarak to allow Mr. Suleiman to announce he was stepping down. Mr. Obama was meeting with aides in the Oval Office Friday morning when he was handed a note: It contained a transcript of Mr. Suleiman's statement announcing Mr. Mubarak's decision to step down. Mr. Obama then watched the scenes of jubilation in Cairo on TV. How the transition will proceed in the coming weeks and months remains unclear. The high military council now overseeing the process insisted its mandate doesn't replace the Egyptian constitution. But the group offered almost no additional information—such as how it planned to proceed with forming a new government, whether they would scrap or reform the current constitution nor how they plan to handle the affairs of government without a parliament or cabinet ministers. Mr. Mubarak's last acts as head of state may offer some clues. On Tuesday, the former president established a nominally independent panel of ten high-level justices to study constitutional changes, such as allowing for free and fair elections, lifting the decades-old state of emergency and liberalizing media restrictions. Early Friday afternoon, two large brown military helicopters flew out of the presidential palace compound. They banked over the crowd, prompting cheers —and speculation that the helicopters carried President Mubarak and his entourage out of the city. —Richard Boudreaux in Jerusalem and Jonathan Weisman in Washington contributed to this article.

CALLING MUMBAI A MASH-UP would be an understatement. India's most populous city is marked by an unrelenting convergence of high and low: Prada-clad women wait for fresh sugar-cane juice at corner street stalls, and luxury high rises overlook psychedelic street murals. In Mumbai (or Bombay, as most locals still call it), you can rub elbows with bankers, diamond merchants and film producers at velvet-roped bars, then step outside to grab some of the world's best street food and watch the sun set at Chowpatty beach, whose atmosphere turns carnival-like in the evening. Uncomfortably hot in the summer, Mumbai swings into peak travel season now, with foreigners and NRIs (an official-turned-cheeky term for nonresident Indians) showing up in droves for vacations and weddings. Though extreme poverty blights the city, a rich cultural renaissance is under way. Contemporary art galleries are fast multiplying in Colaba, Mumbai's southern district. Boutiques from D7 in the western suburb of Bandra down to Bombay Electric and Le Mill in South Mumbai showcase local designers who marry traditional fabrics with edgy silhouettes. The city's namesake film industry, Bollywood, employs more than 2.5 million people and churns out 700 to 800 movies a year, nearly as many as its American counterpart. Located on India's western coast, Mumbai served as a major port for the Portuguese and then the British from the 16th to 20th centuries. The colonial-style churches and Victorian Gothic buildings that dot the neighborhoods serve as a reminder of the city's past, while a growing number of modern glass-encased high-rises (including Indian industrialist Mukesh Ambani's
much talked-about $1 billion, 27-story home) look to the future. Once you've had your fill of galleries and fine dining, take a 1-hour ferry ride to visit Elephanta Island, where Hindu and Buddhist rock carvings—some dating back to the sixth century—will leave you awe-struck. Or head over to the stunning Chhatrapati Shivaji (formerly Victoria) train station and watch locals dash at rush hour. Mumbai suffers no shortage of shiny new toys, but it's the city's spirit that will have you hooked. —Tanvi Chheda The Foodie: Madhur Jaffrey Actress, food writer and cookbook author Enlarge Image

Bric a Brac // Chor Bazaar. When I first came to America, I went back to Bombay to Chor Bazaar to buy everything. It is filled with an endless amount of things, and wonderful antiques. You'll also find vintage Bollywood movie posters here. Mutton Street, Byculla Rare Eats // Britannia & Co. Parsi food is hard to find outside of private homes. Order the fish patra; and berry pulao, a rice dish made with barberries. And you must have a fresh lime soda. S S Ram Gulam Marg, opposite New Customs House, Fort, 91-22-2261-5264. Bazaar Fruits // Crawford Market. It's basically a market of seasonal produce. If you're there in April or May, you should buy the Alphonso mangoes. Near Abdul Rehman Street, South Mumbai Coco Central // Konkan Café. Beautiful fish with coconut and red chilis. Everything is shipped from the Konkan coast—they have more than a 100 coconuts shipped in every day. Taj President, 90 Cuffe Parade, vivantabytaj.com Street Sweets // Bhendi Bazaar. This area is home to the Dawoodi Bohras, a Muslim community whose roots trace to Egypt and Yemen. You will find the most amazing sweets, such as halwa and jalebi (a sweet and crispy pretzel-like disc), in the lanes here.

Snack and Sleep // The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower. The grand hotel is back on its feet after being heavily damaged in the 2008 terrorist attacks. I like to go to the Sea Lounge and watch the Parsi families trying to arrange matches between their young over tea. Apollo Bunder Road, Colaba, tajhotels.com Great Greens // Shree Thaker Bhojanalay. An eating club that originally catered to migrant workers, it is now comfortably air-conditioned and still serving the greatest vegetarian meals I have ever eaten in a restaurant. 31, Dadyseth Agiary Marg, Kalbadevi, 91-22-2201-1232 Strolling Grounds // Kamala Nehru Park. Everyone calls it the Hanging Gardens. When I'm jet-lagged and up at 5 a.m., I head to the top of the park, which has a fine view of the bay. Ridge Road at the top of Malabar Hill, Malabar Hill Deep Fry // A. Ramanayak Udipi Shri Krishna Boarding. South Indian home cooking served on banana leaves. They will also let you watch as they fry terrifically crisp potato chips. LBS Market Building, 1st Floor, Matunga, 91-22-2414-2422 Words of Wonder // Strand Book Stall. You go to the Strand to look at books, talk about books, buy books. I sometimes shop for American and British novels there and have them shipped back to New York; it's still cheaper. Sir P.M. Rd.

Bombay Electric
Daryl Visscher/Redux Pictures for The Wall Street Journal Sound Stage // Blue Frog. Surreally modern in its décor and design, it's the only place in India that combines a music-centered auditorium with the casualness of a bar. There are international and Indian artists; usually it's a live act followed by a DJ. Mathuradas Mill Compound, Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel, bluefrog.co.in Super Sands // Juhu Beach. I try to spend a minimum of an hour here. It's a place where you really get the vastness of the people that call the city home. Everyone lands up on the beach to have an ice cream with their family. You see quite a variety of people. West Mumbai Star Grazing // Indigo. This restaurant is in a restored bungalow and feels really warm and swanky at the same time. You can do that usual actor spotting, but the food is actually really good. 4 Mandlik Road, Colaba, foodindigo.com Street Style // Fashion Street. Miles and miles of market stall shopping.

Clearwire Corp. has long been the U.S. wireless industry's most embattled carrier. In recent months, the money-losing company has also emerged as its crown jewel. The company, which covers less than half the U.S. population with high-speed mobile Internet service, has teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.

Jesse Hagopian, with hand raised, and other Seattle teachers protested standardized exams Wednesday.
The Seattle Times/Associated Press Teachers at three Seattle schools are refusing to give students district-mandated standardized exams, one of the most dramatic moves in an escalating fight nationwide over using test scores to evaluate teachers and schools. The Seattle boycott, which began in one of the schools and spread in recent weeks, comes after the district decided to make the tests part of Seattle teachers' evaluations this year. But it follows long-standing complaints by the teachers that the computerized exams take up too much instructional time and force schools to close off computer labs for long stretches to administer the exams. "We've been raising our voices about this deeply flawed test for a long time," said Jesse Hagopian, who teaches history at Garfield High School, where teachers initiated the boycott by voting this month not to give the exam. But now that the district is using the test for evaluations, he said, "we've drawn our line in the sand." The spat in Seattle comes as districts nationwide wrestle with how best to use student test scores to rate teachers. In the past three years, more than 25 states have passed laws to link scores to teacher evaluations, because officials think it is a more effective way to gauge performance than traditional reliance on observations by school principals. But as local districts are trying to implement those policies, they are running into some resistance. New York City has forfeited hundreds of millions of state and federal dollars because union and city officials haven't agreed on a new evaluation system that would judge teachers, in part, on student test scores. The Los Angeles teachers union agreed earlier this month to use test scores in evaluations after a protracted fight with the district, and Chicago teachers staged a seven-day strike this past fall, in part, over efforts to judge them on students' test results. Jose Banda, superintendent of Seattle Public Schools, defended the use of testing to rate teachers. He said that student-achievement data is only one component of the district's teacher-evaluation system, which relies heavily on principal observations. "For us, it's just an added piece of the puzzle," he said. Tests have taken on increasing importance in U.S. education since the federal No Child Left Behind became law in 2002. Proponents, including the Obama administration, say assessments are necessary to ensure students are learning and that teachers' effectiveness is properly measured. Some parents and local officials also have resisted the spread of testing. In Texas and Florida, hundreds of school boards adopted resolutions last year asking state officials to reassess state-testing programs. Parents in Washington state and New York City have kept kids home from school on test day in protest. And school-district officials in Oklahoma complained recently about how test scores are factored into controversial new letter grades assigned to schools. Mr. Banda emphasized that the Seattle protests have happened at only a handful of the city's 95 schools. Some of the teachers boycotting the test there say they aren't opposed to using student-achievement data in evaluations but are unhappy with the current exam. The Seattle district requires teachers to give the math and reading Measures of Academic Progress exam, or MAP, to students in first through ninth grade two or three times a year. The exams are "computer adaptive," meaning questions begin at grade level but get tougher or easier based on how well the student does. District officials say the exam allows teachers to pinpoint each student's knowledge and adjust instruction. Seattle teachers complain the exam isn't linked to district or state learning standards. The district's new teacher evaluation system uses results from the MAP and state achievement exams to assign teacher ratings. A low rating triggers additional observations from the principal, who could eventually suggest termination. District officials said teachers can't be fired simply because of a low rating based on student test scores. Matt Carter, a teacher at Orca K-8 School in Seattle, has joined in the boycott because he thinks the MAP exam wastes his student's time and does not help guide his teaching. "If we are using a valid test and it is measuring what I am teaching, than I'd have no problem with it," he said. The district has warned teachers they could face 10 days suspension without pay if they don't administer the test. Pat Hunter, a principal at Maple Elementary in Seattle, said she supports using student-achievement results to guide instruction and as a "small piece" of the overall evaluation. "It's important to use test results, but it's also important that they not become your oxygen." Write to Stephanie Banchero at stephanie.banchero@wsj.com Email

and others that keep consumers from overdosing. For years, consumer-product makers could count on extra sales from shoppers who poured in too much detergent with every load. The phenomenon became more pronounced when manufacturers rolled out increasingly concentrated detergent. But the bubble burst when P&G introduced its new laundry product—Tide Pods capsules—which fixed the amount of detergent used per wash and ushered in the era of "unit dose" products. Total U.S. sales of laundry detergents fell 2.1% in the 12 months to March, according to market-information firm Nielsen, whose data excludes sales from Costco Wholesale Corp.

New products ought to expand the revenue pie for manufacturers and retailers, not shrink it, he said. That is what innovation always did in the past, he said.

Tide detergent on display. The economics of the shift to pods work in favor of Procter & Gamble, which sells more than $4.5 billion in laundry detergent in North America annually. Reuters "Now, what kind of a new product is good when it's hurting the total category?" he said. P&G executives see things differently. Tide Pods represent "the ultimate perfect dose" of laundry detergent, said P&G Chief Executive Robert McDonald,
a former Tide brand manager himself, speaking in an interview. "We are laser focused on making sure consumers get the right dose, and that may have consequences for our competitors." Companies that make packaged foods and household goods have long profited from consumers' tendency to use more than the recommended amounts of their products, said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group and an ex-P&G executive. "Consumers associate larger sizes with more savings and more value, and they tend to over-pour or over-use the products because they don't feel guilty about using more," he said. But the economics of the shift to pods work in favor of P&G, which sells more than $4.5 billion in laundry detergent in North America annually. P&G says it has about 75% of the unit-dose market and is drawing customers from rivals. Consumers pay about 25 cents a load for Tide Pods at Wal-Mart,

versus 20 cents per wash load for bottled Tide and as little as 7 cents for competitors' low-price detergents, according to Deutsche Bank Markets Research. More consumers are also using high-efficiency washing machines, which clean with relatively little detergent. The result, according to P&G, which expects sales of Tide Pods to hit $500 million in the fiscal year ending in June, is that sales of unit dose and higher-priced detergents are growing while the low-end market is losing share. While that is good for P&G, the trend is weighing on the industry as a whole. At United Supermarkets, a Texas-based chain of about 50 supermarkets, laundry detergent sales are flat over the past year, and profits in that category are actually down a bit, said business manager Stephanie Black. Part of the reason is that the chain is selling more unit-dose laundry detergent, like Tide Pods, which have a profit margin up to 5% lower than liquid laundry for retailers. Unit sales of liquid and powdered detergent, meanwhile, are down around 15%. Ms. Black said profit margins on unit-dose detergents are constrained because the wholesale price is already high, so the retailer is wary of putting too much of a markup on it. "We don't lose on them, but we don't make as much of a profit," Ms. Black said. Diane Patten, a 37-year-old attorney in Jacksonville, Ore., said she uses Tide Pods for laundry during ski vacations with her husband and two boys. "They are so convenient…I pack a few in a little container and throw them in a bag" when the family travels, she said. At home, Ms. Patten uses Tide bottled detergent because it is cheaper. "I usually follow the cap measurement unless there is a really filthy load," she said. Consumer products companies have been making their soaps more concentrated for years to save on packaging materials and transportation costs, as well as to make room for more jugs on store shelves. Consumers often responded by reaching for larger bottles and cartons—sizes that felt more familiar— and pouring more than the recommended amount into their washing machines. Church & Dwight is now making its Arm & Hammer bottled liquid detergent more concentrated in the hopes that rivals will follow and industry sales will grow. Adam Lowry,
co-founder of Method Products Inc., which makes highly concentrated detergents that are dispensed like hand soap via a few small pumps, said consumer-goods giants have little incentive to help consumers cut back on overdosing, since it helps send shoppers back to the stores faster to buy more detergent. A major contributor to the overdosing problem, he said, is the oversize laundry jug, which he likens to sport-utility vehicles. The caps tend to be much bigger than the dose for the heaviest loads, he said. As bottles and packages become smaller, Mr. Lowry believes, consumers will be less apt to over-pour. But that is something that detergent-makers won't want to give up. "If you decided to go to a format that eliminated all the consumers overdosing," Mr. Lowry said, "you have a shareholder issue on your hands."

First-time home buyers, long a key underpinning of the housing market, are increasingly getting left behind in the real-estate recovery. Such buyers, typically couples in their late 20s or early 30s, have accounted for about 30% of home sales over the past year. They represented 40% of sales, on average, over the past 30 years, and accounted for more than 50% in 2009, when recession-era tax credits fueled the first-time market,...

BRUSSELS—The U.K. is pushing the European Union to decide this month on whether to blacklist Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah despite continued reluctance among a group of countries to take that step, a number of EU diplomats said Friday. The U.K. on Thursday formally called for the issue to be debated at the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers on July 22. The request, made at a meeting of senior EU officials in Brussels, is...
