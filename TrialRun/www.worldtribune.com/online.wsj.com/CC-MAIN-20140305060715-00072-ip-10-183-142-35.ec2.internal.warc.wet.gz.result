series about a high-school chemistry teacher who turned into a drug lord. Who expected this? Certainly not the Wall Street analysts who are paid to. According to Thomson Reuters, at the start of the year an astonishing 30 of the 36 analysts who covered Netflix rated the stock either a miserable "hold" (which is generally Street-speak for a "sell") or an outright sell. That's about as bearish as analysts get. As recently as last spring, the average target price for the stock was $139. It closed last week at $376. 2 ...Stock markets to soar. Even though U.S. stocks came into the year already overvalued according to many long-term measures, they boomed nonetheless. The S&P 500 posted an astonishing total return of 27%, putting most other major markets in the shade. Who expected this? Not money managers. The Barron's Big Money poll of investment managers in late 2012 showed a big upturn in bearish sentiment. Fewer than half of those polled were bullish on markets for this year. The number of bears, who expected the market to fall, doubled. Enlarge Image
Bill Butcher 3 ...Larry Summers to crash. The great tap dancer of Washington and Wall Street politics finally ran out of dance floor. Mr. Summers, former Treasury secretary, Harvard University president, economic adviser to President Obama and hedge-fund executive, was reported earlier in the year to be the favorite to succeed Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. But Democrats on Capitol Hill put up stiff opposition. As pressure mounted on the president to appoint Mr. Summers's more amenable rival, the eventual pick Janet Yellen,
Mr. Summers bowed out of the race. 4 ...Housing to take off. Mortgage rates leapt this year, as many had long feared. The rise in long-term interest rates, fueled by a strengthening economy, sent interest rates on 30-year conventional mortgages rising a third from 3.3%, at the start of the year, to 4.4% by the end. Though that drove up the cost of buying a new home, the housing market shrugged it off. Prices kept rising, defying the predictions of a correction. A measure of national house prices tracked by Zillow, the online real-estate company, ended the year up more than 5%. Prices in Florida were up 15% on the year, those in California, an astonishing 23%. 5 ...Gold to plummet. According to one reading of the ancient Mayan calendar, the world was due to end in December 2012. But the most fervent fans of gold were almost as gloomy. For years they have been predicting disaster. This year many of their warnings seemed prescient: The U.S. national debt broke $17 trillion for the first time ever. The U.S. government shut down amid political dysfunction and came within days of defaulting on some of its bonds—an economic earthquake that would have shaken the entire global financial system to its foundations. Detroit filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in history. And gold? It fell another 26%, one of the sharpest annual slumps on record, to just over $1,200 an ounce. "It was a bad year to bet on the end of the world," jokes Larry Glazer,
portfolio manager at Mayflower Advisers. 6 ...Japan stocks to boom. A year ago big money managers told Bank of America

Merrill Lynch that they hated the Japanese stock market. Japanese stocks were among the most unloved asset classes in the world. The managers wouldn't touch them with 10-foot poles. How'd that work out? New Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
launched expansionary economic policies and set the stock market on fire. The Nikkei 225 index of top shares rocketed 53% (in yen terms) this year. 7 ...Emerging markets to sink. In the same Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey a year ago, top money managers said their favorite asset class was stocks in supposedly fast-growing "emerging markets" such as China, Russia, India, Brazil, Taiwan and South Korea. They loved these markets as much as they loathed Japan. But emerging markets actually fell 3.5% in U.S.-dollar terms this year, according to index company MSCI. And that's even when you count the dividends. 8 ...The new pope to "occupy." Nobody expected Pope Benedict XVI
to resign, the first to do so in nearly 600 years. And no one expected his successor, Pope Francis,
to launch a scathing critique of the current financial system, attacking "an economy of exclusion," "the new idolatry of money" and "a financial system which rules rather than serves." Enlarge Image
But perhaps people shouldn't have been so surprised. The Holy Father, who hails from Argentina, is said by some to keep by his bedside a radical book which says, among other things, that you cannot serve God and mammon. What's more, it praises an ancient commune in which "all that believed were together, and had all things common. And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need." The book also contains a seditious story which seems to imply there is something wrong with worshiping a golden calf. 9 And certainly not... The world's best-performing stock market this year, according to MSCI, was… anyone? Step forward, Bulgaria, whose market doubled in dollar terms. Other stellar performers included the United Arab Emirates (up 84% in dollars), Argentina (73%) and Zimbabwe (35%). Maybe the Mayans were on to something.

WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats on Tuesday failed to advance campaign-finance legislation that had been a top priority of President Barack Obama, falling short of the 60 votes needed to end a GOP filibuster. The 57-41 vote broke along party lines. It could signal the death, at least in the current Congress, of legislation meant to blunt the impact of a landmark Supreme Court decision striking down major portions of campaign-finance laws that were intended to limit the influence of special interests in political campaigns. Journal Community Among other things, the legislation would force companies and labor unions to disclose more information about their donors and their spending on elections. It is opposed by many of the largest interest groups across the political spectrum, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. Republicans said the bill would impose greater limits on corporations, discouraging them from taking steps on behalf of GOP candidates. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) called it a "transparent effort to rig the fall election for the Democrats." "Unions are the ultimate victors under this bill," he said. Democrats promised to continue fighting for the legislation, even though it could curb support from labor, one of their key constituencies, as they try to tap into the deeper voter anger at the Washington political establishment. Democrats said the court ruling had opened the door for corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence campaigns. They also argued that the bill—by forcing greater disclosure—would empower voters to better understand the political forces trying to shape U.S. elections. "The only ones fearful of transparency are those with something to hide," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.). Enlarge Image
Lack of Senate action on a campaign-finance bill was a blow to one of the priorities of President Obama, shown in the Rose Garden on Tuesday.
Reuters Unless Democrats show some willingness to make accommodations to bring at least one Republican on board, the legislation will remain adrift until after Labor Day, and likely for the balance of the year. Mr. Reid moved immediately after the mid-afternoon roll call to renew Senate action on legislation promoting small-business job creation. Also on the calendar before the Senate begins its August break at the end of next week: the nomination of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, as well as energy and food-safety legislation, and possibly a bill promoting child nutrition. On campaign financing, the landmark Supreme Court ruling in January allows corporations and labor unions to use money from their general budgets to fund television advertisements calling for the election or defeat of candidates for Congress and the White House. Before the decision, these organizations had to fund political ads by collecting smaller donations from individuals. The legislation doesn't directly take aim at the court's ruling, but would impose new conditions on political activities by forcing greater disclosure for all and imposing some limits for corporations and other groups. One of the more controversial provisions of the bill would require independent political entities to disclose the names of the donors to their political advertisements. Opponents said that could discourage corporations from donating to organizations, such as the Chamber of Commerce, that run political ads. Some left-leaning groups also opposed the disclosure requirement, saying it would inhibit donors from giving money. Officially, the Chamber supports pro-business campaigns, but the candidates typically supported by the group are Republicans. "It is obviously written to disadvantage Republicans and favor Democrats," said Sen. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.). In addition, the legislation would prohibit campaign ads sponsored by companies that receive large contracts from the government or have received federal money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program until the money is paid back. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies would also be prohibited from running campaign ads. Unions don't face similar limits. But the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees had called on Democrats to vote against the legislation, in part because of the added paperwork burden imposed on the unions. A similar version of the legislation passed the House earlier this summer. With the Senate at loggerheads, the issue is certain to ripple through the 2010 campaign. Mr. Reid issued a statement this week charging that his Republican opposition to the measure would "let foreign interests buy U.S. elections." The Federal Election Commission already prohibits foreign nationals and interests from spending money in U.S. elections. For years, independent political groups have heavily favored Democratic candidates. Labor unions and wealthy liberals spent about $200 million on an independent effort to back the presidential campaign of Sen. John Kerry in 2004. More recently, pro-Democratic organizations have continued to spend more on campaigns than groups that support Republican candidates. But that could change. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has dramatically ramped up its spending on campaigns and plans to spend more than $50 million on campaign advertisements in the 2010 elections.

Americans are rediscovering their garages—and turning them into luxury showcases for their cars, with high-end finishes, flat-screen TVs, underground car lifts and welding equipment. Sanette Tanaka has details. Photo: Mark Peterman for The Wall Street Journal.
Tim Wellborn's
two-story garage in Alexander City, Ala., spans 14,400 square feet and can fit 12 cars upstairs and six below. The walls are made of New Orleans brick, and the concrete floors are stained to look like stone. For entertaining, there's a Cuban mahogany bar with granite countertops and an eight-seat theater. Pricey Parking
View Slideshow
A million-dollar parking spot: This garage in Alexander City, Ala., can hold 18 cars. It also has a bar and home theater.
Wes Frazer for The Wall Street Journal The total cost: over $1 million. "It's more than our house," says Mr. Wellborn, co-founder of Wellborn Forest Products, a kitchen cabinet manufacturing company that he sold in 2006. Once seen as a catchall space to store bicycles, trash cans and lawn tools, garages are being rediscovered as the ideal place—who knew?—to park cars. Increasingly, many of these spaces are also becoming more lavish—loaded with high-end finishes and man toys, such as flat-screen TVs, underground car lifts and welding equipment. "People are beginning to see that garages can be as cool as the rest of the rooms in the house," says Lou DesRosiers,
president of DesRosiers Architects in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., who has seen a 15% to 20% uptick in garage projects in the past five years. Homes for Sale: Park It Here

In luxury homes, three bays, finished walls and floors, hot and cold running water and heating systems are becoming standard in the garage, says David Pekel,
president and chief executive of Pekel Construction & Remodeling in Milwaukee. Advances in technology and materials, such as iPad-controlled design elements and quieter car lifts that can hold more tonnage, are producing sleeker, more modern spaces. Rick Krug,
co-owner of TR Building & Remodeling in New Canaan, Conn., says his company has seen an estimated 50% increase in garage projects over the past three years. "People want more space, either additions or new construction," Mr. Krug says. "With all the junk you have these days for families, you need that additional bay or additional half-bay to store everything." Last year, Mr. Krug says, he built a 1,500-square-foot garage in Fairfield County, Conn., that holds four cars above ground and one below via subterranean lift that opens into a wine cellar. A lofted living area, complete with a kitchen area and full bathroom, overlooks the space where the cars are parked. The homeowner, who works in sustainable energy, wanted different viewing spaces to look at his high-end electric cars, Mr. Krug says. He put a glass door in between the wine cellar and underground parking space so the owner can "walk into the lift and touch and feel the car from the wine cellar," he adds. The barn-style garage features carriage doors, eastern white pine walls and chestnut stairs and railings. It's outfitted with high-tech gadgets, like two charging stations for the electric cars and iPad-controlled surround sound and lighting. Mr. Krug declined to give the exact cost but said it was more than $1 million. Even garages used for entertaining are designed around the car: the vehicle might be parked on an electronic turntable and surrounded by a bar and seating area. "People love to have their cars on display," Mr. DesRosiers says. "When they have parties, they bring the parties out to the garage." Inside Luxury Garages

This contemporary-style, 5,300-square-foot home in Laguna Beach, Calif., includes a three-car garage with a hydraulic car lift that lowers a showcase vehicle into a parking space in the entry gallery.
Robert A Hansen Mr. DesRosiers recently completed a 6,200-square-foot garage in the suburbs of Detroit that has a 1,800-square-foot detail shop on the lower level with a penthouse above, accessible via elevator. Materials include granite and porcelain tile, mahogany paneling on the walls and chandeliers in the two attached bathrooms. The owners keep specialty cars in this eight-car garage and have a separate six-car garage for their everyday cars. The eight-car project cost $1 million, Mr. DesRosiers says.

Mark Peterson,
a software entrepreneur in the Milwaukee suburbs, outgrew his eight-car garage, which no longer had room for his truck, his three children's cars and his collection of about 30 motorcycles. So he built a new one, which he calls "the ultimate man cave." The 6,000-square-foot space has a main level for vehicles and a lower-level workshop accessible via car lift, designed by American Custom Lifts, an Escondido, Calif.-based company that designs hydraulic and mechanical lift systems. An upper-level loft has a small kitchenette, Oriental rugs, hardwood floors and a leather couch. Mr. Peterson, 50, says he spends most weekends in the garage, watching the Packers or other games on TV with friends or working on motorcycles in his shop. There are seven flat-screen televisions throughout the three levels. "I can build a motorcycle and watch a football game at the same time, which is pretty sweet," he says, adding that the garage cost more than $500,000 to build. Jane Peterson, his wife, helped him with the décor but doesn't spend much time up there. "I'll sit there on occasion, but it's very much a man haven," she says. Instead, Ms. Peterson has a mom cave—an office in the house decorated in sage green, raspberry and yellow florals that looks out over the garden. Roughly 85% of all single-family homes in the U.S. have a garage, and 74% of homeowners with one say that parking cars is its most important use, according to a February survey of 987 homeowners by Home Innovation Research Labs, a subsidiary of the National Association of Home Builders. Even if an existing home has a garage, one or two bays may not be enough. "Those garages are not suitable for today's vehicles. They're just too small," says Mr. Pekel of the Milwaukee construction and remodeling firm. Of new homes built in 2011, 29% have a three-car or larger garage, according to Home Innovation Research Labs. These spaces have more bays, taller ceilings and greater square footage, says Ed Hudson,
director of the market research division at Home Innovation Research Labs. By and large, men are the primary users of garages, at 70% overall, Mr. Hudson says. For some purposes, like maintaining vehicles or working on projects,more than 90% of all users are men. Homeowners who enlarge their garages may see a high payoff when it comes time to sell, says Ray McCarthy,
a real-estate appraiser in Bloomfield, N.J. Building a three-car garage can add about 2% to 3% to the resale value, or roughly $20,000 to $30,000 for a $1 million house, he adds. But a garage that is too customized could be a liability. "When they start to overdo it, when they start putting in the double lifts and customizing the garage, that could hurt the marketability of their house on the next sale," he says. "There's a tipping point. There are still a lot of people who just want to park their car in there and not have anything else." Allen Sunderman,
65, created a 900-square-foot Zen-themed garage in his Paradise Valley, Ariz., home for his 60th birthday and didn't think twice about resale value. "If I would have taken that into consideration, I never would have done it," he says. "This is a space for me and my cars." The interior of the three-car garage was designed by GarageMahals, a luxury custom garage design-and-building firm in Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Sunderman's garage features an epoxy-coated floor, as well as gold- and bronze-colored wainscoting on the walls. A stainless-steel-and-copper bar area is flanked by two slate-backed waterfalls that start running when the garage doors open. Mr. Sunderman, former head of a home-health-care company, likes to unwind with a drink before entering the house. The project cost $150,000, he says. Wayne Burkhart,
68, built a four-car parking garage under his home connected to a four-car working garage. The working garage has a lift and myriad tools, including a milling machine, grinder and welding equipment, so he can restore and build cars. His Nokomis, Fla., home is on the market for $1.1 million, but Mr. Burkhart says he didn't consider resale when he built it. "I built it the way I wanted it. I wanted a bathroom in it; I wanted an office in it; I wanted a urinal in it—and that is what I did," he says. Write to Sanette Tanaka at sanette.tanaka@wsj.com Email

Activision Warns on 'World of Warcraft'
By
Ian Sherr
May 8, 2013 6:53 p.m. ET
Despite a strong first quarter, Activision Blizzard Inc. said its cash cow "World of Warcraft" fantasy game is losing subscribers, and new videogame consoles may not lead to the sales growth some investors expect. Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive, said that while the videogame maker started the fiscal year on a good note, "we now believe that the risks and uncertainties in the back half of 2013 are more...

The months-long conflict between the National Football League and New Orleans Saints players accused of participating in a bounty scheme appears over after former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
who was put in charge of the appeals process by current commissioner Roger Goodell,
vacated all player punishments on Tuesday. Former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue arrives at an attorney's office in Washington on Nov. 30 to take part in a hearing of the pay-for-pain bounty system with the New Orleans Saints.
AP The months-long conflict between the National Football League and New Orleans Saints players accused of running a bounty scheme appears over after former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who was put in charge of the appeals process, vacated all player punishments on Tuesday. Kevin Clark has details on The News Hub. Photo: AP.
Tagliabue, however, found that three of the players engaged in conduct detrimental to the league. He said they participated in a performance pool that rewarded key plays — including hard tackles — that could merit fines. But he stressed that the team's coaches were very much involved. "Unlike Saints' broad organizational misconduct, player appeals involve sharply focused issues of alleged individual player misconduct in several different aspects," said a portion of ruling released by the NFL. "My affirmation of Commissioner Goodell's findings could certainly justify the issuance of fines. However, this entire case has been contaminated by the coaches and others in the Saints' organization." Four players—
Jonathan Vilma,
Scott Fujita,
Anthony Hargrove
and Will Smith,
were suspended for what the NFL called an intent-to-injure program with cash incentives. Vilma, a Saints linebacker, had been given a full-season suspension, while New Orleans defensive end Smith, Fujita, a Cleveland linebacker and Hargrove, a free agent defensive lineman, each received shorter suspensions. Fujita was the only player cleared of conduct detrimental to the league by Tagliabue. None of the players sat out any games because of suspensions. They have been allowed to play while appeals are pending, though Fujita is on injured reserve and Hargrove is not with a team. The NFL said it respects Tagliabue's decision and said the rulings have made clear that the Saints operated a bounty program. Goodell appointed the now-retired Tagliabue to rule on the case as a neutral observer. The initial punishments for the case were lifted just before the start of the season, including Vilma's season-long suspension, so that a clearer ruling could be made. Coach Sean Payton is also suspended for this season. Joe Vitt,
who was suspended for the first six weeks of this season for his involvement in the scheme, remains the Saints' acting coach. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Write to Kevin Clark at Kevin.Clark@wsj.com Email
