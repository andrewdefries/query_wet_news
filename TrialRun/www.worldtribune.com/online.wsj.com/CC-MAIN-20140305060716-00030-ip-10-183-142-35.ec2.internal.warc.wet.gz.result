How do you like dem apples?
And as the sun slowly slips below the horizon of the day,And the starlings rise and dive,And they gaze upon the magnificence with eyes wide shut,And they listen to the sounds of the evening with ears of tin,And they smell and taste the subtle aromas with olfactory of soot,And they barely feel the pain of the passing through their mint julep,Nothing has been learned;Just the same as yesterday, and a thousand days, and a million days ago.Mark you calendars now, and don't miss the sunset on 12/20/2012.And don't forget to do your Christmas shopping early.And do not forget to buy that extra-special gift for that super-special friend.And absolutely do not forget to clean you house, lest your lease not be renewed.Elvis has left the building. Over and out.

OK, hold on tight. I came into this R&E group the day we bombed Libya because I was really pissed and needed to reconcile the whole thing in my mind. I placed the question about 0bama's Christianity. I am an Atheist, but as things progressed, I found myself in conversations about God, which got me thinking about whether I had any issues with God. The question about whether God cared if anyone believed in God just came to me from "out of the blue", and that was followed by my deliberate question about whether God was absolute or arbitrary, which I posted for my own purposes. I found the answer to that after a few more exchanges about God, and when after finding that answer, I found that I was now able to emulate a full faith belief in God without actually believing in God. At that point, the most amazing stuff just started flowing through me mind; I stayed awake for hours overnight with those saws that I post just coming one after another. I proposed elsewhere that maybe God had chosen me as a messenger, which, of course, sounds ridiculous at first blush, but made sense when I thought it out. An Atheist would be the perfect messenger because an atheist has no agenda with God, and would deliver the messages raw and uninterpreted; as opposed to a theist would would taint the messages with their beliefs in God. Of course, I have several other explanations for my mind expansion, but if God wanted to speak through me and it would help this totally f*d up world, then I was happy to oblige; as long as I didn't have to believe God actually exists.So, Tuesday night I was awake when what I wrote above came through. It came quickly, and because of it's length, and because I am not a poet, I decided to get up and post it immediately, lest I forget any of it. It is raw an uninterpreted, but I can't say that some of the words and expressions aren't mine, and if they aren't then God has a great sense of humor. The only line I know is mine is the one about the starlings; the sunset line reminded me of sitting out on the nursing home porch with my mother, just before she died, watching the starlings swoop around as dusk set in,Anyway, the "messages" stopped immediately after that, so everything I write now is back to my own beliefs and philosophies. I will not and cannot tell you what the above "means"; but I can certainly guess as well as anyone else, or maybe better. But I don't think it is for me to interpret it. So, make of it what you will.

Stephen, I believe that everything including dreams happen for a reason, and that there is meaning behind everything. I also believe that if someone believes this he can drive himself quite mad trying to figure out the meaning behind a falling paperclip. We are the story and each little part has its merit. I do believe all things happen for a reason, I just figure "we aint smart enuf to figure em all out".

Not to worry Stephen. You might as well believe in God. No one has enough of the faith it takes to be an atheist. The number of things an atheist needs to believe without proof is far to numerous.

"he can drive himself quite mad trying to figure out the meaning behind a falling paperclip". The important question is: "why would anyone bother to do that?" There are a lot more important things to deal with in life; focusing on the paperclip would be escapism at its worst.So, why do you think this happened to me?

To put you in the frame of mind that you need to be in, in order to continue with the saga that is yours and the world's.I am not one to interpret dreams, I don't have the gift nor the arrogance necessary to tell someone what their dreams mean. (though I do possess an abundance of Arrogance sometimes).Our minds and spirits(souls or what have you), are connected. You have been absorbing a lot of thoughts and different tangents perhaps than normal. Though a couple lines particularly struck me when you spoke of nothing being new. Sounded like Solomon. Vanity, vanity of vanities. There is nothing new under the sun.What'ere the reason may be you are finding it without knowing. For the influence in which it has on your life, this dream, will work itself out in your life through your thoughts.

Daniel,Actually, I would refer to it as a dream, because I don't remember my dreams all that much. I was fully awake when everything came through, otherwise I probably wouldn't have remembered it. However, maybe there were dream segments that I don't remember, and those might surface over time; so, good points there.That's exactly why I asked you for your opinion.

Fascinating. I especially like your penultimate line about cleaning house.
Your thought about being used by God, as an atheist, to deliver a message does not seem strange to me at all. It was the people of Ninevah that God used to send a message to Jonah, not the other way round. Remember also that the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not atheism. You may be closer to God than you know.
Keep listening and telling believers what you hear.
Thanks.

Not "my line", but thanks anyway. And Elvis HAS left the building, but he appears to have left me with some of his arrangments; like a level of deeper understanding. That said, I had commented during the "experience" that my mind felt like it extended out into the entire Universe with a radio telescope where the top of my skull should be. The antenna is still there, but my mind now only wraps around the outside of my entire head, extending out only about the equivalent mental image of about 6 inches. I'll let you know if the messages return, but that final messaged sound, well, final to me.

Stephen,It reminds me of this from Isaiah,"You will be ever hearingbut never understanding; you will be ever seeingbut never perceiving.For this people's heart hasbecome calloused;they hardly hear with their ears,and they have closed their eyes.Otherwise they might see with their eyes,hear with their ears,understand with their hearts and turn,and I would heal them." God cares if you believe in him, see him, hear and understand him.

That does have the same sort of embedded meaning, I guess, but maybe the new one has a bit more of a modern tone. I never read the Bible. And as far as "God cares if you believe in him", that was one of my earlier questions, which I resolved with: "why should God care whether anyone believes in God; God is God". Which to me means that God gave you the "miracle" of life, and gives you rewards that go along with it; if you chose to waste your life, then the rewards are not yours to have. And that applies to Atheists to within my belief system, which does not include God.

Stephen,What I saw in it was the idea that as you look at the sunset with the starlings rising and diving, and you see the magnificence of it all, and hear the sounds and smell the smells and taste the tastes of this world, do you ever look past to see the One who created it all. A person is known when he expresses his thoughts outwardly in some way. How can I know you unless you reveal yourself with words or expressions of some kind. Otherwise you're just a body sitting there, a blank slate. I can't see into your head. God has expressed himself in the creation around us. Do we ever see it as a way to gain an understanding of God? To look past the obvious to see the power behind it all.

Yes, Nancy, there are some amazing coincidences out there, some of which could be considered near "miracles". If humankind happened by accident then it is the only thing that I consider a miracle: something with such long odds against it happening that it is almost mathematically impossible. But I think we were were created, and possibly some of the habitat of Earth as well; but not by God. And I can still marvel at the sunset, and what it takes for that to occur without involving God; and the starlings swooping, as well. For me it's trying to figure out why any and all of that really happens that makes life interesting. I like to keep things simple; but God is too simple an explanation for me.

Mr. Borsher, what an interesting but sad subject! It literally echoes back through the universe and demands answers from mankind. I would like to share with you the following from nineteen century American writer, Stephen Cranes who realistically depicted the predicament of modern man this way:
A man said to the universe:
Sir, I exist.
However, replied the universe,
The fact has not created in me
A sense of obligation:
.
Also written by Crane, I would like for you to look at the following:
If I should cast off this tattered coat, And go free into the mighty sky;
But if I should find nothing there
But a vast blue,
Echoless, ignorant---
What then ?
Now please look at the Psalm 8:
3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 4 what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?[c] 5 You have made them[d] a little lower than the angels[e] and crowned them[f] with glory and honor. 6 You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their[g] feet: 7 all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, 8 the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. 9 LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! What a difference between two world views!
Best wishes!

Lee,I like those."Sir, I exist.However, replied the universe,The fact has not created in meA sense of obligation"This is a big difference between God/Universe and man. When mankind creates something, like a child, it is fully obligated to ensure that child has everything necessary to grow until the child can care for itself (a definition for which I am still searching). God/Universe already gave mankind all the tools necessary to care for itself, including rationality which places us highest on the evolutionary scale on Earth; and yet, we are unable to do so any better than the meanest and cruelest of animals."If I should cast off this tattered coat,And go free into the mighty sky;But if I should find nothing thereBut a vast blue,Echoless, ignorant---What then ? "You had your chance in life; there are no chances after death.Psalm 8:Echoes my first response to Crane. I rest my case.

Mr.Borsher, thanks for your response. It is inevitable for the spiritual beings like us to struggle for faith throughout life like Tennyson wrote in response to his friend’s death:
Behold, we know not anything;
I can but trust that good shall fall
At last—far off—at last, to all
And every winter change to spring
So runs my dreams; but what am I?
An infant crying in the night;
An infant crying for the light;
And with no language but a cry.
Mr. Borsher, you see, with Tennyson, his faith eventually won out, but it took years to resolve his struggle with faith. Everyone has an opportunity to make right before death.
Whether or not one will accept the redemptive work of Jesus Christ as only way of salvation will be largely depend on individual’s choice. So it is with you also that you must make that choice, and nobody else can make that decision for you. Best wishes!

"And with no language but a cry.". See, this is the smarmy, excuse ridden, giving up type stuff that makes humans weak. "We have only but a cry; well, boo-hoo. This is exactly the reason that I don't read the ancients; because none of it applies to me; and if it did, I would already know it anyway. There are many languages that we can speak in and every one of them has its place and time in one's life. When they say someone is trying to find oneself, that is exactly what it means: finding one's own voice. language, and tribe; and that may change over time. If you don;t figure it put until right before your death, then you have wasted your life. I figured it out in my teens, but it took until my 60s to be strong enough to fully implement it; but I did live several distinctly unique lives along the way. And, as far as I can tell, this sickness ridden body of mine will still give me plenty of time to make the most of it.

A tax on travelers who rent cars at Newark Liberty International Airport is helping to fund an animal shelter, a park and a jobs program in New Jersey's largest city. Depending on the viewpoint, that is either a well-earned boon for Newark or a misguided levy on out-of-towners. The 5% tax on car rentals is helping to pay for projects...

President Obama, speaking Thursday in Rockville, Md., ruled out any negotiations over the debt ceiling.
European Pressphoto Agency President Barack Obama
is sticking to his stance that he won't negotiate with Republicans over the government shutdown or the higher-stakes fight over the federal debt ceiling. The question, for Republicans and White House allies alike: How long will that resolve last? Mr. Obama spoke Thursday at a construction company just outside Washington and held fast to his view that Republicans must not attach conditions to bills that underpin the functioning of government. "There is one way out," he said: Republicans must relent and reopen the government. Latest Updates: Budget Battle GOP Group Urges Health-Law Detente White House's Hard Line Has Risks Attached Furloughed Workers Snarl Benefit Systems Treasury Remains Coy About Backup Plan Remark Gives Ammunition to Obama, Reid Obama Presses Boehner for 'Clean' Vote Both Parties Dread Looming, Bigger Cuts Shutdown Washington: Tales of Empty City Alice Rivlin, who was the Office of Management and Budget Director during the 1995 government shutdown, joins the News Hub to explain why this one is different – and more dangerous – than the last. Photo: AP
The White House has insisted it won't negotiate on the debt ceiling, and there is tons of bad blood with the GOP, but it may be forced to do a deal nonetheless. Will there be a breakthrough? Can Democrats stay united? WSJ's Carol E. Lee and Patrick O'Connor explain.
White House officials believe they have the upper hand, citing evidence that some Republicans are buckling under public pressure. Mr. Obama invited the four congressional leaders to the Oval Office Wednesday, and despite the show of engagement made no concessions, according to people familiar with the meeting. House Speaker John Boehner
(R., Ohio) left the White House and said Mr. Obama "reiterated one more time tonight that he will not negotiate." Terry Holt,
a longtime Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama's strategy rests on a cold-eyed calculation that Republicans are the ones with the most to lose. "As long as the president thinks his poll numbers are going to be good, I don't expect the government to reopen," he said. Said a senior administration official: "We are winning...It doesn't really matter to us" how long the shutdown lasts "because what matters is the end result." White House allies, however, say a long shutdown could make the White House's position less tenable. Mr. Obama is the most visible symbol of the U.S. government, they say, and will inevitably share in the blame as hardships mount and people weary of the infighting. Already, the shutdown has produced images of inconvenience, lost pay, and disruptions in wedding and vacation plans. The Republican National Committee has offered to cover the cost of keeping open the World War II memorial for the next month after a group of veterans toured the site even though it was closed due to the shutdown. "To the extent that any blame washes onto the Democrats and the president, it's going to be from the sense that this town is just completely dysfunctional and it's everybody's fault," said Matt Bennett,
senior vice president of Third Way, a center-left think tank. Brendan Buck,
a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said: "Ultimately, politics in Washington is a reflection of the president's leadership. People expect their president to be the grown-up in the room, and he's not even in the room." Mr. Obama said Thursday people should resist the impulse to blame both sides equally. A new CBS News poll showed 44% blame congressional Republicans for the shutdown; with 35% blaming Mr. Obama and Democratic lawmakers. Every day, White House officials tweet fresh reports of new GOP House members who are breaking with their leadership and calling for the government to reopen. Another risk for Mr. Obama is that people may not sympathize with his refusal to negotiate over the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department has said that no later than Oct. 17 it will only have $30 billion in cash—a sum that will be exhausted in one or two weeks, according to the Congressional Budget Office. After that point, Treasury is expected to start falling behind on its bills. Again, Mr. Obama has vowed not to negotiate, saying the consequences of default would be so severe the matter can't be held hostage to political negotiations. "There will be no negotiations over this," he said Thursday. Hoping to drive home that point, Mr. Obama and his White House team have been sounding alarms, warning there are no guarantees that lawmakers will raise the debt ceiling and avoid default. Mr. Obama has been trying to enlist outside allies with ties to Republicans. He met with top CEOs this week to discuss the shutdown and the need for Congress to lift the debt ceiling, and he plans more outreach with other business leaders and various public officials. Shaping the White House's hard line are bitter lessons learned from a standoff in 2011 over the debt ceiling, which resulted in a last-minute budget deal. People close to the president said the White House was too flexible in its dealings with Republicans during that episode. "Looking back on it, we probably did too much accommodating to them," said David Plouffe,
a senior White House adviser during the 2011 fight. "The only way this is going to be resolved, both the shutdown and the next round, the debt ceiling, is going to be [Republicans] relenting." —Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.

is a lot smaller now. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh,
who presided over the jury trial between the two rivals in a California courtroom last summer, on Friday overturned a jury's damage award for about half of the devices at issue in the case. The ruling slashes the amount Samsung is obligated to pay Apple by about $450.5 million, or nearly 43%, to $598.9 million. She ordered a new trial to consider the proper amount owed to Apple for the devices for which she reduced the damages. A Samsung spokesman said the South Korean company was pleased with the jduge's decisions to reduce the jury's award and deny a permanent injunction against its products. "Samsung intends to seek further review as to the remaining award," he said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Judge's Order See the full text of the court order on damages Enlarge Image
The judge's ruling slashes the amount Samsung is obligated to pay Apple by about $450.5 million, or nearly 43%, to $598.9 million.
Getty Images The ruling is a setback for Apple, which has locked horns with Samsung in courtrooms around the world for nearly two years—one of the most prominent in a series of patent battles in the smartphone industry. Last August, the jury found Samsung's devices infringed six Apple patents. Their damage award of slightly more than $1 billion was one of the largest patent awards on record. While reducing the potential financial blow to Samsung—at least temporarily—the ruling could also be a step on the road to settlement. Christal Sheppard,
a former chief patent and trademark counsel for Congress and now a law professor at the University of Nebraska, noted that both companies can now claim victory in this patent battle—Apple, for its initial win and Samsung for its reduction of damages. More Law Blog: Judge Koh Takes Bite out of Apple's Billion Apple Wins Big in Samsung Patent Trial Count by Count: The Apple-Samsung Verdict The Patent Trial of the Century "They've made their point and the devices are no longer relevant," she said, adding that Samsung has since changed its smartphones and tablets so they no longer infringe Apple's patents. "Both sides see some uncertainty in this process and there's little upside." She said it is unclear how the new trial would proceed, but noted that Judge Koh's decision appeared to mirror that of other judges who have complained that there aren't currently good ways to calculate damages in these massive patent battles. Judge Koh's order included discussion of Apple's argument that Samsung's infringing devices caused it to lose profits. As a result, a calculation by one of its experts about how much time Samsung's infringing products disrupted sales, and how much that hurt Apple, was an important part of the jury's final decision. An additional element was when Samsung had received notice that it was infringing Apple's patents, and how many products were sold afterward. In her 27-page order, the judge also discussed Apple's request for additional damages. She said the iPhone maker hadn't given enough evidence of lost profits to justify an increase in its award and neither company had cited enough case law to back up some of their claims. She also noted that due to the way one of Apple's witnesses argued how much the company should be awarded per device for each infringed patent, it was hard to reasonably calculate the right amounts based on various timelines about when Samsung was informed it had been infringing and how much money it had made since. The new trial will involve four Samsung phones—the Gem, Indulge, Infuse 4G and a Galaxy S II sold by AT&T Inc.

In her order, Judge Koh said the jury's award still stands for 14 of the devices targeted in the case, including Samsung's Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S II i9100, Galaxy Tab 10.1 WiFi and its 4G LTE variant, among others.

Young Kim Tests Washington
North Korea says its nukes and missiles are aimed at the U.S. Updated Jan. 25, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
North Korea's National Defense Commission, the country's most powerful body, on Thursday threatened a "higher level" test of a nuclear warhead "targeted at the U.S." The impending test is no surprise, since satellite photos showed preparations almost a year ago. More striking is the vitriol directed at the United Nations Security Council, which on Tuesday approved new sanctions on the North as punishment for its December 12 missile test. Pyongyang accused the other members of the Council of...

WASHINGTON—The White House has promoted a strategy of keeping as light a U.S. footprint as possible in Africa, focusing on training and funding local militaries and providing logistical and intelligence support to African Union-led combat operations. But events in Mali, Algeria and other countries are now spurring a reconsideration of the military role the U.S. should take on the continent, U.S. officials said. Enlarge Image

Google Earth/Reuters Related Death Toll Mounts in Algeria Siege Energy Facilities' Poor Security The White House and African analysts have voiced fears that a more direct U.S. role could weaken local governments and further inflame Islamist extremism. U.S. officials have also questioned the direct national security threat posed by such Africa-based militants as AQIM, Somalia's al-Shabaab militia and the Lord's Resistance Army in central Africa. Obama administration officials said this strategic view is being challenged by the rising terrorist activities in North Africa, including the abduction this week of Western hostages, including Americans, working at a natural-gas field in Algeria. Reports that the militants are demanding the release of two Islamic extremists from American prisons have emphasized their conflict with the U.S. The hostage crisis follows September's terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans. Piracy linked to Islamist extremists also is posing a rising threat to international shipping off Africa. Some American military officials said this week that AQIM, which is also active in Libya, Morocco, and Algeria, has grown more dangerous, more quickly than many assumed several years ago. The Obama administration this month said it is providing limited logistical and intelligence support to a French military intervention in northern Mali, where Islamists militants fighting under the banner of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, have carved a regional haven. Enlarge Image

Algerian TV/Reuters The quick rise of Islamist militants, officials said, may mean that drones assigned to hunt al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan, or al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, could be reassigned to Africa. Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that he still doesn't see a cohesive administration approach to countering gains by al Qaeda and Islamist militants across the continent. "You have to have an overarching policy that puts pressure on these groups from every corner," he said. "That is what's missing." President Barack Obama
could visit Africa this year, making stops in several democratic countries, administration officials said. Africa emerged as a national-security challenge for Mr. Obama during his first term, even as he sought to focus on winding down the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and pivot U.S. military assets to Asia to deter the rising power of China. Hostage Crises A look back.

The Obama administration launched military airstrikes in Libya in 2011 in support of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization campaign that helped overthrow the late leader Moammar Gadhafi's government in Tripoli. The Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency have also lent significant support to countries including Somalia and Uganda in their fights against powerful Islamist militias. The current U.S. strategy emphasizes both counterterrorism operations and what the administration calls "building partner capacity." As part of the military's strategy under Mr. Obama, an Army brigade will send small teams of soldiers to Africa to train local militaries. The U.S. also has special operations teams conducting training missions in central Africa, where governments in Uganda, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo are combating the Lord's Resistance Army, a regional militia that promotes an ideology based on mysticism, tribalism and Christianity. Somalia, in particular, is being touted as a success story by the Obama administration, which renewed U.S. diplomatic relations this week with Mogadishu for the first time in 20 years. Somali troops have been fighting a protracted war with the al-Shabaab Islamic militia, which looked poised just a few years ago to take power. "Today, thanks to the extraordinary partnership between the leaders and people of Somalia, with international supporters, al-Shabaab has been driven from Mogadishu and every other major city in Somalia," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday following a meeting with Somalia President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. U.S. officials involved in Somalia said the weakening of al-Shabaab was achieved through extensive American military training and intelligence cooperation with Mogadishu, as well as economic assistance. They also cited the role of African Union troops, from countries including Uganda, Burundi and Kenya, in supporting the Somali government's fight against al-Shabaab. Though weakened, al-Shabaab this week claimed to have executed a French hostage; French officials said he was believed to have been assassinated days earlier during a failed rescue attempt. Roger Carstens, a former Army Special Forces officer who helps train Somali forces in East Africa, said America should embrace a lean strategy that avoids sending in its own forces to fight wars across Africa. "The future of warfare in Africa is going to be an odd mixture of odd tactics from the 1970s and new technology like drones, with less boots on the ground," said Mr. Carstens, who serves as a country manager in Somalia for Bancroft Global Development, a private firm that helps train the nation's military forces. Some counterterrorism experts in Washington question if the Obama administration will be able to keep itself out of a more direct fight. They cited, in particular, the French intervention in Mali, and the risks posed to the region if Paris is unsuccessful in crippling the al Qaeda-linked militias fighting there. "Now that the intervention has been made, now that we are providing at least some aid to the French, it's better to ensure we finish this off than to let it drag on," said Bruce Hoffman, an al Qaeda specialist at Georgetown University. He noted that last year's NATO campaign in Libya should serve as a cautionary tale to Washington. The U.S., he said, was able to limit its direct military involvement and succeeded in helping to overthrow Gadhafi. But he said Islamic extremists maintain a strong presence in the North African country, and were directly involved in the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi in September. "In Libya, we led from behind, and I don't think the long-term outcome has necessarily been to our advantage," Mr. Hoffman said. "It hasn't left a stable country, and it's created new problems. I don't think we can afford to repeat the situation in Mali or Algeria." Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Julian E.

By
Jeb Bush
Updated March 15, 2013 6:50 p.m. ET
My dad recently said, "Put away the harps!" He was speaking about his health, but I believe what he said applies to the conservative movement and the future of the country. Americans have the sense that the economy is fragile, that its rewards are unfairly tilted toward the few, and that the greatest prosperity in this century will be enjoyed by people in other lands and not by our children. This conclusion is wrong. America could be on the threshold of its greatest century. With new drilling technologies, the United States will soon have an energy surplus. This means trillions of dollars in new wealth and a foreign policy not dominated by oil. Enlarge Image
David Gothard Given advances in agriculture and bioengineering, America could be the Saudi Arabia of grain in a century when the world is clamoring for more food. Wireless communication, artificial intelligence and rapid advances in life sciences are transforming every facet of American business and daily life. Entire classes of diseases are on the verge of being eradicated by manipulating individual molecules on the surfaces of living cells. Technological innovation means that in the coming decades, driverless vehicles will flawlessly move people and products on our highways, never getting lost, never having accidents. The development of 3D printing machines is racing ahead—and they will be down-scaled for home use, so that consumers can instantly create thousands of objects at the touch of a button. This country is younger than all other industrialized nations, and if we get immigration right, we're going to stay young. By 2050, China will have more old people than the United States has people. These are but a few of the country's advantages, and collectively they point toward a century of unparalleled prosperity and world leadership. But the bright future is at risk if the federal government continues on its arc of irresponsibility. America's government-spending addiction and its lackluster system of public education are the two greatest impediments to achieving the country's potential. I know conservatives have the solution. As governor of Florida, I balanced the state budget for eight years in a row while cutting taxes every year. I have dedicated my adult life to revolutionizing schools to make them serve children and parents and not an indifferent bureaucracy. All Republican successes at the state level can be undone if the GOP continues to lose presidential elections. The party will forfeit its opportunity to chart a better future for the republic. In the last six presidential elections, more than 20 million times, Americans made the conscious decision that someone other than a Republican offered the nation a better future. This is because too often the conservative message was focused on what we are against, not on what we support. We can learn from our mistakes. We must move beyond the divisive and extraneous issues that currently define public debate. The Republican Party must not write off entire segments of American society by assuming that its principles have limited appeal. For the same reason that millions of immigrants from every nation were drawn to American shores, we need to draw into the Republican Party people from every corner of society. That can be done, because conservative principles, not liberal dogma, best reflect the ideals that made this nation great. These core principles—greater individual responsibility, more personal freedom, smaller and more effective government—are the only principles that empower people to rise to the top, to raise a family and to be free. The face of the Republican Party needs to be the face of every American. Real relationships take time to grow, and they begin with a genuine interest in the stories, dreams and challenges harbored within each of us. I met Berthy Aponte,
the mother of a developmentally disabled child, at a campaign stop in 1998 when she stood up and challenged me to help children like hers. Over the following months, I traveled Florida with Berthy, visited group homes, and talked to parents who feared nothing more than having their disabled child outlive them and become the ward of an uncaring state. My personal connection with Berthy caused me, as a governor, to have a renewed focus on helping the developmentally disabled. Elevating their lives elevated the lives of all Floridians. Today, the sad reality is that if you're born poor, if your parents didn't go to college, if you don't know your father, if English isn't spoken at home—then the odds are stacked against you. You are more likely to stay poor today than at any other time since World War II. Conservatives have allowed liberals to channel the anger and frustration that comes from this oppressive dynamic to attack the very idea of success itself. In their view, anyone who has climbed to the top 1% has committed some form of gross social breach and deserves scorn. This is enormously shortsighted. In a fair capitalist system, financial success should be the byproduct of innovation and achievement. The central mission of conservatives is to reignite social mobility in this country—restoring the right to rise. First, America needs a government that allows both small people to rise and large businesses to fail. Government has a role in regulating, but its role shouldn't include picking the winners and losers. Second, the country needs to equip every child with the best tools to rise—a quality education. The U.S. spends more per pupil than any other country yet these pupils frequently rank in the bottom 20% on international math and science tests. Somewhere in America a child is being born whose bold idea may save a life, or the lives of millions. For every child who reaches his full abilities, there are a hundred who could have done the same but are stuck in failing and indifferent schools. Reform-minded conservatives have the resolve and the record to confront and end this tragic waste of human potential. America needs an education transformation based on standards benchmarked to the best of the world, a system of no-excuses accountability that refuses to accept failure and rewards excellence. The country needs a culture based on empowering parents with an abundance of choices and a deep understanding of the transformative power of digital learning. Third, Americans need to reestablish that success is a good thing. We do this by offering role models who demonstrate that success begins with a bold idea, that it is often created where nothing formerly existed, and that the resulting wealth can spread to every part of the nation. Fourth, America needs a new, forward-thinking immigration system that replaces the failed status quo, meets the country's economic needs and honors its immigrant heritage and the rule of law. For the millions who are here illegally, there should be a path to bring them out of the shadows and into legal status. This path could eventually include citizenship, as long as those who have been waiting patiently to enter the country legally receive priority. Finally, each of us in the conservative movement needs to recognize the limits of government and the much more powerful influences of parents, churches, charities and role models. There is a political realm and a social realm, and we shouldn't confuse the two. Government should fill potholes. It is our individual duty to fill the holes in the human heart. Conservatives can do so much more by setting an example and living by our principles than by merely talking. We need to be out in our communities helping neighbors, mentoring children and demonstrating that generosity, compassion and human potential are immensely more powerful than a thousand government programs. There is a path forward as conservatives, and our future is extraordinarily bright. We have within our grasp the means by which our country will reclaim its momentum, leave its indelible imprint on this remarkable century and secure a better future for all. Mr. Bush
was the Republican governor of Florida from 1997 to 2007. This op-ed is adapted from his remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday. Email

A Revitalized Car Industry Cranks Up U.S. Exports
By
Christina Rogers and Neal E. Boudette Updated July 2, 2013 12:03 a.m. ET
MARYSVILLE, Ohio—The U.S. auto industry, in tatters just four years ago, is emerging as an export powerhouse, driven by favorable exchange rates and labor costs in a trend experts say could drive business for many years. In a sign of the turnaround, Honda Motor Co., once a big importer of Japanese-made cars, says it expects to export more vehicles from North America—with nearly all of them coming from its U.S. factories—than it brings...

Central Banks' Change of Heart Bears Fruit By
Simon Nixon
Updated Jan. 20, 2013 6:45 p.m. ET
Suddenly there are signs of optimism everywhere—at least in the markets. Some equity indexes have risen to their highest levels since the start of the global financial crisis. U.S. equity funds have seen their strongest inflows since 2007. European bank stocks are trading back close to book value and, according to Morgan Stanley, "are out of the Bermuda Triangle." In the corporate-bond market, spreads have narrowed sharply to levels not seen since the boom and issuance has been exceptionally strong. Yields on the sovereign bonds of countries hit by the euro-zone crisis have tightened dramatically. The...
