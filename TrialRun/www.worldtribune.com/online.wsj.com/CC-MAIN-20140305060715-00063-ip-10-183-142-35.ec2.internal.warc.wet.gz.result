Fairview Farms
Fairview Farms As European winemakers brave freezing temperatures to finish their winter pruning, more than 12,000 kilometers away South African vineyard workers are battling the heat as they prepare for this year's harvest. With temperatures rising to as high as 35 degrees Celsius, the first grapes to ripen are the Sauvignon Blanc, then Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, followed by Pinotage, Chenin Blanc and Merlot. The next sweep through the vineyards includes Syrah, Cabernet Franc and finally, as we move into March, Cabernet Sauvignon. Drinking Now Three South African wines that are ready to impress.

This trio of bold red grape varieties may be last into the cellar, but any aficionado who appreciates brooding, dark oak-aged red wine will tell you, these are definitely worth the wait. Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah may make up only 22% of South Africa's vineyard plantings but together could represent an entree into the higher echelons of the world's fine-wine market. In terms of quality, the wines of the Western Cape, in particular, have made great strides in the past decade. Meerlust, Warwick, Kanonkop, Rustenberg and Vergelegen wine estates are just a handful of producers making world-class red wine based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Fairview, Boschendal, Graham Beck and Delheim are doing the same with Syrah. I have written it before and I will go on writing it because these wines offer some of the best-value reds in the fine-wine category in the world. In the Western Cape, Cabernet Sauvignon—with its dark-blue skins and tightly packed bunches—when blended with Cabernet Franc and Merlot, produces wines of exquisite Old World charm. By which I mean wine that smells and tastes like it comes from Bordeaux, with aromas of cedar, cassis, pencil shavings and mint, while retaining that freshness when it is swallowed. While critics and those familiar with these wines have been seduced, prices haven't risen as much as those of counterparts in California, Italy and France. I can't think of another region that on a price point of £10-£25 (€12-€30) consistently punches well above its weight. In blind tastings, I have served Stellenbosch's Meerlust Rubicon (a Bordeaux blend) against some of the very best châteaux from the Medoc and found it not only held its own but also outperformed its European counterparts. Perhaps we should think of South African wines in the context of Europe and the Old World. It maybe a little more than 20 years since the end of apartheid opened up the wine industry to the wider world but vines have been tended in this corner of the globe since the mid-17th century. While the white grape variety Chenin Blanc still remains the most planted in South Africa, its percentage of vineyard area has fallen in the past 10 years. Following apartheid, a generation of South Africans were able to travel and with that has come a wave of well-traveled winemakers who, having seen the potential of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah overseas, have returned home with a fresh perspective. Stellenbosch's Oldenburg Vineyards, bought by equity trader Adrian Vanderspuy in 2003, are a case in point. Having been bitten by the wine bug in 2001 after a taste of Thelema Cabernet Sauvignon, Mr. Vanderspuy, who has a deep-rooted history with Stellenbosch, says he recognized that the region's cool, maritime breezes and varied soils had the potential to make great red wine. In 2004 he replanted the farm with Syrah and Cabernet Franc, which were joined by Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot a year later. The first vintage was in 2007. He says that both a rise in domestic quality across the Western Cape and growth in fine-wine prices mean that in the next decade an iconic wine will emerge from South Africa. One could argue wines such as Waterford Estate's the Jem; Bruce Jack's single-vineyard Pinotage and Kanonkop's Black Label Pinotage are already gaining traction. But I wouldn't bet against Oldenburg's straight Cabernet Franc joining the fray, either. —Email Will Lyons at william.lyons@wsj.com or follow him on Twitter: @Will_Lyons. Explore More
