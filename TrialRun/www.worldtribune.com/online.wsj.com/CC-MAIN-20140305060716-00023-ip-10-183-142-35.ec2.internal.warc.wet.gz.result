TIDMRPS RNS Number : 6532V RPS Group PLC 16 January 2013 RPS Group plc ("RPS" or "the Group") Expansion of RPS's Energy Training business. RPS announces the acquisition of Petroleum Institute for Continuing Education ("PEICE"), a Canadian based business providing geoscience and engineering training to the oil and gas industry, for a maximum consideration of C$11.7 million (GBP7.4 million). PEICE has been providing high quality training to the oil and gas industry for 12 years. During 2012 it delivered over 200 courses, primarily in Canada and the US. The courses cater for a wide range of participants including recent graduates and technical and administrative support staff, as well as senior energy company staff. Course formats include open courses, in-house at client facilities and on-line delivery. The founder and joint owner (with his wife) of the business will be remaining with RPS after the transaction, along with all current PEICE staff. They will work with RPS' existing energy training teams in the UK and US to extend the range of courses offered and the geographical reach of the business. In the year ended 31 August 2012 PEICE had revenues of C$7.4 million (GBP4.7 million) and profit before tax of C$2.0 million (GBP1.3 million), after adjustment for non-recurring items. Net assets at 31 August 2012 were C$0.4 million (GBP0.25 million). On the same basis, gross assets at 31 December 2012 were C$1.0 million (GBP0.6 million). RPS is acquiring the entire share capital of PEICE for a maximum total consideration of C$11.7 million (GBP7.4 million), all payable in cash. Consideration paid at completion was C$5.7 million (GBP3.6 million). Subject to certain operational conditions being met, two further sums of C$3 million (GBP1.9 million) will be paid on the first two anniversaries of the transaction. Alan Hearne, Chief Executive of RPS, commented: "The acquisition of PEICE extends the geographical reach and capability of our existing energy training business. This remains a growth market, as technical training continues to be important for most of our E&P clients." 16 January 2013

NEW DELHI—An Indian consular official indicted in the U.S. for alleged visa fraud returned home Friday after a nearly monthlong legal and diplomatic tussle that continues to strain ties between New Delhi and Washington. The return of Devyani Khobragade, a deputy consul-general stationed in New York, is unlikely to result in an immediate improvement in relations between the U.S. and India, a country the Obama administration has hoped...

NEW DELHI—One of India's largest publishing houses agreed to withdraw and pulp all copies of a book about Hinduism written by a prominent American scholar after a legal battle with a nationalist group. Some conservative Hindus have attacked the 2009 book, "The Hindus: An Alternative History" by University of Chicago religious historian Wendy Doniger for describing Hindu texts as fictional and giving them a sexualized...

THE REASON FOR the season may have been born in a lowly manger, but the French fête his birthday with foie gras, truffles and expensive candy. Those who dine out in Paris at Christmas will spend mightily, but most locals celebrate at home, where they can enjoy extravagant eating for a fraction of the price. Here are some suggestions for enjoying Christmas food in Gallic style. Truffles Enlarge Image
Black truffles
The prized winter black truffle or truffe noire (Tuber melanosporum) comes into peak flavor around the holidays. Those lucky enough to afford (or find) their own will slice them thin and insert them under the skin of roast poultry or use them to garnish seafood. They are not called "black diamonds" for nothing—at the time of writing a 50g truffle (10g per person is considered generous) cost €160 at La Grande Épicerie ( lagrandeepicerie.com ), which has the largest, most luxurious selection in Paris, and €84.50 at the ever-reliable La Maison de la Truffe ( maison-de-la-truffe.com ), which has a branch in Hamburg and sells through Harrods in London. Instead, most people rely on a trusted charcutier such as Gilles Verot ( verot-charcuterie.fr ) or a fromager such as Androuet, which has branches in London, Bath and Stratford-upon-Avon, as well as Stockholm ( androuet.com ). But beware, cheap truffles may be counterfeits cultivated in China and doused with artificial truffle essence. Go instead for truffes en morceaux—smaller or broken pieces packed in truffle juice, or pelures (the diced-up rind), which are half the price of a whole truffle, and can be mixed into salts, butters and creams. Foie gras Enlarge Image
Bread with goose liver pate and roasted chestnuts
Bernard Grilly / StockFood The fattened livers of ducks and geese are legally designated part of the country's "cultural and gastronomic heritage" and the French ate more than 19,000 tons of the stuff last year, most of it bought at the year-end. It is most commonly served as a spreadable terrine or pâté, but can also be seared and served as a quivering slab, alone as a starter, or melting like a luxurious condiment into grilled steak or duck confit. Foie gras made from duck (canard) is far more affordable than the small amount—less than 10%—made from goose (oie), and it is also better suited to being served warm. The intense fattiness of foie gras is best balanced out by a sweet wine such as Sauternes or Jurançon, or fresh or jellied fruits such as fig or apple. Toasted brioche is a traditional accompaniment but fig or spice bread can also be lovely. La Grande Épicerie has the largest range, but even the smallest supermarkets will be selling foie gras in late December. Marrons Glacés and Bûches de Noël Enlarge Image
Candied chestnuts
Candied chestnuts are among the most expensive sweets in Paris, at €3-€4 for a single piece, because each batch of meltingly rich marrons glacés takes three days to prepare. At this time of the year you should be able to buy them at almost any chocolate or pastry shop. Then there's the bûche de Noël—typically a rolled and filled sponge cake decorated with icing to imitate bark and undergrowth. I'm a fan of Pierre Hermé ( pierreherme.com ) but if you aren't prepared to drop €80 on a bûche for six, Arnaud Larher ( arnaud-larher.com ) has miniatures for less than €10—and sells marrons glacés by mail order.

The current recall of Toyota vehicles for unintended acceleration is the largest recall in Toyota's history, and one of the largest automotive safety recalls ever. Paul Ingrassia's Jan. 29 op-ed, "Toyota: Too Big, Too Fast," incorrectly said the recall is the largest in automotive history. *** The Institute for Advanced Study is not affiliated with Princeton University. Due to an editing error, the Jan. 30 letter from Bill Bailey incorrectly said it was.

The field of Democratic candidates to replace Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D., Ill.), who resigned last week amid a criminal probe of his financial activities, was already more than a dozen strong. And it got bigger yesterday when former Rep. Mel Reynolds, who held the seat from 1993 to 1995, announced he would try to win it back. Mr. Reynolds's bid is a long shot. He too resigned from Congress in disgrace and went to jail for bank fraud and sex with a minor. But what worries the black Democratic establishment is that Mr....

Following the lead of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., three of the largest money-market-mutual-fund firms said Wednesday they would begin disclosing the values of their funds each day, in a move that could shift the fierce debate in Washington over how to regulate the $2.7 trillion money-fund industry.

The reports of Paula Broadwell's affair with former Central Intelligence Agency chief David Petraeus have done nothing to bolster her credibility as his biographer. But one thing she said often while promoting the book seems to be plausible: that many of the interviews between the two were conducted during grueling fast-paced runs. Enlarge Image

Former CIA chief David Petraeus and his biographer Paula Broadwell.
ISAF/Getty Images According to the race-result aggregator Athlinks, Broadwell finished a half marathon in her hometown of Charlotte last November in 1:36:26, for a pace of 7:21 minutes per mile. Out of 1,353 women, she finished 12th—which is pretty impressive. Of six Broadwell performances listed on Athlinks, last November's half marathon (13.1 miles) represents her fastest pace, topping even the speed at which she ran a couple of measly five-kilometer (3.1-mile) races in 2008. But maybe that was the effect of training with Petraeus. According to Athlinks, Petraeus, who is 60, ran a 2006 five-mile race at a blistering 6:46 pace and a 2002 10-mile run at a pace of 6:22. This July, a month that is sweltering in Charlotte, Broadwell, who is 40, ran a 15-kilometer race there and posted her slowest-paced finish of those six on Athlinks, an 8:18-per mile performance. In running circles, Broadwell has been criticized by some who believe she claimed—during a book-promoting interview in January with broadcast host Don Imus—to have run six-minute miles with Petraeus. But the transcript of that interview suggests she stopped short of claiming she could keep up with the speedy general. "He can run six-minute miles," Broadwell said. "A couple weeks ago we ran ... probably a little slower than that ...probably at (a) 7-something pace." —Kaitlyn Kiernan
