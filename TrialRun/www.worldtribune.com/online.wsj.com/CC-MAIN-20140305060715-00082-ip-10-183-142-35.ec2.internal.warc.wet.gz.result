WASHINGTON—Polls show that expanding background checks to cover all gun sales, not just those by licensed dealers, is one of the most popular measures being considered by the White House to curb gun violence. There's one problem: The system President Barack Obama
and many lawmakers hope to expand is full of holes. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which federally licensed firearm dealers must use to check the credentials of potential gun buyers, doesn't include millions of people legally barred from owning guns, researchers and advocates say. Fourteen states list fewer than five people flagged for mental-health issues. Enlarge Image

Researchers also found major gaps in filing records of known drug offenders, who are temporarily prohibited from buying firearms. But states are much better at reporting the names of people convicted of felonies, researchers found. "Many states are still failing to do the bare minimum," said Mark Glaze,
director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which studied the matter in a 2011 report. "We know they have hundreds of thousands of records sitting in state agencies." Mr. Obama is slated Wednesday to detail his policy response to the Newtown, Conn., elementary-school shooting that killed 20 children and a total of seven adults last month. An expansion of the gun-check system will be among his proposals, people briefed on the matter said. The proposal would extend gun checks to all sales at gun shows and to private transactions between individual buyers and sellers, these people said. Currently, only sales by a federally licensed dealer are subject to gun checks. Federal law prohibits the sale of firearms to convicted felons, recently convicted drug users and individuals adjudicated to be mentally unfit, among others.

Mr. Obama also is expected to propose ways to improve reporting to the existing system. Possibilities include directing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to prod states to submit more records, upgrading technology to automatically notify law enforcement when someone fails a background check and improving incentives for states to submit records. The latter would require congressional approval, as would any expansion of the system. Alan Gottlieb,
founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights research and education group in Bellevue, Wash., said that past efforts to expand the background-check system have included unacceptable provisions such as making organizers of gun shows criminally liable for errors. In addition, he said, the background-check system tends to break down on weekends, when gun shows often swell traffic. Mr. Gottlieb isn't necessarily opposed to expanding the system, however. "If you have a law that says certain people are prohibited from having a firearm you should be able to check it. That makes common sense to me," he said. Gun-control advocates have helped highlight these flaws, but some also worry that focus on the system's holes will be used as an excuse to block legislation requiring universal use of the background check system. An estimated 40% of all gun sales are private and therefore exempt from any background check, offering prohibited buyers a ready avenue to obtain guns, said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "If you're a bad guy planning to do something bad on an airplane and you have a choice of going through an airport that has metal detector and or one that doesn't, which will you go through?" he asked. New York state took steps Tuesday to bolster its background-check system as part of firearm-restrictions legislation that Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law. People deemed "likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others" by mental-health professionals would be added to a state database for checks. The gaps in the federal database trace back to a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down part of a law requiring states to report mental-health records, ruling that states could share such records as they wished. Today, eight states account for 84% of the database's mental-health records, according to an analysis by the mayors' group. Separately, the Government Accountability Office found that a dozen states accounted for the vast majority of mental-health records and that "most states have made little or no progress in providing these records." Still, some states have made strides, contributing to a 40% increase in mental-health records reported from October 2011 to October 2012. Two years ago, Delaware Gov. Jack Markell
pushed a new law to overcome state privacy laws that prohibited data sharing. By late last year, the state had reported about 18,700 records, or the second most per capita in the nation, up from zero before the new law. "It was ridiculous that we have this information and we weren't reporting it," said Mr. Markell, a Democrat. "A background check is only as good as the records in the database, so I think we all have a responsibility to report" mental-health records. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, an advocate of gun rights, has also focused on the importance of the national database since Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and himself at Virginia Tech in 2007. Last year, Mr. McDonnell sent a letter to the nation's governors urging them to improve their states' reporting of mental-health records. Mr. Cho was able to purchase guns used in the crime despite a court ruling that he was mentally ill. That ruling wasn't reported to the national database because of a loophole in Virginia law. Since then, the state has amended the law and now has reported more records per capita than any other state. After the Virginia Tech shooting, Congress passed a law to encourage states to report mental-health records by offering grants and threatening to dock federal funding if states don't meet certain thresholds. Some states said the penalty would be more of an incentive to boost reporting, the GAO said, but the Justice Department has yet to penalize any state. — Gary Fields andTamer El-Ghobashy contributed to this article.

Infants at risk for food allergies should be gradually introduced to suspect foods to build up tolerance, according to new recommendations from a leading allergy doctor group. WSJ's Sumathi Reddy joins Lunch Break with a look at the evidence. Photo: AP.
Parents trying to navigate the confusing world of children's food allergies now have more specific advice to consider. Highly allergenic foods such as peanut butter, fish and eggs can be introduced to babies between 4 and 6 months and may even play a role in preventing food allergies from developing. These recommendations regarding children and food allergies—a rising phenomenon that researchers don't fully understand—come from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology in a January article in the Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology: In Practice. The AAAAI's Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee outlined how and when to introduce highly allergenic foods, which include wheat, soy, milk, tree nuts, and shellfish. Enlarge Image

Highly allergenic foods such as peanut butter, fish and eggs can be introduced to babies between 4 and 6 months.
Getty Images The recommendations are a U-turn from 2000, when the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines that children should put off having milk until age 1, eggs until 2 and peanuts, shellfish, tree nuts and fish until 3. Getty Images The recommendations are a U-turn from 2000, when the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines that children should put off having milk until age 1, eggs until 2 and peanuts, shellfish, tree nuts and fish until 3. In 2008, the AAP revised its guidelines, citing little evidence that such delays prevent the development of food allergies, but it didn't say when and how to introduce such foods. Food allergies affect an estimated 5% of children under the age of 5 in the U.S., according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The prevalence of a food allergy for children under 18 increased by 18% from 1997 to 2007. "There's been more studies that find that if you introduce them early it may actually prevent food allergy," said David Fleischer,
co-author of the article and a pediatric allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver. "We need to get the message out now to pediatricians, primary-care physicians and specialists that these allergenic foods can be introduced early." Dr. Fleischer said more study results are needed to conclusively determine whether early introduction will in fact lead to lower food-allergy rates and whether they should be recommended as a practice. The first trials to split children into groups, with some eating highly allergenic foods early on and others delaying, are continuing in the United Kingdom and Australia with some preliminary results expected to be out next year. This type of trial with children is rare and the results are highly anticipated. One theory to explain why early introduction is important holds that if babies aren't exposed early enough to certain foods, their immune systems will treat them as foreign substances and attack them, resulting in an allergy. "The body has to be trained in the first year of life," says Katie Allen,
a professor and allergist at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute at Royal Children's Hospital in Australia. (The institute was founded in part by the late Dame Elisabeth Murdoch,
mother of Rupert Murdoch,
who is chairman of News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.) "We think there's a critical window, probably around 4 to 6 months, when the child first starts to eat solids," she says. Another possible explanation from some experts for the increase in allergies: As westernized countries have become more hygienic, children don't have the same exposure to germs, which affects the development of the immune system. Dr. Allen believes there may be a link between food allergies and vitamin D. In a study out this week in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, researchers took blood samples from more than 5,000 babies and found that those with low vitamin D levels were three times more likely to have a food allergy. Food-allergy reactions range from hives and eczema to asthma, vomiting and anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction in which the body's major systems quickly shut down. A 2011 prevalence study in the journal Pediatrics found that 39% of children with food allergies have a history of severe reactions. The new recommendations include introducing highly allergenic foods after typical first foods have been eaten and tolerated, such as rice cereal, fruits and vegetables. They suggest children be fed the foods at home and in gradually increasing amounts. The AAAAI recommendations cited about half-a-dozen studies in making its new guidelines. One observational study compared Jewish children in the United Kingdom with those in Israel, where the peanut-allergy rate is low. The 2008 study of more than 5,000 children in each country in the Journal of Allergy Clinical Immunology found the rate of peanut allergies among the U.K. children was 10 times that of those in Israel. Gideon Lack,
a professor of paediatric allergy at King's College London, said the researchers followed up with surveys given to the parents of about 100 infants hundred in each country. They found that popular snacks with peanuts were given to Israeli babies often before they were 6 months of age, whereas the majority of babies in the United Kingdom didn't taste peanut products until after the age of 1. Dr. Lack is in the midst of the much-anticipated, randomized controlled trial in the U.K., which is following 640 children with a high risk of allergy—determined by eczema—from infancy to the age of 5. Half of the children are consuming at least 24 grams of peanuts three times a week, while the others have none. About two-thirds of the children are now 5 and receiving peanut-allergy testing. Preliminary results are expected next year. Some experts are critical of the observational studies cited in the recommendations. "The evidence that has come up is of great interest but it's all either anecdotal or epidemiological and not the intervention studies that are going on right now that will lead to answers in the next three years," said Robert Wood,
director of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr. Wood said he tells parent they don't need to feel pressured to do an early introduction. "You can do whatever you want because we're not sure what makes a difference," he said. Enlarge Image
One observational study cited by a new report found that the rate of peanut allergies in Jewish children in the United Kingdom was 10 times higher than in Jewish children in Israel, where babies are often given peanut snacks before6months of age.
Getty Images When food allergies first started becoming more common in the 1990s, the prevailing thought among experts was that delaying introduction of such foods would reduce the prevalence of food allergies. "As these guidelines were implemented we've seen a paradoxical increase in foods allergies in young children, especially with peanut allergies," said Anna Nowak-Wegrzyn,
associate professor of pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. The new recommendations from the AAAAI committee say an allergist should be consulted in cases when an infant has eczema that is difficult to control, or an existing food allergy. For children who have a sibling with a peanut allergy—and have a 7% greater risk of a peanut allergy—parents may request an evaluation but the risks of introducing peanut at home in infancy are low, the recommendations noted. Debby Beerman,
a Chicago-area mom, has two boys, ages 4 and 3, with a number of allergies.
