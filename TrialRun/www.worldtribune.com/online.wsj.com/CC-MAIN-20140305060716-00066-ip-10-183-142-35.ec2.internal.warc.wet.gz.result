 The cost to insure Argentina's sovereign debt against default rose Tuesday as markets digested the country's plans to let investors swap foreign-law bonds for new debt. The bond swap plans, announced by President Cristina Kirchner Monday, come as the government deals with the fallout from a U.S court decision last week that ordered Argentina to pay a group of so-called holdout bondholders 100% of the roughly $1.33 billion they are owed in principal and accrued interest. But market reaction reflected uncertainty about how Argentina would actually execute the plan. "It's not enough to announce the intention. We need a proposal that explains how this works," said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America research at Jefferies. "Until we have those details, we're going to trade on that execution risk." The cost to insure Argentina's sovereign debt against default rose to $2.667 million per year for five years to protect $10 million of debt, from $2.475 million per year late Monday, according to data provider Markit.

 Argentina's dollar bonds weakened and its debt insurance costs rose Tuesday, as markets digested the country's plans to let investors swap foreign-law bonds for new debt. The bond-swap plans, announced by President Cristina Kirchner Monday, come as the government deals with the fallout from a U.S court decision last week that ordered Argentina to pay a group of so-called holdout bondholders 100% of the roughly $1.33 billion they are owed in principal and accrued interest. But market reaction reflected uncertainty about how Argentina would actually execute the plan. The cost to insure Argentina's sovereign debt against default rose to $2.667 million per year for five years to protect $10 million of debt, from $2.475 million per year late Monday, according to data provider Markit. "It's not enough to announce the intention. We need a proposal that explains how this works," said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America research at Jefferies. "Until we have those details, we're going to trade on that execution risk." Argentina's 2017 global dollar bond slid to 78.25 cents on the dollar from 81 cents the previous session, according to Markit. The bond currently yields 16.771%. The country's 2033 global bond slumped to trade at 59 cents on the dollar from 60.99 late Monday. Its yield rose to 15.238%, according to Markit. Write to Erin McCarthy at erin.mccarthy@wsj.com Email

El pacto fiscal en EE.UU. provoca desencanto en el empresariado

Por DAMIAN PALETTA, JAMES R. HAGERTY y SUDEEP REDDY AP
Algunos líderes empresariales se sienten aliviados de que los legisladores estadounidenses llegaran finalmente a un acuerdo para eludir la mayor parte del abismo fiscal, pero también lamentan la pérdida de una oportunidad para negociar un paquete que redujera el déficit fiscal de una manera más drástica. Los empresarios se alegraron de que el Congreso aprobara el martes un proyecto de ley para evitar la combinación de aumentos de impuestos y recortes de gastos que probablemente hubiera provocado una recesión. Varios también dieron la bienvenida a una serie de incentivos tributarios incluidos en la legislación. No obstante, también mostraron su frustración de que el acuerdo siente las bases para nuevas batallas fiscales en los próximos meses, como el límite del endeudamiento del gobierno y la implementación de unos US$110.000 millones en recortes de gastos diferidos.
"Ahora nos enfrentamos a otro abismo fiscal en el plazo de dos meses", sostuvo Alexander Cutler, presidente ejecutivo de Eaton Corp., fabricante de equipos eléctricos e hidráulicos cuyas ventas superan los US$20.000 millones al año. "El estilo de negociación relámpago y la falta de avances no ha hecho nada por reducir la incertidumbre, una incertidumbre que sigue afectando negativamente la inversión y el crecimiento del empleo", añadió.
David Cote, presidente ejecutivo del conglomerado Honeywell International Inc., que se desempeñó como intermediario en las negociaciones entre el Congreso y la Casa Blanca, tampoco escondió su desencanto. "No deberíamos estar felicitándonos por haber hecho un buen trabajo", puntualizó. "Todo lo que se hizo fue abordar el problema del abismo fiscal y encaminarnos hacia una debacle sobre el límite de la deuda". Añadió que el pacto alcanzado no cambia la disposición de la empresa a invertir más o contratar empleados en EE.UU. Honeywell sólo está reemplazando a uno de cada cuatro trabajadores que renuncian y eso no va a cambiar, aseveró. La decepción de los empresarios no fue compartida por los inversionistas. El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones comenzó el año con un salto de 308,41 puntos el miércoles para cerrar en 13.412,55 unidades, un alza de 2,35%. "Es bueno que se haya alcanzado un acuerdo, pero ahora viene una batalla más dura en las próximas seis a ocho semanas y cuesta pensar que el mercado no tenga muchos altibajos hasta que se resuelva el debate del techo de la deuda", dijo Richard England, gestor de portafolio de Atlanta Capital Management, que administra unos US$14.000 millones en activos. "Eso no significa que el mercado vaya a caer, pero tal vez tampoco suba mucho". Paul Wichert, vicepresidente del grupo de herramientas para máquinas de Liberty Diversified International, indicó que Washington no hizo lo suficiente para resolver los problemas de impuestos y de gastos. "La mayoría de la gente verá esto como parte de la disfunción del proceso legislativo", señaló. "Como gente de negocios, planeamos con un horizonte de tres a cinco años. Nuestros líderes políticos no pueden conseguir más que una resolución de 90 días sin más estancamiento".
La legislación aprobada el martes tuvo lugar después de que decenas de presidentes ejecutivos acudieran a Washington en los últimos dos meses, suplicando a demócratas y republicanos que alcanzaran un amplio acuerdo bipartidista para reducir el déficit mediante alzas de impuestos y recortes del gasto. Sus esfuerzos, sin embargo, fueron insuficientes y muchos ejecutivos tomaron distancia de las conversaciones a medida que se intensificaban las disputas políticas.
El acuerdo final aumentó los impuestos a los ingresos y a las inversiones de los hogares de mayores recursos y los impuestos sobre la nómina, extendió por un año las exenciones tributarias a las empresas y los beneficios de desempleo y no incluyó ningún recorte inmediato del gasto. Las exenciones impositivas para las empresas incluyen incentivos para la investigación y el desarrollo, así como para las inversiones en equipos y maquinaria. Rob Smith, presidente y propietario de Acutec Precision Machining Inc., fabricante de partes para aeronaves, turbinas de gas y otros productos, calificó la extensión de los incentivos para la inversión de capital como una "muy buena noticia" y dijo que es probable que la empresa, que cuenta con unos 320 empleados, apruebe una inversión aproximada de US$5 millones en nuevos equipos durante 2013.
Ejecutivos y economistas advirtieron, de todos modos, que el enfrentamiento que se cierne en febrero sobre el techo de la deuda podría aplazar la contratación de personal y la inversión en los próximos meses. Ello no haría sino exacerbar la frustración de las empresas con Washington tras dos años de batallas sobre la política fiscal.
Farooq Kathwari, presidente ejecutivo del fabricante y minorista de muebles Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. tildó el compromiso como "una solución de corto plazo", pero subrayó que la empresa esperará a una resolución de la próxima batalla fiscal antes de decidir si hará cambios en sus gastos de capital y sus planes de contratación.

From left to right, Prada; Max Mara; Miu Miu; Dolce & Gabbana; Lanvin; Jil Sander; Yves St Laurent I'm about to write myself out of a job, but I am not a big fan of trends. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the trend is dead. With the speed that everything is digested, copied, worn and discarded these days, what starts out as a hot new look can very quickly become a dated drag on your wardrobe and a regrettable waste of cash. Trends once lasted a whole season; now, you are lucky if they lasts six weeks. So early does the proliferation of the next season's trends start that they begin to infiltrate the trends of the last season—cannibalizing themselves and acting as spoilers for the coming shopping months. Worst of all, you are likely to see at least 10 people wearing something similar—and probably cheaper—before you even manage to get it out of the wardrobe. That's the thing about trends today, they really are just passing through. But they are also the bread and butter of the fashion world, the oil that lubricates the wheels of the style juggernaut and the manna upon which the frenzied media world feeds. Without trends, we would have no runway shows, no catwalk media and possibly many fewer magazines. In fact, were we being pseudointellectual about this, we might pose the question: Without trends, would fashion exist at all? The key to trends is to nod vaguely in their direction, updating your wardrobe without enslaving yourself to them (for the record, that's my view on catwalk shows and the fashion season itself, too). Take this fall's Baroque look. Were you to be able to indulge in one of the pieces of the season from Dolce & Gabbana, you would be fortunate indeed. But with the proliferation of "looky-likeys" on the market, my suggestion would be to purchase a bag from the Dolce & Gabbana collection (£2,090) or a classic piece with some Baroque detailing, such as a Dries Van Noten jacket (from £795) or a Balmain T-shirt (from £405). Enlarge Image
Clockwise from top left, Oasis faux-leather trouser, £40; Superdry Field Tunic, £324.99; John Smedley 'Trinity', £135; Louis Vuitton 'Transsiberian PM' bag, £2,680; Church's 'Ketsby' boots, £390; Gucci 'Victoria' riding boots, £1,040.
The only things I haven't seen made of leather this season are knickers, and most of us know where to look for them if the need arises in any case. The only way to guarantee you will look good in leather is to pay for it. Cheap leather invariably looks like, well, cheap leather. Far better is the fun, fake pleather. If you have the money, I strongly suggest Yves St. Laurent's leather anything (I particularly like the long-sleeved tops, £3,235) or the most-shot piece of the season, Ralph Lauren's chiffon-and-leather kilt (£6,100). Otherwise, by all means channel your inner Goth with Chanel's waterproof eye pencil, but keep your leather pieces small and chic or subtly worn underneath something else. The trend for leather or suede leggings is a good one because you can wear those under a long shirt, jacket or sweater and suggest rather than reveal all. It doesn't matter what your size, a bit of kink never goes amiss, particularly if it is suggestive or a teensy bit subversive. Leather pants or leggings are best from Asos (skinny leather trousers, £100), Michael Michael Kors (£430) and Oasis (faux-leather trouser, £40). Fake leather generally loves a washing machine, which makes it even more attractive (though don't hold me to this). Alternatively, you could always look to your feet and simply spend your money on the best leather boots out there: Givenchy's over-the-knee wedges (£1,090), Haider Ackermann's lace-up boots (£1,947) or Gucci's "Victoria" riding boots (£1,040). You'll notice that lots of things that proclaim to be "back" just never went away—like military, for example. There's nothing better than a brass buckle, an embroidered epaulette or some shiny buttons to sharpen up an outfit. Don't overdo it; military is always best in the form of a coat or a jacket. If you can find one of Burberry's chiffon-edged military peacoats from two years ago, don't purchase it online because I want it—and I wish I'd bought it at the time. Otherwise, see coats from Max Mara (£1,200) and McQ (£1,590). The best jacket of the season is Superdry's Field Tunic (£324.99) in green or gray. The best way to describe the next trend is just to be upfront about it. I notice it being called "eclectic," "dandy," "mixed metaphor" or "geometric," but let's just call it what it is: bonkers. Bonkers dressing is the ability to carry off with aplomb the mixing up of any and everything that should not go together in terms of pattern, design, color and shape. Frankly, the only people who I think can do this are either under 21 or called Lucinda Chambers, the fashion director of British Vogue. Ever since she came on the scene, Chambers has been much watched and emulated. But attempts at copying are futile. Chambers, who has worked with the Italian label Marni, is the only person I know who can wear yellow ankle socks, a tweed skirt, a checked shirt and a fur collar with funky, colored-lensed glasses and look sexy. For the best of bonkers, see Comme des Garçons, Miu Miu, Prada and Marni. “
The key to wearing the latest trends is to nod vaguely in their direction, updating your wardrobe without enslaving yourself to them.
”
I'm not going to tell you what to buy, because bonkers is a very personal thing. Bonkers can also extend to the "matchy matchy" trend that spun down the runways in the form of geometric, paisley or print-style pantsuits from Prada, Etro, Rochas and Mary Katrantzou. Why? Well, you've got to wear a top underneath the suit—and why on earth should it match? My own personal preference for bonkers would be to take one of these elements: the Miu Miu paisley skirt and checked jacket combo, Marni's fur-collared suiting or coat, Prada's embellished crop top, skirt and pant combo, and a coat or a dress from Rei Kawakubo's astonishing Comme des Garçons show. If you want to sit on the bonkers fence, so to speak—on the right side of extreme—study the Louis Vuitton show, where Marc Jacobs neatly brought together the ideas of luxury, modernity and ancient eccentricity all in one go. Please do not buy the oversized hats from this or Jacobs's own show. Peerless though both were, nothing says victim more than a big, season-limiting hat. All of which brings me neatly to volume and proportion, because the Louis Vuitton show, with its Edwardian influences, certainly had plenty of variation on that theme. It was Raf Simons, the genius former creative director of Jil Sander (now at Christian Dior), who began to play with volume and silhouette a few years ago, pushing the boundaries of what we accept as fashionable (read form-fitting). Only luminaries like Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto have played with shape and size to any level of success (by which I mean sales) in the past decade or so and gotten away with it. In the Western world, we generally like our clothes to look as though they fit; anything other than that invites unwelcome stereotyping. Then along came Simons, who raised waistlines, poufed-out skirts and generally played with proportion, making everything else seem more than a little dated. This season, entertain greater volume and wider silhouettes only with coats. Though Lanvin's Alber Elbaz has more than a nod to both in his astonishingly sexy dresses, which defy convention with their molded, body-shaping accents. And Phoebe Philo's dropped waists, baggy pants and oversized coats at Céline have been flirting with the concept of conventional shaping for a couple of seasons now. If you want to make an investment, buy a coat from Simons's last collection for Jil Sander (from £1,490). Like Tom Ford for Gucci and YSL, swan songs produce some of the best pieces. (See also Stefano Pilati, who departed YSL with a stellar fall collection.) Other trends floating around that you might want to take note of include furry stuff. It's everywhere. Still, I'm advocating just a bag—Louis Vuitton's "Transsiberian PM" handbag in goat fur (£2,680) or Massimo Dutti's leather and wool bag (£145)—or a shearling or fur collar (try Longchamp or Hockley). Feathers are making a comeback; try Gucci's sleek crepe de chine and feather skirt (£1,980) or, for a cheaper option, see Topshop's feather jacket (£95). Ankle boots, with or without heels, will update any wardrobe (and, yes, you can wear them with a skirt or a dress), Balenciaga's two-tone low-heeled boots mix purple crocodile and soft black leather (£3,250), or try Church's great-looking studded jodhpur boots (£390). As for bags, please don't buy one this season (unless you are using it to update your wardrobe); they aren't necessary. Reach into the back of your closet instead or, if you must, go for a simple pouch from American Apparel (£48), a chain-handled Givenchy bag (£790) or, better still, a Michael Michael Kors zip wallet for your phone, keys and change (£75). The best news of the season, and perhaps of the year, in sartorial terms is the return of the polo or turtleneck. Kudos again to Philo for reinventing fashion's equivalent of the wheel this time last year with her peerless white version. Covering a multitude of sins, the polo has the effect of sharpening any and every look, and rendering even the most chaotic of dressers pulled together. I have always liked merino-wool polos from John Smedley (£135) because they last, but you will find good ones almost everywhere from Marks & Spencer to Missoni. Now this is a trend worth embracing wholeheartedly. —Email Tina Gaudoin at tina.gaudoin@wsj.com or follow her on Twitter: @tinagaudoin

Updated March 15, 2012 7:24 p.m. ET
As in the 2008 presidential election—remember the chants of "Drill, baby, drill!"—rising oil and gasoline prices have become an issue in 2012. But election-year politics aside, the forces driving up prices at the pump are very different today than they were four years ago. In 2008, it was primarily the surge in oil consumption in emerging markets, disruptions, and a belief that the world was running short of oil (the so-called peak oil crisis). In 2012, the reason is mainly geopolitics. Last November, the United Nations declared that Iran was clearly developing nuclear-weapons capabilities. The West is responding with sanctions aimed at reducing Iran's ability to export oil, on which it depends for more than half of its government revenues, to get it to halt its nuclear-weapons program. Tehran has answered by conducting large naval exercises and threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes some 35% of the world's oil exports. Global oil prices and U.S. gasoline prices have both risen about 20% since mid-December. And all this is occurring in a world oil market that is already tight, tighter than it was last year, with no more than 2.5 million barrels of spare capacity. At least half a million barrels a day are currently out of the market because of disruptions in South Sudan and Yemen and civil war in Syria. A market this tight would already be susceptible to upward price pressures. But the market is operating on expectations that supplies will become even tighter as new U.S. and European sanctions against Iran take effect and the risk of military conflict increases. Put simply, the oil market is reading the front page. Given these circumstances, there's not much Washington can do in the short term to reduce prices at the pump. Indeed, the picture would look much worse were it not for the nearly 20% increase in U.S. oil output since 2008. More efficient permitting could get more U.S. oil fields up and running faster, but even then there are lead times. Moreover, new oil flows from Canada, North Dakota and elsewhere are hobbled by an outdated pipeline system. The market is clearly responding to what it sees as dangers ahead. Still, charges of speculation and price manipulation are already being resurrected from 2008. This is nothing new. As early as 1923, Sen. Robert "Fighting Bob" LaFollette, chairing highly charged Senate hearings on gasoline prices, warned that if companies were permitted "to manipulate oil prices . . . the people of this country must be prepared, before long, to pay" the unheard-of-level of at least "a dollar a gallon." As it turned out, within a few years gasoline was as low as 10 cents a gallon. Enlarge Image
Getty Images In this election year, rising oil prices will inevitably raise the question about the purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve: Is it to be used as a tool for price controls? Or is it an instrument to counteract major disruptions that threaten economic growth? The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been tapped twice in recent years in cooperation with the 28-member International Energy Agency (IEA): in 2005, in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and in 2011 during the Libyan civil war. But now our strategic reserves and the entire IEA system may be called on to cope with what they were originally established for in the 1970s—a major disruption in the Persian Gulf. Given that possibility, there should be some caution about using our strategic reserves before it is absolutely necessary. Europe's embargo is already forcing Iranian oil to be redirected and perhaps sold at a discount. Meanwhile, the stricter U.S. sanctions, which won't fully take effect until summer, will go one step further, likely reducing the volume of Iranian exports by shutting buyers of Iranian oil out of the U.S. financial system. Existing sanctions are already causing difficulties for Iran's economy, as evidenced by the collapse in the value of its currency. The new U.S. sanctions will put much more pressure on Iran and its rulers. But will they also drive up world oil prices, allowing Iran to earn the same amount of money on smaller volumes? And will higher oil prices threaten U.S. and global economic recovery? The answer depends on whether additional oil comes to market, replacing Iranian oil barrel for barrel. Saudi Arabia has its own version of a strategic petroleum reserve, in the form of spare production capacity, which could make up for most if not all Iranian exports. But this would leave the global oil supply with little or no spare capacity and thus unable to cope with any other disruptions. That would certainly make the oil market nervous. New petroleum supplies could come into the market over the year from a variety of sources—from Iraq and Angola to Libya and Colombia. And notably, 300,000 barrels per day or more from the United States—primarily from North Dakota and Texas and from a rebound in off-shore production. The other offset could come from reductions in demand. U.S. gasoline consumption so far this year is down over last year. China's new economic growth target of 7.5%—down significantly from the 10% or so of recent years—would mean lower growth in its petroleum consumption. Of course, a rebound in global economic growth would increase demand, not only in China but in the U.S., Japan and Europe. Events are moving into uncharted waters in the Persian Gulf. In the face of intensifying economic pressure, Iran will have to decide whether to proceed on its current course or find a way to assure the international community that it will stop short of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, with so many ships trawling the crowded waters of the Gulf, there is always the risk of an "accident" or "collision" with unintended consequences. How all this plays out will be registered in global oil prices. And it will be no less clearly calibrated in the gauge at your local gasoline pump. Mr. Yergin is chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of "The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World" (Penguin, 2011). Email

ASHLAND, Ky.—U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie
lives off the electrical grid in a solar-powered home on a 1,200-acre farm in the Appalachian foothills. The first-year congressman and engineering graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built the house from lumber he logged and milled. Enlarge Image
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, has changed the agenda in Washington with a defiant posture.
Andrew Spear for The Wall Street Journal The Kentucky Republican also lives off the grid politically. Just a few weeks after his election, he helped spearhead an unsuccessful coup against House Speaker John Boehner
and has since voted regularly against party priorities. Rep. Massie built his solar-powered home in Kentucky and drives an electric Tesla car.
Andrew Spear for The Wall Street Journal The defiant posture of Mr. Massie and a dozen or more like-minded conservatives has changed the agenda in Washington. In a capital where partisan power is nearly evenly balanced, he and a small but committed group of new House activists have discovered that they have the ability to block not just Democrats but their own party's leaders—and they are willing to use it.

"I'm going to hang in here like a hair in a biscuit," said Mr. Massie, who has twice appeared on the TV show "Junkyard Wars," as one of the competitors who build machines from scrounged objects. "I'm digging in for the long haul. This place is worse than I thought." Republicans hold just a 17-vote majority in the House, which means such a relatively small but cohesive bloc can derail just about any measure that doesn't draw Democratic support. That already happened when Mr. Boehner was unable to bring the conservatives into line on a big farm bill, compelling unhappy Republican leaders to make wholesale changes in the legislation. Trouble also lies ahead on a proposed immigration overhaul, as well as efforts to fund the government and extend the U.S. borrowing authority this fall. Mr. Boehner has told audiences in New York and Washington not to expect much activity from the House for the rest of the year. The speaker was forced to rely on Democrats, for example, to help pass disaster relief for superstorm Sandy, the Violence Against Women Act and an extension of Bush-era tax rates for people who make less than $400,000. Mr. Massie, 42 years old, represents a potent strain of small-government conservatism. He and his colleagues, unlike some of their predecessors, didn't come to Washington content to trim government. Instead, they believe wide swaths of what government does need to be reconsidered from the ground up to deal with deficits and a potential explosion in entitlement spending, These lawmakers, who now are the front line of the tea-party movement, are unwilling to fall in line with GOP colleagues. They are, however, willing to vote against what is perceived as their own political interests, as some did in opposing farm subsidies popular back home. "There are a bunch of zombies here," Mr. Massie said in an interview, referring to lawmakers in both parties. "Most of them come here with the purest of intentions, but they just get bitten…I don't know whether to hug 'em or hit 'em with a baseball bat." The White House has concluded that this conservative bloc is so formidable that it now is, in effect, seeking to work its agenda through the Senate instead of the House. Mr. Massie is hard to pigeonhole, though he leans to the libertarian wing of the Republican Party. He drives an $80,000 Tesla electric sedan with a license plate that says, "Friends of Kentucky Coal." He wants lower taxes and less federal spending. He has sponsored or co-sponsored 61 bills, including ones to abolish the Federal Reserve and the new health-care law, as well as a measure to make legal possession of guns in a school zone. He and his wife, Rhonda, grew up in Lewis County, Ky., population 13,870. They left after high school to attend MIT, where Mr. Massie, with the help of scholarships and financial aid, earned degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as the prestigious Lemelson-MIT Student Prize, known as the Oscar for inventors. At MIT, the couple started a company in their apartment to sell a virtual-reality computer technology Mr. Massie created, using some of the 24 patents he developed. In 2003, after building the company to a 60-person team that raised $30 million from investors, the Massies sold their stake and moved back to Kentucky to raise their four children on the farm where Rhonda Massie grew up. Mr. Massie's father, a beer distributor, and his mother, a nurse, still live in Mr. Massie's childhood home, about 15 miles away in Vanceburg, Ky. Mr. Massie took a one-week course to learn how to build a timber-framed house on his farm, which he bought from his in-laws. He used a bulldozer to fell the 600 trees he used and assembled the solar electricity system himself. He later acquired 50 head of grass-fed cattle. Mr. Massie said he began reading the Lewis County Leader, a local newspaper, where he learned county officials had proposed a levy to build a government office to lure a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Mr. Massie, who estimated the levy would have cost him $100, wrote letters to the newspaper and staged a protest that drew 150 opponents. Officials later dropped the idea, and Mr. Massie was soon drawn to politics by the small-government wave that washed across the U.S. in 2010. That year he ran his first political campaign and was voted the top elected official in Lewis County. As the county's judge-executive, Mr. Massie scoured financial records and halted services he thought the county didn't need. To save money, he installed a new water tank at the county jail himself. When Mr. Massie ran for Congress in 2012, his maverick reputation had already reached Washington. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy
and other House Republicans donated more than $50,000 to Mr. Massie's top rival in the GOP primary, according to the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Massie used the donations to reinforce his portrayal of his opponent as beholden to Washington. "Once she wore the establishment hat," he said, "it was all over." He won over college student John Ramsey,
who had given $3 million of his inheritance to build a group that backs free-market, small-government conservatives in the mold of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul. The group, Liberty for All PAC, spent more than $640,000 on Mr. Massie's behalf, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks political donations. Mr. Massie won the seven-candidate GOP primary with 45% of the vote, and then beat Democrat Bill Adkins
by nearly 30 percentage points. House freshmen used to be a quiet breed. But consecutive elections have swept away older lawmakers and replaced them with newer faces, instilling younger members with a measure of power over party elders. In Washington, Mr. Massie joined a handful of freshmen who won seats despite opposition from congressional Republicans. First-year U.S. Reps. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma and Ted Yoho
of Florida both beat incumbent Republicans. It took Mr. Massie just a few weeks to run afoul of party leaders. In late December, Mr. Boehner was negotiating with President Barack Obama to avoid a combination of pending tax increases and spending cuts that was nicknamed the fiscal cliff. As talks fizzled, Mr. Boehner asked the House to approve extending tax rates for all but million-dollar earners. Mr. Massie, who was sworn in early after his predecessor resigned, opposed raising tax rates and voted to block it. Mr. McCarthy, the No. 3 Republican in the House, bounded across the House floor to scold the newcomer, Mr. Massie recalled. Mr. McCarthy then turned to Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan,
ringleader of the revolt, and said: "Jim, he doesn't even know what he's doing. He doesn't know what you're getting him into." After Mr. McCarthy left, other Republicans congratulated the freshman for standing his ground, Mr. Massie said. Mr. Boehner pulled the bill. Mr. Massie's reputation was cemented weeks later when he tried to deny Mr. Boehner's re-election as speaker. Although the plot fizzled, 12 Republicans voted for someone else or abstained, the most defections by fellow party members for a speaker since 1923. Mr. Massie and his allies are supported by a network that raises money and builds support outside the party structure. Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the Heritage Action for America use social media and direct outreach to congressional offices to fan discontent among conservative voters nationwide over legislation they oppose. "The internal forces here in Washington, D.C., don't produce the right answer," Mr. Massie said. "We need to rally people on the outside." In March, Mr. Massie and 15 other Republicans nearly upended legislation to fund the government. Some opposed the bill because it failed to cut funds for the health-care law. Others were annoyed that party leaders denied an amendment to prevent Mr. Obama from spending taxpayer money to play golf. Democrats say the infighting helps them paint the GOP as out of step with voters, while tamping enthusiasm among conservative activists. "You've got the far right worrying about the far, far right and pulling the entire party out-of-step with independents," said Steve Israel,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. GOP leaders tried to bring the agitators into the fold. They scored a victory in March by persuading Mr. Bridenstine to support a budget blueprint that Mr. Massie and nine other Republicans opposed. To win his vote, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) spent more than an hour with the freshman, trying to quell Mr. Bridenstine's concerns about increased spending. During voting, House Armed Services Chairman Buck McKeon
(R., Calif.) sat next to Mr. Bridenstine to prevent others from lobbying him against the bill. Mr. Bridenstine said the Ryan plan "was the best we could do" to stabilize the debt. Republican leaders aren't likely to try a similar effort with Mr. Massie. He told his staff to give his cellphone number only to his most fiscally conservative colleagues. Of Mr. McCarthy, the GOP majority whip, Mr. Massie said, "I run around tying shoes and Kevin runs around untying them." The rhetoric by House Republicans has cooled since party leaders put off until fall a fight over extending the U.S. borrowing limit. The controversies buffeting Mr. Obama have also galvanized Republicans, including the targeting of conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service. "The energy has dissipated some," Mr. Massie said. Party leaders "have succeeded in peeling off some members." He recently attended a session with Mr. Boehner in the speaker's Capitol office. Mr. Boehner told the group to be patient. Change, he said, takes time. Mr. Massie used the meeting to lobby Mr. Boehner on one of his favorite causes, telling the speaker to oppose legislation that would give states the authority to collect sales tax on Internet transactions. Mr. Boehner told him the bill would never reach the floor, Mr. Massie said. Representatives of retailers Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and others had piled into Mr. Massie's office in June to give him an earful about how online retailers now have a pricing advantage, according to participants in the talks. The speaker recently promised his rank-and-file he wouldn't allow a vote on an immigration bill unless a majority of his caucus supported it—a nod to Mr. Massie and others. Mr. Massie also made a concession to party leaders when he backed a revised farm bill after GOP brass, bowing to conservative pressure, stripped money for food stamps. But the Kentucky Republican and his allies were back at it last week, nearly passing a measure to defund the National Security Agency's data-collection program. Back in his district, Mr. Massie revels in his outsider status. He returns to Kentucky on weekends and during the week he stays in the basement of his aunt's house in Virginia. At a town-hall meeting this spring, he told constituents about a recent flight home from Washington. His 4th congressional district, which is heavily Republican and 92% white, favored former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the 2012 election by 29%, The congressman took his seat in the last row of the plane when a man next to him jabbed him in the ribs. "Do you realize who's on this flight," the man said, gesturing to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman,
all fellow Republicans. "I was sitting there," Mr. Massie said, "hoping he doesn't ask me what I do for a living." Email

Texan's Plans Put Wall Street on Edge
By
Patrick O'Connor
Updated March 29, 2013 11:07 a.m. ET
WASHINGTON—During Jeb Hensarling's first congressional bid, a man at a campaign stop in Athens, Texas, asked the Republican if he was "pro-business." "No," the candidate replied, drawing curious stares from local business leaders who had gathered to hear him speak, a former Hensarling aide recalled. "I'm not pro-business. I'm pro-free enterprise." Now, more than a decade later, that distinction...

Egypt Resorts to Emergency Law
Morsi Takes Risk in Imposing Hated Mubarak-Era Measure to Calm Three Cities After Deadly Riots By
Matt Bradley And Muhammad Mansour Updated Jan. 28, 2013 1:28 p.m. ET
CAIRO—Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi imposed emergency law and set a curfew in three cities where rioting against his rule killed about 50 people over the weekend, in a move that seemed poised to further inflame violent opposition to his rule. In a stern address to the nation Sunday evening, Mr. Morsi said he would impose the measures on the cities of Suez, Port Said and Ismailia for 30 days effective on Monday. He also called...

EXTRACTING THE SWEET, succulent meat from a steamed lobster's shell can make for an awkward dining situation. But after I moved from California to the East Coast more than 30 years ago, it took only a few instructional dinners at a local lobster joint to elevate me from novice to initiate. Now, I savor the entire creature confidently, in all its buttery glory. Following the simple steps here, you can, too. This is one of the rare foods that is actually more challenging to eat than it is to prepare. Steaming a lobster couldn't be simpler, and the accompaniments are just as easy to throw together, whether you're melting butter or turning out a batch of homemade mayonnaise. In a pinch, even Hellmann's—with a few goodies mixed in—provides supremely edible results. The recipe at right for melted butter infused with shallots, citrus zest and parsley pairs brilliantly with a steaming-hot lobster straight from the pot, while the curry-cilantro mayonnaise is my go-to when serving the scrumptious shellfish chilled. You can adapt both recipes with abandon: The possibilities are as wide as what your garden, farmers' market and pantry have to offer. —Gail Monaghan Steamed Lobster Total Time: 20 minutes Serves: 4 Add 1 inch of salted water to a 6- to 8-gallon stockpot with a tight-fitting lid and insert a steamer basket. Cover pot and bring water to a boil over high heat. // Place 6 live 1½-pound lobsters in steamer basket and cover pot tightly. After 7 minutes, use tongs to rearrange lobsters in pot. Replace lid and let steam 7 minutes more. Remove one lobster and break it open where the body meets the tail. Meat should be creamy white with no transparency. If not, allow lobsters to steam 2-3 minutes more. // Serve lobsters hot with small bowls of melted butter, lobster crackers and small forks. If serving cold, refrigerate until needed and serve with mayonnaise. Parsley-Citrus-Shallot Butter Total Time: 15 minutes Makes: 2½ cups Melt 4 sticks unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 2 large shallots, finely minced, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3-5 minutes. Add 3 teaspoons lemon zest and 2 teaspoons orange zest and cook, stirring, 1 minute more. Off heat, stir in ½ cup finely minced Italian parsley and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Curry-Cilantro Mayonnaise This mayonnaise will have more flavor if made a day—or at least a few hours—ahead, covered and refrigerated until ready to use. Be sure to bring all the ingredients to room temperature before preparing. Total Time: 5 minutes Makes: 1¾ cups Place 1 egg, 1 clove garlic, 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice, ¼ teaspoon salt, a few drops of Tabasco, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 1 tablespoon curry powder and ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in a food processor and process until well blended. // In a separate bowl, combine ¾ cup canola or other neutral oil and ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil. With motor running at medium-low, add oil mixture to food processor, drop by drop initially and then in a very slow stream. When mayonnaise is thick and all oil has been added, add 1 small bunch cilantro, roughly chopped, and pulse to combine. Add more lime juice, salt, pepper or curry powder to taste. Explore More

LAKE FOREST, Calif.—Jeff Pintar had buyer's remorse as he purchased 12 foreclosed homes in five Southern California counties on a single day. His regret: that he didn't buy more homes a year earlier. "Things have turned around faster than anyone anticipated," said Mr. Pintar, who first began buying properties here four years ago and now owns or manages 1,700 homes, which he rents out for between $1,000 and $3,800 a month....

Gerald Mopelong, leaving his house on a recent workday, says a third of his $1,750 monthly salary as an insurance salesman goes to repay debt.
Willem De Lange for The Wall Street Journal PRETORIA, South Africa—
Gerald Mopelong
earns 15,000 rand, about $1,750, each month as an insurance salesman. But up to a third of his salary goes to repay debts he has racked up to pay for basics like gas and food as well as relative luxuries like new clothes for his two teenage children. Mr. Mopelong says that he is "always squeezed" to cover his bills but that lenders ranging from curbside loan sharks to South Africa's biggest banks want him to borrow even more. "The more they see you can afford, the more they invite you to take," he says. A surge in personal loans, credit-card debt and overdrafts—known as "unsecured credit" because the obligations aren't backed by assets such as houses—has allowed many working-class South Africans like Mr. Mopelong to bridge their earnings and the lifestyles they aspire to have. But now regulators are sounding the alarm, and many of the country's banks are dialing back lending amid fears that Africa's largest economy is nearing a dangerous credit bubble. "Clearly a bubble is beginning to take shape, if not fully formed yet," says Annabel Bishop,
an economist at Investec Ltd.

Unsecured lending has nearly tripled in the past four years to $44 billion, or 10.5% of total credit, according to the central bank. Nearly half of consumers are at least three months behind on debt payments, says South Africa's National Credit Regulator, a consumer advocate that is charged with registering lenders. "The speed at which unsecured credit is being extended is ridiculous," says Nomsa Motshegare, the regulator's chief executive. Enlarge Image
Borrowing heavily to pay for basics and relative luxuries, Mr. Mopelong says South African lenders are a destructive lot. 'The more they see you can afford, the more they invite you to take,' he says. Here, Mr. Mopelong and his wife, Alice, in their bedroom
Willem De Lange for The Wall Street Journal With economic growth slowing and profits squeezed by ultralow interest rates, South Africa's biggest banks ramped up unsecured lending because the rates they can charge—up to 31% a year—are far higher than those for mortgages and car loans. Consumers have gorged on the new credit. Eighteen years after democratic elections ended white-minority rule, many black South Africans with steady but meager incomes feel they haven't attained the comfortable lifestyles the governing African National Congress had promised them after the end of apartheid. Rising costs of living have further fueled the demand for credit. The explosion in credit bears some parallels to the borrowing spree by U.S. consumers in the years preceding the financial crisis. Credit-card debt in the U.S. peaked in 2008 at more than $1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before falling to around $800 billion today. In South Africa, regulators say the four largest banks—FirstRand Bank Ltd., Nedbank Group Ltd.

PLC is the majority shareholder—are pulling back after ramping up unsecured loans over the past two years. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan
met in August with chief executives and board members from major banks, and his office said afterward that they agreed "banks could do more to ensure that they lend responsibly and do not contribute to household over-indebtedness." Rene van Wyk,
the registrar of banks, the industry's chief regulator, says he also has met with each major commercial lender in recent months and that he believes they have heeded his requests to step back. "If the growth in unsecured lending slows down, then we've achieved what we wanted," he says. At First National Bank, a division of FirstRand, unsecured lending rose to 5% from 3% of total lending over the past two years, says head of retail credit Hannalie Crous. Now the bank is backing away, she says, after "signs of stress" among riskier borrowers. First National Bank extends more than 80% of FirstRand's unsecured lending. Other banks—including Nedbank, Standard Bank and Absa—also are being more conservative after strong growth in unsecured lending in recent years, according to representatives from the banks.

, financial companies that specialize in unsecured lending and are the biggest in the market, say they are taking similar measures. "We're being more prudent as to how aggressively we offer credit," says Carl Fischer, Capitec's head of marketing. He says the bank is shortening the length of most loans it offers, but wouldn't specify by how much. Leon Kirkinis, African Bank's chief executive, says the lender is extending fewer, and smaller, loans. If his competitors don't follow suit over the next year, he said one of them could end up with enough bad debt to weigh on profits and spook investors. "When the music stops, there's always one less chair," Mr. Kirkinis says. Still, as many as eight lenders crowd some blocks of downtown Pretoria, vying for customers with steady paychecks, such as teachers and police officers. Microlenders offer payday advances of as little as $100. Bigger banks advertise same-day approval on loans worth tens of thousands of dollars. Many of the miners in Marikana, where police shot and killed 34 protesters in August, sparking labor unrest across the country, were so indebted that they needed the pay raises of up to 22% they received to end their strike just to take home a modest chunk of their paychecks, the National Credit Regulator says. Moody's Investors Service earlier this month cut its outlook for South Africa's banking system to negative from stable, saying that the country's dwindling economic growth will "elevate credit risks and pressure banks' asset quality and profitability." "These are destructive loans, not constructive loans," says Mr. Mopelong, the indebted insurance salesman, who is making a two-year plan to clear all his debts. "You can't move ahead when you are always paying back for the past."
