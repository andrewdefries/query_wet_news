| Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET
JOURNALNEW YORK -- Economists sharply reduced their projections of economic
growth in the second half of this year, conceding that the outlook is
distinctly less rosy than it seemed just a few weeks ago.
The consensus forecast of the 55 economists surveyed by The Wall Street
Journal Online from Aug. 6 through 9 calls for real gross domestic product
to grow at an annual rate of 3.8% in the third quarter and 4.1% in the
fourth quarter, down from consensus forecasts in late June of 4.4% and
4.2%, respectively. The revisions represented the sharpest downdraft in
economic growth expectations since just before the Iraq war.

complete data, including forecasts for GDP, inflation, unemployment, and interest
rates. Plus, how high would oil prices have to go to tip the economy back
into a recession? Survey conducted Aug 6-9.
Some economists said the pullback in their forecast reflects indications
that household spending has come under pressure as oil prices have soared
to new highs. Yesterday, oil futures in New York topped $45 a barrel for
the first time, though prices have been much higher historically when
adjusted for inflation.
(See related article.) While economists said oil prices would have to rise even higher
-- perhaps to $60 per barrel -- to seriously jeopardize the economic
recovery, they believe that rising oil prices have played an important role
in slowing consumer spending.
The lower forecasts still represent a pickup from the actual GDP growth
rate of 3.0% in the second quarter that ended in June and should be enough
to bring modest improvement to the job market. Moreover, the forecasts are
broadly in line with the outlook of Federal Reserve officials, who have
said that economic growth is likely to pick up later in the year.
"It doesn't look like the recovery is going off the rails," says Nigel
Gault, an economist at Global Insight, an economic consulting firm in
Waltham, Mass. "But we have to face the fact that we are absorbing a much
higher increase in oil prices than anybody had been looking for and we're
trying to work our way through that."
The oil-price increase has been enough to crimp consumer spending, by
putting upward pressure on prices and reducing the amount of cash
households have available to purchase products and services other than
gasoline. More than half of those surveyed said the key to reviving
spending in the second half of the year was a decline in energy prices.
"You have a consumer who already has a very low savings rate," says Mr.
Gault. "People are very stretched to start with and then you put the oil
price increase on top of that."
Those concerns were tempered slightly by reports released Thursday. The
Commerce Department said that retail sales bounced back in July and that a
decline in June was not as large as originally reported. Some economists
now believe that growth in the second quarter will be revised higher later
this month. Moreover, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. chief executive Lee Scott gave a relatively upbeatview about the outlook for consumers: "Although I am concerned about high
gasoline prices, I continue to believe that growth in employment and real
income will lessen the impact."
The survey indicated that economists still expect the Federal Reserve to
gradually raise its target for the federal-funds rate, to 2% by year end
and near 3% by June 2005, from the current level of 1.5%. The slowdown in
growth led some economists to speculate last week that the Fed might delay
the course of rate increases in the months ahead, a point that Fed
officials sought to dispel when they said Tuesday that they expected the
slowdown to be short-lived.
Economists continued to bump up their inflation forecasts. On average,
economists expect inflation, as measured by the consumer-price index, to be
up 3% in November from a year earlier. In June their forecast was 2.9% and
in December 2003 their forecast was 2%. On average, economists expect
payroll employment levels to grow by 194,000 each month through year end,
down from the May's estimate of 207,000 per month.

Fitch Puts Constellation Brands on Watch for Downgrade

   By Nathalie Tadena 
 Fitch Ratings has placed its ratings on Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ) on watch for a possible downgrade, noting that the wine and spirits maker's sweetened $4.75 billion bid to buy the U.S. assets of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo (GPMCY, GMODELO.MX) will increase its leverage. Fitch currently rates Constellation at double-B-plus, one notch into junk territory. On Thursday, Constellation unveiled a revised deal to acquire Grupo Modelo's U.S. assets to appease regulators vexed by a related Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (BUD, ABI.BT) transaction. Under the new terms of the proposed deal, Constellation agreed to pay an additional $2.9 billion to by a Modelo brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico, and buy a license to make Modelo's beers on an ongoing basis. The Department of Justice last month filed an antitrust lawsuit to block InBev's $20.1 billion bid to buy Modelo, which makes Modelo and Corona beers, as the federal government contended customers would see higher prices if the deal was approved. The Justice Department hadn't been convinced Constellation's side deal to buy Modelo's U.S. imports business would create a truly separate entity. Constellation, poised to see annual sales double if it won control of those assets, had contended the deal would give the company firm control of pricing and distribution decisions. Constellation already had a 50% stake in a U.S. imports business with Modelo, called Crown Imports, and the company last summer agreed to take over the rest of that unit. Fitch said there is good strategic rationale for the deal, given the strong cash-flow-generative ability of Crown, the growth of imported beer sales in the U.S., and the strength of the Corona brand. However, the firm said its watch for a possible downgrade reflects that Constellation's leverage will increase to a level that is high for its current rating category. On Thursday, Moody's lowered its outlook on Constellation to negative, citing the meaningful increase in leverage as a result of the revised purchase price and greater integration risk as the company takes on the role of brewer and distributor. Moody's affirmed its rating on Constellation at Ba1, in line with Fitch's rating. Shares were down 24 cents at $43.15 after hours. The stock is up 29% over the past three months.

 SHANGHAI--China's yuan fell against the U.S. dollar Tuesday for a third consecutive session after the Chinese central bank continued to guide the greenback higher through a reference rate. On the over-the-counter market, the dollar ended at CNY6.0902, up from Monday's close of CNY6.0855. It traded in a range of CNY6.0848 to CNY6.0907. The People's Bank of China set the dollar/yuan central parity rate at 6.1373, up from 6.1336 on Monday because of the dollar's strength overseas. The yuan hit a string of record highs against the dollar last week amid concerns about the U.S. government's debt. But the dollar has been recovering since Friday, when it touched an all-time low of CNY6.0802. "The latest bout of yuan appreciation is over. The market has reached consensus that the dollar is unlikely to drop below CNY6.0800 before a Communist Party meeting next month," said a Shanghai-based trader with a foreign bank. He was referring to the third plenary session of the 18th Communist Party central committee, at which the Chinese ruling party will map out its priorities for the next decade. The state-run Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday the meeting will be held between Nov. 9 and Nov. 12 in Beijing. "The recent central parity rates show that China wants to slow the yuan's rise, so banks will follow the central bank's instruction," said the trader. Despite the rebound in the U.S. unit, traders said further gains will be limited. Short-term resistance for the dollar is expected at CNY6.1000, they said. "Banks remain bullish on the yuan as the U.S. is yet to find a solution for its debt woes," said a Beijing-based trader with a local bank. Solid economic growth in China also lends support to the yuan, he added. The Shanghai-based trader said he expects the dollar/yuan pair to stay rangebound in the coming two weeks. "Investors are treading carefully. Though the dollar is recovering, we haven't seen any huge buying from corporate customers." The yuan has risen 2.3% since the start of this year. Offshore, one-year dollar/yuan nondeliverable forward contracts were at 6.1520/6.1560, up slightly from 6.1510/6.1540 late Monday, implying a 1% fall by the yuan over the next year. In the offshore yuan market in Hong Kong, where the Chinese currency floats freely, the dollar rose to CNY6.0808 late Tuesday from CNY6.0765 in the previous session.

Artemisia Gentileschi's Work Comes to Chicago
The artist's famed "Judith Slaying Holofernes" will be the centerpiece of an exhibition
By
Kyle MacMillan
Oct. 10, 2013 10:12 p.m. ET
Artemisia Gentileschi's grisly painting of Judith beheading the invading warrior Holofernes offers a still-shocking take on a biblical scene. But for some viewers, the 17th-century work represents something more—the artist's defiant, cathartic response to her own rape and a lifetime of struggles in a man's world. Five decades ago, Gentileschi's canvases lay forgotten in museum basements. But starting in the 1970s, she became...

A Just Drone War
The U.S. kills a terrorist in self-defense.
Nov. 3, 2013 6:49 p.m. ET
The car bomb that Faisal Shahzad parked in Times Square on May 1, 2010 included 250 pounds of fertilizer, three 20-gallon propane tanks and multiple triggers. The bomb misfired, but had it exploded that busy Saturday evening in New York City, dozens and perhaps hundreds of innocents could have been killed or maimed for life. The man who trained and dispatched Shahzad for that mission was killed by a U.S. drone strike on Friday along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Hakimullah Mehsud was a leader of the arm of the Taliban...

Broadcasters could soon take their grievances with online video service Aereo Inc. to the U.S. Supreme Court in an effort to settle a raging debate over streaming-video technologies that has far-reaching ramifications for the TV industry. TV broadcasters, whose petition to shut down Aereo was denied by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year, are weighing a filing to the Supreme Court ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline, people familiar with the matter say. Among several broadcasters involved in that case are...

WASHINGTON—When the U.S. Education Department set out to craft rules that would affect for-profit education companies, it drew input from a wide range of people, from executives in the business to consultants and education activists. Enlarge Image
The University of Phoenix is owned by Apollo Group.
Bloomberg News It also heard from a group less commonly involved in Washington lobbying, hedge funds. "Hello, my name is Steven Eisman,
" began an email to an Education Department official in May. "I wanted to bring to your attention many of the unsaid or unknown aspects of this industry." Mr. Eisman runs a hedge fund called FrontPoint Financial Services, whose hugely profitable 2007 bet that housing would collapse was chronicled in the book "The Big Short." In the past year, Mr. Eisman has sold short the stocks of for-profit education companies. He and some other investors betting on these stocks to fall have sought meetings with Education Department officials, and in some cases gotten a hearing. In emails and presentations, the investors have painted the for-profit industry in a highly critical light. The process of writing laws and regulations has long attracted intense lobbying from companies whose prospects are at stake. Much less common is for investors such as hedge funds to do so. But some have moved to beef up their presence in Washington, especially since the financial crisis led the government more deeply into the private sector. Enlarge Image
Hedge-fund manager Steven Eisman bet against for-profit colleges and passed his critical view of the sector on to the U.S. Education Department.
Bloomberg News Short-sellers are far from the biggest force weighing in. Among groups lobbying for tougher regulation of for-profit colleges are the National Consumer Law Center, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, the United States Student Association and U.S. PIRG, the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups. Meanwhile, lobbying by the for-profits has surged, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. But the investors' involvement has riled political players. A group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, wrote to Education Secretary Arne Duncan last week that "certain hedge fund managers had direct and sustained input into the regulatory process." In what the group called "more troubling," it said Education Department officials sought and received investors' input despite knowing their financial motives, and asked for an investigation. Two Republican senators, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Richard Burr of North Carolina, earlier asked the Education Department's inspector general to look into the propriety of the contacts with investors. "It is important to ensure that the integrity of the rule-making process has not been compromised," said a spokesman for Sen. Coburn. The IG's office is looking into the issue. Education Department officials said their exchanges with Mr. Eisman and other investors were simply part of an effort to hear all sides of the debate, adding that the investors had useful financial information. "We met with as many people as possible with relevant information—including representatives of the for-profit industry and others—as part of our efforts to protect the interest of students and taxpayers," said a spokesman for the department. "We feel very confident with the integrity of our process and how transparent and fair we were and will continue be." The department wasn't the only place where investors had input. A Senate committee sought and received testimony from Mr. Eisman last summer. Mr. Eisman has been open about his negative view of for-profit education companies. He also acknowledges communicating with U.S. Education officials about the sector, but not about how to oversee it. "No regulation was discussed in any way," he said in an interview. "I think the industry has major problems and I was trying to present them," said Mr. Eisman, whose FrontPoint firm is owned by Morgan Stanley. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Eisman is considering leaving FrontPoint; there is no indication this is related to his stance on for-profit colleges. This industry exploded in recent years, fueled by a surge in students and easy credit. Close to 90% of some institutions' revenue comes from government aid to their students, including grants and federally guaranteed "Title IV" student loans. But since the start of 2009, even as stocks in general rose, many education companies' shares have fallen. A major cause is uncertainly about future regulation. Enlarge Image
The industry also has faced other challenges. Shares of one company, Strayer Education Inc., fell 22.6% in a single day this month when it said new-student enrollment was down. ITT Educational Services Inc. also has just reported lower enrollment. Mr. Eisman won't say which stocks he shorted or whether he still holds the short positions, nor whether he made money on them. For-profit colleges have drawn lots of critics, who argue that some of them provide degrees and certificates of limited value, with their graduates (and numerous dropouts) often left facing heavy student-loan debts and scant job prospects. Supporters say that the industry provides higher-education access for many lower-income people who wouldn't otherwise have such an opportunity, and that the for-profit schools help absorb the overflow from public community colleges. More FrontPoint's Eisman Weighs Leaving Firm 1/20/11 More from Deal Journal blog The Government Accountability Office last summer reported that 15 for-profit education companies it examined had made questionable statements in marketing themselves to would-be students. The report drew fire from industry supporters. The GAO issued some corrections to it. Last week, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, chairman of the House oversight committee, wrote to the GAO requesting documents used to draft the report. The GAO says an independent review found the report to have no material flaws, though it continues to review the "internal processes that led" to the need for corrections. A move to regulate the industry kicked off a battle, starting in 2009. Last year, 90,000 comments poured in to the Education Department, which estimated that 60,000 were from letter-writing campaigns orchestrated by the industry, while 20,000 to 30,000 were from consumer groups. Investors were on the scene as well. Their efforts are revealed in large caches of documents and emails reviewed by the Journal, many of which surfaced as a result of a freedom-of-information suits filed by CREW, the Washington watchdog, and of legal action by a Florida for-profit college. One investor, a New York firm called Quilcap Corp., sent a research article to an Education Department official, the emails show. An investor for Dallas-based CPMG Inc., Antal Desai, met with different officials of the Education Department, the department's spokesman confirms. Quilcap is no longer active; Parker Quillen, who ran it, said he responded to a public request for comment by the Education Department and his comments were submitted publicly. CPMG and Mr. Desai didn't reply to messages seeking comment. CPMG got some research about for-profit education companies from a firm called Alternative Research Services. That firm's president, Robert MacArthur,
spoke against a for-profit education business at an Education Department hearing in Philadelphia in June 2009. "Do I have a motivation to predict the stocks will go lower? Yes," Mr. MacArthur says. "But...I am also a taxpayer and citizen in the U.S. When I see [high] default rates...low graduation rates and the government guaranteeing those loans, clearly the taxpayer is not being served." Mr. Eisman and an associate at FrontPoint, Matthew Leahy,
sought an audience with Education Department officials, through an email that FrontPoint's public-relations specialist, Diane Schulman,
sent in early April. "As I mentioned, Steve Eisman, Matthew Leahy and I will [be] in Washington for meetings on Friday, April 16th. Steve and Matt would love to have a chance to share some of their exhaustive research on the for-profit education industry and get your input," she wrote. The recipient, David Bergeron,
acting Education Department deputy assistant secretary for policy, planning and innovation, forwarded the note to Bob Shireman,
then deputy under secretary of education, saying, "I suggest we take this meeting." On April 19, a FrontPoint portfolio manager emailed Mr. Shireman, who had joined the meeting by phone. "Bob, Thanks for taking the time to review our slide deck on the for-profit space on Friday....We hope you found the conversation useful and insightful (Steve is a character)." Education Department officials referred questions to the department's public-affairs office. Mr. Shireman has since left the department. A series of exchanges ensued. On April 20, Mr. Eisman sent Mr. Bergeron a paper about a lawsuit that was accusing one for-profit company of practices such as inflating grades and altering attendance records to retain access to federal student aid. "For your reading pleasure," he wrote. Mr. Eisman's colleague Mr. Leahy sent Education Department officials some "new analyses that I thought you may find interesting." Mr. Eisman broadened his outreach. Through a P.R. representative he communicated with Susan Lehr,
a lobbyist for a Florida nonprofit community college who is also part of a group the Education Department assembled to advise it on the regulation of higher education. Ms. Lehr emailed a fellow activist saying she was "so excited about Steve Eiseman [sic] perhaps weighing in on our side." Mr. Eisman made his case publicly in a speech to an investment conference May 26. He likened the for-profit-college industry to subprime lending, as a sector that also grew rapidly through easy-credit loans, many made to heavily recruited low-income borrowers and many unlikely to be repaid. He described the schools as "marketing machines masquerading as universities" and predicted "a new social disaster" as tens of billions in loans eventually default, leaving taxpayers with the bill because of the federal loan guarantees. Ms. Lehr emailed a copy of his talk to an executive of Water Street Capital, a hedge fund based in Jacksonville, Fla., saying, "This is a speech given to Wall Street today that will rock the market." An official of Water Street, Gilchrist Berg,
said, "We spoke to a lot of people and we always tell people we don't want any inside information." After Ms. Lehr received a brief email from Mr. Eisman, his P.R. representative, Ms. Schulman, told her, "You are one of his peeps now!" Ms. Schulman and Ms. Lehr declined to comment. One of the proposed regulations brought up by the industry during public hearings, designed to prevent over-indebted students, suggested limiting their loans to 8% of their projected income following graduation. Mr. Eisman weighed in specifically on this. "In our opinion," he told an Education Department official in a May 28 email, "if the administration were to move substantially away from the initial combination (8% ratio and a 10-yr repayment period), then it would be better off to have no...rule at all, since a diluted version will likely result in no changes at the schools and no reduction in student's debt loads." The Education Department said its officials offered Mr. Eisman no information and made no comments on his presentations, apart from one small factual correction. Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) invited Mr. Eisman to testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Appearing there on June 24, Mr. Eisman reprised his critique of for-profit education companies. The Education Department came out with draft regulations in late July, calling for schools to disclose more about students' debt loads and better prepare them for employment. The rules were weaker than expected, and shares rose for companies that own for-profit education businesses, such as ITT Educational Services, Apollo Group Inc. (owner of the University of Phoenix) and Washington Post Co. (which owns Kaplan Inc.). A number of final regulations came out in late October, applying to all of higher education, but one important regulation still exists only in a draft version. It is known as the "gainful employment" rule, because it requires schools to show they are preparing students for the work force. To gauge this, the rule may use such measures as the rate at which loans to a school's students are being repaid. The rule holds the potential to crimp for-profit schools' revenue by excluding some programs from federal aid. The final version of this rule is expected early this year. It is still too early to tell whether the investors' input had an effect on it.

The township of Nutley, in New Jersey's Essex County, is a middle-class enclave with tree-lined streets, mom-and-pop businesses and a large stock of single-family homes. It draws its name from the 19th-century estate of the prominent Satterthwaite family—and some of its fame from two iconic residents: Annie Oakley,
and more recently, Martha Stewart,
who grew up there. If You're Browsing For A Home...

Situated about 15 miles from Manhattan and with the Garden State Parkway and Routes 3 and 21 all nearby, Nutley attracts commuters traveling into New York City or elsewhere in New Jersey. Though it lacks train service into Manhattan, some residents take New Jersey Transit trains from nearby Clifton or Montclair, and buses from Nutley travel to Midtown in about 30 minutes. Many of its houses date to the 1940s and 1950s, as GIs returning from World War II flooded into the area and nearby highways were built. Several families have been in the area for generations, brokers say, and the community of around 28,000 people is unusually close-knit. Enlarge Image
"Everybody knows everybody—I see people from grammar school," says Steve Moscara,
who co-owns Moscara Realty with his brother and his parents. Prices for single-family home prices generally start in the upper $200,000s and climb above $900,000, brokers say. The township also includes apartment buildings with cooperatives and rentals, as well as townhouse condominium complexes. The popular Cambridge Heights townhouse complex, one of few relatively recent developments, offers two-bedroom condominium houses that generally list for around $400,000. Shared amenities include a clubhouse, pool, exercise room and tennis courts. The median sale price for homes in Nutley was $355,600 in July, according to Zillow.com, compared with a median of $351,000 in the year-earlier month. Enlarge Image
Memorial Park, shown near Maple Place and Vreeland Avenue, is one of nine township parks in Nutley.
Krisanne Johnson for The Wall Street Journal "It's a soft market," Mr. Moscara says. "At one point you couldn't find anything under $400,000." Though only known as Nutley since 1902, the area has been settled for more than three centuries. It has several historic buildings, including the Vreeland Homestead, which was built in 1702 and occupied by British sympathizers during the Revolutionary War, and is now the home of the Nutley Junior Women's Club. Collections at the Nutley Museum, on Church Street, include Annie Oakley memorabilia. Franklin Avenue is the township's main drag, with locally owned shops and restaurants as well as a Starbucks and a longstanding ShopRite supermarket. The Nutley Public Library, high school, middle school and athletic field, where high-school sports are a draw for many residents, are all located on or near that strip. "We see a lot of young couples [who move here] because they research and see what kind town it is, how easy it is to get around," says Mary Ann Ucci
of Coldwell Banker Franklin Realty, who grew up in Nutley. "It's a family-oriented town where you can walk." Enlarge Image
The Nutley Little Theatre
Krisanne Johnson for The Wall Street Journal Parks: The township has more than 100 acres of open space, including nine parks, 12 baseball fields, four soccer fields, tennis courts and a roller-hockey link. Yanticaw Park, a 29-acre Essex County park, runs through the township along the Third River and includes footbridges, ball fields and bocce and shuffleboard courts. The 121-acre Brookdale Park, a county park in nearby Bloomfield and Montclair, includes an interpretive trail and rose garden and hosts summer concerts. Schools: Nutley has five elementary schools for kindergarten through sixth grade; John H. Walker Middle School, for seventh- and eighth-graders; and Nutley High School. According to state data, 62.7% of fourth-graders were proficient or advanced in language arts literacy in 2009-10, compared with 73.2% the previous year; and 83.3% were proficient or advanced in math last year, compared with 80.4% the year before. Among eighth-graders in 2009-10, 90.7% were proficient or advanced in language-arts literacy, and 82.3% in math, compared with 94.6% in language arts and 93.1% in math the previous year. Enlarge Image
Shops and restaurants along Franklin Avenue in downtown Nutley
Krisanne Johnson for The Wall Street Journal At the high-school level in 2009-10, 93.6% were proficient or advanced in language-arts literacy and 81.6% in math, compared with 86.3% in language arts and 75.2% in math the previous year. The graduation rate in 2010 was 99.7%, with 73.6% of students reporting plans to attend four-year institutions.

Senate Bill Would Help Foreign-Born Entrepreneurs Stay, but It Faces Hurdles

Vauhini Vara
Nov. 22, 2012 6:37 p.m. ET
SAN FRANCISCO—A coalition of entrepreneurs, investors and advocacy groups is pressing its campaign for a special visa that would allow foreigners who launch companies to stay in the U.S. The group hopes to avoid situations like the one faced by Asaf Darash. Mr. Darash, 38 years old, who was born in Israel and raised there and in Australia, started software firm Regpack Inc. after moving to the U.S. in 2010. He entered the country on...

Updated Jan. 19, 2013 10:27 a.m. ET
Former professional cyclist Lance Armstrong told the world Thursday evening that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his seven Tour de France titles. Video courtesy of Oprah Winfrey Network.
The myth of Lance Armstrong ended at 9:02 p.m. ET, in a dramatic drumbeat of one-word answers. "Yes" to banned substances. "Yes" to EPO. "Yes" to blood doping or transfusions. Testosterone, cortisone, human growth hormone. "Yes." All seven Tour de France wins, a historic run of victories in the sport's most prestigious race? "Yes." WSJ sports columnist, Jason Gay, dissects Oprah Winfrey's interview with Lance Armstrong while chastising his cat Baxter.
More Timeline: A Giant's Fall Timeline: Decades of Doping Photos: Armstrong's Career Live Stream: The Lance Armstrong Interview It felt over before it even got started. But this myth didn't unravel in 90 high-profile television minutes. The myth of Armstrong had been eroding for years, as the truth began to close in on a once-irresistible saga. This was an attempt at a knockout, leaked and expected, but still surreal in its execution. Oprah Winfrey
was the national examiner here, and there would be no grace period of misty memories, no gradual build-up before the inquisition. She wanted to know the answers to the hard questions right away, and she wanted yes or no answers. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Finally, out loud, in public. Armstrong had been so defiant for so long—insistent that he'd never doped, never taken illegal advantage, never supplemented his performance or stamina with anything other than the astonishing heart and mind and constitution of Lance Armstrong. He denied it furiously, without blinking or equivocation, and he menaced many who suggested otherwise. Now he was surrendering, for no reason other than he had no choice. He appeared shrunken in that hotel room chair, aged, graying. The story of Armstrong had been always been so larger than life—the survivor turned champion turned cancer warrior and inspiration—and the man himself was never more vigorous than when he was cornered. Skepticism was like jet fuel, and he thrived on intimidation. But sitting before Winfrey, Armstrong didn't look like a fighter. He looked like a man who wanted to go home, to go anywhere. There was almost a hopelessness to his presence, a daze, a going-through of motions he never expected to go through. He was appealing for a forgiveness he didn't seem to think he deserved. "This is too late," he said. "It's too late for probably most people. And that is my fault." He did not break down, he did not cry, he did not offer the emotional release that has become the necessary crescendo in the modern ritual of apology and redemption. He managed a smile here and there, some scatterings of rueful laughter. His jokes were mostly gallows humor or bad. Timeline: A Giant's Fall

Associated Press After the Fall, Turning to TV After a scandal, other athletes, politicians and celebs have turned to TV. Take a look back.
View Slideshow
In 1995, British actor Hugh Grant was arrested in Los Angeles for solicitation of a prostitute. He addressed the scandal immediately and with humor, on 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.'
Eric Draper/Associated Press More photos and interactive graphics "I'm not the most believable guy in the world right now," he said at one point. He attempted some dutiful self-flagellation. When Winfrey showed a video of a young, obstinate Armstrong, he described himself as an "arrogant pr—." Winfrey was prepared for a thorough inquiry, ready from the start to get into the dense weeds of the United States Anti-Doping Agency's Reasoned Decision and hold Armstrong accountable for his history of human collateral damage. She ticked-off names of truth-tellers, individuals who had felt Armstrong's life-changing fury. Frankie and Betsy Andreu. Emma O'Reilly. Tyler Hamilton. David Walsh. Floyd Landis. Armstrong struggled here; the introduction of truthful adversaries seemed to rattle his focus, and some of his responses were grasping and awkward (his recollection of his recent call to Betsy Andreu was especially clumsy). But he acknowledged his overall ruthlessness. "It's a major flaw," he said. "It's a guy who expected to get what he wanted and control every outcome." Winfrey did not offer a lifeline. There there was no visible catharsis, no hugging it out. If there was an Oprah moment, it came when Winfrey asked Armstrong about his destructive bullying. "Were you a bully?" Winfrey asked. Armstrong sort of laughed. "Yeah, yeah," he said. "I was a bully." Winfrey: "Tell me how you were a bully." Here you expected the interview to veer off into the territory of childhood traumas and long-carried resentments, but it never really went there. Soon it was back to Usada and longtime Armstrong associate, doctor Michele Ferrari. More questions will come in Part II on Friday night. There were still flashes of resistance. Armstrong did not wish to wander into the tentacles of this story; he tried to keep the controversy to himself. He offered denials. He denied putting extreme pressure on teammate riders to dope. He denied trying to influence cycling's governing agency, the UCI. He was insistent he did not dope when he came back to the sport in 2009 and 2010. And he said something else here that was intriguing: he said he regretted returning to cycling in 2009, suggesting it had possibly set into motion the chain of events that led him to his professional humiliation, a lifetime ban from competition and the hot light of this hotel suite. And it was possible in that moment, to hear the wheels in Armstrong's brain spinning in the way they used to spin when he fought back and fought back ugly. He wasn't sure if this was totally true, but he suspected it, and he felt comfortable enough to introduce it into his version of his narrative. He had almost slipped away. "We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back," he said. And yet Lance Armstrong was sitting there, in that room, finally giving the kind of answers he never wanted to give. The narrative had run its course. So had the myth. In that chair sat only a man.

Updated March 6, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
President Obama
gave his second-term global warming agenda a lot more definition Monday with a new Environmental Protection Agency chief to replace Lisa Jackson.
Picking Gina McCarthy,
one of her top lieutenants and the architect of some of the agency's most destructive carbon rules, is a sign he intends to make good on his vow of "executive actions" if Congress doesn't pass cap and tax. Over the last four years running the EPA's air office, Ms. McCarthy has been a notably willful regulator, even for this Administration. Her promotion is another way of saying that Mr. Obama has given up getting Congress to agree to his anticarbon agenda, especially given the number of Senate Democrats from coal or oil states. The real climate fight now is over the shape of forthcoming rules that could be released as early as this summer, and a brutal under-the-table lobbying campaign is now underway. Related Video

The main target, as usual, is the U.S. power industry, which accounts for 40% of U.S. carbon emissions and about one-third of greenhouse gasses. Last year Ms. Jackson and Ms. McCarthy imposed a moratorium on new coal-fired plants, plus other rules that are forcing utilities to shut down older plants and invest billions of dollars to upgrade everything else. The agency is about to go after the leftovers. The moratorium is known as "new source performance standards," which the EPA issued because it declared carbon a dangerous pollutant under the clean-air laws of the 1970s. These standards say that all future power plants running on fossil fuels—coal or gas—must not emit more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. Even the most modern, efficient coal boiler emits 1,800 pounds, while combined cycle natural gas turbines come in barely under that threshold. To adapt what Henry Ford
said about the color of the Model T, utilities can build any plant they like as long as it runs on natural gas. This being Washington, new source standards also apply to old sources. But when the EPA issued the diktat last March, it claimed it lacked sufficient information to impose them on existing power plants and heavy manufacturers, refineries and the like. Which is to say the information it did have is that costly new rules in the middle of an election campaign were politically verboten. Now that the election is over, the EPA suddenly knows enough to proceed. Enlarge Image
Gina McCarthy
Associated Press The rule for existing sources, now under development, would work like this: Because coal and gas are combined in a single category, the EPA would cap an average rate of, say, 1,400 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour. In this hypothetical, that would allow a utility to run one coal plant and one gas plant—but the average would decline over time. As it fell, the utility would need to switch to more gas and retire coal. The standards for new plants explicitly refer to natural gas as a "system of emission reduction," when in fact it is a system of emission generation. If the EPA adopts the proposals that such green groups as the Natural Resources Defense Council are lobbying for, utilities that phase out their coal operations early would generate credits they could sell to other operators to keep their coal plants running longer. If that sounds like cap and trade—well, yes, that's the point. The White House is trying to fracture industry opposition and peel off companies that stand to profit—namely, the ones that have already switched to gas and could sell the credits to other utilities. It is also saying that carbon trading is more "flexible" than unit-by-unit command and control. This is Mr. Obama's version of Jack Benny's
old "your money or your life" routine, except without the punch line. The average rates could also vary from utility to utility or state to state, whatever is more useful for bribes or punishment. These new source performance standards for the existing electric portfolio might also be the only "executive action" that would mollify the environmental lobby if Mr. Obama does eventually approve the Keystone XL pipeline. The greens may not be able to stop the Canadians from extracting oil from the Alberta tar sands, but they would succeed in wiping out American coal-fired power. Lately Mr. Obama has been going around saying that the problem is that he's a President, not an "emperor" or "dictator," but on carbon regulation this is a distinction without much difference. Ms. McCarthy has been integral in abusing laws that were written decades ago in order to achieve climate goals that Congress has rejected, all with little or no political debate. Someone should ask her about her antidemocratic politics at her confirmation hearings.

By
Adam Entous, Colleen McCain Nelson and Siobhan Hughes May 10, 2013 8:05 p.m. ET
The White House dug in for a protracted fight with Republicans over the release of internal Obama administration emails related to last year's terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, that put a spotlight on divisions between the CIA and State Department. GOP House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday had called on the White House to release the emails, which he charged would show it had political motives for changing "talking points"...

New York Times Was Offered More Than $100 Million for Boston Globe By
Keach Hagey
