Por EVELYN M. RUSLI
Las acciones de Facebook Inc., Zynga Inc. y Groupon Inc. se hundieron tras sus accidentados debuts bursátiles. Pero los títulos de LinkedIn Corp. siguen disparados.Esto podría deberse a ejecutivos como Chris Hoyt, quien contrata personal para PepsiCo Inc. Hoyt dijo que el fabricante de bebidas ha incrementado su gasto en LinkedIn en los últimos tres años con anuncios de oportunidades de empleo, páginas para profesionales y un buscador de recursos humanos. La red social para profesionales se ha convertido en uno de las principales lugares donde PepsiCo acude en busca de candidatos.La disposición de Hoyt de elevar el gasto en LinkedIn ayuda a explicar por qué la red social de California tiene hoy un valor de más de US$18.000 millones frente a una capitalización de US$4.000 millones cuando debutó en la bolsa en medio de una racha positiva de compañías de Internet en mayo de 2011. Las capitalizaciones de mercado de Facebook, Zynga y Groupon, en cambio, han caído entre 25% y 60% desde sus salidas a bolsa. LinkedIn fue durante mucho tiempo el patito feo de las redes sociales. Los inversionistas no entendían su modelo de negocios orientado tanto al consumidor como a las empresas, que depende de captar usuarios y, al mismo tiempo, vender servicios principalmente a compañías, todo con un enfoque en el mundo poco glamouroso de las conexiones profesionales. Enlarge ImageClose
AP
A fines del año pasado, LinkedIn contaba con 202 millones de miembros en todo el mundo. Pero esos mismos factores son los que han mantenido a la empresa en el corazón de Wall Street, mientras que Facebook, Zynga y Groupon se han desinflado ante las dudas acerca de cómo abordan los antojos de consumidores caprichosos. Ahora, LinkedIn está tratando de ofrecer a las empresas, genereradoras de más de la mitad de sus ingresos anuales de US$972 millones a través de su negocio de "soluciones de talento", más razones para captar sus gastos. Para ello ensaya anuncios que ofrecen contenido como artículos o actualizaciones de estatus a los usuarios de LinkedIn. La red profesional también está ingresando en el terreno del contenido al agrupar noticias del rubro empresarial y servir como plataforma para blogs de expertos, con el objetivo de darles a los profesionales nuevas razones para pasar más tiempo en el sitio. Cuanto más activos sean sus miembros, más anuncios podrá vender y más datos podrá ofrecer para las necesidades de contratación y reclutamiento de sus clientes corporativos. LinkedIn anunció que en su trimestre más reciente las visitas a su página registraron un salto interanual de 67%, la mayor expansión de la empresa en 2012. Los datos de comScore muestran que LinkedIn tuvo entre 40 millones y 43 millones de visitantes únicos en Estados Unidos desde agosto. Entre marzo de 2010 y marzo 2011, el número de visitantes únicos a LinkedIn en América Latina creció 240%, a 5,8 millones, la mayor expansión de cualquier región. En 2012, la empresa facturó US$66 millones en ingresos provenientes de América Latina, más del doble de los US$29 millones que generó allí un año antes. En 2012, LinkedIn lanzó varios productos ligados a contenido, como una renovada página principal y un carrusel de noticias, así como una nueva plataforma de publicidad para personajes de gran influencia, como parte de sus esfuerzos por mantener a los usuarios enganchados al sitio. Algunas personas son escépticas de que LinkedIn logre convertirse en una fuente de información, lo que la deja en una competencia más directa con Facebook y Twitter Inc. Aun así, sus últimas iniciativas parecen estar dando resultados. Sus tres principales fuentes de ingresos —anuncios, soluciones de recursos humanos y suscripciones premium de usuarios— siguen creciendo rápidamente.
A fines del año pasado, LinkedIn dijo que contaba con 202 millones de miembros en todo el mundo. Del total, 22 millones son latinoamericanos, la mitad de ellos de Brasil. Colombia es el segundo mercado de mayor crecimiento después de Turquía.

Power Plants Aim to Curb Their Thirst
By
Rebecca Smith
Sept. 21, 2012 6:55 p.m. ET
The drought that parched more than 30 states this summer is forcing the power industry to rethink its heavy use of water and adopt technology to use less of it. Electricity generation is the biggest single user of water in the U.S., according to an analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey, which found that power plants account for nearly half of all water withdrawn from American rivers, lakes and seashores each day—more than 200 million...

Concerns over global economic growth and a continuing political impasse surrounding the U.S. budget left European shares struggling for direction Wednesday. The Stoxx 600 Europe index erased a small decline to finish at 286.03, eking out a gain of 0.06 point, or less than 0.1%. The benchmark posted a marginal decline Tuesday after beginning the week with a 0.4% retreat on Monday. "There's no conviction one way or the other," said Keith Bowman,
equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown in London. Lingering questions about the outlook for global growth and, closer to home, the euro zone's ability to recover from recession helped cap upside for European shares after a strong run into the new year. Among major national indexes, France's CAC-40 gained 0.3% to 3708.49 and Germany's DAX inched up 0.2% to 7691.13, but the U.K.'s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2% to 6103.98. Sentiment was undermined after the World Bank cut its 2013 outlook late Tuesday, and cautioned that U.S. budget wrangling was restraining global economic growth. The Bank now expects the global economy to expand 2.4% this year, compared with a previous forecast of 3% growth. Basic resources, whose performance is closely tied to the overall economy, suffered the biggest losses. The Stoxx 600 resources index for the sector ended down 1.3%. Solid results from J.P. Morgan

dropped 3.4% In currency markets, the euro lost ground against the dollar in early trade, falling back below the $1.33 mark. However, the common currency recovered after a European Central Bank council member played down earlier comments by Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker.
Ewald Nowotny
said he didn't expect to see a long-term upward trend in the euro's exchange rate, adding that the ECB doesn't have a target exchange rate for the euro. Earlier, Juncker had suggested that the euro's forex rate was "dangerously high." By the time of the European markets' close, the euro was trading at $1.3308 from $1.3305 late Tuesday in New York, while the dollar was at ¥88.64 from ¥88.78. Among commodities, light, sweet crude for February delivery was up 95 cents at $94.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Comex Gold for February delivery was down $3.60 at $1,680.30.

Deferred Pay Draws Fed's Scrutiny
Rules Under Consideration Would Increase Bank Disclosures, Give Investors More Data on Expenses
By
Aaron Lucchetti and Michael Rapoport Feb. 14, 2013 9:44 p.m. ET
U.S. banks and securities firms would have to step up their compensation disclosures under rules being considered by the Federal Reserve, said a person familiar with the central bank's regulatory efforts. The rules are in the formative stages and wouldn't take effect for some time.

The day we left our life in Tokyo behind, I let my boys choose our last meal in the city. The decision was easy: It had to be maguro-natto. Maguro-natto arrives unassembled, with raw tuna, fermented soybean and garnishes.
Ayumi Nakanishi for The Wall Street Journal Add a dab of wasabi
Ayumi Nakanishi for The Wall Street Journal Mix with a raw quail egg and eat
Ayumi Nakanishi for The Wall Street Journal Few people outside of Japan have heard of maguro-natto, and for good reason: It may be the slimiest, most repulsive-looking dish in Japanese cuisine. The boys didn't care. It was June 1999, and I had finished a four-year stint for the Journal in Japan. Our shipping container was on the boat to California. My wife, Karen, had gone ahead with 4-year-old Levi. Our older boys, 8 and 10, helped me close up the house we had so loved. Isaac, Luke and I sat in silence with our suitcases on the train into the city center, watching familiar scenes pass by for the last time. "Let's eat somewhere nice," I said to break the melancholy. "You guys decide where." So our last stop in town before heading toward Narita Airport was a cramped restaurant in a hallway off a subway station that, by family consensus, served the world's best maguro-natto. Sushi fans will recognize the maguro as tuna. To appreciate this dish, it is necessary to understand the natto. Charitably put, natto is fermented soybeans that have a sort of nutty flavor -- as well as a suspicious brown color, the stringiness of airplane glue and the musky odor of lightly rotted vegetable matter. Natto lovers praise the subtle complexity of taste and texture. Some Japanese consider it too vile for human consumption. The dish's other ingredients add variations in flavor and sliminess: the cubed raw maguro; a raw quail egg; radish sprouts; a dab of wasabi. As with much in Japan, eating maguro-natto begins with a ritual. The boys knew it well: In the maguro bowl, they scrambled up the raw quail egg, added soy sauce and vigorously mixed in the natto and wasabi with chopsticks. They dumped the resulting glop over large bowls of rice. Lifting the bowls, they shoveled the mix into their mouths, occasionally twirling their chopsticks to catch the strings of slime in mid-air before it could stick to their faces. I watched and wondered: How did these American kids come to love some of Japan's most revolting food? At sushi shops, they went for the clammiest fish eggs. On long-distance trains, they ate dried squid that smelled like a dirty goldfish tank. Sea slugs, eels, raw horse meat? Not a problem. "You probably didn't explain how gross it was when you introduced it to me," said Isaac, now 17, when I asked him why he likes such strange Japanese fare. "I can't even remember when I first ate any of that stuff," says Luke, now 19. The Tsukiji Market in central Tokyo is one of the largest fish markets in the world, selling some 2,000 tons of seafood every day. WSJ's Kelsey Hubbard reports.
I can remember when I first did. I grew up on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, where my parents were Mennonite missionaries from the 1960s to the 1990s. Mom's cooking introduced occasional oddities like whale (one of the cheapest proteins available at the time). Dad, a connoisseur of Limburger cheese back in the U.S., introduced us to Japan's moral equivalents -- various stinky dried-fish products. Outside the home, I discovered other delightfully disgusting foods. My first taste of raw squid came as a treat from a Japanese pastor. When I was 6, a neighborhood friend fed me what he said was cooked snake. Another turned me on to preserved grasshoppers. I discovered my favorite slimy Japanese delicacy on a rock in the Sea of Japan, on a July afternoon when I was about 13 and my family was camping on a Hokkaido beach. I'd been snorkeling and had climbed up on a boulder close to the shoreline. A group of older Japanese boys clambered up with bags of live spiny sea urchins they'd picked up by hand, gingerly, while diving. Using their diving knives, they showed me how to crack open the urchins, scoop out the yellow insides and slurp them up off the knife. The innards of the urchin -- uni in Japanese -- were like nothing I'd tasted before: buttery smooth, like custard with an indescribable primordial sort of flavor, slightly briny from the seawater dribbling down the blade. We spent the afternoon diving, picking up urchins and sitting on the sunny boulders eating uni as fresh as can be got. When I eat it today, mainly in sushi shops, that is still what floats into my mind: The taste of uni is the taste and smell and feel of the Hokkaido ocean in July. It took a while to reconcile myself with uni eaten any other way -- even on sushi rice. Only as an adult did I learn that some restaurant chefs have come up with other ways to prepare sea urchin, such as on pasta. And it was even later that I learned what part of the urchin I was eating: the gonads. I recently pointed out to Luke that one of his favorite sushi ingredients is urchin bollocks. Revolting? "No. The reproductive organs of a sea urchin are completely different from the reproductive organs of a mammal," he said, looking insulted. RecipeFor those uninitiated in the joys of sea urchin, or uni, a pasta with butter, garlic and parsley is a good place to start. This recipe, from Lily Bistro in Rockland, Maine, uses East Coast sea urchin, available in winter. East Coast uni has a more floral flavor than year-round West Coast uni, which can cost up to three times as much, says Sean Cunningham, head of sales at Pierless Fish, a Brooklyn, N.Y., restaurant supplier. -- Katy McLaughlin

Scrape almond mixture into a small bowl, add the butter, nutmeg and a pinch of salt and pepper; mix until well combined. Adjust seasonings. Set aside 2 tablespoons; reserve the rest for another use. For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and drop in the pasta. Cook until al dente, about 9 minutes. A few minutes before the pasta is ready, put the olive oil and garlic into a large saut&eacute; pan and gently cook over medium heat until the garlic slices turn golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss in capers and pepper flakes, and remove from heat until pasta is ready. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water. Add pasta to the saut&eacute; pan with the sea urchin and 2 tablespoons of the garlic butter; toss until well combined. If the pasta is too dry, add some of the reserved water. Adjust seasonings. Divide pasta between 4 bowls or plates and serve hot. * Look for uni at a Japanese or other Asian market, or ask your local fish store if it can special-order it. Uni can be mail-ordered from Browne Trading Co. in Portland, Maine (1-800-944-7848); a 4-ounce tray of uni is $25.
