NetApp Third-Quarter Net Up 32% on Software, Services Segments

   By Ben Fox Rubin 
 NetApp Inc.'s (NTAP) fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped 32% as the data-storage firm's smaller software and services segments made up for a slight decline in product sales. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company forecast adjusted earnings of 65 cents to 70 cents a share and revenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters most recently expected 65 cents and $1.75 billion, respectively. NetApp, which stores and manages clients' information, had been reporting sharply lower earnings since August as some customers--particularly defense and financial-services companies--avoided spending on data centers. Uncertainty in Europe also hurt the company's ability to predict future sales, executives had said. For the quarter ended Jan. 25, the company reported earnings of $158.1 million, or 43 cents a share, up from $119.6 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, per-share earnings were up at 67 cents from 58 cents. Revenue improved 4.1% to $1.63 billion. The company in November forecast adjusted earnings of 53 cents to 58 cents a share on revenue of $1.58 billion to $1.68 billion. Gross margin widened to 59.2% from 58%, though input costs grew 1.2%. Product sales, which make up the bulk of revenue, slipped 0.2%. Software revenue rose 12%, and service revenue grew 14%. Shares closed Wednesday at $35.82 and were up 0.8% after hours. As of the close, the stock was up 36% over the past three months, buoyed in part by November's better-than-feared fiscal second-quarter results. Write to Ben Fox Rubin at ben.rubin@dowjones.com Email

The Board of Directors has appointed Marco Settembri, currently Head of Nestlé Purina PetCare Europe, to succeed John Harris on the Executive Board as Executive Vice President in charge of Nestlé Waters, effective 1 December 2013. Marco Settembri, an Italian citizen, joined Nestlé Italiana in 1987 and was appointed Managing Director of Sanpellegrino in 2004. In this capacity, he contributed significantly to the successful consolidation of Nestlé Waters activities in Italy and the development of a strong export stream of iconic Italian brands. In 2006, Marco Settembri was appointed Market Head in Italy in addition to his responsibility as Managing Director of Nestlé Waters Italy. In 2007 he was appointed CEO of Nestlé Purina PetCare Europe and, under his leadership, pet care became one of Nestlé's largest and most profitable businesses in Europe. Paul Bulcke, Nestlé CEO: "Over the last 39 years, John Harris has made a strong contribution to the success of the company. He successfully led the worldwide expansion of our water business and, in particular, our Perrier and S.Pellegrino international brands. John was also instrumental in further developing Nestlé Pure Life as the world's leading bottled water brand. I am confident that Marco Settembri, with his successful track record as well as his strong leadership and management style, will take Nestlé Waters to new levels of achievement."

RIO DE JANEIRO—A gruesome video purporting to show decapitated inmates in a Brazilian prison drew attention to the lawlessness at the nation's correctional facilities. Local daily Folha de S. Paulo on Tuesday published on its website a video it said was recorded on Dec. 17 by inmates at the Pedrinhas prison complex in the northern Brazilian state of Maranhão. The newspaper said a union representing employees of the state...

Dec. 18, 2013 5:26 p.m. ET
Neil Davies Brooklyn, N.Y. Randy Weston folded his 6-foot-7 frame atop a piano bench. He played softly chiming upper-register figures, a startling rumble of low notes, and then settled into the gentle sway of a signature composition, "The Healers." Tenor saxophonist Billy Harper sat in a chair near the piano listening intently for a few minutes, and then rose to sound the song's theme in sweet long tones. Soon Mr. Harper was releasing graceful ribbons of improvisation and trading urgent phrases with Mr. Weston. And so it went, Mr. Harper sitting and rising, listening and playing as invited by Mr. Weston's music. Rarely did their shared gaze break. At Manhattan's Iridium jazz club in late November, the feeling was less of a jazz set and more like simply time spent by close friends who suffer no conversational gaps. Messrs. Weston and Harper were celebrating the release of a duo CD, "The Roots of the Blues" (Sunnyside). They were also extending a relationship now in its fifth decade. That bond began in 1972, with Mr. Harper on the bill for a festival Mr. Weston produced in Tangier, Morocco, during a seven-year stretch when the pianist lived there. The two recorded together the following year on "Tanjah," the first of several Weston sessions for which Mr. Harper was a key player. Mr. Weston's very first recording, for Riverside Records in 1954, "Randy Weston Plays Cole Porter in a Modern Mood," was also a duo, with bassist Sam Gill.
Producer Orrin Keepnews
wanted a solo-piano session, Mr. Weston explained at his Brooklyn home. "But I didn't have enough confidence in my playing for that," he said. "I wanted a trio date. So we compromised." It's hard to imagine such self-doubt from Mr. Weston, who was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2001. "Well, I grew up surrounded by all the heavy cats," he said, "from Errol Garner
and Art Tatum
to Duke and Monk. I had to wait my turn." Mr. Weston's music has always balanced languid and propulsive rhythms, delicate lyricism with crashing power. At 87, he's lost neither tenderness nor force. His compositions are mostly blues-based incantations, alluring for their accessible themes and distinctive for dissonant tone clusters reminiscent of Thelonious Monk, perhaps Mr. Weston's closest hero. Always, there's a reverent sense. (Mr. Harper, now 70, who grew up singing in churches in Houston, proves an ideal partner.) In conversation as in performance, Mr. Weston's easygoing manner sometimes masks his intense focus, which is mostly directed toward forebears and usually related to the borough he's nearly always called home, Brooklyn, and the continent he's consistently mined for ancestral roots, Africa. Mr. Weston didn't travel far to hear jazz masters. "Back then, Brooklyn was a jazz city," he said. "Musicians were local heroes. Once bebop hit, you could hear shoeshine guys whistling Charlie Parker
melodies while they worked." He spent time at the nearby homes of pianist Eubie Blake
and drummer Max Roach.
The musicians who frequented the luncheonette his father, Frank Edward Weston, owned in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section included Roach, Miles Davis
and Sonny Rollins.
Frank Edward Weston was terrific cook and a solid businessman. In 1946, he opened another restaurant in a house he'd bought in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill section. "You'd see him at the counter right over there," Mr. Weston said with a wave of his hand in what is now his ground-floor studio. In addition to his present home, Mr. Weston inherited a lifelong path of discovery. "My father always stressed that I was an African born in America, that I needed to study the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Ethiopia," he said. "This was a revolutionary identification to make at the time." Africa sometimes came to him in unexpected ways. When he first heard Monk, "I didn't get him," he said. Yet after listening to some North African music, he spent time "trying to find these notes between the notes on the piano." Monk had already found them, he later realized. In 1950, after Mr. Weston's neighborhood had been "seized by the scourge of heroin," a friend persuaded him to spend a summer in the Berkshires. At a club called the Music Inn, he met jazz critic Marshall Stearns.
"He was talking about the African basis for American jazz—an alternative to the up-the-river-from-New-Orleans story, which left Africa out of the picture," Mr. Weston said. "I'd never heard it discussed that way before, though I'd sensed that truth." He returned to the Berkshires each summer for a decade, a period acknowledged on his recent CD through the soulful "Berkshire Blues" and in the playful melody, spiked with dissonance, of "Congolese Children Song," inspired by field recordings Stearns played for him. Mr. Weston made his first trip to Africa as a performer in 1961, and became entranced. He was especially struck by the music of the Gnawa, Moroccan Sufi musicians descended from black slaves, whose three-stringed guimbri reminded him of Jimmy Blanton,
the bassist who lent a fresh sound to Duke Ellington's
orchestra. "When I heard the Gnawa," he said, "I realized that Blanton was actually doing something very old." Mr. Weston's music has never stood still. Yet it isn't bent on innovation. He prizes Mr. Harper as a partner, in part because "he can take a note and hold it right, which is a lost art these days." He likens his own musical identity to his late father's knack for combining found ingredients into a satisfying meal. He recited a list. "The black church. Chano Pozo.
John Lee Hooker.
Dizzy Gillespie. Duke. Monk. Count Basie. Traditional Gnawa music. Stir that stuff up, you get me." Mr. Blumenfeld writes about jazz for the Journal. He also blogs at blogs.artinfo.com/blunotes. Email

Denver's Miller Faces Ban of Up to Six Games Denver Broncos star linebacker Von Miller's potential suspension could be as long as six games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. The league and Miller's representatives are still in discussions over how long the suspension could be, which centers on a "diluted sample" given in a drug test. Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller
Associated Press Miller (pictured) had 18½ sacks last season, ranking third in the NFL. His six forced fumbles were also third-best in the league. At 24, he is considered among the best young defensive players in the league. A lengthy suspension could be problematic for a Broncos team that is expected to be a Super Bowl contender. —Kevin Clark MLB Reviews Beaning of Rodriguez in Boston Major League Baseball is reviewing the incident between Boston Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster and New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez on Sunday night to determine if discipline is warranted. In the second inning of the Yankees' 9-6 win at Fenway Park, Dempster plunked Rodriguez with a 92-mph fastball. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said the beaning was obviously intentional and Dempster should be suspended. Dempster denied hitting Rodriguez on purpose. —Brian Costa Klitschko Has No Plans to Retire From Boxing Reigning WBC heavyweight king Vitali Klitschko (45-2, 41 knockouts) has no intention of retiring from the ring. A hand injury has prevented the 42-year-old boxer from fighting this year, but the WBC has given him until March 2014 to defend his title against Bermane Stiverne. Enlarge Image

Associated Press Meanwhile, Klitschko (pictured) has other ambitions outside of the ring. He recently declared that he will run for president of Ukraine in 2015. Klitschko, who has been involved in politics since 2005 and is a member of the Ukrainian parliament, says that the skills he developed in boxing will serve him well in the arena of presidential politics. "I am thankful to boxing because it taught me discipline and to trust myself," he said. —Gordon Marino Email

Emirates Team New Zealand photographer Chris Cameron, left, took photos of Oracle Team USA's yacht during a reconnaissance mission in May.
Stu Woo/The Wall Street Journal San Francisco The world's best spies go unnoticed. They flit through enemy territory, hidden behind disguises or under the cover of darkness while using pocket-size gadgets to gather intelligence. They never announce themselves. Chris Cameron is not the world's best spy. One bright morning this spring, he zipped up a black jacket emblazoned with the logo of his sailing team, Emirates Team New Zealand. He then grabbed an 18-inch-long camera lens, hopped onto a powerboat and announced his plan. "We're going down to Oracle,

" he said, referring to rival Oracle Team USA. The America's Cup, which begins in San Francisco July 4, isn't just sailing's most prestigious competition. It is also a showcase for the most shamelessly conspicuous spy operation in professional sports. From San Francisco's waterfront, it's impossible to miss the teams practicing on their 13-story-tall yachts—and the fleet of enemy spy vessels trailing them. Onboard the powerboats, which sport their teams' logos, are photographers with $10,000 Nikon

lenses trying to shoot pictures of something the other guys don't want them to see: a shorter sail, a lighter foil, a modified rudder. Reconnaissance in the Cup is about as old as the 162-year-old competition itself, and it's especially crucial this year because the four teams are racing largely untested, state-of-the-art yachts. The squads spy on each other to avoid missing technological breakthroughs and to learn their opponents' racing strategy. "Sometimes you get caught up in your own processes and you want to think outside the box," said Cameron, the New Zealand team photographer. "Those guys"—the competition—"are thinking completely outside the box." Espionage has already permeated this Cup. New Zealand coach Rod Davis said that in November, his team needed to test a new foil, which elevates a boat's hull above water so the boat goes faster. The problem: An Oracle spy boat was lurking outside their Auckland dock. The solution was to prepare two yachts. One had the new foil. The other didn't. Both left dock, but the sailors on the new-foil boat pretended to suffer a breakdown. The decoy sailed off and Oracle took the bait, Davis said, leaving the first yacht to test the foil. Oracle's mistake, Davis said, was not noticing that his team's best sailors were aboard the supposedly broken-down boat. "The other guys were actors," said Davis, who was on the decoy himself, "and they sold it." Davis said the ruse helped hide the new foil from Oracle for weeks. Oracle said that wasn't the case. "We actually saw what happened that day," said Jimmy Spithill,
Oracle's skipper. "We have boats all over." It's easy to see why teams spy on one another. Cup organizers set guidelines on boat design, but there's enough leeway for teams to modify boat parts, even during the middle of the weeks-long competition. Weight and aerodynamics are crucial in sailing; in a 20-minute race, slight tweaks can mean the difference between winning and losing. "It's not the sailing" that wins the Cup, said Dennis Conner, the legendary American sailor who won four Cups in the 1970s and 1980s. "It's the equipment." Espionage has long been part of the Cup, but spying ratcheted up after the 1983 competition. The Australian team arrived in Newport, R.I., with a revolutionary design for a keel, the underwater fin that stabilizes a boat, and shrouded it with a skirt while the boat was docked so other teams couldn't see it. In 1985, British police arrested a man trying to sell the U.K. team's keel design for $25,000, said Tom Ehman, then the director of a U.S. team that received the sales pitch. Cup officials banned aerial and underwater surveillance after the 1992 Cup, which featured helicopter and scuba-diver reconnaissance. While sailing teams can be friendly to the spy boats—Cameron said the Italian team once tossed him ice-cream bars—others pull pranks. In 1995, Matt Mason and five fellow grinders, the burly guys who crank the winches aboard a ship, on Team New Zealand once boarded an Australian spy boat, pinned down the lone crewman and stripped him of his gear and clothing. They returned to their own boat with booty. "We hoisted his jeans up on a halyard," said Mason, now with Oracle, proudly. In recent years, the Americans have been accused of playing dirty. In 2009, a Swiss team alleged an Oracle team member named Jean Antoine Bonnaveau illegally took photos at its base. Oracle called it "legal observation" and no charges were filed after a local-police investigation. Last November, the Italian team Luna Rossa accused Oracle of violating a rule that prohibits boats from "navigating" within 200 meters of a competing yacht for surveillance. Oracle denied wrongdoing, citing the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of "navigate," which equates navigating with moving. Oracle said its spy boats were simply parked while the Luna Rossa yacht sailed by. A Cup panel found Oracle's argument "flawed and unreasonable." It punished the team, forbidding it to practice five days this spring, a minor penalty. As for the intelligence gathered, Oracle team chief Russell Coutts isn't sure whether it actually helped. "At the end of the day, it's the team with the fastest boats and best sailors that wins," he said. Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com Email

Energy Prices Fail to Derail Growth
Economic Reports Suggest
Expansion's Pace Is Firm;
Fuel Costs Remain Concern
By
Jeff Bater and Michael S. Derby Dow Jones Newswires
Updated Aug. 19, 2005 12:01 a.m. ET
A trio of reports yesterday indicated that U.S. economic growth remains solid, though rising energy prices are a concern. New claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, but the climb was mild and the level of filings suggests strong job growth despite higher energy prices. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its business-conditions index, a gauge of the health of the mid-Atlantic region's manufacturing sector, rose strongly in August. The Conference Board's July index of leading indicators, designed to...
