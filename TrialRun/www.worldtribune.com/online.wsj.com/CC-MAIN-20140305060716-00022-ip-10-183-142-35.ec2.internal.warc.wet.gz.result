Research scientists are up to something fishy. In the race to find new medical treatments, they have turned to the striped zebrafish—tiny tropical creatures that share two-thirds of their genes with humans and can be bred to carry some of the same diseases. They are small, cheap to house and easier to care for than pesky rats or mice. But there is just one hitch with the fish. Although prized for their ability to reproduce in uncanny numbers, the scientists always need more. So rather than leave romance to chance, researchers are shoring up efforts to understand the moods and social habits of the zebrafish—thousands of which may be used in a single drug screen. Enlarge Image
Zebrafish species shares two-thirds of its genes with humans and is therefore useful in drug research and development. Pictured, a zebrafish with melanoma. Children's Hospital Boston "Many factors go into attractiveness," says Christian Lawrence, a fish biologist at Children's Hospital Boston who manages a large zebrafish facility. While some fish, including certain types of tilapia, tend to be monogamous, zebrafish aren't so cold. "They're generally promiscuous,'' Mr. Lawrence says. "But I wouldn't call them indiscriminate.'' Mr. Lawrence, who works in the lab of Leonard Zon, a doctor at Children's who studies blood diseases, is one of the inventors of a special fish tank called iSpawn. The design has a single amorous goal: getting the fish to mate. The tank has a sliding bottom insert that can be raised to create a more intimate setting—a shallow pool, where the fish prefer to spawn. Ovulation and spawning are tightly controlled by light, so early morning rendezvous are best. "They get excited, do a mating dance, and you can see it raining embryos," says Dr. Zon. The researchers have been able to collect 10,000 embryos in 10 minutes. Scientists keep trying to understand what hooks the fish. Male zebrafish, for instance, respond to a certain physical trait. "Good stripes," says David Parichy, a scientist at the University of Washington, who is using zebrafish to study developmental genetics. "That's all males really care about." Specifically, males go for fish with more pronounced markings. Fish whose stripes seem to blend into one another are less popular. Still, nature trumps taste. Once in a group, says Dr. Parichy, the male fish will "mate with whatever they can find.'' Enlarge Image
Hundreds of thousands of fish are under observation at Children's Hospital Boston.
Children's Hospital Boston But what do women want? The female fish, it seems, are more discerning. Like males, they appear to have certain fetishes. Scientists just can't crack the code. "They have very strong preferences, but not along any axis we could quantify," says Dr. Parichy. Gregory Paull, a researcher at the University of Exeter in the U.K., traveled to Bangladesh in order to study zebrafish in the wild in the hopes of learning more. There, he observed, the fish flourished in "fairly enriched environments, with lots of vegetation," he says. To improve the mood in his own tanks, he now leaves plastic plants to try to mimic the grass and flora the fish experience in nature. "A plastic plant isn't much interest to a minnow, but a zebrafish will spawn over one," says Dr. Paull. Growing interest in drug screening has helped float the current drive. Drug development is extremely expensive and treatments can take over a decade to get into the clinic. And zebrafish make excellent guinea pigs. In addition to their lascivious ways, they take up little space as they typically grow no bigger than two inches long. Unlike mice, fish also have permeable skin, and absorb drugs put in the water. "Trout is a great fish," says Dr. Parichy. "But I can't keep 30,000 of them in my fish room. I can keep 30,000 zebrafish." Last November, Pfizer and Children's Hospital Boston signed a one-year research agreement to collaborate on fish screening in muscular dystrophy. Louis Kunkel, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at the hospital, used zebrafish to test over 1,200 drugs to see which ones might restore normal muscle structure. He got seven hits, including one using the same chemical found in Viagra. "It would have taken us years to screen this many drugs in mice," says Dr. Kunkel. Zebrafish
Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston announced in December the results from an early-phase clinical trial of a drug that boosts the number of cord-blood stem cells in patients who received stem-cell transplants. The drug was found in a zebrafish screen run by Dr. Zon, who says this is the first drug to go from a zebrafish screen to human trials. Dr. Zon gives regular talks about the virtues of zebrafish. The scientists created a YouTube video to explain drug screening to the growing number of researchers interested in the approach. Another YouTube video shows the fish cavorting in the iSpawn tank as elevator music plays in the background. It might seem hard to grow attached to fish. After all, to the untrained eye, they all look alike and there are so many of them. But Dr. Zon says researchers do, in fact, develop feelings for the families of fish used in drug screens. In his lab, they've named each brood after red and white wines. When a researcher hits an important milestone, Dr. Zon buys them a bottle of the best wine their fish family is named for. At Children's Hospital one morning, Mr. Lawrence explains how tricky it is to keep 500,000 tails shaking. In the wild, the fish eat a lot of insects, including mosquito larvae. In the lab, researchers came up with a special diet to help promote egg production: brine shrimp, plankton and other delicacies. On a recent day, he gave a visitor a peek at the fish's mating rituals. Though it is already late in the morning—slightly past prime hookup time—Mr. Lawrence wasn't disappointed when he raised the barrier in the tank separating the male and female fish. Liberated, it was easy to see why there are plenty of fish in the sea.

Still Wanted: SEC Trading and Markets Chief By
Andrew Ackerman and Jenny Strasburg June 20, 2013 4:08 p.m. ET
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White is having difficulty finding an industry veteran or seasoned attorney to fill a top post overseeing trading firms and stock exchanges—a critical role for the agency given growing concerns about the speed and complexity of trading. Ms. White has approached—and been turned down by—more than half a dozen senior industry officials and attorneys about possibly heading the agency's trading and markets division, according to people familiar with the matter. The individuals...

U.K. home builders are continuing to struggle with weak demand even as their counterparts in the U.S. enjoy a housing recovery that is enabling them to ramp up production. Construction was started on 98,020 new homes in the U.K. in the year ended Sept. 30, a 9% decline from the previous year and down from a peak of 183,000 in 2006, according to U.K. government figures. That contrasts with the U.S. housing market, where consumer confidence is at its highest level in six years, and builders are putting up homes at the fastest pace in more than four years. They are encouraged by rising home-sale prices and increased demand stemming from the lowest mortgage rates in decades. Part of the difference is that the U.S. economy is stronger. In November, the U.S. added 146,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department, while the rate of unemployment dropped to 7.7%, its lowest level since December 2008. To be sure, the U.K. employment outlook also is brightening. The country added 40,000 jobs in the quarter that ended in October, according to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate fell to 7.8% from 8% in the previous quarter. But the euro-zone crisis weighs heavier on the U.K. than on the U.S. Also, the U.K. has just emerged from a double-dip recession and faces a fresh round of austerity measures in the new year. At the same time, prices are moving in different directions in U.S. and U.K. housing market. In the U.K., house prices are projected to fall between 5% and 10% in the next two years, according to Fitch Ratings, adding another disincentive for home builders. Meanwhile, prices have begun to rise in many markets in the U.S., as demand has returned and supply has tightened. So far in 2012, the rise in prices has been the fastest since 2005, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller national price index. Price increases play a big role in market psychology. "In view of the tightening supply and other improving conditions, many potential buyers who were on the fence are now motivated to move forward with a purchase in order to take advantage of today's favorable prices and interest rates," said Barry Rutenberg,
chairman of the U.S. National Association of Home Builders. There are some positive forces at work in the U.K. home-building market. Many home builders have cash on their balance sheets, and land is cheap. Also, the rate of home buying has been much slower than normal, indicating there likely is pent-up demand. More people in their twenties and thirties still live with their parents than at any time in the past two decades, according to the Office for National Statistics. But fears over job security and falling real wages mean many potential first-time homeowners are unwilling or unable to save for a mortgage deposit. Credit also remains tight in the U.K. Mortgage approvals have hovered around 40,000 to 50,000 a month for several years, compared with more than 100,000 a month before the financial crisis. "House builders have done what they can, but there's a limit to what private businesses can do to shape the market," said Steve Turner,
a spokesman for the Home Builders Federation, an industry association. "Ultimately, we need to see the banks lending more so people who can afford to service a mortgage can buy." Home builders in many areas also continue to face an arduous planning and government approval process. That may further restrict supply even if demand increases. Because of the weak market, some home builders are reluctant to buy land in anticipation of new development, a process known as land-banking. "The fact that house prices are slightly down means we're not looking to grow our land bank," said David Thomas,
finance director at U.K. home builder Barratt Developments

PLC. Land-bank reductions indicate home builders are less prepared for a surge in demand if the U.K. market starts to recover, but any uptick is some way off, Mr. Thomas added. "Improvement is going to take time," he said. "The banks have got to be looking at a stable environment before they start lending again." The differences between the U.K and U.S. markets are cultural, as well as structural, analysts say. In Britain, household debt remains high and bankruptcy is only a last resort, whereas in the U.S., many households have defaulted on repayments and started again with no debt, often in a different state. "In the U.S., the private sector has deleveraged by mortgage default," said Anil Jhangiani,
director of corporates at Fitch Ratings Ltd., which carried out a recent study on U.K. home builders. "The U.K. should follow the U.S. housing recovery given time, but both remain fragile and face significant headwinds." Write to Peter Evans at peter.evans@wsj.com Email

Higher airfares and overcrowded flights will boost your vacation bill this year, making it a good time to take the roads less traveled on summer retreats. Enlarge Image
Orlando Hoetzel "Considering the costs this year, if you go off the beaten paths you will score some good deals," says Clem Bason, president of Hotwire.com. He expects flight prices for summer travel—generally speaking, from Memorial Day to Labor Day—to jump as much as 10% over last year, double the average 5% increase travelers experienced last summer. That's partially thanks to fewer flights as carriers have pared their schedules in recent months to keep planes fully loaded. Hotel rates are trending higher by 6%, and car rentals—once a relatively stable cost—are tracking 7% higher and then some since last year, Mr. Bason says. "Right now, the car-rental industry is looking like the airlines, rolling out price increases every two weeks." As for any summer vacation, the best buys will come to those with flexible travel dates who plan ahead. Many of the deals out there now should be booked in the next two weeks and certainly before Memorial Day weekend. More Insurance Can Be Worth the Money Look Out for Cutbacks at National Parks Sure, you may be able to find last-minute bargains in July or August, but do you want to risk it? Skip the usual sightseeing monuments, natural wonders and trendy beaches and consider trips to what are called "sleeper cities," vibrant locations that aren't often thought of as vacation spots. You'll find world-class attractions, scenic walking and biking trails, recreational amenities, museums, and hot bars and clubs in cities like St. Louis, Phoenix/Scottsdale, Portland, Ore., or Savannah, Ga., for prices that are far lower than perennially pricey Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon or New York. Hotwire, which sells unsold airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars at deeply discounted prices, has a four-star hotel in downtown St. Louis for $83 a night for a June stay. Certainly, the Gateway Arch is familiar to most, but St. Louis also boasts one of the nation's leading zoos—and it's free—and an interactive children's museum called Magic House. Forest Park, once home to the 1904 World's Fair, is among the largest urban parks in the U.S. In Scottsdale—known for its ritzy hotels and restaurants, designer golf courses and art galleries—you can find a four-star hotel for $69 a night in June (when the average high temperature is a sizzling 103 degrees; low is a more hospitable 75 degrees). Once there, you can take hot-air balloon rides over the Sonoran Desert, kayak in the Verde River or tour Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural campus and winter home, Taliesin West. Expedia.com has a four-night stay at a boutique hotel in Savannah, near the City Market, the historic district and riverboat cruises, for $1,070, which includes airfare from Chicago. You can take the Old Savannah Ghost trolley tour or a dramatic walking tour around Civil War Savannah. There's also a cooking school, the 1849 homestead of Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon Low and a jaunt to the Augusta National Golf Club. Even luxury spots go on sale for those who want to splurge without paying the full ticket. Sniqueaway.com, a travel site for discounted high-end locations, has a special offer for a three-night stay in mid-May at the Hotel Monaco in Portland for $279 a night, $40 off the best rate the hotel could offer. Go to sites including Kayak.com, Priceline.com,

and Living Social for the city you're traveling to and do Internet searches of local sites for more deals. You can find deals in St. Louis, for example, at ExploreStLouis.com. If you want to travel abroad this summer, SmarterTravel.com editor Anne Banas says Latin America is the place to go. She likes Nicaragua or Ecuador for their breathtaking coastlines and landscapes. "It will most likely be cheaper to get from the U.S. to Latin America than Europe," Ms. Banas says. "The ground costs [hotels, dining, transportation] are cheaper than in Europe so you spend a lot less once you get there." Hotel room rates vary greatly throughout the region, but generally speaking, the deeper into the continent you go, the less costly it will be. Virgin Vacations has a 10-day, round-trip package from New York to Ecuador and the Amazon that includes airfare, hotels and visits to the capital city of Quito, the rain forest and the Cotopaxi National Park, starting at $1,469.
