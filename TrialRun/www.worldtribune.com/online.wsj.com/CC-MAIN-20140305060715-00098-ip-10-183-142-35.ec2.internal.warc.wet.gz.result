Are you taking too much risk with municipal bonds? Investors have poured about $24 billion so far this year into muni bonds, on pace for the most since 2009. But about 22% of that is going into riskier high-yield, or "junk," bonds—those rated below triple-B by Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's, or Baa by Moody's Investors Service. That is up from 17% of inflows as recently as 2010. Enlarge Image
The Scranton, Pa., Parking Authority missed a debt payment.
Alamy The lure: High-yield munis are yielding about 5.2%, versus the measly 2% offered by their investment-grade counterparts. Muni-bond yields are generally exempt from federal and state income taxes. So far, the strategy has paid off. The Market Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index

ETF, which tracks an index of investment-grade munis, by 6.9 percentage points. Yet some experts are alarmed by the trend and advise investors to start moving back into higher-quality municipals. They worry that the sluggish U.S. economy could put additional stress on municipal finances and that states could continue to cut funding to local governments. That could send investors rushing back into higher-quality bonds and cause the prices of the riskiest munis to plummet. Investors aren't getting enough yield to cover that risk, says Chris Mauro,
head of U.S. municipal-strategy research at RBC Capital Markets. Most bond yields have fallen recently, from munis and Treasurys to corporate bonds. A top-rated 10-year municipal bond now yields just 1.91%, down from 4.07% a decade ago. At the same time, municipalities have been refinancing their older bonds at record levels. Through the end of May, 63% of new bonds have been issued in order to pay off older ones, on pace for the highest proportion since the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association began keeping track in 1996. Those refinancings put investors in a tight spot. Say a municipality was refinancing a triple-A-rated bond an investor bought three years ago with a yield of 3.37%. To get the same yield, an investor would have to buy a lower-rated bond, such as a 15-year double-A-rated bond or a triple-B-rated bond maturing in eight years. Because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, the extra yield an investor gets from the former is falling. For example, the difference between the average yield on a triple-B-rated municipal bond in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch municipal-bond index—the low end of investment grade—and a triple-A-rated one has dropped to just 2.64 percentage points, the smallest since 2010. That narrowing has experts concerned that the rally in riskier munis may be nearing an end. "We're concerned that the cycle may be on its last legs," says Bart Mosley,
co-president of Trident Municipal Research in New York. "There's still time to take profits and move back into higher-quality bonds." There is a good chance high-yield munis are going to get riskier as the sluggish U.S. economy takes its toll on municipal finances, RBC's Mr. Mauro says. Total state gross domestic product grew at a 1.5% clip in 2011, less than half the 3.1% rate in 2010, a sign that momentum may be waning. At the same time, states are increasingly closing their budget gaps at the expense of localities. On May 22, for instance, Maryland approved a budget that shifted the cost of funding teacher pensions from the state to municipalities, saving it more than $100 million in fiscal 2013, according to Moody's. Yet the move will put additional pressure on counties in the state. Other states, including Illinois and Florida, also have looked for ways to limit the money being sent to local municipalities. "When states need to balance their budgets, they look to cut the funding heading to local governments," says Naomi Richman,
a managing director at Moody's. "Until the economy has a robust recovery, you'll see this continue." Defaults remain rare. But the battle over funding could lead to downgrades and more missed payments. Detroit came within days of default this past week because of a disagreement between the city and Michigan authorities over bailout payments—a situation that spurred Fitch to cut Detroit's rating from single-B to triple-C on June 12. On Thursday, Moody's downgraded all California "tax allocation" bonds—a riskier sector of the market—to junk status. On June 1, meanwhile, the Scranton, Pa., Parking Authority missed a payment on its debt after the city council declined to make up a shortfall. On Thursday, the council decided to make good on its guarantee, reversing the default. "These types of events are growing more important," says Matt Fabian,
managing director of research firm Municipal Market Advisors. "They're rarely priced into today's market." Investors should be especially wary of lower-rated bonds, especially those that back ancillary projects, such as dormitories, development agencies and hospitals, says Richard Ciccarone,
chief research officer at McDonnell Investment Management in Oak Brook, Ill., which manages nearly $15 billion. Instead, they should consider investing in higher-rated general-obligation bonds—those rated at least double-A—which are backed by the full taxing power of a state, city or county, and bonds issued by essential services like water and sewers, Mr. Ciccarone says. "The weak are getting weaker," he says. "This is a great time for an upgrade." Write to Ben Levisohn at ben.levisohn@wsj.com Email

Take it as a sign of their shiny new status as an Eastern Conference power player that the Nets can fumble their way through an entire half of basketball against a lesser opponent and still find a way to win, and win convincingly. Such was the case Sunday afternoon at Barclays Center, where the Nets rubbed the sleep out of their eyes in time to dismantle the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers, 98-85. It took a second-half surge by the Nets, who improved to 8-4 overall and 6-1 at home. Joe Johnson
scored a game-high 21 points as he shrugged off some early-season shooting woes, and Deron Williams finished with 15 points, 12 assists and a career-high four blocks. If the Nets were looking past Portland, it was at least understandable. The game more or less set up as an appetizer for Monday's showdown with the visiting Knicks. Sure enough, Nets coach Avery Johnson removed his starters with 90 seconds left. The preparation had begun. "I know our guys are jacked up," Johnson said. Enlarge Image
Joe Johnson, right, seems to be working out of his shooting funk.
Getty Images Things weren't so peachy against the Blazers (6-7), at least not early on. Portland found little resistance around the basket, even without center LaMarcus Aldridge, who missed the game with a stiff back. Johnson said he "visited" with his players at halftime. "I told them I refuse to go crazy or use bad language," he said, "but I was really disappointed in our defense in the first half." Williams had his own struggles, committing back-to-back turnovers late in the third quarter that led to transition buckets for Portland. Before the game, Johnson rattled off his star point guard's various maladies: bad hand, bad wrist, bad ankle, bad elbow. The list went on. His physical issues could be contributing to his trouble shooting the ball. He was 4 of 13 against the Blazers, and he has shot 33% from the field over his past six games. Williams ratcheted up his energy in the fourth quarter, and his teammates responded, limiting Portland to 15 points. Johnson said his team played with a "sense of urgency" down the stretch. He also credited the presence of forward Reggie Evans, who had another Reggie-esque stat line: 14 rebounds, two fouls, two points, 23 minutes. The league leader in rebounding efficiency, Evans said he was looking forward to Monday's game—because he looks forward to every game. "This is my 11th year in the league," Evans said. "I've played the Knicks about 100 times. This is just another game, to be honest with you. I think it's big for a lot of people on the outside, but we approach it the same as usual. If we win, we're not going to be in the middle of the court celebrating, like, 'Oh! Oh!' We're not going to be popping no Champagne or nothing like that."

Asian stocks ended mostly higher on Wednesday as comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
helped improve risk sentiment, though Tokyo shares continued to be weighed by a strong yen. Speaking at his semiannual report to Congress, Mr. Bernanke said that the central bank's bond buying program was helping the economy by keeping long-term interest rates lower. The speech was interpreted as Mr. Bernanke remaining in favor of continuing the central bank's stimulus measures. The news helped most markets in Asia rebound after they took a beating on Tuesday as inconclusive results from Italy's election revived concerns over the European debt crisis. "Asia was battered by forces from outside the region [on Tuesday]. There has been a recovery today due to signs that Bernanke will continue to inject money in the market," said Guy Stear head of research for Asia at Societe Generale

Remnants of a pressure-cooker bomb used in the Boston attack that killed three people.
FBI/Associated Press Investigators have found female DNA on at least one of the bombs used in the Boston Marathon attacks, though they haven't determined whose DNA it is or whether its presence means a woman helped the two brothers suspected in the bombings, according to U.S. officials briefed on the probe. In another development, Russian officials revealed details about contacts between the older brother and suspected Islamist radicals in the Caucasus, including Internet exchanges that led to concerns by investigators that he was trying to join up with jihadist fighters. Speaking Monday about the DNA discovery, the U.S. officials cautioned that there could be multiple explanations for why genetic material from someone other than the two bombing suspects—
Tamerlan Tsarnaev
and his younger brother, Dzhokhar
—could have been found on remnants of the exploded devices. It could have come, for example, from a store clerk who handled materials used in the bombs or a stray hair that ended up in the bomb. Monday, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents visited the Rhode Island home of the parents of Katherine Russell,
the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. He died after a shootout with police four days after the April 15 bombings. "The FBI is there as part of our ongoing investigation, but we aren't permitted to discuss specific aspects of the case," said FBI spokesman Jason Pack. Ms. Russell has been staying with her parents since the bombings, and FBI agents have been seen posted outside the house since her late husband was identified as one of the bombers. Her lawyer has said she is "doing everything she can to assist with the investigation." Enlarge Image

Dagestan Federal Security Service One official familiar with the case said agents went to the house Monday to collect a DNA sample from Ms. Russell, the culmination of days of negotiations. FBI officials also have been negotiating with Ms. Russell's attorney in recent days to gain fuller access to question her, the officials familiar with the case said. The officials said the DNA request was needed to determine whether it matched the DNA found on the bomb remnants. Ms. Russell is one of as many as a half-dozen people in whom investigators are interested as they seek to determine if the brothers had any help in the bomb attack or the days afterward, the officials said. Ms. Russell's lawyer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the latest developments. Investigators have no evidence that any of the associates of the brothers had knowledge of the bombing plot, and they believe that if anyone helped to dispose of evidence—a point that remains uncertain—it may have been unwitting, according to officials briefed on the investigation. Related Defense Lawyer Has Background Of Capital Cases Both U.S. and Russian authorities are trying to learn more about Tamerlan Tsarnaev's activities while staying in Russia from January to July of 2012. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone Monday and agreed to boost antiterror cooperation, officials on both sides said. Two Russian government officials said Tamerlan Tsarnaev exchanged notes over the Internet with William Plotnikov,
a boxer who moved with his parents from Russia to Canada before joining militants in the North Caucasus. And they said Mr. Tsarnaev met several times in early 2012 with Mansur Makhmud Nidal, an alleged militant from the Russian province of Dagestan and suspected jihadist recruiter. The meetings happened in a mosque in Dagestan's capital of Makhachkala known for its adherence to a puritanical strain of Islam, they said. The Tsarnaevs' parents have denied their sons were involved in terrorism.

Mr. Nidal died in a firefight in Makhachkala last May after a five-hour standoff that ended with him throwing a grenade at police officials, according to Russian authorities. Mr. Plotnikov died two months later, in mid-July, during a raid in the hinterland of Utamysh, a village southwest of Makhachkala. Mr. Tsarnaev was in the region at the time of both raids but left Russia for the U.S. three days after the second one. He left before picking up a Russian passport that had been prepared for him at the local migration office in Dagestan's capital. "He intended to join the fighters, but he lost his contacts," one of the Russian officials said. "In the end he picked an easier enemy in Boston." The Russian officials said it was unclear whether Mr. Tsarnaev and Mr. Plotnikov ever met in person. The parents of the two boxers say they don't recall any interaction between the two. There are no indications that the two men ever boxed together, and Russian officials haven't yet produced any of the online communication that they say exists. A U.S. official said Russian authorities haven't shared any information about Mr. Tsarnaev related to contact with any suspected militants during his trip last year to Dagestan. Several U.S. officials, however, said they believe Russia has more information about Mr. Tsarnaev that hasn't been handed over. —Paul Sonne contributed to this article.

Portugal Parties Fail to Reach Pact
President Set to Speak Sunday as Ruling Coalition Flounders
By
Patricia Kowsmann
Updated July 20, 2013 3:28 p.m. ET
LISBON—Portugal's three main parties failed to agree on a "national salvation pact" to keep the country's international bailout on track, leaving the president to announce Sunday a new solution to a three-week long political crisis. Among the options would be letting the weakened ruling coalition run the country or calling for immediate elections. Choosing the latter would come as a surprise, however, since President Aníbal Cavaco Silva warned only 10 days ago that would create instability and would most likely...

Real-estate investment trusts enjoyed their best quarter since the first three months of 2012, but the REIT sector underperformed the broader stock market as investors developed a greater appetite for risk. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which tracks 137 real-estate investment trusts, delivered a total return, including dividends, of 7.9% for the first quarter. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10.6% and 11.93%, respectively, in the quarter. Results in the REIT sector varied greatly among different asset types. Thanks to their high dividends, companies that invest mainly in commercial-mortgage loans and securities led the sector with a 22.6% return. But companies that own rental-apartment buildings sputtered. The so-called multifamily REITs, which had been the darling of the sector for several years, declined 0.03% in the first quarter.

The decline reflected investor concern that the improving single-family home market might result in lower rents and higher vacancies at apartment buildings. "The thinking has shifted from no one is going to buy a house ever again, to if people decide they want to get back into houses, this is bad for apartments," said Joel Beam,
fund manager for Forward Select Income Fund. REITs have done better than the broader stock market for most of the financial downturn, outperforming the S&P 500 for 11 of the past 16 quarters. Since the market hit bottom in 2009, REITs have returned 233%, compared with 153% for the S&P 500 index. Investors often gravitate to REITs during tough times because they typically pay higher dividends than other companies. Currently, the average REIT dividend yield is about 3.4%, according the Dow Jones REIT Index, compared with 2% for the S&P 500. But when Wall Street turns bullish, as it has in recent months, REITs often underperform the broader market. "It's because [stocks] are cheaper and the anticipation that some of the other sectors will return more in the next 12 months to 24 months than REITs," that we think the industry will lag behind, said Hessam Nadji,
a managing director at Marcus & Millichap. Nonetheless, analysts generally expect REITs to generate returns this year ranging from 12% to 15% as long as job growth continues and interest rates remain relatively low. Over the past year, most REITs have reported stronger-than-expected earnings because they have been able to raise rents and boost occupancy as the economy has improved. Since the market hit bottom in 2009, the value of property owned by REITs has gained 60% and is back to peak levels, according to an index compiled by Green Street Advisors. REITs also have benefited from a dearth of new construction in recent years and the record-low interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program, which has enabled them to raise cheap capital.

showed average monthly rents up 0.5% from the previous quarter to $1,054. But the rate of growth is tapering off. Also, investors are concerned because of the increase in supply. The country's 54 largest metro markets should see about 150,000 new units this year, followed by about 300,000 more in 2014 and 2015, said Luis Mejia, CoStar Group's director of multifamily research. The strong showing of commercial-mortgage REITs during the quarter reflected their high dividend yield of an average of 7%, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Mortgage REITs, which use short-term debt to buy longer-term mortgage securities, also are at the greatest risk if interest rates rise because that would increase their short-term borrowing costs and cut the value of the mortgage bonds that they hold, possibly resulting in losses and reduced dividends.
