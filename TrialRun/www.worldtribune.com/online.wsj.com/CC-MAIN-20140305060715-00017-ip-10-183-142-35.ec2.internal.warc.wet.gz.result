Do we need religion to have ethics? Is it possible that a world without religion can be, on the whole, a better place to live?

"So you can say that Islam hasn't evolved to the place Christianity has, but that's completely ignorant of Christian and Islamic teachings. Evolution has nothing to do with it."
Nancy,
Then why do you get moderate Muslims decrying the actions of radicals just like you decry the actions of Chrisitan militia groups or supposedly Christian white supremacy organizations. When asked they will say that these radical groups are taking the words of the prophet out of context. In Sam Harris's book, "The End of Fatih", he listed page after page of Koranic verses that sounded militaristic. For that reason, he , Bill Maher and the late Christopher Hitchens thought that Islam itself was the culprit. But what is the difference between those passages and the numerous passages in the Old Testament describing the genocidal behavior of the Hebrews toward their enemies. Had Christianity taken Marcion's advice and totally eschewed the Old Testament and its imperfect god, you would have a point. But Christianity is joined at the hip with the Old Testament and therefore must be acccountable for the numerous barbarisms described there. And centuries ago, Christians did behave barbarically in some cases making Moses or Saul blush. Over the centuries neither Christians or Muslims seem to have found a war they didn't like. It comes down to tactics.
It's like "how do you explain the difference in homicide rates betwee African Americans and Whites". It appears when you look at some of the standard measures of age and income there still is a significant gap. So does this mean African Americans are just more warlike.? Well I read a paper that the researcher was able to explain almost all of the variantion adding education, population density and drug use. There is probably somthing to the 72 Virgins that gets a suicide bomber all riled up. But if you do any research at all, you find some of these folks do it because their families are paid handsomely for their act. You see grinding poverty can distort a persons reality. I'm not disputing that there are not true believers that explain some of the difference. But good educaton would probably reduce some of the supply along with a better way of life. The Boston Bombers were probably propelled more by profound disappointment in a system that would not let them achieve their dreams and a disaffection with American society in general rather than picking up a Koran one day and deciding we are evil.

Greg,The teachings of the Christian and Muslim scriptures never change. They always mean the same thing. They don't evolve. How well men understand them and follow them may differ. After all, a thousand years ago there wasn't a book store on every corner selling Bibles or Qurans. Here's the difference between the two. Christianity teaches that God's law is supreme, but God is not enforcing his law at this time. Instead, he is offering mankind a sort of amnesty--forgiveness for his sins. The highest authority the Christian lives under on earth are earthly governments, which they are taught to obey.Paul writes: "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves." Romans 13 So Christians can adapt to a changing world since we are to obey earthly governments even though we believe God's law never changes.For the Muslim, however, God's law is supreme and there is no law that is higher right now on earth. That's why Islamic law trumps civil law always. Islamic law has been written and it does not evolve. If you change Islamic law, you destroy Islam. The question is: What about non Muslims? In my understanding some say non Muslims should be judged by their own religious beliefs. But many don't agree with separation of church and state. Some say, "These so called rights and freedoms which they call for all people to enjoy regardless of religion make the monotheist and the polytheist equally entitled to these rights and freedoms, so the slave of Allaah and the slave of the Shaytaan are placed on the same level, and every worshipper of rocks, idols or people is given the complete right and freedom to enjoy his kufr and heresy. This is contrary to the laws of Allaah in this world and the Hereafter."So there is a fundamental difference in the worldview of Christianity and Islam. Some in Islam may temper their view, but as soon as they reject Islamic law as supreme over all other law, they reject Islam. The Boston bombers saw an increasing sinfulness in America, just as Christians do. The older brother criticized the acceptance of Harry Potter and its Pagan teachings, just as Christians do. Christians, however, stop at disapproval. They are taught not to judge, but to remain subject to civil law. Muslims see Islamic law as supreme and some go so far as to see their duty as upholding justice against law breakers. At 19, I'm not sure how such a young man could have "profound disappointment in a system that would not let him achieve his dreams." He hadn't even tried to achieve much yet. Instead, he placed a destructive bomb next to an 8 year old child and blew him up. There's something more wrong there than just disappointment in not yet achieving his dreams.

"So there is a fundamental difference in the worldview of Christianity and Islam. Some in Islam may temper their view, but as soon as they reject Islamic law as supreme over all other law, they reject Islam."Nancy,Last time I checked Turkey, an Islamic Republic was a democracy. And I believe so is Indonesia. Egypt is nominally a democracy although time will tell whether it holds up. The Arabian peninsula countries tend to be monarchies, The only theocracy I can think of is iran and we have ourselves to blame for that one. The country had just elected a democratic government that we believed was hostile to our interests. So our CIA underwrote a coup and put a despot back into power. The rest tend to some sort of dictatorship and that seems to be at least partially caused by vestiges of European colonialism,. And yes the leaders of Islamic countries have to have strong Islamic bonafides, is that any different than here. Yes there are countries that have radicalized elements who actively recruit amongst the desperately poor. A madrassa that can give some poor child three squares a day can indoctrinate them with their radicalized message. In this country we have a stronger madrassa. It's called the publics school system and school lunch programs. It's these types of innovations that you forget that make the difference.

Hi Nanc,"Paul writes: "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves." Romans 13" --- Nanc, why does such a loving Christian God "institute" such radical "governing authorities" as Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao, Ayatollah Khomeini/Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Kim Jong-il, etc., all throughout history, which perpetuate ignorance & misery in the world? Aren't you & other Christians who decry & rebel against any "governing authorities" that you do not personally agree with, (cough, uh Obama, cough O:-)), also rebelling against what God has instituted? Isn't it a bit hypocritical to quote Paul here? It seems to me "Christian teaching" & "Islamic teaching" are solely in the eye of the beholder & therefore constantly changing & morphing, not much unlike a chameleon mindlessly changing color for defensive purposes. Such as the differing interpretations between all the varying religious sects within both, or between you, the Pope, Pat Robertson, Fred Phelps, etc... Ultimately, it is what one thinks it is. Which is simply a product of the clinging aspect of the abstract thinking mind born out of ignorance, no more, no less.http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdccegqpis1r4yl3go1_500.jpg"There's something more wrong there than just disappointment in not yet achieving his dreams." --- Blind faith in the certainty of delusional thinking? 8^Ohttp://www.dotheknowledge.com/images/cartoon2.jpgCheers!

Very good Nancy. There is a vast difference between the Christian and Muslim. Christianity has a tolerance that is missing in Islam.

Greg,News from Turkey, April 15, 2013:"Turkish pianist Fazil Say received a suspended 10-month jail term on Monday for mocking Islam on Twitter. Secular Turks have become increasingly concerned over what they see as the creeping Islamization of society. [...]"The Turkish opposition speaks of a dangerous tendency: nine decades after Turkey broke with the Islamic rule of the Ottoman Empire in favor of an anti-clerical, pro-Western vision, the ideas and values that were rejected appear to some to be making a comeback.“'We are very concerned because Turkey is a secular democracy. But Islam has become the only reference. It says what to do, what to wear, what to eat, what not to eat,' Faruk Logoglu, CHP party vice-chairman said." http://rt.com/news/islam-challenges-secular-turkey-861/

Sharia.Greg feigns ignorance, but I don't believe him. I think he says whatever he thinks he has to say in order to further his objective, which is to tear down Christianity in order to pump up the progressive state.Anything Goes. Strongman Wins.Ironically, the same basic philosophy as Sharia, though Sharia has the slight patina of religiosity to help push it forward.This is why progressives and Sharia-ists so often find themselves strange bedfellows. They adhere to the same collectivist first principles.

James:“Let us start with the definition of "ad hominem", here's how merriam-webster.com defines it.”Okay, I’ll concede this one, at least in part. I was trained to use the term “ad hominem” to refer only to specific arguments made, not general comments and quips about character and/or intentions, so I often forget what the internet has made of the term.Just for the purposes of seeing where I’m coming from—not to be combative—I recommend reading this when you get a chance:http://grammar.about.com/od/ab/g/adhomterm.htmTraditionally and academically, I maintain that the term is reserved exclusively for targeted counterarguments instead of generally abusive language towards someone else; however, we never established that level of specificity on the point in contention, so I won’t plead it now.

That should also serve you to realize that many of the things you say have different meanings for different people, some insulting whatever else your dictionary says and you may want to call them. Yes, I know, your favorite ploy is to say now that it applies to others, so yes, it applies to me, but with good honest people who don't run around insulting others willy-nilly I try very hard not to do so myself.

ZachYou say that you maintain that the term is reserved for targeted counterarguments.Was this not your counterargument?"As for the rest of your post, I'll have to quote Xavier and reply: Whatever. I'll let your record speak for itself; not even stepping on your own toes slows you down."Why is that, to you, not an ad hominen but this is?Jim: “Certainly long before you flunked out of high school and had to get your GED… Your education in creative writing coupled with your youthful inexperience may suffice to give you a pass on intellectual effort, but you flunk on the merits.”"That’s an ad hominem, Jim."To which I said,Well Zach your wrong, that is not an ad hominen.Jim O. is merely attacking your qualifications, not you personally, no matter how distasteful you may find his verbiage.Now I also am not looking to be combative, but if that's what it takes, that's what you get.As a great sage once noted,"I yam what I yam and that's all what I yam.Oh, and by the way, I read the link, the definition is the same.Please, if needed, show me where I am wrong.

Everett:“James has got me beat about being wrong. He's never wrong. I am in second place I suppose, for I was wrong once. It was an occasion when I decided I was wrong, but it later turned out that I was right.”Just out of curiosity, what were you wrong (right) about? :)“Zack, so what is the conclusion? Sex ed in public schools: Good, kinda good, kinda bad, bad, very bad?”The evidence I’ve seen suggests that comprehensive sex education is effective in reducing unwanted pregnancies and STDs. Since I think those two things are good things, I’m gonna go with “good”. One important thing to remember is that comprehensive sex education first presents abstinence but includes other elements of education to account for those who won’t accept the abstinence message. This approach contrasts with an abstinence-only approach, which only a small minority of studies find effective.“The only authority I see that comes even close to God's level is our government. Are we ready to turn over our moral direction to politicians that write laws? If not, then, who?”One hurdle at a time. Are you and I closed out regarding sex ed, or is there more?

I think I said b4 that a good honest presentation of the sexual side of life is what I favor. I don't buy the argument that explaining sex and what it entails is going to encourage sexual activity. However, it certainly doesn't discourage it either, but one can do only so much in trying to direct the lives of others, even children. It is a different world from the one I grew up in. BTW, when I reached puberty my parents started leaving publications titled, "Sexology" laying around the house. It was a periodical mag that presented a good view of the "facts of life" aimed at educating one about sex. They knew I was an avid reader and would read every word. My parents were advanced for the times we lived in.

Tao:“Maybe this is a limitation of human language. If God and good are one and the same, thus good has no meaning relevant to God apart from His essence, then what word do we used to describe the “goodness” that defines Him? The only argument I can think of at this time is that if “good” is simply being consistent with God’s will, as you and Everett appear to be hypothesizing, then you would have to call God good since a being is always 100% consistent with it’s own will (as far as human logic can understand).”Good point. This makes it seem as though you give credence to a more deistic paradigm; is that a fair assessment? God is good and good is God, yet God is not separate from good, so we can’t say that God “decides” what is good any more then we can say that good “decides” what is God. Agreed?

Zack,The way I heard it when I was in religion is that, God IS good, period and end of story. Thus by that view good cannot exist independent of God because its source is God. Accordingly then the answer to your question is NO if God and religion are one package, unless one is willing to accept a world that doesn't comprehend even the concept of "good". Case closed.

EverettYour point would be of more interest if you didn't speak of religion as if it were a teenage band playing in someones garage.You failed at religion, and I believe you would agree that that was no ones fault but your own.So why do you continue with the attempt to drag others into your own, self imposed damnation?Hate God, Hate religion, Hate yourself all you want, but stop trying to bring others into your fold of damnation.

I am moving this under Zach so I can be prompted. But it is meant for anyone who wants to help me clarify what all of the stuff in this thread as well as individualism mean. I've frankly lost trust in Zach, however, because he seems to be just trying to one-up someone all the time, i.e. his game is winning, not clarifying.

Actually I don't understand your point Everett. Are you referring to the question "do we need religion to have ethics?" If so, and "God IS good," and "God and religion are one package," then how can we not need religion to have ethics?But I also didn't quite get Zach's point that Tao's is more of a deistic paradigm because " God is good and good is God, yet God is not separate from good..." If God and good are one and the same, then isn't God present in the universe at all times, and if so isn't that in contradiction with a deist god that "doesn't intervene in the universe"? Maybe I don't understand deism. But then recently it was explained to me by a credible non-combative and non-polemic source, actually two, that maybe I have my understanding of Catholicism versus Protestantism and more particularly Calvinism backwards. I have been giving a lot of thought to this and near as I can tell the problem seems to lie in my understanding of the meaning of the word individualism, at least as the term is used by the various sects or denominations and humanists. Back to the drawing boards. Maybe someone can explain to me what is understood by individualism in and vis-a-vis the tenets of the various denominations and humanism, including individualism versus the collective and what is meant by the collective itself by each of these groups. In other words, what does individualism AND what the collective mean to each of these schools of thought, and, for the sake of completeness, I suppose in relation to God or whatever other relatively common reference point.

Zach:"This makes it seem as though you give credence to a more deistic paradigm; is that a fair assessment?"Not as I understand it. I believe knowledge through revelation is valid, although I would stop short of declaring the Bible to be inerrant, and I believe God can and does intervene in the universe."God is good and good is God, yet God is not separate from good, so we can’t say that God “decides” what is good any more then we can say that good “decides” what is God. Agreed?"I would agree is so far as I believe God does not decide what is good, God simply IS good.

James,Since Everett deems it acceptable to speak for the "religious side," I will go ahead and provide the "Secular Side" position:Anything goes. Strongman wins.Does that about sum it up, Everett?

Tao, please see my post above under Zach. I put it there just so that it is close to what I was referring and I can be prompted, but I can also be prompted here or a new thread started in the next page. You seem to be able to think more clearly and less dogmatically (and I am using the term strictly in its neutral meaning) about these things than most anyone else.

I often wondered about the legacy of persecution that some Christians talk about. You have to wonder why that there are any left with all of the ones that were fed to the lions. Except we know that wasn't true because the coliseums were reserved for gladiator fights. If any animals were used, they were in the back woods and they weren't lions but probably dogs or wolves. Now a Notre Dame professor has shed new light on the whole martyrdom question. Candida Moss, a Professor of New Testament Studies, has written "The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom " I heard an in depth interview of her on the Reasonable Doubt podcast.She started off the interview by addressing the most frequent instance cited as proof of Christian persecution. That would be the law mandated by Decius in 250 CE that all people that did not convert to the Roman religion be executed. Professor Moss states that the evidence shows that this particular persecution may have lasted as little as one month. It was really an attempt by Decius to legitimize his regime and to bring the country together. Such edicts were not uncommon She goes on to talk about ideas that were common to various groups, Christians , Jews, Romans and Greeks. And it was the idea of a noble death. The idea that a living a good life and dying for principle was something that all agreed was a noble pursuit. For that reason, Professor Moss believes that many of the martyrdom stories were simply made up to follow a particular story archetype. The heroes or heroines do or say things that were said in a Greek or Roman story about dying a noble death. She then relates another occurrence where just after Constantine installed Christianity as the state religion, scribes were under pressure to churn out as many stories of martyred Christians as they could. Here rather than craft a story that was like some sort of epic , the same stories were used and Christian names were installed as the protagonists. She termed this the cookie cutter martyrdom method.Moss also talks about the Nero persecutions. She mirrors what I have read from other sources. But she adds some things. For one thing she says that Tacitus writing some 50 years after the event occurs. outlines the frequently cited persecution. However, if Nero persecuted anyone , it wasn't Christians. For one thing in 64 CE, Christians were not referred to as Christians. Paul never used a term and it didn't start being used until the turn of the first century. Christianity was such a new sect that it is doubtful that they would have even come to Nero's attention. Rather this was probably a hatchet job by Tacitus, who didn't like Nero.She said that dying for Christ had great appeal among the early Christians. She relates a story where Christians wanted to die like Christ. This was before suicide became taboo. They went to the local governor and asked to be executed like Christ. He said that he wanted no part of their death and state that he was sure that they could secure enough rope to do the job themselves. But that early Christians would die so easily for their faith is eerily similar to the same behaviors that take place even today.Professor Moss thinks that Christians should not try to use a legacy of persecution that never really existed. And rather than calling the school prayer ban, persecution, she says the worry should be what is being taught in schools. Maybe we can all agree on that.

GregI was about to go to bed thinking of myself as a devout Christian, but then I read your post.Now I am filled with doubt as to the truth.Please tell me all you know about professor Moss.You see, unlike you, I am reluctant to discard all I believe in on the word of one women.Make this transition as easy and painless as possible, and tell me what you know about Moss.I was about to say God bless, but I caught myself.It wouldn't help to have you think I was putting some sort of a hex on you, would it.

God help the students unlucky enough to be cornered into Professor Moss' "Martyr's 101" classroom!Perhaps they should ask for their parents' tuition money to be refunded...Or for those in the worst-case scenario--a few years down the road stuck jobless in the Obama economy paying back a student loan that paid the salary of Prof. Moss for teaching that kind of claptrap--don't blame the collective or the Tea Party, look in the mirror, and keep up the job hunt. It will more than likely take a while and will be nothing compared with all those manufacturing and engineering jobs forced into China by American liberalism.

Hey James,Re your quandary to Mr. E here:http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/religion-diversity-tolerance-governance/topics/do-we-need-religion-have?commentid=5729536"I, and I speak only for myself, place no restraints on God. If you are sure I do you should have no problem telling me how. So I ask, how?" --- The greatest restraint you place on your God is that you are created in His image. When we limit our gods thusly, so too do they limit us. Reciprocity in action. ;-)http://www.opednews.com/populum/uploaded/just-like-me--22149-20120910-535.jpgCheers!

JimIt wasn't me who said we were created in Gods image, it was God.Genesis 1:26-271:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.I don't see where this puts restraints on God, more likely you don't understand the meaning.Here's two links to help you out.http://www.gci.org/humans/imagehttp://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/cm/v4/n1/man-image-of-godIf you do not find my links helpful, take it up with God, but leave out the .jpg link, I'm pretty sure God would not be amused.

1/2Hi Tao,Re your reply to Zach here: http://tiny.cc/i7fzvw "Maybe this is a limitation of human language. If God and good are one and the same, thus good has no meaning relevant to God apart from His essence, then what word do we used to describe the goodness that defines Him?" --- Excellent Tao! You are quite close to Lao Tzu & your namesake here, The Way/Tao. The first two verses of The Tao Te Ching: "The way that can be described is not the eternal Way. The name that can be named is not the eternal Name." Understand this & the world becomes much clearer. :-)http://tiny.cc/mzgzvw Re your reply to me here: http://tiny.cc/58fzvw ”Jim Harvey said:Shouldn't the moral action be it's own reward? It seems to me that only evil requires reward for doing good. Good never requires anything, reward or otherwise, for honoring it's own good virtue.”"A very valid point and I’ve argued that doing good purely on principle is the ideal." --- No Tao, not quite ideal yet, but getting much closer than motivational fear & reward. Principle, concept, method, etc., all arise via ignorance of one's true self nature, manifesting thru the differentiating abstract thought capacity of the human mind. We are potentially corrupted by our first thought, & the corruption potential only snowballs from there. Western Religion, despite all the good it has done, does the greatest disservice to its practitioners by convincing them that they are inherently evil, fallen, of sinful nature, cursed w/Original Sin by a "loving" God, & so on, w/no possibility of redemption w/o reliance on an external savior via ideologies limited by human language.	http://tiny.cc/wagzvw When one let's go of the clinging mind & its obsession w/differing ideologies & external sources of redemption, regardless of imagined principle or motivational fear, punishment, reward, desire, etc..., all that is left is one's true self nature which is inherently good by virtue alone. Those convinced to "believe" they are inherently evil, or that the world itself which manifests from the same self nature is cruel & evil, can never realize or understand the pure virtue of simply BEING good. They must always be saved from their own evil selves & the world itself by some external savior, usually imbued w/supernatural powers, but not necessarily, & ultimately by those who convinced them that they are inherently evil in the first place. First convince them they are sick, then provide them a cure making them wholly dependent on the cure provider, Psychology 101. Or, from the perspective of The Tao Te Ching: "An evil person tries to do good and in doing so does evil. A good person does nothing and yet leaves nothing undone."http://tiny.cc/hfgzvw "However, you have to recognize that we can never divorce ourselves from our own inclinations completely and even when going good, at least part of our motivation comes from our desire of an end rather than pure principle. --- Which is exactly why reliance on principle is still in the realm of ignorance & can be a formidable obstacle to realization of one's true self nature as well as assisting one in this regard.http://tiny.cc/rggzvw Continued…

2/2”I freely admit that the promise of an eternal afterlife is a powerful motivation for my faith, though it is not the only motivation.” --- When one's self nature is fully realized no motivation is required, one simply exists in a state of natural good being & would never even consider evil as an alternative state of being. The differentiating thinking mind consumed by ignorance & delusion otoh is the root of all evil. Or again, from the perspective of The Tao Te Ching: "Learning builds daily accumulation, but the practice of Tao builds daily simplification. Simplify and simplify, until all contamination from relative, contradictory thinking is eliminated. Then one does nothing, yet nothing is left undone. One who wins the world does so by not meddling with it. One who meddles with the world loses it." It is our delusional contradictory thinking that does us in. Such as believing that a loving almighty God created us according to His divine plan & then condemns all to Hell simply for not acknowledging the divinity of His Son, also in accordance w/His divine plan. Welcome to the Absolutism Theater of the Absurd, please check all logic, common sense, rationale & reasoning at the door, we’ll have none of that in here! ;-)http://tiny.cc/6lgzvw "Though his mind is not for rentTo any god or governmentAlways hopeful, yet discontentHe knows changes aren't permanentBut change isThe world is, the world isLove and life are deepMaybe as his eyes are wide"http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/KNZru4JG_Uo&autoplay=1 Re you reply to Zach here: http://tiny.cc/togzvw Zach West wrote:"God is good and good is God, yet God is not separate from good, so we cant say that God decides what is good any more then we can say that good decides what is God. Agreed?""I would agree is so far as I believe God does not decide what is good, God simply IS good." --- Very good Tao! You are quite close to realizing the virtue of self nature thru which all manifested things arise, including the gods. :-) All you need now is to collapse the paradox of an uncreated God being the ultimate creator & you got it! Tho it really is quite simple, it is not easy when the clinging mind is involved, so absolutely sure of its indoctrinated & ingrained certainties & beliefs which it knows it does not know & yet insists that it does. http://tiny.cc/4qgzvw Good luck in breaking free in your journey! 8-)http://tiny.cc/hhmzvw Cheers!

""(P)eople often talk as if the 'annihilation' of a soul were intrinsically possible. In all our experience, however,the destruction of one thing means the emergence of something else. Burn a log, and you have gases, heat and ash. To have been a log means now being those three things. If soul can be destroyed, must there not be a state of having been a human soul? And is not that, perhaps, the state which is equally well described as torment, destruction, and privation?""Hell was God's final gift to mankind." (I've heard that this or something like it can also be credited to Lewis as well, but i haven't been able to find the citation for this one.)The dual nature of reality...good and evil...which are a common-sense reality for all of us...necessitate a moral order. Free will decisions of the human soul call for perfect justice, and human beings seek organization and rationality at the core, so it follows that these are also attributes of our Creator.Jim-Jong,You are nearly there, just jettison the foolish notion that all action is right action, that all things are God and that He is not separate, and then you will have it. There is certainly nothing at all wrong with seeking truth and virtue and perceiving life as a journey. All those things are goodness, man, but a belief that there is not good and evil, that everything is God, that our human mind is God, that nothing is everything, that disorder is order, that action requires no motivation, and that accomplishment is born of an empty mind...all of this is pure nonsense."Every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind--is, in the end, Hell." C.S. Lewis

Hi Keithfersan,"...all of this is pure nonsense." --- Yes, at your current place & time as you understand it, I fully agree that it is pure nonsense for you & you should stick to your own preferred more comfortable form of nonsense for now. ;-) Tao appears to be a bit further along & less rigid in his thinking than you. As such, his views are more interesting to me as they are not nearly as predictable as yours.http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs13/f/2007/062/b/7/Made_in_Gods_Image_by_MacIomhair.jpg :DBtw, how's your Secession Obsession Confusion Demon exorcism coming along? I did my very best to urge Nanc to apologize to Greg & the Christian Scientists for doubting Jesus' holy words that all things are possible thru faith & thus get her faith back on track & up to a full charge in order to miraculously exorcise your demon. But to my dismay, I just read your post here and it is clear you are about to go into full panic confusion mode hallucinating Black Helicopters coming to get 'cha...http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/religion-diversity-tolerance-governance/topics/do-we-need-religion-have?commentid=5705260Oh Nanc, why hast thou forsaken me? Why doesth thou withhold your miraculous demon exorcist powers from healing our mutual friend Keithfersan's confusion demon? I beseech thee, please take pity on poor Brother Keithfersan & all those he inflicts his confusion on. Otherwise the future looks bleak for him & Angrywhitemenistan. :-( Please don't make me have to explain the inevitability that his demon possessed mind has in store for him & the rest of the Ditto Heads just crazy enough to follow him. I have seen his desired future & it ain't pretty I can assure you. http://www.nickloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/god-creating-the-world1.jpg ;-)Cheers!

India Coffee Exports Likely to Jump By
Debiprasad Nayak And Biman Mukherji March 9, 2011 7:25 a.m. ET
MUMBAI – India's coffee growers, encouraged by global prices surging to a near 14-year high, are queuing to export the beans and look set to boost shipments by about a fourth in the current quarter, industry executives said Wednesday. Coffee exports from India, Asia's third-largest producer, are likely to rise to 90,000 metric tons during the January-March period from 72,774 tons a year earlier, they said. Already, shipments during...

The U.S. Justice Department said it is stepping up efforts to combat financial fraud in the Gulf of Mexico, amid fears that the billions of dollars offered to compensate oil spill victims could be a magnet for criminals. Justice officials will announce on Tuesday that the National Center for Disaster Fraud, set up five years ago to act as a clearinghouse for cases stemming from Hurricane Katrina, will turn its focus to cases related to the oil spill. The department will investigate "any way that people are trying to take advantage of this disaster to benefit themselves fraudulently at the expense of others," Lanny Breuer, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division, said in an interview. The NCDF, based in Baton Rouge, La., has set up a telephone hotline for people to report potential fraud, anonymously if necessary. Starting this week, the number will be widely publicized in billboards and posters throughout the region, officials said. Officials and BP

PLC have become concerned that the $20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate those damaged by the oil spill could draw large numbers of bogus claims. According to one person familiar with the matter, a fund of that size will attract fraudsters "like bees to a honey pot." "Wherever there is money made available for legitimate assistance … there will be an irreducible minimum of individuals who will try to take advantage of that," said Jim Letten, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, who oversees the disaster fraud center. But BP and law enforcement officials are also concerned about a much broader array of potential fraud. The energy company has recently issued warnings on social networks like Facebook about fake "claims adjusters" who, it says, are contacting people offering to file claims for a fee. "We're saying to people: Beware, there are people around. They're trying to get money from you," a BP spokesman said. BP executives have said little about the possibility of fraud in public since outgoing chief executive Tony Hayward was criticized for suggesting that some people would try to take advantage of the compensation effort. "This is America," Mr. Hayward said earlier this year. "Come on. We're going to have lots of illegitimate claims. We all know that." The Justice Department's efforts come after control of the fund was officially transferred on Monday to the official appointed by the White House to administer it, Kenneth Feinberg. Mr. Feinberg and other officials have previously expressed their concern that the fund could be flooded with bogus claims. Mr. Breuer said that any suspected fraudulent claims uncovered by Mr. Feinberg would be referred directly to the Justice Department's criminal division for investigation. They will target only those claimants who knowingly lie in their applications, not anyone who has made an unwitting mistake, officials said. The Justice Department center that will investigate the cases has received and screened more than 39,000 complaints of disaster fraud following floods, tornadoes, earthquakes and wildfires. More than 25,000 of those complaints were referred to law enforcement for investigation, according to the Justice Department. The department has so far charged more 1,300 defendants in fraud cases related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Write to Thomas Catan at thomas.catan@wsj.com Email

December 2, 2011
A tale of unlikely friendship has become this year's unexpected home-grown box-office hit in France, leaving Steven Spielberg's "The Adventures of Tintin" and other Hollywood productions behind. A scene from France's 'Intouchables.' Gaumont "Intouchables" ("Untouchables"), a $12 million film in which a quadriplegic millionaire hires a young black home-care aide, has attracted more than 10 million viewers since it opened in French theaters four weeks ago. (To be sure, "Tintin" has proved a hit as well, with about five million French viewers since its Oct. 26 debut, according to French cinema association CBO-Box Office.) The millionaire in "Intouchables" is played by François Cluzet, a veteran who starred in the 2006 international hit thriller "Tell No One." Up-and-coming stand-up comic Omar Sy plays the aide. Co-directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache were inspired by a 2004 documentary; their fictional version is set to be distributed in around 40 countries. U.S. producer Harvey Weinstein of Weinstein Co. bought the rights to a remake before the film had finished being cut, Mr. Toledano said. Weinstein Co. declined to comment. The studio has said it plans a U.S. release next year. The box-office performance of "Intouchables" demonstrates how France is still resisting the dominance of U.S. films. Out of the 575 films released in France last year, 270 were French-led productions. With more than 5.6% of global cinema ticket sales last year, France's film market is the third biggest in the world, after the U.S. and Japan, according to data from IHS Screen. Before "Intouchables" hits the U.S., French filmmakers are hoping to conquer U.S. theaters with "The Artist," a mostly silent, black-and-white comedy about an early Hollywood star that won the New York Film Critics Circle award for best picture of 2011 this week.

Updated June 13, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET
New York Rare is the performing artist who turns up his nose at the reassuring sound of applause—even when it comes at an inopportune moment. But I know a fair number of anxious audience members who live in fear of clapping at the wrong time, as well as others who believe that when it comes to expressing approval of a performance, silence is golden. Go to a classical concert and you’ll see what I mean: Anyone who dares to clap in between the movements of a symphony is likely to get glared at, or even shushed. The purpose of these signs of disapproval, so far as I can tell, is to encourage the offender to slink home in red-faced shame, never to be seen again. Enlarge Image
Randy Jones Playgoers are less inclined to frown on untimely applause, though some would have it otherwise. I recently received an email from a reader in Washington, D.C., who made a special trip to New York to see the Broadway revival of Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot.” He was startled by the fact that “the audience broke out into applause whenever an actor came onstage—it felt like we were at a taping of a sitcom—as well as after anything that could be described as a ‘performance’ of some sort. A friend told me that this is common on Broadway. Is it because of the tourists, or something that’s part of the culture of Broadway itself? And do you agree that it is much better to let the actors go on uninterrupted and express your appreciation at the end? Or am I just being parochial?” I can report from first-hand experience that American playgoers aren’t the only ones who clap whenever they please. Just last week I flew to Canada to see a performance of Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest” at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and the audience responded to the show and its performers in exactly the same way as did the Broadway audience described by my correspondent. It didn’t bother me in the least: “The Importance of Being Earnest” is, after all, one of the greatest comedies ever written, and I can’t see much difference between laughing and clapping. As for the applause that greets the actors in “Waiting for Godot,” it’s worth pointing out that three of them, Nathan Lane, Bill Irwin and John Goodman, are stars (albeit of very different sorts). It’s long been common, on Broadway and elsewhere, to mark the first entrance of a star with a burst of applause. But is it right for so deeply serious a play as “Waiting for Godot” to be interrupted by such public displays of affection? Yes, “Godot” is a modern classic, and a thoroughly unsettling one—but it’s also a funny play, one in which comedy is used to heighten the audience’s awareness of its own existential dilemma. A performance of “Godot” at which no one laughed or clapped would be a performance that no one had understood. Classical music is, or can be, a different matter—but who says that it’s wrong to clap between movements? Alex Ross, the music critic of The New Yorker, has looked into the matter and reports that “until the beginning of the 20th century, applause between movements and even during movements was the sign of a knowledgeable, appreciative audience, not of an ignorant one.” Pierre Monteux, the great French conductor who gave the premiere of “The Rite of Spring,” was born in 1875, which made him old enough to remember how things were in the 19th century. “I do have one big complaint about audiences in all countries, and that is their artificial restraint from applause between movements of a concerto or symphony,” he said in 1959. “Of course applause should be spontaneous, not dutiful, but often it is the most natural thing to applaud between movements.” I couldn’t agree more. If you don’t feel moved to clap at the end of a first-rate performance of, say, the spectacular quick-step march that is the third movement of Tchaikovsky’s “Pathétique” Symphony, you probably need to loosen up. I’ve long thought that opera buffs and balletomanes have a saner attitude toward applause: They clap whenever they like something, and cheer when they like it a lot. Unlike their po-faced concert-hall brethren, they understand that theater is a social art, and that any public performance, be it of “Swan Lake,” Beethoven’s Ninth or “Shrek the Musical,” is by definition a social occasion as well as an artistic one. Human beings come to performances in order to enjoy art, and to have their pleasure enhanced by the presence of their fellow creatures. In a perfect world, every play would be a festival and every concert a celebration. Are there occasions when silence is both socially and artistically appropriate? Sure. At the end of a symphony or a play that ends quietly, the most eloquent tribute that you can possibly pay to the performers on stage is to leave your hands in your lap, take a deep breath and let it out very, very slowly. Then, and only then, does the moment come to break the collective stillness and express your appreciation by clapping. The rule is simple: When in doubt, wait—then let ’er rip. You’ll be glad you did. —Mr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, writes “Sightings” every other Saturday and blogs about the arts at www.terryteachout.com. Write to him at tteachout@wsj.com.

By
John Bolton
Updated Aug. 31, 2009 10:48 p.m. ET
Last week, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed elBaradei attempted to whitewash Iran's nuclear weapons program by issuing a report ignoring substantial information about weaponization activities and downplaying continued noncooperation. Even the Obama administration apparently now understands that resuming the long-stalled "Permanent-Five plus-one" negotiations (the U.N. Security Council's permanent members plus Germany) with Iran is highly unlikely to halt Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Accordingly, President Obama is readying two alternatives. One is to characterize "freezing" Iran's nuclear program at existing levels as a "success." However, this less than complete termination of Iran's nuclear program would run contrary to years of determined clandestine efforts. Such a freeze is utterly unverifiable and amounts to surrender. This will result in a nuclear-armed Iran. The other Obama administration ploy is "strong sanctions" imposed by the United States and other countries. This will also be a "success" only in the sense that it will allow the administration to claim a win. It won't actually prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. One idea for robust sanctions now before Congress is to prohibit exports of refined petroleum products—such as gasoline—to Iran. Today, Iran imports 40% of its daily refined petroleum consumption. Other proposals include international financial and insurance-related sanctions. Enlarge Image

Associated Press These ideas are well-intentioned and worth pursuing. If imposed, they will create shortages that will likely increase internal dissatisfaction with Iran's regime, thereby hopefully contributing to its ultimate demise. But no one should believe that tighter sanctions will, in the foreseeable future, have any impact on Iran's nuclear weapons program. Six years ago more stringent measures against Iran might have worked, but today they are an idea whose time has come and gone. Their inadequacy stems from several causes. First, the U.N. Security Council is no more likely now to approve strict sanctions against Iran than in the past. The prospects for Russian and Chinese support are between slim and none, since endorsing sanctions would harm their own economic and political interests in Iran. The most to expect from the council is a fourth sanctions resolution, as weak and ineffective as its predecessors, and only after weeks or months of agonizing negotiations. Second, for those who understand the Security Council reality, most talk of enhanced sanctions envisages a coalition of the willing, consisting essentially of America, Japan and the European Union. But the EU's record to date, and Japan's likely policy under its new government (soon to be run by the Democratic Party of Japan), are hardly likely to produce a stiff, serious and sustained effort. Iran itself will offer countless reasons why sanctions should be suspended, reduced or ignored, and a disquieting amalgam of Western governments, businesses and commentators will agree at every step. It is very likely that EU resolve will fracture and Japan will follow suit. Moreover, many other countries will use the lack of a Security Council imprimatur to conduct business with Tehran, shredding the coalition's sanctions, and thereby weakening EU resolve still further. Third, Iran is hardly standing idly by while sanctions that target its refined petroleum products are debated by the U.S. and other countries. Tehran's leaders are acutely aware of their vulnerability and are moving to address it. Iran, with extensive Chinese involvement, has already begun building new refineries and expanding existing facilities with the aim of approximately doubling domestic capacity by 2012. This will more than compensate for its current refining shortfall. Whether Iran can complete these projects on schedule remains to be seen, but the level of effort is intense and serious. Tehran is also eliminating government subsidies that make retail gasoline cheaper than it otherwise would be. This will raise prices and thereby reduce consumption. Slashing consumer benefits is rarely popular, but this step alone will substantially reduce the pressure on Iran's refineries to produce. One can also be sure that the Revolutionary Guards' access to gasoline will not be diminished. Iran claims to have substantially increased its strategic gasoline reserves over the past year (though that increase has not been confirmed). Most significantly, Iran's estimated natural gas reserves (948 trillion cubic feet in 2008) are second only to Russia's, and more than quadruple the U.S.'s. Here is "energy independence" for Iran that would make T. Boone Pickens envious, since relatively small capital expenditures can refit large motor-vehicle fleets (such as Iran's military and security services) to run on compressed natural gas. Iran also plans to increase subsidies for natural gas, thus diminishing consumer anger over lost gasoline subsidies. For Washington, the question should not be whether "strict sanctions" will cause some economic harm despite Iran's multifarious, accelerating efforts to mitigate them. Instead, we must ask whether that harm will be sufficient to dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons. Objectively, there is no reason to believe that it will. Adopting tougher economic sanctions is simply another detour away from hard decisions on whether to accept a nuclear Iran or support using force to prevent it. Mr. Bolton, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of "Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad" (Simon & Schuster, 2007). Email
