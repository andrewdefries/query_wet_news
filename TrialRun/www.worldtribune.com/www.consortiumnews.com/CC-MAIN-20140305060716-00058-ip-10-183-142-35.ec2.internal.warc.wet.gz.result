Reflections on the Ninth of August By Gary G. Kohls, MD August 8, 2010
Editor’s Note: Some days stand out as times for celebration; others for sadness. There are anniversaries of marriage, parties for births, and recollections of death.
However, as Gary G. Kohls notes in this guest essay, August 9 should be a special moment for reflection on how Christians, followers of a pacifist rabbi who advocated love for one’s neighbor and turning the other cheek to one’s enemies, could instead engage in unspeakable violence against others, including innocent Christians:
On the 9th of August 1945, an all-Christian B-29 bomber crew took off from Tinian Island in the South Pacific with the blessings of Catholic and Protestant chaplains. In the plane’s hold was the second of the only two nuclear bombs to ever be used against human targets in wartime. The primary target, Kokura, Japan, was clouded over, so the plane, named Bock’s Car, headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. St. Mary’s Cathedral, located in Nagasaki City’s Urakami River district, was a massive structure and a landmark easily visible from 31,000 feet above. The cathedral was one of the landmarks on which the Bock’s Car’s bombardier had been briefed for weeks before the mission. The Urakami cathedral was briefly seen through a break in the clouds, and the drop was ordered. The bomb exploded in a searing fireball as hot as the sun 500 meters above the church.
Most Nagasaki Christians who lived in the area did not survive. Six thousand of the church members died instantly, including all who were at confession at 11:02 a.m. that morning. Of the 12,000 members of the church, eventually 8,500 died as a direct result of the bomb. Three orders of nuns and a Christian girl’s school were incinerated. All told, tens of thousands of innocent people died instantly and hundreds of thousands were horribly wounded, some of whose progeny are still living in agony as a result of the cross-generational contagiousness of the deadly plutonium. An irradiated crucifix was photographed in the days following the blast, lying helpless and forlorn and thrown onto its back, a deeply profound symbol of a religion gone wrong. The Urakami cathedral was the oldest and largest Christian church in the Orient, and Nagasaki had the oldest, largest and most influential Christian community in Japan, having been founded by the Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier, in 1549. The Nagasaki Christian community is legendary in the history of Japanese Christianity because of its two centuries of catacomb-like existence during the horrible persecutions by the Imperial Japanese government - including mass crucifixions of faithful Christians who refused to give up the faith. Despite the persecutions and the formal outlawing of the religion (it was a capital crime to be a Christian - as it was for the original nonviolent form of Christianity - for over two centuries), Nagasaki Christianity survived and ultimately flourished – until 11:02 a.m., Aug. 9, 1945.
