Well, technically, any taxi can be a “hangover taxi,” but this one’s more tailored to giving its passengers a gentle push into sobriety. Kabuto Noodles, a British-based Asian cuisine company is putting forth its “Kab-U-To Work” service in London for people who chased the night longer than they should have. View photo.Kab-U-To-Work taxi (Kabuto) On the company’s website, Kabuto writes , “This season we’re going to be trialling a bespoke taxi service to get you from your house to your office the night after your Christmas party - including a ‘hangover cure’ pack with some paracetamol, fresh orange juice, mints, sunglasses and a pot of hot Kabuto Noodles to eat on-the-go.” Mmm, orange juice, mints, and Asian noodles. The perfect flavor combination. Paracetamol is a pain reliver, by the way. (Kabuto) They say the idea was born out of a cynical attempt to gain attention them often hearing about how their noodles were being used to help get over hangovers. It will be free for anybody living in London who books during thetrial period before Christmas. According to Mail Online, a Kabuto spokesman said, “We have a limited number of available bookings but we have been taking them for a week and had some fantastic feedback. We've still got quite a bit of availability in the lead up to Christmas Eve!”More info: Kabuto, Mail Online

CAIRO (AP) — The president of Senegal commended France on Wednesday for its military intervention in Mali against Islamist militants, telling leaders of fellow Muslim nations that they cannot allow "a minority of terrorists to commit crimes, distort our faith and deepen hatred for Islam."Macky Sall's opening address laid bare the divisions among the nations taking part in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation's two-day summit in Cairo, which brings together leaders from across the Muslim world.The French-led military intervention in Mali, which includes forces from Senegal, is aimed at driving Islamist militants from the territory they have overrun in northern Mali in recent months.Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who is hosting the conference, has repeatedly denounced France's operation in Mali, saying Paris' action there would lead to the development of a hotspot in the area and lay the seeds for a wider and bloodier conflict. Morsi's Islamist allies at home have demonstrated outside the French embassy in Cairo to protest French intervention.Addressing the conference on Wednesday, Morsi did not directly condemn the French intervention, but made clear that Cairo did not favor military actions in Mali."We call for a comprehensive approach to deal with the situation there and any similar case" he said. "An approach that deals with all the different aspects of the crisis and its political, developmental and intellectual roots while safeguarding human rights."The deepest division in the Islamic world runs along the faith's Sunni-Shiite fault line, a rift that was on full display during a meeting on the eve of the summit by its most high profile participant — President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, the region's Shiite power.Sunni-Shiite tensions dominated talks between Ahmadinejad and Egypt's most prominent cleric, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayeb, who upbraided the Iranian leader on a string of issues and warned against Iranian interference in Gulf nations, particularly Bahrain, where the ruling Sunni minority has faced protests by the Shiite majority.El-Tayeb said attempts to spread Shiite Islam in mainly Sunni Arab nations were unacceptable and called for a halt to bloodshed in Syria, where Tehran's ally President Bashar Assad has been battling mainly Sunni rebels, according to a statement by Al-Azhar about the meeting.Politics & GovernmentReligion & BeliefsMali

In nod to IBM, HP overhaul minimizes consumers

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Hewlett-Packard's decision to surrender in smartphones and tablet computers and possibly get rid of its personal computer business underscores how Apple has transformed consumer electronics in just four years.HP's new CEO Leo Apotheker is now trying to turn the Silicon Valley stalwart into a twin of East Coast archrival IBM Corp. In doing so, he is acknowledging that his company has failed to balance the demands of both the consumer and corporate markets. As a result, it needs to exit most of its consumer businesses, just as IBM did six years ago.Apple is the hottest consumer electronics company on the planet. The iPhone's debut in 2007 brought ease of use and an intuitive design unmatched by predecessors, including smartphone pioneer Palm, which HP bought last year in hopes of getting a foothold in mobile devices. Apple followed in 2010 with the iPad tablet computer and managed to persuade people to buy a product they never knew they needed.Rather than remain locked in a futile fight with a company that seems to have found the magic touch on making hit consumer products, HP is whittling its competition to the other business technology specialists — namely, IBM, Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc."Apple singlehandedly knocked HP out of the PC, smartphone and tablet business," Gleacher & Co. analyst Brian Marshall said in an interview.HP's overhaul, announced Thursday, has three parts:— HP will stop making tablet computers and smartphones by October.— It will try to spin off or sell its PC business, the world's largest. By the end of next year, HP computers could be sold under another company's name.

— The company plans to buy business software maker Autonomy Corp. for about $10 billion in one of the biggest takeovers in HP's 72-year history. That would expand HP's software and services offerings, where IBM is strong.HP, the largest technology company in the world by revenue, will continue to sell servers and other equipment to business customers, just as IBM now does. Those businesses currently don't generate as much revenue for HP as PCs, but they have higher profit margins.Apotheker would not say whether any jobs will be cut. HP plans to take a charge of about $1 billion for restructuring and related costs, some of which could go for severance payments. HP employs more than 300,000 people worldwide.HP's move toward an IBM-style business model, which is focused on selling to corporations and governments, makes sense considering that Apotheker spent most of his career at German business software maker SAP AG, another company that catered to the technology needs of companies and government agencies."This is his bread and butter," Marshall said. "Now he has to deliver."Investors appeared underwhelmed and sent HP's stock down 6 percent Thursday on a day the broader market declined, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index falling 4.5 percent. In morning trading Friday, HP lost another 20 percent, or $5.81, to $23.70.Apotheker is seeking radical changes to help erase the stain of scandal and leave his imprint on a massive company he inherited last year. His predecessor, Mark Hurd, resigned under pressure a year ago, after an investigation found expense reports that were allegedly falsified to conceal a relationship with an HP marketing contractor.

In trying to ditch most of HP's consumer businesses, Apotheker is reversing a decade-long binge on computer hardware.The area where HP has been most visibly lacking is mobile devices.HP has been hopelessly outmatched in smartphones and tablets despite its $1.8 billion acquisition last year of Palm Inc., whose webOS software was the crown jewel of the deal. The software powered the fledgling TouchPad tablet and HP-powered smartphones that are being discontinued in Thursday's announcement.The software was well-reviewed, but iPhones and iPads and smartphones running Google Inc.'s Android operating system — made possible after Apple paved the way — have dominated the fastest-growing parts of the consumer technology market. HP was left in the margins. WebOS smartphones had a worldwide market share of less than 1 percent, according to Gartner.HP will try to find ways to keep webOS alive, which could include using it in other devices such as PCs and printers or licensing it to handset makers, Apotheker said in an interview. He said he was disappointed with the designs of HP's mobile devices and believed the business would have required too much money to turn around."We have better opportunities to invest our capital," he said.HP executives likely decided that "they were too late to the tablet market to make a dent," said Forrester Research analyst Charles Golvin. "They recognized they did not have a high probability of success."

HP conceivably could try to license webOS for use in cars and consumer electronics devices made by other companies, Golvin said. But even that is challenging because Google is targeting many of the same markets with its Android system, which is free."This begs the question of how much longer it will be before the other shoe drops and they close the Palm business entirely," Golvin said.The diminishing of the Palm business will be striking to many technologists.Jon Rubinstein, the former CEO of Palm, said in December that Palm sold itself because executives realized the business could be small and successful, but couldn't sustain itself on its own in the long run.Rubinstein, who was an Apple executive before leading Palm, said HP seemed to be the best choice because, given its size, it could help Palm bring its products to more people.In PCs, HP is acknowledging that it needs to reverse course on a path begun two CEOs ago, under Carly Fiorina. She pushed through the controversial decision to spend $19 billion for Compaq Computer. That set the stage for HP's ascent to become the world's top PC maker.PCs are HP's biggest revenue generator, but the business is also HP's least profitable, a result of falling prices for computers and brutal competition.HP's effort to jettison its PC business is another concession to Apple's increasing dominance of consumer electronics, said Shaw Wu, an analyst with Sterne Agee. The PC division also had become a drag on HP's stock even though it still accounts for about 15 percent of the company's earnings, Wu said."Apple is such a fierce competitor that HP probably realized it was going to have to cut its losses," Wu said. "And it makes sense to cut your losses sooner than later."The decision also makes HP's trajectory look similar to rival IBM's. A key player in building the PC market in the 1980s, IBM sold its PC business in 2005 to focus on software and services, which don't cost as much in labor and components as building computer hardware.The acquisition of Autonomy mirrors a key element of IBM's transformation from stodgy mainframe seller into a software and services powerhouse, which has made IBM the envy of many large technology companies.HP's net income increased in the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 31, but its lower-than-expected outlook for the current period weighed on the stock. The company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., also cut its full-year revenue outlook.___AP Technology Writers Michael Liedtke and Rachel Metz in San Francisco and Barbara Ortutay in New York contributed to this report.Leo Apotheker

BERLIN (AP) — German utilities say this year's share of renewable energies in the country's electricity production is forecast to rise some 15 percent on the year, largely on the back of a continuing solar-power boom.Utilities' industry association BDEW said Tuesday the share of wind, solar and biomass power is expected to rise from 20 percent in 2011 to 23 percent this year.Strong growth in new solar power installations — helped by subsidies — is expected to lead to a solar output surge of 47 percent to 28.5 billion kilowatt hours in 2011.Germany decided last year to phase out nuclear power by 2022 and replace it with renewable energies. They're expected to produce 40 percent of the country's energy by then, and 80 percent by 2050.Nature & EnvironmentRenewable Energy & Energy Saving
