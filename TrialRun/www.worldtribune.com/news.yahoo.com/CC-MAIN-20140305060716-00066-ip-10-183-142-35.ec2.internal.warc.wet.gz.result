ROME (AP) — Six Russians were killed and two seriously injured when the snowmobile and sled they were riding veered off an Italian Alpine ski slope at night, slammed into a barrier and flew through the air into a ravine.The accident occurred Friday, and when rescuers arrived at the scene six of the victims were found dead on the slope of Mount Cermis, in the Trentino-Alto Adige region of northeast Italy, said Cavalese Fire Department Cmdr. Roberto Marchi."It is clear that the fundamental cause is recklessness and imprudence," Marchi told Sky TG24 TV in an interview on the slope Saturday. It is labeled "pista nera" or the black ski run, indicating a level of steepness and other difficult conditions suitable only for the most experienced skiers.Six of the people involved in the accident were Russian tourists and the other two were Russians who worked in Italy in the tourist industry.Cavalese Mayor Silvano Welponer said that putting a driver and passenger in the snowmobile and having it pull six passengers in the sled "made for a very heavy load. You have to know what you are doing and have the experience" to safely handle that, he said.The ANSA news agency said authorities were performing tests to determine if the snowmobile's driver — who survived the crash — was drunk.

The sled-towing snowmobile cut a spectacular trajectory after it veered off the slope on a curve, hit the manmade barrier, flew through the air while shearing the tips off tree branches, then landed in the ravine, Italian news reports said.RAI state radio said the slope was unlit, and other Italian news reports quoted local officials as saying it had been closed for the day and that the only vehicles allowed on it when it is open are staff or rescue ones. The Russians were believed to have dined at the top of the slopes and were heading back to their hotel when they crashed, the reports said.The Russian consul general in Milan, Alexei Parmonov, said on Russian state television that he was in contact with Italian investigators, who he said suspect the crash was caused by excessive speed. They also were checking the possibility of a mechanical malfunction.Italian prosecutors formally opened a probe to see if manslaughter charges should be filed, Italian news reports said.Parmonov identified the four men and two women who died in the crash. Five of them and also one of the injured men were tourists from Krasnodar, a region in southern Russia that includes Sochi, which is preparing to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics. One of the dead women and the other injured man worked in Italy in the tourist industry.

The Russian diplomat identified the dead as Denis Kravchenko, Irina Kravchenko, Vyacheslav Sleptsov, Yulia Yudina, Lyudmila Yudina and Rafilya Pshenichnaya. The injured, he said, were Boris Yudin and Azat Agafarov. All except Pshenichnaya and Agafarov were tourists from Krasnodar. Yudin's 17-year-old son, who stayed behind in the hotel, lost his mother and sister in the accident, while his father was hospitalized with multiple fractures, Parmonov said.A day of entertainment had been planned for the Val di Fiemme ski resort area Saturday, ahead of the World Cup cross-country ski competition, but the festivities were canceled because of the accident.Two high-profile deadly accidents have occurred on Mount Cermis.In 1998, a U.S. Marine jet, flying low on a training run from a nearby air base, sliced a ski gondola's cable, sending the cable car crashing to the ground and claiming 20 lives. The accident triggered months of tension between Italy and the United States, two traditionally good allies.In 1976, a ski gondola broke off from its cable and plunged to the slope, killing 42 people.Disasters & AccidentsSkiing

Ancient Tides Wildly Different Than Today By OurAmazingPlanet StaffLiveScience.com

The ebb and flow of the tides is such a regular occurrence that almanacs predict them years in advance for coastal cities and beaches. But those predictions would have been pretty far off thousands of years ago.	Geological forces that act over hundreds to millions of years, such as plate tectonics, ice ages, land uplift, erosion and sedimentation, have caused the tides in certain places to vary wildly throughout history, a new study finds.	Some tides on the East Coast of the United States, for instance, may in the past have been enormously higher than they are today — a difference between low and high tide of 10-20 feet (3-6 meters), instead of the current 3-6 foot (1-2 m) range.	Tides in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, which today are among the most extreme in the world and have a range up to 55 feet (17 m), didn't amount to much at all about 5,000 years ago. But around that same time, tides on the southern U.S. Atlantic coast, from North Carolina to Florida, were about 75 percent higher.	One of the most interesting findings of the study, said study team member David Hill of Oregon State University, was that around 9,000 years ago, as the Earth was emerging from its most recent ice age, there was a huge amplification in tides of the western Atlantic Ocean. The tidal ranges were up to three times more extreme than those that exist today, and water would have surged up and down on the East Coast.	"In most of this research it was assumed that prehistoric tidal patterns were about the same as they are today. But they weren't, and we need to do a better job of accounting for this," said Hill, who studied the ancient tides with computer models.	One of the major variables in ancient tides, of course, was sea level changes that were caused by previous ice ages. When massive amounts of ice piled miles thick in the Northern Hemisphere 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, for instance, sea levels were more than 300 feet (91 m) lower.	But it's not that simple, Hill said.	"Part of what we found was that there are certain places on Earth where tidal energy gets dissipated at a disproportionately high rate, real hot spots of tidal action," Hill said. "One of these today is Hudson Bay, and it's helping to reduce tidal energies all over the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. But during the last ice age Hudson Bay was closed down and buried in ice, and that caused more extreme tides elsewhere."	Having a better understanding of what influence's Earth's tides and changes in them will help scientists better predict future changes, Hill said.	"And there will be changes, even with modest sea level changes like 1 meter [3 feet]. In shallow waters like the Chesapeake Bay, that could cause significant shifts in tides, currents, salinity and even temperature," he said.	The study was detailed in the Journal of Geophysical Research.	This story was provided by OurAmazingPlanet, a sister site to LiveScience.

Mich. police believe gas station clerk abducted
Police rule out friends, relatives after Mich. gas station clerk goes missing on night shift

This undated family photo released by the family of Jessica Heeringa via WOOD-TV shows the 25-year-old …
DETROIT (AP) -- Several friends and acquaintances of a petite 25-year-old gas station clerk who went missing while working the night shift have been ruled out in her disappearance, which western Michigan investigators are treating as an abduction, the local police chief said Monday. Police have frustratingly little evidence as they search for Jessica Heeringa, who disappeared Friday night shortly before the young mother was set to close an Exxon Mobil Corp. gas station in Norton Shores. The station didn't have a security camera and there were no signs of a struggle or robbery, though police have released a description of a vehicle and a man seen in the area. Norton Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw said relatives, friends and other people associated with Heeringa have been interviewed, and that investigators are "no longer really concerned with their activities from that night." "We're moving on, trying to find other people," Shaw said. A man trying to buy gas called police after finding the gas station open but no employees around. "There's nobody here," Craig Harpster, 54, told a 911 operator in a recorded conversation authorities released Monday. "I hollered, 'Hey,' walked around the building. ... It just seems strange." Investigators later found Herringa's purse and other personal belongings in the station, and the cash register untouched. Police described Herringa as 5-foot-1 and about 110 pounds. "There's no sign of a struggle, no sign of anything inside the store being disturbed," Shaw said. "The cash drawer was sitting out and no money was missing. Her purse was in the store with 400-some dollars in it. It's just odd how that occurred." Shaw said nearly two dozen law enforcement officials are following leads. The police chief described the city, home to about 24,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan, as "quite safe" with a low rate of violent crime. "The family believes that Jessica more than likely left to help (someone) in some way," Shaw said. "Their belief is that someone that she's either acquainted with or someone she was trying to help lured her out." Police are searching for a gray minivan and its driver, who is described as a white man, age 30 to 40, about 6 feet tall, with light brown wavy hair. The description is from witnesses who saw the van parked near the station and driving away. Heeringa's mother, Shelly Heeringa, told local media that she repeatedly told her daughter she worried about her working late by herself. "She said, 'Mom, don't worry. I can handle anybody,'" she said. Crime & JusticeSociety & Culture

RALEIGH, N.C. -- Jayson Megna scored his first NHL goal in the third period to go with an earlier assist, and the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-1 Monday night at PNC Arena. Megna, a 23-year-old center playing his second NHL game, tallied at 7:11 of the third period, with Sidney Crosby picking up his second assist of the game. Crosby sent the puck toward Hurricanes goalie Justin Peters, and the puck redirected off Megna and into the net. Tanner Glass and Chris Kunitz also scored for the Penguins, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Brooks Orpik provided three assists. Carolina (4-5-3) lost its third game in a row, all since goalie Cam Ward was hurt last week. Nathan Gerbe scored the Hurricanes' lone goal on a first-period power play. Marc-Andre Fleury made 20 saves for Pittsburgh (8-4-0). Peters, playing due to injuries to Ward and Anton Khudobin, is winless in three outings this season. Peters recorded 26 saves. The Penguins broke a 1-1 tie when Kunitz outreached Carolina's Jordan Staal for Crosby's pass with 3:36 left in the second period. In the first period, Glass blasted in a rebound of Megna's shot less than nine minutes into the game. Both of Glass' goals this season are against Carolina. The Hurricanes drew even when Gerbe scored on a 5-on-3 power play with 3:57 to go in the first period. Two of Gerbe's four goals this season are against Pittsburgh. It took the Hurricanes almost 12 minutes to register their first shot. Pittsburgh recorded the first nine shots of the game, scoring once. In the second period, the Penguins were without a shot for the first 8 1/2 minutes. Pittsburgh's Joe Vitale and Carolina's Brett Sutter exchanged punches in a first-period scuffle. It was the first fighting major for both players this season. NOTES: The Penguins entered the game with their first three-game losing streak since a six-game slump from Dec. 29, 2011-Jan. 11, 2012. ... Pittsburgh D Rob Scuderi missed his first game of the season, sitting out with a lower-body injury suffered in the first period Saturday at Toronto. Scuderi had played 276 consecutive games, the team's longest active streak. ... D Robert Bortuzzo was in the lineup in Scuderi's place. ... Hurricanes LW Jeff Skinner missed his second game with an undisclosed upper-body injury. ... D Tim Gleason played in his first home game of the season and his second game overall after missing the start of the season with an injury. ... The Penguins return home for a Wednesday night game against the Boston Bruins. ... The Hurricanes stay home for a Friday night matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning.Ice HockeySports & RecreationCarolina HurricanesPittsburgh Penguinsthe PenguinsSidney CrosbyNathan GerbeJustin Peters
