CANNES, France (AP) — Associated Press journalists open their notebooks at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival:Will a switched-at-birth Japanese drama tug on Steven Spielberg's heart strings?The Cannes Film Festival was wondering that Saturday, when Kore-eda Hirokazu's elegant and emotional "Like Father, Like Son" premiered. It quickly emerged as an early contender for the Palme d'Or, the winner of which will be decided by a jury headed by Spielberg.Though reviews varied, "Like Father, Like Son" largely charmed Cannes with its sweet, understated examination of nature versus nurture.In it, two sets of parents find out, shortly before their sons' 6th birthday, that their babies were switched at birth. The families are opposites of one another: one headed by a wealthy, driven professional (the Japanese pop singer Fukuyama Masaharu) with strict expectations of his only child; the other father a poor but lively shopkeeper (Lily Franky) with two other playful children.With the graceful simplicity that characterizes Kore-eda's films ("I Wish," ''Nobody Knows"), the film contemplates the nature of parenthood — where it begins, how it develops — as the two families debate exchanging their sons."He told me the film was the story of how to become a father," Fukuyama told reporters Saturday, referring to Kore-eda. The film focuses on the actor's character, as he slowly begins to question his hard, remote approach to fatherhood."I wanted to create in his mind a real shock, a healthy shock," said Kore-eda.The director said the film, which ends ambiguously, wasn't made to convey a message, but to reflect his own experiences. Kore-eda has a son similar in age to the boys in the film.

Spielberg has long gravitated to stories of fathers and sons, but whether "Like Father, Like Son" struck a chord with him won't be answered until the Palme d'Or is announced May 25 at the end of the festival.— Jake Coyle, http://twitter.com/jake_coyleREV RUN, KING OF ... DJs?Rev Run is one of hip-hop's legendary rappers, but these days, he's spinning records — and is finding the experience may be even more enjoyable than rapping."I love the Run-DMC shows: it's big, it's intense," he said in an interview on Friday. "Me and (partner) D (Darryl "DMC" McDaniels) know the lyrics like riding a bike because we've been doing it since we were kids. But this is different. This is fun. I'm in Vegas every other week."It's very cool to be a DJ," he added. "I'm a part of that and proud of that and thankful for that — that I can do a stadium one day and be in Cannes the next day."Run was at the Cannes Film Festival on Friday night to perform at the Belvedere Vodka party with his partner, DJ Ruckus. Among the celebrities in attendance for the party included "Hunger Games" star Liam Hemsworth, singer Solange Knowles and DJ/producer Diplo.In an interview a few hours before the show, Run said that he started DJ'ing about three years ago when people started asking him to show up to parties. Though he does rap some during his sets, he doesn't do too much:

"I'm not going to go out and do Run-DMC records without d. I'll throw on a Run-DMC record and throw on my part a little bit, you'll get the essence," he said. "I'm a celebrity DJ."Ruckus said he has learned a lot from Run — "It's obviously an honor to be on the road and have such a mentor and legend and somebody who helped create all of what I worked with."And Run said he's learned from his younger counterpart as well"I don't know all that's going on with all of these different genres of EDM (electronic dance music). Like, I don't know the difference between Berlin and (David) Guetta. Like, 'Huh? Aren't they both house DJs?' 'No, they're not.' So I'm trying to learn from him," he said. "I don't know what the heck is going on. . I'm learning that from him, but I'm happy and open and excited about it. "Run hasn't given up his day job: next week, he's performing at the Atlanta Braves' baseball stadium with partner McDaniels for a Run-DMC gig after the team's game. He's also planning a return to reality TV, with an HGTV show showing the renovation of his home with his family."If you've seen 'Run's House,' you know what it's going to be. It's the same thing, but with a twist," he said.— Nekesa Mumbi Moody, http://www.twitter.com/nekesamumbiJACKIE CHAN HAS HIS NEXT FILMS LINED UP — ALL IN HIS MIND

Jackie Chan is at the Cannes Film Festival to talk about his upcoming film "Skiptrace," but he's already thinking about his next project."You know everything in my mind always keep, keep, keep (moving)," he said in an interview Friday. "This movie (I had the idea) 20 years ago. So I have so many movies, 20 years, 30 years, 50 years, 70 years, all in my mind. Then I call my writer, 'Write it down! That's your job, write it down this script. Write it down this thing.' So many things."Chan doesn't just have movies he's working on. He's also got his own brand of toe socks; during an interview, he was wearing a bright green pair. The socks have pressure points and grips on the bottom for each pair.But unfortunately for anyone interested in getting a pair, according to Chan, they are yet to have global distribution."Not now, soon," he said.— Louise Dixon, http://www.twitter.com/loudixonFEELING LIKE THE ETERNAL BRIDE ON RED CARPETSIndian actress Sonam Kapoor loves red carpets. In fact, she loves the experience so much that she likens it to a wedding."It is really strange, but I feel like every time I go onto the red carpet I feel like I am getting married," she said with a laugh."So it is fine if I don't get married eventually," she added with a wry smile.For some, the experience of picking an outfit and standing in front of the world's media is a daunting prospect, but Kapoor, being an actress at heart, treats the carpet like a stage."It depends on what character I want to be, so it is a bit like choosing your roles and deciding what I want to be at that point," she explained in an interview this week.Kapoor is in Cannes to fulfill her duty as an ambassador for L'Oreal. She has no films at the festival, but has a lot to keep her busy in the future."I have three films right now: 'Ranjhana' which literally translates into Romeo, then there is this biopic which is about an athlete and there is this untitled project which is a romantic comedy," she said.— Sian Watson, http://www.twitter.com/sianwatsonArts & EntertainmentMoviesSteven Spielberg

Navy: Man who died on ship off Africa an ex-SEAL

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — One of two American security officers found dead on a ship off the coast of Africa was a former Navy SEAL, according to a service record released to The Associated Press on Thursday.Mark Daniel Kennedy, 43, of Baton Rouge, La., enlisted in 1995 and completed his final tour of duty in 2008, according to his record, sent in an email by Navy spokeswoman Lt. Lauryn Dempsey. The SEALs are an elite unit of the military's special operations forces. Kennedy served as a special operator first class, his record says.Police say Kennedy and Jeffrey Reynolds, 44, were found dead Tuesday in a cabin on the Norfolk-based Maersk Alabama — a ship made famous in a 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates, an incident dramatized in the movie "Captain Phillips" starring Tom Hanks.The ship was berthed in Port Victoria in the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles. Police there have given no cause of the deaths. They say the men worked for Virginia-based Trident Security, which was founded by former SEALs and employs former special warfare operators to provide security. Requests to Trident for information about the men have not been answered.Police in Africa and the U.S. Coast Guard have said they are investigating the deaths.Former military personnel frequently provide security on board ships sailing through the waters off Somalia to provide security against pirate attacks.The Maersk Alabama's parent company Maersk Line, Ltd., also is based in Norfolk. The Maersk Line said Wednesday that the cause of death is under investigation but is "not related to vessel operations or their duties as security personnel."The Alabama transports food aid to East Africa in support of the U.S. government's "Food for Peace" program, according to the company. Crew members also help support the Bee Hive Children's Home in Mombasa, Kenya.Several crew members who were aboard the ship when it was hijacked in 2009 are suing Maersk Line Ltd. and Mobile, Ala.-based Waterman Steamship Corp. over the attack. The hijacking captured world headlines in 2009 and again when "Captain Phillips" was released last year. The five-day hijacking standoff ended when Navy SEALs aboard the USS Bainbridge shot and killed three of the pirates who were holding Capt. Richard Phillips in a lifeboat.Nine crew members in the lawsuit filed in Alabama in 2012 say they suffered physical and emotional injuries after Somali pirates boarded. Some crew members were held at gunpoint with Phillips, and others hid in an engine room.___AP writer Jason Straziuso in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.Society & CultureNavy SEALspecial operations forces

Nearly three dozen pigs were released and animal blood spilled May 14 in Nairobi as civil society activists protested what they called parliament's greedy salary demands. Police fired tear gas and swung their batons to disperse the protesters, who gathered in what was dubbed the "Occupy Parliament" protest.
