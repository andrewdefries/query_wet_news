PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — A couple who became husband and wife on the "Love Float," a surprise reunion between a returning soldier and his little boy, and a grand marshal famed globally for her chimpanzee research were among the highlights of the 124th Rose Parade on Tuesday.The parade's spectacular 42 floral floats brightened an otherwise cloudy New Year's morning and boosted the spirits of a chilled crowd estimated at some 700,000 spectators lining the 5-mile route."The only way that you're going to experience the Rose Parade is to be here in person," said Los Angeles resident Gineen Alcantara-Nakama, who camped out Monday night to save front row sidewalk spots."Growing up, I watched it on television, but it's not the same — the smell, the atmosphere, smelling the flowers as they come down the street. And the energy. It's like being with family all night long."Spectators rose to a standing ovation when Army Sgt. First Class Eric Pazz, who was riding on the Natural Balance Pet Foods float along with other service members, got off the float and walked over to his surprised wife Miriam and 4-year-old son Eric Jr., who came running out of the stands into the arms of his 32-year-old father.Miriam Pazz had been told she had won a contest to attend the parade and did not know her husband, who is deployed in Afghanistan, would be there. A native of Clio, Mich., Pazz is a highly decorated soldier who has also served in Iraq. The family, who currently lives in Germany, climbed aboard the float for the rest of the route.Cheers also went up for a Chesapeake, Va., couple who tied the knot aboard Farmers Insurance "Love Float."Gerald Sapienza and Nicole Angelillo were high school classmates who reconnected 10 years later and won the parade wedding over three other couples in a nationwide contest. They received a trip to Pasadena, a wedding gown, tuxedo, rings, marriage license fees, Rose Bowl game tickets and hair and makeup for the bride.

The parade's theme this year was "Oh the Places You'll Go!" named in honor of the Dr. Seuss book. It served as a fitting slogan for grand marshal British primatologist Jane Goodall, who has spent much of her life in Tanzania studying chimpanzees.Goodall chose conservation as her message for the parade"My dream for this New Year's Day is for everyone to think of the places we can all go if we work together to make our world a better place," said Goodall, 78."Every journey starts with a step and I am pleased to see the Tournament of Roses continue to take steps toward not only celebrating beauty and imagination, but also a cleaner environment."This year's parade also saw the first-ever float entered by the Defense Department.The $247,000 military float was a replica of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington to commemorate the veterans from that conflict.The float that scooped up the parade's grand "Sweepstakes" prize for the most beautiful floral presentation and design was "Dreaming in Paradise" by fruit and vegetable producer Dole.According to parade rules, every inch of the floats must be covered with flowers or plant material, most of it applied by volunteers in the last weeks of December.Besides floats, the parade also featured 23 marching bands and 21 equestrian units from around the world.Banda El Salvador, a 200-plus member marching band and folkloric dance troupe, played sassy Latin rhythms and paid homage to their Central American country by dressing in the national colors of blue and white and shouting "Arriba El Salvador!"The Aguiluchos band from Puebla, Mexico, earned cheers for their fancy footwork and vaquero rope tricks. Colorful dancers from Costa Rica and South Korea were other crowd pleasers.Die-hard parade fans staked out their spots overnight or in pre-dawn hours with folding chairs, hammocks and portable barbeque grills despite frosty temperatures.Emergency personnel received a number of cold-weather exposure calls, police department spokeswoman Lisa Derderian told City News Service.As of 8 a.m. Tuesday, police had made a total of 22 arrests along the parade route since 6 p.m. Monday, said police Lt. Rick Aversan. All but one arrest were for suspected public intoxication. The other was for suspected possession of burglary tools that could have been used to break into cars, police said.Cultural EventsCultural Festivals, Concerts & Shows

Measure of US home prices rises most in 6 years

WASHINGTON (AP) — A measure of U.S. home prices jumped 5 percent in September compared with a year ago, the largest year-over-year increase since July 2006. The gain reported by CoreLogic offered more evidence of a sustainable housing recovery.The real estate data provider also said Tuesday that prices declined 0.3 percent in September from August, the first drop after six straight increases. The monthly figures are not seasonally adjusted. CoreLogic says the monthly decline reflects the end of the summer home-buying season and not a softening in the housing recovery.Steady price increases should give the housing market more momentum when home sales pick up in the spring. Rising prices encourage more homeowners to sell their homes and entice would-be buyers to purchase homes before prices rise further.Other measures have also shown healthy gains in home prices over the past year. The Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller 20-city index rose 2 percent in August compared with a year ago, a faster pace than the previous month.The price gains in the past year reported by CoreLogic were widespread. Prices have risen in all but seven states. And they declined in only 18 out of 100 large cities that are tracked by the index.Some of the biggest increases were in states that suffered the worst from the housing bust. Home prices in Arizona jumped 18.7 percent in the past year, the most of any state. Home prices in Idaho rose 13.1 percent, the second largest. Nevada's home values rose 11 percent.Home prices jumped 22.1 percent in Phoenix, the metro area with the biggest gain. Prices in Houston rose 6.6 percent, the second-highest increase.The states with the biggest drops were Rhode Island (3.5 percent) and Illinois (2.3 percent).CoreLogic's price index is based on repeat sales of the same homes and tracks their price changes over time.Several reports last month showed that the housing market is improving, though from depressed levels.Home builders started construction on new homes and apartments at the fastest pace in more than four years in September. They also requested the most building permits in four years, a sign that many are confident that home sales gains will continue.New home sales jumped last month to the highest annual pace in the past two and a half years. Sales of previously occupied homes dipped in September but have risen steadily in the past year.Sales of both new and previously occupied homes are still below levels that are consistent with a healthy housing market. That's partly because the supply of available homes for sale remains low. And many prospective home buyers are struggling to qualify for a mortgage or scrape together the bigger down payments that many banks are requiring.Real EstateFinanceCoreLogic

Tentative farm workers deal in immigration talks

WASHINGTON (AP) — A tentative deal has been reached between agriculture workers and growers, a key senator said Tuesday, smoothing the way for a landmark immigration bill to be released within a week.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who's taken the lead on negotiating a resolution to the agriculture issue, didn't provide details, and said growers had yet to sign off on the agreement. The farm workers union has been at odds with the agriculture industry over worker wages and how many visas should be offered in a new program to bring agriculture workers to the U.S.But Feinstein said she's hoping for resolution in the next day or two."There's a tentative agreement on a number of things, and we're waiting to see if it can get wrapped up," Feinstein said in a brief interview at the Capitol."I'm very hopeful. The train is leaving the station. We need a bill."The development comes as a bipartisan group of senators hurries to finish legislation aimed at securing the border and putting 11 million immigrants here illegally on a path to citizenship, while also allowing tens of thousands of high- and low-skilled foreign workers into the U.S. on new visa programs. The agriculture dispute was the most prominent of a handful of unresolved issues. There's also still some debate over plans to boost visas for high-tech workers.The group of four Republican and four Democratic senators has been hoping to release the landmark immigration bill this week, possibly as early as Thursday. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a leader of the group, said Tuesday that this week remains the goal. But it also looked possible it could slip into next week.Senators in the immigration group met Tuesday with Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who agreed to hold a hearing April 17 on the legislation, Senate aides said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were confidential.

That's something Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been calling for in response to pressure from conservatives who argue the bill is being pushed too fast without enough time for debate. Given Judiciary Committee procedures that allow Republicans to push for extra time to review legislation, the committee could begin to vote on and amend the bill the week of May 6, an aide said."The Judiciary Committee must have plenty of time to debate and improve the bipartisan group's proposal, so it's good that senators and the public will have weeks to study this proposal," Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said.At least 50 percent and as much as 70 percent or 80 percent of the nation's approximately 2 million farm workers are here illegally, according to labor and industry estimates. Growers say they need a better way to hire labor legally, and advocates say workers can be exploited and need better protections and a way to earn permanent residence.Senators plan to offer a speeded-up pathway to citizenship to farm workers already in the country illegally who've worked in the industry for at least two years. In addition they're seeking to create a new visa program to bring foreign agriculture workers to the U.S. But wages and visa caps have been sticking points, just as they were for a separate low-skilled worker program that was resolved recently with a deal between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO.After negotiations between the United Farm Workers and agriculture interests, including the Western Growers Association, stalled in recent weeks, the four senators working on the issue — Feinstein, Rubio, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah — developed a framework that would ultimately call for the agriculture secretary to set visa levels and wages, according to officials involved in the talks.But the uncertainty of that structure sparked concern on both sides, and talks between growers and agriculture reopened. There now have been numbers set for wages and where to cap visa levels that the United Farm Workers has agreed to, officials said, although details weren't immediately available Tuesday. But growers emphasized they had yet to sign off."We are working diligently on the final details on the important details of the wage and cap and are hopeful, but have not agreed to anything," said Kristi Boswell, director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.Even in absence of a formal OK from the growers side, Feinstein suggested that the senators were satisfied and would be moving forward with what they've settled on."We hope we can get their acquiescence and support, otherwise we just need to proceed ahead," she said.Meanwhile there were indications that the immigration debate, largely confined to behind-the-scenes negotiations so far, was moving into a more public phase.Pro-immigrant groups planned rallies around the country and outside the Capitol for Wednesday.And there was back-and-forth among GOP-leaning groups over the expected cost of a bill, with a conservative think tank, the American Action Forum, releasing a report Tuesday arguing that immigration reform would grow the economy and reduce the deficit, partly because of growth in the labor force. That stood in contrast to a report by the Heritage Foundation released during the last immigration debate in 2007, and expected to be revived again this year, that contended the legislation cost taxpayers $2.6 trillion.The dispute was more evidence of a split in the GOP, with some favoring comprehensive immigration legislation, and others still strongly opposed.___Follow Erica Werner on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ericawernerPolitics & GovernmentImmigration IssuesDianne Feinsteinimmigration bill

This June 26, 2013 photo provided by Gunnar Boettcher shows a rabbit that Boettcher dubbed "Frankenstein" with what looks like a series of horns growing out of its head outside his home in Mankato, Minn. Boettcher and his brother put together a video entitled "The World's Scariest Rabbit," which has attracted thousands of Internet viewers. Boettcher thinks the rabbit might have a papilloma virus that's a form of cancer. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources spokesperson says he suspects that is what it is, as it's not an uncommon ailment in rabbits, but he's not seen it on the top of the head.

MANKATO, Minn. (AP) — A southern Minnesota college student's spoof video of an apparently tumorous rabbit that he dubbed "Frankenstein" has attracted hundreds of thousands of Internet viewers.Gunnar Boettcher, a 20-year-old student at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, and his brother took photos and video of the rabbit, which looks to have tumors growing on its head, on June 26."We've seen it before around the house but we've never been able to get a close look," Boettcher said. "But we went over to him that day and he didn't run away like he normally does."In the video, entitled "The World's Scariest Rabbit," Boettcher speaks in an Australian accent, imitating the late crocodile hunter Steve Irwin.Boettcher put it on Facebook, and a friend of his posted it to Reddit. Within four days, more than 200,000 people had watched, according to The Free Press of Mankato (http://bit.ly/1acdwVx)Boettcher last saw the rabbit Wednesday night. He thinks it might have a papilloma virus that's a form of cancer.Joe Stangel, area wildlife supervisor for the state Department Natural Resources, said he also suspects that is what it is but is waiting for confirmation from a veterinarian. It's not an uncommon ailment in rabbits, Stangel said, but he's not seen it on the top of the head.It's generally a fatal ailment, Stangel said, noting the DNR would just let nature take its course.Some of the video comments haven't been particularly kind to Boettcher. Some say it's wrong to get a few laughs from a disease that certainly will kill the animal. Others say he has a responsibility to get it some veterinary help.Boettcher disagrees."It's a great idea to try to help him and make him healthy again, but it's a little ridiculous to blame me for not helping the rabbit and taking him to the vet when it's a wild rabbit," he said. "It's turning into a thing on animal rights ... it was just supposed to be something fun between me and my brother."___Online:Rabbit video: http://youtu.be/hgm61LJEwqE___Information from: The Free Press, http://www.mankatofreepress.comGustavus Adolphus College
