10 Amazingly Dumb Things We Do with Smartphones
Smartphones are getting smarter all the time, but the people using them aren't necessarily doing so. Today, we have devices at our disposal that snap photos faster than you can blink, surf the Web at speeds that make your home broadband jealous and download apps that can do everything and anything. So why are we so dumb sometimes when it comes to using these powerful pocket-size computers? If you do any of these 10 things with your smartphone on a regular basis, you probably don’t deserve to own one.	Obsessively Take and Share Pictures of Food	Hey, look at this chocolate cream pie I made! And these kung pao chicken tacos! And don’t forget my blueberry limoncello cooler! I love food as much as the next guy — in fact, "Restaurant: Impossible" is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. But I just don’t get this obsession with taking photos of eats and sharing them with Facebook and Instagram friends. The only time I want to stare at pictures of food is right before I order it off of a menu.	More: 10 Best Android Smartphones	Try to Settle Arguments via Texting	I don’t know when this happened, but at some point humans thought it was a good idea to text a loved one or friend with their anger or disappointment instead of actually talking to them. Yes, sending a text is easier, but you lose two very critical ingredients: context and tone. (No, emoticons don’t count as tone.) I’ve seen way too many seemingly innocuous exchanges devolve into digital shouting matches over a texting misunderstanding. Hey, you could always Skype video call to apologize so they know you mean it.	More: Top 10 Unfriendable Mistakes	Use Your Smartphone as a Lighter at a Concert	The first time I saw thousands of people use their phones at a Coldplay concert as a lighter replacement I thought to myself, “That’s cute.” Five years later, I think it’s time to move on. Today, you can download all sorts of apps that look like real lighters, including a Zippo lighter that opens with a flick of your wrist and a turn of your thumb. How meta! I would rather you blow cigarette smoke in my face than witness this display of mass stupidity.

10 Amazingly Dumb Things We Do with Smartphones
More: 15 Craziest iPhone Cases	Take Too Many Selfies (Duck Face Included)	Part of me wishes that front-facing cameras on smartphones were never invented. That’s because way too many people feel the need to take self-portraits and share them with the world. “Look at me out with my friends drinking — again!” You know the type. For these people, the smartphone should be smart enough to cap how many selfies they take. Siri: “That’s enough, Jenny. They get it.” And while we’re on the subject, please avoid taking selfies with your duck face on. Even as an ironic gesture, it’s over.	More: How to Take the Perfect Profile Picture	Use Your Phone as a Boombox in a Public Space	Today’s smartphones can get pretty darn loud — the HTC One’s dual stereo speakers come to mind. In fact, a commercial for the phone has some hipsters rocking out to the device in the middle of a cafe (or bar, I can’t tell). The problem is that no human being should ever do that, unless your goal is to annoy everyone else around you.	I’ve seen lots of people in New York City use their smartphones as mini boomboxes, not realizing how disturbing it can be to others. Unless you’re John Cusack from "Say Anything," plug in headphones. Actually, him too.	More: 12 Best Music Apps View gallery
10 Amazingly Dumb Things We Do with Smartphones
Taking Calls or Incessantly Checking Phone in Elevator	Think about how long you typically spend on an elevator ride, even if there’s a few stops along the way. We’re talking 20, or maybe as many as 40, seconds. And yet, as a society, we’ve become so averse to eye contact and real human interaction that we’d rather stare at the same inbox or Facebook news feed that’s waiting for us five feet from the elevator door.	Worse, some of us make the horrible decision to continue a call as we get on the elevator, making the obligatory announcement that “I may lose you; I’m getting on an elevator.” I have a better idea. Wait!	More: 10 Best iPhone Apps You're Not Using	Shooting Videos in Portrait Mode	I literally cringe every time I see someone shoot a smartphone video vertically instead of horizontally. “Don’t you know that your video is going to look cut off?” I say to myself. A lot of folks just don’t know any better, but there’s hope. A hilarious PSA video started circulating last summer from Laughing Squid that clearly illustrates the problem using puppets. Even if you know how to shoot video the right way, you need to watch this clip.	More: The New Smartphone War: 7 Apple and Samsung Challengers Use Apple Maps for the iPhone	As much as I appreciate finally having free turn-by-turn directions on the iPhone, Apple’s Maps app should not be your go-to choice. For starters, you need to use a third-party app to get public transit directions, like Waze or Google Maps. The app also still suffers from serious inaccuracies. When I searched for Brio Tuscan Grille in my hometown of Freehold, N.J., Apple Maps displayed a location on Route 9, while Google Maps accurately showed the restaurant in the area mall.	Here's another annoyance. Oftentimes Apple Maps doesn't know where you are. For instance, after searching 550 Fifth Avenue while in New York City, the first search result that appeared in a list was in River Edge, NJ. Unless you like starting at fancy 3D flyovers, I would stick to Google Maps until Apple can work out the kinks.	More: Top 10 Apple Maps Alternatives Smartphoning While Walking	Would you ever walk across a busy intersection with your head down if you didn’t have a smartphone in your hand? If you answered “no,” congratulations, you’re sane. So why is it OK to risk your life just to like your friend’s snarky comment about Gwyneth Paltrow’s see-through dress? Fortunately, some folks are working on litigating some common sense into your brain. Fort Lee, N.J., issued a ban against texting while cross the street, and Nevada has introduced a similar bill.	More: Why Texting While Walking is More Dangerous Than You Think	Keep Notification Volume on Full Blast All the Freakin’ Time	I totally feel you. You don’t want to miss that critical tweet about the latest “Man of Steel” trailer. But when you’re heading into an important meeting, the last thing your colleagues want to hear is “DROID” screaming from your phone or that damn Samsung whistle coming from your Galaxy. Do the world a favor and drill into your settings and do what needs to be done. Or I’m going to hunt you down and turn it off myself. Unless I’m using Apple Maps. Then you’re safe.

Immigrant tuition debate challenges Arizona policy
Colleges offering reduced tuition to some immigrants in challenge to Arizona benefits ban

PHOENIX (AP) -- Efforts to allow immigrants without legal status to pay lower tuition rates have pitted Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne against higher education leaders. The Maricopa County Community College District decided Tuesday to uphold a new policy allowing young immigrants participating in the Obama administration's deferred deportation program to pay in-state tuition rates despite warnings from Horne that it violates state law. "Our position is the same, and that is that we are obeying the law," district spokesman Tom Gariepy said in a phone interview. "We feel pretty confident that our interpretation of the law is correct." A spokeswoman for Horne said Wednesday he has not made a decision to legally challenge the district's policy at this time, but could move forward as soon as Thursday. Meanwhile, the Arizona Board of Regents has directed its legal staff to find a way to lower tuition rates for these students without violating state law. A proposal is expected in June. The regents have not reached out to Horne's office for legal guidelines, spokeswoman Sarah Harper said. "They would definitely be making sure that any options would be within the perimeters of the law," Harper said. Under state law, immigrants without lawful status do not qualify for public benefits, including in-state tuition rates. But the law doesn't define what constitutes a legal resident. Gov. Jan Brewer has said youth in the Obama administration program do not have lawful status. Immigrants protected under the new Obama policy must be younger than 30 and must have come to the U.S. before they turned 16. Roughly 80,000 immigrants in Arizona are eligible, according to state estimates. The Maricopa County Community College District adopted its reduced tuition program in September. Gariepy would not say whether the school is prepared to defend its policy in court. "We would cross that bridge when we come to it," he said. At least 13 states allow immigrants who have lived in the country for many years without legal status to pay in-state tuition. Company Legal & Law MattersPolitics & GovernmentArizona Board of Regents

Matthew McConaughey & Lance Armstrong at the starting line for the Nike Human Race on August 31, 2008 in Austin, Texas -- Getty Premium
Texas natives Matthew McConaughey and Lance Armstrong have long been buddies (who can forget those photos of the two of them jogging shirtless together?). So has the actor spoken to his friend following Lance's two-night bombshell sit-down with Oprah?Access Hollywood's Tim Vincent caught up with Matthew at the premiere of his new film, "Mud," at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where the 43-year-old star revealed he has indeed talked to Lance following the doping confession and said the athlete is doing well. PLAY IT NOW: Matthew McConaughey On His Extreme Weight Loss: ‘It Wasn’t Really As Hard As People Thought It Was’ PHOTOS: Hollywood's Hottest Dads & Their Little Ones While Matthew seems to be in a good place with Lance now, in an interview with MTV News on Saturday, he admitted he initially was very angry when he learned the seven-time Tour de France champion had cheated. VIEW THE PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Hottest Beach Bodies — The Guys! "My first reaction was I was pissed off. I was mad," he told MTV, adding that he wanted to be "delicate" in how he spoke regarding the scandal. "I then got kind of sad for him. First off, I had a part of me that took it kind of personally, which I think a lot of people have."After giving the situation serious thought, Matthew said he realized he shouldn't take the lies as a personal affront."What I mean by this is, what was he supposed to do? Call me to the side and go, 'Hey man, I did it but don't tell anybody.' Then I would have really had a reason to be pissed off at him, going, 'You want me to walk around holding this?'" he said. "Where I am now is I've put myself out of the way and I am happy for this guy, who has now chosen to reenter this new chapter of his life a truly free man. VIEW THE PHOTOS: Lance Armstrong Adding, "And the weight he had on his shoulders, without the boogieman under the bed, the skeleton in the closet that he's carried for 14 years. Fourteen years he lied and carried the lie with him."PHOTOS: Hollywood's Hottest Beach Bods -- The Guys! VIEW THE PHOTOS: Hollywood Dads & Their Adorable Little Ones! Matthew agreed with what Oprah said multiple times during the shocking interview, which is that finally telling the truth will liberate Lance, but said he believes it will be a long, painful and humbling road."Oprah said the other night, 'The truth will set you free,' but she forgot one part. It's miserable in the beginning. And it's going to be miserable," he said. "But he's looking it in the eye, and he'll handle it. He'll deal. And he's ready for how hard it's going to be to deal." -- Erin O'Sullivan Copyright 2013 by NBC Universal, Inc. All rights reserved.

Oct 1, 2013; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Cincinnati Reds manager Dusty Baker (12) is introduced before National …
(Reuters) - The Cincinnati Reds have fired manager Dusty Baker, the club announced on Friday three days after the team was eliminated from the postseason in the National League wild card playoff game by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Baker, who managed Cincinnati for six seasons, had led the Reds to the playoffs three of the past four years but each time failed to clear their first hurdle. "This was a very difficult decision to make," said president of baseball operations and general manager Walt Jocketty, who said he informed Baker during a meeting at Great American Ball Park on Thursday. "Dusty played an important role in the recent success of this organization, and we thank him for his contributions during his time here. We feel a change is necessary, however, if we are to continue to move the organization forward." Baker, who managed the San Francisco Giants to the National League pennant in 2002 and directed the Chicago Cubs to the NL Central Division title in 2003, steered the Reds to NL Central titles in 2010 and 2012. Last year, the Reds won the first two games of their Division Series in San Francisco before getting swept at home by the Giants, who went on to win the World Series. He compiled a record of 509-463 record for the Reds, who stumbled toward the end of the 2013 season and were swept in the final three games at home by the Pirates to finish at 90-72 before losing to Pittsburgh in the wild card showdown. Reactions from Reds players garnered by the Cincinnati Enquirer showed they were expecting some fallout from their poor finish. "I thought someone was going to get fired, but I didn't know who," said starting pitcher Bronson Arroyo, who will be a free agent following the World Series. "I'm surprised it was him. I had a conversation with him two days ago and if it was coming, he didn't know it. He was talking about his plans for next season and he was worried about his coaches." Reliever Sam LeCure said he was not surprised. "Unfortunately, it's not like (CEO) Mr. (Bob) Castellini can fire all of the players," LeCure said. "I think it's more like him trying to send a message that the culture of the clubhouse had to change. "I think it was a time for a change with some of the personalities." Outfielder Jay Bruce said Baker deserved credit for putting the Reds on the right path. "I understand that it's a business and when teams don't accomplish what's expected of them there are changes, but any way you slice it, Dusty was an integral part of turning the organization around," Bruce wrote in an email. "The Cincinnati Reds became relevant again with Dusty at the helm, and that's something people should never forget." The 64-year-old Baker, a former major league outfielder who began his managerial career in 1993 with the Giants, is ranked 16th all-time and second among active managers with 1,671 wins, and three times was named Manager of the Year. Baker guided his teams to seven postseasons, including the 2002 World Series with the Giants, who lost to the Angels in seven games.

RICO presents challenges in Atlanta cheating case

ATLANTA (AP) — The criminal prosecution of dozens of Atlanta Public Schools educators presents considerable challenges for both prosecutors and defense attorneys because of the use of a complex law initially designed to dismantle organized crime, legal experts say.Thirty-five educators within the Atlanta school system, including former Superintendent Dr. Beverly Hall, were named in a 65-count indictment last week that alleges a broad conspiracy to cheat, conceal cheating or retaliate against whistleblowers in an effort to bolster student test scores and, as a result, receive bonuses for improved student performance. Prosecutors set a Tuesday deadline for all defendants to surrender to authorities.Jail spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said that no defendants had been able to turn themselves in as of late Monday afternoon because of a delay in the filing of the arrest warrants in the case, though the warrants were filed later in the evening. At least a few had planned to surrender Monday.Each defendant is charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, also known as RICO. The law is modeled on the federal statute, which Congress enacted in 1970 to take down mobsters.Criminal RICO cases can be extremely complex with multiple elements to prove beyond the basic crime. That includes establishing a criminal enterprise, in this case the Atlanta Public Schools system, and a pattern of criminal behavior."It gets very complicated when you try to describe all of this to a jury and to convince a jury that a person is guilty of all of this by a reasonable doubt," said Jeffrey E. Grell, a former assistant attorney general in Minnesota and expert on RICO cases. "Particularly in a RICO case, because you have people pointing fingers of blame all over, I'm sure it's going to be very complicated."Grell, who teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the inherent nature of the law — to prosecute "people who don't get their hands dirty" — also makes it a challenge to secure a conviction. Although the defendant doesn't have to engage in the crime directly, prosecutors must show the defendant was directly operating or managing the criminal enterprise, Grell said."The critical issue is going to be intent," Grell said. "All of these defendants, the prosecution will have to prove they knowingly and intentionally set out to defraud and engage in cheating. I'm sure some of these administrators and defendants will say they did not know what was going on."Grell said RICO cases can be expensive, especially with multiple defendants and multiple allegations of criminal wrongdoing.The defendants include high-level administrators, principals, assistant principals, teachers, testing coordinators, a school secretary and a school improvement specialist. Hall, the former superintendent, has long denied any knowledge of the cheating.A 2011 state investigation revealed widespread cheating by nearly 180 educators in Atlanta schools dating back to 2001. Investigators said educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in, and teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation, creating a culture of "fear and intimidation."The tests were the key measure the state used to determine whether it met the federal No Child Left Behind law. Schools with good test scores get extra federal dollars to spend in the classroom or on teacher bonuses.On Friday, in announcing the indictment, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard used the story of an Atlanta third-grader to underscore the importance of the case, with teachers and administrators more focused on test scores than student improvement. He said the girl received the worst score in her reading class in 2006 and yet, when she took an assessment test, she passed with flying colors. The girl is now in ninth grade, reading at a fifth-grade level.The high emotions surrounding the case and the extensive media publicity will also pose challenges for prosecutors and defense attorneys.It's likely that one or more defendants will seek to have the case moved out of Atlanta or to have jurors brought in from another part of the state, which is allowed under Georgia law, said Ron Carlson, professor of law emeritus at the University of Georgia. Some of the defendants may also ask to have their trials be separate from the others in the hopes of strengthening their case, Carlson said.And the stakes will increase the pressure on everyone involved in the case."I consider this one of the most important, one of the seminal developments in the history of American education law. It's the largest school teaching scandal yet recorded in the country," Carlson said. "A high-profile case like this one puts public attention and public pressure on the various moves made by prosecutors and defense attorneys."Morgan Cloud, a professor at Emory University School of Law, said prosecutors will also have to work to explain the RICO law to jurors."When we think of racketeers we think of the Gambino family in New York ... people who engage in murder and drug dealing and prostitution," Cloud said.___Follow Christina Almeida Cassidy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/AP_Christina.Politics & GovernmentCrime & JusticeAtlanta Public Schools
