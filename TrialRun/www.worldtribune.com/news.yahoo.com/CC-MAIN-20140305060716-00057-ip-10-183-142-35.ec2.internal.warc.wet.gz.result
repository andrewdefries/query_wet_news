Robert Griffin was placed on waivers Thursday.	But it's not that Robert Griffin, though he was a 2012 draft pick from Baylor, just like the former Heisman Trophy winner and Washington Redskins star quarterback.	This Robert Griffin was let go by the Indianapolis Colts, who had signed him to a futures contract back on New Year's Day. He was a 2012 sixth-round draft choice of the New York Jets.	The move with Griffin was one of several moves made by the Colts, who also signed undrafted free agent guard Danous Estenor, signed free agent center Thomas Austin and waived-injured inside linebacker Scott Lutrus. If Lutrus clears waivers, he will revert to the Colts’ Injured Reserve list.
