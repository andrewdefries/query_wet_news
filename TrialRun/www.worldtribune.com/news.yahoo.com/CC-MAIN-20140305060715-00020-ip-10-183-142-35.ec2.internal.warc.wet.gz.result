DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Seems Dubai police have a thing for Italian speed: They're making preparations to have a nearly $250,000 Ferrari join an even pricier Lamborghini as the flagship flash of its fleet. Photos carried Wednesday by the Emirates 24/7 online newspaper show the car getting the green-and-white colors of Dubai's police force. Earlier this week, Dubai's police chief, Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim, said the Ferrari was on the way. Dubai plans to have the two ultra-cars roll through tourist zones in yet another expression of the city's endless pursuit of glitz. Next up? Police say they are working on converting the classic American muscle car Camaro model into a fleet of regular squad cars. Last week Dubai police unveiled a nearly $550,000 Lamborghini Aventador.

Behind the New York Times pay wall, you only get 10 free clicks a month. For those worried about hitting their limit, we're taking a look through the paper each morning to find the stories that can make your clicks count.RELATED: The Republican National Convention, Ryanomics, and K-pop Top Stories: Though his written teachings were praised, Pope Benedict XVI "often appeared to carom from one crisis to the next" when facing real-life challenges. RELATED: Afghanistan Casualties, 'Call Me Maybe,' and Michael J. Fox World: Allegations of sexual harassment by Joshu Sasaki, an influential Buddhist teacher, has "upset and obsessed Zen Buddhists across the country, who are part of a close-knit world in which many participants seem to know, or at least know of, the principal teachers." RELATED: Seattle Cops on Twitter, Skulls, and Hunting U.S.: At the State of the Union Washington will also be looking to see the "the state of Barack Obama."RELATED: Obama's Modern Liberalism, Sasha and Malia, and Social-Media Spies at Work New York: In communities still trapped by snow residents turned to plowing the roads themselves and using mass transit. RELATED: Violence in China, Barbra Streisand, and the Nationals Business: A Japanese television series about a company that "turns to advanced lithium-ion" is all too real for the country. Technology: Though the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program is supposed to bring Internet to places private companies deemed too expensive, it is now being characterized as wasteful. Science: Benedict Carey takes a look at the research on video games and violence, some of which "has begun to clarify what can and cannot be said about the effects of violent gaming." Sports: Holding the breed judging for Westminster at Piers 92/94 added a new hiccup to the competition: "crosstown dog schlepping on a rainy day." Opinion: James Martin on Benedict XVI's resignation and legacy. Music: An interview with Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music, whose The Jazz Age re-imagines some of his most famous songs "in the style of 1920s jazz."Arts & EntertainmentMediaPope Benedict XVIBarack Obama
