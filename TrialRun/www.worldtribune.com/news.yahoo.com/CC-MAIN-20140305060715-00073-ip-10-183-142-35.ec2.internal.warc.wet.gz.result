Tight end Owen Daniels is out for at least one month with a fractured fibula, but might miss just three games as the Houston Texans' bye week falls on Oct. 27. Daniels is the team's second-leading receiver with 24 receptions and is tied for the team lead with three touchdowns. Houston has lost three games in a row since a 2-0 start. Coach Gary Kubiak prefers to use multiple tight ends in the base offense. Garrett Graham, a fourth-round pick in 2010, has three touchdown receptions this season and will be elevated to the No. 1 tight end role with Daniels sidelined. Rookie sixth-round pick Ryan Griffin would likely start if the Texans continue with two-tight end sets.Sports & RecreationAmerican FootballOwen DanielsHouston Texans
