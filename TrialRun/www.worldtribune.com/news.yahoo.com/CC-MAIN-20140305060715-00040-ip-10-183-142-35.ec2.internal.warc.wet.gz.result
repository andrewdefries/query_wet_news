MIAMI (AP) -- Garrett Jones will try to give the Miami Marlins some much-needed offense at first base.Jones agreed to terms with Miami on a $7.75 million, two-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations said Monday. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal hadn't been finalized and Jones had yet to take his physical.Jones, a six-year veteran, spent the past four seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He's a career .254 hitter with 102 home runs and has played in at least 144 games each of the past four years.Marlins first basemen were last in the majors at that position with 10 home runs and a .344 slugging percentage in 2013.Jones, who will make $2.75 million in 2014 and $5 million in 2015, joins a Marlins lineup that has changed considerably in the past week. The team signed catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia to a $21 million, three-year deal, while infielder Rafael Furcal signed a $3 million, one-year deal and is expected to play second base.The lineup needed a shakeup after Miami finished last in the majors this year in runs, home runs, batting, slugging and on-base percentage.The addition of Jones puts Marlins first baseman Logan Morrison firmly on the trade block. He has battled injuries the past two seasons and hit .242 with six homers in 85 games in 2013.Jones, a left-handed hitter, batted .233 with 15 homers and 51 RBIs in 144 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates this year. He lost his starting job late in the season and batted only twice in the playoffs.In 2012 Jones batted .274 with a career-high 27 homers and 86 RBIs.Sports & RecreationBaseballMiami MarlinsGarrett Jones
