Could John Stamos be the latest former resident of Port Charles to return to "General Hospital," which is gearing up to celebrate its 50th birthday this April on ABC?On Tuesday night, the actor posted two photos to his Instagram account that appear to have been taken where the show is shot in Los Angeles. But, according to the captions, the actor, who played Blackie Parrish in the early 1980s, was just "visiting."

John's character, Blackie, and Genie's Laura, have a connection in the "GH" world. Laura's mom and dad fostered Blackie, but the troubled youth - who had a rock band - Blackie and the Riff Raff (with singer Frisco Jones) - was involved in the death of a character and he ended up going to prison.Blackie likely would have served his time by now and be out.
