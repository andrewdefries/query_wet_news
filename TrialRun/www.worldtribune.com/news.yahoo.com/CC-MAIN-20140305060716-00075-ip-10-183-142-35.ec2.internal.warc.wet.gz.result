LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The AAA says gas prices in Arkansas have gone up 17 cents in the past week. The average price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline in Arkansas is $3.34 as of Monday. A week ago, the price was $3.17 per gallon. The Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers area reported the highest average price among the state's metropolitan areas, at $3.37 per gallon. The national average is $3.52 per gallon. Officials say retail prices in the central United States have risen the most dramatically as a result of an increase in the costs of products used by refiners that supply the region. Arkansas' record high for gasoline is $3.97 per gallon, set in July 2008. unleaded gasolineArkansas
