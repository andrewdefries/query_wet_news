An American Airlines plane takes off at LAX International airport in Los Angeles Monday, April 22, 2013. Some fliers headed to Los Angeles International Airport were met with delays yesterday on the first day of staffing cuts for air traffic controllers because of government spending reductions. Budget cuts that kicked in last month forced the FAA to give controllers extra days off. Commercial airline flights moved smoothly throughout most of the country on Sunday, April 21, 2013, the first day air traffic controllers were subject to furloughs resulting from government spending cuts, though some delays appeared in the late evening in and around New York.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Congressional Budget Office says a sweeping immigration bill before the Senate would cut deficits by $197 billion over 10 years.The bill would add $262 billion in new spending and tax credits over 10 years, a sum more than covered by $459 billion in increased revenues, according to the report Tuesday by Congress' nonpartisan scorekeepers.The bill would cut deficits by an additional $700 billion in the second 10 years after taking effect, CBO says.Some 8 million people in the U.S. illegally would initially gain legal status under the legislation, according to the CBO analysis. That's compared with a population of about 11 million immigrants now in the country illegally.Politics & GovernmentGovernmentCongressional Budget Office

Why cancer-identifying apps aren't ready for prime time

The result screen that appears on your phone after being diagnosed by the SkinVision app.
Of four popular smartphone applications used to ID melanoma, only one passed the testThe premise is promising, at least on paper: You use your smartphone to quickly snap a photo of a questionable mole or skin lesion. Next, an algorithm or anonymous, board-certified dermatologist scans it for tell-tale signs of melanoma — things like size, asymmetry, an irregular border, or odd color. The intent is to assuage any fears a person might have about that strange thing they have growing on them, potentially steering them towards the correct course of treatment, if necessary. But a new study that analyzes popular cancer-identifying apps says that only one is reliably accurate in most cases. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine used photos of 188 moles, some confirmed with melanoma, to test four apps. Three are free (or close to free) and use algorithms. The fourth, which costs $5 per photo and has a 24-hour turnaround, beams the photo to a dermatologist. SEE ALSO: Gross but effective: How fecal transplants trump traditional antibioticsThe dermatologist app, SkinVision, correctly identified suspicious moles 98 percent of the time. The other, algorithm-based applications missed melanomas 30 percent of the time, which is worrisome for a treatable skin disease that relies on early detection.These pre-screening tools could be giving people a "false sense of security," study co-author Laura Ferris told NPR. While these apps have good intentions, at this point the technology is "not good enough to trust your life with."
