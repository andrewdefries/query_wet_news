Did some work early which took its toll late nose 2nd (58.5) Dynamic Jack 1200m Sunshine Coast C1 Jan 6. Lost no admirers last time and had the wow factor about him at debut.

Can unleash a blistering finish when she's on song. Firmer going will suit even better. Represents value.

- 10 9 Good Comment:Made up ground 2-1/4 len 4th (55.5) Tamamushi 1100m Toowoomba Cushion C1 Dec 15. Rounded them up and powered clear 7-1/4 len win (55.0) Are Tee Ess, Rhiatenn Road 1200m Toowoomba Cushion C1 Jan 5. Question marks on strength of opposition he beat last time but did it with plenty of authority. Turf form when last in work wasn't flash. Has to be taken on trust on that basis.
