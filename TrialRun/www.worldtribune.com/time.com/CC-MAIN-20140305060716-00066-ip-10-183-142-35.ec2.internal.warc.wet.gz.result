Given Imaging
FDA approval of pill-sized camera clears way for less-painful option to screen the health of your colon The FDA gave a pill-sized camera that can replace colonoscopies the green light on Monday.
The PillCam Colon from Given Imaging contains a battery-operated camera that, once swallowed, takes pictures of its journey through the body. The images are sent to a device the patient wears around the waist, and doctors can later review the photos, the Associated Press reports.
The FDA approved the device for people who struggle with traditional colonoscopies, which typically consist of the doctor inserting a long and thin flexible tube with a small camera up through the large intestine. About 750,000 Americans are unable to complete their colonoscopy each year due to issues related to disease or anatomy, the AP reports.
Here’s to less poking and prodding.
