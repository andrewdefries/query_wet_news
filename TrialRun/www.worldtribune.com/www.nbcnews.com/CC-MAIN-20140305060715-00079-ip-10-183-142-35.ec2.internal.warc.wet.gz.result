>>>
and good evening. once again from cairo, where today the atmosphere suddenly turned sour and toxic and is still disintegrating tonight, turning into a rock and molotov cocktail
fight with open fires burning in front of the museum where 5,000 years of egyptian history
is housed. it started unusually, the day did, with new groups of protesters in different clusters we hadn't seen before. it was readily apparent they were supporting hosni mubarak
. it became clear later many of them were gangs of street thugs assembled for the occasion. some of them came in on horses, some of them came in on camels. and they were insurgents cutting through the lines of protesters who camped out and staked their home in the city square
for days, making an inroad for the other side of this protest. tonight the night air
is still on occasion crackling with gunfire from automatic weapons, small caliber and large. they have turned that square
into an open human combat space. the number of injured starts conservative -- see a lot from the fight with the light of day
. bordering on that square
, not far from our location here tonight we can candidly smell the smoke from the fires here. our own richard
engle has been covering it all day with us. richard
, good evening.
>> reporter: good evening, brian
. clashes are continuing between protesters and supporters of president mubarak
. here in tahrir
square
, fires have broken out as the two sides exchanged molotov cocktails
. for now it appears the protesters have the upper hand. president mubarak
proved he will not go down without a fight. egypt ordered a crackdown against anti-government demonstrators, but not with troops, tanks or uniformed police. instead, it sent in goon squads disguised as supporters of president mubarak
. it was immediately clear these were not demonstrators. thousands of mubarak
supporters charged into cairo's tahrir
square
. the protesters unarmed were caught off guard by the surprise attack
