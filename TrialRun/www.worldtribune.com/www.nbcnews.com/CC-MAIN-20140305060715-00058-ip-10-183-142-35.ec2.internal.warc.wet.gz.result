Animals carcasses lay on the ground March 23, four days after they were killed by what residents said was a chemical weapon attack in the Khan al-Assal area, near the northern city of Aleppo. The United Nations said it would investigate Syria's allegations that rebel forces used chemical weapons in the attack near Aleppo, but Western countries sought a probe of all claims concerning the use of such banned arms. The deaths of 26 people in that rocket attack became the focus of competing claims from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's supporters and opponents, who accuse each other of firing a missile laden with chemicals.
