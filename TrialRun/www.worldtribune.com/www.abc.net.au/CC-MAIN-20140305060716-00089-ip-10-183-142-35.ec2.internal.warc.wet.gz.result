Last Goodbye
Jeff Buckley
AuthorsJeff Buckley
ReleasedAugust 23, 1994 on Grace LP
Produced byJeff Buckley, Andy Wallace
Recorded atBearsville Recording Studio, Woodstock, NY
“It all pretty much comes from the heart, your base desire,” Jeff Buckley mused on his songwriting, stopping by triple j during his second Australian tour in February ’96. “I also think my writing has been epic because it’s probably because I don’t know how to write songs!”
First titled ‘Unforgiven’, the track was one of Buckley’s few original songs that he’d play at the Sin-e, a small club in New York’s Lower East Side, where the California-raised singer now called home. Buckley would add the newly titled ‘Last Goodbye’ to his 1994 debut album Grace, in the studio with Nirvana producer Andy Wallace, and it’d serve as the album’s only official single.
‘Last Goodbye’ resonated widely. It was Buckley’s most commercially successful song, coming in at No.14 in ’95’s Hottest 100. It also became all the more poignant with Buckley’s death on May 29, ’97, lost to the Mississippi River, aged 30.
“His music was about finding love, losing love, understanding love, getting love – it’s all about the passion of life,” Jeff’s mother Mary Guibert told Richard Kingsmill. But perhaps it was Buckley who offered the greatest insight into the power of his music: “You really have nothing to lose, and that’s the way I live my life: what could possibly happen?”

Anyone who thinks he was boring has no idea. He was quite a party animal. We met in Canberra one night in the bar below the asylum and we stayed up most of the night. It was wild. He was an amazing guy.

Many people forget what an incredible guitar player jeff buckley was, i've even heard people who witnessed his live show say his guitar playing was unforgettable, not many people are aware of that.

you can say whatever you like about jeff buckley, but the fact of the matter is that those who get him are absolutely infatuated with him. that's why he made it in twice, because his fans are so passionate. and it must take a pretty special musician to inspire that kind of response from so many people.

Apparently he swam better than he sang. I guess that's why he drowned.

funny comment but rather incorrect. Bar Maynard James he would be the best singer in this poll.

JJJ..... FAAAAAAAAAARK!! I really do like Jeff Buckley's music, but geez, two songs in the top ten!! thank god for community radio at least they still deliver fresh and exciting music. I've tried to listen to this Hot 100 with an un-biased approach, but JJJ really does sound like alternative commercial radio. For many years I have listened less and less and I fear that the end is in sight. Im 32 and after hearing this countdown, Im just sad- soooooooooo many songs were left out and I just dont get the love affair with Jeff Buckley. Sure, he was good and he kinda reminds me a bit of Rodriguez- good lyrics and music, one great album, only really famous in Australia and then no more work of any substantial merrit...uuuuugh, anyway!!

I'm so sick of hearing complaints about Triple J's hottest 100! WE voted in it, so WE are the reason the results are as they are... nothing to do with Triple J being biased. And Jeff Buckley's music is epic. Sure there are other songs that I could easily exchange but we could only pick our top 10. I personally left out some of my favourite songs because there just wasn't room for them. So it isn't the 'definitive' hottest 100. It's just a selection of songs given in order of how many times people remembered or favoured them. If it were to be cast side by side with an alternative station or extra opportunity to vote then the results could be very different! Stress less, papa`.

people saying oh he's only in the countdown because he died his music really isn't that good wake up. the only good thing that his death (as opposed to being alive and still recording) has done to music is he can now give the g-man up there singing lessons so he can teach the world in his own little way, absolute legend.

Totally agree with all those whos comments say they are a little surprised at how often Mr Buckley featured...yeah the guy had a fantastic voice and was no doubt a talent...but to feature so prominently in this list is a bit of a stretch. Plus...lets be honest..he was a bit boring wasnt he?? Go on, admit it...i wont tell if u wont. One has to wonder if he hadnt decided to take that badly timed late night dip whether he wouldve been elevated to the almost god-like status him and his one (admittedly good, but hardly GENIUS) album have been...but hey...whatever floats ur boat.

totally agree reg, Buckley is dull. doesn't deserve to have 4 songs in the count down and certainly not 2 in the top ten.

truly jeff buckley is just awfully dreary - really a tragedy but didn't want any more records from him. maybe he could have become a soap star. would suit the overblown wailing irritation his music is

how many damn Jeff Buckley and Radiohead song's do you need in the hottest one hundred of ALL TIME. Triple J listeners need to start to listen to more than 5 albums...
