ANNE KRUGER: It's almost five years since an exotic disease ripped the heart out of central Queensland's citrus industry and undermined confidence in Australia's plant-quarantine system.No-one has ever been held accountable for the citrus canker outbreak that led to the destruction of more than 600,000 fruit trees. Not those suspected of having smuggled contaminated root stock into the country nor those responsible for the bureaucratic bungling and buck-passing that followed.Growers whose orchards have only just been given the all-clear fear the same thing could happen again.BRONWYN HERBERT: It's a new dawn for the citrus industry in central Queensland. After an exotic disease outbreak and almost five years in the quarantine wilderness, farmers are once again turning Emerald a darker shade of green.CRAIG PRESSLER, 2PH FARMS: We've moved on and we've replanted, replanted over 200,000 trees up until this point. And we'll be back to where we were, which was near enough to a quarter of a million trees by June this year. BRONWYN HERBERT: Replanting's been under way on a grand scale at 2PH Farms, which at the time of the canker outbreak was one of the largest citrus producers in Queensland.With Emerald now officially declared free of the disease, the first citrus crop in years is leaving the farm gate.CRAIG PRESSLER: I don't know that people ever get over the heartbreak of it or get over those feelings that they've had.

This became Ground Zero for us and that's where all the turmoil started.BRONWYN HERBERT: On this one property, a quarter of a million trees were bulldozed, and within a 60km radius of Emerald, more than 600,000 trees were ripped out - all part of the government and industry bid to contain the spread of citrus canker.There is no known cure for this disease which causes lesions on citrus leaves and stems and ultimately affects both the quality and quantity of the fruit itself. But just how canker made its way to Emerald has never been conclusively proven.This is the story of a major quarantine breach, a devastating disease, a swag of
