Programs	Summer Series: 2 Live 2 Deadly
Sunday 24 January 2010, 1:30pm ABC1 From humble beginnings operating out of a terrace house in Redfern twenty years ago, the Aboriginal voice on Sydney radio has struggled to seal its place on the city's airwaves.For Koori Radio, its roller-coaster ride in the battle for a fulltime on-air licence ended in success back in 2002.And since then the station's gone from strength to strength with the broadcaster opening its new state-of-the-art studio late last year.
MIRIAM COROWA:Hello, I'm Miriam Corowa. Welcome to Message Stick's Summer Series. From humble beginnings operating out of a terrace house in Redfern twenty years ago, the Aboriginal voice on Sydney radio has struggled to find its place. But after 2 decades of struggle it's now a success with new studios, a record label and a program to find and develop Koori talent. 2 Live and 2 Deadly is the story of Aboriginal self determination played out on Sydneyï¿½s airwaves. Enjoy the show.NATHAN MORAN: Welcome back listeners, you're listening to Koori Radio, live and deadly, 93.7, and you've got the Goori correspondent doing the Yarncarters. And what we can report, again, is 221 years since the gubba invaded our shores and we're still waiting for freedom, still waiting for an offering of an agreement. FEMALE ANNOUNCER: 93.7, Koori Radio live and deadly. (SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE) ..meaning "this is our voice", voice for all the Torres Strait people in both the eastern and western languages... MALE ANNOUNCER: Special shout out to all the Samoan listeners tuning in tonight. (SPEAKS SAMOAN) FEMALE ANNOUNCER: To all the girls, all the sassy mamas, this one's for you from Marloo's Blues, and here we go! CATHIE CRAIGIE: We put it out there on the grapevine that Koori Radio was, although it always would be managed and controlled by Aboriginal people, the target audience that we were trying to reach was, you know, the brown people of Sydney. BRAD COOKE: We've got our own recording studios and radio studios, state-of-the-art, well soundproofed, and the best equipment. AGNES WARE: To hear any Aboriginal music on 96-point-whatever they are, one, whatever - you don't hear any Aboriginal music or Torres Strait Islander music or even Indigenous music from around the world, too, on any white station. You don't hear it. Why do you think we've got our own station? Hello! No! (LAUGHS) NARRATOR: This story is about Aboriginal radio in Sydney, and its long struggle to achieve a permanent presence. Our story begins in 1988, Australia's bicentenary. The bicentenary saw the largest mobilisation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal protestors this country had ever seen. They were not only dissatisfied with the lack of black progress, but angered by continued injustices. PROTESTORS CHANT: Land rights! Land rights! NARRATOR: This so-called national birthday celebration clearly demonstrated to Aboriginal people that their voices were still not being heard. But the first Aboriginal community radio station in Sydney, Radio Redfern, set out to change all that. TIGA BAYLES ON AIR: Radio Redfern's on air, Aboriginal people in control of the frequency, 88.9 FM. But '88 is going to be a big year. It's a big year for white Australia because they've got some big celebrations taking place. TIGA BAYLES: So I'm in the march, giving reports back. "Oh, there seems to be 15, 20,000 people here. Now we've met up at Belmore Park and there's another 10, 15, 20,000 people there. This march is just looking amazing, there are traditional owners up the front that are painted up in traditional paint and they're singing traditional songs, and there's dances happening, and there's boomerangs and spears and stuff, and there are so many mixed race people behind us, the different cultures that are supporting us on this march." CATHIE CRAIGIE: So the excitement of what was happening around 1988 here in Sydney probably influenced a lot of us, and thought, "Well, hang on, wouldn't it be great to have this feeling all the time or to be able to continue this information?" And there was a nu
