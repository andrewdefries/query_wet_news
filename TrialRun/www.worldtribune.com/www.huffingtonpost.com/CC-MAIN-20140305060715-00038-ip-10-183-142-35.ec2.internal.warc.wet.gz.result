New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's appeal to what he called "common sense" at a congressional hearing Wednesday morning failed to sway two Republican senators who said that giving the government the ability to block the purchase of guns by suspected terrorists would undermine the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.
"Shouldn't FBI agents have the authority to block sales of guns and explosives to those on the terror watchlists -- and deemed too dangerous to fly? I actually believe that they should," Bloomberg told senators. Federal law currently only allows the government to block guns sales for a very limited number of reasons, and being on that list is not one of them. (For more background, see Tuesday's article on the subject.)
"This common-sense legislation is not anti-gun -- it's anti-terrorist," chimed in Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), the sponsor of a bill that would close what Bloomberg has called a "terror gap."
But GOP Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina wouldn't go along.
Admitting that "at first blush" the bill "seems to be an obvious step that we should take," Collins said that many people on the FBI's watchlist don't belong there. "None of us wants a terrorist to be able to purchase a gun, but neither should we want to infringe upon a Constitutional right of law-abiding Americans," she said.
Graham described the bill as an instrument of those who would ban guns altogether. "We're talking about a constitutional right here," he said, explaining that he could not support a bill that would force "innocent Americans" to "pay the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back."
Graham wasn't nearly as concerned about rights when he launched into a disquisition on the treatment of American citizens accused of terrorism. "I am all into national security," he said. "I want them to stop reading these guys Miranda rights."
Like many of his fellow Republicans, Graham assailed the administration for respecting the constitutional rights of suspected terrorists, suggesting instead that they should be treated like enemies on the battlefield.
"Even if you're an American citizen helping the enemy, you should be seen as a potential enemy," he said, "not as someone who committed a crime in New York."
After the hearing, Bloomberg told reporters he had no problem with federal investigators reading Faisal Shahzad, the suspect in this weekend's Times Square bomb plot, his Miranda rights, saying that "our democracy is strong enough" for that.
As for the Second Amendment concerns, Bloomberg said in his testimony: "Our founding fathers did not write the Second Amendment to empower people who wanted to terrorize a free state; they wrote it to protect people who could defend 'the security of a free state.' Today, the security of our free state is being tested by terrorists."
A new Government Accountability Office report out today disclosed that from February 2004 through February 2010, individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 1,228 times. Of those, 1,119, or 91 percent, were allowed to proceed because there were no legally disqualifying factors.
New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Shahzad had purchased a gun in Connecticut in March, shortly after returning from a trip to Pakistan. Officials found a 9mm pistol and ammunition in Shahzad's car. Shahzad was not put on the terror watchlist until Monday, the day before he was captured.
"It appears March is when he decided to put this plan in motion," Kelly said, noting that for a terror suspect to buy a gun "may well be an indicator of putting something catastrophic in motion."

Colleges are actually extraordinarily safe places, with the majority of experts espousing that the relative lack of guns is precisely what makes them havens from violent crimes.	Judge H. Lee Sarokin: Should Terror Suspects be Mirandized?
Yes, in this case, it appears that we have caught the perpetrator red-handed. The evidence of his guilt is overwhelming, so the argument for treating him differently has some visceral appeal. But let's test it by the facts of this very case.	Len Levitt: A New Mayor Mike: Terrorism Tough Guy
Why is Bloomberg -- who in his two terms as mayor ceded virtually all law enforcement authority to NYPD Commissioner Kelly -- now becoming a Terrorism Tough Guy?	Antonio Villaraigosa: Too Dangerous to Fly on a Plane? Then Too Dangerous to Buy a Gun
If someone is too dangerous to fly on a plane in this country, that person is too dangerous to buy explosives and guns.	Michael R. Bloomberg: Terror Suspects Are Buying Guns - and the FBI Can't Stop Them
It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47. It is time to close the "Terror Gap" in our gun laws.	The New York Public Library: Library Faces Harshest Budget Cut in History
Clearly, the city is struggling. Clearly, the economy is still recovering. And that's exactly why the city must clearly restore funding to save libraries.	Around the Web:

This vegetarian festival might turn spectators away from meat -- even though it turns people into shish kebobs.
Participants in the Phuket Vegetarian Festival in Thailand pierce their faces with skewers, knives, drill bits, umbrellas and even model helicopters as a part of the annual body purification ceremony.
Believed to have been celebrated by the city's Chinese community since 1825, the tradition started in the Kathu district, the home of many Chinese residents and shrines, according to a festival website.
When members of a visiting Chinese opera troupe fell ill in Phuket amidst a deadly outbreak of disease, the performers realized they had failed to honor two Taoist gods on the first nine days of the ninth Chinese lunar month, according to lore. After adopting a vegetarian diet, the performers recovered -- wowing the locals.
Every year since, Chinese residents of Phuket have held the Vegetarian Festival, abstaining from meat, alcohol and sex. Other festival guidelines include wearing white and keeping clean -- especially when it comes to kitchen utensils, according to PhuketVegetarian.com's list of 10 festival rules.
People who are mourning and women who are pregnant or menstruating are urged not to attend the celebration, the site notes.
Worshippers start the ceremony by rising "go teng" poles into the sky at dusk, according to the Phuket Gazette.
The poles, which are adorned with nine lanterns for the gods, remain upright until the end of the festivities when they are lowered, meaning the gods have gone back to the heavens, the paper notes.
Many participants don't eat meat for the last three days of the festival, which stretches from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5, this year, according to the International Business Times. Some choose to go vegetarian for the entire duration of the rite, a Phuket tourism website notes.
But the festival is best-known for a more extreme act of devotion.
Participants called "ma song" or "mah song" -- meaning "horses of the gods" or "spirit mediums" -- inflict pain on themselves, absorbing bad energy to keep it away from their communities.
Some of the ma song, who say their bodies are taken over by gods during the festival, dress in white and stride across hot coals or climb and descend ladders made of knives.
Others stick things through their faces.

In processions with fireworks and drummers -- believed to help drive away evil spirits -- the ma song march through the city. According to a festival website, people become ma song for two reasons -- they are either specifically chosen by the gods to play the role, or they have received a bad omen and are hoping to alter their fate.
By sticking foreign objects -- which range from blades to firearms -- through their cheeks, many ma song believe they can keep bad karma away from other people.
"I know that the spirit pierces my cheeks with the object, with no anesthetic, but I feel no pain at all," ma song Khun Uten told Phuket.com. "It's lucky that, in my case, he never uses any of the large, frightening objects you see some ma song carrying."
"Every time my body is taken over by the god, I know what's going to happen, and I want to stop it," the 35-year-old Phuket native and father of two, who has pierced his face at the festivals since he was 15, told the website. "I want to run away. But, as I said, my body is not mine anymore and I cannot resist."

If you think you've got it
bad because your bed partner snores, think again. In an engrossing editorial about sleep violence, a man chronicles what it's like to commit violent acts in his sleep (granted, his didn't go much further than punching the headboard or
acting like a defensive lineman). But sleep violence can be serious. And it's not something to joke about. It entails a spectrum of disorders, including:
Night terrors: momentary, frightening hallucinations, resulting in panic and confusion. Night terrors are common among children. Most children grow out of them, though some can progress to more violent forms of this behavior in adolescence.
R.E.M. Sleep Behavior Disorder (R.B.D.): this is characterized by vivid dreams that portray threatening persons or objects. Mild instances result in restlessness and abnormal twitching in bed; more serious are occasions when people, in acting out their dreams, attempt to fight back against their imaginary foe, thereby raising the risk of serious injury.
For centuries, high-profile cases have involved sleep violence. If you strangle your wife to death in your sleep, should you be held 100 percent accountable? This has been a tricky subject for legal scholars. Are there any risk factors? Certainly. Most patients with R.B.D. are males over 50 years of age. Interestingly, scientists have discovered that people with R.B.D. develop lesions on a small portion of their brain stem that ordinarily inhibits physical movement during R.E.M. sleep. So while most people are "paralyzed" during sleep, people with R.B.D. are not, and can sleepwalk and do things with their bodies that you'd normally equate with being wide awake and fully conscious. Other risk factors include:
sleep
deprivation
stress
alcohol
consumption
The good news is we have a
collection of drugs at our disposal to help people with serious R.B.D., which people in previous centuries did not (though they would lock people up and force them to sleep alone). Therapy can also work for some people. The phenomenon has been the
subject of a television movie. After Kenneth Parks, an unemployed Canadian, murdered his mother-in-law in 1987, Hilary Swank filled the role of playing his wife in "The Sleepwalker Killing" (1997). Having no motive for the crime and a history of sleepwalking, Parks was acquitted by an Ontario jury. In another case in Scottsdale AZ, the man was found guilty. If you or someone you know is prone to violent acts in their sleep, they should immediately see a sleep specialist to get help - this is a treatable disorder.

While it is widely known that adequate sleep is necessary for optimal mental performance, most do not know that adequate sleep can help prevent weight gain.	Dr. Michael J. Breus: Social Networking, Sleep Deprivation, Drug Use and Teens
