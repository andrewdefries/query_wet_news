How Netflix Is Ruining My Relationship (And Might Be Ruining Yours)
Zoë Triska
Senior Books Editor, The Huffington Post	What's not so nice? Having to wait for said person you love in order to watch the rest of the fully-released season. Here are the worst things for me about watching a show with my beloved.

Abusing Women Is Criminal, Not Cultural
Kelly Rutherford
Actress and activist	In some countries it is estimated that as many as seven out of 10 women are beaten, raped, abused or mutilated.
Comments 6 Things We Learned This Week From Goldie and Kim
Ann Brenoff
Senior Writer, The Huffington Post	The Academy Awards appearances of Goldie Hawn, 68, and Kim Novak, 81, triggered a firestorm of fan reaction. Both actresses appeared with what were perceived to be dramatically altered faces and the Internet was quick to harshly criticize them. Can we pause a moment and reconnect with reality -- both theirs and ours?
Comments Binge vs. Buzz: The Release Model of House of Cards vs. True Detective
Jeremy Wilson
Writer + Creative Strategist	There is no doubt Netflix's strategy of enabling users to binge watch old TV episodes has been successful, but is it the optimal strategy for releasing high profile new content?
Comments Aisle View: The Demon Barber of Lincoln Center
Steven Suskin
Drama critic	There is always a place for a production of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's Sweeney Todd, especially one that gives us an oversized orchestra filling the hall with Sondheim's masterful score.
Comments I Witnessed Hollywood's Sexism Firsthand -- And Said Nothing
Kathleen Miles
Associate Editor, HuffPost Los Angeles	One man said, "Would you rather keep the Oscar statue or get a blow job from any actress in the first three rows?"
Comments (361) Why American Women Hate Their Faces, and What They Could Learn From the Brits
Lorraine Devon Wilke
Sass & Sensibility	We've all seen one famous face after another tumble down the rabbit hole of peer pressure, cultural expectations, show business demands, sheer vanity, fear of death, revulsion of aging and the simple miscalculation that the only beauty is youthful beauty. It's a heavy burden.
Comments Dancing With the Stars
Diana Nyad
Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcaster	Some behind-the-scenes snapshots from this morning's Good Morning America announcement of this season's cast of Dancing With the Stars.
Comments The Deceptively Simple Pattern in Popular Songs and Speeches That Makes Them So Catchy
Peter Watts
Writer and presenter	Sarah Palin, James Bond, and Austin Powers walk into a bar. What they do in the rest of the joke is anybody's guess, but what they might do is raise a toast to the darned clever writers who created their catchphrases.
Comments Why Belle Knox's Anonymity Was So Important, As Told by an Out Sex Worker
Eric Barry
Writer, comedian, and creator of the 'Full Disclosure' sex podcast	Belle Knox, who is impressively sagacious at just 18, is joining the company of some tremendous voices in the industry who are redefining what it means to be a sex worker.
Comments Mixology Season 1, Episode 2: The Bathing Proposal
Hulu.com
Watchers of Good TV	The hangover could be settling in earlier than expected for ABC's Mixology, the show about what happens to 10 singles over the course of a single night out in New York City.
Comments Film Fatal Assistance Spotlights Colossal Aid Failure in Haiti
Georgianne Nienaber
Writer and author	Fatal Assistance ably demonstrates the folly and damage caused by swarms of NGO's and Hollywood do-gooders that completely ignored the root causes of Haiti's problems pre and post earthquake.
Comments How Rob Minkoff Turned Mr. Peabody & Sherman Into the Original Modern Family
Jim Hill
Entertainment journalist and Walt Disney Company expert	It's ironic that Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a sequence involving the Trojan horse. Because according to the director of this production, this animated feature is actually something of a Trojan horse in and of itself.
Comments Mighty Movie's Temple of Bad: Karate-Robo Zaborgar
Dan Persons
Film journalist	Well, here's a ticklish situation: Is Karate-Robo Zaborgar a bad film, or a good film trying to be bad, or a film so good at being bad that it's actually bad?
Comments Talking With Mike Gordon, Jonny Two Bags, Seventh Key's Billy Greer and Jimbo Mathus, Plus a Loreena McKennitt Exclusive
Mike Ragogna
Music Biz Vet	"There's probably so many different kinds of albums we could have made, because they were all just little snippets, just moments, some of them maybe implied a song and some were just a lick. But I got all excited and I thought, 'We've got to keep doing this.' ... Some people go to an amusement park, we go sit in a room with guitars."
Comments Garcia v. Google: Hard Cases Make Bad Law
Schuyler M. Moore
Partner, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, LLP; Author	The truth, for good or ill, is that judges rule with their hearts, and then they add a bunch of words to rationalize what they have done. The problem is that those bunch of words are often senseless and more often come back to cause contortions in later decisions.
Comments Content Before Celebrity, Sun Valley Film Festival Serves an Eclectic Menu
Gordy Grundy
Artist and Columnist	The Sun Valley Film Festival is young, with an attitude that is reflective of the city. The programming offers a preference for content over tinsel. The third annual film festival is presented this March 13-16.
Comments Pam Grier Talks 'Dining Out for Life' HIV/AIDS Event and LGBT Issues (AUDIO)
Charlotte Robinson
Broadcast journalist and host, 'OUTTAKE VOICES'	This week I talked with actor Pam Grier -- legendary for her starring roles in Foxy Brown and Jackie Brown, and for her role as Kit Porter on The L Word -- about Dining Out for Life, being a spokesperson for this fabulous event and her spin on LGBT issues.
Comments Older and Fabulous -- It's Not a Fantasy Hollywood Script
Jill Brooke
Author, "The Need to Say No: How to be Bullish and Not Bullied"	In aging gracefully, it's not about doing plastic surgery but over-doing it. It's about making good choices.
Comments Oscar Is Not Religious
Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr.
William M. Suttles Chair of Religious Studies, Georgia State University	The speech shouldn't seem canned and rehearsed or else you appear to have expected to win. It also can't ramble, as there's so little time. And if you have won for being an actor, well, then you're supposed to act well.
Comments Week in Film: Grand Budapest Hotel, The Face of Love
Marshall Fine
Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.com	How do I love the work of Wes Anderson? Let me count the ways. Anderson may be the most consistently original filmmaker to emerge during the 25 years I've been writing about film in New York.
Comments Is Today's Young Music Too Obscene? (Or Has My Perspective Changed?)
The University of Central Florida Forum
Opinion series by faculty, staff and students of UCF	I still sometimes struggle reconciling the self of my youth with the guy who now has a mortgage and an SUV. But the minute I became a parent, my worldview shifted slightly on its axis and I began to view everything through new parental lenses.
