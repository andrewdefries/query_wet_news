The Question I Never Want To Answer Again
Andromeda Turre
Vocalist and songwriter
I'm pretty sure there is no box for that. You might need a suitcase for all of that. And knowing that will not likely help you to relate to me, understand me or know me any more than you did five seconds ago.
Comments (50) How I Found Authenticity in My Writing, Without Becoming a Secret Agent
Taylor Griffith
High School Senior at Westtown School
During my writer's journey, I've come across an interesting question that I think every writer (and non-writer) can relate to: what makes something or someone authentic?
Comments (2) Why Being My Brother's Keeper Matters
Gov. Deval Patrick
Governor, Massachusetts
As a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.
Comments (14) Should I Buy or Rent My Home? Six Crucial Factors You Should Consider
WiserAdvisor.com
Financial advisor matching site
One person's "flexibility" is another person's "lack of stability." And one person's "stuck" is another person's "steady." The way you'll feel about buying vs. renting is very much in the eye of the beholder.
Comments (1) On Arizona's S.B. 1062, Russia and Why If One More Person Tells Me Black People Are More Homophobic, I'll Scream
J Mase III
Poet, educator and activist
As an openly gay and openly trans* person of color, I hear from so many folks about how homophobic my people are. I even hear many folks of color tell me about how much more homophobic black and Latino folks are, but is that all really true?
Comments (3) From Homeless to Hopeful: How a Trans Woman of Color Found Her Path (VIDEO)
Nathan Manske
Founder and Executive Director, I'm From Driftwood
Angela's story is a message of how important it is for parents to love and support their children, but also how it's never too late to change your life for the better.
Comments (0) Pam Grier Talks 'Dining Out for Life' HIV/AIDS Event and LGBT Issues (AUDIO)
Charlotte Robinson
Broadcast journalist and host, 'OUTTAKE VOICES'
This week I talked with actor Pam Grier -- legendary for her starring roles in Foxy Brown and Jackie Brown, and for her role as Kit Porter on The L Word -- about Dining Out for Life, being a spokesperson for this fabulous event and her spin on LGBT issues.
Comments (1) Let's Fix a Justice System That Isn't Working
Harry Belafonte
Entertainer & Activist
There is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.
Comments (25) My Stepmom Suffered From Schizophrenia, and I Had No Idea (VIDEO)
Kathy Carter Woods
Mom and Featured Columnist, Ricki Lake Show
Patty was a wonderful stepmom. Sweet and kind, she treated my sister and me like we were her very own. She worked for the airlines and often had a crazy, upside-down schedule, yet she never failed to be a loving force for good.
Comments (1) The N'Word as Sculpture
Joe Morton
Actor
If I were a sculptor, I would create a memorial to all those who have suffered from its poisonous and debilitating affects. I would construct the word out of deeply scarred and rusted steel to symbolize its onerous antiquity and unfortunate endurance. I would make the letters as tall as the average person to suggest that human beings, not animals, were demeaned by this word.
Comments (0) Oscar for Valid Dreamers
Rep. Charles Rangel
Representative from the 13th Congressional District in New York
During her acceptance speech, Lupita Nyong'o eloquently remarked: "No matter where you're from, your dreams are valid." We should continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that can provide every talented person the opportunity to succeed in the greatest nation on Earth.
Comments (0) In Defence of the Poor Little White Man
Shihab S Joi
Freelance editor, part-time parent
If we're really to humour the idea that only white people can be racist, what about the rest of the world where white people don't figure? Those African countries wiping out their neighbours are doing it just for the power, silly - perish the very idea that genocide or ethnic cleansing has anything to do with racism...
Comments (0) Of Fathers and Father Figures: Supporting or Undermining Gay Men's Health
John-Manuel Andriote
Journalist and author, 'Victory Deferred: How AIDS Changed Gay Life in America'
Gay men's relationships with our fathers are often fraught, to say the least. But without a father's loving support and kicks-in-the-butt as needed, research suggests that the odds already stacked against us in enjoying good mental health and staying HIV-negative grow even steeper.
Comments (1) Democrats Disgrace Themselves on Adegbile Vote
Earl Ofari Hutchinson
Author and political analyst
Someone, such as Adegbile, would have thoughtfully and aggressively enforced the nation's civil rights and voting rights which are exactly the very thing that the GOP has done everything possible to undermine. Now we can add a troop of timid and self-serving Democrats to that shameful list.
Comments (0) Spike Is Right! Crooked Landlords Terrorize Brooklyn Tenants (Pt 1)
Antonia Marrero
Filmmaker, Educator
This development has brought incredible resources to the area, but the rent-regulated homes of Williamsburg are being systematically and violently dismantled by crooked landlords.
Comments (2) Why Retirement Security for Women Is Not an Option
Dedrick Muhammad
Senior Director of Economic Programs, NAACP
March marks Women's History Month -- a time for celebrating women's historic gains and achievements. But, equally important, especially in this sluggish economic recovery, is amplifying the contemporary economic challenges women continue to face, including the uphill climb to retirement security.
Comments (1) On the "A" w/Souleo: Two Art Projects Aim to Rebuild Community
Peter 'Souleo' Wright
Journalist and curator
Comments (0) Stokely: A Life
Arlene M. Roberts
Attorney and policy analyst
The material is structured, well edited and devoid of academic jargon. Yet, it took me almost four days to read the book.
