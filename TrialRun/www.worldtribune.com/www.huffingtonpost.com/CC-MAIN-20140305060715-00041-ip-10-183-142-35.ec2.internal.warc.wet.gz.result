Religion News Service
WASHINGTON (RNS) White evangelicals and Tea Party members are less likely to believe in evolution and climate change than most Americans, a finding that could pose a particular problem for Republican presidential hopefuls.
A new poll released Thursday (Sept. 22) also showed that a majority of Americans (57 percent) believes in evolution, and an even larger majority (69 percent) believes in climate change -- though many still disagree that the phenomenon is based on human activity.
But most Americans do not insist that their presidential candidates share their views on these issues, nor do they believe scientists have come to a consensus on them, according to the poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute in partnership with Religion News Service.
The views of white evangelicals and Tea Party members stand apart.
Even though these issues aren't deal-breakers for most voters, they are "symbolically important for two groups that play an outsize role in Republican primary politics: white evangelical Protestants and members of the Tea Party," said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI.
"Because evangelicals and Tea Party members hold views that are significantly different than the general population, the challenge for Republican candidates is to talk about these issues now in a way that will not hurt them later in the general election," Jones said.
On evolution, a third (32 percent) of white evangelicals affirm a belief in evolution, compared to two-thirds of white mainline
Protestants, six in 10 Catholics and three-quarters of the unaffiliated.
On climate change, though strong majorities in every religious group say they believe the earth is getting warmer, white evangelicals (31 percent) are significantly less likely to believe the change is caused by human activity. That compares to 43 percent of white mainline Protestants, 50 percent of Catholics and 52 percent of the unaffiliated.
The poll reveals an unusual political schism on climate change. Typically, Republicans come down on one side of a question, Democrats on the other, and independents in the middle, said Dan Cox, PRRI's research director.
On climate change, Republicans (49 percent) cluster with Tea Party members (41 percent) on whether there is solid evidence that the earth is warming. That compares to 81 percent of Democrats and seven in 10 independents.
"There is no reason for climate change to be a partisan issue," said Cox. "But the political leadership on the issue has led to a
polarization of opinion, with Democrats and independents on one side and Republicans on the other."
Many Americans say they do not care much about a candidate's stance on either evolution or climate change: more than half (53 percent) say a belief or disbelief in evolution wouldn't affect their vote, and about as many say the same about a candidate who doesn't believe climate change is caused by human activity.
White evangelicals, however, care.
Only four in 10 evangelicals say a candidate's views on evolution would make no difference in their vote, and those who say they cared about a candidate's position say they would be less likely to vote for someone who believes in evolution. By contrast, Americans overall who cared about evolution say they'd be more likely to vote for a politician who believes in it.
Tea Party members (33 percent), more than any other group, are more likely to support a candidate who does not believe in climate change. That compares to 16 percent of Republicans and 5 percent of Democrats.
Americans also doubt a strong consensus exists among scientists on climate change, a phenomenon that has frustrated the vast majority of climatologists who consider it a problem caused by human activity. Only four in 10 Americans believe a consensus exists.
A slight majority (51 percent) says a consensus of scientists believes in evolution, though evolution is overwhelmingly endorsed
throughout the scientific community.
In other findings:
On stewardship of the earth, 57 percent say God wants humans to live responsibly with animals and plants. A sizable minority (36 percent), however, prefers the idea that "God gave human beings the right to use animals, plants and all the resources of the planet for human benefit."
Black Protestants are evenly divided on evolution, with 47 percent affirming it and 46 percent affirming creationism.
Though most Americans believe in evolution, they disagree on its driving force. Of those who believe in evolution, 30 percent say it's driven by natural selection or another natural process, compared to 22 percent who say a divine being guides it.
The PRRI/RNS Religion News Survey was based on telephone interviews with 1,013 adults between Sept. 14 and 18. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

As we approach crucial climate change negotiations in Cancún, Mexico, the key question on many people's minds is this: what nation will have the courage to stand up to the United States? Robert J. Lempert: Redesigning the International Approach to Climate Change
Instead of a specific international plan for the energy revolution, we should have some nations race ahead and, once a majority has discovered a promising path, give them the tools to strongly encourage the rest to follow.	Sen. John Kerry: Transforming Our Power
The proposal I'm rolling out today with Sen. Lieberman, major energy and comprehensive climate change legislation, will create nearly 2 million new jobs and support the research and development to help us maintain leadership.	Daniel C. Esty: Climate Change Plan B
Cap and trade has proved infeasible. But it remains critical to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. We need to do it right this time. Let's avoid complexity and adopt a straightforward carbon charge.	Matt J. Rossano: Evolution: Is God Just Playing Dice?
The more we understand evolution, the less it seems like either the bogeyman creationists fear or the universal God-dissolving acid some atheists crave.	Karl Giberson, Ph.D: Why Evangelicals Are Fooled Into Accepting Pseudoscience
So why have evangelicals been so ready to reject the generally accepted conclusions of the scientific community on climate change? It has nothing to do with climate science per se.	Byron Kennard: What's a Drag Queen Got to Do with Global Warming?

Sports News
Belgium's Kim Clijsters plays a double-handed backhand shot during her first round women's singles match against Serbia's Jelena Jankovic on the first day of the 2012 Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament at the All England Tennis Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on June 25, 2012. WIMBLEDON, England -- Kim Clijsters' last Wimbledon got off to a good start when she beat former top-ranked player Jelena Jankovic of Serbia 6-2, 6-4 in the first round.
Clijsters is playing at the All England Club for just the second time in six years and has said she is retiring after this year's U.S. Open – this time for good, having returned to the sport in 2009 after a two-year break.
The 47th-ranked Belgian looked to have recovered fully from recent injuries, breaking the 18th-seeded Jankovic five times – including at love in the final game to clinch the victory.
She improved her record to 8-1 against Jankovic.

The White House responded to the petition to deport Piers Morgan in a statement defending freedom of speech on Wednesday. Morgan has been an outspoken critic of the country's gun policies in the wake of the Newtown shooting. Gun advocates launched a petition on the White House website, which called for the British host to be deported. The petition surpassed the threshold necessary for the White House to respond — 25,000 signatures — in December. The White House released its comment in a piece entitled, "When Discussing the Second Amendment, Keep the First in Mind Too." "Let’s not let arguments over the Constitution’s Second Amendment violate the spirit of its First," White House press secretary Jay Carney wrote. He continued, "Americans may disagree on matters of public policy and express those disagreements vigorously, but no one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment -- or any other matter of public concern." Read the full response on the White House website. Related on HuffPost:	Loading Slideshow

Ironic as it sounds, there can be an immense feeling of relief that comes along with eating a bag of peanut M&Ms washed down with an ice cold Coca-Cola on a humid summer day in rural China. Take it from a weary world traveler, the availability of certain packaged foods like Oreos and Pringles across the globe provides the satisfying comfort of a familiar taste (Photo Credit: Flickr/aflier). Slideshow: The Strangest Packaged Foods of All Time
It's one of modern civilization's greatest conveniences, and yet at the same time, one of the major advantages of this globalized market is the sheer number choices. To please any kind of palate, a multitude of bizarre packaged foods and beverages exist for those who are willing to look hard enough and be experimental in their tastes. From pickle-flavored popsicles to buffalo wing soda, there are American companies that are urging consumers to take their taste buds for a walk on the wild side.
Slideshow: Reviewing Taco Bell's New Cantina Bell Menu
Although precise production and distribution networks ensure that a vast majority of our favorite packaged foods, whether Cheerios or Oscar Mayer wieners, are available in supermarkets from sea to shining sea, what do you do if the same old Hostess CupCakes you've been eating since grade school become boring? The same old Skippy peanut butter or the identical Wrigley's Spearmint gum can lose its sheen, and you may find yourself on an insatiable quest for variety and new flavors in your packaged goods.
Slideshow: Celebrities' Backstage Food Demands
Luckily, there are a number of bizarre packaged foods and beverages out there for those who are willing to look hard enough and be experimental in their tastes. Ever heard of pork brains smothered in milk gravy? (You might've not guessed, but this delicacy is quite high in cholesterol!). Or how about bacon-flavored mints or even canned alligator meat? Click through to find out about these products and others that made this list of the strangest packaged foods of all time.
