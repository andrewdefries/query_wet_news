Rachel Maddow discussed what she called the "Beltway media's capital 'q' question of the day" on her show Wednesday night: will GOP candidate Ron Paul win the Iowa caucuses in January?
Maddow was discussing what she called Paul's "sustained" and "solid" polling performance in Iowa since Thanksgiving. She pointed out that while Paul was not leading the polls, his consistent performance has caused the "Beltway media" to speculate that the Republican candidate could win in Iowa.
"That would change everything in Republican politics! That would change everything in the 2012 race this year! If Ron Paul won Iowa, that would change everything, right? Wouldn't it?" Maddow said. "No, no it wouldn't."
Maddow referenced former Republican candidate Mika Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008. Maddow said that in 2008, Huckabee "had about as much of a chance to win the Republican nomination for president as [she] did," despite his success in Iowa. "Iowa Republicans' parochial, picayune, conservatism is so unrepresentative of the rest of the country's voters, even of the rest of the country's Republican voters...Iowa Republicans do not pick presidents. They pick Huckabees."
Maddow admitted that while it would be "fun" to watch Paul win in Iowa this year, it would mean "roughly nothing to the rest of the presidential race." WATCH:

Kristen Bell is making her return to TV in Showtime's "House of Lies" (premieres Sunday, Jan. 8, 10 p.m. EST), but don't expect this to be the typical Kristen Bell role. Her character, management consultant Jeannie Van Der Hooven, is spunky; but hiding underneath the sassy exterior is one very ambitious and morally ambiguous woman. Veronica Mars she isn't.
"She doesn't have the strongest moral compass, but the interesting thing compounding that is she doesn't really think she's doing anything wrong," Bell told The Huffington Post in a phone interview in late December. "She is completely compartmentalized and I've never played anyone like that. I've always kind of played characters that have a stronger sense of what's right and wrong. Jeannie's really multidimensional."
In "House of Lies," Bell stars alongside Don Cheadle, Ben Schwartz, Josh Lawson and Dawn Olivieri, all playing top-notch business consultants who wheel and deal with the one percent. Bell got her big break in 2004's "Veronica Mars," a cult-hit series about a teen private eye. Following the cancellation of "Mars" in 2007, she joined the cast of "Heroes," further cementing herself as a geek goddess, and then, took to the big screen in films like "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and "Burlesque." Now, "House of Lies" is like her homecoming.
Why did you say yes to this role as your return to TV?
I had an itch to do TV again with a few specific goals in mind: I didn't want to carry it on my shoulders. I wanted to work with someone out of my league. Also, I wanted a network that had cache and the ability to provide a provocative storyline. I'm not even saying that necessarily had to be the dictionary definition, like sexy; I just wanted something outside of the box, something that could tackle issues that wasn't necessarily falling under the censorship umbrella of primetime.
I wanted something different. I had either Showtime or HBO in mind and Dax [Shepard, her fiance] and I had come up with a show idea that we met with Showtime about and they loved it and ended up buying it. The day after that, I got a call from the head of the network at Showtime asking me to look into "House of Lies" and it was just kind of an immediate, "Yes."
And that other project, is it still in contention?
Mm hm, yeah. I mean, it's in development. They'll usually take two or three years to ever get on the air.
Can you tell me anything else about that?
It's currently in development, so it might change a ton, so I'd rather not just in case it ends up changing completely. Hopefully, it will one day come to be.
It's exciting, nonetheless. You mentioned you wanted something different. I think your "House of Lies" character Jeannie is completely different than anything movie and TV viewers have seen you in.
I agree.
Did you have to do anything that made you uncomfortable? In one episode, a guy sucks on your character's foot. Did you have a foot double?
Oh, no, no. That wasn't uncomfortable at all! [Laughs] Having an actor I just met put my foot in his mouth? No, I did not have a foot double. I'm not really into doubles for stunts or anything else, but it was as awkward as it seems to be. You know, I had just met another actor who, as per the crazy script written, needed to put my foot in his mouth. We talked about it and I washed my foot and he had a mint -- just for shits and giggles -- and we just kind of went for it. We didn't practice it at all, obviously, because: No. 1) Why would you? That's weird. No. 2) We wanted it to be realistically awkward when we did it. I think it worked.
During the actual execution though, it didn't feel -- the sensory of it -- didn't feel as awkward as I thought.
And Jeannie discovers that as well.
Exactly. [Laughs] Jeannie and Kristen are a real big parallel and it is frightening. [Laughs]
Are you like Jeannie at all?
I think I can be as ambitious and determined as Jeannie. I think that it's difficult not to. I'm not as morally bankrupt as she is. [Laughs] I think I have a different set of values, which is what differentiates us, but I think in moments, I can absolutely be as cut-throat and as ambitious and as determined.
Well, that was another question: What do you think drives Jeannie? It's obviously her ambition.
Her ambition, for sure. I think she does not want to be who or what she was born into. You'll see within the rest of the season. Her home life unfolds a little bit before you and you realize more of what drives her. I think she's running so far from her past and her family because she does not identify with them and she feels that if she settles into what she was born into, it would be the death of her. So she's drawn to this sort of sexy, glossy world of cut-throat business.
She has some great one-liners. The line that stuck out to me was when she says off-handedly, "I'd rather work at Arby's." That made me laugh out loud.
I think in that moment she would rather work at Arby's. Working with these dunces is sometimes a lot for her to handle, but secretly she adores them. There was a line that I added that [writer] Matt Carnahan let me add where I got to call them "fatties," which I thought was really wonderful.
"Fatties"? Yeah, I walked up and said, "What are you two fatties talking about?" And I don't know why, but I think because they're both rail-thin, it really made me laugh.
When you were looking for TV projects, were you looking for something darker? Because this is pretty raunchy.
I was looking for something darker in tone; not necessarily raunch or sex, but definitely something more adult or darker in tone. Less safe.
"House of Lies" is for fans of ... fill in the blank.
... is for fans of sophisticated filth, which I think really sums it up. As funny as it is, it kind of really sums it up, doesn't it? I was looking for something daring -- that's a better way to put it other than provocative and raunch ... It's relevant in the current zeitgeist with the whole Occupy movement. All of these characters are wheeling and dealing, showing you the behind-the-scenes dirty business. I think it's attractive, sophisticated filth.
You just keep taking all my questions. The next one is literally, "This is such an appropriate time for 'House of Lies' with the whole Occupy Wall Street and one percent and all that."
You know I'm psychic, right!? I do now!
Now you do! [Laughs] Wait, what was the question because I can expand on it if you want --
Actually, it wasn't really a question. Just a note that "this is such an appropriate time for 'House of Lies' with Occupy Wall Street."
Yeah, I think it's highly relevant to the current zeitgeist. Hopefully, Wall Street doesn't clean up its act by January and we're still relevant.
I don't think you have to worry about that! [Laughs]
[Laughs]
Now, "The Hunger Games." I know you're a big fan.
It's all I think about.
Anything new in your campaign to be Johanna? Is that still happening?
I mean from my campaign desk here on my full-size bed in a back bedroom in my family's house in Oregon, there are no new developments [Laughs] -- other than the fact that I am trying to stay on top of it and not age too rapidly so that I can still be cast.
For Halloween, were you Katniss?
No, but my 30th birthday I themed after "The Hunger Games" and I put District numbers up around. I put District 4 for water over the pool. I put District 2 for electronics over the stereo and iPod. I had a blow-up castle bouncy house on the front lawn and I put The Capitol over the bouncy house. And over my front door, I put District 12. All my friends dressed as the characters and I dressed as Katniss. I was head-to-toe in spandex with a fire cape and carried a bow and arrow.
That sounds pretty damn epic.
Oh yeah, it was pretty much major. I had friends that went all out. I have friends that like do it. They do not mess around. I had friends who came as Cato and Clove and were dressed in weird sewn-together fabric leaves and army colors. They had the football black under their eyes and they had taken all the knives in their house, even the butcher knives, and wrapped them in duct tape so they wouldn't be too sharp and flung them over their body like sort of ammo lines. They had all these knives taped to them -- it was amazing. I had a couple Effie Trinkets. It was pretty exceptional. People dressed up like tracker jackers. They were like bumble bees, but with huge horns.
Next themed party I have, I need to have you plan it for me.
Oh absolutely. Themed parties are pretty awesome.
Did you watch "Homeland," by any chance?
FUCK. YES.
[Laughs] I assume that means you loved it?
I loved it, I loved it. Actually, at our Showtime party, I superfanned a couple of the cast members. I had to tone it down a bit.
I had to do the same when you called me, so I can relate.
[Laughs] Thank god you toned it down! I think it's a really great show. It really keeps me on the edge of my seat.
Did you like the finale?
I did, but I really wanted him to blow up. [Laughs] Sorry, I really did. I know he pressed the button ... but I would rather suspend my belief in reality and say like, "Oh, the plate got stuck and he didn't die because his head wasn't blown off, but he did blow up the rest of the room." You know what I mean?
Mhm. When she was getting the electroshock therapy at the end ... I was kind of heartbroken.
Oh yeah, totally heartbreaking. First of all, can we stop doing that to people? First and foremost, can we knock that off?
I agree. I think Carrie Fisher gets that done still.
Oh lord. Proof is in the pudding. OK?
What are you watching besides "Homeland"?
What are we watching ... I watch this show on National Geographic called "The Incredible Dr. Pol," because I love animal shows and I love medical shows and I feel like I'm going to explode when you combine the two. When "Emergency Vets" was on the air, I was the happiest camper around. I really like medical animal shows. "The Incredible Dr. Pol" is awesome and you can watch him do surgeries or like, shove in a prolapsed uterus on a sheep or something amazing. Why am I blanking?
Obviously, "Parenthood," right?
Obviously "Parenthood"! We have just been watching "Homeland" and "Parenthood" as of late because "Jersey Shore" is off the air. "Celebrity Rehab" is off the air. Those are our secret indulgences.
"Jersey Shore" is back in a matter of days.
Oh. My. God. I gotta go! I gotta prepare! Chris, I gotta go! If it's on soon, I've got to go. [Laughs]
It debuts on my birthday. It's exciting.
Oh my gosh! Happy birthday to you and all the guidos! I was a big fan of "Damages" when it was on, but there's so much good TV. "Homeland" and "Parenthood" are the only two we've been obsessed with recently. We watched the finale of "Homeland" the other day. All four of us in a king-sized bed -- my family and Dax all sort of snuggling up watching the finale.
I was almost on the verge of tears from anxiety, but that could've just been me.
No, you know what? My heart was beating really fast. They did such a good job with the suspense in that episode. I felt the same thing.
Do you have anything else you want to add about "House of Lies"? I feel like we've veered off completely.
Who cares! No, I don't think so. Just, I want to make the point that it's attainable. It's about management consultants, but you don't have to have a degree in management consulting to watch it. Like you don't have to be a doctor to watch "ER." At the same time, it's a fresher perspective on business because it's not about lawyers; it's not "LA Law," it's not "ER," it's something that hasn't been unveiled yet -- dirty business.

Politics News
Progressive campaigners and online activists Nita Chaudhary and Shaunna Thomas had an idea for a new kind of women's rights group: one that uses cutting-edge online advertising techniques to engage more people in the fight to end sexism in politics, media and pop culture. They were not quite ready to launch their project, called UltraViolet, and their website was not yet running when the news broke that Susan G. Komen for the Cure had pulled cancer screening grants from Planned Parenthood over abortion politics. Feeling that this could be their moment to grab women's attention, Ultraviolet leapt into action, launching its first campaign with Moveon.org to call on Komen to reverse its decision and gathering 60,000 signatures in just a few hours. Komen reversed its decision two days later, Komen executive Karen Handel resigned, and Chaudhary and Thomas suddenly found themselves at the helm of a rapidly growing women's rights community. "We went from a tiny organization with a few thousand members to a quarter million strong, with members in every state and congressional district," Chaudhary told Huffpost. "The right wing decided to escalate a bubbling war on women, and hundreds of thousands of people came out of the woodwork to fight back with UltraViolet."
UltraViolet, which is funded by the progressive nonprofit Citizen Engagement Lab, has already gathered 300,000 members in less than two months of existence, making it clear to the women's rights community that the days of organizing sit-ins at local courthouses and knocking on doors to gather signatures are long over. While its founders say that UltraViolet is not intended to replace the important women's advocacy groups that already exist, such as the National Organization of Women, they are using social media in new and unique ways to reach more people. "Women needed far more vehicles for making their views heard," Thomas said. "It's a nimble, lean organization using newer online advertising tactics and rapid response to create truly in-the-moment, media-driven campaigns. Our goal isn't to replace or replicate what organizations are already doing, but to reach more people and bring more voices into the space."
Since the Komen debacle, UltraViolet has found numerous reasons to rile up its members. It was the first group to call for advertisers to ditch Rush Limbaugh's show after he called Georgetown student Sandra Fluke a "slut," and that petition collected more than 160,000 signatures. More than 40 advertisers have peeled off the show so far, including ProFlowers, which Ultraviolet singled out as an organization that primarily serves women. Another petition circulated by UltraViolet, asking Congress not to repeal President Obama's birth control coverage mandate, received 75,000 signatures in a few hours, and 10,000 people submitted personal stories of how birth control is vital to them. And Thomas and Chaudhary are now trying to escalate a campaign to stop former director of the White House National Economic Council Larry Summers from heading the World Bank. "We know laws and elections aren't going to end sexism alone," Thomas said. "We need to shift our fundamental culture, the products we buy, what we see on TV. Last year, we jumped on a story about how iPhone's Siri couldn't find an abortion provider in New York City and would push people to crisis pregnancy centers, and it resulted in 30,000 signatures overnight and eight major stories. A good lesson for us there is that culture matters, and that's going to be a core focus over the next year."
With so much debate in the culture around women's health issues lately, the ground is particularly fertile for an up-and-coming women's rights group to reach and engage women in all corners of the country, who otherwise wouldn't be paying attention to politics. So far, Chaudhary and Thomas are the only two people involved in Ultraviolet's day-to-day operations, but Chaudhary said they're "looking to build up pretty quickly" and become a major player in the 2012 elections. "The GOP war on women is so horrifying, it's essentially spawned this new community of people saying, 'Wait a minute, this is 2012. We want to take action to oppose this stuff,'" Thomas said. "As awesome as the tools are and as much experience we have, it's more the environment we're launching in that's really conducive to mobilizing women."

Given recent events surrounding the vicious attacks on women's health in the Senate, in the House and on the radio airwaves, I have turned to music to help me express why it is so crucial to elect more women who will stand up for our rights and for the respect we deserve. Chris Weigant: Friday Talking Points -- "Hands Off My Uterus!"
They don't wear funny hats any more, but there still sure are a lot of Puritans in this country these days. It wouldn't surprise me if you told me some red state is going to force every woman who gets birth control to wear a scarlet letter. Most Popular

We often think of television as the true "mass media" when in actuality it's anything but: with the exception of a few worldwide events, most programs are seen by just a small percentage of the world's population. And citizens of one country rarely get access to the full programming of even their neighboring nations. As the web changes video forever, and with it the fundamental DNA of entertainment, we're seeing the debut of a true global living room. Here are three ways that web video disrupted the status quo:
Audience and reach
Historically, television broadcasters have been confined to the national borders they operate in. This forced them to develop very specific sets of entertainment for very specific audiences. Much of the production work around this programming was guess work, with TV executives basing success on hunches of what their local audience wanted. Sometimes they were right and the entertainment they pushed out was a huge hit. Most of the time, however, they were not and their show would fail to find an audience and be canceled. With the web, content owners can reach a global audience on a single platform with a few clicks. And because the Internet encourages sharing, every person in the world can write a new headline for your movie and build you an audience. These people, in turn, send signals back to the content producer and these signals help them better understand both the audience as a whole and each individual member who makes up that whole. For example, as we saw in 2010, a movie studio in India can release a feature film on web to the world and learn not only that their movie has a following in Estonia, but that the Estonian fan base is made up primarily of men between the ages of 25-30 who happen to love the movie's chase scenes best of all. Having a platform that can reach so many with such immediacy is a powerful thing. Couple this reach with a truer understanding of what audiences both within your country and beyond it are drawn to and you create the beginnings of tectonic shift in entertainment.
Cultural understanding through engagement Ten years ago, a child in Colombia may have imagined what the sand dunes in the heart of the Sahara Desert looked like. Finding such a thing on the television would be difficult, if not impossible. He could read about it in a newspaper, or even stumble upon photos of it in a copy of National Geographic. But no medium is more immediate, or more visceral than video. Video -- even a grainy video shot from cell phones in a marketplace that's just erupted into chaos -- puts the viewer instantly and unavoidably in the moment. Ever wonder what a sunset in El Salvador looks like, or what it's like to test driving a Lamborghini on the German Autobahn? Ever witness a Zulu tribal dance? Today, web video transports you from the small place in front of your screen to almost anywhere in the world you want to go. In doing so, it literally and figuratively offers new perspectives and fosters greater cultural understanding. This sense of commonality effortlessly created through clicks on the Web is what the producers of the film Life in a Day sought to capture: a single day acted out through thousands of individuals across hundreds of countries and geographies. The result is a time capsule showing the shared experiences of humanity. How the Web Makes Creating and Creativity Viral
In the age before the web, a good idea often stayed local. Occasionally, it would break out and spread to other towns, or countries, but the law of averages and of nature kept ideas and their impact close to the thinker. Today, the web creates communities bound by common interests not national borders. In this ecosystem creativity around video has thrived. When a person shares a video, she is not just sharing a moment, she is sharing a technique for capturing that moment on camera. These techniques and ideas -- memes -- are noticed, adopted by another, and altered, one riffing on another and another. And so evolves the creative process. This is the democratizing of video creativity. In the traditional entertainment model, projects needed to be reviewed and greenlighted. This meant only a tiny minority's creative expression saw the light of day and found an audience. The Web has changed the model around entertainment. Techniques and skills once held by a cadre of experienced producers and cinematographers are now distributed to the masses and the masses, in turn, adapt the techniques to develop new forms of video entertainment and creativity at a rate faster than ever before. When YouTube released a feature called Annotations, we never imagined the new and gripping directions the community would take it. Few would believe that thousands of instructional videos on how to play instruments could be transformed into a single work of musical art. Or that a single tilt effect could create a massive following of similar videos each uniquely compelling in their own right. Collectively, this community helps evolve not only the distribution, but the creation of video faster than ever before. The results are videos like the one created by Uruguayan Frederico Alvarez who, with little to no professional training, produced a special effects-laden video that would get him recognized and recruited by Hollywood. The world's imagination is unlocked and access to audience is gated by your talent, not your zip code. Today, nearly 8 years of video are uploaded to YouTube every day. This mass of video reflects the deep desire of people to reach out, connect and share their experiences with the world in the hope of finding an audience. Today, the audience and the creator are one and this combination, brought to you by the internet, has forever transformed the world of entertainment. Are you creating for this new global living room? If you're not, you should be.

This year's Lollapalooza festival kicks off on August 3 in Chicago's Grant Park, and to get you in the mood, the team at Tablet has created a special 10-song preview of this year's lineup. Of course, with three days of music across five separate stages, your personal itinerary will surely vary -- but any time you can manage to see the likes of Sharon Van Etten, The Shins, Jack White and The Black Keys all in the same weekend, you're doing something right.
For those of you who didn't score tickets, there's still hope. Tablet has teamed up with Flavorpill to send a pair of lucky guests to this year's festival: airfare, VIP passes and lodging at Public Chicago all included. Follow Tablet on Twitter:
