The Supreme Court revealed to the world on Wednesday, April 28, 2010, an extraordinary religious extremism that belies any quaint notion of judicial restraint. If the obvious ever needed to be emphasized, the call to replace Justice John Paul Stevens with a liberal jurist is now more critical than ever.
The case in question is a bit convoluted, but the details are important. A seven-foot cross was erected on Sunrise Rock in 1934 on government-owned land in the Mojave Desert to honor fallen veterans. The metal display has been repaired and replaced many times since, with the latest renovation completed in 1998. A former National Park Service employee, Frank Buono, sued to have the cross removed as an offensive symbol to all non-Christian soldiers and their surviving families. In response to this challenge, Congress offered yet another violation of the Establishment Clause by using sleazy slight-of-hand to circumvent the Constitution. Congress sold a little plot of land on which the cross rests to a veterans group, thereby claiming that the cross no longer stood on federal property. But the transparent ploy of gutting the Constitution by creating an island of private property surrounding by a National Park did not fool the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled the cross had to come down. Our largely Catholic Supreme Court then decided to hear the case.
Justice Antonin Scalia explained that he agreed to put this case on the court docket because he was simply baffled that a Christian cross could be construed to represent Christianity. He was puzzled that a cross was not broadly representative of Islam, Judaism or no religion at all. Scalia went on to proclaim that a cross self-evidently represented all war dead, not just fallen Christians. To demonstrate how terribly twisted Scalia's thoughts are in reaching this peculiar conclusion, he earlier asked the ridiculous question, "What would you have them erect? Some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Muslim half moon and star?" Note that Scalia did not offer the obvious and imminently more reasonable alternative of erecting the Crescent of Islam in place of the cross. He only suggested the absurd notion of a chimera. He is so utterly blinded by his faith that he could not imagine that anything other than a cross could serve to honor our soldiers. But the assertion that the cross represents everybody is extraordinarily bizarre, defying even the most basic elements of decency. Would a Jew opt to carve a cross on his grave? Would a Muslim? How about Justice Kennedy; would he himself allow a Star of David on his grave? If a Christian would not select a Star of David then why on earth would a Jew choose a cross? Yet that is exactly what the Court proposes. The court is fundamentally wrong. How outrageously and horribly offensive to every non-Christian to be informed by a bunch of old Catholic men that the cross is a "universal symbol" representative of all religions. No ruling from the Court in modern history has been more radical, or more poorly argue.
The trend toward religious extremism was evident even before the case was heard, so the outcome was preordained. Therefore, when finally decided in a 5-4 vote by the deeply divided Supremes, the case as expected was sent back to the lower court for new hearings. The logic offered by the ultimate court in the land is so contorted my body hurts just reading the nonsense. Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his final ruling that those "who erected the cross intended simply to honor our nation's fallen soldiers." Kennedy then dug deeper with the following breathtaking leap into the ridiculous: "Although certainly a Christian symbol, the cross was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian message." Really? If Kennedy's logic is sound, then the following statement would also be true: "Although certainly a Muslim symbol, the Crescent Moon and Star was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote an Islamic message." If the Jewish symbol had been erected on the mountain would Kennedy claim the action was not done to promote a Jewish message? The answer is obvious. Kennedy's argument implies absurdly that a religion's symbol does not uniquely represent that religion, so that any one symbol can substitute equally for another. But we know that he really means that only the Christian cross can be universally representative while every other religious symbol cannot. Can anybody honestly imagine that the ruling would be the same if the cross were in fact instead an Islamic Crescent? Of course not, because these symbols would not represent the faith of all the fallen soldiers. As Justice Stevens wrote, "I certainly agree that the nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died in WWI, but it cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a starkly sectarian message."
This decision, and more importantly the rationale provided to justify the ruling, is a radical departure from traditional judicial thought. What the conservative justices did here makes each the worst kind of "activist judge" they so loudly disdain, reinterpreting the Constitution to conform to a narrow and radical religious view self-evidently in contradiction to the intent of our founding fathers. Scalia and his brethren are brazenly choosing one religion over all others in direct violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
In addition to ignoring our Bill of Rights, the Justices have abandoned any pretense of logic to support their faith. The three other who ruled with Kennedy and Scalia are Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. All five are Catholic. Three of the four dissenting voices are non-Catholic.
Those four dissenting justices are Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and John Paul Stevens. The latter's reasoned plea for sanity in calling the Christian cross a "starkly sectarian message" underlies the urgent necessity of replacing him with a thoughtful liberal untainted by the curse of religious zealotry. We have few remaining opportunities to stop the march of conservative activist judges who are shredding the Constitution to implement their vision of a Christian nation. They and their rightist allies on the Hill are destroying the very institutions they so proudly claim to be defending by working to weaken or destroy the separation of church and state. If not stopped, our country will soon resemble nothing like the shining example envisioned by our founders. For in spite of these increasingly popular efforts to claim the nation was founded on Christian principles, the original manuscripts prove that idea blatantly and demonstrably false. Our forefathers were unambiguous in their efforts to exclude god from government. That cannot be disputed based on their own words. For the first 180 years of existence, the United States never included god in its motto, on its currency, or in any document creating the republic. We were born a secular nation and remained one for nearly two centuries. Until Roberts, Alito and Scalia hijacked our highest court in the name of religious intolerance.
Forcing a dead soldier's family to accept the symbol of one religion over another is establishing religion by any definition. We are better than that. Or should be: no matter the outcome of the new hearings in the Sunrise Rock case, we know that our government, when opportunity came, clearly chose Christianity to the exclusion of all other faiths, with not even a nod to checks and balances. We continue to edge ever closer to the status of a banana republic theocracy. Shame on us.

Note: Do not read on if you have not yet seen Season 6, Episode 5 of AMC's "Mad Men," titled "The Flood."
Since it debuted, "Mad Men" has been very good at misdirection. In fact, when I've dinged various episodes in the last year or two, it's often been because they've been short on subtlety. It's not that I require the show to be stealthy all the time -- I actually tend to enjoy "Mad Men" most when it's mixing up tones, moods, structures and styles -- but when the symbolism clangs too loudly or meanings are too overt, it can throw the whole thing off and the stories can start to feel a bit didactic. The show is rightly celebrated for its ambiguity, which isn't to say that episodes that jump headlong into current affairs are failures. They're usually among the show's stronger outings, as was the case with "The Flood."
To put it more briefly, "Mad Men" was quite devious and very obvious this week, and both strategies were deployed well. The misdirection had to do with the first quarter of the hour, when it looked as though we were in for a typical "Mad Men" hour. We started with the show's signature back-of-the-head shot of Peggy, who was checking out a new apartment. Don and Megan soon headed out to an awards dinner, and Michael Ginsberg came home to find out he'd been set up on a blind date by his dad. So far, so typical: Most episodes focus on a few characters, and the opening scenes gave us no indications that anything out of the ordinary would happen -- which sometimes means that we should brace ourselves for a major event. Since there's no clear pattern regarding when the show will spring those big events on us, the sheer normality of the opening served as camouflage for what was about to happen. Various bits of business occurred at the award ceremony itself that were both typical and distracting: Don avoided Peggy, Megan greeted Peggy, the gang commented on the awful placement of their table, etc. Three things in a row pulled focus even further away from the potential content of the episode itself: that creepy Ethan from "Lost" turned out to be an out-to-lunch weirdo. Also, Harry Hamlin showed up as Ted Chaugh's partner Jim Cutler, and I have to believe we'll be seeing him again (if you're over the age of 40, you probably spent the next few minutes gasping, "Holy shit, that's Harry Hamlin! Harry Hamlin is on 'Mad Men'!" If you were never an "L.A. Law" fan, you may not have had that reaction, but trust me, many of your fellow viewers did.) We were barely able to process the appearance of Hamlin before we all began squinting, as did Joan and the rest of the SCCP employees, to see if we could see Paul Newman. Of course, our rational brains knew that "Mad Men" would never even attempt to show us the iconic visage of 1968 Paul Newman up close, but come on -- it's Paul Newman! We were craning our neck and squinting with the best of them, and we were so concerned with rubbernecking that we were barely thinking about "Mad Men" as a TV show at all. Just when our distraction was set to absolute maximum, "Mad Men" lowered the boom. As it has done on a few occasions in the past, it dwelled extensively on national tragedy and showed how it affected (or didn't affect) a whole range of characters. Which 1960s events will be dealt with in glancing fashion and which ones will get much more serious exposure? The fact that we never know usually makes the impact of the "current events" episodes even greater. Certainly, if the show were going to deal with one huge national event this season, this was the one to focus on. The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was an enormous event that affected the course of American history. Thanks to the various strategies employed by the show, the news felt as though it came from nowhere (though, as more than one character noted, it's not as if such an event hadn't been predicted). Even if we had speculated before the season began about whether this enormous incident would be discussed during the season, thanks to "The Flood's" stealthiness, the events of that April day felt like a bolt from the blue. And that was completely intentional, given how stunned people were then. That event mentally dislocated most people and left them feeling bereft, afraid and unsure of what to do next. Many of us were probably too young to remember that awful day, but those who were old enough to process it probably still remember it vividly. And even those of us aware or alive then can draw on our memories of other horrific moments in American history. It was unsettling, to say the least, to see characters glued to news coverage, as we were just a week or so ago when events in Boston played themselves out. At moments like that, we look at the screen and feel both numb and a dozen roiling emotions. Just like Don. Surely we can all relate to the moments of reassessment that took place in many of the characters' lives. Tragedy forces people to take a hard look at what they value and why; it stops everything and compels people to think about what rules matter, what they want and where they're going. Things don't look the same, and even if they get back to a kind of normal, people have been altered -- at least some of them. You know it's a world gone terribly awry when Pete Campbell seems like a good guy. Actually, that statement is a bit too facetious. Pete is indeed a world-class jackass much of the time, but he's always been remarkably forward-thinking and egalitarian when it comes to matters of race. Think back to his astonishment when the firm brushed off his attempts to pursue African-American consumers. That kind of bias struck him as both dumb and unfair. When it comes to work matters, Pete has generally been fairly level-headed and realistic, and he knew that, if nothing else, racism was simply bad for business. Clearly his dressing down of Harry was partly driven by the loneliness he's felt since Trudy kicked him out of the house -- the idea of a family being torn apart wounded him in part due to the dicey state of his marriage. But I like to think there are a few shreds of something like decency in Pete Campbell, and he really was just sickened by Harry's insensitive and thoughtless comments. If SCDP goes out of business one day, it's because the company is being run not by people who really understand the new generation coming up, but by people who don't want primetime programming interfered with for any reason. Harry and Pete both may be unhappy, skirt-chasing ad men, but their loud confrontation reminded us how very different they are at their cores. It's hard to think of this kind of tragedy prompting the blinkered Harry into trying to make a real connection with another human being, particularly someone of another race. Pete tried that with the man delivering his Chinese food near the end of the hour, but it didn't work out. Was that attempt at conversation driven by the fact that Pete was lonely? Was it prompted by the enormity of the news itself? By the fact that the man was Chinese? It's hard to say, but it didn't work. Likewise, Pete's phone call with Trudy didn't break down her resolve to avoid him as much as possible. Pete and Trudy, Pete and the delivery man, Pete and Harry: Notice a theme? Soon after the news of the assassination broke, group scenes became something of a rarity. There was the meeting with Marshall and a few other scenes with three or more people, but most of the scenes in the rest of the episode featured two people. Two by two, as happened when people boarded the Ark during the flood. This being "Mad Men," most of the pairings weren't quite in harmony. However, shaken out of their complacency, some characters made a kind of progress in their lives. Don and Bobby shared some reasonably decent father-son bonding time, even if, as Don admitted to Megan, the fact that he had no examples of positive parental intimacy means he's often terrible at it. Both Peggy and Abe took opportunities as a result of the week's tragic events: Abe got an assignment from The New York Times and Peggy allowed herself to be steered into underbidding on an apartment. The latter strategy backfired, but at least it led to a conversation with Abe about their future, which he sees as involving kids. This was news to Peggy, who's spent a lot of her life steeling herself for disappointment. It's hard not to have my heart tied up in knots when Peggy looks as hopeful as she did after Abe mentioned the prospect of children. I desperately want Peggy to have hope in her life (and she clearly desires at least some of the conventional life that she was raised to want). But I can't help but feel that, as with the case with the apartment, Peggy and Abe are not "meant to be." In my view, Peggy is settling for this guy, and because she's awesome, I want more for her than she wants for herself. But experience has been a harsh teacher, as evidenced by Peggy's intermittent desire to tamp down her exuberant smile. Oh Pegs. I want more for you, but I also fear that you want more than you're going to be able to handle. Henry also came to a realization about wanting to further his political ambitions and Betty was tantalized by the possibility of her status improving if Husband No. 2 ascends the political ladder, but I'll be honest: I'm more fascinated by the lint in the lint trap of my dryer than anything to do with Henry and Betty. Moving on. More misdirection: Randall Walsh is obviously a Complete Loon, thus his scenes were played somewhat for laughs. (There are few things I enjoy more than watching a very stoned Stan Rizzo contemplate ridiculous people and things.) But there was also a lot of truth to what he said, certainly about Don's desire not to look at anything honestly. It's true: Don would rather ignore the obvious, cloak things in spin, and ignore the fact that he's an animal crying out in pain. Of course Randall's desire to shove the Truth in people's faces -- with an ad that said, more or less, "Buy my insurance in case your building gets torched!" -- is a terrible idea, and the team rightly regards it with varying levels of incredulity. (Having said that, Stan was probably thinking, "This guy's awesome! I have to find out where he gets his drugs!") But Randall was just another reminder that the kind of elegant obfuscation that is Don's stock in trade is largely going by the wayside. Don keeps encountering people who assault his worldview -- hippies, rock chicks, swingers, drugged-out weirdos -- and if, like Harry, he thinks this is all going to stop soon, he's got another thing coming. "This cannot be made good," Pete snarls, and he's right. More and more these days, characters are finding themselves on the opposite sides of unbridgeable gulfs. Pete and Harry may shake hands, but they use that moment to say even more furious things to each other, and Bert's attempts at placating them are exceptionally ineffectual. Bert, the voice of reason, a man who could stop contentious meetings cold with one or two well-placed words in the past, is now regarded more or less as a house plant that talks. Feelings run too deep these days, and the go-along, get-along attitude of Bert's generation (and that of Roger and Don's generations) just isn't going to work miracles anymore. Nor are hugs a panacea for anything. It was interesting to regard the various awkward hugs in the episode: Don hugged Megan as she wept at the awards ceremony, but he looked blank and his actions felt mechanical. Joan, who's of a similar age, looked even more awkward trying to hug a surprised Dawn. That sort of emotional moment doesn't come easily to Don or Joan, especially with employees, and the Dawn scene reflected that (Don didn't even attempt to hug her, which felt more right than Joan's well-intentioned but strange embrace). Peggy, who's more than a decade younger than Joan and Don, looked far more natural embracing her secretary Phyllis, even if it's clear that the women are not really friends, nor are they ever likely to be friends. That awful day made the black and white characters realize just how big a gap still remained between them. Peggy is clearly a well-intentioned person, but the road to hell, as they say, is paved with good intentions. As she did with Dawn last year, Peggy tripped herself up; in this case, she referred to what occurred in the city as "not as bad" as it could have been. There were a host of assumptions contained in that statement, and both she and Phyllis knew it, but as was the case when Dawn stayed over last year, after a moment of awkwardness, both women chose to ignore what passed between then. In different ways though, Joan, Peggy, Pete and Don were trying to bridge gulfs with people. But given how self-absorbed and/or work-focused these people typically are, their efforts were only partially successful. Still, they tried, and that counts for something, even though it was clear most people were out of their depth, uncertain and uncomfortable. Don may have been able to bridge the gap between himself and his older son a little, and possibly decrease the distance between his wife and himself, but he was very much alone on that balcony. The sirens sounded close, but his loved ones -- including Sylvia -- felt very far away. A few more notes and observations: Speaking of Sylvia, one of the sources of suspense for this episode was wondering how everything turned out for her and her husband. The episode left us hanging when it came to that couple, but I think that actually worked in "The Flood's" favor. This was an episode all about feeling fractured and unsettled, and it made sense for Don to still feel off-kilter when it ended. What didn't work for me: I didn't believe that Betty, despite being the worst, would really want her kids in the city, to the point of not letting Don just come and get them the next day. Betty may be a horrid mother sometimes, but that seemed unreasonable, even for her. What an ungainly plot contrivance. Another thing that didn't quite work for me: Jon Hamm's performance was typically powerful in the last Don-Megan scene, but her tears at his confession about his own father were jarring. We've seen Don pull this move before -- confide just enough about his past to keep whoever he's with on the hook and hopeful that they might receive another crumb of intimacy someday. It's hard to explain my reaction to that scene: It's not that I think Don was consciously manipulating Megan, but we've seen that kind of thing from Don so often that it's hard for it not to feel at least a little cynical about it. And Megan, the guy who you're crying for? He was an absolute shit to you quite recently in your dressing room. Obviously the couple patched things up after he confronted her about her love scenes, but her deep sympathy is somewhat hard to buy, given recently we saw him being awful to her. But maybe when a gal has a withholding Marxist for a father, anything's possible. There was a Look between Peggy and Ted at that awards banquet. I wasn't alone in catching how significantly they looked at each other, was I? Also notice how eager Ted seemed to be to sit next to her -- but of course he had to engage in negging to counteract his obvious interest. His interest in his wife, by the way, seemed pretty fake. As we saw when the camera showed Megan's award, Don and Megan (and presumably Peggy) did stay for the rest of the ceremony, which seems odd, but somehow in keeping with the fact that denial was more of a thing then. I loved Roger's deadpan reaction to Randall's imitation of Tecumseh: "I had forgotten that." Clueless Betty is still clueless: Bobby's peeling of the wallpaper pre-dates the week's huge news, but she blames it on current events rather than anything else going on in his life. This week in Whatever Could That Symbol Mean: The wallpaper, which is meant to cover up what came before, is not aligned! The child peels it away to cover what's underneath! That couldn't be a subtle nod to the fact that Betty's new family is full of mismatched people trying to forget who they used to be, could it? I wonder! Prediction: Jim Cutler & Roger Sterling will meet in a future episode and have a silver fox-off. Then they will go on an epic secretary-chasing bender. When you want a character to give off a "Danger: Here is a Very Weird Guy, Possibly With a Head in His Freezer" vibe, you cast William Mapother, who's possibly best known as the ultra-creepy Ethan on "Lost." Based on the charm he displayed on his big date with Beverley, Ginsburg is going to remain a virgin for some time to come. His running commentary on what a terrible date he was, however, was pretty amusing. "The man knew how to talk. I don't know why but I thought that would save him." Figures Roger would want another man who was very good with words to survive. Update: I wrote this Sunday night, finishing at around 3 a.m., and as I write this list item on Monday morning, I realize that I didn't really deal with "Planet of the Apes" at all. I'll leave it to insightful commenters and other critics -- parsing the symbology there (aside from New York living up to Harry's worst nightmare and going to hell in a handbag). I don't know about you, but I felt echoes of "The Grown-Ups," the Season 3 episode in which the characters reacted to the JFK assassination, in "The Flood." I haven't watched "The Grown-Ups" recently, but I seem to recall that hour having a similarly charged vibe. Of course there is a wealth of historical information about Dr. King's life and death available, but I want to mention one of those resources. The Smithsonian Channel's "MLK: The Assassination Tapes," which won a Peabody Award this year, is an hourlong documentary that uses only audio recordings and video footage from 1968 -- much of it from local news media -- of the coverage of King's visit to Memphis and the aftermath of his death. It's a fascinating on-the-ground chronicle of what actually happened in Memphis that spring.

The latest document dump once again has put WikiLeaks in a rather unpredictable situation. As much as they may be intending to release documents in order to take "lying, corrupt and murderous leadership" to task, the fuller effect of the leak is far from clear. Pundits and commentators argue whether the release is specifically harmful to national security or good for transparent democracy, but government secrecy experts like Steven Aftergood recognize that, as much as anything, the WikiLeaks project is an assault on the very system of government secrecy, a system that has "exceeded rational boundaries." Others like Slate's Anne Applebaum say WikiLeaks has inadvertently struck a blow to "frank speech," adding, "[d]on't expect better government from these revelations, expect deeper secrets." This complex and ironic predicament is nothing new in the cultural life of government secrecy: efforts to both conceal and reveal government activities have often come with unintended consequences.
Stretching back many decades now, government secrecy has kept emerging in pop culture -- through storylines and characters -- in ways that impact public perceptions of what government does and how it operates. These stories even have their secrecy villains, from Nixon to Bush, and their transparency heroes, from Ellsberg, to Woodward and Bernstein, to now, most recently, WikiLeaks. Time and again, these stories strike upon similar themes: certain government activities are consistently held secret, often for good reason, but also, at times, to cover up actual wrongdoing.
One of the most well-recognized instances of government secrecy in pop culture has been the redacted document, scribbled over with the government's black marker. And yet the irony is that redaction is not, as many might believe, part of a censorship law designed to increase secrecy, but a bureaucratic innovation designed to actually increase transparency. When passed in 1966, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) originally had no use for black markers. Because it was so full of loopholes, advocacy groups in the early 1970's, like Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, proposed amendments to the law to make it more effective. The public's outrage about Watergate helped propel these proposed amendments into law, part of a historical cycle of apparent increased government transparency wedged between periods of more accepted secrecy. One of the loopholes federal agencies had been taking advantage of was refusing to release a document if just one small part of the document -- even one sentence in a lengthy report -- was deemed secret. A 1974 amendment demanded that FOIA officers "redact" those portions of a document that the government deemed secret and release the rest of the document, assuming that the non-redacted segments still provided meaningful content. For decades, bureaucrats accomplished this task with a black marker, though today redaction is more often drawn on a computer. Despite its actual history, black marker redaction has taken on a life of its own as a powerful symbol of overbearing government secrecy and state censorship. Today, it is a commonly employed design motif, seen in such disparate places as a book cover for Shahriar Mandanipour's 2009 novel Censoring An Iranian Love Story and Brian de Palma's 2007 film Redacted. Not uncommon in the pages of major newspapers, redacted documents remind us of the government's paternalistic capacity to lord its knowledge over us. No wonder then that one of literature's most famous critiques of governmental absurdity, Catch-22, would prominently feature a scene with its anti-hero Yossarian wielding a black marker to redact soldiers' letters home, thus exposing the essential ridiculousness of government secrecy: Death to all modifiers, [Yossarian] declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt, and in just about every case left a message far more universal.
What Joseph Heller recognized that government bureaucrats cannot seem to wrap their heads around is that government secrecy is never simply like a faucet, which would let information flow or not. When we become aware of government secrecy -- as we do through redaction -- this also tends to raise our consciousness about the exercise of power and especially the potential abuse of that power. Black marker redaction doesn't stop communication. It is an invitation for suspicion, skepticism and paranoid interpretation. The word may be gone, but a form and trace remains. We become aware that we cannot know something that we want to know--and that gets us wanting to know why we can't know. And this is actually a very healthy kind of paranoia for a democratic society to have.
The situation I'm outlining might remind some readers of the complex words of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, responding to reports that there was no evidence of a link between terrorists and Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq back in 2002. As he put it: There are known knowns; there are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns; there are things we do not know we don't know.
While black marker redaction thankfully gives the public some sense of our known unknowns about government activities, what is truly disconcerting should be a fourth category of "unknown knowns." These are the facts that the government knows, but the public is completely unaware of, because no hint of their presence ever gets communicated to us, even indirectly.
And this kind of secrecy casts a shadow on the transformation of governance in recent decades that Janine Wedel explores in her book Shadow Elite. She notes that 75 percent of the federal workforce is now made up of government contractors who range from low-level workers to the very heights of power. That includes people like a Treasury Department "contractor" who was reportedly a key player in nearly every aspect of the 2008 financial bailout. Whose interests was he representing? That may never become clear. And unfortunately, transparency laws like FOIA often fail to cover the full scope of private contractors' activities, because the "trade secrets" of private companies are largely exempt from disclosure. And what about U.S.-paid contractors who outnumber U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, and, in Iraq, make up nearly half of the combined contractor and military personnel workforce? Again, some of their activities would be difficult to uncover through FOIA -- either because of exemptions, informal refusals to comply with FOIA on the part of private contractors or a lack of awareness among FOIA requestors that such documents, or even such contractors, exist in the first place. And in many cases, the influence of unofficial, unaccountable power brokers may go completely undocumented, with their actions known only to themselves and a handful of others. This would render FOIA irrelevant. How do you expose government secrets that go undocumented? Even WikiLeaks might be stumped on that "unknown known". Most Popular
