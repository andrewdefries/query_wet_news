Former Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin spoke Wednesday night about the positives of the establishment-shaking victory of Rand Paul, the Tea Party and Palin-supported GOP candidate for Kentucky Senate.
Appearing on the Fox Business Channel, Palin acknowledged Paul's libertarian leanings and said they were a net positive.
"Seeing kind of that libertarian streak of his -- that is what we need to balance out the leftist liberal overreach of government that's in power right now," Palin said. "Rand's gonna be great, plus on social issues, right there, he's got some great positions."
Later Wednesday evening, Rand Paul spoke with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow to discuss the same intersection of libertarian and social values that Palin had earlier praised.
When the conversation came to the Civil Rights Act and its mandate prohibiting racial discrimination in the workplace, Rand Paul said that this was a component of the bill that he would have argued against.
Should we limit speech from people we find abhorrent. Should we limit racists from speaking. I don't want to be associated with those people, but I also don't want to limit their speech in any way in the sense that we tolerate boorish and uncivilized behavior because that's one of the things that freedom requires is that we allow people to be boorish and uncivilized, but that doesn't mean we approve of it.
[...]
Well what it gets into then is if you decide that restaurants are publicly owned and not privately owned, then do you say that you should have the right to bring your gun into a restaurant even though the owner of the restaurant says 'well no, we don't want to have guns in here' the bar says 'we don't want to have guns in here because people might drink and start fighting and shoot each-other.' Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant? Or does the government own his restaurant?

Harry Shearer: The Rand Paul Quote Everybody's Ignoring
The political spin on Paul is that he's worrisome because he's not within the standard lines of the modern political debate. I'd suggest he's worrisome because he is. Eddie Glaude, Jr., Ph.D.: Rand Paul and the Souls of Some White Folks
Some will argue, as many have, that Rand Paul's comments about Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act were consistent with his libertarian principles. However, freedom-talk without justice-talk is empty and, potentially, dangerous.	Bruce Wilson: Rand Paul Keynoted 2009 Rally for Far-Right Constitution Party
In April of last year, Dr. Rand Paul was the featured guest speaker at an event held by the Constitution Party of Minnesota, whose stated goals include "restor[ing] American jurisprudence to its Biblical foundations."	David Sirota: What Dems Don't Want Mentioned in the Rand Paul/Civil Rights Debate
Those same Democrats expressing outrage at Paul's criticism of the Civil Rights Act have no problem accepting a deregulated labor market that lets employers fire and discriminate against you for all sorts of preposterous reasons.	Jake Berliner: The Practical and Economic Bankruptcy of Rand Paul's Lunch Counter Libertarianism
While Paul's lunch counter libertarianism disgusts us, it is his economic libertarianism that truly imperils us.	Jacob Heilbrunn: Dr. Rand Paul Can't See Straight
The problem with Rand Paul isn't that he is a racist. It is that he is a fool. The upside is that Paul's primary victory will ensure that, if nothing else, the Kentucky race will continue to provide ample political fodder for the rest of the year.
Dan Manatt: Can President Obama Sit at Rand Paul's Lunch Counter? Can John Roberts and Nino Scalia? and Other Reasons Jack Conway Must Be Kentucky's Next Senator
Paul set himself up to be 2010's Barry Goldwater -- whose radical libertarianism turns him from right wing darling to general election loser. Only in 1964, Goldwater's views weren't counter to nearly 50 years of settled Supreme Court law. Around the Web:

Most brides just want to find "the one" when it comes to wedding dresses.
But for "Say Yes To The Dress: Big Bliss" bride Linda Fillippi, one-upping her sister seems more important than finding the perfect gown for her Big Day.
In this clip from "Big Bliss," the plus-sized bride explains why she feels the need to compete: "People still talk about her wedding, and it's almost two years later," says Fillippi. "So we just need to top that." Even when Fillippi finds a wedding dress that she likes, it seems to fall short of her sister's. "This one is like hers but toned down more, and I don't want that," Fillippi tells the Kleinfeld Bridal associate. "I already told her about the need to top her."
See what happens next on "Say Yes To The Dress: Big Bliss" Friday, Nov. 25 at 9 pm EST on TLC.

On the Season 2 Premiere of "Coming Home" (Sun., 10 p.m. EST on Lifetime) viewers met SFC Michael Eaton, his wife Tonya and their four kids. In the six years Michael and Tonya had been married, he had been deployed overseas three times.
During the Oakland Raider's fan's latest deployment to Afghanistan, Tonya and their four kids were missing Michael very much, and they had no idea that when they flew out to California to attend a Raiders game that they would get a very special surprise.
At halftime Tonya and the kids were brought onto the field so the boys could kick a field goal. However, to their astonishment the player holding the ball was none other than their dad.
As the kids cried and hugged him, it was a truly heart-warming homecoming.
Season 2 of "Coming Home" continues each Sunday at 10 p.m. EST on Lifetime.
TV Replay scours the vast television landscape to find the most interesting, amusing, and, on a good day, amazing moments, and delivers them right to your browser.

It's been said a great photograph should capture the attitude, the soul and the mind of a great moment. It is that millisecond where the eye, the mind and the heart combine. It is the type of photograph we all love, photographer or not. Musical superstars have long been the subject of some of the most iconic photography of our time. The Beatles, Madonna, Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Michael Jackson. As you read the names I'm pretty sure you can see the images I'm talking about. This week,V&M.com, the online marketplace known for their exclusive collections of art, design and vintage items, threw a celebrity filled preview party at The Darby in NYC to celebrate the launch of The V&M Rock Shop, curated by Andy Hilfiger. It feels like a very appropriate partnership, given the fact that Hilfiger has been blending the worlds of music and fashion for decades. He selected 17 photographs from Rock Paper Photo's inventory of museum-quality images of musicians who are also known for their blend of the music and fashion worlds. The collection consists of iconic shots of early Prince, Madonna and Mick Jagger, just to name a few. All of the photographs from Rock Paper Photo capture and preserve some of the music world's greatest moments and each hand-signed print is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. For anyone with a love of great photography and music, this is a must see collection.
Andy's band, MARS performed and in attendance were brother Tommy Hilfiger, and musical world fixtures, Russell Simmons, Marky Ramone, Scott Lipps and Mia Tyler.
I attended the event and spoke with Andy, VandM and lots of other interesting people along the way. See my interviews (and other candid moments) here.
To view the collection in it's entirety, visit The V&M Rock Shop. You can find style expert, Courtney Cachet's frequent appearances national TV, where she dishes out all the latest in art, design, style, fashion and trends. Keep up with her on www.courtneycachet.com or Facebook and join the conversation!
