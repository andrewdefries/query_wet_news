LONDON — One-of-a-kind designer Vivienne Westwood Sunday night presented a gorgeous collection of autumn and winter outfits at London Fashion Week, then went backstage and told reporters she hopes people stop buying her clothes.
"Stop all this consumerism," said Westwood, the former high priestess of punk who has increasingly used her catwalk shows to spotlight her concern about climate change.
"I just tell people, stop buying clothes. Why not protect this gift of life while we have it? I don't take the attitude that destruction is inevitable. Some of us would like to stop that and help people survive," she said.
Her show capped a gala day at London Fashion Week, with shows by Matthew Williamson, Jasper Conran and other top designers.
VIVIAN WESTWOOD
Long one of Britain's most celebrated designers, Westwood said she wants to try other challenges, including a television series on art and science after she shows her Gold Label collection in Paris next month.
She was in an enviable position: Her new collection had brought the house down, supermodel Kate Moss – in a black top, tight jeans and black leather cap – was waiting to congratulate her, and the audience of adoring fans included singer Janet Jackson and model Naomi Campbell.
The eclectic Red Label collection, which Westwood called romantic, began with models wearing tee shirts designed to call attention to the crisis in Haiti, in hopes of raising money for Campbell's effort to help mothers and babies displaced by the earthquake there.
Then it moved quickly into Westwood's special realm, a mixture of odd pairings that combined some traditional elements with looks that were new and different. One outfit mixed brightly colored plaid trousers with a polka dot blouse in orange and red – somehow, it worked.
There were mustard-colored tops and tuxedo-style jackets with pink details, Alice in Wonderland hats, and one model came out wearing an apron, sharpening a knife somewhat menacingly as she walked. Some of the most effective pieces were the simpler ones, including an elegant black cocktail dress that closed the show.
"The great thing about Vivienne is that you can wear her clothes if you're 16 or 60," said Jo Wood, a supermodel in an earlier era who recently returned to the catwalk to model for Westwood. "She's fantastic."
MATTHEW WILLIAMSON
Designer Matthew Williamson showed an exuberant display of slinky evening wear in vibrant colors.
With a variety of prints, fur, slim-cut leather pants and even low-rise harem pants, Williamson wowed a star-studded audience with his Autumn/Winter 2010 collection.
"Absolutely fantastic," said '60s supermodel Twiggy, whose stellar career has been marked by longevity. "I want about ten things. I want the harem pants in every color, they were amazing, and also those evening dresses, I probably couldn't wear them, but I think we'll be seeing a lot of those on the red carpet."
Twiggy said Williamson's clothes were extremely wearable.
"I love Matthew to death, I think he's a genius," she said. "They're for all age groups. The young look great in them. I'm certainly not young, and I love wearing them."
Actress Sienna Miller was also proud to pronounce herself a "FOM" – Friend of Matthew – and praised his outfits from her front row perch. So did model Yasmin Le Bon.
"He's taken the brand to a whole new level," said Miller, who is showing her Twenty8Twelve collection, designed with her sister Savannah Miller, later Sunday night.
The collection showed Williamson's easy approach, with gray and black checked wool overcoats set off by fur sleeves or collars in the same colors. Underneath the coats, models wore sexy off-the-shoulder dresses or dresses cut extremely low in the back.
JASPER CONRAN
Candy-colored silk crepe dresses for winter? Why not, asked designer Jasper Conran.
Conran kicked off his show with ballooning capes and dresses in thick wool and flannel worn over bodysuits.
His dramatic spherical coats and bodices were inspired by British sculptors Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, while details like space-age mirrored sequins and geometric cutouts were a modern take on the playful shapes and styles of the 60s.
Dark sheer tulle dresses were adorned with PVC panels, geometric sequins and huge polished silver cuffs.
Conran's black and grays contrasted with imposing cardinal red, a bold orange and peacock blue.
Even with softer styles, the designer focused on big, voluptuous silhouettes – like a nude textured organza dress with a billowing back resembling insect wings. "Peep show" A-line shift dresses had rectangular sheer panels cut out whimsically at the waist, thigh and arch of the back.
The show closed with a splash of color and light, fluid fabrics that contrasted with the severity of the earlier pieces. Summery silk crepe dresses appeared in eye-popping fuchsia, canary yellow and tangerine, just right to lift the winter mood.

The federal judge set to issue one of the first decisions on the Obama administration's health care law has financial ties to both the attorney general who is challenging the law and to a powerhouse conservative law firm whose clients include prominent Republican officials and critics of reform. This week, District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson is likely to render a procedural verdict on the Virginia Attorney General's lawsuit which contends that the federal health care overhaul is unconstitutional. The Bush appointee has been hearing oral arguments in his Richmond courtroom dating back to March. His verdict could serve as an important template for more than a dozen other states following Virginia's lead. But with power comes scrutiny. And as judgment day approaches, a Democratic source sends over judicial disclosure forms Hudson filed that could raise questions about his impartiality. From 2003 through 2008, Hudson has been receiving "dividends" from Campaign Solutions Inc., among other investments. In 2008, he reported income of between $5,000 and $15,000 from the firm. (Data from 2009 was not available at the Judicial Watch database.) A powerhouse Republican online communications firm, Campaign Solutions, has done work for a host of prominent Republican clients and health care reform critics, including the RNC and NRCC (both of which have called, to varying degrees, for health care reform's repeal). The president of the firm, Becki Donatelli, is the wife of longtime GOP hand Frank Donatelli, and is an adviser toformer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, among others. Another firm client is Ken Cuccinelli, the Attorney General of Virginia and the man who is bringing the lawsuit in front of Hudson's court. In 2010, records show, Cuccinelli spent nearly $9,000 for Campaign Solutions services. Campaign Solutions did not immediately return a request for information on the judge's relationship with the company.
The nexus between the chief lawyer and the judge spurs questions about judicial objectivity. At the very least, it shows how tightly connected the legal and political worlds can be and how difficult it is to remove the partisan threads from the heath care related lawsuits.
UPDATE: Campaign Solutions, Inc. sent over the following statement detailing Hudson's investment in the firm.
Judge Hudson has owned stock in Campaign Solutions going back 13 years to the founding of the company or well before he became a federal judge. Since joining the federal bench, he has fully disclosed his stock ownership in the company. He is a passive investor only, has no knowledge of the day to day operations of the firm, and has never discussed any aspect of the business with any official of the company.

-- Scores on the critical reading portion of the SAT college entrance exam fell three points to their lowest level on record last year, and combined reading and math scores reached their lowest point since 1995.
The College Board, which released the scores Wednesday, said the results reflect the record number of students from the high school class of 2011 who took the exam and the growing diversity of the test-taking pool – particularly Hispanics. As more students aim for college and take the exam, it tends to drag down average scores.
Still, while the three-point decline to 497 may look small in the context of an 800-point test, it was only the second time in the last two decades reading scores have fallen as much in a single year. And reading scores are now notably lower than scores as recently as 2005, when the average was 508.
Average math scores for the class of 2011 fell one point to 514 and scores on the critical reading section fell two points to 489.
Other recent tests of reading skills, such as the National Assessment of Education Progress, have shown reading skills of high-school students holding fairly steady. And the pool of students who take the SAT is tilted toward college-goers and not necessarily representative of all high school students.
But the relatively poor performance on the SATs could raise questions whether reading and writing instruction need even more emphasis to accommodate the country's changing demographics.
Roughly 27 percent of the 1.65 million test-takers last year had a first language other than English, up from 19 percent just a decade ago.
Jim Montoya, vice president of relationship development at the College Board, said the expanding Latino population was a factor, as well as greater outreach to get minority students to take the test. But there are others, too.
"It's a lot of little things," he said. For example, he said, the number of black students taking a solid core curriculum – a strong predictor of success on the test – has fallen from 69 percent to 66 percent over a decade.
The College Board, a membership organization that owns the exam and promotes college access, also released its first "College and Career Benchmark" report, which it said would eventually be used to help show states and school districts how well prepared their students are. Based on research at 100 colleges, it calculated that scoring 1550 or above on the three sections of the test indicated a 65-percent likelihood of attaining a B-minus or above average in the freshman year of college.
Overall, 43 percent of test-takers reached that benchmark.
The SAT and rival ACT exam are taken by roughly the same number of students each year. Most colleges require scores from at least one of the exams but will consider either. In recent years, some colleges have adopted test-optional policies allowing applicants to decline to submit test scores at all.

It's not exactly the boy who cried wolf - it might be more correct to call it the man who hollered woolly mammoth.
It appears that a story last week about a hairy, woolly mammoth seen walking across a Siberian river is a hoax.
In the opening frame of the blurry video that went viral, an animal is seen moving through the Kitoy River. Superimposed over the video are the words: Siberian Mammoth, Copyright Michael Cohen/Barcroft Media
That's where the controversy and accusations began to fly. WATCH THE VIDEO THAT STARTED IT ALL:
Paranormal writer Cohen has been criticized in the media for offering numerous videos he claimed were evidence of unexplained things like aliens, UFOs and now a woolly mammoth.
Based on Internet comments everywhere the story was posted, it doesn't look like many readers were surprised by the outcome. In fact, many were downright angry that Huffington Post and other legitimate media outlets gave any space to the story.
But one of those comments -- the most eye-opening one -- found its way over the weekend to the HuffPost story. Written by documentary filmmaker Lou Petho, it read:
"I'm the guy that filmed the river footage in the Sayan Mountains in the summer of 2011. ... I don't recall sighting a mammoth. ... I had no idea my footage was used to make this fake sighting, and question if a law was broken here."
After seeing the "mammoth" video revealed to the world last week, Petho was shocked, because he initially filmed the river for a special documentary he's working on about his grandfather's escape in 1915 from a Siberian POW camp. He surmised that Cohen may have taken his high definition footage and used it as a backdrop to create an elaborate hoax showing a woolly mammoth (or bear, as many readers insist) crossing the river.
"I checked it against my footage and knew it was mine when I looked at the placement of rocks in the foreground," Petho (seen above) told HuffPost, who he said was the first media organization to respond to his concerns.
"It was a mix of emotions," he added. "At first I was just pissed off that somebody would do this. It was obviously orchestrated and I assume money was made over it, so I was annoyed about that."
Woolly mammoths -- large, hairy prehistoric elephant-like relatives -- supposedly have been extinct for thousands of years. Yet, in 2010, Japanese scientists suggested it might be possible to bring one of the animals back to life using frozen mammoth DNA found preserved in a partial mammoth carcass in Siberia.
WATCH LOU PETHO'S ORIGINAL SIBERIAN RIVER VIDEO WITH NO MAMMOTH IN SIGHT:
When HuffPost contacted Barcroft Media, the co-copyright owners of the video, a spokesman was less than forthcoming.
"To be honest, it's not really anything that we want to comment on because we just license videos and images for other people, so we're going to sort it out with Lou and Michael and work out what's the right thing to do," he told HuffPost.
According to Petho, Barcroft Media was initially upset because it was under the impression that the river footage was Cohen's property. Barcroft has reportedly agreed to a financial arrangement with Petho (shown at right in a Skype interview with this reporter).
But what about the third player in all of this? When asked for comment, Cohen wrote in an e-mail to HuffPost, "I just looked at this footage and all it proves is that someone filmed the same spot at another time. While this new revelation does open up the prospect that this might well be a hoax at this stage, it is not conclusive and might simply be a case of the same spot being filmed twice.
"I was only given sketchy details regarding this footage," Cohen added. "And it is interesting to note that if, indeed, a mammoth was filmed, it occurred in the Irkutsk region -- an area of intense paranormal activity."
If there were any doubt about the difference of opinion regarding when the river footage was shot and by whom, take a look at this new video posted by Petho today:
Despite any compensation he may see, Petho is still upset that Cohen or anyone else could so easily put his own copyright name on a video. "If the general public wants to see a bunch of hoaxes made up, then let it be included in something like a hoax-of-the-week, and have fun with it.
"But to try and sell it off and make a profit out of it, that's not right."
Petho said he's met people who love to con the public and manipulate and get people to believe something that's not true. "I don't understand why, and it's just beyond my thinking. People should stand up to this kind of abuse on the Internet."
