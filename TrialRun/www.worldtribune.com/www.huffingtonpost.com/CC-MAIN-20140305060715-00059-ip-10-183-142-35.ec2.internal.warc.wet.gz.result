It was Mariah Carey's second marriage, but she waited till her wedding night anyway when she got married earlier this year she told the Mirror:
"It's not that we had NO intimacy, we just didn't have complete intimacy. It's just me, and my feelings.
"I definitely don't want to push it on anybody else. But we both have similar beliefs, and I just thought that it would be so much more special if we waited until after we were married. And it was, and it still is."
Mariah, 38, married Nick Cannon, 28, in April after a whirlwind 2-month courtship. She was previously married to Tommy Mottola. FOLLOW HUFFPOST ENTERTAINMENT

"The Politician", Andrew Young's incendiary new book about John Edwards, hits stores today, and Young was on "Good Morning America" this morning to talk about the scandals that the book exposes in intimate detail. Young reveals that Edwards had asked him to claim paternity of the child that Edwards had with mistress Rielle Hunter. Young on his decision to claim the baby:
Was is wrong for us to do it? Was it a huge mistake? Yes. But you also have to understand that we were given twelve hours to make this decision. We deeply loved John and Elizabeth Edwards. We deeply believed in his causes.
Young also discussed the sex tape that he allegedly uncovered, of Edwards and a woman Young thinks but is not certain is Hunter. Hunter is now suing to regain possession of the tape. Though Young would not say much about the video ("I'll let my lawyer handle that," he repeated), he claimed that he found it in a box of trash, not, as Hunter claims, in a box of her personal possessions. When asked why he refused to give Hunter the tape, all Young replied was that he wasn't certain that it was actually her in the video. He also defended his possession of the sex tape, claiming that, though he had been offered a "gigantic" sum of money to sell it, he had not.

WASHINGTON — Beginning to wind down a long and devastating war, President Barack Obama announced Wednesday night he was pulling home 33,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by next summer, withdrawing the "surge" of forces he had sent to rescue a flailing effort. Said Obama to a country eager for an exit: "The tide of war is receding."
A total of 10,000 troops will leave the war zone by the end of this year – fulfilling Obama's promise for a withdrawal starting next month – and more than 20,000 additional forces will leave by the summer of 2012, shortly before the president will go before voters in search of a second term.
Still, almost 70,000 U.S. troops will remain in an unstable country, fighting in a war bound to see more Americans killed. Obama said they will leave at a steady pace, but the U.S. combat mission is not expected to end until December 2014 – and even then, a sizable and enduring contingent may remain in a different role.
Obama's announcement from the White House came in a perilous political environment, with Americans soured on the war and the economy, many members of Congress pushing him to get troops home even faster, and his Republican presidential rivals taking shots at his leadership at every chance.
Plenty of disgruntled Democrats also took Obama to task, however politely, for not withdrawing more troops more quickly.
"I am glad this war is ending, but it's ending at far too slow a pace," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Added the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California: "We will continue to press for a better outcome."
At least 1,500 members of the U.S. military have died and 12,000 have been wounded since the war began in late 2001. The financial cost of the war has passed $440 billion and is on the rise, jumping to $120 billion a year. Those costs have risen in importance as a divided U.S. government struggles to contain its soaring debt.
Conceding the economic strain of waging war at a time of rising debt and fiscal constraint, Obama said it was time for America "to focus on nation building here at home." The president's chances for re-election rest largely on his ability to show faster job growth in a time of deepening economic pessimism.
The withdrawal is supported by the bold bottom-line claims of his security team: Afghanistan, training ground for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on America, is no longer a launching pad for exporting terrorism and hasn't been for years. But that could also fuel arguments for even greater withdrawals by voters wondering what the point of the war is after all these years, especially since the face of the enemy – al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden – was killed by American forces this spring during a raid in Pakistan.
Yet the White House insists the U.S. must maintain a strong fighting force in Afghanistan for now to keep the country from slipping back into a haven for al-Qaida terrorists.
The initial withdrawal is expected to happen in two phases, with 5,000 troops coming home this summer and an additional 5,000 by the end of the year.
Obama will visit troops Thursday at Fort Drum, the upstate New York Army post that is home to the 10th Mountain Division, one of the most frequently deployed divisions to Afghanistan.
He said materials recovered during the raid to get bin Laden showed that the al-Qaida terror network was under deep strain. He said bin Laden himself expressed concern that his organization would be unable to effectively replace senior leaders that had been killed.
The president declared, "We have put al-Qaida on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job is done."
Even after the troops come home, the war will remain expanded on Obama's watch. He approved 21,000 additional troops for Afghanistan shortly after taking office in 2009, bringing the total number to 68,000. That means he is likely to face re-election with more troops in Afghanistan than when he took office, although he has also dramatically reduced the U.S. footprint in Iraq.
The president spoke for just under 15 minutes from a silent East Room. It was a strategic moment for him to try to explain a turning point in the war effort without elevating it to a major Oval Office address – more of a stay-the-course case of progress and resilience.
"Of course, huge challenges remain," the president said. "This is the beginning – but not the end – of our effort to wind down this war. We will have to do the hard work of keeping the gains that we have made while we draw down our forces and transition responsibility for security to the Afghan government."
Significant questions still loom, including whether an Afghan government marred by corruption will be up to enormous job ahead.
Regardless, Obama made clear the United States was ready to move on from a decade defined by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, at a cost at of thousands of lives lost and more than $1 trillion spent. "We will not try to make Afghanistan a perfect place," Obama said flatly.
Potential GOP presidential candidates were quick to weigh in with criticism of Obama's plan – but they did not speak with one voice.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney accused Obama of proposing an "arbitrary timetable" and said the decision on withdrawing troops "should not be based on politics or economics." Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said the approach in Afghanistan should be focused on counterterrorism, "which requires significantly fewer boots on the ground than the president discussed tonight."
Back on Capitol Hill, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Obama of acting based on political considerations. "I am increasingly concerned by the lagging public support for the mission, and it was disappointing that the president failed to bring more clarity to the situation," he said.
Obama argued that reinforcements he sent have accomplished their mission: eroding the capacity of Taliban insurgents, diminishing the al-Qaida network and providing time and training for Afghanistan's forces to take charge.
Most Americans oppose the war in Afghanistan and are far more concerned about the teetering economic recovery at home.
Military commanders favored a plan that would allow them to keep as many of the 30,000 surge troops in Afghanistan for as long as possible, ideally through the end of 2012. That timeline would have given them greater troop strength through two crucial fighting seasons.
Obama overruled them.
Many Afghans are eager to see the Americans leave, yet there are big risks for the government there.
"There will be some battles, there will be suicide attacks and bomb attacks," acknowledged Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi. "But we in the Afghan forces are prepared to replace the foreign forces, and I'm confident the army has enough capacity and ability."
U.S officials have been saying for several years that al-Qaida's safe havens had shifted from Afghanistan to Pakistan. While there has been some success in degrading the terror network in Pakistan, there are still deep concerns among U.S. officials about Pakistan's commitment to fighting terrorism.
"So long as I am president," Obama said of Pakistan, "the United States will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to kill us. They cannot elude us."

Barack Obama has plenty of problems with the Republican Party. But his biggest problem is the least obvious of them: the Republicans are turning anti-war. Michael Brenner: Three Questions After Obama's Afghanistan Speech
Does the president's troop withdrawal from Afghanistan represent a qualitative change in official American thinking about its stakes in the region and in the wider 'war on terror'?	Jim Wallis: Aid, Not War in Afghanistan: An Open Letter to President Obama From Religious Leaders
We recognize that legitimate ethical and moral issues are at stake in Afghanistan, but we humbly believe there is a better way than war to address these important issues.	Ashwin Madia: Time For Troops To Come Home
War can't be strategized on compromise, trying to make everyone happy. Our decision to end our involvement must be firm. Right now, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, we're seeing none of that.	Asher Smith: Robert Gates: America's Best Defense Secretary?
By providing a model for effective Pentagon administration suitable for emulation, Gates has accomplished far more, under more challenging circumstances, than virtually all of his predecessors.	Chris Weigant: Predicting Obama's Afghanistan Announcement
Obama, from many accounts, will be using a tactic in his primetime speech that I would call "muddying the waters." The president is going to have a more complicated withdrawal schedule than one might have expected.	Edward Corcoran: Rally for Afghanistan
A Rally for Afghanistan program needs to get everyday Afghans enthused about the potential for growth of their own country. Real change will not come from the top down, but from the bottom up as individual Afghans work to build their own country. Around the Web:

Michael Haynes, 22, was fatally shot on Chicago's Far South Side Thursday evening.
A former high school CPS basketball star was fatally shot Thursday evening while intervening in an altercation involving his friend.
Michael Haynes, 22, was shot around 5:10 p.m. while attempting to break up a fight over a stolen necklace on the city's Far South Side, NBC Chicago reports.
Haynes, who was shot near his home in the 11600 block of South Wentworth Avenue, formerly played basketball at Washington High School and led his team to two consecutive appearances in the city championship game, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Haynes had committed to play Division I basketball at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y., according to ABC Chicago.
Four other people were fatally shot in Chicago Thursday evening into early Friday, including Baker Farhat, a man in his 30s, who was gunned down while working as a clerk at a gas station around 4:30 a.m. on the city's West Side, ABC reports.
Earlier in the evening, two men were fatally shot inside a car around 11:10 p.m. in the city's South Deering neighborhood. According to the Tribune, police say the shooting was likely gang-related.
Police have no suspects in custody in the shootings.
Gun violence in Chicago has attracted national media attention this year as the city's homicide rate has spiked 39 percent this year, as of the end of June. While commenting on the tragedy in Aurora, Colo., his week, President Barack Obama referenced the ongoing violence in Chicago, his hometown.
Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder this week announced that the Justice Department will be sending 50 federal law enforcement officers to help local police combat gang violence in Philadelphia, CBS Chicago reports. Some have questioned why Chicago has not received similar aid.
Earlier in the week, six people were wounded by gunfire over a period of 15 minutes, two of them fatally, Monday evening into early Tuesday in Chicago.
"Chicago seems like it's become a war zone," New Landmark Missionary Baptist Church Pastor Cy Fields said of the recent shootings as a coalition of 70 faith leaders from throughout the city and suburbs gathered to call for a weekend of peace this week.

Huffington Post readers may be surprised to learn that the world's deadliest conflict since World War II is still occurring -- in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is estimated that over the last 11 years this conflict has claimed more than five million lives. Secretary Clinton, who visited the region last year, has charged her team with doing whatever we can to help stop this conflict.
My office has been working hard on this effort. Yesterday, I spoke at the Center for Strategic and International Studies about the measures we are taking to end the trade in conflict minerals. Their trade helps fuel the conflict in eastern DRC, where sexual violence is employed as a weapon of war. My remarks can be found here.
As detailed in the State Department's 2009 Human Rights Report on the DRC armed groups and military units in some parts of the region have killed, raped, tortured, and abducted numerous civilians and burned and looted their villages in mineral rich areas, particularly near mines. They have also forced civilians, including children, to mine (or forced civilians to provide them with funding derived from the sale of) tin, tungsten, tantalum -- metals that are found in cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, and other popular electronics -- as well as gold. Profits from the illicit sale of these minerals are then used to continue the cycle of conflict, facilitating the purchase of small arms used to commit abuses, and reducing government revenues needed to improve security. My staff is working closely with many offices in the Department to coordinate a comprehensive response. Two weeks ago, we sent a team to the DRC to gather facts on the ground. The team met with representatives from the mining industry, NGOs, the Congolese government, and the UN Mission in the Congo. This followed the visit of several assistance assessment teams in December and January. The input from these visits and the reporting from our embassy, the United Nations, and others on the ground, has helped guide our discussions with different stakeholders on this issue.
Last week, I met with representatives from the electronics, automotive, jewelry, and manufacturing industries to learn of their efforts to ensure that their products are free from conflict minerals. Many of them are working hard to increase transparency in their supply chains. A media note from that meeting can be found here.
We are also meeting with the many local and international NGOs that have expertise in this area. Their guidance and cooperation will be helpful as we move towards a global framework for responsible extraction and trade of natural resources.
We have a lot more work to do. And in the weeks and months to come we will continue working with others throughout the U.S. government, the private sector, and the international community to tackle this issue. And we aim to raise it to the level of national leaders in countries throughout the region and in the industrialized world to give this the attention it deserves and find solutions to this urgent problem.
