When I was 8, my moms and I attended a pride march. We were marching with our rainbows and chanting, "We're here, we're queer, get used to it!" From across a waist-high barricade, the "Christians" responded, "You're here, you're queer, you won't be here next year!" So ominous.

Their resolution is gay bashing at its worse, because it implies that in the end God, too, is a gay basher who will sentence the unrepentant homosexual to an eternity in hell. Ultimately, the Southern Baptist resolution is an act of what I call "holy terrorism."
