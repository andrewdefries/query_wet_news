Slate:
In the real world, libertarians aren't cheering for high speed rail but rather trying to stop it from being built. They are succeeding. In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich campaigned against a high-speed rail line funded by the stimulus, got elected, and turned down the funding. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker did the same thing, only more so--his anti-train campaign even had its own Web site. In Florida, the state Supreme Court has just approved Gov. Rick Scott's decision to reject $2.4 billion of federal funds to build a Tampa-Orlando rail line; the state was being asked to contribute only $280 million to finish it off. The funding was originally agreed to by Charlie Crist, one of the Tea Party's archenemies, so Scott's victory could hardly be any sweeter...

Vermont Yankee Protest: 130 Demonstrators Arrested At Nuclear Plant's Corporate Headquarters

Green News
BRATTLEBORO, Vt. — A 93-year-old anti-nuclear activist was among more than 130 protesters arrested at the corporate headquarters of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant on the first day of the plant's operation after the expiration of its 40-year license.
Frances Crowe, of Northampton, Mass., said she wants Vermont Yankee to cease operations because she feels it's a threat to the people who live nearby.
"As I was walking down, all I could think of was Fukushima and the suffering of all the people, and I don't want that to happen to New England," Crowe said, referring to the Japanese nuclear reactor damaged last year after an earthquake and tsunami.
When asked how many times she'd been arrested, she answered: "Not enough."
A heavy police presence and ropes blocked off access to the offices in Brattleboro during Thursday's protest. The arrests were made calmly and without any confrontation, with obvious signs that protesters and police had worked out the logistics beforehand.
Brattleboro Police Chief Gene Wrinn said in a statement that more than 130 people had been arrested for unlawful trespass. He said after being processed, they were later released.
A company spokesman said work continued as normal at the plant 10 miles south in Vernon.
"We greatly appreciate the backing of our supporters and respect the rights of opponents to peacefully protest," said a statement issued by company spokesman Larry Smith. "Inside the gates, our employees will not be distracted. As it is every day, their focus on safety will be laser sharp."
A crowd estimated at more than 1,000 gathered in a downtown Brattleboro park before they marched the 3 1/2 miles to the headquarters. Some marched on stilts. Others with painted faces carried signs that read "hell no, we won't glow." Many chanted: "Shut it down."
Gov. Peter Shumlin was sympathetic to the protesters.
"I am very supportive of the peaceful protesters gathered today in Brattleboro to express their – and my – frustration that this aging plant remains open after its agreed-upon license has expired," he said.
In a coordinated action in New Orleans, the headquarters of Vermont Yankee's parent company, Entergy Nuclear, another group of seven activists were arrested after they went into the building and refused to leave, police said. The Journal News reported that five others also were arrested at Entergy offices in White Plains, N.Y.
Loyola University law professor Bill Quigley said the New Orleans protesters live near the Vermont plant and traveled to Louisiana to request a meeting with Entergy CEO J. Wayne Leonard. They didn't get that meeting before they were arrested.
"We're trying to tell Entergy that the whole world is watching, and you can't pollute in one area of the country without consequences for everybody," Quigley said.
The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued the plant a 20-year license extension, but the state of Vermont wants the plant to close and the two sides are fighting a legal battle. In January, a federal judge issued an order that allows the plant to continue operating while the legal case continues in court.
While the protesters gathered on the Brattleboro Commons, Vermont Yankee supporters sat across the street and watched. A half-dozen signs saying "VT4VY" were posted on the lawn.
"The thing is these people are not going to realize it until it's too late what a benefit it is down there. I feel bad for them. I don't think they're looking at the big picture," said Steve Shaclumis of Brattleboro.
Some protesters, including Crowe, were released immediately with citations to appear in court. Others were handcuffed and led onto a waiting school bus. It was expected they would be taken to a police station and then released.

Associated Press reporters Michael Kunzelman and Chevel Johnson in New Orleans and Jim Fitzgerald in White Plains, N.Y., contributed to report.

New York News
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, plans to become an adviser to Serbian nationalists who were once allied with the late Slobodan Milosevic if they win next month's election in Belgrade.
Giuliani said Friday that he and his consulting company will be advising Serbian Progressive Party officials on how to run the capital if they take power in the May 6 vote.
"I've seen cities turn around," Giuliani said at a joint press conference with top Serbian Progressive Party officials. "I am very excited at helping you do that."
The party is challenging the ruling pro-EU coalition at the polls, accusing the current government and the Belgrade city authorities of corruption and poor economic policies. The party were apparently hoping that Giuliani's visit will help boost their chances in the vote.
The visit, however, angered Belgrade's current mayor, Dragan Djilas, who blasted the former New York mayor for his support of NATO's 1999 bombing of Serbia and its capital. Djilas said Giuliani "is not the man to speak about the future of Belgrade."
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic also said "we do not need foreigners to tell us what's good for Serbia."
"They have their own elections and should conduct politics there," he said.
Giuliani said his company advises "on how to improve and help create economic development here in Belgrade the way I did in New York and the way I've done in a number of other cities."
Asked about the U.S.-led bombing in 1999 over Kosovo, Giuliani said this was "long time ago."
"America and Serbia should be good friends," he said.

On the heels of an informative Chicago Tribune editorial board gubernational debate among all five candidates, in an otherwise uninspiring race, the League of Women Voters and the Illinois Broadcasters Associations are pressing ahead with a strangely partisan decision to limit the discussion of an ABC-TV televised debate to only two candidates--Gov. Pat Quinn and State Sen. Bill Brady.
Sure enough, Republican Sen. Brady, received 155,527 votes in his party's primary.
And yet, Green Party gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney won twice that number -- over 361,000 votes in 2006 -- establishing the Greens as the state's official third party. The Illinois League's partisanship is a stark reversal from its national organization's much ballyhooed departure from the presidential debates 20-odd years ago, when the League accused the Democrats and Republicans of "perpetrating a fraud" by limiting such debates. Back in 1988, the League pulled no punches: "It has become clear to us that the candidates' organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions," Neuman said. "The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public."
Is the League--and the IBA--perpetrating such a "fraud" now? Is the League being fair and serving the public interest?
Echoing that sentiment today, the Peoria Journal Star recently noted the painfully lackluster race between the Democrats and Republicans, and questioned why an established and proven candidate like Whitney shouldn't be allowed to join the debate? The Journal Star concluded: "Every voice matters."
In fact, with the state facing a record budget crisis, and neither Democratic or Republican candidate able to propose an adequate solution, Illinois Issues columnist Charles Wheeler noted Whitney's unique role in the race:
In fact, only one candidate for governor has a comprehensive plan to solve the state's budget crisis, one in which the numbers actually work: the Green Party's Rich Whitney. The Carbondale attorney issued a 21-page platform on the state's tax structure and economic development, laying out in considerable detail his ideas for fixing the structural budget deficit and building a full employment economy.
Last month, the Chicago Tribune editorial board invited all five gubernatorial candidates to their chambers for a special interview and debate. Whitney's responses to the Trib's questionnaire dealt with the budget crisis, health care, job creation and education. The video of the candidates' debate is here:
Meanwhile, as Whitney and his statewide supporters call on the League and the IBA to open the debate, his campaign released this statement to Illinois voters: This Blogger's Books from
