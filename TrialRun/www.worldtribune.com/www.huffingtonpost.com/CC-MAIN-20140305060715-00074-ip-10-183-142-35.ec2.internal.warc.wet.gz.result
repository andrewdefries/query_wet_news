Comics Alliance :	We are not the mainstream.
That's a truth understood by anyone who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered or in any other way queer. We are not the audience. We are not the market. We are not the people.
It's also a truth understood by a lot of people with a passion for comics. We know our love for this medium has traditionally marked us as niche. We are kids with a solitary hobby. We are adults who read picture books. We are customers of stores that other people have never been to. So perhaps it's not surprising that a lot of LGBT people are proud nerds, and a lot of comic nerds are proudly queer. We already know we're fringe. Why not embrace it?

UPDATE 8/30/12, 7:45 a.m.: United Airlines blamed a piece of hardware for Tuesday's network outage that grounded flights across the country, reports the Associated Press. "The problem was a piece of hardware in a data center that failed to communicate properly with other computer equipment," said Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United Continental Holdings Inc. "A backup system failed to take over for the troubled hardware."
-------
UPDATE 8/28/12, 6:05 p.m.: The network outage that grounded United Airlines flights and disrupted its computer system was fixed by Tuesday evening, the Associated Press reports. The company's website has come back online and flights started running again at about 4:30 p.m. Central Time. However, United is still working on getting them going on time, and long lines are still being reported at some airports. At least 200 flights were affected.
-------
PREVIOUSLY 8/28/12, 4:54 p.m.: United Airlines experienced a network outage Tuesday, grounding flights across the country and angering travelers. @united

We have a network outage & are working to get systems back online. We'll update soon.

According to Yahoo! Finance, one of their editors, Aaron Task, is a New York's JFK Airport and reports that ticketing, baggage and online check-ins are affected.
United's website is also currently down. Mary Ryan, a United spokeswoman, told The Denver Post: "A network outage is affecting our airports and United.com functions. We are working to resolve the issue and minimize any impact to our operations."
Check out traveler's rants about it below.
A similar incident occurred in June 2011, leading to widespread cancellations and delays. More to come...

"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" has always cultivated a solid gay fanbase in both its television and print incarnations. Now the "Buffy" comics series, which picked up where the popular series left off, is introducing its first gay male slayer.
Out magazine reports that the new character, Billy, will be introduced in Season 9. Drew Greenberg, who collaborated with "Buffy" writer and producer Jane Espenson on the project, tells Out that Billy "is someone who sees a need in his hometown and steps up to fill the void, even at great personal risk." For "Buffy" fans who know that only women can be "called" (i.e. chosen by fate) to become slayers, Greenberg adds: "He may not have the actual powers of the Slayers, but he's determined to be his own kind of hero, one who's sort of modeled after those who do have the power, and he sets out to make due with what he has. In the process, I think he hopes to follow the lead of all the strong, powerful Slayers who came before him and live up to the standard they set."
The introduction of Billy comes at a time when lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) characters have been popping up in a number of popular comics. In April, newspaper comic strip "Funky Winkerbean" announced plans to mark its 40th anniversary by featuring a story arc about a gay couple planning to attend their high school prom together, and the consequences that ensue.
A month later, DC Comics co-publisher Dan DiDio told attendees at the Kapow Comic Convention in London that an unnamed superhero -- an established player in one of the series, and was originally introduced as straight -- will become "one of our most prominent gay characters," while Marvel Comics' openly gay hero Northstar tied the knot with his longtime boyfriend Kyle Jinadu in a June issue. Meanwhile, Kevin Keller, Archie Comics' first openly gay character who is also an active military officer, tied the knot with his African-American partner in a January issue. Still, "Buffy" creator Joss Whedon had long expressed a desire to introduce a gay male character. And as Greenberg told Out, he wasn't overly concerned with Billy's storyline somehow rivaling against those of other gay comic characters, saying the character will also "examine traditional gender roles" in addition to being a positive representation of a gay man. "So much crap gets heaped upon us as gay men -- crap from straight people and, frankly, crap from other gay people -- about how it's important to be masculine in this world, how your value is determined by your ability to fit into masculine norms prescribed by heterosexual society and, sadly, co-opted by gay society as a way to further disenfranchise and bully those who don't meet those norms," Greenberg is quoted by the magazine as saying. "And those attitudes are a reflection of not just our own internalized homophobia, but of our misogyny, too, and that's something I've never understood." Also on HuffPost:	Loading Slideshow
ShatterstarHm, another gay mutant who's inspired by astronomy? Alright. When he's not slicing baddies down, he's cuddling up with X-Factor teammate and boyfriend, Rictor.BatwomanMuch to the dismay of DC Comics' testosterone-driven heroes, Batwoman proudly plays for the other team. A victim of "don't ask, don't tell," this marine-turned-vigilante's sexuality is just one layer of her increasingly rich narrative. Batwoman's mature approach to gay super heroics resulted in her very own solo series.Midnighter and ApolloThe happily married members of Stormwatch -- a secretive, peacekeeping organization that's protected the world for centuries -- have saved the world more times than Superman and Batman combined. Now there's a power couple. Rawhide KidThis cowboy knows sure can wrangle up controversy. After spending more than half a century as a straight guy, the western hero was infamously reimaged by as a stereotypically prissy gay man by Marvel Comics.XavinSwitching between male and female form at a moment's notice, playing with gender is no sweat for the shape-shifting alien. "Changing our gender is no different than changing our hair color." Amen to that.Kevin KellerAs Archie Comics' one and only gay character, army brat Kevin Keller helped thrust Riverdale in the 21st century. Kevin actually beat Northstar to the altar earlier this year, when he got married in <em>Life with Archie #16</em>.
DakenThere's no one Daken loves more than himself. But that doesn't stop Wolverine's son from seducing any man or woman if it helps him get what he wants. "He's bisexual," said former <em>Daken: Dark Wolverine</em> scribe Marjorie Liu, in a interview with Newsarama.com. "And he uses sex as a tool, as a weapon."KarolinaAfter absorbing enough solar energy, this lesbian super-teen transforms into a living rainbow. 'Nuff said. BunkerThough we don't know much about him, Bunker is the latest addition to DC Comic's small pantheon of gay heroes. Said costume designer Brett Booth on his blog last year, "I wanted you to know he might be gay as soon as you see him. Our [Teen Titans] is partly about diversity of ANY kind."VoodooPart human. Part alien. Part clone? When the bisexual heroine isn't busy figuring out her true identity, she's off hunting parasitic aliens. But that doesn't seem half as fun as her other job -- as an exotic dancer.Hulkling And WiccanDiversity reaches all corners of the Marvel universe, including their teenaged Young Avengers. Young, in-love, and capable of kicking Dr. Doom's teeth in, this rock solid relationship is an inspiration for young and old readers alike.StarmanOK, seriously? Another star-based superhero? The rouge alien-turned Justice League MVP defies the DC Universe's glass ceiling, showing a limitless potential for all gay crime fighters. Plus, he hangs out with a talking gorilla -- that must count for something.The QuestionBatwoman's former lover forgoes the super heroics for scrappy, Dick Tracy-in-drag street justice. One of Batman's most trusted allies, she has the social stock most straight characters would kill for.

YouTuberSeaNanners brings his famous gaming commentary live to the What's Trending studio while answering fan questions and guiding me through Resident Evil 6 -- which is officially released!
Voice actor Matt Mercer, who makes his Resident Evil debut as recurring character Leon Kennedy, pops on the scene as a surprise guest and helpful hand to guide SeaNanners through the perilous maze of zombie foes.
According to SeaNanners (real name Adam Montoya), Resident Evil 5 was more action-orientated whereas the sixth installment "looks like it's going back to creepy," citing the dark and ominous motif of the game.
As a master of gameplay commentary, SeaNanners advises those following suit to just have fun. "It helps to be comfortable in your own skin... whatever your voice may be, just focus on that!" While commentary used to be about giving tips, now personalities are really emerging as YouTubers find their own audiences and styles of play.
While Matt's a veteran gamer and no stranger to the Resident Evil universe (and even sports the hair of his character!), he assures us that none of those traits are requirements for being an RE6 voice actor. Luckily for the new Leon, he was able to provide a voice in a world that he was really passionate about.
Matt suggests new RE6 players to play online because other people can jump in with your partner and take over, not to mention you'll gain the ability to jump in other people's games as a zombie and hunt them down!
