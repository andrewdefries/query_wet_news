'Ex-Gay' Group Activist To Gay Man: Your Homosexuality Caused Your Son's Death (VIDEO)

Jerry, a man married for more than two decades and a father of two, spent years fighting his attraction to other men. He listened to tapes from "ex-gay" group Exodus International and joined an "ex-gay" fellowship in his hometown, hoping the efforts would eliminate his homosexual urges -- but they didn't.
Seven years ago, Jerry came out as a gay man. Though he was free from the struggle of fighting his homosexuality, Jerry's life was marred by tragedy just a few months later when his 26-year-old epileptic son, Billy, passed away from a seizure. "It was devastating for all of us," Jerry says in this video from Lisa Ling's special report on "God & Gays."
When Jerry returned to town for his son's funeral, he was confronted by someone from the "ex-gay" group regarding the cause of Billy's death. "One of the people from Exodus had said to me, 'It was your fault,'" Jerry tells Ling in the video. "He said, 'Well, the Lord took his hand of protection off of your family because you chose the homosexual lifestyle.'"
"Given that state of vulnerability that you were in, did part of you believe that?" Ling asks.
"I hate to admit it, but I think when you're raised with the message that you're wrong and that you're evil, some of that haunts you and stays with you, in a way," Jerry replies. "You almost feel like you deserve bad things because you couldn't fix it, because you couldn't overcome it, because you couldn't conquer it. It really goes in deep into the heart and really does damage."
In Ling's special report, Jerry and several "reparative therapy" survivors confront the leader of the "ex-gay" organization Exodus International, Alan Chambers, with more stories of their painful experiences in the "ex-gay" movement. Chambers will face his critics and then speak out with a new message of his own: an apology.
UPDATE: Exodus International has announced it will shut down after 37 years of ministry.
"Our America with Lisa Ling -- Special Report: God & Gays" airs Thursday, June 20, at 10 p.m. ET on OWN.

Bachmann's Alleged Involvement In July,gay advocacy group Truth Wins Out released video footage allegedly shot undercover at the Christian-affiliated Minnesota clinic owned by Michele Bachmann and her husband, and claimed to find evidence of conversion therapy being performed on the premises. "Michele Bachmann wants to be in the Oval Office and wants to be the president of the United States," Wayne Besen, "It's important to know what her true beliefs are and what goes on in this clinic." 'Gay Barbarian Horde' Invades Bachmann's ClinicLast July activists dressed as "gay barbarians" traveled to Bachmann's clinic to protest its alleged "pray the gay away" practices.
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/21/michele-bachmanns-glitter-prank_n_906165.html" target="_hplink">A press release issued by the group reads:</a>
<blockquote>Today a horde of gay barbarians descended upon Michele and Marcus Bachmann's "pray away the gay" clinic and demanded that Marcus come out and discipline them for their "deviant" behavior.
Marcus Bachmann, who conducts "reparative therapy" at the clinic intended to convert homosexuals, has said that gays are "barbarians who need to be disciplined." The horde requested to speak directly with Bachmann and experience some "discipline" for themselves.
When Marcus was no where to be found, the barbarians glittered the empty waiting room and reception area while chanting, "You can't pray away the gay -- baby, I was born this way!"
The action was organized by the same young man who threw glitter on Newt Gingrich, starting a national trend in political protest of anti-LGBT sentiments from political candidates and campaigns.
"Michele and Marcus Bachmann think gay people are barbarians?" asked LGBT activist Nick Espinosa. "I think its clear to everyone who the real barbarians are, based on the Bachmanns' archaic views on LGBT equality."</blockquote>Gay Conversion Therapy Victim Comes ForwardEarlier this month, "I'm From Driftwood" featured a video interview with Samuel Brinton, who was raised in rural Iowa and subjected to forced Christian conversion therapy. "We then went into the 'Month of Hell,'" Brinton explained. "The 'Month of Hell' consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures of explicit acts between men would be shown and I'd be electrocuted."Prominent 'Ex-Gay' Doctor Retracts Claims Made In Key Gay Conversion Therapy StudyThis week the psychiatrist who published a controversial 2001 study proclaiming that "highly motivated" gay and lesbian people could change their sexual orientation <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/robert-spitzer-ex-gay-psychiatrist-retraction_n_1417679.html?ref=gay-voices" target="_hplink">retracted his initial claims.</a>
Psychiatrist Bob Spitzer, who had ironically led the effort to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in 1973, told American Prospect that he now wants to retract his study, while addressing several of the ample criticisms against its findings.
"In retrospect, I have to admit I think the critiques are largely correct," said the 80-year-old Spitzer, who is now retired and suffering from Parkinson's disease. "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more."John Smid Discusses 'Praying The Gay Away' With Chris Matthews The former director of the ex-gay Christian ministry Love in Action <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/john-smid-former-ex-gay-minister-sexual-orientation-_n_1022417.html#s423190&title=Gay_Conversion_Therapy" target="_hplink">came forward last October</a> to say that not only that he is gay, but that he believes it is impossible to change one's sexual orientation.
Though Smid admitted he did "experience homosexuality" on the show, he arguably stopped short of embracing his sexual orientation. "I would say predominately, I am attracted to men," he said. "At the same time, I've chosen to be married [to a woman] and a lot of people make that choice." Not Born This Way? Richard Cohen, director of the International Healing Foundation and author of "Coming Out Straight" and "Gay Children, Straight Parents," believes that people can change. "There is no credible scientific evidence to suggest either a genetic or biologic basis for homosexual desires in men or women," he said. "So people are not born this way...it's always a confounding of many different factors that lead people to experience these desires...people don't choose this, the choice is: do they want to lead that life, or do they want to change?" Gay To Straight With Prayer? In an appearance on "Dr. Drew" earlier this year, psychologist Joseph Nicolosi -- a founding member of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) -- said he continues to support conversion therapy: "People can change, people have a choice, people should be given a choice," he said. "If a person chooses to exercise his heterosexual potential...we provide that therapy...it doesn't work for all people, but it works for some."

Saturday Night Live has always put its finger on what makes politicians funny. The show's performers do more than mere impressions of the candidates -- they identify and then expose what makes the politicians unique and quirky. Nobody is spared, Democrat or Republican. Last week at a panel as part of the New York Comedy Festival, Seth Meyers and several other of the show's writers discussed this season's GOP debate sketches, particularly how cast members have embraced their roles as the lesser-known candidates. Meyers singled out Andy Samberg for how he's played Rick Santorum as someone who's just nervous to be there.
For good reason, the writers tend to emphasize the leading candidates in their sketches, with Mitt Romney, Gov. Rick Perry, and Herman Cain taking centerstage lately. Even Rep. Michele Bachmann, who was at one time looking to become a fan-favorite on the show, has been overshadowed by those who have emerged as the new charged candidates. Polling numbers have almost a direct relationship to the amount of face time the candidates' impersonators will get on the weekend's program. Newt Gingrich, who's been surging in the polls of late, was conspicuously absent from last night's show.
Instead, the show opened with a Romney sketch, and only returned to politics during "Weekend Update" when Gov. Jon Huntsman made a real appearance at the desk to talk about his love for New Hampshire, a key election state:
Many bloggers enjoyed Huntsman's light-hearted banter with Meyers, poking fun at himself. If he wants to be the "most appealing GOP presidential candidate to liberals, he's already won," declared The Huffington Post's editors. "[N]ow he's made a self-aware SNL appearance where he proved he had a genuine sense of humor to boot." Mediaite's Sarah Devlin agreed: "Huntsman was a great sport and his delivery was quite good." She only wished it had been longer. And "It became clear as the bit went on," said Ned Colby and Dale W. Eisinger at NBCDFW.com, "it was more impassioned plea than simple gag for the trailing candidate."
It's no secret that Huntsman has been largely passed over during past GOP debates in favor of others. He's had a difficult time establishing himself from the mix; last night, he took a bold step forward to introduce himself to American voters. Huntsman didn't spend any of that time outlining his stances on issues, sharing his background, or hitting his talking points. Instead, he helped Meyers and co. do their jobs. He assisted them in establishing what was funny about him. Don't be surprised to see more of this version of the Huntsman character in future episodes, with Killam incorporating some of these notes into his depiction of the governor. That could keep the conversation about him going much longer than just the day after his surprise appearance on the late-night show.
One SNL appearance is not enough alone to help Huntsman's numbers. But it does have the ability to get people talking. After all, CNN, Politico, CBS News, the Los Angeles Times, and many others wrote about the sketch today. As some GOP candidates are fading, an opportunity is opening up for Huntsman. Romney will continue to lead things off and to dominate the conversation at debates and during sketches afterward. But with so many months left before the primary, and with the race still so wide open, Huntsman is poised to make a move.

Anthony D. Romero: Substance, Not Soundbites, Needed at GOP National Security Debate
During last week's debate, four of the GOP candidates promoted "enhanced interrogation tactics," including waterboarding, as necessary for national security. Plain and simple, waterboarding is torture. As such, it is illegal under U.S. and international law. Matthew Dowd: Open Up the Debates
Here's a serious concern for this election cycle: the media's systematic exclusion from the debates of candidates who may actually have become competitive in this very fluid environment if given a nationally televised forum to reach to voters.	Mary Kaye Huntsman: What You Don't Know About Governor Huntsman
From the day we were married Jon said that whatever we did in life, he wanted to make sure it was always about giving back. Our family motto has been, "No exercise is greater for the human heart, than leaning down and lifting another up."	Michael J.W. Stickings: Things Aren't Going Well For Mitt Romney
Mitt Romney's rivals know that attacking him will only weaken him for the general election, assuming he wins the nomination. But at least a couple of his rivals are actually trying to win the nomination. Joe Peyronnin: GOP = Oops
The GOP primary process has been painful and embarrassing, especially for Republicans. While President Barack Obama faces a tough reelection campaign, the Republican Party seems to be doing all it can to help him win a second term. Or, as Governor Perry would say, "Oops."	Around the Web:
