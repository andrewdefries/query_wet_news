A few months ago, GE Healthcare rolled out a portable electrocardiogram machine, trumpeting the new product's ability to help patients wherever they might need it.
But the most interesting thing about the MAC 800 is not where it can go, but where it came from: China.
Chinese engineers funded by GE Healthcare helped develop the machine for sale in China. Although initially tailored to local needs, the MAC 800 has found a new market - the United States, where hospitals with community programs can easily take it on the road to treat patients.
The company is betting that other products originally created for the developing world ultimately also can be useful here. GE is tapping into the increasingly popular idea that medical innovation should be a global two-way street in which the West benefits from the resourcefulness and frugality poorer nations apply to health problems. The idea isn't new, but it's gaining traction, beyond the creation of products and technology, as public health experts rethink ways to prevent disease and deliver care.
Health care in the developing world holds several "general lessons for richer countries," Nigel Crisp, a former permanent secretary of Britain's Department of Health, observed in a recent Times of London op-ed. "Unconstrained by our history, [developing countries] train people differently, create new sorts of organisations, involve families and communities and concentrate more on promoting health rather than on just tackling disease."
With interest in international health expanding, this type of thinking is likely to become more common. A 2009 survey by the Consortium of Universities for Global Health found that enrollment in global health courses had doubled since 2006. This rapid growth is changing the way people think about health care abroad, says Dr. Michael Merson, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. "I think the old days of development ... where the rich helped the poor, for the most part have passed," he says. "I think we go into this with a true sense of shared partnership."
The Roots Of 'Kangaroo Care' While some experts doubt the U.S. is really ready to embrace lessons from abroad, there is a growing number of examples. They run the gamut from basic to high-tech - including an electronic medical records program in use in more than 20 countries.
The Boston-based Prevention and Access to Care and Treatment project, which serves HIV/AIDS patients, is modeled on a community health worker program pioneered in Haiti. Since the late 1990s, the project has sought out the most difficult-to-treat HIV patients: those who fail in conventional programs because of factors such as mental illness and poverty. The program reports good results and has been sharing its methods with the New York City health department and hospitals with similar programs.
"Kangaroo care," an approach developed in Colombia, is another example. With a major shortage of incubators, doctors advised mothers to cradle preterm babies in a sling. They did so well that it changed what had been the conventional approach in the U.S., which encouraged only limited human contact while newborns were in incubators.
Merson participated in what became one of the best known illustrations of a borrowed idea. During the 1970s he was in Bangladesh working with other doctors to treat an outbreak of cholera, an acute infectious disease whose symptoms include severe diarrhea. The team made extensive use of a cheaper, simpler treatment for diarrhea, which can result in life-threatening dehydration, and it is now the recommended standard for care worldwide.
"It took a while for pediatricians to use here," Merson says, "but now we have products like Pedialyte and other kinds of oral rehydration fluids that are used to treat kids."
These days, it's increasingly common to find experts without medical backgrounds collaborating on health-related projects for developing countries. One example is OpenMRS, an open-source electronic medical record system that started in 2004 as a collaboration between the Boston-based nonprofit Partners in Health and the Regenstrief Institute, an informatics and health care research organization in Indianapolis. Both programs use the system to manage projects in the developing world. It's especially critical for hospitals that track large numbers of HIV-positive patients, says William Tierney, an informatics expert at Regenstrief.
Without electronic information, "How do you know when patients aren't coming in, so you can go out and chase them down to enhance adherence to the drug?" Tierney asks.
Rwanda, Tanzania and Peru are among the countries where the program has caught on. Since the software platform is open source it can be customized by anyone and tailored to specific programs, which would be more challenging with bigger commercial systems. Now it is being used at Indiana University's School of Medicine - where Tierney is a professor - as well as at sites in Maryland, Boston and Los Angeles.
'What Can The U.S. Learn From Ghana?'
Students now in school might lead a new wave of innovation. Anjali Sastry, a global health delivery and system dynamics researcher who lectures at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says her MBA students are increasingly using what they learn to experiment with different models for care delivery. "Ghana tried a national health insurance system, for instance," she says. "What can the U.S. learn from Ghana?"
Dr. Jaspal Sandhu, a global health designer and researcher with an engineering background, is among those asking such questions. In 2004, Sandhu and two other researchers traveled to Tamil Nadu state in India to closely examine the workings of Aurolad, an affiliate of Aravind Eye Care System, which developed an intraocular lens that significantly reduced the cost of cataract surgery in India. Today, Aurolab exports the lenses to 120 countries, including Canada, Denmark and Israel, though not the U.S.
It's not just the lenses that interest Sandhu, a consultant who has worked with the World Bank, Microsoft and other clients. It's the way the Aravind system works. This includes the use of health workers rather than doctors for certain basic procedures--one of a handful of strategies that could promote "lower costs and shorter waiting periods," he says.
Not every expert is as optimistic. Josh Ruxin, an assistant professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, says in the U.S., "hyper-technologization of everything" leads to rejection of simple solutions in favor of "the stuff that has some incredibly overly technical basis."
"I think there are a ton of lessons that can be applied in primary care and at community health centers from countries like Rwanda," says Ruxin, who runs a health and poverty program in that country. "But I haven't sensed that the United States is ready for that."
GE Healthcare, a believer, is investing $3 billion over six years in its "Healthymagination" initiative to create low-cost, high-quality products worldwide. It aims to use "reverse innovation," the same development process that produced the MAC 800. GE learned a hard lesson prior to the initiative. "Quite frankly, when we develop stuff in the U.S. and try to make it available for lower-cost markets, it just doesn't work," says Melanie Varin, GE's general manager of marketing for diagnostic cardiology. Products created that way tend to be too expensive for those markets and are unable to capture "the mindset of the local user."
That experience led GE to pursue its current approach, which is outlined in an October 2009 Harvard Business Review article, coauthored by GE's CEO, Jeffrey R. Immelt. "Once products have proven themselves in emerging markets," the article says, "they must be taken global."

PENSACOLA, Fla. — Crucial pieces of a lawsuit challenging the Obama administration's health care overhaul can go to trial, with a judge ruling Thursday he wants to hear more arguments over whether it's constitutional to force citizens to buy health insurance.
In a written ruling, U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson said it also needs to be decided whether it's constitutional to penalize people who do not buy insurance with taxes and to require states to expand their Medicaid programs. Another federal judge in Michigan threw out a similar lawsuit last week.
Vinson set a hearing for Dec. 16. The lawsuits will likely wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
In his 65-page ruling, Vinson largely agreed with the 20 states and the National Federation of Independent Business, saying Congress was intentionally unclear when it created penalties in the legislation. The states have argued that Congress is overstepping its constitutional authority by penalizing people for not doing something – not buying health insurance.
The penalties for those who do not buy insurance are never referred to as taxes in the 2,700-page act, Vinson wrote. Attorneys for the Obama administration argued at a September hearing that the penalties should be considered a tax levied by Congress – as allowed by its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.
"One could reasonably infer that Congress proceeded as it did specifically because it did not want the penalty to be 'scrutinized' as a $4 billion annual tax increase," Vinson wrote.
"It seems likely that the members of congress merely called it a penalty and did not describe it as revenue-generating to try and insulate themselves from the potential electoral ramifications of their votes."
The administration's attorneys had told Vinson last month that without the regulatory power to ensure young and healthy people buy health insurance, the health care plan will not survive.
Vinson also took issue with the administration's argument that the states and individual taxpayers must wait until 2014, when some of the changes take effect, to file any lawsuits. Vinson said businesses and states are feeling the ramifications of the law now.
The health care act leaves states with the difficult choice of expanding their Medicaid programs and taking on major expenses or entirely withdrawing from the insurance program for the poor, Vinson wrote. In states like Florida – where 26 percent of the state budget is devoted to Medicaid, according to the lawsuit – the law amounts to coercion, Vinson wrote.
Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum praised the ruling.
"It is the first step to having the individual mandate declared unconstitutional and upholding state sovereignty in our federal system," McCollum said in a statement.
He filed the lawsuit just minutes after President Barack Obama signed the 10-year, $938 billion health care bill into law in March.
Stephanie Cutter, a political operative tapped by Obama to guide efforts to explain the law's benefits, wrote in a White House blog late Thursday that the government expected to prevail.
Cutter highlighted a favorable ruling by a Michigan federal judge and described Vinson's ruling as procedural.
"Having failed in the legislative arena, opponents of reform are now turning to the courts in an attempt to overturn the work of the democratically elected branches of government. This is nothing new. We saw this with the Social Security Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Right Act – constitutional challenges were brought to all three of these monumental pieces of legislation, and all those challenges failed," Cutter wrote.
Vinson's ruling comes a week after District Judge George Caram Steeh in Detroit ruled that the mandate to get insurance by 2014 and the financial penalty for skipping coverage are legal. He said Congress was trying to lower the overall cost of insurance by requiring participation.
There is also a lawsuit pending in Virginia. A federal judge there has allowed the lawsuit to continue, ruling the overhaul raises complex constitutional issues.
The other states involved in the lawsuit Vinson is hearing are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington.

After Whole Foods found out that Bethenny Frankel's Skinnygirl cocktail natural ingredients were not so natural, the powerhouse chain pulled the product from its shelves.
“There are no ingredients listed on the bottle,” one nutritionist tells me. “Bethenny has been promoting the drink on and off-camera for years [as] full of 'natural flavors, lightly sweetened with agave nectar and made with premium Blue Agave clear tequila,' but that’s about all we know about its ingredients."
The reality star, who has told many friends "you have to fake it until you make it," has been doing just that.
“Whole Foods isn’t about faking anything,” a store worker, who did not have permission to speak on behalf of the company, told me. “The store prides itself in selling the best quality whole products that our high-end consumers expect. Not novelty products that are shaded with secrecy.”
What’s amazing is how quiet this big blow to Frankel’s brand has remained. Neither The Skinnygirl website nor the Whole Foods site mentions the withdrawal. And no response was given from either the company or Frankel’s spokesperson.

The Federal Reserve gave just five banks the chance to bid on taxpayer-owned AIG assets -- again.
It's just the latest secret sale of the toxic mortgage-backed securities, which the Fed has been trying to unload ever since it absorbed them at the height of the 2008 financial crisis to prevent AIG's collapse. Previous closed auctions - in which only a few banks were allowed to participate - were heavily criticized because they shut out smaller dealers. On Tuesday, the Fed invited just some of Wall Street's biggest firms - Credit Suisse, Barclays, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and RBS Securities - to participate in the auction of $6 billion worth of so-called Maiden Lane II securities, which was won by Credit Suisse for an undisclosed amount. It's the third such closed auction out of 25 auctions. After the Fed sold $6.2 billion in Maiden Lane II securities sold to Goldman Sachs in early February, David Castillo, head of sales and trading at Further Lane Securities, told Bloomberg News, "The exclusivity by which the process has shut out smaller dealers is a little un-American.... It seems odd that if you want to get the best possible price that it wouldn't be open to anyone who wants to put in the most competitive bid."
And the Fed sold $7.01 billion in Maiden Lane II securities to Credit Suisse in a similarly closed auction in January.
The Fed will be repaid in full for its $19.5 billion loan to the Maiden Lane II portfolio as a result of its sale of the securities. The sale also will produce $2.8 billion for taxpayers, according to the Fed's announcement. The New York Fed declined to comment on the auction.
"The New York Fed decided to move forward with the transaction only after determining that the winning bid represented good value for the public," the Fed wrote in its announcement. When the Fed sold the AIG securities in open auctions in 2011, some investors complained that the sales disturbed market prices, according to The Wall Street Journal.

HuffPost Live 321 News
Tom Sizemore says the explosive recording in which he alleges a year-long affair between President Bill Clinton and Elizabeth Hurley is "the rantings of a guy that...had a very severe drug problem."During an exclusive interview with HuffPost Live's Ricky Camilleri on the day the tape was published by Radar Online, Sizemore admitted that it was his voice but said everything in the recording is completely false. Sizemore said the tape was recorded four to five years ago when he was struggling with addiction and "wasn't with very nice people.""It's not true. I was never at the White House. I've never met Bill Clinton," Sizemore told HuffPost Live. "I'm not denying that I said these things. I don't remember saying them, but it's an old video tape and they're the rantings of a guy...that had a very severe drug problem. Although I said it, none of it is true."Sizemore said he has not spoken with Hurley, with whom he had a previous romantic relationship, but he regrets the trouble he has caused her."I'd like to apologize to her for any hurt or B.S. I caused her or the Clintons or anybody else I may have mentioned," he said. "I was like a drunk saying that I was going to be on the Challenger next week.... My perceptions were not the greatest."He added that the allegations shouldn't harm a potential 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential bid."It's just ludicrous that the ravings of a drug-addicted actor would have any impact on who might be the President of the United States," he said.Sizemore's manager Charles Lago joined him for the interview, explaining that he received several phone calls and text messages from an unknown woman who said she had the recording of Sizemore and wanted $20,000 for it. She later reduced her asking price to $10,000 and eventually $6,000. Lago told HuffPost Live that his final communication with the woman was a text message that contained photos of Sizemore since picked up by the National Enquirer along with the message: "im not asking for tremendous amount 6,000 is my asking price or Tom is finished.""I'm not going to be extorted," Sizemore said. Lago added that Sizemore's attorneys "are dealing with this as we speak."Watch the full segment below:

This is excerpted from a November 10, 2011 keynote speech Bill Moyers delivered to public television representatives from around the country at American Public Television's annual conference. APT will be distributing his new program Moyers & Company starting January. Learn more. ---------------
I can't tell you how glad I am to be here. Or maybe I can. Last Friday, after filming in Washington for our new series, I was waiting at Union Station for the train back to New York when a woman about my age approached me with a quizzical look on her face. She asked: "Weren't you Bill Moyers?"
"Once upon a time," I answered.
She said, "I'll be darned.... I didn't think you were still with us."
"Well, I think I am," I answered. I guessed that she was a news junkie, so I said: "Maybe you have me confused with other on-air journalists, old-timers like David Brinkley. Or Bob Pierpoint. Or Howard K. Smith... Paul Duke...Charles Kuralt...All of them have passed on." She was still unsure, and said: "Well, I always watched you when you were alive." She'll have another chance come January. I trust she doesn't get Moyers & Company mixed up with The Walking Dead.
So considering the alternatives, I'm glad to be here. Very glad. Like crime boss Michael Corleone trying to go legitimate in Godfather III: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!" Now I know the bind you're in. As Eleanor Roosevelt said in the days leading up to World War II, we live in "no ordinary time." Things are tough. The financial and emotional distress created by the economic meltdown makes it all the more difficult for people to hear each other - and makes your job harder. Not only to raise operating funds, but to figure out how to offer programming that doesn't ignore the reality of America today: of men and women out of work; of parents wondering how they are going to pay the mortgage, rent, electricity or heating bill, let alone the car payment, gas, and phone bill; of college graduates who can't find jobs but have massive student loans to repay; of senior citizens with shrunken pensions. Just the other day, the government published a new report confirming that the poverty rate is the highest in 52 years - 49 million of our fellow Americans, including 16 million children. One in seven American households is "food insecure," living with the specter of too little to eat. And the inequality gap is greater than it's been since 1929. No wonder that in one recent survey, only 15% of Americans said our country is heading in the right direction. Washington is polarized and paralyzed, and our gross national psychology seems as bearish as our gross national product. On my desk I've kept a headline from the Wall Street Journal: "The End of American Optimism." And I think often of the story Mark Twain wrote called "The Terrible Catastrophe." In it he got his characters into such an impasse that no matter what anyone of them did, they would all be destroyed. Twain decided the situation was hopeless, and he ended the story by writing: "I have these characters in such a fix that I cannot get them out of it. Anyone who thinks he can, is welcome to try."
He doesn't tell us if anyone did.
In times like these, what do we do as public broadcasters?
During this new election season, for example, what's our role? Some admirable journalists in the media will do their best to follow the money, trace the patterns of influence and power, analyze the veracity or relevance of partisan claims, and place them in context. But as usual, the "horse race" will dominate the coverage. We've seen it already: Trump's in, Trump's out; Palin will, Palin won't; Bachmann's up, Bachmann's down; Christie will, Christie won't; Perry's Sir Galahad, no, Gomer Pyle; Cain's able, oops, Cain ain't; Obama's Jimmy Carter, no, he's Harry Truman - take your pick. But many Americans want a place where they can go for something different. And that's our opening - yours and mine. Our two major parties may be further apart ideologically than at any point since the late 19th century, and their most loyal voters seem "better sorted" than they used to be, with liberals more likely to be Democrats and conservatives more likely to be Republicans. Certainly the most passionate in both parties have moved further apart. But as the political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson write in their book, Winner Take All Politics, most Americans are just not that far apart in their views. Polarization reflects not the growing polarization of voters, they conclude, but the growing failure of politicians to respond to the real-life concerns of the broad majority of the country, people who have little time for politics because they're too consumed by the challenges of just getting by.
Yet these are people who also long to understand the relevance of policy to their lives - the connections between government decision-making and their own needs and duties. They rely on reason more than rant, and appreciate a place where conventional wisdom and misleading rhetoric are challenged, and where the true conversation of democracy continues - a conversation crucial to the quality of our lives and the character of our country.
Let me share with you a letter I received some weeks ago from a retired scholar of religion and society at one of our leading universities. I don't know him personally, but I found what he had to say compelling. It actually was intended for you, too - for all of us. Because he implored me to urge public broadcasters to address the crisis in American politics. Confidence in government keeps falling, he wrote, as more and more people come to see that the downward slide in their quality of life has been brought on by "engineered economic inequality." You and I, he said, have a special obligation to measure political speech against relevant data, to gauge political promises against deeds. Democracy, he said, lives or dies on the process of political representation. And representation cannot happen unless citizens see that their personal situations and the condition of the nation are inextricably linked - unless they understand how their difficulties in providing for their children, sustaining their marriages, getting further education or training, are caused directly and indirectly by tax, fiscal and monetary policies at the national level. So make it clear, he urged us, that no one can afford to be confused about politics; their livelihoods, and any hope for their children and generations beyond depend on what politicians do with their votes. So please, he asked, help us redress the imbalance between policy and partisanship. Clearly explain the distribution of tax burdens. Expose the special interest tax loopholes and how money and influence corrupt government. Show how increases in productivity connect to declining take-home wages, and unemployment rates to alcoholism, depression, divorce and suicide. In other words - and I could feel his sense of urgency - enable us to grasp the relationship between declining optimism about the future of the country and the social indicators of personal despair.
That's a tall order, and it comes at a time when, as the old song goes, we ain't got a barrel of money. Sometimes it feels like we don't even have the barrel. And yet, while reeling from the same hard slap of austerity as the rest of the 99 percent, there are ways we in public television can help Americans address the crisis of hope that has enveloped our nation. We start with assets - three things that that no other network or alliance of television stations possesses. We have our independence. Yes, we still rely on government funding and the largesse of foundations and corporations, but our core constituency is the public in public television. That's why we're here. And when we allow political or other outside pressures to misdirect our agenda, we're letting the public down. We've sometimes censored ourselves even before the threat has been whispered. But we are not owned by a multinational syndicate with a not-so-hidden agenda, like the one where the promise of "fair and balanced" has been twisted on its head into a perversion worthy of George Orwell. As the group 170 Million Americans for Public Broadcasting notes, "In an era of increased media consolidation, public broadcasters are among the last remaining locally owned and controlled sources of news, information and cultural programming." What an asset.
The second thing we have is trust. You may have seen the recent New York Times/ CBS News poll in which 89 percent of the American people say they don't trust government to do the right thing - the highest level ever. But for the past several years, as measured by the Roper Public Opinion Poll, Americans in every age, ethnicity, income and education group have ranked public television as America's most trusted institution. That's all of us: the stations, APT, PBS, NETA and others. At the beginning of this year, a survey of trust in television news, conducted by the group Public Policy Polling, found public television, quote "at the top of the heap," unquote. To keep that trust we must never flinch from reality, no matter the loud and malicious attacks from partisans who come down on us for reporting what contradicts their propaganda. When Newt Gingrich maliciously described public television as a "sandbox for rich people," we should have kicked the sand right back in his face. Bullies don't respect 97-lb weaklings until they fight back.
Ideology, remember, is a worldview people swear is true despite all the evidence to the contrary. And it's one reason the attack against reason and reality has reached the proportions of an unholy crusade. The anthropologist Marvin Harris wrote that Americans "desperately need to reaffirm the principle that it is possible to carry out an analysis of social life which rational human beings will recognize as being true, regardless of whether they happen to be women or men, whites or blacks, straights or gays, employers or employees, Jews, Muslims, or born-again Christians" Or skeptics and secularists. "The alternative is to stand by helplessly as special interest groups tear the United States apart in the name of their 'separate realities' or to wait until one of them grows strong enough to force its irrational and subjective brand of reality on all the rest." We've seen what happens then. We have to stand against that happening. The third and perhaps most important asset we have is community. Those people who remain our most loyal supporters, and who give, and give again, to support us, know that for all the flaws of public television, our fundamental assumptions come down on their side, and on the side of democracy. Working harder to live up to their expectations - especially now, in such difficult times - would do more than anything to dispel the general malaise about the state of our industry and free us from the constant defensive strategy that drains our energy and imagination. Public broadcasting has been around long enough to qualify as an American institution. Quite a remarkable achievement. But that's also far enough away from the original vision to forget what inspired our creation. As some of you know, the original Carnegie Commission report landed on my desk when I was a young White House assistant to President Lyndon Johnson. The Commission envisioned that public television "...should seek out able people whose talents might otherwise not be known and shared...provide a voice for groups that may otherwise be unheard...be a forum for debate and controversy...[and] have the means to be daring, to break away from narrow convention, to be human and earthy." I had helped organize the Peace Corps in the early 60s, and not since those heady days had I read anything as exciting. The statement President Johnson made when he signed the Public Broadcasting Act into law in 1967 remains a classic endorsement of what was really meant by the term "the public interest" in the Communication Act of 1934. Ten years later I had the privilege of serving on the second Carnegie Commission, convened to assess how public broadcasting had fared after its initial decade. That our report was largely ignored is not nearly as important as the verdict we rendered. We were candid about what was missing - enough funding, fearless independence and a clear grasp of what public media could mean to the public interest. It was an honest assessment, and for all the marvelous programming over the years, most of its concerns still hold true. It's just that today our situation is even more serious. The core problem is that we still don't have an expansive national vision of what we're about, where we want to go and what we want to become. Until we are able to say clearly and comprehensively what it is we really want to do, how much it will cost, and how we intend to get there, we can't blame Congress, the White House or even the foundations for not supporting us more fully. In our candid moments, usually while bending elbows at the bar, we admit to each other that we're mired in a sclerotic system that binds us to a politically cautious set of national entities that are both underfunded and themselves incapable of leading anyone towards a more vigorous notion of our future.
I know from talking to station managers that there's been more discussion of what's needed, at least internally, than producers like me may realize. But I also know that discussion has been halting in its resolve and implementation. There's much talk about this going on among all your affinity groups and their coalition in the AGC, but it's been difficult in such forums to frame the vision and the plan. Further, stations can only carry it so far on their own. Everyone involved in the system has a vested interest in the status quo, no matter how fragile and perilous. In truth, we all know that the better solutions demand a major overhaul of the national system. Yet there's a huge vacuum between the system, nationally and locally, and the big foundations and no one has yet been inspired or capable enough to link the two at the level of a consensus national plan.
There are always people who remain afraid of change or an unknown process, fearful of where it might lead. But by contrast, the British and Canadians go through periodic charter reviews that invoke a national conversation; there's a culture of discussion and planning for public media in those nations that help them survive even the worst assaults from detractors or vested interests. This could be a reason that public support for public media in nations like the UK exceeds $80 per capita, while we're still limping along on $1.49 per capita. Perhaps it explains why, despite this multiplatform universe, we still have no serious, morning, national public television service other than programming for kids. As I've said before, Amy Goodman's Democracy Now is there for the asking - and Amy would bring with it a charismatic talent for raising funds for local stations that would build your membership. And there are other serious possibilities for such a day-starting service. See me if you want to know more. In the meantime, I'm here to tell you that even within the fiscal crisis public television currently faces, we have an opportunity to serve the public - to renew our bond to our communities.
You may not have money for in-depth documentaries or other high-end productions but you have cameras, microphones, studios and the trust of the community. You can be the ombudsman for the public within your reach, provide the venue for forums, teach-ins, town meetings, and debates over the issues that matter to people where they live, telecast in an atmosphere of openness and clarity without the mean and mindless rhetoric or cant that are so triumphant today. Civic engagement is the lifeblood of democracy and the bedrock of its legitimacy. No media can nurture, foster, and empower it the way we can.
And there are other ways to tell your communities what's going on that they need to know. Everyone knows there's a crisis in journalism; commercial broadcasters and newspapers have cut more than 15,000 local journalism jobs in recent years. Watchdog reporting - covering city councils, school boards, state governments, public utilities, public services - is imperiled. The FCC commissioned a study on the information needs of communities and is now holding hearings around the country on how to improve local news. Several foundations are getting into the act. And some journalism schools - maybe even one near you, a potential partner in reviving local journalism. Before you say this is a pipe dream, given our hard times: I am old enough to remember when public television stations created low-budget nightly broadcasts while local newspapers were on strike, bringing reporters into the studio to discuss the stories that no longer had a venue in print. It's still a fact that the most powerful production value can be the human voice and the human face. The talent is out there - you'd be surprised how willing they are to work. You have the airtime; offer them the chairs and table and let them go at it. I'll wager there are local institutions, foundations, organizations, and individuals who can be enlisted to put up the money for you to signify in this way. KPBS in San Diego has pioneered on this front. Check it out.
Just two nights ago, as I was cleaning off my desk to get ready for the trip to Memphis, I had a call from Chris Daggett, the dynamic president of the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation in New Jersey. He was excited to tell me about the collaboration taking shape to push back the news blackout that has been spreading in New Jersey since the Newark Star-Ledger cut loose 45% of its newsroom staff in 2008, and The New York Times closed its bureau in the state capitol of Trenton. Now, New Jersey Public Radio (owned and operated by New York Public Radio) is creating the New Jersey News Service and Montclair State University is establishing the NJ Digital Media Initiative, and they'll work together to deliver public interest journalism for the twenty-one counties, 566 municipalities, 604 school districts, and all the independent authorities - almost too many to count - that operate in the state. These are the political and governmental entities that affect the daily lives of citizens, from taxes to law enforcement to our children's' minds. Their impact reminds me of how the journalist and historian Richard Reeves responded when a student asked him for his definition of real news. Richard answered: "Real news is the news we need to keep our freedoms." Keep your eye on this new development in public media--it could turn out to be a model for the future. Meanwhile, let me offer just a few other ideas for you to consider: Take a whole evening of prime time and give it to a forum for the fight in your neighborhoods over charter schools. Do the same for other distressed public institutions - your libraries, for example. Or your parks; the governor of New Jersey announced this week he's going to privatize our state parks - turn them over to corporations to run for a profit. Why not a teach-in on whether that's a good idea - and who wins and who loses if it happens? Or how about one week inviting as many social workers as you can get into your studio and asking them to share what they see every day - how people are coping each day with these worst hard times? Do a series of workshops on Occupy Wall Street, pro and con. Out there in Iowa, find the lady carrying the placard I saw last weekend on television that read: "I couldn't afford to buy a politician so I bought this sign." Bring her into the studio with her local member of Congress - have them talk frankly to each other about their different perceptions of money in politics. Do an evening of prime time on the fight going on right now in your state over redistricting - gerrymandering - the outcome will influence your state's position and power for the next ten years. Get folks aware and involved. If you don't, who will? Certainly not the commercial stations in your market, that's for sure.
If you're worried about the size of your audience for such programs, think again. Despite the thousands of cable, satellite and Internet options, the doom-and-gloom reports of declining audiences, you don't have to play by the numbers, to compare your stations with those earning the highest ratings by groveling to the lowest common denominator. We've proven it with our programs time and again. It's not the number of people who watch but the imprint on those who do, and the cumulative impact of your programming over time.
Do we want younger viewers, the famous 18-49 metric? Of course. But listen up. One of the smartest number guys in the business is David Poltrack, the long time chief research officer of CBS, the grand poobah of ratings and statistics. He recently confessed to a professional audience that "reliance on the 18 to 49 demographic is hazardous to all media and marketers... There is no link, none, between the age of the specified demographic delivery of the campaign and the sales generated by that campaign."
This throws everything we have always believed about television audiences out the window. Marty Kaplan at the University of Southern California says, "The metrics are wearing no clothes." So let's not sell our birthright for fickle, fugitive numbers. Throw out mandates to get a 1, 2, or 3. It actually turns out that the audience more and more coveted is the audience public television has always had and which will continue to grow right into our hands. There are 80 million baby boomers out there. Another one turns fifty every 7.6 seconds. Graying boomers are the big catch -- waiting to be hooked on what matters, ready for the serious side of public television. The ones most likely to become sustaining, dues-paying members.
These are people who have entered what educator Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot calls "The Third Chapter" of their lives. When I spoke with her on the Journal a couple of years ago she told me that boomers "were talking about new learning in their lives, new adventures that they were taking, new risks...this is the most, perhaps, transformative time of our lives," she said. "Most exciting, in terms of new learning. Limitless in its opportunities...continuing to do work that's meaningful. Continuing to figure out a way to be productive. To be purposeful. To be creative. To be innovative."
And then Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot mentioned something completely relevant to the problem I've been discussing with you today. She said, "There's a way in which this reduction in our resources forces us to think more dynamically, more creatively, about how we can do more with less. In fact, how we can shape a new legacy in this time of sacrifice."
"A new legacy in this time of sacrifice." Now there's a challenge to public TV. Hard times give us perhaps our last and best chance to make ourselves indispensable to America - a chance to resurrect ideals long deferred by the unhappy combination of financial constraints and political pressure. The key to our future in the digital revolution may well rest on our analog past. We can build on our ability to give time and breathing room to the on-going conversation that America must have if its ideals of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" -grounded in political action - are to survive, and if "We, The People" are to save our social compact.
One friend in the system brought me up short the other day when, harking back to the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, he asked, "If you had to do it over again, what changes would you make?" I can't get his question out of my mind, although I don't yet have a full answer. I'd certainly call for a universal, system-wide, public media news service in every U.S. community, modeled along the lines of NPR and more of its stations. Some PTV stations have struggled to do this, but with two few resources. I'd ask CPB to put much more of its funds into this and at the same time to get serious in convening foundations large and small all over the country to make it happen: Give our influential friends and supporters something big to back. (I'd also inform certain foundations that keep telling us what to do but then refuse to follow through with real money to put up or shut up.) And since David H. Koch of Koch Industries is on the board of both WGBH and WNET, I'd ask him to round up his billionaire buddies - and in a non-partisan spirit reach out to civic-minded progressive billionaires like George Soros - and together create an independent, fully endowed, self-governing production center (free of any partisan strings or influence) for American drama that would bring our epic history and culture to the screen just like we've brought over the Brits'. Downton Abbey, make room for Jefferson's Monticello! Now there's an Upstairs Downstairs story the public would make a pledge to see.
Come to think of it: If we had it to do over, I'd reach into American history for a really big idea. Remember the Articles of Confederation? That was the agreement that legally established the USA as a confederation of sovereign states - "a firm league of friendship," they called it. The Articles held those 13 states together in the beginning, but were too weak for the long run; the new government couldn't even raise the money for its modest needs -its paper money was useless, hence the saying, "not worth a continental." The idea grew for a "Grand Convention" in Philadelphia to amend the Articles of Confederation and strengthen them. But once the delegates met and began talking, thrashing out their differences and making their compromises, they wound up writing a new, spare and powerful constitution that saved the fledgling republic and survives today. Why can't public television learn from that experience? Forty years after the founding, our "Articles of Confederation" aren't working all that well, either. Sure, over these four decades we've provided America with extraordinary fare that has touched and enriched the hearts, minds, and lives of millions. But we are in denial if we don't read the signs. Time's running out. We're just hanging on, leaking away, fraying at the margins; scrambling year by year to survive, hoping all the while for what in an era of trillion-dollar deficits and austerity will never be - more and more funding from Congress. What we need is a makeover of our own - a rebirth, yes, of vision, imagination, and creativity, but above all a structure and scheme for the 2lst century, one that uses the resources that the digital platform provides to realize the goals of our founders: diversity, public access, civic discourse, experimentation, a welcoming place for independent spirits. One of my good friends in the field - a station manager - was scratching his head the other day as he wondered aloud why there has never been a comprehensive system-wide discussion about fundamental change in our Rube Goldberg system. From the second Carnegie Commission on, through the latest Aspen meetings, we haven't engaged in a full and frank examination of the system - the full nature of the process - top to bottom and with all the interested internal and external public and private parties participating. So why not have our own "Grand Convention" - a week-long gathering of the public television community? Delegates from the stations (large and small); board members, managers, and programmers; a cadre from Crystal City; representative producers and some "viewers like you" (chosen by straw, if that's the way to do it) would convene for a conversation about where we are, what's not working, where we want to go, and what the journey's going to cost. We could even stream it live on every public station website in the country.
What would come of it? Nobody knows. But at least we'd be alive again - to each other, to ideas, to new possibilities, and to the American people - the public, I say again, in public broadcasting.
Impractical? Maybe. But Albert Einstein did say: "If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."
Of one thing I am sure. Such a constitutional convention will not occur if the stations just sit by and wait for others to convene it. Your own national agencies have been unable to do it; Congress, successive White Houses, foundations, think tanks and other institutions have failed to act in concerted fashion. No one is informed enough, or willful enough, and no one leads. You, the stations, have more recently been trying to take on that role. But may I say you're still hesitant, unsure of yourselves, setting only modest planning goals. I may be being too presumptive and sounding like the proverbial Dutch Uncle, but I think you are the ones who are going to have to lead this process with the vision, the in-depth research, thoughtful analysis and multiple scenarios planning it will require.
Now's the time to be bold and broadly thinking. Don't settle for simple short-term fixes. Think bigger, more aggressively about whole new multicast and online local and national program service plans and through them a much richer embrace with all the citizens of this nation.
Remember, there are still millions and millions of people who need us. And millions more who will find us if we but give them the real news, the cultural experiences, and the opportunity to learn that are otherwise missing in their lives. People like those construction workers out west who many years ago happened on our series of "Six Great Ideas" - spirited debates among educators, business executives, lawyers, poets and jurists on liberty, justice, equality, truth, beauty, and goodness. They wrote to say:
(We) are sure that it' s just due to our well-known ignorance as tradesmen that not a single one of us had ever heard of you until one Sunday afternoon we were watching public television and [you] came on with Six Great Ideas ...We listened intensely and soon became addicted and have been ever since. We never knew a world of ideas existed...We thank you and we applaud you...We may be plumbers during the day, but at lunch time and at night and on the weekends, we are [now] philosophers at large. God bless you.
Or like the housewife in Utah, who discovered our series on the Constitution and wrote to say:
I have never written a letter like this before. I am a full-time mother of four children under seven years and I am entirely busy with the ordinary things of family life. However, I want to thank you very much for [your series.] I am moved by the experience of listening at the feet of thoughtful citizens, justices and philosophers of substance. All these are people with whom I will never converse on my own, and I am grateful to you for having brought these conversations within my sphere. I am aware that I lack eloquence to express the measure of my heart's gratitude. I can say, however, that these programs are a landmark among my life's experiences. Among all the things I must teach my children, a healthy interest in understanding the Constitution now ranks very prominently. Thank you.
Sandbox for the rich? Yeah, sure.
And like the fellow in Colorado who followed our series that sought to cover the election with respect for the whole motion of the race and not just the impassioned moments of conflict, controversy, and sound bites. He wrote: Your series accomplished the impossible. As a sixties college graduate, disillusioned Vietnam combat veteran, embittered anti-war author, and indifferent citizen, I never thought I'd see the day when I'd register to vote... But yesterday I registered and November 4 I'll vote. [The series] spurred me to again participate in our democracy. Thanks. It's good to be back.
So it is. I'm glad to be back, too. Mighty glad, and thanks for your welcome. Eighteen months ago, we took leave from the conversation. And we've missed it. Let's keep talking. This Blogger's Books from

Criticizing Oprah: A Media Curmudgeon Takes on the Patron Saint of Celebrity	Entertainment News
Share

Comments
It's the curse of the critic to be a perpetual cynic.
Where others see stardust, we must see ego and opportunity. Where others see altruism, we must look for the self-interest and hypocrisy. It's the gig, people.
Nowhere has this cynicism loomed larger for me than in considering the Queen of All Media, Oprah Winfrey.
Much as I've admired her altruism and principled stands, I find myself quite ambivalent about O's overall impact as a media figure. When she brought her big-ticket, five-hour motivational Live Your Best Life tour to my town a few years ago, I wrote about how fan worship of her work seemed almost religious; and among all the journalists who covered her that day, I was the only one so cynical that my photographer, Jaime Francis, snapped a pic of my scowling at the Queen and taped it to my office door.
So, as I have waded through the orgy of media coverage on O's new school for girls in South Africa, I was struck by a particular comment she made about education in America.
Here's what she said, according to Newsweek magazine: ""I became so frustrated with visiting inner-city schools [in America] that I just stopped going. The sense that you need to learn just isn't there," she said. "If you ask the kids what they want or need, they will say an iPod or some sneakers. In South Africa, they don't ask for money or toys. They ask for uniforms so they can go to school."
This, of course, caused quite a ripple through the punditocracy, wininng kudos from, among others, conservative blowhard Rush Limbaugh, Pulitzer Prize-winning Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page and HuffPost blogger Karen Russell. And why not? the materialism of American kids -- even those who are dirt poor -- has been well-documented. A reporter pal told me yesterday that he's even seen some homeless people with laptops and email accounts. Frustration over the country's growing education problems makes it easy to wish these kids would just get wise, already, and start cracking the books.
It is tough to argue with a media figure who puts her money where her mores are like Winfrey. Her $40 million pledge to build a much-needed quality school for girls is the kind of direct, involved altruism we have come to expect from a billlionaire who handed out new homes to Katrina victims and prodded her sizable following to buy goods through U2 singer Bono's Red campaign, where some proceed went to fight AIDS in Africa (only Oprah could make the slogan "save lives while you shop" feel like bona fide philanthropy)
But then the critic in me rears it's ugly head, and I have to point out a truth that is both inconvenient and troubling.
Winfrey is part of the very problem she criticizes.
When you consider why American kids might react so differently from their South African counterparts, the pervasiveness of media -- and the very specific media of American pop culture -- must be a factor. And I don't just mean the rap videos clogging BET and elsewhere.
Who is celebrated the most in our culture? Is it the intellectuals and thinkers -- scientists and doctors and great writers? Or is it celebrities like Britney and Paris and Brad and Jennifer and, oh yeah, Oprah?
When a recent episode on Winfrey's own show centered on the homeless, she didn't get a report on the issue from the great journalists at the Chicago Reporter who have written well about this plight in her own backyard, or from somebody else with a long track record of exploring these issues. She asked Anderson Cooper, who fit the report in-between his work for 60 Minutes and his day job on CNN. When she needs emotive reporting on issues overseas, she doesn't often tap folks who have been in the trenches for decades and know the issues intimately, she gives precious airtime to former View co-host Lisa Ling.
Not that I don't love me some Coop and Ling. But those moves also provide a lesson; that celebrity -- and an image which resonates with Winfrey's audience demographic -- matters nearly as much as expertise.
We have huge industries which generate massive profits by selling products as a lifestyle. These days, you don't just buy an iPod; that purchase is a gateway into a tech-savvy life that is cool, cutting edge and effortlessly stylish. Everything from video games to sneakers and gum is sold this way, using media which follows kids everywhere -- on cellphones, on the Internet, on the backs of their friends' clothing and in the lyrics of the songs they love. And many of the sponsors Oprah does business with are the prime cultivators of these messages.
So much in our culture tells young people they should lust after the latest product by Apple, Verizon, Jimmy Choo or Martha Stewart. And Oprah, whose fetishizing of celebrity and high-end consumer goods is legend, has fed that jones as much as anyone in modern media. I have seen the list of her favorite things -- which has its own website here -- and it ranges from a $20 pair of cashmere socks to a $600 Philip Stein teslar watch and beyond.
In Africa, they learn education is the gateway to a better life. In America, kids learn an iPod or Michael Jordan sneakers deliver that pathway -- lessons taught, in part, by the commercials packed into TV shows which they spend more than four hours every day consuming. The heroes they see feted on magazine covers and TV talk shows aren't geneticists, college professors, lawyers or accountants; they are the the Jessica Simpsons, the P. Diddys and even the K-Feds. Can we really look at our most underprivileged young people and fault them for learning the lessons of materialism and celebrity obsession that our media culture feeds them every day?
Oprah, who manipulates her image deftly as any celebrity in modern times, knows this. So why is she criticizing America's youth for serving a beast she helped create?

This week's news that support for the legalization of marijuana has reached a record high of 50% ought to bother Obama's re-election team a little bit. No, not because pot's more popular than the president, although that really says a lot. The problem, rather, is that Obama's heavily publicized and widely praised promise to respect state medical marijuana laws has recently been shattered into more pieces than the campaign can count.
In only a few short months, the Obama administration has presided over a vicious series of political assaults on medical marijuana patients and providers across the nation, carried out by numerous federal agencies. The situation just continues to get more ugly and insane from one week to the next:
Federal prosecutors have threatened to arrest state employees for administering state laws, resulting in stalled programs and reduced patient access.
U.S. Attorneys in California recently revived the Bush era tactic of threatening to seize property from landlords who rent to medical marijuana facilities.
After 9 years of failing to respond, the DEA recently denied a petition to reschedule marijuana, ignoring a vast body of scientific evidence proving the drug's medical efficacy.
Federal threats have caused numerous banks to close the accounts of businesses that provide medical marijuana to qualified patients.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms issued a surprising statement that medical marijuana patients may not purchase firearms.
The IRS is shaking down medical marijuana providers for millions of dollars based on an obscure tax provision aimed at drug traffickers.
A federal prosecutor even threatened to target newspapers that run ads for medical marijuana services.
And, of course, the DEA continues to raid tax-paying businesses that are legal under state law.
As the American people appear all but prepared to end our war on marijuana once and for all, the federal government is busy doubling down on the even-more-mindless battle against people who use the drug medicinally. The disconnect is staggering and continues to expand as support for full legalization surges into the majority, while medical marijuana maintains the massive 80% national support it's had for some time now. Today, at this very moment, support for the cause of marijuana reform has never been greater, and tomorrow it will be greater still. The surging momentum of the issue is generating discussion all around us, even by the media that once ignored it, which now misses no opportunity to cover the controversy over cannabis.
Alas, it seems the only person not talking about it is our president, who campaigned as an agent of change, who once spoke with seeming sincerity of the need to "rethink and decriminalize our marijuana laws," who was elected after promising to reform federal enforcement priorities in medical marijuana states, and who earned universal praise from the press and the public when his administration announced its intention to do just that.
Whether deliberately or through a willful failure to follow the issue at all, Obama has thrown all of it away amidst an extraordinary stampede of over-the-top anti-pot posturing that makes Bush's drug war leadership look lazy by comparison. The situation is spiraling as we speak into new depths of absurdity, and many of the people who've made things this bad are busy brainstorming ways to make it worse.
Still, if there is one lesson to be learned from the recent history of marijuana policy in America, it is that support for reform is galvanized when the law is enforced in a manner that shocks the public conscience. The Obama Administration's past attempts at pandering to demands for a more measured criminal justice philosophy prove that he was once paying attention. Now, as the tension escalates with each new federal threat, Obama's silence on the matter is becoming conspicuous and embarrassing.
The time has come for the president, and no one else, to come forward and explain to the American people why war is still being waged against patients and providers in states that permit the medical use of marijuana. What the people want has been perfectly clear for a long time, and if we can't have it, we deserve an honest answer as to why.
