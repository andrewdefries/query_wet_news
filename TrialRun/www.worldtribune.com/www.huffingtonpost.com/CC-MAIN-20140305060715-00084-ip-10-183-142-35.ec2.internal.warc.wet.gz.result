With all the buzz over Asbury Park's potential conversion to "beach top-optional" status, it's easy to forget about New York's pre-existing nude beaches. Nudity has actually long been welcomed at beaches throughout the Tri-State area, thanks in part to Fire Island's relaxed stance on beach wear. Take a look at the list below to see where you can dare to go bare.

If you want to roar like Simba -- post "Hakuna Matata" song-and-dance number -- then you're in luck. Our friends at CartoonBrew.com unearthed this behind-the-scenes video of famed voice actor Frank﻿ Welker recording the lion roars for Disney classic, "The Lion King." And it looks like all you need to roar like Simba is ... a trash can? Yep. Welker used a trash can to help him muster up those deep -- somewhat frightening -- roaring noises. After watching the video above, it's pretty easy to see why Welker is one of the most well-known and respected voice actors in the business. With over 3,000 credits to his name, Welker has voiced or appeared in 97 movies with a combined gross revenue of over $6.4 billion, making him the most successful actor in Hollywood. Take a look at some of Welker's most memorable voice roles below.
Frank Welker as Megatron Frank Welker in 'Scooby-Doo'
Frank Welker as Galvatron
Frank Welker in 'Family Guy'
Frank Welker as Fred Jones in 'Scooby-Doo'
Frank Welker as Nibbler in 'Futurama'
Frank Welker as Soundwave & Dr. Claw

Below are the remarks I gave at a press briefing on June 3 responding to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's conference in Washington, DC, at which conservative operatives worked not only to promote their usual social agenda, but also to portray their radical economic policies as moral.
Thanks everyone for coming today, I know you're all very busy.
We're here to make some very important points about what's happening in faith and politics at this crucial moment.
Religious right operatives are not speaking for the mainstream faith community as they try to mobilize Christians behind a radical economic agenda. Their agenda of punishing hard-hit families with drastic, irresponsible budget cuts while giving trillions in tax cuts to millionaires is immoral, and people recognize that.
Some conservative religious operatives like Ralph Reed have been hard at work portraying their extreme agenda as mainstream.
They embrace greed: They want trillions in tax cuts for millionaires and powerful corporations -- even though these policies exploded our debt, and the wealthiest one percent of Americans already control 40% of the wealth. They reject compassion and fairness for families: They want to make drastic budget cuts that will cause concrete hardship for struggling families, seniors, and the most vulnerable -- even as people struggle to find work and poverty is at staggering levels.
This is an immoral agenda, and people of faith are rejecting it.
A recent poll by Public Religion Research Institute showed that large majorities of America's largest religious groups -- including Catholics and white evangelicals -- find the concentration of wealth to be a major problem. The same poll found that large majorities of Catholics and protestants support the wealthiest Americans paying higher taxes, and white evangelicals are evenly split on this issue. And numerous polls show Americans across the spectrum reject Paul Ryan's plan to privatize Medicare, slash programs that protect families, and give millionaires tax cuts they don't need.
The radical economic agenda that religious right political operatives are pushing resembles the teachings of Ayn Rand more than the teachings of Jesus Christ. Politicians like Paul Ryan cite Rand as an inspiration, and religious right operatives are lining up to support Ryan's budget priorities.
Rand believed in selfishness and greed. Religious right operatives support giving trillions of dollars to the very richest Americans.
Rand held compassion and love for the weak in contempt. Religious right operatives seek to slash programs that protect the poor, struggling families, and the least among us.
On question after question, Ayn Rand and Christian moral principles are directly at odds. Yet religious right operatives are mobilizing en masse to support a budget that reflects Rand's teachings.
Prominent mainstream faith leaders across the country who are more interested in upholding the church's teachings about justice and the common good are standing together in overwhelming opposition to these extreme, immoral budget priorities. Earlier this year, some in Congress advanced a budget that threatened to decimate programs that save thousands of lives every year and help vulnerable families put food on the table and get the healthcare they need. Confronted with this injustice, a remarkably diverse group of nationally prominent clergy, from the head of the National Association of Evangelicals to African-American denominational leaders to leading Catholic bishops formed a "Circle of Protection" to stand up for these desperately necessary protections. As Congress pushed through Congressman Ryan's budget, 30 Protestant bishops called the plan "morally indefensible," and 70 Catholic scholars issued a letter to John Boehner calling on him to turn away from his economic policies, which fly in the face of Catholic social teaching. And Faithful America gathered thousands of petition signatures calling on Paul Ryan and John Boehner to support economic policies that protect the poor and honor their faith's teachings.
The message from the mainstream faith community is clear -- the economic agenda pushed by religious right political operatives is extreme, and it contradicts Christian moral values.

Jim Wallis: Matthew 25: Why We Went to the White House
Whenever a new budget or deficit reduction proposal is put forth, somebody should ask how it will impact the poorest and most vulnerable. This is a biblical question, a fair question and a question of justice. Jim Wallis: The Spiritually Viral Hunger Fast
The hunger fast for a moral budget has gone spiritually viral. Ten days ago, we announced that the budget debate had become a moral crisis. We now have more than 30,000 participants and are still growing.	Jim Wallis: 10 Reasons Why I'm Fasting for a Better Budget
Every Christian, regardless of political affiliation, is called to take up the cause of the poor and the needy because that is God's heart, and we will be calling every legislator who says they are a Christian.	David Beckmann: Fast, Pray and Protect Hungry People
I believe strongly in the need to balance the budget, but there has to be a better way. If Congress makes these cuts, people at risk of hunger in the U.S. will feel the impact immediately.	Sheldon C. Good: A Budget To Protect The Poor
As legislators fight over what and how much and where to cut, Christian activists are advocating to preserve the lives, dignity and human rights of the poor.	Brian D. McLaren: Good Friday Evangelicals
As we move from Palm Sunday through Holy Week, many of us feel that Good Friday is our dominant reality: the guys on the side of money and power seem to keep winning.	Jim Wallis: Pray, Fast, Act: Spiritual Escalation in Response to Political Extremism
I am joining Ambassador Tony Hall, David Beckmann of Bread for the World, ONE, American Jewish World Service, Meals on Wheels, Islamic Relief and a broad coalition to fast, pray and act.	Around the Web:
