Obama Borrows From the JFK Playbook on Ukraine
Stephen Schlesinger
Author and Fellow at the Century Foundation	President Obama appears to be using a strategic approach to the Ukrainian situation that is similar in many respects to that employed by his Democratic Party predecessor, President John F. Kennedy, in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In both cases, the two leaders were dealing with secret, unexpected, armed missions launched by aggressive Russian leaders against Western interests, with little precedent in both cases on how to handle the crises. Obviously the Cuban missile affair was a far more perilous showdown than what is now happening in the Ukraine. The Cuban affair had doomsday-type consequences. The invasion of Crimea does not entail any possibility of nuclear exchanges between two nations. But in other respects, there are parallels for Obama.

We Were Attacked, But Will Not Be Silenced
Nadia Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina
When we arrived to visit a women's prison with our prison-reform organization, unknown men attacked us with blinding liquid. We believe the attack was sanctioned by the Russian Federal Security Service.
Comments (31) The Great U-Turn
Robert Reich
Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, 'Beyond Outrage'	Do you recall a time in America when the income of a single school teacher or baker or salesman or mechanic was enough to buy a home, have two cars, and raise a family? I remember.
Comments (44) Let's Fix a Justice System That Isn't Working
Harry Belafonte
Entertainer & Activist	There is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.
Comments (24) Who Creates Drama at HBO? Very Few Women or People of Color
Maureen Ryan
TV critic, The Huffington Post	It might be useful to take a break from talking about what individual dramas are doing and talk instead about what HBO -- and other critically acclaimed TV outlets -- are not doing.
Comments (430) Businesses Should Stand Up to Climate Change Deniers
Richard Branson
Founder, Virgin Group	More businesses should be following Apple's stance in encouraging more investment in sustainability. While Tim Cook told sustainability skeptics to "get out of our stock," I would urge climate change deniers to get out of our way.
Comments (46) When Your Body Says 'No More Screens'
Lori Leibovich
Executive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post	It hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.
Comments There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery
Sen. Bernie Sanders
Independent U.S. Senator from Vermont	The Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.
Comments (121) I'm a Footballer Who Happens to Wear Hijab -- I Didn't Need FIFA to Tell Me That
Shireen Ahmed
Writer and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sports	How can I laud FIFA for striking down a law that should have never been implemented in the first place? Being ripped from the game because a lot of white, privileged men decided it was dangerous for me and the sport was torturous. Football is for all of us. It should always have been.
Comments (12) Would You Wish Your Life on Your Children?
Robin Kevles-Necowitz
Licensed professional counselor and parenting coach	Childhood isn't easy. And it's a whole lot harder when parents are counting on their children to make them happy -- with a good grade, a positive attitude, a full social calendar, a home run at the game, a scholarship, great SAT scores and perfect attendance.
Comments The Truth About Chipotle's New Vegetarian Option
Emily Cohn
Editor, HuffPost Business	It didn't take me long to realize what Chipotle was really doing by adding tofu (aka Sofritas) to its menu: It had cleverly devised a way to get vegetarians to pay more for a meatless burrito. Now, vegetarians can spend just as much as omnivores.
Comments (39) Advice for Everyone Under Age 90 (From a 90-Year-Old)
Larry Crandell
Volunteer & Raconteur	I'm older than Scotch tape. And it was invented in 1930. I've lived through the Great Depression and served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. At 90 and ¾, I only date women who like antiques.
Comments (23) Will Crimea Save NATO? Not So Fast
Sean Kay
Sean Kay is Robson Professor of Politics at Ohio Wesleyan University	As significant as Crimea is, there are no solutions to either Ukraine -- or North Korea, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iran -- that do not involve the Russians, as unappetizing as that might be. We face tough choices that can only be answered with a wider set of interests at play.
Comments Learning to Love My Unemployed Self
Katie Gibson
Freelance radio producer and audio editor	I had everything. I had the perfect apartment, the perfect lifestyle (whatever that even means), the perfect husband, the perfect dog, the perfect job. I was bouncy lollipops and rainbows happy. That is, until it all fell apart faster than you can say downsizing.
Comments A Mother at Mothers and Sons
Tovah Feldshuh
Actress	Mothers and Sons, refreshingly imagines a world that the backyard barbecue guests of my childhood could probably never have imagined
Comments Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform to Help Immigrant Victims of Violence
Rep. Gwen Moore
U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 4th Congressional District	Comprehensive immigration reform would lift millions of immigrants out of the shadows, reducing women's vulnerability to abuse and exploitation and eliminating one of the major barriers to seeking assistance. Further, many women would no longer have to make the heart-wrenching decision to stay in an abusive situation out of fear of being torn apart from their families.
Comments Marijuana Taxes in Colorado -- An Early Clue
Pat Oglesby
Lawyer; Former Congressional tax staffer	Across America, lawmakers are eyeing tax revenue from legalized marijuana. In a few days, the Colorado Department of Revenue is due to report how much marijuana tax was paid there for January, the first full month of recreational sales anywhere ever.
Comments The Pentagon's Phony Budget War
Mattea Kramer
Research director, National Priorities Project	Despite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.
Comments Could Yoga Be the Secret to Motivating Millennials?
Michael Anthony Fernandez
Founder, Factory 360	Would you ever think that Courtney Love would be the inspiration for restructuring an entire office culture -- which included building a yoga studio in our new office? Well, she was, and this is what happened.
Comments Why Being My Brother's Keeper Matters
Gov. Deval Patrick
Governor, Massachusetts	As a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.
Comments (14) Paul Ryan Is a Charlatan, Not a Serious 'Policy Wonk'
Peter Dreier
E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental College	For too long, reporters have been bamboozled by Ryan, who claims to be a both a budget expert and something of a social philosopher. But he's just a slick talker who appears to have flunked basic math in high school or college, because his budget numbers never add up.
Comments (33) The 10 Worst Pieces of Advice From Susan Patton's 'Marry Smart'
Claire Fallon
Books Editor, The Huffington Post	Here are the 10 worst pieces of dating advice from Marry Smart -- and trust me, there was plenty of bad advice from which to choose.
Comments (35) 10 Reasons I'm a Funeral Director
Caleb Wilde
Sixth generation licensed funeral director	Perhaps there's no greater freedom than to live life with a healthy relationship with death. That healthy relationship allows you embracing each moment, realizing that we are not promised tomorrow. This good relationship with death has been given to me by the funeral profession.
Comments Why Washington Doesn't Want to Leave Afghanistan
Tom Engelhardt
Editor, TomDispatch.com	Washington and Kabul have, for endless months, been performing a strange pas de deux over the issue of American withdrawal. The less Karzai complied, the more Obama administration and Pentagon officials betrayed an overwhelming need to stay.
Comments On a Random Day in the U.S. There Are More Than 66,000 Requests for Help Escaping Domestic Violence
Soraya Chemaly
Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that order	The dynamics of domestic violence are complex and changing them requires not just one thing to change, but many things simultaneously.
Comments Understanding CBO's Minimum-Wage Report
Scott Lilly
Senior fellow, Center for American Progress	As the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.
Comments How Netflix Is Ruining My Relationship (And Might Be Ruining Yours)
Zoë Triska
Senior Books Editor, The Huffington Post	What's not so nice? Having to wait for said person you love in order to watch the rest of the fully-released season. Here are the worst things for me about watching a show with my beloved.
Comments Why Proponents of Raising the NBA Age Minimum Are Full of Beans
Jonathan Weiler
Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel Hill	The NBA's owners may sincerely believe that they will be improving the overall product if they start barring players under 20. But they will be sincerely mistaken.
Comments In Defense Of Adverbs
Maddie Crum
Books Editor, The Huffington Post	This forceful call for more forceful writing is misguided; adverbs can be phonetically pleasing, can imbue sentences with subtlety, and should not be entirely shunned.
Comments CSW58 -- Imagining a Different World for Women
Cheryl Saban Ph.D.
Author and advocate for women and children	The status of the world's women will be discussed in depth during the upcoming CSW58 in New York City. The Commission of the Status of Women is arguably the highest authority on issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women at the global level.
Comments 5 Ways Your Social Media Sharing Habit Can Put You At Risk
Adam Levin
Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911	The amount that we share online makes us more likely to feel like sharing widely is a normal thing, online and off. But the ease with which we publicize seemingly harmless bits of personal information online and off is often what scam artists rely upon when they go phishing.

If there was one frail, painfully naive hope I harbored when I left for vacation over a week ago, it was for all this national nonsense over the proposed Cordoba Initiative community center in Lower Manhattan to get sorted out while I was away. Alas and alack, this was not to be! The past week has brought more violent idiocy (now, Cordoba opponents are attacking people for looking vaguely Islamic), and a lot of shameful cowardice -- including the most ridiculous walk-back President Barack Obama has ever offered. Over at Salon, Alex Pareene has the best bestiary of heroes and jackasses related to this issue (progressives looking for people to look up to should turn their jaded eyes to people like Grover Norquist and Ted Olson!).
One thing hasn't changed since I've been away, of course! There is already a mosque at Ground Zero and there will continue to be a mosque at Ground Zero once this toxic political geekshow moves on to its next scheduled stop.
At any rate, if you're wondering what the world's assemblage of al Qaeda death cultists think about this whole matter, wonder no more! They have a message for Cordoba opponents, and that message reads, "Thanks for your support of international terrorism!" Per Scott Shane at the New York Times:
Some counterterrorism experts say the anti-Muslim sentiment that has saturated the airwaves and blogs in the debate over plans for an Islamic center near ground zero in Lower Manhattan is playing into the hands of extremists by bolstering their claims that the United States is hostile to Islam. [...]
Evan F. Kohlmann, who tracks militant Web sites at the security consulting firm Flashpoint Global Partners, said supporters of Al Qaeda have seized on the controversy "with glee." On radical Web forums, he said, the dispute over the Islamic center, which would include space for worship, is lumped together with fringe developments like a Florida pastor's call for making Sept. 11 "Burn a Koran Day."
"It's seen as proof of what Awlaki and others have been saying, that the U.S. is hypocritical and that most Americans are enemies of Islam," Mr. Kohlmann said. He called the anti-Islam statements spawned by the dispute "disturbing and sad" and said they were feeding anti-American sentiment that could provoke violence.
Meanwhile, we have soldiers abroad whose lives depend on winning the "hearts and minds" of the Afghan people. Why do Cordoba opponents hate the troops so?

David Bromwich: Cordoba House and Religious Freedom
It has been said that liberty is a political good that's easier to win than to maintain; easier to unlearn than to learn. To judge by events of the last three months, we have gone a long way toward unlearning the habits of religious freedom.	Jack Miles: Quran-Burning and Republican Electoral Strategy: A Postscript from Australia
The ugly, Islamophobic picture of the United States that Americans have been gazing at over the past two weeks or so has had a Republican more than a Democratic frame. American voters, come November, may recoil from it.	Grant Brooke, M.Div.: Hindsight: Burying the Ghost of Ground Zero
Until we rebuild the World Trade Center and properly memorialize the the victims of 9/11, the tragedies of that day will continue to linger on through irrational, unfettered, inconvenient, and hateful ruptures of the past into the present.	Mira Schor: My Whole Street Is a Mosque
Several times a day, small groups of Muslims pull out prayers mats, kneel towards the East and pray, 14 blocks from Ground Zero, on ground they've spontaneously "hallowed."	Brad Hirschfield: The N.Y. Islamic Center Controversy: How People of the Same Faith Can Disagree
The Gallup numbers suggest that there is greater diversity of opinion than is often presumed and clearly demonstrate that no one view, even with any given faith community, holds sway. Mark R. Cohen: The Meaning of 'Cordoba': Can It Really Symbolize Religious Tolerance?
Can Córdoba serve as a symbol for tolerance and mutual understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims today? Yes. Eboo Patel: America's Promise Is Meant For Everyone
One day, I promise you, we will be as ashamed of the way American Muslims are viewed and treated in 2010 as we are of Japanese internment and Jim Crow. America's promise is meant for everyone or we are not America. Jason Derr: Beyond the Scapegoating of Islam: Returning to the American Dream
Whether it is the Koran-burning pastor or the Park51/Cordoba House protests, the anti-Muslim rhetoric has bordered on evil and has been squarely in the realm of anti-constitutional and anti-American.	Most Popular
