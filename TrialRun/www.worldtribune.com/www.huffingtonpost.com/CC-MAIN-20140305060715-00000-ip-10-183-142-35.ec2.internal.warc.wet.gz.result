NEW YORK -- Macy's Inc. says it will open all of its namesake stores at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving for the first time. It becomes the latest retailer to extend hours on Black Friday, the traditional kickoff to the holiday season.
More than 800 Macy's stores will stay open for 23 hours and close at 11 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 25. That compares with last year when Macy's opened eight stores at midnight while the rest opened at 4 a.m.
Martine Reardon, Macy's executive vice president of marketing, said the midnight openings are a response to customers' requests.
"People want to shop through the night," Reardon said.
In recent years, retailers have expanded their Black Friday hours and rolled out sales for the day weeks in advance. That's in contrast to a few years ago when stores kept their discounts and hours secret until a few days before the Thanksgiving weekend. Retailers are responding to shoppers who like to map out their bargain-hunting strategies early.
Last year, Sears and Kmart stores opened Thanksgiving morning for the first time. Toys R Us stores opened at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Many Gap Inc. stores also were open. And Wal-Mart opened most of its stores by midnight that evening.
Target Corp. became one of the first retailers to announce its Black Friday hours this year. The discounter said on Friday that it would open its doors at midnight for the first time ever and offer Black Friday specials at that time. Like Macy's, it plans to stay open 23 hours. More merchants are expected to announce their hours and deals for the Thanksgiving weekend in the next week or so.

'Sins & Secrets': Teen Plots With Sister, Mother, Friends To Kill His Father For Sleeping With His Girlfriend
The shocking story of a father who was murdered by his own children in Omaha, Nebraska was explored on the latest "Sins & Secrets." Through reenactments, the show told the horrible story of the Carson family and the Elkhorn Eight. Ultimately, eight people were charged with involvement in the beating death of Brian Carson.
Brian's teenage son Ryan plotted with his sister and mother -- as well as friends -- to kill his father. Brian had begun a romantic relationship with Ryan's girlfriend and was living with her. Authorities believed this to be Ryan's motive for patricide.
According to the show, Ryan's mother agreed to let the kids use her house to kill her husband -- as long as they didn’t make a mess. Ryan and his friends beat Brian to death with a fire poker, a pipe wrench and a shovel, then put the body in a trunk. In the end, everyone pleaded guilty to their involvement in Carson's death, and received sentences ranging up to 80 years in prison. Ryan's mother Teresa was sentenced to 18-20 years.
See more shocking true crime stories every Sunday on "Sins & Secrets" at 9 p.m. ET on ID.

Peggy Olson, "Mad Men"She didn't have an easy start as a secretary at Sterling Cooper, but Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) has certainly worked her way up on the '60s era drama. Peggy was consdiered one of the biggest creative geniuses behind the company (before she left last season), although she certainly lost a few nights of sleep in the process. Walter White, "Breaking Bad"Once just a high school chemistry teacher, Walt (Bryan Cranston) has spent the past four years battling cancer, cooking meth and killing people. Oh, and he's now considered the drug king of New Mexico. It's kind of a tough job.Deborah Morgan, "Dexter"Deb (Jennifer Carpenter) is totally devoted to her job as a Lieutenant for the the Miami Metro Homicide Unit. In a mostly male-dominated field, she had to prove herself by outworking everyone else. She takes her job home with her, has no personal life to speak of, and has been rewarded for her dedication and police intuition with promotions to Detective and eventually Lieutenant for simultaneously busting asses and kicking them.Saul Berenson, "Homeland"There were heartbreaking moments and tense developments galore in this crackling Showtime thriller, but anchoring it all was a wonderfully soulful performance by Mandy Patinkin as the hard-working Saul. He talked Carrie down from her more manic places, and when that failed, he comforted her at her lowest moments -- all in addition to holding down a demanding job as a crucial CIA employee. One of the most indelible images of Season 1 was a scene of Saul using a ruler to spread peanut butter on some crackers, a late-night snack that reinforced the idea that those who often work hard to keep America safe not only don't get credit -- they don't even get dinner. Leslie Knope, "Parks & Recreation"You will not find a harder worker in the Parks and Recreation department of Pawnee. Heck, you probably won't find a more dedicated worker anywhere on TV. Leslie (Amy Poehler) spearheaded the Harvest Festival, saving Pawnee. She also tirelessly campaigned for a seat on the Pawnee City Council while continuing her work with the Parks Department. When she was suspended, she started her own citizen action league. You can take the Knope out of the office, but you can't take the work out of the Knope.
Tyrion Lannister, "Game of Thrones"Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) wasn't exactly a hard-working guy when "Thrones" began, but over the course of two seasons, more and more responsibilities piled up on him, to the point where he hardly had time for bordellos and wine (the horror!). One of the most fascinating things about the HBO show is the way it's shown Tyrion -- who'd been underestimated and mostly dismissed by everyone (including himself) -- realize that he not only was good at wielding power, he actually liked it. But it certainly cuts into a guy's recreational time, as courtiers Varys and Littlefinger could have told him. Alicia Florrick, "The Good Wife"Is Alicia (Julianna Margulies) ever home? And when she's home, is her phone ever not within arm's reach? She always goes above and beyond for Lockhart/Gardner. This is her first job in years and Alicia has moved fast, climbing the corporate ladder with ease. Could it be Lockhart, Gardner & Florrick soon?John Cooper, "Southland"Cooper (Michael Cudlitz) is recovering from addiction problems, but he never lets his bad back stand in the way of doing his job as an LAPD officer. His troubled past (a criminal father, a failed marriage and his closeted sexuality) explains why he's so passionate about the job, and why he does it all with a sense of humor. "You're a cop because you don't know how not to be one. If you feel that way, you're a cop -- if you don't, you're not."Kate Beckett, "Castle"Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) has a lot on her plate -- the unsolved murder of her mother that drew her to the job and Castle, the man who wants to help her solve the case ... but not at the expense of her own safety. Her personal issues sometimes drive her to make emotional decisions in the field, but it just proves how much she really cares.Sam and Dean Winchester, "Supernatural"Plenty of people take their work home with them, but few let their jobs consume them as thoroughly as hunky, demon-hunting brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) have over seven seasons of "Supernatural." The family business of "saving people" and "hunting things" not only has them living in motels and out of Dean's trusty Impala, it's also seen them sent to Heaven, Hell and many dimensions in-between in the name of saving the world. If anyone deserves a vacation, it's these two hard-working heroes. Sadly for them, kicking ass and looking good is a full-time job.Miranda Bailey, "Grey's Anatomy"Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson) could not be more dedicated to her job at Seattle Grace. When viewers first met her, she was the play-by-the rules resident of general surgery and referred to as "The Nazi" by her five surgical interns -- Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) -- because she ruled with an iron first. But Bailey has since proven to have a soft heart, too. Her devotion to her job arguably cost her her marriage, but Bailey could never turn her back on the co-workers and patients at Seattle Grace, no matter how much stress and pressure she's under.Kenneth Parcell, "30 Rock"The constantly-cheerful NBC page (and former Southern farm boy) is one of the most dutiful employees we've ever seen on TV. Sure, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) is incredibly awkward and sometimes annoyingly optimistic, but he also could not be more devoted to "TGS," NBC and television at large. After all, how many times have we seen him out of his page uniform? Max Black, "Two Broke Girls"One of the titular heroines of CBS' raunchy comedy, Max Black (Kat Dennings) seems to have tried her hand at just about every low-paying job in New York. She's also an excellent multitasker, balancing her burgeoning cupcake business with waitressing, nannying, cleaning, working as a department store Christmas elf, dog-sitting and wrangling her flaky roommate Caroline, to name a few. Someone give this poor broke girl a break! Antoine Batiste, "Treme"It's not easy being a working musician in New Orleans. Whether he's trying to wrangle together his own band or lugging his trombone all around town going from gig to gig, Antoine Batiste (Wendell Pierce) is always hustling. At his wife's urging, he picked up a side job as an assistant band leader at a local high school, which will give his family a steady stream of secondary income.

Sports News
By Ryan Lavner, Golf Channel
Rory McIlroy may have just completed one of the best seasons of the past decade, but it wasn't as lucrative as some believe.
The Northern Irishman’s victory Sunday at the DP World Tour Championship pushed his official tournament earnings on the 2012 European Tour to €4,738,026.
When the Race to Dubai was initiated in 2009, however, the European Tour began factoring in money from that bonus pool into players’ earnings, so the tour recognizes McIlroy as having earned a single-season record €5,519,117 -- a little more than $7 million (the PGA Tour does not lump FedExCup bonus money in its money tallies). Fair enough.
But when he stormed back to win in Dubai on Sunday, it was reported that McIlroy had earned a combined $11.9 million to become the all-time leading single-season money earner after combining both PGA and European tour earnings.
Not quite true.
For a fair comparison, FedExCup payouts would have to be included. As figures shown below from the Golf Channel Research Unit indicate, doing that would leave McIlroy more than $6 million shy of Tiger Woods' mark in 2007. Even if you take away the bonus money from both tours and focus only on tournament earnings, McIlroy's gross take-home pay on the two circuits still ranks only fifth all-time.
In fact, the world No. 1 also did not win the most money in a season on the world money list or even the most tournament prize money in a season on the European Tour (not counting bonus-pool money).

As you can imagine, when we throw a party, the cocktails can't just be decent. They need to be great. So we almost always serve a bowl of delicious punch. Not only does it look impressive, but it also means we don't need to stand behind the bar mixing and shaking all night long.
And one of our favorite recipes to make is the simple and refreshing Green Beast. The four-ingredient drink calls for absinthe, lime juice, simple syrup, water and a few cucumber slices. That's it. (And no, it won't make you hallucinate.)
Learn how to make this concoction by watching the short video below featuring talented bartender and Liquor.com advisory board member Simon Ford, who says it's his favorite absinthe cocktail. We think you'll agree. Cheers!
Click here for the full Green Beast recipe.

Paul Ryan Is a Charlatan, Not a Serious 'Policy Wonk'
Peter Dreier
E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental College	For too long, reporters have been bamboozled by Ryan, who claims to be a both a budget expert and something of a social philosopher. But he's just a slick talker who appears to have flunked basic math in high school or college, because his budget numbers never add up.

An Un-American Wolf in Religious Liberty's Clothing
Roger Fisk
Writer and Communications Consultant	What's funny, in a macabre way, is the effort to re-impose religion's will is dressed up as the next chapter in the same civil rights struggle that cleansed the public square of the zealot's self-proclaimed authority to begin with.
Comments (13) Federal Court: If You Buy a Girl, You're a Sex Trafficker
Kevin M. Ryan
President and CEO, Covenant House	A U.S. Federal Circuit Court has ruled that customers who arrange for or have sex with children under age 18 are to be considered human traffickers. Wow. That's a big and heavy stick we can use to protect kids who are forced into having sex for someone else's profit.
Comments The Pentagon's Phony Budget War
Mattea Kramer
Research director, National Priorities Project	Despite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.
Comments It Turns Out, Obamacare Actually Does Care
Robert J. Elisberg
Screenwriter and columnist	Even if a person doesn't qualify for an ACA health plan, you -- and by "you" I mean everyone -- still get the benefits of the new law. And much of this has very real, and very substantive financial savings -- just not the financial savings you read about in the news about monthly bills.
Comments Let's Fix a Justice System That Isn't Working
Harry Belafonte
Entertainer & Activist	There is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.
Comments (24) There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery
Sen. Bernie Sanders
Independent U.S. Senator from Vermont	The Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.
Comments (121) Understanding CBO's Minimum-Wage Report
Scott Lilly
Senior fellow, Center for American Progress	As the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.
Comments Why Being My Brother's Keeper Matters
Gov. Deval Patrick
Governor, Massachusetts	As a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.
Comments (14) The Afghan Ballet: Why Washington Doesn't Want to Leave Afghanistan
Tom Engelhardt
Editor, TomDispatch.com	Washington and Kabul have, for endless months, been performing a strange pas de deux over the issue of American withdrawal. The less Karzai complied, the more Obama administration and Pentagon officials betrayed an overwhelming need to stay.
Comments On a Random Day in the U.S. There Are More Than 66,000 Requests for Help Escaping Domestic Violence
Soraya Chemaly
Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that order	The dynamics of domestic violence are complex and changing them requires not just one thing to change, but many things simultaneously.
Comments Outing the Deep State
Robert Koehler
Syndicated writer	Can we actually build a world that isn't run by its shadow interests? And what is this going to take? Can good will and big principles stand up to Wall Street and the Washington consensus?
Comments Not a Big Fan of My Brother's Keeper
César Vargas
Producer, activist, and social media strategist	Poor people are under a great deal of stress. Their spirits are under a lot of stress. To tell them that they have no excuse is not just irresponsible. It's dangerous.
Comments President Obama, Say 'No' to Keystone XL Pipeline
Alan Robock
Distinguished Professor of Climatology, Rutgers University; director, Rutgers Undergraduate Meteorology Program	Wouldn't it make much more sense to hire people to construct wind turbines, install solar panels, and build the new electric grid we need? Wouldn't it make more sense to invest in battery technology and the other developments we will need for a fossil-free future?
Comments Why Retirement Security for Women Is Not an Option
Dedrick Muhammad
Senior Director of Economic Programs, NAACP	March marks Women's History Month -- a time for celebrating women's historic gains and achievements. But, equally important, especially in this sluggish economic recovery, is amplifying the contemporary economic challenges women continue to face, including the uphill climb to retirement security.
Comments Michele Bachmann Didn't Care for Religious Tolerance Until AZ Law
Cathy Reisenwitz
DC-based writer and political commentator	What seems to upset Bachmann is that America is waking up to the fact that a culture which used to dominate, the one where it's cool to discriminate against gays and pretend the Jim Crow south was fun and make racist jokes is losing ground.
Comments Momentum Builds in Puerto Rico for Major Marijuana Reforms
Adrian Brito
Law Student, Writer	If this happens, Puerto Rico will become the first American territory to legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize marijuana possession.
Comments Why All LGBT People Should Care About Places Like Russia, Uganda and Gambia
Kevin Jennings
Executive Director, Arcus Foundation	As barriers to legal equality seem to be falling like dominoes in the United States, it's easy for LGBT Americans and their allies to feel a sense of giddiness. But even as the momentum in the U.S. seems to be accelerating in the right direction, a disturbing countertrend has emerged.
Comments Crimea: The End Game
Joe Peyronnin
Hofstra Journalism Professor	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Benghazi, nor is it the result of a weak American president. Now the question is will Putin really want to take the off ramp or deescalate tensions? Or might he be inclined to play this chess match out in a different way?

This question originally appeared on Quora. By an anonymous user of Quora
I have been single in Palo Alto for the last 2 years. For me, being single in SV is frustrating. I realize guys think single girls in SV have it made in the shade, but I (and quite a few of my girlfriends) really haven't found it to be so. The main issues that I have noticed are: High male: female ratio. Yes, this is a problem. When there are more women around and a guy seems interested in me and asks me out, I can usually assume that he is interested in me for more reasons than simply my gender. For whatever reason, he feels chemistry toward me beyond what he normally feels, and he wants to explore that further. Unfortunately, because of the high percentage of men, I have found that a guy behaving like he is interested is really no indication of if he is genuinely interested. I think in most cases the guy isn't even aware this is happening. He is just casting his net and if an attractive girl shows up in it, he is going to go for it, at least in the short term. The dating scene is just so under supplied with women that for a lot of guys, a girl showing interest in him is enough for him to be interested. In the long term however, after a few weeks/months it turns out that the guy really isn't all that interested. No one wants to be a consolation prize, but with so few women in SV, even if a guy acts like he is interested, how do you know you are his top choice? How do you know when there is sincere chemistry on his side? Another consequence of this is that it seems like the really quality guys just don't even bother asking girls out because they don't want to be lumped in with the guys that will ask anything with a skirt out. There is definitely a certain type of guy in SV that just goes around asking girls out right and left, I wouldn't want to be associated with that guy either...So you get a lot of these 'semi-desperate' (sorry) guys hitting on you, but the quality guys are sitting back and not making any moves.Little casual dating. Because of the lack of women, or because the guys here are really busy, there really isn't much of a casual dating scene. You get asked to 'grab coffee or a drink' but that isn't really dating. As another answerer pointed out it is often unclear in those situations if it is even a date or not. Actual dating just isn't very common in SV. Everyone is so busy working and stressing that there just isn't much importance put on dating for fun. Whatever the reason, when a date actually does occur (again this is rare, in favor of very informal coffee meet ups etc.) it feels less casual than in other places. Probably because it just isn't very common to go on a 'real' date here. Everyone is really stressed out and working a lot. Really similar to the previous point but a little different. I just feel like there is a lot of talk and complaining about the lack of women, but when it comes right down to it, a lot of the guys around here aren't leaving much time to meet girls. They would make time for a relationship if the perfect girl fell into their lap, but they aren't going to make time to do much active looking or dating. Very high expectations. Everyone has really high expectations around here. Everyone is looking for the 10x girlfriend. Um, this is hard to live up to. I don't look like Gisele, have an IQ of 140 and play WoW or code for fun in my spare time (when I'm not cooking elaborate gourmet dinners) and I haven't founded any companies. Small community. No one wants to be the girl that everyone and his co-founder have dated. But it is a small community, and after a couple of dates with a couple of guys at different start-ups it could start to feel that way. So then there is even more pressure to pick dates wisely. (So I'm sort of making this one up, I've thought about it, but don't have any real experience or examples of this happening, does this happen?)Stigma to being single. There is definitely a stigma attached to being a single female for too long in SV. No one would think twice about a guy being single for a few years, but with a girl the first thought/question automatically is 'so what is wrong with her?'Bitterness/resentment from SV guys. This is a small point and doesn't really happen too much. However I have experienced resentment from SV men directed at me for simply being female and single. Like I somehow owe the men of SV my services as a female because we are in short supply. I don't really pay attention to this sort of thing, but it is a little annoying. Note: I'm fairly shy. For an extroverted girl who really likes a lot of male attention and dating, the first point doesn't really hold. I actually do know a few women who love dating in SV and feel like they hit the jackpot. For a girl who is more shy though and doesn't like getting flooded by a bunch of guys who wouldn't look at her twice if there were 20 other women in the room, this can be overwhelming and unpleasant. I would much rather have one (or zero!) guys hit on me that seriously feel real chemistry, than 20 who are just excited to be talking to a girl.

Left to their own devices, most Americans would turn gay. At least that is the impression one gets from the current anti-gay campaign waged by some social conservatives and the religious right. Anxiety about the spread of homosexuality and the propagation of a "gay agenda" is at the root of claims that gays want to "recruit" children. It also fuels the opposition to education about homosexuality in public schools, as evidenced by the recent passage of the "Don't Say Gay" bill in the Tennessee Senate. This anxiety undergirds the approaches of such Ex-Gay ministries as "Exodus International," and may have even played a role in the recently overturned military policy, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." For a sexual disposition that is supposedly the divinely sanctioned "natural order," heterosexuality appears curiously vulnerable.
At the same time, social conservatives and the religious right characterize the "gay lifestyle" as a sad and terrible "choice." That is essentially the point GOP frontrunner, Michele Bachman made in 2004.
"It is a very sad life. It's a part of Satan, I think, to say that it's 'gay.' It's anything but 'gay.' It leads to the personal enslavement of individuals. Because if you're involved in the gay and lesbian lifestyle, it's bondage. It is personal bondage, personal despair, and personal enslavement, and that is why this is so dangerous."
For Bachmann and many others, to be gay is to live a life of sadness, despair, and enslavement, but we need political activism of the most stalwart kind to keep many Americans, particularly our young, from embracing this path or rising up in support of it.
This faulty logic is intrinsic to the homophobia that persists in American society. Sound logic is never a matter of concern when fear is the primary motivating factor. The reasoning for one's opposition to something they fear does not have to make logical sense. The faulty logic also reveals a perennial misunderstanding of the nature of sexuality. If homosexuality is a matter of "choice," then so is heterosexuality. But no one who opposes homosexuality on the basis of "choice" ever makes the claim that they themselves are choosing to be heterosexual. No, they just are. But if one can just be heterosexual, it follows that one can just be homosexual. More troubling, however, is the anti-democratic sentiment at the core of this faulty logic. Characterizing homosexuality as a "choice" minoritizes gay Americans, rendering them outside Constitutional protections. In other words, to be gay is to somehow be "un-American." This concern set the tone for former New Jersey governor, James McGreevy's resignation speech in 2004. "And so my truth is," he proclaimed, "I am a gay American." The "choice" argument also renders gay people outside the realm of religion and morality. Since our political discourse on (and against) homosexuality always slips into religious discourse, gays are seen in opposition to religion and morality. Indeed, some politicians and lawmakers have invoked the language of "sin" in their opposition to gay Americans. But the discourse of "sin," has no place in the political culture of a liberal democracy. Such discourse lends support to the historical fiction of America as a "Christian nation," and limits morality as the special province of the religious and Christians in particular.
Invoking the discourse of "sin" with regard to gay Americans grows from fear and disquiet about perceived "gay behavior." Most opposition to homosexuality initially begins by underscoring issues of sexual identity, but always lapses into matters of sexual behavior that re-inscribe the "rightness" of heterosexuality. However, moralistic pronouncements about identity or sexual behavior are both inconsistent with our system of government. It has been deemed unconstitutional and morally irresponsible to discriminate against someone based on their identity. It is just as wrong to do so based on the perception of what law-abiding private citizens do in their bedrooms. But even pro-gay forces falter in their efforts to promote sexual equality, often inadvertently re-inscribing "heteronormativity." Lady Gaga did so in her latest hit, "Born this Way." The song is an anthem to refute the "choice" argument, claiming instead for the naturalness of homosexuality. If being gay is not a choice but an immutable quality in a person like skin color, height, or gender, then gays have a right to equal treatment by the rest of society. Not only does this framework render gay Americans apart from rather than a part of society, it also ironically reaffirms the naturalness of heterosexuality. Born "this way" emphatically implies difference from the norm.
As we saw with the Civil Rights Movement, however, arguments based on nature and immutable qualities never work. In a democratic society, rights should not be granted on the basis of sameness, but despite differences. Blacks were granted legal equality based on the principles of freedom and our standing as citizens. So the real question is, on what basis can gays be granted full equality in the U.S. and on what basis can that freedom be denied?
Following the lead of Janet Jacobsen and Ann Pellegrini, I maintain that sexual freedom is analogous to religious freedom. We should no more allow discrimination against gay Americans than we would American Catholics, Baptists, or Mormons. If persons who choose to be religious live under the full Constitutional protection of our government, why can't homosexuals be granted the same freedom?
Religious opposition to homosexuality is often a statement on the part of our churches about who really is an American and deserves the protection of the State. But the reality is that as Americans we all are free, and all religious institutions are Constitutionally bound to honor this. And as a segment of society that benefits from one of the most hallowed principles of our government, the freedom of religion, they should be happy to do so.
A truly democratic society respects human persons, as well as the choices they make as law abiding, private citizens.

We've failed to recognize the destruction heteronormative ideals have wreaked in the gay community. Aas a result, they've blown apart untold numbers of our relationships, broken far too many hearts, and created an army of cynical, single gay men. Wayne Besen: 'Ex-Gay' Activist's Stunning Admission
It is never easy for one to acknowledge being wrong. I wish John Smid the best of luck on his continued evolution and am grateful that he is beginning to honestly discuss the limitations of "ex-gay" programs. Sylvia Rhue, Ph.D.: Can the Religious Right Handle the Truth?
What the religious right fights against is people realizing that the state of being LGBT is a normal, morally neutral variation of human development. This is a truth that the anti-gay religio-political complex has found does not serve them. Around the Web:
