On last night's episode of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" Kim Kardashian is concerned when a rash develops on her legs just before she's set to shoot a commercial. After all, how is she supposed to walk down the aisle with blotchy, scaly skin? So Kardashian heads to the dermatologist--after her sister Khloe tells her it's ringworm--where her doctor diagnoses her with psoriasis, a hereditary skin condition that her mother, Kris Jenner, has as well.
"I'd heard of it before because my mom has always had it, but she didn't have red flaky dots all over her," Kardashian, 30, told Life and Style Weekly, regarding the skin condition. When her dermatologist tells her lifestyle, stress, travel and food are among the things that can exacerbate the problem, Kim worries about the impact it will have on her career. And not to mention, planning a wedding in less than three months can be pretty stressful. "When I gain a pound, it's in the headlines, so imagine what the tabloids will do to me when they see all these spots," the magazine quoted her as saying.
But Kardashian isn't the only celeb with the flaky skin condition. LeAnn Rimes has been very public about her battle with psoriasis. "What Not to Wear" host Stacy London has also admitted to suffering from psoriasis, using humor to hide her discomfort. However, the biggest psoriasis success story is that of "America's Next Top Model Winner," CariDee English. During her worst outbreak, seventy percent of her body was covered in red plaques. Luckily for Kardashian and the millions of Americans suffering from the condition, psoriasis can be treatable and manageable with treatments ranging from creams to pills to skin injections.

VENICE, Italy — Israeli director Rama Burshtein provides an intimate look inside the private world of Tel Aviv's Hasidic community in the film `'Fill the Void," which premiered this weekend in competition at the Venice Film Festival.
A Hasidic Jew herself, Burshtein said she wanted to create a portrait of family life within the community without presenting it in conflict with the secular world.
`'The Orthodox world is so interesting it does not need to cope with the secular," Burshtein told a news conference Sunday. "It can be very interesting and the drama can be very strong inside."
The film is about an 18-year-old girl named Shira who struggles with whether she wants to marry her brother-in-law, Yochay, after her sister Esther dies giving birth. The decision is all Shira's, despite the strict formality within the community, and the movie ultimately is a story about facing a difficult decision and becoming a woman.
`'It's all about emotions and choices and what leads you to do what you do," said actress Hadas Yaron, who played Shira. `'I'm also young. But Shira is different from me because she is not familiar with all these feelings she experiences for the first time."
The movie shows intimate rituals of the Hasidic community, from Esther's funeral to her infant son's circumcision ceremony immediately after, Sabbath dinner and the workings of the matchmaker, who helps broker marriages as girls reach Shira's age.
The community, while residing inside the bustling and secular city of Tel Aviv, is very self-contained. In one scene, as the men study, someone gets up to close the windows that allow sounds of secular Tel Aviv to drift inside.
`'This moment in the movie really gives the idea of being in the environment," said Yiftach Klein, who plays the brother-in-law Yochay.
Burshein, 45, was born in New York and graduated from film school in Jerusalem in 1994. During that period, she became deeply religious. She has since been making films within the Orthodox community to help promote self-expression.
`'I love this world. I chose this world. I was not born to this world," she said.
She said, however, that the Hasidic world did not appear inviting when she first contemplated it from the outside 20 years ago.
`'Part of that was because how I thought they saw women," she said. Once inside, however, she said she found she liked traditional roles between men and women.
`'I love my role as a woman. I feel it is true. I chose it. It doesn't stop me from doing films, but the way I see the home, between a man and a woman, I love it like this. It is more sexy."

Politics News
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich sat down with Sam Stein and Marc Lamont Hill at HuffPost Live Wednesday to talk gun control days after the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The former presidential hopeful said he agreed with Virginia governor Bob McDonnell that arming teachers might be a solution to the problem of school shootings saying "school administrators should be trained and should have arms that are available under lock and key."
"If that principal who lost her life had been able to step in the door and kill him," Gingrich continued, "we would have saved a tremendous number of lives."
Gingrich dismissed immediate calls for new gun legislation, however.
"More gun control might be good PR, it might make people feel better," he said, but he later pointed out that even in states with strong laws, "there are thousands of people killed annually by criminals who apparently don't pay attention to gun control."

Honeymoons... On The Moon?In his 1995 book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jK8fAQAAMAAJ&q=newt+gingrich+to+renew+america&dq=newt+gingrich+to+renew+america&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z6whT_aUDMLc0QG7p8mACQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA" target="_hplink"><em>To Renew America</em></a>, Gingrich wrote, "Honeymoons in space will be the vogue by 2020. ... Imagine looking out at the Earth from your honeymoon suite and you will understand even more why it will be a big item." Sex In SpaceGingrich also explained the appeal of sex in space in <em>To Renew America</em>. "Imagine weightlessness and its effects and you will understand some of the attractions," he wrote. Stellar StatehoodIn a 1981 bill, Gingrich <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/newt-gingrichs-laws-for-governing-a-space-colony" target="_hplink">proposed</a> a path to statehood for a future space-based colony. The bill, which Gingrich called the "Northwest Ordinance for Space," would require a space outpost to have 20,000 residents in order to apply for statehood. "The Congress declares that the United States is committed to the expansion of free people and free institutions into space," reads the bill. Later, the bill briefly discusses the logistics of space statehood, saying that space colonies with enough residents will "establish a constitution and government for themselves." Farming In Space While giving <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/newt-gingrichs-big-1986-idea-farmers-in-space" target="_hplink">a speech</a> to the World Science Fiction Convention in 1986, the longtime sci-fi fan described the outer space agricultural hub that could have been. "If we'd spent as much on space as we've spent on farm programs, we could have taken all the extra farmers and put them on space stations working for a living ... in orbiting factories," Gingrich said. Star WarsIn a 2002 <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/missile/interviews/gingrich.html#ixzz1fOvQH8Pv" target="_hplink">interview</a> with PBS' "Frontline," Gingrich predicted that within a decade, the United States would be able to deflect a missile attack from North Korea or Iran by using "directed energy weapons and laser pulsing systems ... that could actually do that from space." Light Highways And Fight Crime With Space MirrorsIn his 1984 book <em>Window of Opportunity</em>, Gingrich <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/12/david-brooks/david-brooks-says-newt-gingrich-once-proposed-putt/" target="_hplink">outlined</a> how building mirrors in space would save electricity and help fight crime.
"A mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways," he wrote. "Ambient light covering entire areas could reduce the current danger of criminals lurking in the darkness." Contract With SpaceIn 2010, Gingrich <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/a/feb10/gingrich/?promo_code=0" target="_hplink">revived</a> the Contract With America, his famed call-to-action that helped bring a Republican majority to Congress in 1994. His "New Contract With America" was published in <em>Newsmax</em>.
Gingrich's fellow conservatives were so inspired by his 21st-century version that one, columnist Matt Lewis, added to the former speaker's plan. One of the points in <a href="http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/01/25/republican-contract-with-america-version-2-0/" target="_hplink">Lewis' plan</a> was the "Science and Final Frontiers Act," which outlined the goal of putting an American on Mars by 2019.
