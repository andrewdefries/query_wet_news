Has Kourtney Kardashian caught wedding fever? According to the Oct. 31 issue of OK! USA, Kardashian and longtime boyfriend Scott Disick are jumping on the wedding wagon, after nearly five years of being together.
The couple has made headlines for their tumultuous relationship over the years. But the magazine claims that all of this changed when their son, Mason, was born in 2009: "[Scott] has really turned his life around and been amazing," Kourtney's mother Kris Jenner told the magazine. But is the report true? Kourtney has made it clear in the past that she is hesitant about the "M word." (When asked about wedding rumors in August by a Huffington Post reporter, Kourtney Kardashian responded, "Not right now. No time soon.")
Despite their history, OK! USA reports that a friend said, "The idea has really grown on [Kourtney] ... They have talked it to death and she said if it's what Scott really wants, then she wants it too."
That's all well and good, but we want to know: will there be a television special for this wedding too?

This week marked the opening of the new Supreme Court term, with John Roberts at the helm, the conservative majority champing at the bit, and the newest justice, Elena Kagan, taking her seat for the first time. It also is the occasion of the release of Alliance for Justice's new short film, Crude Justice, which exposes the terrible dilemma facing hard-pressed victims of the Gulf oil spill as they are forced to choose between suing BP in court and taking a payment from the company's $20 billion compensation fund.
It's easy at the beginning of any Supreme Court term to get caught up in all the pomp and circumstance and the esoteric legal issues that will be argued in the Court's hushed chamber. It's harder sometimes to remember that the cases the Court takes involve real people whose lives, livelihoods, and freedoms are at stake.
But it's not so hard this year, because the voices and stories of the struggling people of the Gulf we interviewed for Crude Justice are an unequivocal reminder of what's at stake in our courts.
Our film shows that there are no simple, completely satisfying answers to the legal conundrums in the Gulf. Despite BP's heavily (and expensively) advertised promise to "make this right," the reality is that the BP spill wrecked the lives of tens of thousands of people and it's impossible to put everything back the way it was before. BP, with all its resources, and its ability to make money hand over fist, can come back, but a small-businesswoman or an oysterman who has lost a year's worth of customers and income cannot. What makes the situation even more troubling and uncertain, both legally and personally, is that no one knows how long the environmental and economic effects of five million barrels of oil will last. Will the fisheries and tourists come back, and if so, how soon?
As Crude Justice explains, there are two basic paths toward just and fair compensation. On the one hand, a victim can take BP's offer of short-term help for current losses and then, later, a final payment, one condition of which is that he or she forgoes the right to sue BP in the future. On the other, victims have the right to pursue their claims through the courts, which have the advantage of having rules and procedures that theoretically should level the playing field, but which have the disadvantage of being in a region well stocked with judges that are thoroughly embedded in an oil culture. The route through the courts also takes plaintiffs on a path that leads ultimately to a strongly pro-corporate Supreme Court.
And that's where the release of Crude Justice and the opening of the Supreme Court term come together.
Professor Oliver Houck from the Tulane Law School appears in the film and declares, "Valdez hangs over this BP blowout like a cloud." What he's referring to, of course, is not just the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1987, but the subsequent court case that went all the way to the Supreme Court, where John Roberts and his conservative allies, after almost 20 years of litigation, gave Exxon a big gift by slashing the Alaska trial jury's punitive damages award by 90 percent. The 32,000 plaintiffs in that case, many of whom had died in the two decades it took to resolve, learned first hand about the nature of the current Corporate Court and its willingness to ensure that nothing will stand in the way of corporate interests or profit, not even the suffering of people whose lives have been wrecked and who have waited two decades for some measure of justice.
The decision in the Exxon case demonstrates that Supreme Court decisions are not abstract intellectual exercises. And now, in 2010, the effects of that case are still reverberating, touching the lives of thousands of people in the Gulf who have never been to Alaska, but whose ability to collect punitive damages has been crippled by an ideological Court with a clear agenda.
The film is both heartbreaking and hopeful as we chronicle the fight for justice and the struggle of the hard-working people of the Gulf to make their lives whole again. The people we interviewed told us over and over again that they are afraid they'll be forgotten as the crisis recedes in the public mind. They also told us they will never give up their fight. We made Crude Justice to ensure that their stories are told and to hold both BP and the legal system accountable for what comes next. View the 17-minute film below, or at www.crudejustice.org.

'Green News Report' - March 6, 2014
Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen
Co-hosts of the radio's nationally syndicated 'Green News Report'
The Green News Report is also available via...
...
Comments Flashback to 2008: When Russia Invaded and Fox News Shrugged
Eric Boehlert
Senior Fellow, Media Matters for America
At the time, the Bush White House sounded an awful lot like today's Obama White House. Yet unlike today, the Putin-led excursion in 2008 completely failed to spark the panicked rhetoric that's become Fox News' trademark since Russian troops crossed over into Ukraine last week.
Comments Oh, Really, Bill? Once Again, O'Reilly Can't Admit a Mistake
Mark Potok
Senior Fellow, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)
I went through a remarkably similar exercise with O'Reilly back in early 2011, after he completely mischaracterized something I said that apparently contradicted his worldview.
Comments Growing Up Liberal
Bob Burnett
Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executive
I thought about my path to liberalism when I read the recent interview between President Obama and Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly mouthed the classic conservative trope: liberals love the "nanny state" and think big government can solve all of America's problems.

ReThink Review: RoboCop (2014) -- A Drone By Any Other Name
Jonathan Kim
Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising Show
With a film so beloved, I guess it's inevitable that there would be a remake. But instead of being a toothless, needless, sanitized imitation, I'm happy to report that the new RoboCop is willing to make significant changes and swing even harder at its political commentary.
Comments BOTH SIDES NOW: Matalin-Reagan Debate if Christie and O'Reilly Should Be Flagged for Unnecessary Roughness?
HuffPost Radio
Has Christie crossed a line that's presidentially disqualifying and O'Reilly misused a sporting event to peddle crackpot conspiracies? And if conservatives like choice for markets and schools, why not for balancing health care, work and family?
Comments 10 More Questions Bill O'Reilly Might've Asked the President
Bob Cesca
Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob & Chez Show
Considering how Bill O'Reilly merely pandered to the delusional obsessions of his viewers rather than using his time to ask questions of actual substance, I thought I'd suggest some additional questions O'Reilly could've asked the president -- I mean, as long as he's asking stupid questions anyway.

Dear Bill O'Reilly: Please Interrupt Barack Obama
Jack Mirkinson
Senior Media Editor, The Huffington Post
Back in 2011, Bill O'Reilly interviewed President Obama before the Super Bowl. After the interview was over, the thing most people seemed to be talkin...

Does Bill Maher Still Think America Should Emulate the NFL?
Jim Treacy
Former President and Chief Operating Officer of Monster Worldwide
With Super Bowl XLVIII fast approaching and the wealth concentration issue more on people's hearts and minds than it was three years ago, I wonder if upon reflection Bill Maher still advocates the "NFL brand of socialism" for America?
Comments The Non-Christians' Favorite Bible Verse
Rick McDaniel
Author, 'Comeback: Overcoming The Setbacks In Your Life'
The recent Phil Robertson Duck Dynasty controversy brought it up again. Bill O'Reilly quoted it on Fox News; Don Lemon quoted it on CNN. The favorite...
Comments Why Fox News Lost Interest in Chicago Murders (Hint: Crime Rate Is Way Down)
Eric Boehlert
Senior Fellow, Media Matters for America
For years, Obama's critics have wanted to use Chicago as the centerpiece for a debate about guns and crime in America. With its crime and murder rate down dramatically, do O'Reilly, Drudge and Malkin still want to have that debate? Their silence suggests the answer is no.
Comments The Imaginary War on Christmas
Lincoln Mitchell
lincolnmitchell.com
The War on Christmas story reflects the discomfort that many socially conservative media figures, and presumably at least some of their followers, feel with an increasingly diverse country where people are no longer afraid to express their views.

Bill O'Reilly's War on Jesus
Robert Scheer
Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, 'The Great American Stickup'
What would Jesus do about the profound inequality of opportunity that both the pope and our president have identified as the most pressing moral crisis of our time? It is a timely question to ponder when many of us honor the purported moment of Christ's birth with a last-minute burst of shopping.

Let's Move Christmas to February!
Clay Farris Naff
Science and religion writer; Journalist; Author
The new Christmas will overshadow the oh-so-sappy Valentine's Day and the all-too-awkward "Presidents Day." (Blend two birthdays and then shut down the mail? Is that any way to honor our most heroic leaders?)

Comments Hijacking the Mandela Legacy
Alan Singer
Social studies educator, Hofstra University
Fox News curmudgeon Bill O'Reilly is reported to have acknowledged that Mandela was a "great man," but at the same time dismissed him because "he was a communist." I think O'Reilly, as usual, had it wrong

I've worked in the NYC nightlife and burlesque communities for over four years and, as of 2013, I began my career as a "porn star." The blurry line of sex worker and performance artist very much parallels the equally gray area of personal and professional grievances surrounding this issue.

When I went to Thailand to visit my best friend Leah, it was very important to me that we stop in Bangkok to see the Red Light District. Like many naïve young women, I found the sex industry wildly compelling. At 22 sex was rewarding and certain, while the rest of my life felt absurd.

This week, Taco Bell rolled out its long-awaited breakfast menu at 750 locations in 10 states across the country. The Tex-Mex titan of fast food, whose parent company is Yum! Brands Inc., spent the past five years developing the 11-item menu, known as "First Meal."
Slideshow: Reviewing Taco Bell's New 'First Meal' Breakfast Menu
Breakfast menus have a long and storied history in the American fast-food industry. In 1971, McDonald's introduced the first Egg McMuffin. In 1977, they officially unveiled their entire breakfast menu. Today, most McDonald's locations start serving breakfast around 6:00 a.m., and a host of other fast-food chains (Jack in the Box, Carl's Jr., Burger King, Wendy's, and even Starbucks and Subway) have been slow but sure to follow suit in delivering the "most important meal of the day." The one major fast-food chain to hold off on this trend, until now, has been Taco Bell, a seemingly natural addition to the breakfast bandwagon (Photo Credit: Andy Sweat).
Slideshow: Reviewing Taco Bell's New Cantina Bell Menu
But all you late-night "Fourth Meal"-ers won't have to wait any longer -- your "First Meal" has arrived (does that technically make it five meals a day?). The options include a Johnsonville Sausage and Egg Wrap, two larger burritos (the Grande Skillet costs $2.79 and the Steak and Egg costs $1.99), two smaller $0.99 burritos (Bacon and Egg, Sausage and Egg), a hash brown, a quartet of Cinnabon Delights (fried dough balls with cream filling), fresh-brewed Seattle's Best Coffee (hot, iced, and flavored); and Tropicana Orange Juice.
Slideshow: How to Order Mexican Without Sounding Estúpido
So what are early reviewers saying about Taco Bell's "First Meal" launch? In the following slideshow, three different types of avowed Los Angeles-based fast-food connoisseurs tested every item on the menu and gave their honest opinions.
Judge number one is what some would call a "fast-foodie," a connoisseur of all things drive-thru, the kind of person who would name their first child Mickey, and their second child Dee. Judge number two is the "breakfast-on-the-run" type, that friend of yours who's always apologizing for stray McMuffin wrappers when you get in their car. And judge number three is the "health nut," the health-conscious provider and parent who recognizes the time-saving benefits of fast food, but also knows the risks.
Nutritional facts are included with each item, but reviews were primarily limited to taste.
- Joshua Morrison, The Daily Meal

Fast-Foodie: "Nice crispiness to it. It’s almost got a panini type of feel to it. It seems like that’s the way with Taco Bell… everything’s very airy. The McDonald’s Sausage McMuffin comes to mind."
Breakfast-on-the-Run: "First thing, right off the bat, it’s half the size of their Crunch Wrap Supreme, which is like a Frisbee. Easy to carry. An easy in-your-car eat. Because it’s got a pocket, unlike a burrito which can squish out while you’re driving."
Health-Nut: "It’s very thin. You have a very thin layer of egg, not much cheese, and then you have a sausage patty. It’s not as hearty as other fast-food sandwiches."
