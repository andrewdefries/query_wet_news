The Republican presidential race actually begins Tuesday night. It is worth remembering that this is the first time we will hear from the voters—that everything up to this point, while presented as The Campaign, was actually a long, voter-less preseason consisting primarily of candidates, politicos, donors and reporters talking amongst themselves.
No one knows what these first voters will do. We do know that whatever they convey, however, it will depart significantly from The Campaign Narrative so far. The “front-runner” will definitely not be Herman Cain, for example, since he isn’t even running now that the real race is beginning. Last year’s conventional wisdom treated Cain like a huge contender—the press covered him more than any other candidate through all of November—while discounting “minor candidates” like Rick Santorum. Since the narrative and the hype have been such poor guides to this race, here are a couple points to help cut through the clutter when assessing the Iowa results.
The Expectations Game
Mitt Romney is expected to finish strong in Iowa: first or a close second. His advisers relentlessly played down expectations for the caucus, stressing that Romney did not campaign much on the ground. So if Romney wins, get ready to hear politicos and pundits proclaiming that he “beat expectations” and the race is basically over, given the momentum heading into New Hampshire.
Is that right? Well, Romney’s team has a point: It is hard to beat frontrunners that go on an early roll, and he did skip retail politicking in Iowa. Romney has done only thirty-three events in the state, while Ron Paul clocked over 100, and Santorum just did his 306th appearance.
It is absurd, however, to suggest that Romney is not campaigning hard to win Iowa. A pro-Romney PAC has spent about $4 million on ads there. More significantly, Romney’s own campaign leads the entire Republican field in direct contacts with likely caucus-goers: 31 percent say they have heard from the Romney campaign by phone or in-person, a notch above the 29 percent who have heard from Ron Paul’s famous machine, and double the 15 percent for Santorum’s campaign. With only five paid staff in the state, the Romney campaign probably achieved this voter saturation by contracting with out-of-state phone banks. (The campaign did not respond to questions on the topic.) Much of the political press has missed this data-point, buried in a recent ABC poll, but Romney appears to be running a real field operation. (You don’t usually beat Ron Paul’s army without one.) Romney’s finish in Iowa will reflect that field outreach, as well as Super PAC spending and the dividends from the ten million he spent wooing Iowans last cycle. If political framing was fair (or accurate), Romney would have the highest expectations of any candidate on Tuesday.
Rick the Anti-Mitt?
In many conservative minds, Rick Santorum has become what Rick Perry once was: a true conservative who can actually take the nomination from Mitt Romney.
Santorum’s late surge in Iowa surely reflects both local campaigning and a national disenchantment with the more prominent alternatives to Romney. Bachmann, Perry and now Gingrich each proved to burn brightly, but briefly. Santorum’s cash-strapped operation cannot replicate his Iowa strategy in future states, but that is the whole point of Iowa: a strong finish can jump-start an otherwise dying campaign. He doesn’t need to win, he just needs a strong enough finish to seize the spotlight as the alternative to Romney. Santorum’s speech on Tuesday night will be his introduction to many voters around the country, and given Ron Paul’s limited national appeal, Santorum can sell a third-place finish as the sign that conservatives should rally around him. He has begun making that argument, in essence, by quarantining Paul’s success as a libertarian sideshow in an irrelevant race.
“There’s really three primaries,” Santorum said on Sunday’s Meet The Press. “You have the conservative primary”—which Santorum defines as a race between him, Perry and Bachmann—“you have the libertarian primary, and then you have Gingrich [and] Romney sort of fighting for the establishment vote,” Santorum explained. “And our feeling was from the very beginning if we can pace ahead of Perry and/or Bachmann that we’d be in good shape and [we’re] moving in that direction, certainly, right now.”
The uncompleted thought here is that the libertarian primary ends early, as Paul fever cools. If Santorum can win the conservative primary, consolidating the intensity of the tea partiers and the Romney opponents, he could have the money and momentum for a long primary fight. But put aside the self-serving analysis—is there evidence of three such electorates?
Clearly, Romney appeals to the establishment and the GOP center. (Although most Washington Republicans would put Gingrich in the grassroots conservative category.) The telling error in the Santorum Theory, however, is assuming that Paul’s appeal is strictly limited to libertarian voters.
In fact, Paul owes part of his Iowa traction to support from evangelicals. Among Iowa Republicans, when you ask the self-declared “born again” Christians which candidates they agree with on the issues most important to them, Santorum ranks first (as expected). But Paul comes in second, beating Perry and Bachmann for the ideological kinship of evangelicals. They must see something in him beyond reforming the Fed. And while Romney leads those same evangelicals on the question of who is most electable, Paul also does better on that score than Santorum. To put it in Santorum’s taxonomy, Paul is winning the libertarian primary and getting a decent look in the conservative primary.
After Iowa
Once the Iowa results are in, there will be four key inflection points. First, the top candidates will make their cases in nationally televised speeches on caucus night—a chance for Santorum to go negative, or Romney to debut a confident, general election message. Then, flagging candidates may drop out as early as Wednesday, resorting the field. (Last cycle, Joe Biden and Chris Dodd were out by Wednesday after dismal showings in Iowa.) Finally, the remaining candidates will meet for back-to-back debates on January 7 and 8 in New Hampshire. Who knows, Santorum may even get some air time.

Rob Richie: Understanding How the Iowa Caucuses Work - and Don't Work
The national media is in a frenzy about the Republican contest in tonight's Iowa caucuses. Unfortunately, most journalists seem to be getting the story wrong -- and a key reason is not understanding or even thinking about the rules and their implications.

How Netflix Is Ruining My Relationship (And Might Be Ruining Yours)
Zoë Triska
Senior Books Editor, The Huffington Post	What's not so nice? Having to wait for said person you love in order to watch the rest of the fully-released season. Here are the worst things for me about watching a show with my beloved.

Abusing Women Is Criminal, Not Cultural
Kelly Rutherford
Actress and activist	In some countries it is estimated that as many as seven out of 10 women are beaten, raped, abused or mutilated.
Comments 6 Things We Learned This Week From Goldie and Kim
Ann Brenoff
Senior Writer, The Huffington Post	The Academy Awards appearances of Goldie Hawn, 68, and Kim Novak, 81, triggered a firestorm of fan reaction. Both actresses appeared with what were perceived to be dramatically altered faces and the Internet was quick to harshly criticize them. Can we pause a moment and reconnect with reality -- both theirs and ours?
Comments Binge vs. Buzz: The Release Model of House of Cards vs. True Detective
Jeremy Wilson
Writer + Creative Strategist	There is no doubt Netflix's strategy of enabling users to binge watch old TV episodes has been successful, but is it the optimal strategy for releasing high profile new content?
Comments Aisle View: The Demon Barber of Lincoln Center
Steven Suskin
Drama critic	There is always a place for a production of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's Sweeney Todd, especially one that gives us an oversized orchestra filling the hall with Sondheim's masterful score.
Comments I Witnessed Hollywood's Sexism Firsthand -- And Said Nothing
Kathleen Miles
Associate Editor, HuffPost Los Angeles	One man said, "Would you rather keep the Oscar statue or get a blow job from any actress in the first three rows?"
Comments (359) Why American Women Hate Their Faces, and What They Could Learn From the Brits
Lorraine Devon Wilke
Sass & Sensibility	We've all seen one famous face after another tumble down the rabbit hole of peer pressure, cultural expectations, show business demands, sheer vanity, fear of death, revulsion of aging and the simple miscalculation that the only beauty is youthful beauty. It's a heavy burden.
Comments Dancing With the Stars
Diana Nyad
Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcaster	Some behind-the-scenes snapshots from this morning's Good Morning America announcement of this season's cast of Dancing With the Stars.
Comments The Deceptively Simple Pattern in Popular Songs and Speeches That Makes Them So Catchy
Peter Watts
Writer and presenter	Sarah Palin, James Bond, and Austin Powers walk into a bar. What they do in the rest of the joke is anybody's guess, but what they might do is raise a toast to the darned clever writers who created their catchphrases.
Comments Why Belle Knox's Anonymity Was So Important, As Told by an Out Sex Worker
Eric Barry
Writer, comedian, and creator of the 'Full Disclosure' sex podcast	Belle Knox, who is impressively sagacious at just 18, is joining the company of some tremendous voices in the industry who are redefining what it means to be a sex worker.
Comments Mixology Season 1, Episode 2: The Bathing Proposal
Hulu.com
Watchers of Good TV	The hangover could be settling in earlier than expected for ABC's Mixology, the show about what happens to 10 singles over the course of a single night out in New York City.
Comments Film Fatal Assistance Spotlights Colossal Aid Failure in Haiti
Georgianne Nienaber
Writer and author	Fatal Assistance ably demonstrates the folly and damage caused by swarms of NGO's and Hollywood do-gooders that completely ignored the root causes of Haiti's problems pre and post earthquake.
Comments How Rob Minkoff Turned Mr. Peabody & Sherman Into the Original Modern Family
Jim Hill
Entertainment journalist and Walt Disney Company expert	It's ironic that Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a sequence involving the Trojan horse. Because according to the director of this production, this animated feature is actually something of a Trojan horse in and of itself.
Comments Mighty Movie's Temple of Bad: Karate-Robo Zaborgar
Dan Persons
Film journalist	Well, here's a ticklish situation: Is Karate-Robo Zaborgar a bad film, or a good film trying to be bad, or a film so good at being bad that it's actually bad?
Comments Talking With Mike Gordon, Jonny Two Bags, Seventh Key's Billy Greer and Jimbo Mathus, Plus a Loreena McKennitt Exclusive
Mike Ragogna
Music Biz Vet	"There's probably so many different kinds of albums we could have made, because they were all just little snippets, just moments, some of them maybe implied a song and some were just a lick. But I got all excited and I thought, 'We've got to keep doing this.' ... Some people go to an amusement park, we go sit in a room with guitars."
Comments Garcia v. Google: Hard Cases Make Bad Law
Schuyler M. Moore
Partner, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, LLP; Author	The truth, for good or ill, is that judges rule with their hearts, and then they add a bunch of words to rationalize what they have done. The problem is that those bunch of words are often senseless and more often come back to cause contortions in later decisions.
Comments Content Before Celebrity, Sun Valley Film Festival Serves an Eclectic Menu
Gordy Grundy
Artist and Columnist	The Sun Valley Film Festival is young, with an attitude that is reflective of the city. The programming offers a preference for content over tinsel. The third annual film festival is presented this March 13-16.
Comments Pam Grier Talks 'Dining Out for Life' HIV/AIDS Event and LGBT Issues (AUDIO)
Charlotte Robinson
Broadcast journalist and host, 'OUTTAKE VOICES'	This week I talked with actor Pam Grier -- legendary for her starring roles in Foxy Brown and Jackie Brown, and for her role as Kit Porter on The L Word -- about Dining Out for Life, being a spokesperson for this fabulous event and her spin on LGBT issues.
Comments Older and Fabulous -- It's Not a Fantasy Hollywood Script
Jill Brooke
Author, "The Need to Say No: How to be Bullish and Not Bullied"	In aging gracefully, it's not about doing plastic surgery but over-doing it. It's about making good choices.
Comments Oscar Is Not Religious
Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr.
William M. Suttles Chair of Religious Studies, Georgia State University	The speech shouldn't seem canned and rehearsed or else you appear to have expected to win. It also can't ramble, as there's so little time. And if you have won for being an actor, well, then you're supposed to act well.
Comments Week in Film: Grand Budapest Hotel, The Face of Love
Marshall Fine
Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.com	How do I love the work of Wes Anderson? Let me count the ways. Anderson may be the most consistently original filmmaker to emerge during the 25 years I've been writing about film in New York.
Comments Is Today's Young Music Too Obscene? (Or Has My Perspective Changed?)
The University of Central Florida Forum
Opinion series by faculty, staff and students of UCF	I still sometimes struggle reconciling the self of my youth with the guy who now has a mortgage and an SUV. But the minute I became a parent, my worldview shifted slightly on its axis and I began to view everything through new parental lenses.

"Don't Take Away the Music
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock..." - TAVARES
~ K. St Lewis, F. Perren and C. Yarian
Freddie Foy, the most recognized voice in broadcasting -- "Hi-Ho, Silver!" -- passed away not long ago at 89 and I was reminded that in 2011 radio still knocks me out.
The industry is a fighter. Right now, it's battling to get broadcast radio apps into media devices, smart-phones, and the like, so radio too can be player in the burgeoning popular song arena. Look out world.
And, lethargic Congress already approved legislation that allows thousands of low powered FM stations to do, legally, what underground pirate radio does under the radar.
Fight Number Three: Recording artist and performance royalties. For that argument see Nancy Sinatra's passionate The New York Times op-ed, August 2009.
Which brings me to this quandary: why can't I hear my favorite music on radio? The Recording Industry Association of America claims buyers over 45 years of age rose nearly 10% last decade from 24.7% in 1999 to 33.7% in 2009. Music consumers over 40 now account for nearly half of all "record" purchases. It appears young people download. Older folks plunk down hard cash for CDs.
I spent a lot of my childhood at my paternal grandparents' house with six sensually beautiful Italian aunts with popular music continually on the radio and the Victrola. In the summertime, my "zias" and I would spread out on the front lawn on worn cotton quilts and soak in the sun, a strong scent of Coppertone laced with iodine and baby oil in the atmosphere -- the sound of laughter and pop music filled the air.
Radio formats were looser back then: back to back, you could hear big bands, renowned vocalists, the noisy flavor-of-the-day, a novelty tune, a movie score -- all the Standards in the Great American Songbook, in no particular order. The current hits were repeated over and over and over, and I rarely tired of any of them. Like Julie London's "Cry Me a River," one of the strongest pieces of pop material ever penned to 5-lined staff paper. I wore out that disc.
The melodies and lyrics I'd listen to on those summer days didn't fade when autumn came. I absorbed them; they became a part of me.
Then one winter, my middle aunt, Anna-Marie, had a debilitating bout of rheumatic fever -- which damaged her young, weak, immune system. Not long after, she was packed off to Cleveland Clinic for an experimental heart valve replacement, never to return. The tragedy put a pall on a once-cheery Italian haven -- a household overflowing with music, cigarette smoke, simmering pasta sauce on the Magic Chef, sweet smells from the oven, and ice-cube-clicking cocktail glasses -- suddenly as quiet as the church yard at midnight. The music stopped. Radio was forbidden for a mandatory period of mourning and most of us wore black.
The silence was devastating. I sneaked hits of my records in other places: Hagan's Ice Cream parlor on Main Street, schoolmates' houses and Aunt Mary's on the other side Clarkburg, W. Va., the other side of the family.
The quiet in my house that winter only foreshadowed what was to become of my beloved Standards. In the 1972 monster pop hit "American Pie," singer-songwriter Don MacLean immortalized death, tears, smiles -- and repeated the lyrical line "the day the music died" a half-dozen times. He might well have been lamenting the passing of American Popular Standards as well as the demise of once-mighty radio itself. If we are to believe The New York Times, radio listening in the last ten years has declined more than 14 percent. (Another source, BIA Financial -- BIA estimates per-station revenues as well as hazards long-term trends -- and claims 2009 New York radio ad revenues fell a whopping 16 percent, thus continuing a five-year trend).
What both reports failed to point out is that American Standards all but disappeared from broadcast radio long before. My new hometown, New York City, has not been able to support a 24-hour-a-day "Traditional Music" radio station for 12 years -- AM or FM -- since WQEW (1560 AM) became Radio Disney in December 1998. (The Times leased the station to Radio Disney). When we yearn for "That Old Devil Moon," preferably by Rosemary Clooney, older, seasoned music lovers are stymied by the new bottom line.
Clearly, it's all about dinosaur demographics. Radio programmers and advertising agencies claim not enough mature folks tune in the "The Classics" to justify the advertising dollar. Imagine this: some "Oldies" station programmers even consider hits from the 1970s too passé to spin (an exception is Los Angeles' KRTH 101 -- Number One midday, playing 1970s hits). It's "The Theory of Disposability" in overdrive. Glass bottles, cotton diapers, Vinyl records, old computers, conventional TV sets, cassette players, tape machines, record stores, good barbers, tomatoes with taste, the original Herbal Essence Shampoo (and other favored brands), relationships -- have disappeared and now radio itself.
To music mavens, that's downright depressing. Weren't the radio airways designed for everyone? Is it not immoral, illegal and quite possibly unconstitutional to leave out a healthy segment of the general population simply because radio "top dogs" surmise older listeners don't spend enough money to justify broadcasting, the music they love?
High on my short list of simple pleasures in this relentlessly changing world is an obsession with American Standards -- the subject I know best and love most. (Generally speaking, a Standard is a lasting popular song that predates the mid-1950s arrival of rock and roll -- usually a chart hit, a Broadway show song, or a motion picture tune. Specifically, ANY song can become a standard when it's played, sung, and heard often enough to be fixed in the public's psyche). I believe recorded Standard songs are an art form, and as such deserve to be respected, played, heard, and treasured as any other work of art might be.
Lest you think I am stuck in the past, I'm here to tell you, I've always stayed on top of music's changing tune. When I was a sophomore and had a date with an angel, I put these lush and lugubrious Jackie Gleason 33 rpm's on the turn table -- Music to Make Her Change Her Mind, and Music to Make Her Misty -- heard in the film L.A. Confidential, sandwiched in with a cut or two from Johnny Mathis's Heavenly. These days, with CDs and the nifty random-search feature on my CD Player, I take my chances with highlights from Barry White randomly played, low volume with a delicate dollop of Johnny Hartman. Jazzman Hartman gets my vote on any tune he ever recorded. Highly recommended: John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman. Hartman was the only vocalist to record with genius Coltrane, and the album is a masterpiece.
Which might bring us to my favorite song of all time. While watching CNN's Larry King interview ex-Beatle Paul McCartney one night, I fell out of the wingback when McCartney named his favorite song, "The Very Thought of You." That's my most loved, too. It was written back in 1934 by Ray Noble and was a chart hit for his orchestra that year. It then made the lists again with Vaughn Monroe (1944), Little Willie John (1961); and Ricky Nelson (1964). In between all that, it turned up in the background of "Casablanca" and on the records of every major recording artist in the business. On my "101-MP3-CD-Favorites-Ever" I have "The Very Thought of You" by Ella Fitzgerald, Nancy Wilson, Frank Sinatra, and Tony Bennett.
Which leads to my favorite albums of all time. From the top: A vote goes to Peggy Lee's If You Go, conducted by genius musician-arranger Quincy Jones, with its breathy version of the rogue-y Hoagy Carmichael's "I Get Along Without You Very Well." My first copy was a gift from a platinum-blonde hair stylist from Clarksburg. The album still knocks me out; the hair stylist, on the other hand, left town. Also on this cherished album: "As Time Goes By" and "Smile," as well as a not-too-well-known Irving Berlin song "Maybe it's Because (I Love You too Much)." Sensational stuff.
But, my favorite favorite album of all time is (drum roll): Frances Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim -- a record album and CD I've given to countless friends. My most-coveted selection on Sinatra-Jobim is Irving Berlin's "Change Partners" which tells of a complicated romantic situation made easy in the days before cell phones. Brilliant, Mr. Berlin. The CD also offers: "The Girl from Ipanema," "Dindi," "Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars," "How Insensitive," "Baubles, Bangles and Beads," "Once I Loved," and a boss cut of Cole Porter's "I Concentrate on You." Frank's finest, my favorite.
(We) Lovers of Jazz and American Popular Standards are as passionate about song statistics as the heaviest baseball aficionado. Not long ago I had a heated-but-friendly argument with my old pal, columnist Liz Smith -- yes, she's still alive, in her 89th year, AND working on the Internet with her successful WOWOW, over a Sinatra favorite, the song "Fly Me to the Moon." I feel especially protective of this song -- originally called "In Other Words." I first heard "In Other Words," when I was in high school. A pale girl up the hill, Sandra Lily, introduced me to it on a Bethlehem long-playing album of Chris Connor's. I couldn't plunk my $3.99 fast enough for my own copy of CHRIS.
Liz Smith insists that British chanteuse Mable Mercer was the first to record "In Other Words," and that during the 1950 café society's heyday, she was spellbound night after night by Frank Sinatra "at the Blue Note nightclub" listening to -- and then "swiping" -- Mercer's "entire repertoire and style," including "In Other Words," according to Smith. Liz went on to say that "In Other Words" became "Fly Me to the Moon" with the moon landing in July 1969. Research confirms: The song "In Other Words," composed by Bart Howard, may indeed have been introduced by Mercer at the Blue Note, since Bart Howard was her piano accompanist at the time. But, it was first recorded by Kaye Ballard in 1954, followed by Sylvia Syms in 1955; Johnny Mathis, 1956; Portia Nelson, 1956; Chris Conner, 1957; Eydie Gorme, 1958; and Felicia Sanders in 1959. The song's big moment came with Peggy Lee's live Ed Sullivan Show performance in 1960. With Lee's urging, Bart Howard then changed the title of "In Other Words" to "Fly Me to the Moon" for her recording of the song that year. Next, Nat King Cole recorded "Fly Me to the Moon" in 1961. And soon after, in 1963, the first chart hit -- conductor-pianist Joe Harnell's instrumental-bossa nova, topped out at Number Four. That same year: Connie Francis' 1963 international hit -- in Italian. Also in 1963, Julie London and Patti Page recorded it; then Doris Day in 1964.
Finally, of course, came the most celebrated version -- Frank Sinatra's, with the Count Basie Orchestra, in 1964. Five years later, the song became synonymous with the Apollo moon landing -- Frank said it was his proudest moment -- and by then it was a bona fide Standard. When the spacecraft touched down, I was sitting up in bed on East 19th Street with my eyes glued to a 21-inch black-and-white television, humming along with "Fly Me to the Moon." I failed to convince Liz Smith. Smith repeated her version on her newly celebrated website WOWOW. Okay Liz, you owe me lunch. Heigh-ho. It saddens me to think that Jazz and American Popular Standards (and the accompanying Socratic debates that end with free lunches) are relics to those who control the airwaves, as opposed to the living, breathing, vibrant creations they really are. But maybe there's a solution: What if, in every major American city, there were a subsidized, commercial-free, public radio station that played only the finest Standards, spun expressly for mature listeners and young jazz enthusiasts. Then there never has to be a Day the Music Died. As Teresa Brewer suggested (brightly):
"C'mon, everybody/
Put some nickels in/
And keep that old Nickelodeon playing/
Music, Music, Music..." !
~ Stephen Weiss and Bernie Baum

P.S. TO ALL THAT: When I was about to enter junior high, we were evicted. I got a newspaper delivery route or two, and always found the ninety-eight cents to buy a 45 rpm. (Every Dean Martin cut that invariably turned up later as background in Hollywood movies). In high school, I juggled Rock n' roll, Jazz and American Popular Standards, 45 rpm's and long playing albums...
The bungalow and our new home on Dennison Lane sat up and over about a hundred yards from an indifferently muddy creek and a lazily gurgling waterfall right below my bedroom window. Of a summer's evening, I could plop on the bed, reach over, switch on the Philco and listen to the coolly smooth Nat "King" Cole croon "Mona Liza, Mona Lisa ... men have named you ..." College? I worked ten hour days in a supermarket while carrying a full credit load and still found money to buy lp's. And what lp's they were, then and now: Ella Fitzgerald "Like Someone in Love." Frank Sinatra: Sinatra and Jobim, followed by his remake of the Dorsey standards (arranged by savvy Sy Oliver). Next: Frank's "Nice 'n Easy." Dakota Staton's "Crazy, He Calls Me," right behind "Late, Late Show." Miss Peggy Lee's "If You Go" and still swingy "Latin Ala Lee." Ahmad Jamal's mesmerizing, never tiring "Poinciana." Every single cut by jazz trumpeter-vocalist, Chet Baker. Finally, "Margaret Whiting Sings Jerome Kern." The very day I took my last college final, I was on a three o'clock plane to New York City, those lps in tow... Once established, I got a job (my start as writer as well as music business introduction) doing promotional ads and a music column for Billboard Magazine, "Music on Campus."
Not long after, I made my own contribution to pop culture writing songs (with Twin Peaks' Angelo Badalamenti) and producing records (with musical-actress Melba Moore), both with some success.
Then, CDs debuted. At first, I resisted -- only to give in and become overrun with a new collection as well as duplications of my old lp collection.
Time zipped on. Soon I found myself in mid-life, and I could no longer turn on the radio and listen to the treasured Jazz and Pop Standards of my youth -- unless I was willing to pay for the privilege, due to the aforementioned damnable practice of traditional radio stations' concentrating solely on advertiser-friendly, youth-oriented demographics.
One day I discovered some hopeful signs -- thanks to the World Wide Web. Suddenly, a music aficionado had access to a huge "Radio Universe." Some 14,000 free radio stations popped up on the Internet. Your favorites, and mine, could be switched on and enjoyed merely by accessing the Web. What's more, the genres appeared limitless: Popular Standards, Oldies, Classical, Top 40, Gospel, Country, Talk, etc., etc., etc.
Sure, I'm happy to be able to switch on the computer and surf to the music I love with a click of the mouse. But, booting up the Hewlett-Packard, clicking on a Web site, selecting a genre -- somehow, it's just not the same. Read more from Huffington Post bloggers:

America's over-reliance on consumer spending helped create the mess we are in. To finance our spendthrift ways, we borrowed more than we could afford. We also saved less than necessary and bet that rising home and stock prices would make up the difference. In addition, our willingness to consume more than we produce led to unhealthy imbalances with nations like China.
Well, guess what? The latest data reveals that America is more dependent on the consumer than ever.
Last Thursday, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revealed that personal spending in August rose 0.9 percent, its biggest monthly jump since 2001. Reports suggest the increase stemmed from stepped-up purchases of durable goods like cars, aided by Washington's cash-for-clunkers scheme, as well as aggressive back-to-school promotions by nervous retailers.
The BEA also announced that personal income -- the sum received from all sources, including wages, government transfer payments, and interest -- rose a more subdued 0.2 percent. While the result beat Wall Street's expectations, the gap between the two data points helped to highlight an unsettling development.
More specifically, the relationship between the two has diverged to the point where personal spending is now at a record high relative to income, surpassing the level seen at the pre-financial crisis peak of housing bubble-induced euphoria.
Other data paints a similarly troubling picture. Personal consumption relative to gross domestic product (GDP), the sum total of U.S.-produced goods and services, has also hit a record. Based on estimated data for third quarter GDP, the consumer now accounts for around 72 percent of output, a far cry from the 50-year median of 64.5 percent.
That might not be so bad if the consumer was in better shape than he (or she) was in the past, but various data indicate that is not the case. For example, although household debt relative to net worth is marginally below the second quarter record of 26.9 percent, it is still two-thirds higher than its long-term average.
Another series also shows that households remain stretched, despite some improvement from the record highs seen in the spring of 2008. According to the Federal Reserve, Americans devoted just over 18 percent of their monthly disposable personal income -- the amount left over after income taxes -- to debt, auto lease, rental, homeowners' insurance, and property tax payments in the second quarter.
Aside from the fact that the median average of the Financial Obligations Ratio (FOR) since 1980, when the Fed started keeping tabs on it, is 17.3 percent, or less than we have now, the current measure is above the range that prevailed prior to the accelerated lift-off in housing prices following the 2001 recession.
And while the personal savings rate is no longer scraping along at the unsustainably low levels we saw in the middle of the current decade, at 3 percent it is still less than half of its long-term median and well below the more "normal" levels of 8-10 percent that were commonplace since the Great Depression.
It doesn't help, of course, that severe declines in stock prices and property values have undermined what economists refer to as "the wealth effect," which helped power a measure of past spending. The fact that American's net worth relative to GDP has fallen back to more normal levels while debt loads have remained high is not at all reassuring.
This doesn't even take account of other developments that suggest the health of the consumer is seriously at risk. Along with data released this past week, which revealed that a growing number of Americans are losing their jobs, being forced into foreclosure, and filing for bankruptcy, recent research also highlights the fact that income inequality has hit an all-time high.
In the end, none of this bodes well for an economy whose fortunes are (still) so closely tied to the spendthrift ways of the U.S. consumer. In fact, once the man in the street figures out that, despite the sorry state of his finances, he is the one that is being counted on to rescue the economy, that's when the real trouble will begin.

U.S. GDP Falls AT 0.7 Percent Pace In 2Q
WASHINGTON — The economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter as businesses and consumers trimmed their spending at a slower pace, buttressing beliefs that the economy is now growing.The 0.7 percent dip in gross domestic product for the April-June quarter follows the 6.4 percent annualized drop in the first three months of this year, the worst slide in nearly three decades. In the final quarter of last year, the economy sank at a rate of 5.4 percentThe new reading on second-quarter GDP, reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, shows the economy shrinking less than the 1 percent pace previously estimated. It also was better than the annualized 1.1 percent drop that economists were predicting.The final revision of second-quarter GDP comes on the last day of the third quarter, in which many analysts predict the economy started growing again at a pace of about 3 percent."Growth should be solidly positive," said Mark Vitner, economist at Wells Fargo Securities.
