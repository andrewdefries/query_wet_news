Bib:Love: Campus Callboys In Germany Promise Female Students Good Sex Leads To Good Grades

Weird News
Three men at the University of Mannheim in Germany have created a service called Bib: Love where they volunteer free sex to female students who need to hit something else besides the books.
Generations of male college students have put their collective brain power toward one common goal: Figuring out a way to get female coeds to have noncommital sex with them.
It's a riddle more mysterious than cold fusion or perpetual motion, but a trio of business students at Germany's University of Mannheim claim they've created a program that does just that -- and it's arousing interest and skepticism from all around the globe.
The pervy project is called "Bib:Love," referencing the first letters of "Bibliothek," the German word for library, and, according to the German newspaper Der Spiegel they've pasted posters around the campus promising "Good Grades through Good Sex."
It sounds like a scam -- or at least the plot of a teenage sex comedy -- but creators Oskar, Christopher and Julius insist their motives are purer than simply trying to get babes into bed.
"We are focusing on female students in particular, because they generally come out badly after one-night stands," Christopher, 21, told Der Spiegel. "What's more, girls who just want to have some fun are often labeled as sluts."
Like many ideas, Bib:Love came to them during an alcohol-fueled night last autumn and the concept is simple: Female students who are stressed about the grind of classes and are in the mood for a different kind of grind can contact the guys by email. One of the three creators will show up and, if all goes well, the evening ends in sex.
So far, the Bib:Love boys claim they have serviced five clients, but NBC Chicago reported than some of the women on campus had the sneaking suspicion these campus callboys were just trying to get sex.
In fact, the service's first client said her experience was fun but not "particularly radical," while another student council member, Rosa Reichelberger, said she was skeptical of its claim to help women get better grades.
But nothing succeeds like success and Oskar told the Lithuianian website 15min.it that he and his fellow German gigolos are already being contacted by students at other German universities about franchising the service.

U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) announced his resignation from Congress Wednesday.
Jackson formally submitted his letter of resignation Wednesday afternoon, a congressional aide reportedly told BuzzFeed's D.C. Bureau Chief John Stanton.
(Scroll down to read Jackson's resignation letter, embedded below.)
The Chicago Democrat's brother Jonathan Jackson told the Chicago Tribune earlier Wednesday that the congressman will announce he is leaving Congress in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner early Wednesday afternoon. A Boehner aide confirmed to The Hill's Daniel Strauss that they have received Jackson's resignation letter, a report the Associated Press confirmed.
JJJ Resignation
In the letter, Jackson acknowledges -- for the first time -- the federal investigation into his campaign contribution spending, but cites his health as the reason for his resignation.
"I am aware of the ongoing federal investgation into my activities, and I am doing my best to address the situation responsibly, cooperate with the investgators, and accept responsibility for my mistakes, for they are my mistakes and mine alone," Jackson wrote in the letter.
CNN previously reported that Jackson will announce his resignation from the House floor, but Jackson's condition will preclude him from speaking Wednesday, according to the Sun-Times.
Jackson, 47, reportedly had planned to discuss his political future with his staffers in a conference call Wednesday, but that call was canceled abruptly upon news of the call going public Tuesday evening. The congressman is reportedly engaged in ongoing plea negotiations with the feds concerning allegations that Jackson used campaign contributions for personal use. That reported probe is unrelated to an ongoing "pay-to-play" ethics investigation concerning whether Jackson was aware of efforts to raise money for imprisoned former Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for his appointment to the Senate in 2008.
The congressman has been away from work since June as he sought treatment for bipolar disorder at the Mayo Clinic, which readmitted him last month. His whereabouts have remained unknown in recent days and the congressman had remained silent on the heels of his leaving the Minnesota clinic, for a second time, early last week.
Jackson was handily reelected to his ninth term in Illinois' 2nd congressional district earlier this month despite only addressing his constituents through one robo-call during the campaign season.
From the Associated Press:
Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, now has five days to schedule an election to replace Jackson, and the election must be held within 115 days, according to election officials.
The vacancy left by Jackson's departure creates a rare opportunity for someone else to represent his district, which is made up of South Side Chicago neighborhoods, several southern suburbs and some rural areas. Even this year, when Jackson was absent during the crucial final months of campaigning, he easily defeated two challengers on the ballot, Republican college professor Brian Woodworth and Independent postal worker Marcus Lewis.
Cook County Clerk David Orr said Wednesday in a press conference that the special election could be held on either Feb. 26 or April 9, ABC Chicago reports.
Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, was first elected to Congress in a special election in 1995. His wife, Sandi Jackson, is a Chicago alderman representing the city's 7th ward.

GUANTANAMO NAVY BASE, Cuba -- Judge Col. James Pohl insisted he was the only person who could close the military commission courtroom here a day after a mysterious censor improperly cut off an audiovisual feed of courtroom proceedings.
Journalists and observers are permitted to watch a feed of the courtroom proceedings at Guantanamo on a 40-second delay, a measure intended to prevent the accidental disclosure of classified information. A court reporter in the courtroom has the ability to cut off the feed by pressing a button. But Monday, as a lawyer for confessed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was speaking about a motion, an anonymous censor cut the feed off, frustrating Pohl.
During a closed session later Monday, Pohl indicated he would try to get someone to testify about the courtroom security measures in place at Guantanamo. He admitted Tuesday morning he didn't know who would be the proper witness to testify about who has the ability to cut off access to the courtroom he's supposed to control.
Tuesday morning's proceedings shed little light on who precisely controlled access to the courtroom feed, but Pohl directed the government to provide defense attorneys with an audio-visual expert to explain what technologies are in place. He also made comments that seemed to be directed at the anonymous censor who cut off access to the feed yesterday.
"Only the judge had the authority to close the courtroom," Pohl said, indicating that there was no valid basis to close off proceedings on Monday.
Defense attorneys for the five accused terrorists on trial in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks also expressed concern that all of their communications with their clients were being monitored by the microphones in the courtroom. Pohl said he understood their concerns.
"I think you and I are in the same position in which we're relying on what we think the technology is as opposed to knowing what it is," Pohl told one defense lawyer.
General Mark Martins, the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo, insisted that Pohl had signed off on all the audio-visual capabilities that he was now claiming not to understand.
"Of course it's your courtroom, and everything here is what you direct it to be," Martins told Pohl.
"I think you give me way too much credit as to what I know about what's happening in this courtroom from a technology standpoint," Pohl said.
Martins then chalked it up to a technological misunderstanding, telling Pohl he was "in the same generation as me."

With attempts by the Obama administration to close the facility stalled, some than 170 detainees remain at the detention center, which was opened by the Bush administration after the attacks of 9/11. The facility is run by Joint Task Force Guantanamo, located on the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay on the southeastern coast of Cuba.
