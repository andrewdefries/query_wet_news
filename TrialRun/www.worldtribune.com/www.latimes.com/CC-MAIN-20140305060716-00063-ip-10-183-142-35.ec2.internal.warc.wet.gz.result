Photos: Drifting competition in Long Beach
His stunts drive Web traffic
Photos: Porsche 911s with an edge
A city that speed calls home
By W.J. Hennigan, Los Angeles Times
April 19, 2013, 5:00 a.m.
The tires on Vaughn Gittin Jr.'s Ford Mustang are shrieking as he jerks his car sideways at nearly 90 mph on this serpentine race track in Long Beach.
Walls are closing in on either side, leaving no room for mistakes.
As the next turn nears, Gittin pumps the clutch and yanks a neon green hand brake. The rear wheels lose traction, sending the car into a power slide and unleashing a torrent of smoke into the packed grandstands.
The move brings nearly 15,000 spectators to their feet. This is what they came to see: drifting.
What began as an illegal hobby in Southland parking lots has grown into a multimillion-dollar motor sport appealing to a new generation. The Formula Drift series opened its 10th season last weekend on city streets near the Long Beach Arena. Saturday night, 16 drivers will conduct an encore performance at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.
"In the 39 years of the Grand Prix, no event has ever taken place at night," said Jim Liaw, president and co-founder of Formula Drift. "This is the big time. We're not just guys tearing up asphalt in parking lots anymore."
Indeed. Last week's two-day event took in 20,000 visitors who each paid $27 to $37 for admission, and more are expected at the turnstiles this weekend.
Drifting has nothing to do with racing. There's no checkered flag. It's more like figure skating than speed skating, with a three-judge panel awarding points based on speed, angle of attack and style.
They take points away for going off course, stalling or running into course markers — including walls. And for driving straight: The goal is to control the car as it slides sideways around turns, as if on ice, at full throttle.
