From: To: Pro sports leagues aim to put workers' comp out of play The NFL and others claim retired pro athletes — many from out of state — are ripping off California's workers' comp system. The Legislature may be buying it.
By Michael Hiltzik
March 1, 2013, 7:46 p.m.

Yet here they are trying to put another howler over on us. This is their assertion that retired pro athletes — many of them from outside the state — are ripping off California's workers' compensation system for hundreds of millions of dollars.
The state Legislature is setting itself up to swallow this one whole: A bill to close this supposed loophole has been introduced by Assembly Insurance Committee Chairman Henry Perea (D-Fresno).
