Stranded Carnival cruise ship Triumph
The voyage of the cruise ship Triumph was interrupted when a fire broke out Sunday morning in the ship's engine room as it cruised about 150 miles off Yucatan. The fire left the ship running on generators with limited water. Passengers used cellphones to call and text home, reporting that they were sleeping in hallways, urinating in bags and waiting hours in line for limited food.
