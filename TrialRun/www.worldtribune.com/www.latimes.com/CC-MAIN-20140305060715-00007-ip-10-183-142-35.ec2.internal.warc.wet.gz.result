From: To: Rim fire: More closures in Yosemite National Park Comments
0
By Samantha Schaefer and Diana Marcum
August 25, 2013, 5:23 p.m.
Yosemite National Park officials made additional closures as a precaution and because of air quality as a massive wildfire raged nearby.
The Rim fire, which is burning in and around the park, has scorched nearly 134,000 acres over the last eight days and is 7% contained.
The eastern edge of the fire is active, with increased winds pushing the blaze in that direction and creating huge columns of smoke, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dick Fleishman.
