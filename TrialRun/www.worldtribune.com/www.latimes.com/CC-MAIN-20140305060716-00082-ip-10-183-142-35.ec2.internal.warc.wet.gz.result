CAPTIONS Americana at BrandWhat happens when home is the mall? Glendales new Americana at Brand, developer Rick Carusos $400 million encore to the Grove, is bigger and bolder than its L.A. counterpart, with 238 apartments and 100 condos. Americana has housing, but does it have the charm of a great neighborhood? A place to gather and kvetch? The Home sections Man of the House columnist Chris Erskine slept over for a night to find out. (Carlos Chavez/Los Angeles Times)

Immigration reform: The five most important issues
Efforts to overhaul the nation's immigration system are underway, led by a bipartisan group of eight senators who are expected to unveil a bill after Congress returns from its recess. So far, these efforts have led to at least one significant pact between the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for dealing with foreign low-skilled workers. While the deal represents a breakthrough, lawmakers must still reach agreement on other issues. Here are five that must still be addressed in a comprehensive immigration reform bill. -- Sandra Hernandez

Game 1: Ravens' fresh start turns sour
Boller misfires in debut, Ravens' secondary abused as Steelers pass first test; It's team's worst opening loss ever; Billick says defeat shows 'we have a long way to go'; team trails 27-0 before TDs
By Jamison Hensley
Sun Staff

PITTSBURGH - The opening act of the Ravens' Kyle Boller saga turned into a horror show, and the first steps of a much-hyped defense transformed into a comedy of errors.
Lacking consistency at quarterback and focus in the secondary, the Ravens' coming-out party was crashed unmercifully by the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 34-15 loss before 63,157 at Heinz Field yesterday.
After touting themselves as playoff contenders, the Ravens didn't seem like they were in the same league as the Steelers, much less the same division. The 19-point loss to their AFC North rival represented the worst season-opening loss in the franchise's eight-year history.
"This was very disappointing," Ravens coach Brian Billick said. "We said this was a measuring stick for us to see how far we've come from last year. Obviously, we still have a long way to go."
Boller's first NFL start was predictable - which was predictably erratic for a rookie quarterback.
The 19th overall pick in the NFL draft, Boller misfired on three of his first four throws in a rough initiation against the pressure-packed Pittsburgh defense.
His first throw sailed over running back Jamal Lewis' head. His third was intercepted by linebacker Kendrell Bell. And his fourth was nearly picked off by cornerback Chad Scott, who let the deep pass slip through his arms.
His inexperience had the biggest effect on third downs, where the Ravens failed to convert in 11 of 16 tries.
"I'd be lying if I didn't say I missed some throws I've got to make," said Boller, who finished 22-for-43 for 152 yards and a quarterback rating of 57.5. "There's definitely times when we could have moved the chains if I wouldn't have made a mistake. It was definitely a lot faster than the preseason. I could tell that right away."
The Ravens produced one first down in the first quarter. They didn't cross midfield until 8:35 left in the first half.
By the time they cracked the Steelers' 20-yard line, the Ravens were behind 27-0 late in the third quarter.
"I don't think that [lack of productivity] has anything to do with Kyle," receiver Travis Taylor said. "The offense is made of 11 people. I think with all us working on the same page, we can make up for what he doesn't know or doesn't have."
Boller's first mistake marked his biggest.
