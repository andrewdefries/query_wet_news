You want to take an aggressive approach to keep this thing under control, next thing they will want to do is x-rays about every 3 months $$ My dog did not like his special diet either, he would look at his dog dish and bark! After a few days of this and my adding a little chicken broth to his food to entice him, he started to gobble up whatever I put down. He's ok with it now.

No need to be snippy I'm in charge, the doctor did mention to add water but not an entire cup for the amount of food I am giving. He's a cat and is only allowed to eat about 1/2 cup of dry food a day. You have chosen to ignore posts from pingo.

I have the "Ignore" option too, but I lost the "Edit". And what it this with "New Post"?Good to have a diagnosis, Winter. At least you can do something about it. Hope he is improving w/you TLC. Interesting about the cold tub, but it makes sense.Funny about Desmond playing fetch, tt. Maybe he has dog genes in him. Novenber, you hit it on the nail. That is exactly the way I feel here, sitting around with old friends for a cup of tea or coffee. And I ususally post whille drinking my morning coffee and my afternoon tea.

Garnett is now a part time role player for 11 million a year. 23 minutes last night. Good thing we are saving him for the playoffs. Love seeing the Celtics raise the white flag early in these games and say, "Well, it's obvious we are not going to beat you, so we'll rest KG for the playoffs." Blow it up now. This team does not have enough talent to afford the luxury of a 11 million dollar role player. We need guys who can play 40 minutes a game. Trade him to Minnesota for Kirilenko and Derrick Williams. He'll agree to that trade. It elevates Minnesota and it helps the Celtics.

That's the Celtics way of saying you'll not have to worry about being traded. [/QUOTE]You do understand that a player can waive a no trade clause, right? Does he really want to end his career toiling in Boston irrelevancy or go to a team he could make into a contender?

In response to Fierce34's comment:[QUOTE] In response to damfuno's comment:[QUOTE] All true enough but if the Celtics keep playing with the lackluster jump shooting team they are the Boston fans will not tolerate it and the boo birds will be flocking more that the swallows of Capistrano.......I believe that the Boston fans are maybe second behind the Philadelphia fans as far as expectations of having an elite team.......and as we stand now we are far far away from being an elite team........no owner wants to see his team on national TV get booed for poor uninspired performance [/QUOTE] Jan. 15 is less than 3 weeks away. A change will be coming. [/QUOTE]Celtics don't really have all that much to offer, though. I love the pie-in-the-sky trades that get thrown back and forth on this board where the Celtics get the best players for garbage (Lee and Bass). Here are the players who have value on the Celtics - Rondo, Pierce (market limited-only contending teams will be interested in him and the money would be difficult to match), KG, Sullinger, and MAYBE Green, but he's soft as the day is long. Green can score when he wants to, but he doesn't really do too much else. Avery Bradley too, but I wouldn't trade him or Sully because they are part of the solution, not the problem.

KG told Danny and Doc 11 million is worth 20+ minutes a game!! He's still one of the highest paid players in the league if you go by minutes played!! That KG is one smart dude!!

TFB12 YOU SAID AND THEN ASKED ME: "Since you are Rusty's BFF now, ahhh, would you please ask him if he still thinks Welker has lined up in the slot more then Amendola has. I gotta know. HAhahaha!! Come on mr ex football player, do you happen to know? Give me a quick guess what you think on that answer. And while you and your new BFF mingle over dinner tonight ask him." RallyC said: "Wes Welker"
TFB12 reponded:
"Bwahahahaha! Troll! You are wrong! Just like when Rusty was on here telling everyone that Amendola is going to do this and that as a Patriot because he lines up so much more on the outside and Wes only lined up at the slot. Wrong! Complete opposite.. go look at the numbers and if you have a problem finding them I will provide them for you. "
Here are the facts in black and white, TFB12 aka LIAR:
Year WW Slot Routes WW Slot YPRR DA Slot Routes DA Slot YPRR
2009 322 3.06 284 0.97 2010 295 1.77 364 1.78
2011 427 2.83 16 2.25
2012 508 2.05 261 1.91
"MORE THAN" MEANS TOTAL NUMBERS NOT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR OWN PLAYS, THAT WOULD BE "MORE OFTEN" STUPID! Was I wrong because you don't know what you are trying to say/ask??? LIAR.......Go ahead little girl, try to make yourself feel better about being dumb.....Now then, WHO OWNS YOU TFB12!!!? HAHAHAHAH!!! DON'T HIDE NOW BIG MOUTH!!!! LIAR......In case you missed it the first time:
Year WW Slot Routes WW Slot YPRR DA Slot Routes DA Slot YPRR
2009 322 3.06 284 0.97 2010 295 1.77 364 1.78
2011 427 2.83 16 2.25
