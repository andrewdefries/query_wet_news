2013 belongs to Jennifer Lawrence.
From winning a Golden Globe in January, to being nominated for another Globe in December, the 23-year-old actress has stayed at the center of Hollywood's attention all year long. We've picked a memorable highlight from each of the past 12 months because, let's face it, we wish we were JLaw, and reliving her award wins, amazing faces, and epic fails makes us feel just a little closer to the legend in the making.
1. January
Some people may tell you that you aren't a true Jennifer Lawrence fan unless you've seen "Winter's Bone," which we understand (she was nominated for a 2011 Golden Globe and an Academy Award for that role). But we think falling in love with her while watching her Golden Globe-winning performance in "Silver Linings Playbook" is just as acceptable. via weheartit
Lawrence plays the recently widowed Tiffany who is suffering from depression. After a tumultuous dance-filled courtship, she becomes Pat's (Bradley Cooper) main squeeze. By tumultuous, we mean bat-bleep crazy on Lawrence and Cooper's parts, but that's part of why the movie is fantastic.
2. February
via Mashable
The awards train continued to roll for Lawrence at the Academy Awards this year. JLaw took home the award for best actress on Feb. 24, her first Oscar, but her win was briefly overshadowed by a not-so-graceful fall up the stage steps on her way to accept it. Other shining moments from the night: Lawrence telling Ryan Seacrest she was starving and asking if there would be food on the red carpet; Lawrence getting videobombed by Jack Nicholson after the show (and having a minor freak-out); and Lawrence giving the bird to cameras after her big win. Three more reasons she ruled 2013.
3. March

I think Cherry was spot on last night in calling Lucic's fight a "disgrace." The progression of that fight pretty much sums up the Bruins efforts as a team this season. For those who didn't watch, Lucic fights with Orr, then inexplicably stops because he feels like the fight is done. Then, he kinda stands there stupidly while the confused linesmen slowly step in just before Orr took a run at him. I don't care what miscommunication happened, you don't just GIVE UP! I know he's been battling some injuries this year, but as a player who SHOULD be the emotional leader of the Bruins, it was disappointing to see him stop the fight himself. If you agree to fight, you fight from start to finish, no excuses.It sums up the Bruins' attitude on the ice this season. The players want to do just enough to get the job done, but god forbid anyone put in the extra effort! The Bruins wonder why they have such a tough time breaking out of their own end -- it's too run of the mill. The Bruins wonder why they have such a tough time moving the puck into the offensive zone -- I don't see the Bruins really attacking the offensive blue line with speed. Too much prescription and not enough trying to win the game.I'm not saying that the game plan is a poor one. Instead, I'm saying that the Bruins feel wayyyy to comfortable with their game plan right now, and it definitely shows.

I don't like any of the poll options. Guys stop fights when they know they're done all the time - they bear hug or they tackle the other guy. And you see a lot of fights end the way Lucic thought this one was about to - both guys starting to sag a bit - the tension drops out of the grips - the linesemen get in and the guys skate away. I'm not sure I see any disgrace here, but this definitely wasn't Lucic's best pugilistic effort for whatever reason. But...so? And given Cherry is such a big backer of the code, why isn't he laying into Orr for trying to restart a fight with a guy who had engaged fully, taken his lumps, but was clearly done? Especially given that that guy had respected the code and not hammered Orr into paste when he was vulnerable?I'm also not sure about "comfortable". Complacent worked at the beginning of the year, but tentative is a better fit now. They look like a team that's playing under a cloud, knowing that they have little margin of error for mistakes. They don't shoot because they don't expect to score. They go back to the point constantly because that's the default in their offensive cycle - and teams are just jumping those passes now, especially just inside the offensive blueline. They miss open nets and glorious chances because they're too afraid of missing to move the puck with purpose.

I watched the fight on YouTube and Orr clearly won by landing more punches, even with Luc keeping his helmet on. And it was clear that Orr wasn't done by the way he was still "chasing" Luc when the linesmen jumped in. This doesn't surprise me because when Orr was in Providence I never saw him lose a fight.....not one. I'm going to speculate Luc gave up because he knew he was beat. It happens.

It looks to me that Lucic was the only person in the stadium that thought the fight was over. From the linesmen's hesitation they thought Lucic was just regrouping to attack again from another angle or just swithing strategies, not quiting.That's the most disgraceful way to loss a fight.

I know I'm being really critical of Lucic's fight. I realize that people get beat sometimes, and I don't think Lucic is immortal or anything. But, I was pointing out how the attitude of that fight is a great metaphor for the attitude of the Bruins -- they are doing the bare minimum. No one is taking their game to the next level. They just look slow and methodical rather than crisp and urgent, both of which they should be at this point in the season. That leads me to believe that team is falling back on their bare-bone structure (their comfort zone), rather than imposing the creativity needed to keep opposing teams off guard. There are far to many players wandering around the ice, waiting for a teammate to get the job done.

Boston Globe / Spotlight / Abuse in the Catholic Church
THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING
Law says painful journey led to policy's passage
By Michael Paulson, Globe Staff, 6/15/2002
ALLAS - Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston, saying his painful experience mishandling clergy sexual abuse cases helped lead US Catholic bishops to approve tougher child protection measures yesterday, declared last night that he now hopes to restore his effectiveness as archbishop of Boston with the help of God.
Despite persistent calls for his resignation from lay people in Boston and throughout the country, Law said that he plans to remain in his current post.
''I'm here as archbishop, and that's where I should be,'' he said.
Law would not say whether he ever offered to step down, although he has acknowledged discussing the issue of his resignation with Pope John Paul II in April.
''As a matter of policy, I don't discuss conversations that I have with the Holy Father - I think those are really privileged conversations,'' he said.
Law, who has been archbishop of Boston since 1984 and was one of the most influential prelates in the United States, has been embroiled in controversy since January, when the Globe reported details of how he allowed the Rev. John J. Geoghan to remain in ministry despite knowing that Geoghan was an alleged child molester. The story sparked a nationwide furor over the church's handling of sexually abusive priests around the country, and in response, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, at a meeting in Dallas yesterday, approved a new mandatory child protection policy for all dioceses.
Law pointed out that in January, in response to concern over the Geoghan case, he decided that the Archdiocese of Boston would report all allegations of sexual abuse to state authorities, even though such a step was not then required by state law. He also decided to remove from ministry all priests ever accused of abuse, which led to the dismissal of more than a dozen priests. Those two provisions are now national policy, as a result of the vote taken by the bishops yesterday. ''In some ways, I think being archbishop anywhere, or being a bishop anywhere in the United States these days, is a daunting challenge, and certainly it has provided unique challenges for me over the past six months. But I believe that what happened today [when the bishops voted] benefited by that painful experience,'' he said. ''I think the charter [for the protection of children] has benefited by the difficult lessons that I have learned in Boston.''
Law said he will be able to function effectively as a moral leader ''only with God's help, and I pray for that constantly.''
Law had not spoken to the news media since February, but last night, after the bishops finished their debate and celebrated Mass, he granted five-minute, one-on-one interviews to five Boston television affiliates and the city's two daily newspapers. Seated in a hotel suite, he w
