Maybe it is difficult to predict how many inches of snow will fall, but what is easily predictable is the progressive global warming crowd trying to cash in and do some scaremongering and propaganda to the low information crowd, based on the latest weather event. Boston Globe editorial , Monday:
"The severity of the epic historic blizzard that crippled New England over the weekend clearly was influenced by "climate change". Hurricanes have hit; tornadoes have killed people, and heat waves have hit. Now an epic snowstorm....Lions and tigers and bears, OH MY!"
"Congress must pass emergency legislation to have a 'carbon' tax, and close all coal plants, and 'invest' in clean energy. All New Englanders must drive a Volt as part of their civic duty to prevent such man-made events from occurring again!"
FYI Virginia's forecast:
Friday .... becoming mostly sunny, with a high near 51.
Saturday..... Sunny, with a high near 47...

Dou(c)hebag climate change deniers who rudely gloat from warmer states. The OP scores one for their side. But if this was a hurricane hitting alabama shores or a drought in texas, he would surely pay due deference. What a coo(z)e. You have chosen to ignore posts from ComingLiberalCrackup.

Makes sense that Julien has been mixing and matching in games these past weeks in response to injuries and horrible team play, but it was a breath of fresh air to read this:Today’s lineupMilan Lucic-David Krejci-Jordan CaronBrad Marchand-Patrice Bergeron-Tyler SeguinBenoit Pouliot-Chris Kelly-Brian RolstonDaniel Paille-Gregory Campbell-Shawn ThorntonZdeno Chara-Dennis SeidenbergAndrew Ference-Johnny BoychukGreg Zanon-Adam McQuaidMike Mottau-Joe CorvoMy response? THIS is the light at the end of the tunnel we've all been looking for. The Seguin experiment w/ Krejci was good at first but clearly ran its course. Rolston simply wasn't working on the Bergeron line. Paille on the 3rd line wasn't any better. The defence has been scrambling, with Seids and Chara looking like they are trying to do everything themselves out there, and therefore not doing much of anything.THIS is what the lineup should be. When Peverly comes back, he can be plugged in for Caron, Rolston or Pouliot, depending on what those lines are doing at the time of his return. Everyone else stay put! Chara and Seids can recapture their game by working together, and we know that Boychuck and Ference are a good fit. Zanon-McQuaid your prototypical stay-at-home 3rd pairing.Roll with this, Claude. Give it time. Let your players get back to basics and be comfortable. I think this is the lineup that can turn things around. If not, then the Bs don't deserve the playoffs anyway.

Police search for rock throwers on I-495 in Middleborough E-mail|Link|Comments ()
August 17, 2009 01:22 PM
By Jazmine Ulloa, Globe Correspondent
State Police are asking the public's help finding vandals who threw large rocks over the weekend onto Interstate 495 in Raynham and damaged 19 vehicles.
No injuries were reported, but some of the rocks shattered windshields and dented car roofs. Two cars also drove over the rocks and damaging their undercarriages. "They were small enough to be thrown a good distance, but large enough to cause significant damage," said State Police Spokesman Dave Procopio. State Police received several calls about the rocks being thrown onto the interstate at 10 p.m. on Saturday near the intersection with Route 138.The granite-like stones were similar to those found along a railroad that runs below the interstate, Procopio said. The majority of the vehicles struck were driving north on I-495, but two were hit in southbound lanes. Some of the rocks were as large as baseballs.
"We are very fortunate no one was injured or even killed," Procopio said. "This is a very serious crime."
Anyone with information about the crime or who may have seen suspicious activity in the area is asked to call the Middleborough barracks of the State Police at (508) 947-2222.

Washington Push in Congress for Web users to control data

WASHINGTON — Congress is preparing to wade into the largely invisible and, for most consumers, mysterious practices employed by Google, Facebook, and other websites to harvest information about the individual preferences of computer users, fueling a battle that could shape the future of the Internet.Consumers would have more say in how their browsing habits and personal data can be used to customize advertising for their personal tastes, under Senate legislation being drafted by Senator John Kerry, with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Kerry said in an interview yesterday that individuals would never tolerate a private detective secretly recording their every move for the benefit of marketing agencies, so why, he said, should they permit it on the Internet?“When you go on the Internet, are you as an American consenting to having your private activities shared with other people?’’ said Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat.The legislation, which would let consumers refuse to have their browsing history shared with marketers, could be introduced as early as next week. Although details have not been disclosed, Kerry said he has won the initial support of Internet giants Google and Microsoft and continues to consult with Facebook. He also has consulted with consumer and privacy advocates.For Internet companies, Kerry said, “it’s better to have a standard established by Congress than have the Federal Trade Commission impose something.’’Some online advertising firms and academic observers have sounded an alarm, warning that federal legislation could stifle innovation and raise the cost of popular Internet services such as search engines that consumers expect to be free of charge.“There is a high level of concern about killing the goose that lays the Internet’s golden eggs,’’ said Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who studies free speech, Internet, and technology issues. “It potentially puts at risk the great free Internet we know today.’’Search engines, for example, are free to use because they are powered by advertising. “My question is: What’s the harm of collecting that information? And have we considered the benefits of collection?’’Google and Facebook, relative newcomers to Washington, are beefing up their Capitol Hill lobbying presence as they seek to shape the debate over their practices and growing market power. The FTC and the Department of Commerce issued studies on Internet privacy in recent months, warning that privacy concerns could undermine public trust in new Internet services, and could harm online commerce.The FTC announced a settlement with Google yesterday over its sharing of information associated with the launch of its Buzz social-networking program.Several online privacy bills have been filed in the US House, and Representatives Ed Markey, a Bay State Democrat, and Joe Barton,
