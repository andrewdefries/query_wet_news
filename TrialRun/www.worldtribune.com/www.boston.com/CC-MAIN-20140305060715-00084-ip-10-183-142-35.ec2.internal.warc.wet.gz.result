Damn. There's really no one on that team that I like.They added Staal and now Semin but their defence is still questionable. In a weak division like the south they should have a decent shot at getting back into the playoffs.

WASHINGTON - President Obama, reminding lawmakers “the whole world is watching,’’ exhorted them last night to break through partisan bickering and pass a comprehensive budget deal that protects Americans from the pain of a government default in one week.The prime-time address to the nation came hours after House and Senate leaders released dueling plans that promised to spark days of battles between the chambers and within the parties. No clear path to a resolution emerged.Invoking the words and actions of Ronald Reagan and hinting of impending economic havoc, the president told lawmakers failure is not an option.“The American people may have voted for divided government, but they didn’t vote for a dysfunctional government,’’ Obama said during a 15-minute address. “We can’t allow the American people to become collateral damage to Washington’s warfare.’’A hint of how lawmakers will respond is expected to come as soon as tomorrow.

East Boston earned a 59-57 overtime victory over Dorchester in the first matchup and New Mission defeated Snowden, 66-50, in the late game Wednesday at Madison Park. The two teams will go head-to-head in the city championship Thursday.
In the first semifinal, junior guard Dion Knight carried East Boston with a game-high 35 points. He scored 9 in the first quarter and gave the Jets an early 16-7 lead.
�We gotta ride him, he�s our go-to guy. We go as Dion goes,� East Boston coach Shawn Brown said. �And in that situation it�s get the ball to Dion and we play off of Dion, it�s no secret.�
Dorchester�s defense tightened up in the second quarter. After trailing, 23-10, The Bears went on a 16-4 run behind two 3-pointers from senior guard/forward Tavon Smallpiece and trailed by just 1 at halftime.
After a low-scoring third quarter, Dorchester led, 36-35. The teams swapped 1-point leads to start the fourth quarter. Down 42-41, Knight gave East Boston its largest lead of the frame after a layup and a 3-pointer. Layups from Dorchester junior guard Justin Clarke and Smallpiece tied the game at 46 with just over a minute to play.
Neither team could score in the final seconds and the game headed to overtime.
�It was a scary thing,� Knight said. �I thought we were gonna lose. I had to keep my head in the game.�
Brown said he told his team that overtime was just four more minutes to win the game.
�I told them at that point it�s about them,� Brown said. �They gotta want it more, it�s about who wants it more. And they came out and worked hard.�
Overtime was much like the final quarter. The teams traded buckets and the score was knotted at 55 with 1:47 to play. Knight sank two free throws to give East Boston the edge, but senior guard Khail Newson made a layup to tie the game once again.
With just 34.8 seconds left on the clock, Mitchell scored to put the Jets on top. Dorchester was unable to score on its final possession and East Boston escaped with the victory.
Dorchester senior guard Markus Neale notched his 1,000th career point and finished with 15 in the loss.
In the second game, New Mission coach Cory McCarthy earned his 200th win and senior forward Fred Rivers scored a game-high 21 points for the Titans. Senior forward Asante Sandiford added 12 points, including three huge one-handed dunks.
�Snowden, they�re a good team,� Rivers said. �They came out, they gave us their best in the first and then we felt we needed to turn it up a little notch so we came out and tried to have as much fun as we could playing.�

South Boston defeated Dorchester, 45-28, in the first game and Fenway cruised to a 56-15 victory over Brighton in the second matchup of the Boston City League championship basketball semifinals. The first semifinal between South Boston and Dorchester was a tight defensive battle. After a low-scoring first quarter, the Knights held a 7-6 lead. Scoring proved no easier in the second quarter, and Dorchester took a 14-13 lead into the half.
�I told them at the halftime we needed to go back to what we did the whole season to get us where we are,� said South Boston coach Andrea Higgins. �We were taking good shots, but we weren�t taking great shots. We needed to attack the basket, we needed to step up on defense. Our defense all year has created our offense.� Dorchester took an 18-13 lead at the start of the third quarter after junior guard Verdine Casimir scored and senior guard Phylis Nyamunda followed with a steal and a layup.
South Boston sophomore guard Jocelyn Harris answered with two consecutive layups and Kadijah Young hit a free throw to tie it. After Nyamunda gave Dorchester a 20-18 lead, Harris scored on another layup and drained a 3-pointer to put the Knights back on top. �It�s a team effort all the time,� Higgins said. �And on any given night, any one of my kids has stepped up and Jocelyn kept us right there and actually gave us the lead.�
The Knights took a 27-22 lead into the fourth quarter and never trailed again. Junior forward Destinee Morris (game-high 18 points) nailed two 3-pointers off feeds from senior guard Elaina Wright-McCarthy in the final frame to close out the victory.
Nyamunda led the Bears with 12 points. Harris chipped in 11 for South Boston.
�Heading into the championship, our goal is to win,� Higgins said. �We�ve played Fenway twice, they�re our only two losses this year. We�ve obviously seen them, we know what they have. We know what we have to do in order to win.�
Fenway�s offense fired on all cylinders in the second semifinal game. Sophomore guard Takora McIntyre finished with 18 points for the Panthers and junior forward Jalisa Ross added 17. Senior guard Walae Hayek scored 6 points for Brighton.
Although Brighton was the fourth-place team in the South Division and earned a spot in the city tournament because the top two teams in the division were barred from competing, Fenway coach John Rice did not take his opponent lightly.
�It�s the cities,� Rice said. �Anybody here is good enough to be here and that�s just the way we approached it.� South Boston and Fenway will compete for the City League title Thursday at 5 p.m. at Madison Park.
�They�re athletic, they�re tough,� Rice said of South Boston. �We played them twice. They�re our toughest competitor in the league every year. They�re well-coached. Coach was a Division 1 ballplayer herself, she knows the game. You know, we�re both familiar with each other. I expect a good game.�

Championship week: City League basketball and hockey titles on the line

Boston City League champions will be crowned this week in girls� basketball, boys� basketball and boys� hockey. Basketball will be held at Madison Park with the hockey championship at Northeastern�s Matthews Arena. The action kicks off Tuesday with the girls� basketball semifinals. The Boston South champion Dorchester Bears take on the runner-up from the North Division, South Boston, at 4 p.m. South Boston earned an impressive 15-2 record this season. Dorchester, which finished at 9-8, will face an uphill battle as they try to knock off the Knights. The second girls� semifinal will begin at 5:30 p.m. with the champion from the North, Fenway, challenging Brighton, the South Division�s runner-up. Fenway cruised to a perfect 12-0 City League record this season and is the favorite to win the title. Sophomore guard Takora McIntyre will look to carry her team in the tournament with her relentless defense and ability to score from all areas of the floor. The winner of each semifinal will advance to the championship. The title game is scheduled for Thursday at 5 p.m. The boys� semifinals begin Wednesday at 4 p.m. with Central Division champion Dorchester going head-to-head with East Boston, the runner-up in the North Division.
Dorchester posted a 16-4 record this season courtesy of a high-powered offense comprised of seniors Markus Neale, Tavon Smallpiece, and Khail Newson. But Dorchester did lose to East Boston earlier this season, and the Bears� defense will have its hands full with East Boston�s sharpshooting junior forward Kevin Sinatra and junior guard Dion Knight. Knight has been one of the city�s top scorers this season, consistently posting over 20 points per game. Boston North champion New Mission will take on South champion Snowden in the second semifinal at 5:30 p.m. New Mission fell to Brighton in last year�s city championship, but this year the Titans are in position to bring home the title. Snowden posted a 7-14 record this season and struggled against teams outside of the City League South Division. The Cougars will have a tough time containing New Mission�s high-scoring seniors Shaquan Murray and Asante Sandiford.
The boys� championship game will be Thursday at 6:30 p.m., right after the girls� championship.
A City League championship trophy for hockey will be awarded Wednesday morning at Matthews. Six-time defending champion Latin Academy will face off with East Boston for the title at 10 a.m. The first time these two teams met this season, Latin Academy captain Mark Guerard netted a hat trick to give the Dragons a 5-3 victory. But East Boston refused to drop the second matchup and the two teams skated to a 3-3 tie. Although Latin Academy has won six straight titles, this is anyone�s game. If the Jets score early on Latin Academy goalie Thomas Guarino, who is only in eighth grade, East Boston could come away as the new City League champion.

The Dorchester boys� basketball team defeated Fenway High, 86-40, on the Panthers� home court Tuesday night. Five Dorchester seniors scored in double-digits and the Bears� strong defensive play held Fenway to just 3 points in the second quarter.
Senior guard Markus Neale tallied a game-high 24 points for the Bears, who improved to 7-2.
�I thought I did pretty good,� Neale said. �It was a team effort today and we just got the job done.� Dorchester senior guard Khail Newson scored 14 points and seniors Dean Lee, Leon Sealy and Tavon Smallpiece each chipped in 11.
�They get after it, the seniors,� Dorchester coach Johnny Williams said. �We�re a senior- led team. We don�t hold back because we�re not playing cupcakes. Every team we play is a formidable opponent.� Dorchester led, 22-10, aftger the opening quarter. The Bears extended their lead in the second quarter thanks to lights-out 3-point shooting. Lee and Neale knocked down two threes each as Dorchester built a 47-13 lead heading into halftime. �We have great shooters that we just work on within our sets,� Williams said. �All of my guys are guards. So they all have to work on ball-handling, shooting on the next level if they play collegiate basketball. They�re nothing but guards. I don�t have 6-10s, 6-11s, so they�re all guards.�
Dorchester continued to dominate in the second half. Lee and Neale each hit 3-pointers in the third quarter and the Bears carried a 69-26 lead into the final eight minutes.
Although Dorchester held a 43-point advantage at the start of the fourth quarter, the Bears played with intensity until the final buzzer. �To get where we have to go we have to play hard consistently, can�t let up,� Newson said. �A team like Fenway � we see better competition but it�s teams like this where we got to play harder and work on stuff because when we make a run at states we know how to keep our foot on the gas.�

Kaba sparks Dorchester in win over CASH

January 10, 2014 07:19 PM	By Emily McCarthy, Boston.com Correspondent
Led by freshman guard Masseny Kaba, the Dorchester girls� basketball team earned its second win of the season Friday night, defeating visiting CASH, 38-21. Kaba scored a game-high 13 points and pulled down more than 10 rebounds. She also played consistent defense, making two statement blocks. Although she is younger than many girls on the team, Kaba is without question the Bears� leader.
�She�s only in ninth grade, so I have her for a couple more years, so I�m building around her,� said Dorchester coach Raul Brown. �Our future looks bright as long as she continues to stay at TBA [TechBoston Academy] with us.�
After the first quarter, Dorchester held a slim 7-6 advantage. But the Bears offense picked up in the second quarter as Kaba scored 7 points and freshman forward Tianna Daniels chipped in 4. The Bears held CASH to just 2 points in the quarter and began to pull away, taking an 18-8 lead at halftime.
�I feel that I did a good job and that I was helping my team and I was a leader,� Kaba said. �It�s kind of hard being tall and trying to play point guard and do all that other stuff as a freshman. I started playing when I was in seventh grade and I didn�t know nothing at all, so I was taught. And I�m just now getting better.�
Dorchester continued to play well in the second half, backed by Kaba�s defensive presence.
�I like to play aggressive,� she said. �If I know I can block it, then I�m going to block it, but I don�t like to foul.�
The Bears carried a 28-14 lead into the final eight minutes, and closed out the victory with 3-pointers from eighth-grader Briana Irwin and senior Nyzaya Ambers. With the win, Dorchester improved to 2-5. �We�ve been working on a lot of passing and dribbling," said Brown. "You know our girls can�t really do much if they can�t dribble. So what I�ve been doing a lot in practice is having a lot of dribble drills, a lot of passing drills. "And I've got a couple seniors on the team, so I told them this is their last year, they've got to show what kind of caliber team they�re going to be this year.
�Our team�s really young but I�m really excited about what we have.�

St. John's Prep takes over top spot in baseball top 20

April 28, 2013 06:28 PM	By Alex Hall, Globe Correspondent
St. John�s Prep takes over the new No. 1 spot in the top 20 after defeating BC High, 6-5, last Wednesday on the road. Newton North is still undefeated at 10-0 but the the Prep�s schedule against the likes of BC High and Xaverian gave them the edge this week over the Tigers. As for the fourth and fifth-place spots, it was a hard call between BC High and the Rebels of Walpole. Walpole has played more games (currently 9-1) than the Eagles but if strength of opponents gave the Prep the edge we had to apply that same principal to the close battle for fourth and fith place. Danvers moved up three spots from last week after going 2-0 since last Sunday. The Falcons are 6-0 on the year, joining Newton North, Archbishop Williams and North Reading in the undefeated top 20 teams club.
As for Coyle & Cassidy, the Warriors might not be undefeated but they are leading the Eastern Athletic Conference at the moment. With an 8-1 overall record paired with an undefeated league mark, the Warriors climbed to the 11th spot this week. Looking toward the bottom of the rankings, Xaverian stays in the top 20 despite a less-than-stellar record so far this year. Much like last year, the Hawks have struggled to start this season with a 5-4 record. They split their two games this past week, defeating Brockton last Monday but losing to Catholic Conference rival Catholic Memorial on Wednesday. It�s getting harder and harder to keep the Hawks on this list based on anything but name and their Division 1 title from a year ago.

BC High claims No. 1 spot in new baseball top 20

April 21, 2013 04:15 PM	By Alex Hall, Globe Correspondent Undefeated BC High tops the new Boston.com baseball top 20 with some impressive wins already notched. The Eagles have scored at least eight runs in all but one game this year, with the one exception being their 2-1 victory over Malden Catholic.
Conference rival St. John�s Prep takes the No. 2 spot, with its 7-1 record so far. The Prep has played more games and thus won more than BC High, but the opening game blemish against Xaverian keeps it from the No. 1 ranking. As for Xaverian, the No. 14 Hawks have had a tough go so far. The team has losses to Wellesley, Peabody and Newton North on its resume. While all those defeats came against teams owning a position in the first 13 spots of this top 20, you have to beat top teams when you�re the defending Division 1 champion.
Looking toward the last few spots on the list, No. 18 Reading has had a surprisingly ho-hum start to the season. The Rockets crushed Wilmington and Winchester by a combined score of 22-1 in their first two games, but have dropped two straight against Melrose and Burlington. When the Rockets are at their best, they are a dominant team, but they haven�t always brought their best this year.

5 things you need to know in boys� hockey this week
Link|Comments ()
Posted by Staff
February 9, 2013 08:00 AM	By Alex Hall, Globe Correspondent
Here are some tidbits you should know in boys' hockey this week:
1. Nemo affecting hockey scheduling -- With the impending storm about to affect the greater Boston area, many hockey games scheduled for this Saturday have been moved to today or being rescheduled for a later date. For example, St. John�s Prep�s game against St. John�s (S) has already been postponed. If you�re planning to go to a game this Saturday, check to make sure that it hasn�t been moved or cancelled. Also, make sure it�s going to be a safe drive to get to the rink if the game you want to see is still on for Saturday.
2. BC High vs. Springfield Cathedral Showdown Today -- It�s two of the Globe�s top three teams; it�s two of the top contenders to win the Super 8 tournament. It�s BC High vs. Springfield Cathedral and it�s tonight at UMass Boston at 7 p.m.. The Eagles will be looking for revenge after falling to the Panthers 3-2 on the road back on Jan. 12. The Panthers are looking to further solidify their ranking as the Globe�s No. 1 team and the best team in the commonwealth. If the Panthers want to silence any of their remaining naysayers and further impress the Super 8 committee, they have to win this game tonight.
3. Central Catholic vs. Chelmsford a big tilt Saturday -- Pending that the game actually takes place, No. 19 Chelmsford will take on No. 5 Central Catholic this Saturday. The Lions haven�t lost since playing CC back on Jan. 12 where they lost 8-4. The Raiders are coming off an embarrassing 4-0 loss to the struggling Malden Catholic, who just go back over .500 with the win. If Chelmsford wants to make up for its earlier loss to the Raiders, it appears now is a good time to meet this team. 4. Medfield contains Medway�s Jack Kilty -- Not only did the Warriors come up with a huge win yesterday against Tri-Valley League rival Medway, they held the Mustangs� biggest offensive threat to just one goal in the 5-2 victory. Kilty did score a shorthanded goal early in the first period, but was unable to best the Warriors� defense for the rest of the contest. Kilty was the TVL�s No. 2 points leader on the season heading into Wednesday�s game so it was impressive to see the Medfield defense keep Kilty from becoming a major problem.
5. Barnstable Continues to Strengthen Super 8 Chances -- The Red Raiders maybe a member of the three-team Old Colony League, but they are a name that can�t be ignored by those in charge of choosing who makes the Super 8. They�ve tied the likes of Duxbury, Catholic Memorial and came within a shootout of knocking off the Cathedral Panthers in the Cape Cod Freeze Out tournament. Barnstable is currently on a five-game winning streak after defeating Bridgewater-Raynham 6-3 yesterday. If the Red Raiders can run the table or at least win their games against Marshfield and Winchester later this month, they might find their name called for the first time in Super 8 history.

By Alex Hall, Globe Correspondent
The Super 8 committee has some difficult decisions to make come Feb. 23 when the tournament-bound teams are announced, but consider this your personal cheat sheet to what the decision-makers will be discussing. There�s still more than two weeks of hockey left to play, but there are already several teams that are shoo-ins, with the rest still fighting to punch their ticket. Here�s an in-depth look into the definite, probable and long shot bids for the 2013 Super 8 tournament.
Definite
Springfield Cathedral Panthers
Pros: The Panthers have taken down the likes of BC High back on Jan. 12, Archbishop Williams on Dec. 22 and destroyed most of their other opponents. Cathedral is undefeated, has just two ties and has scored 79 goals through 15 games. That comes out to an average of more than five goals per game. It�s hard to beat a team when you have to score more than six goals on average to take it down.
Cons: Cathedral could use a few more big wins to solidify the No. 1 seed in the tournament, with one of its best chances to do so coming on the road against in its second meeting with BC High on Feb. 7. A season sweep of the Eagles would be huge for the Panthers and barring a loss against St. John�s Prep Feb. 16, all but ensure the tournament�s No. 1 seed.
Games remaining: Feb. 7 at BC High, Feb. 9 vs. Mt. St. Charles Academy (RI), Feb. 14 at St. John�s (S), Feb. 16 vs. St. John�s Prep, Feb. 20 vs. Needham, Feb. 21 vs. St. Mary�s or Malden Catholic (tournament game) St. John�s Prep
Pros: St. John�s Prep is close to clinching the Catholic Conference title with a 7-1 conference record and 13-2 record overall. The Eagles have been on a roll as of late, defeating Malden Catholic, BC High, Catholic Memorial, and Xaverian twice in their past six games. Upcoming games against Arlington Catholic Feb. 16 and the Cathedral game 10 days later are the biggest hurdles in the Prep�s way for the rest of the season. Regardless though, the team will in all likelihood finish either No. 1 or No. 2 in the Catholic Conference and thus make the tournament.
Cons: The Prep�s only real problem right now is the two losses, one of which came against BC High on Jan. 9. St. John�s did avenge that loss and defeat BC High in the second meeting on Jan. 26. What could derail one of the top two seeds for the Prep in the Super 8 would be a loss to either AC or Cathedral to end the year. As long as it finishes in the top two in the Catholic Conference though, the Prep will be skating in the tournament this season.
Games remaining: Feb. 6 at Arlington Catholic, Feb. 9 at St. John�s (S), Feb. 13 at Bishop Fenwick, Feb. 16 at Springfield Cathedral, Feb. 20 vs. Wakefield
BC High
Pros: The Eagles have one of the Commonwealth�s best goalies in Peter Cronin and top playmakers in Tom Besigner. It�s not often you see Besigner end a game without an assist or goal and Cronin has only surrendered more than two goals three times this season. BC High is going to be in the Super 8 and will be one of the hardest teams to score against in the field.
Cons: The Eagles were the Globe�s top ranked team for some time earlier this season but they�ve had some tough times since losing to Cathedral on Jan. 12. Coach John Flaherty�s team lost to the Prep and face off with the Panthers Feb. 7. BC High still has an outside chance at the Catholic Conference title and a top three seed in the Super 8 but it needs to get back on track starting against Cathedral at UMass-Boston this week.
Games Remaining: Feb. 7 vs. BC High, Feb. 13 at St. Mary�s Lynn, Feb. 16 vs. Duxbury (Cape Cod Classic) Feb. 22 at St. John�s (S)
Reading
Pros: First in the Middlesex League, recently crushed second place Winchester, 5-0, and has lost just one game this whole season. The Rockets have been doing their best to show the Massachusetts hockey scene they�re for real and it�s kind of hard to say they�re not right now. Cons: Lost to BC High Dec. 29 which was one of Reading�s most notable opponents all season. They score plenty of goals with 61 this season but some of the Rockets� opponents this season aren�t as strong. Reading can and should finish the season undefeated in the league though, which will be a big help seeding wise in the Super 8.
Games remaining: Feb. 4 vs. Burlington, Feb. 6 vs. Belmont, Feb. 9 at Arlington, Feb. 13 vs. Woburn, Feb. 16 at Wilmington.
Central Catholic
Pros: Rallied to tie Cathedral on Jan. 21, 8-0-1 and first in the Merrimack Valley Conference with 63 goals on the year. As long as CC wraps up the MVC, expect to see them as one of the first names announced for the Super 8.
Cons: A win against Cathedral would have been much more impressive than a tie, but the rally in the third period helps make up for that. With several tough contests left on the schedule, it�ll be interesting to see how the Raiders wind out the season, which will end up determining when and who they play in the tournament.
Games remaining: Feb. 6 at Malden Catholic, Feb. 9 at Chelmsford, Feb. 13 vs. Waltham, Feb. 16 at Andover, Feb. 18 at Catholic Memorial.
Austin Prep
Pros: The Cougars are fresh off a Feb. 2 win over Arlington Catholic, defeated Central Catholic Jan. 9 and tied CC in the second meeting. Whoever wins the Catholic Central League will be in the tournament. Austin Prep is tied with Archbishop Williams so the selection of AP as a "definite" here could just as easily have been the Archies.
Cons: Prep doesn't have much in the ways of cons but the season may very well come down to the Feb. 13 game between the Bishops and Cougars. Unless either the aforementioned teams lose before then, that's where the Catholic Central League will be decided. Games Remaining: Feb. 6 vs. Matignon, Feb. 9 at Andover, Feb. 13 vs. Archbishop Williams, Feb. 18 vs. Hingham (Cape Cod Classic)
Probable
Catholic Memorial
Pros: The Knights started the season annihilating teams, outscoring their first three opponents 15-5 to start the year. Captains Liam Coughlin and Jack O�Hear are two of the best forwards you can ask for on offense. CM beat Malden Catholic, 7-4, on Jan. 8 and defeated three days prior to that contest.
Cons: CM has lost its mental edge of late, losing to MC, St. John�s Prep, BC High and Barnstable over its past five contests. The Barnstable loss doesn�t count against the Knights� overall record but it doesn�t help win over any committee members either.
Games remaining: Feb. 9 vs. Xaverian, Feb. 16 at Braintree, Feb. 18 vs. Central Catholic, Feb. 20 at Fairfield College Prep (CT)
Braintree
Pros: Leading the Carey Division in the Bay State Conference with a 10-2 league record and wins over Weymouth and Framingham. The 2011 Super 8 tournament saw two BSC teams taken which helps the Wamps� chances of being invited to the dance.
Cons: Braintree lost to Framingham in the two teams' first meeting of the season on Jan. 5 along and picked up two losses to Division 2 Newburyport and Barnstable during the Cape Cod Freezeout tournament. Games remaining: Feb. 6 at Needham, Feb. 9 vs. Weymouth, Feb. 13 vs. Walpole, Feb. 16 vs. Catholic Memorial, Feb. 19 vs. St. Peter Marian, Feb. 21 at Brockton
Hingham
Pros: A history of Super 8 appearances and success in the tournament helps the Harbormen. The 11-5-1 record is good, not great, but the 2010 Super 8 champions have some notable games coming up to boost their record and public opinion.
Cons: Hingham took losses to almost every big name opponent this year, including St. John�s Prep, Malden Catholic, Catholic Memorial, Cathedral and tied with Reading.
Games remaining: Feb. 9 at Marshfield, Feb. 11 vs. Winchester, Feb. 16 vs. Austin Prep (Cape Cod Classic) Archbishop Williams
Pros: The Archies are tied with Austin Prep atop the Catholic Central Conference and are currently undefeated in league play, so feel free to consider them on the same level as AP. The Bishops crushed Arlington Catholic, 7-2, back on Jan. 26 after tying 1-1 earlier in the season. They also tied Austin Prep and beat Chelmsford in the Cape Cod Cup.
Cons: The Archies only chance to add another big win comes against Austin Prep on Feb. 13, though that could change if things go the Bishops� way in the Cape Cod Classic.
Games remaining: Feb. 6 vs. Bishop Fenwick, Feb. 13 at Austin Prep, Feb. 16 vs. Waltham (Cape Cod Classic)
Long Shots
Barnstable
Pros: It might be a tad unfair to call the Red Raiders a long shot considering some of their big tournament wins. Barnstable beat Braintree in the Cape Cod Freezeout consolation game after losing to Cathedral in a shootout the round prior. They also defeated Catholic Memorial in the Nate Nickerson Invitational via shootout before defeating Falmouth (ME) to win the tournament.
Cons: Other than those wins and a tie against Duxbury to start the season, there�s not a whole lot of tough competition on Barnstable�s record. Figuring in the Red Raiders have never been in the Super 8 is also something to consider.
Games remaining: Feb. 6 at Bridgewater-Raynham, Feb. 13 vs. Falmouth, Feb. 18 at Marshfield, Feb. 20 vs. Winchester (Cape Cod Hockey Showdown), Feb. 21 vs. Mansfield or Westfield (Cape Cod Hockey Showdown)
Wilmington
Pros: Division 2 Wilmington is the No. 1 team in the Middlesex League�s Freedom division, with just one loss to a division foe all year. The defending Division 2 state champion Wildcats also pulled out a big win against Winchester Jan. 26 and lost to Malden Catholic by just one goal on Jan. 14. If a Division 2 team is to make the Super 8, it could be Wilmington. The schedule proves they can play with the big boys.
Cons: Being a Division 2 team is a concern in the committee�s eyes and maybe, just maybe, Wilmington would say "thanks, but no thanks" to a Super 8 invite. But wins over Burlington and Reading to end the season might change their minds.
Games remaining: Feb. 6 vs. Melrose, Feb. 9 vs. Wakefield, Feb. 13 at Burlington, Feb. 16 vs. Reading, Feb. 18 at Acton-Boxboro, Feb. 20 vs. Tewksbury
Beverly
Pros: The Panthers have absolutely owned practically every team they�ve played this season, with a 13-0-1 record and 70 goals scored so far. The only tie came against Newburyport on the road in a 0-0 stalemate. Cons: If D2 is bad for Wilmington, then it�s worse for the Panthers. At least in the Wildcats� case, they�ve beat some big name teams like Winchester and they play in a Division 1 league. Beverly hasn�t played any top teams this year which gives them little leverage when trying to compare its resume to Wilmington�s. A good Division 2 team, it�s hard to see Beverly getting, or wanting, a bid.
Games remaining: Feb. 9 at Winthrop, Feb. 13 vs. Danvers, Feb. 16 vs. Gloucester, Feb. 18 at Peabody, Feb. 20 at Lynnfield, Feb. 22 vs. Marblehead

January 20, 2013 03:37 PM	BC High retains the No. 1 ranking after taking down two Catholic Conference rivals in Catholic Memorial and Malden Catholic this past week. Due to CM�s recent struggles against the Eagles, St. John�s Prep and Barnstable, the Knights dropped to No. 5. The Springfield Cathedral Falcons continued their winning ways this past week against St. Peter-Marian. With only one game played this week however, the Falcons couldn�t make the jump to No. 1. The team that suffered the biggest drop was Malden Catholic, which was blown out by Marshfield and then lost to BC High Saturday. The Lancers are in desperate need of righting their ship if they don�t want to continue their skid down the Top 20. Thanks to that aforementioned MC victory by Marshfield, the Rams made their way into the Top 20 this week. The team also knocked off Sandwich last week seven days after they blew out Dennis-Yarmouth, 7-2.
The notables who just missed out on the Top 20 this week are Xaverian, Newburyport and Braintree. The Hawks were bumped out from last week due to Marshfield�s win while the Clippers and Wamps just missed the cut this week.

October 21, 2012 12:50 PM	Three teams dropped from the ranks of the undefeated as Weymouth, Acton-Boxboro and Winchester all got their first taste of defeat this season.
That gives us four remaining teams without a loss, so let us praise them for a second, shall we?
Top-ranked Masconomet (12-0-2) is seemingly getting stronger with each game, which was the way they did things last year en route to a Division 1 EMass title. No. 2 Somerville (13-0-2) seems to be scoring at will since the arrival of Felix DeBona, as the field has opened up into junior Thayrone Miranda�s playground.
Underrated Hingham (10-0-3) has quietly dispatched of most everyone in its path, save from a few draws along the way, and have forced their way into the top 10, coming in at No. 9 this week.
Lastly, the Red Devils of Chelsea, our first new team in the Top 20 in three weeks, debut at No. 20 with a 11-0-1 mark on the season thanks to an offense that is averaging 4.1 goals per game.

Football is back in Boston.
And Monday's opening day of training camp marked major new beginnings at several city league programs. Besides being the first day of practice for new coaches at Brighton High, Charlestown High and West Roxbury High, Monday was the first ever football practice for New Mission High.
New Mission secured a football program after it was announced last school year that the school would move from Mission Hill to the former Hyde Park Education Complex. About 13 New Mission students participated in practice at Ross Field on Monday. �This is surreal,� said New Mission coach Michael Pittman Forman, who used to coach at Cathedral High in the South End. �I�ve been in Boston for a while and I�ve wanted to get into the city [league] and coach. It feels surreal and I�m happy for the turnout we have right now. It�s a little low but we should be getting more guys.�
Known for their formidable basketball teams, the Titans looked athletic as they ran through conditioning drills on Monday morning. �Once we start running with helmets and shoulder pads we�ll see if they are football players,� Pittman Forman said. �I have a feeling it�s going to be great. Everything starts with baby steps and we�re taking baby steps right now. We�ll see how it goes from this point on.�
Over in West Roxbury, another new era of football started as Derek Wright was in place as head coach instead of Leo Sybertz. The 74-year-old retired after the 2007 season only to return for the 2010 and 2011 seasons.
Wright served as Sybertz' assistant for two seasons. �It was a restless night, the anxiety, now it�s all on my shoulders to be the head guy,� Wright said. The Raiders junior quarterback David Bertucci said it was strange without Sybertz at practice on Monday. �But I�ve been with these coaches since I was a freshman and I love them all to death,� he said. �But you can�t really replace a coach Sy, it�s always tough. Coach Wright coached me since JV year so I�ve been under his tutelage. It�s always good working with a coach you�ve worked with before. It makes everything easier. I�m happy they made Coach Wright head coach, I wouldn�t want anyone else to be head coach.� Bertucci also said it�s a little tough coming back to practice and conditioning because it means summer is over and school is about to start. �But the football helps to remove that pit [in your stomach] and makes everything better,� said Buertucci, whose father played at Westie in the 1980s and is an assistant for the Raiders. �I�m just happy to be back. I�ve been waiting for this since the last game of the year last year against Brighton. We finished off strong and we have a good group of guys here and we�re hoping to go deep in the playoffs.�
At Brighton�s camp in Cleveland Circle on Monday, longtime Bengals� assistant Randolph Abraham officially took over the reins from James �Timo� Philip, who retired last year after coaching the Bengals for 30 years. Abraham played for Philip until 2000 and became his assistant coach after graduating from Nichole�s College in 2004.
�It feels awesome, this is a dream of mine, I�ve wanted to do since I was a student here,� he said. �It�s going to be a grind but I think we�ve got great coaching.� Last week Abraham joked that he wouldn�t be surprised if Philip turned up at the first day of practice. While Philip was a no show on Monday, Abraham joked that Philip would "hate" how organized practice is. �He likes to roll with it,� Abraham said of Philip. �Me, I�m the opposite. We�re very organized and precise as you can see. We�re getting a lot done today. It feels like we�ve been here for four hours but we�ve only been here for two. They�re working.� During the first week of Brighton�s practice last year, Brighton's star tight end Prince Unaegbu suffered a dislocating wrist and played most of the season with a cast on his forearm. �It feels good, I�ve been waiting all year for this," the 6-foot-6, 240-pounder said. "When I came in today it felt like I was getting ready for a game or something.� Justin A. Rice covers Boston Public school athletics. He can be reached at jrice.globe@gmail.com.
