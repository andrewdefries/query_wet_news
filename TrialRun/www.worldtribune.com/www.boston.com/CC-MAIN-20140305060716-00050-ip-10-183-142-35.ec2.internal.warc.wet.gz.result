THE HILLS are alive with the sound of liberal Democratic contempt for the electorate. So are the valleys, the prairies, and the coasts. For months, voters have been signaling their discontent with the president, his party, and their priorities; in less than a week, they appear poised to deliver a stinging rebuke.

it would not shock me if the sox swooped in with a gonzo-type deal for albert for about 5 years to serve as the primary DH. dont forget he can also play some third base and be the emergency first baseman if gonzo went down. lets run through the numbers. it will cost about $14m per year to bring back ortiz for at least 2 years. talking about 29m and likely a vesting option for year 3. slump or not, i love ortiz but as a right-handed hitter in our dominant lefty line up, pujols offers more value (at less than 10m more per year) and is still a better overall hitter than david. plus if you free him from the confines of st. louis and that pitcher-friendly ball park,as with gonzo he too should THRIVE! for pujols, it would be better than going across the street to the cubs for his long term legacy. kind of like ortiz going to the yanks on his own. downside is that ortiz would likely end up in NY for 2 years until a-rod and jeter are total liabilities in the field. crawford likely will be in the 5 hole behind pujols with youk hitting sixth. or knowing tito, he may hit pujols sixth. either way, craw gets moved to fifth.
