Boston Globe baseball writer Gordon Edes checks in every week (usually on Wednesdays or Thursdays) to answer your questions on the Red Sox. Ask yours now, and come back next week to see if it was answered.Why is Francona insisting on keeping Coco at leadoff when we were a first place team with Youk batting first? Can someone find out what the records are with both? I got to believe Youk's is around 50 wins, 30 losses and Crisp's is 15 W's and 23 L's! I don't want to hear about protecting Manny when Lowell batted fifth almost all season! Daniel Doyle, SpringfieldA:Daniel, I just happen to have those numbers at hand. The Sox are 49-32 when Youkilis leads off, 19-16 when Coco is in the top spot. In a perfect world, Tito would no doubt opt for Youkilis's high on-base percentage, although in reality, he'd happily have Coco lead off if he played the way he did in the series finale against the Tigers, collecting a couple of hits, dropping a big sacrifice bunt, delivering a Wall-Ball double. But with Trot Nixon, the only player who has been effective in the 5-hole, out with his biceps injury, Youkilis is the only option to bat behind Papi and Manny in the order, and the numbers support him. Mike Lowell? He's batting just .102 (5 for 49) when he has been in the 5-hole, with no home runs or RBIs. Perhaps in time, with more plate discipline, Wily Mo Pena would be an option, but not yet. Jason Varitek, when he come back, could also be reinstalled there-he was showing signs after the break of coming out of his offensive struggles, but for now, Youk's the one.What has the Sox record been since Youkilis moved to the 5th spot? The Sox have had success all season with Youkilis leading off, why not return to that? Don't Lowell and Wily Mo provide enough coverage for Manny? If Youkilis and Loretta continue to get on base as they have all season, it becomes that much harder to pitch around Papi and Manny regardless of who hits behind them. Joe Korostynski, Knightdale, N.C.A: Joe, this is obviously a question much on the minds of Sox fans. The Sox are 6-8 when Youk hits in the 5-hole-compared to 40-23 when Nixon is hitting fifth. The best thing that could happen at this stage is if Coco, who admits he's had a streaky season, could go on a run in the last six weeks and be a disruptive force at the top of the order. We know the Coco-Johnny Damon comparisons will be a popular subplot this weekend. But the Sox do need a way to force teams to pitch to Manny, and Youkilis is the best option right now. Interesting, by the way, that teams this season prefer to take their chances with Papi than Manny. Ortiz leads the league in intentional walks with 18; Manny has 8.
Here is a change up: Coco isn't the best outfielder on the defensive side but he has great speed. So if he can't play great defense or lead off then why not trade him in the offseason for pitching and sign Nixon and put Pena in center field. Pena reminds me of the year that the Sox had Jeremy Giambi and Kevin Millar splitting time with David Ortiz. If the Sox are letting Lester Hanson and Delcarmen pitch why not play Pena everyday? If he struggles at least he will be hidden behind Manny and Ortiz... Wh
