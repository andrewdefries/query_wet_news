WORCESTER - Picture an Abstract Expressionist artist, and chances are you see a painter flinging, splashing, and athletically brushing paint on a canvas. Spontaneity and improvisation are hallmarks of Abstract Expressionism, and painting can be a deliciously immediate process. Printmaking, because it requires more steps and results in a mirror image of the one on the printing plate, demands forethought. It's not a medium ordinarily associated with Abstract Expressionism.Indeed, at the time this artistic movement rose to prominence, printmaking

Thanks Med. We made up our minds last night and we have to do what's best in the end, think with our heads and not our hearts. The only good thing I can is that according to my insurance policy, this doesn't get in the way of the year they told us to wait before they would cover us for IVF...supposedly. I have a call into RE to make an appointment and also to confirm with someone who I am sure has dealt with situations like ours to make sure this isn't wrong. There isn't anything in the medical policy language that has an stipulations about how a loss occurs. It doesn't change anything about our decision but it's something at least. We took a gamble and lost. We'll just have to try again. "I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs"

Hi Ladies, I haven't posted for a long time and have only lurked a handful of times in the past few months. Northern, I'm so sorry you have to make this heartbreaking decision. I also had to make such a decision this past June. At our 12 week scan they discovered many physical malformations. These were the result of a condition called trisomy 13, and it was very unusual that I didn't miscarry as this condition is incompatible with life. Even though it was a very black and white diagnosis, the decision to terminate a much wanted pregnancy was devistating. All of my doctors and counselors were so supportive, I do not know how I would have gotten through it without them. Those first few weeks after diagnosis and termination were very difficult, but it was the best decision for the baby, myself and my family. I could not bear to carry a baby who would struggle and die, and I didn't want to put my older children (2yo and 3yo) through that either. They both never knew I was pregnant and don't need to learn about death just yet. DH and I knew that our family still wasn't complete and we decided to try again. I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant. I'm very hopeful that this is a healthy pregnancy. My genetics counselor has told me that my risk is the same as the general population and does not increase since I had a previous trisomy pregnancy. Northern: PM me if you want to talk to someone who has been through it. I also can recommend the counselor I used who specializes in termination for medical reasons. I hope everyone else is well.

Well the celtics have begun the campaign for their final invitees and the candidates are all Sf's or SG's: Adam Morrison has been in for two workouts and has been joined by Rashard McCants,Cuttino Mobley and Trent Hassell. The are all NBA players who are presently without employment and they all represent a definate skill level. So who do all of you guys want the Celtics to bring in a compete with West,Harangody and Erdan for one of the final spots on the roster?

McCants could work, but if Danny is looking for shooters, why not Morrison...I know he cannot defend but...

In Response to Re: Workouts for an invitation to camp:[QUOTE]Out of these 4 guys along with West Wafer and Erdan..I would first cut Erdan..and would like to have McCants as he is bigger than West at 6'4 and younger than both Mobley and Hassel..TA was only 6'4 and was hellish on offense..Not sure about McCants defense..however the Celts play a team defense..and any points he gives up he can get back on offense...Posted by BBALLIQ[/QUOTE] Interesting points in referencing McCants and his offensive abilities, I think they are looking for a defensive player first and a guy who can hold his own offensively. before they signed Wafer, I was pushing for them to give McCants a shot based upon his familiarity with KG, but I think Hassell may have played with KG in Minny also, Morrison intrigues me just because he was a solid player at Gonzaga and Cuttino Mobley can flat out score! All of these guys are unique in their abilities and could easily make this team. As far as Erdan is concerned he has the talent but it is very raw as NBA standards are concerned. However he did comport himself very well in the FIBA championship games. He already can rebound with the NBA bigs,the question is his offensive skills and what they are or will be in 2 years.

In response to dapats1281's comment:[QUOTE] Mayo is above average, but definitely not great. He is pretty bad in coverage and isn't a playmaker. "Steady" would be the word I would use to describe him That being said, if you asked me to pick between Spikes or Mayo, I'd pick Spikes. I don't think tackles is a good stat to measure how good a linebacker is. Tackles to missed tackles ratio would be more telling. Spikes makes big plays in big moments though. I'd probably vote him over Mayo [/QUOTE]I'll take both . I think they complement each other. The steady mayo frees up spikes to make his more aggressive plays while taking some risks... Sometimes it's just impossible to rank players but I'll take the guy who leads the league in tackles. Any of you who think tackling NFL backs is easy (making the stat misleading or less important) are mistaken IMO... This post has been removed.

I hope the debate isn't centered around that one dude who made that thread declaring that he expects a top ten pick to be in the HOF or he's not that good. Those kinds of expectations are absurd. But I guess they wouldn't make pink hats if there wasn't a market for them.

After watching the Pats try to fill in scrubs like Monty Beisel, Chad Brown, Eric Alexander, Tully Banta Cain, and Adalius Thomas following the departure of our marquee Super Bowl linebacker squad, it is a great relief to see someone like Mayo playing linebacker for the Pats.

Crawford will not make spring debut Thursday
Though he was scheduled to, Carl Crawford (elbow) will not make his Cactus League debut on Thursday.
The Dodgers are pulling back the reins a bit on Crawford's spring program. It's nothing to worry about quite yet. The 31-year-old outfielder remains a high-risk, high-reward fantasy option for the 2013 season.
