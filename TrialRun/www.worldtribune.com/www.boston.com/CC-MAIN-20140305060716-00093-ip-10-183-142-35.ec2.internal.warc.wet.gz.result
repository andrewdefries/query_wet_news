NFL.com's Ian Rapoport reports Patriots RB/KR Jeff Demps has "informed the Pats he's returning to track, but wants to play two sports."
It's bizarre timing, as the Rio Olympics are over three years away. We doubt Bill Belichick will be sympathetic to a player wanting to divide his time between two sports, meaning Demps could be told to take a hike. The former Florida Gator's three-year deal included $211,000 guaranteed, all of which has already been paid. It's possible Demps finagled a clause in last summer's negotiations that would allow him to keep running, but unlikel
Can't see BB being down with this. Not like this guy is Bo Jackson, he still needs to do a lot of work to improve as a football player. Any time spent on track might detract time from the Patriots.

Afternoon all...just a little different take on Frankie boy's assessment of the two teams...given all that was said and written about both teams..the Sox looking to turn the page on an admittedly horrid 2012 and the Yanks constantly battled questions about age, lack of lineup power and pitching, actually both teams pitching was called into question at some points during the offseason..entering the month of May finds the Sox and Yanks occupying the top 2 spots in the ALE, the Sox getting strong pitching and hitting, great starts from Lester and Buchholz, strong offense from Napoli, Nava, Pedroia and the returning Ortiz, Yanks battling in the face of injuries to 5 of their starting postions are getting power from a few of the signings that Cashman was roundly criticized for, along with solid pitching and strong BP work...all in all though things could swing in the other direction, i think it's safe to say, we can agree both teams are beating the early expectations of what was said and written...

As far as DIY gifts go this holiday season, infused salt and flavored salt recipes have to be in the top five most popular. Not only are infused salts super quick and easy to make, but they're versatile and thoughtful when blended with a friend's favorite flavors and prettily packaged.
If you're looking for a last-minute DIY gift to make for Christmas presents with only one or two days to go, try making one of our all-time favorite infused salt recipes: Sriracha salt.
Inspired by recent release The Sriracha Cookbook: 50 "Rooster Sauce" Recipes that Pack a Punch, from chef-author Randy Clemens in California, we've been making batches of this spicy salt all year long to rave reviews from friends and family members. Sriracha is also having its year, thanks to a cult following that now includes everyone from online comic The Oatmeal to, well, every chef ever. (Clemens' cookbook is currently sold out in practically every bookstore.) And, really, who doesn't love spicy food � or a simple salt that makes any food spic

US nuclear energy gets more scrutiny

The Obama administration’s push for construction of nuclear power plants, financed with taxpayer-backed loan guarantees, faces new uncertainty in the wake of the Japanese disaster and new questions about safety of such facilities.The crisis in Japan could also stir debate about whether to lengthen the lifetimes of two nuclear power plants in New England, politicians and environmentalists say.Yesterday, some leading politicians took to Sunday talk shows and other venues to say that the Japanese crisis should prompt at least a pause in the US effort to restart the country’s nuclear industry, if not put an end to the attempt.Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, said Japan’s crisis illustrates why the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, near Brattleboro, should not operate after next year. The day before Japan’s earthquake, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission extended the plant’s license for 20 years beyond 2012, when its original license was set to expire.“We act as if they can be run beyond their design life, when the engineering is primitive compared to what one would build today,’’ he said. “I think the tragedy in Japan should awaken a reexamination of our irrational exuberance about running our aging plants beyond their design life.’’Laurence Smith, a spokesman for Vermont Yankee’s owner, Entergy Corp., declined to comment on the governor’s statement, saying “he’s free to say whatever he wants.’’ But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s review shows the plant is safe, he said.“We’re not going to have a tsunami on the Connecticut River in Vernon, Vermont,’’ he said.Pilgrim Nuclear Station in Plymouth, which is also owned by Entergy Corp. and has also requested a 20-year extension, was cited by the NRC this month for an unspecified low to moderate security problem.Both plants have the same containment design as does the most critically compromised Japanese reactor.Until last week’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the nuclear industry had hoped the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear disasters were distant memories to politicians and the public. The industry, and the Obama administration, had worked to convince the public — and even some prominent environmentalists — that new reactors are a critical component of fighting global warming because they do not release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.The Nuclear Energy Commission has requests for 22 new reactors, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group.With costs to build a reactor anywhere from $6 billion to $10 billion, the federal government has stepped in to help finance them. The government has offered a loan guarantee for a proposed plant in Georgia, and President Obama has requested an additional $36 billion in loan guarantees in his proposed 2012 budget, in addition to $18.5 billion already allotted.
Even nuclear industry critics say it is too early to tell what effect Japan’s crisis will have on US policy, but they predicted it will at least spark a reexamination about whether a fail-safe nuclear plant is possible.“The nuclear enterprise rests on public faith the industry and regulators know what they are doing,’’ said Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. When a mishap occurs at a nuclear plant, “the more fundamental [message] that seeps into the public consciousness is that something happened that they were assured would not happen.’’US Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, a leading Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the events in Japan should spur the Obama administration to review its position on nuclear power, including a “complete reevaluation’’ of the loan guarantees. He also said there should be a moratorium on new plants.“They have to call a timeout and go back and review all of the safety requirements at nuclear power plants in our country, especially the adequacy of the backup power systems, and I believe they also need to reevaluate the economic feasibility of nuclear power in the light of the catastrophe,’’ he said.But Tom Kauffman, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, said it is premature to discuss Japan’s impact on the United States until more is learned about what went wrong. He said there are multiple backup systems at nuclear plants.“Keep in mind the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates and monitors and ensures these plants are in top condition’’ and are built to withstand and exceed any local natural event, Kauffman said. He said US plants have had a “superb safety record and performance’’ in the last 30 years.Some specialists say the industry’s revival effort was already in trouble because of the astronomically high costs of building reactors and a recession that weakened energy demand. The decreasing price of natural gas also has made nuclear energy less competitive. And the failure of Congress to pass climate-change legislation, which might have increased the costs of carbon-producing sources such as coal-fired plants, has hurt the nuclear industry’s ability to sell itself as a power generator that does not add to global warming.“The nuclear renaissance is not in trouble right now because of what happened in Japan,’’ said Ellen Vancko, senior energy adviser for the Cambridge-based Union of Concerned Scientists. “It is in trouble because of economics.’’Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, said the administration’s first priority is to support Japan and any Americans there, while monitoring the situation and providing assistance. But the administration “is committed to learning from [Japan’s disaster] and ensuring that nuclear energy is produced safely and responsibly,’’ he said.Senator Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who chairs the Senate Homeland Security committee, stopped short of calling for a moratorium, but said the United States should reevaluate plans for new plants.“I’ve been a big supporter of nuclear power because it’s domestic, it’s ours, and it’s clean,’’ Lieberman said on CBS-TV’s “Face the Nation.’’“I don’t want
