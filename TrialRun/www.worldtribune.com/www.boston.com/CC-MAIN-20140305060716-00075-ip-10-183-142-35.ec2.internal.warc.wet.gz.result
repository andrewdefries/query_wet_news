The thing that makes my family's Thanksgiving unique is that I always cook the turkey over a wood fire in my outdoor stone oven.We make lots of things indoors too, but that smokey tender turkey really makes it all special.

okay, I can't tell if that is sarcasm or not... but 13 goals is 4th best on the team, who do you think will make up the difference?

I do not have the link but I recalled either in a conversation on ESPN or an article that this is the 3rd year with Miami's BIG 3, LeBron, Wade & Bosh. We won a title with our BIG 3 and came within minutes & overcoming an egregious difference in gift foul shots(41 to 17) vs the Lakers in Game 7 of winning another. The comment was that LeBron & Wade just don't really complement eachother & the team might play better with Wade gone and if they don't win a title this year, Wade could be traded. There are times when I find Wade as close to Kobe, especially when younger, in Avatar athletic shots. So, definitely, not a Michael Jordan, but in the class category of a Rose and Westbrook for sure.The problem is I really like the guard combo of Rondo and A. Bradley going forward & they could turn out to be one of the best back court duos in the game. Wade, of course is a guard but can he play Small Forward when those two are playing and revert to guard when Rondo or Bradley is out.Comments ???

Ed Hochuli will be either fired or quit in the next 2 years.Seriously he is one of the worst refs in the league right now and we got stuck with the bum in a primetime game.Theres a photo of Goodell talking with the refs after the game.

Hochuli is the poster boy for why the NFL needs to employ full time professional officials. Proof that the league values image over substance.

Why would a referee who resides in the State of Wisconson be allowed to referee a Green Bay Packers game in the first place? Leave it to the NFL to try and break the Patriots roll as they are dominating opponents who are supposed to be their equals! BB and his team are starting to walk away from the league again,and the NFL is all about parity. It was very disappointing to watch Hockuli and his band of Merrimen take from the rich and give to the poor,his hometown Green Bay Packers!!!!! Call me a whiner or any other name you like, but I'm calling a cheater a cheater and Ed Hockuli is just that a cheater!

In Response to Re: Ed Hochuli Throws a Late Flag After Watching Jumbotron?:[QUOTE]It is a very troubling precedent to allow officials to watch replays and then have a conference after a play on which no flag was thrown. But I wouldn't expect to hear any more about this. Take your cue from the broadcast . . . After the play, Collinsworth was praising McCourty for understanding what is an acceptable hit and what is not . . . then, after the conference and the retro-active flag, Collinsworth alomst fell on as his @ss backpedaling: "On second look, there is helmet-to-helmet contact. He didn't launch, but . . . blah, blah, blah . . . excuse, excuse . . . " The league will stand behind this nonsense 100%, if it even gets brought up at all . . . which I doubt.Posted by p-mike[/QUOTE]Collinsworth is a complete idiot.

In Response to Re: Ed Hochuli Throws a Late Flag After Watching Jumbotron?:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: Ed Hochuli Throws a Late Flag After Watching Jumbotron? : Hochuli is SOOOOO bad that he continues to get plumb post season officiating gigs, which are awarded after grading each game by the league. I'll buy that, and throw in that swamp land in the Sonora desert, the snow capped mountain in Kansas, and that certain bridge in NYC that has been bought/sold millions of times over the years. The NFL is no different than any other professional league. Refs all have different ways of doing their jobs. Do you think batters in MLB don't know what a certain home plate umpire's strike zone is BEFORE the game starts (I beklieve it's called "scouting"). How about hockey refs that allow the teams to "play", while others button things down? NBA refs? If you want to find issues, THAT'S where you need to develop your conspiricy theories, especially seeing the imprisonment of the yahoo who admitted to throwing games. If teh Pats draw Hochuli int eh pst season,a nd they probably will meet uo with him, they need to learn from last night's game. "Play stupid, be stupid, lose stupid."Posted by AZPAT[/QUOTE] Don't you mean if they run into him in a game the mantra will be :I'll cheat you,I'll cheat you,I'll cheat you everytime?

In response to rkarp's comment: In response to southpaw777's comment: In response to rkarp's comment: I posted this on the Pats board. Sub Arod for Ray Lewis and MLB for NFL Lets relook at the facts. HGH and steroids are miracle drugs that used under doctors supervision can be a huge benefit to the NFL in the recovery and comeback from injury and the usual week to week NFL grind. If teams monitored usage safely, and not some underground supplier, players could greatly benefit. does "deer antler" extract have any adverse effects? Does I t really help? Did Ray Lewis come back from a potential season ending injury because of this extract? If he did, shouldn't the NFL be trying to help the players get healthier faster? Prather than ignore the fact, hide it under the rug, or simply ban it, I prefer the NFL to embrace it to help players recover and comeback, as long as there are no adverse effects. very good point. I really havent looked at it that way, but it does make some sense. No sense in boring you with the fact that I have been inhaling steroids for 20 years under doctors supervision to superbly control asthma. Surely professional sports can find ways to use these drugs to improve players health. Corticosteroids for asthma control are completely different from anabolic steroids that are PEDs.

I believe in the early 2000's that 80% of players took PEDs at some point during their careers. I think that number is down to about 60%. The big difference is that then they took the drugs 24-7. Now they take them in a more timely fashion. Between tests, causing reduced benefits. I think 95% of football players, 80% of hockey players and even 30% of golfers and basketball players have taken PEDs during the last decade. Its sad that sports has been manipulated by these drugs to the point where its hard to compete without taking them.

In response to georom4's comment: if NFL players get any faster and stronger, they will have to outlaw tackling soon - the human body simply cant withstand 260 lb men crashing into you with the speed of a bullet train sometimes you just have to say no to "progress" / science we can still have great athletes and dynamic competition without drugging our players - a lifetime ban for anyone caught using PEDs would end this nonsense once and for all and restore integrity to the game - if not they really will have to build a special PED wing in Cooperstown Agree 100 percent.

In response to Beantowne's comment: In response to rkarp's comment: Great post. My son is a college prospect down here in Florida. He has never takin anything other than protein drinks. But I can tell you that on his college team...RIGHT NOW, that most of the kids use at his school.what is worse, while playing in high school, a lot of his peers, throughout the state, we're using then also. WITH....the parents full knowledge. It is so easy to get, and I , in fact was asked just 2 weeks ago if I needed any testosterone cream for my son. The preasure is so great for these kids. The difference between throwing 88/90 or 92/93 as an 18 yr old can mean an awful lot to your draft status. Future health is not even being considered I can assure you I posted this on the Pats board. Sub Arod for Ray Lewis and MLB for NFL Lets relook at the facts. HGH and steroids are miracle drugs that used under doctors supervision can be a huge benefit to the NFL in the recovery and comeback from injury and the usual week to week NFL grind. If teams monitored usage safely, and not some underground supplier, players could greatly benefit. does "deer antler" extract have any adverse effects? Does I t really help? Did Ray Lewis come back from a potential season ending injury because of this extract? If he did, shouldn't the NFL be trying to help the players get healthier faster? Prather than ignore the fact, hide it under the rug, or simply ban it, I prefer the NFL to embrace it to help players recover and comeback, as long as there are no adverse effects. I don't know that I agree with "supervised use". At the end of the day the players all are using under doctors supervision...just not a doctor that's sanctioned by the league. Without going in to a prolonged polyanic diatribe (which I'm prone to do)...It's already been established by the medical community that use of anabolic steriods has long term health risk. The greater the use, the greater the risk. If one think's of the human body as an eco system. Increasing the amount of toxins that are released into the system. Just like the increased CO2 emmisions have on the planets atmoshere. Ulitamately when the balance is out of order the system breaks down and what was the norm becomes the exception and chaos ensues. At some point the planet as it has over the milliniums self corrects and the temperature plummets and the city of Boston will find itself under a couple of hundred feet of ice. Another Ice age is not a question of if bu

Why wouldn't that same GM who tossed out the name of a young Dman like Krug, etc. (assuming he did) not ask for a similar price from teams like the Flyers and Canadiens who did not have to pay it and more »

No, they're not any worse, but virtually every playoff bound team around them got better. By staying at their same level, that makes the Bruins weaker. I wouldn't be complaining if I hadn't seen other more »

Did Philly "blow up their team" acquiring McDonald, a vastly superior D-man than Meszaros? Did Montreal blow up their team to acquire one of the best forwards available, and more to the point, a prove

Thats kind of disapointing. I expected Barnes-Workman and Ranaudo to have just missed. However, based on those numbers, it looks like none of them would have cracked the top 125 even. And Vasquez woul more »
