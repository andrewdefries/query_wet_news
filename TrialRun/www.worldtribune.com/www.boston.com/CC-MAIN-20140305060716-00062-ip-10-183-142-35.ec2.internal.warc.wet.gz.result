I think it was ment as a joke when he praised Neely then said "nice to see him help bring us a cup something he didn't do when he was wearing skates". Truly bad taste expecialy since JJ was the main reason Cam and Ray never got a cup here in their playing days due to his order to Sinden to be penny pinchers an not spend on payroll. Since there has been a cap in the NHL JJ can't be accused of being cheap as the bruins have spent to almost the max every year. I just didn't find the shot at cam funny even if it was ment as a joke.

he shoulders much of the blame for the drought and was the reason i didn't follow the b's as loyally as i did in the late eighties and through much of the nineties. i lost hope that under his ownership we would ever see a title. the thornton trade cut me deep too. i agree, i didn't find it funny either-as you stated to his credit he has not held back $$. he was getting much flack on the radio.

I agree. That poke at Cam made no sense. If it came from one of his peers it might have been funny, but I don't see how you can derive humor out of blaming someone else for your own shrewdness. I just don't see the puchline there. And Cam clearly didn't find it amusing.Very poor taste from an even more distasteful man.Link

It was a poorly delivered joke...no big deal. And without the Tornton trade, ther is no Cup in Boston in 2011.

Its offical Sox have landed Vitorinio with a Three year deal per Alex spear Of weei Radio. The deal is said to include 38 million dollars of guarenteed money. Obviously its a little bit of an over pay but its on a short term basis.

Not a good signing in my opinion. Victorino can't hit and seems to be declining.

Priest differs with Law testimony
By Wendy Davis, Globe Correspondent, 3/12/2003
he Rev. Eugene O'Sullivan, sent to serve as a priest in New Jersey after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old altar boy in Massachusetts, appeared to contradict prior testimony of Cardinal Bernard Law about the reason for the transfer, in a pre-trial deposition released yesterday.
When Law was deposed last June, he testified that O'Sullivan was sent to the diocese of Metuchen, N.J., in 1985 both to avoid a scandal resulting from publicity due to the criminal case and because he had relatives in that state. ''He had family in New Jersey, which is important in terms of support to the priest himself,'' testified Law.
But O'Sullivan, who was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty in 1984 to having sex with the altar boy from his parish in Arlington, testified this January that his family was in Boston, not New Jersey.
He added that he requested an assignment in New Jersey because it was close enough to home that he could return frequently. For the seven years he was in Metuchen, he came to Boston once a month to see his family and probation officer. O'Sullivan was recalled to Boston in 1992 and was placed on sick leave. He retired two years later.
O'Sullivan, a St. John Seminary classmate of the Revs. Paul R. Shanley, Joseph E. Birmingham, and Bernard J. Lane -- all accused of molesting minors -- was deposed as a witness in the civil lawsuit brought by several alleged victims. The plaintiffs say the church and its leaders should not have reassigned priests who allegedly molested youngsters to new parishes where they continued to have contact with children.
O'Sullivan acknowledged
