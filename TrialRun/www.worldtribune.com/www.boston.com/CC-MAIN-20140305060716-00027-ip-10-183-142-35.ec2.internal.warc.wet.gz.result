WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court’s conservative justices raised concerns Tuesday that President Obama’s health care law could open the door for the government to compel Americans to participate in all sorts of commerce, including the mandated purchase of cellphones, gym memberships, even burial insurance.The justices’ probing questions during the second day of hearings over the constitutionality of Obama’s signature health care overhaul served to jolt the law’s supporters from any certitude that the court would find the requirement to have health insurance does not trample on individual rights.“The reason this is concerning is because it requires the individual to do an affirmative act,’’ said Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Republican appointee who is seen as a key swing vote. “Here the government is saying that the federal government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act, and that is different from what we have in previous cases and that changes the relationship of the federal government to the individual in the very fundamental way.’’The heated, at times combative exchanges spanned two hours, twice the length of normal Supreme Court arguments, highlighting the case’s historical importance. At the crux of Tuesday’s debate was whether Congress has the power to require nearly all individuals to have insurance starting in 2014, and whether it has the right to assess a financial penalty for those who refuse.MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, an architect of Massachusetts’ ground-breaking health care law that made it the first state to require individuals to have insurance, said the tone of the justices’ questions left him pessimistic about the federal law’s future.“It was not a good day. Not a good day for fans of the mandate,’’ said Gruber, who directs the health care program at the National Bureau of Economic Research and who advised Obama on the federal law. “I’m just not as confident as I was four or five hours ago.’’Other observers said the tone of the questions did not preclude one or more of the conservative justices joining the court’s four liberals in upholding the law.Twenty-six states and an independent business group are suing the government on the basis that the mandate threatens individual liberty by forcing people who are not insured by their employer, Medicare, or Medicaid into the insurance market.The government argues that everyone is already in the health care market, which makes up nearly 18 percent of the economy, because everyone will need health care at some point in their lives. The mandate is necessary, the government says, to buttress the key provisions of health reform - that insurers cannot discriminate against applicants with preexisting medical conditions or charge elders and the sickly prohibitively high rates for coverage.
Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., representing the government, said more than 40 million uninsured Americans do not have access to affordable health insurance in part because insurers have been able to discrimi
