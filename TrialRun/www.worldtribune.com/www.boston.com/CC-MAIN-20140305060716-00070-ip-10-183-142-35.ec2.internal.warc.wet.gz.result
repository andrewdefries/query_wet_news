No matter what goes in during OT, no matter what garbage rebouds end up in the net, no matter how crazy flopping goes on while another one goes in, TT continues to get a complete pass no matter what.Rask gets crucified on this board after an ordinary game when they score 1 goal and two 2-0 leads get blown in 24 hours with all sorts of questionable goals and it just doesn't matter. Just wow.But, he'll go on NESN with his list of excuses and all the fanboys will lap it up while they talk about his stats as usual and continue to let him live off of a couple good months a long time ago. He's been pretty ordinary for quite some time now.

Don't want to be a dink but Thomas season stats are pretty good. They dude got outplayed tonight by Montoya no doubt, but it's not like he didn't give the B's an opportunity to win. Not disagreeing with you Sox just stating the facts.

The snipes are out. Two mis-played fly balls by our new OF cost us the runs. We wouldn't have even been in the game if it not for BV running for Ortiz The offense sucked. Of course Veralander WAS on the mound.

In Response to Re: I Miss Tito Already:[QUOTE]This one is clearly on Cherington, not Valentine. Morales was OK, but couldn't prevent the sac fly by Fielder. Aceves and Melancon were both awful. So far the bullpen stinks. Great comeback by the hitters, who made it an exciting game. Posted by maxbialystock[/QUOTE]Fielder is a top-tier hitter. It isn't a question of why didn't Morales strike him out, it is why did he pitch to Fielder at all? I didn't have much issue with the way the BP was handled. The hits off of Melancon weren't hit hard, and the HBP was a borderline swing.But why choose to pitch to Fielder instead of Young? There is a substantially gap between them.

WHITEY & THE FBI
Part 4: The price of protection
Cases disappear as FBI looks away
By Shelley Murphy, Globe Staff, 7/22/1998
This Spotlight Team 5-part series was prepared by editor Gerard O'Neill and reporters Dick Lehr, Mitchell Zuckoff, and Shelley Murphy. THE SERIES
Part 1:Agent, mobster forge a pact on old Southie ties
 The myths of 'Whitey' Bulger
 Connolly disputes sworn testimony
Part 2:Agents gave Bulger starring role in Mafia case
 Flemmi's double-dealing career worthy of master spy
Part 3:The official Bulger FBI files: some tall tales
 Bulger's path from King of Southie to King Rat
Part 4:Cases disappear as FBI looks away
 Law enforcement officials change their tune
 Howie Winter never saw Bulger coming
Part 5:FBI in denial as Bulger breaks drug pact in Southie
 Bulger's drug dealings were the talk of the 'town'
 Next up: What will Flemmi say?
At the dawn of his deal with the FBI, James ``Whitey'' Bulger was an angry
leg breaker at a Dedham restaurant looking to collect an unpaid loan. Leaning
across a table, he gave the owner a choice: Pay, or have his ears cut off and
stuffed in his mouth.
Restaurateur Francis X. Green told his story to the FBI, expecting
protection and prosecution. But Bulger had an ace in the hole. He worked for
the FBI.
Looking back, the 1976 incident at the Back Side Restaurant was a turning
point. An extortion case, built on a credible, cooperative witness, might have
stopped Bulger and his partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, from
launching a 15-year crime spree. Instead, the FBI did nothing, sending a powerful message to two of the
region's most ruthless organized crime figures: As long as you're with us, we
won't bother you.
As a result, Bulger and Flemmi became sanctioned career criminals while
spying on the underworld for the FBI. Despite solid evidence indicating Bulger
and Flemmi were involved in murders, shakedowns, and drug dealing, the FBI
looked the other way throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
It made no difference who the victims were, fellow wise guys or innocent
people. And it didn't matter if the victims were willing to cooperate with the
FBI or were scared silent. In some cases, the bureau even helped the gangsters
by leaking information to them about ongoing investigations.
Recent court testimony shows the deflected cases ranged from the momentous
to the mundane, but the consistent thread running through most of them is the
involvement of Bulger's handler, former FBI agent John Connolly of South
Boston.
Some potential cases that went nowhere:
In 1982, a wise guy turned FBI informant was gunned down after Connolly,
according to testimony, told Bulger and Flemmi that the man had implicated
them in a string of gangland slayings and the murder of an Oklahoma
businessman.
In 1984, a Boston police detective told Connolly that Bulger and Flemmi
were trying to seize a liquor store owned by the detective's relatives with a
``can't refuse'' offer. But Connolly did not report the incident to superiors
and, within days, Bulger sent word to the victims that he knew they had
complained to the FBI and warned them to ``back off.''
In the late 1980s, FBI agents John Newton and Roderick Kennedy failed to
document or follow up on a realtor's claim that a gun-toting Bulger threatened
to stuff him in a body bag if the realtor didn't pay him $50,000.
In 1988, another FBI agent, supervisor John Morris, who had pocketed
$7,000 in payoffs from Bulger, warned Bulger and Flemmi that the FBI had
tapped the telephone of a Roxbury bookmaker who worked for them. While
indictments resulted from the wiretap, including some Boston policemen for
taking payoffs, Bulger and Flemmi went untouched.
Although there is evidence that Connolly protected Bulger and Flemmi, he
was not alone. Supervisors and fellow agents often were swayed by his claim
there was insufficient evidence to target the pair or that they were too
valuable to the FBI.
For example, FBI agent James Blackburn testified he never pursued
allegations that Bulger was shaking down a South Boston drug dealer in 1988
after Connolly told him it wasn't true. And agent James J. Lavin III testified
that in 1987 he ignored evidence that city workers erected guardrails on
private property outside the South Boston liquor store controlled by Bulger
after Connolly reminded him that Bulger was an indispensable informant.
In the end, Bulger and Flemmi were always suspects, but never defendants;
always informants, never targets.
Last April, Connolly refused to testify at federal court hearings exploring
the FBI's controversial relationship with Bulger and Flemmi, citing his Fifth
Amendment right not to incriminate himself. In interviews, he has accused
other agents of lying when they testified critically about his handling of
Bulger and Flemmi.
``I'm not a rogue agent,'' Connolly said recently. ``Anything I ever did, I
did lawfully. I have no trouble with what I did. I did it for the FBI, all the
way to D.C. , constant oversight.''
But the record now shows that the deal -- protection for information --
left the bureau shortchanged, co-opted, and compromised.
In a telling aside during recent testimony, one of Connolly's closest
associates in the bureau, former agent Nicholas Gianturco, talked about
entertaining Bulger and Flemmi at his Peabody home. ``I felt comfortable
having them to the house,'' he said. ``It was not an adversarial
relationship.''
All together in one room
It was an improbable convergence of characters that put two of the region's
top prosecutors under the same roof in Dedham with three gangsters while the
hoodlums were extorting the owner of the establishment across the room.
In late 1976, then-Norfolk County District Attorney William Delahunt had
just ordered dinner at the Back Side Restaurant and was awaiting the arrival
of Martin Boudreau, a law school classmate and federal prosecutor, when he
looked up to see another old acquaintance approaching his table.
It was Johnny Martorano, a well-known gangster who had attend

Red Sox No glory, just guts
After what Francona's endured, managing the Sox will be easy
By Jackie MacMullan, Globe Staff | February 13, 2004
He wished he could sleep soundly, because the interview the following morning was important to Terry Francona. Very important. He tried to lie down, hoping to minimize the searing pain in his chest, but when he did, his breathing became shallow and labored, so he bolted upright in his Seattle hotel room in the fall of 2002, alternately frightened and disgusted. As a sharper, more insistent pain jabbed his arm, he began to doubt how he was going to get through the night."I was thinking, `Aw, you've got to be kidding,' " Francona said. "I came all the way out here to have a heart attack? I should have just done that at home."He contemplated driving himself to the hospital, but he quickly noticed that as long as he sat up, the pain diminished and his breathing improved. So he paced all night, sleepless in Seattle, revisiting his strategy to become the next manager of the Mariners."I was restless, so I did something that probably wasn't that smart," Francona said. "I went to work out. I rode the bike, did some push-ups. I got to the interview an hour and a half early, because I ran out of things to do."By the time he sat down opposite Mariners president Pat Gillick, the pressure in Francona's chest was mounting. He hoped Gillick didn't notice his wiping away the sweat that kept collecting on his forehead. Could Gillick tell that Francona was actually gasping for air between sentences?There was something wrong, no doubt about that. Francona hadn't felt right since he underwent arthroscopic surgery the previous week to clean out particles and fragments in both knees, unwanted souvenirs of a 10-year major league career diminished by two grisly injuries. He had learned to fight through pain, the kind that required 8 to 10 rolls of tape every game just to hobble onto the field.He needed to fight through this, too. Francona couldn't pass on this opportunity with Seattle. He had interviewed days earlier for the manager's position with the New York Mets and it had gone fine, but not so fine that Francona felt he had the job. He missed baseball. He missed it desperately, even after the fans in Philadelphia had booed and mocked him, slashed his tires and crossed the street with the express purpose of insulting him. He lost 97 games in his final season as the Phillies' manager in 2000, but that was nothing compared to the humiliation of being told his services were no longer needed. He knew what he was doing. Why did they give up on him?"I didn't understand how much I loved the game until it was taken away from me," Francona acknowledged. "It killed me not to be in baseball."
Yet his efforts to return to the game nearly killed him as well.Bouts of adversityThe new manager of the Boston Red Sox cheated death four times during a medical odyssey that included multiple knee surgeries, blood clots, staph infections, massive internal bleeding, and a near amputation of his leg. Francona was so ill during the Christmas of 2002, the mere thought of managing a baseball team was ludicrous.
