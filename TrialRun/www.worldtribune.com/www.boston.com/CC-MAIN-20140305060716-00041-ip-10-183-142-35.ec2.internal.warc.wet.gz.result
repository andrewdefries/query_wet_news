In Response to Re: A Peak at Things to Come??? 5 Reasons Kessel will be sorely missed.:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: A Peak at Things to Come??? 5 Reasons Kessel will be sorely missed. : REALLY??? who was the 40 goal scorer on the penguins last year? as for trytobearit, you cannot say that the caps are simply a superior team after ONE GAME....that might be the stupidest (and thats saying something) thing you've said so far. By your reckoning since we can tell so much after one game chances are that our only goal scorer this season will be Bergeron. He will have 82 goals, and nobody else will have a single one.Posted by dkrejci46[/QUOTE]You just don't get it and never will. I'm not basing my assesment on last night's game. I'm looking at their team in general and saying: they're better than the Bruins. And I'll be proven right at the end of the season while you're still making excuses and trying to insult people to make yourself feel important. You have chosen to ignore posts from cashmuney49.

In Response to Re: A Peak at Things to Come??? 5 Reasons Kessel will be sorely missed.:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: A Peak at Things to Come??? 5 Reasons Kessel will be sorely missed. : Get your own. Funny how all that post-season hardware didn't mean didley-squat for the only trophy that matters: The Stanley Cup. Individual awards and stats mean zip when your team has holes and gets KO'd in round2 of the playoffs(funny how that didn't show up in your post.) Believe what you want...I'm so sick of these arguments and anyone who doesn't drink the Kool-Aid of "our team is AWESOME" is somehow being not a real fan. I guess Cubs fans who b*tch about their team not winning the WS in over 100 years aren't real fans either even tho' they watch each and every game every year. yeah, I guess only "real" fans are the ones who just believe a team that did nothing to get better in the offseason and couldn't get out of round 2 last year AND lost their top goal scorer is just magically going to get to the finals THIS year. you know what? 6 months from now when the B's are gone again from the playoffs after a round or 2 at best you and your insults will be nowhere to be found--or you'll be joining the chorus of rationalizers making more excuses for why the B's didn't win.....again. Have fun watching all the 3-2, 2-1, and 1-0 losses this team will suffer this year. But hey, at least they'll have one of the best goals-allowed averages in the league. See if you can lobby for a parade down City Hall for that come June.Posted by TryToBearIt[/QUOTE]Notice how I mentioned that I didn't think the Bruins were the best team, only that I thought they we're one of the better in the East. Ok... I didn't mention how the Bruins were "bounced" in the second round... but don't you think that the Bruins are going up hill. Why can't they get some credit for getting the organization back on track. It all has to come back to Phil Kessel. Why do Tim Thomas, Zdeno Chara and Claude Julien's individual performances mean "didly-squat" yet Phil Kessel's 36 goal are like the Holy Grail. Sort of contradicting if you ask me. As far as me drinking "kool-aid" no thanks I'm all set. I'm follow the team like most follow the sox and pats around here. I actually the game more than the team. I was perfectly content having two hockey games to watch on TV last night. It just drives me nuts that Chiarelli has done sucha great job and people still whine. Oh.... and get a life

The Bruins actually looked scared of the Caps speed/scoring ability in the last 2 periods, the way the d-men backed in all the way to the goal line on Cap rushes and the forwards stood around and marveled at their passing ability!If you can't get pumped up for your home opener and sustain intensity for 60 minutes, you are going to have major issues with good teams.Can anyone logically explain what Byron Bitz brings to the table besides being big.....slow, can't check or fight and most ECHL players have more scoring ability/ I guess CJ likes him cause he can find the weight room! Dump Wheels to 4th line and get Marchand up here to skate with Savard NOW!!!

In Response to Re: A Peak at Things to Come??? 5 Reasons Kessel will be sorely missed.:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: A Peak at Things to Come??? 5 Reasons Kessel will be sorely missed. : You're spot-on in this assessment, but don't expect any of the wishful "thinkers" here to look at your correct call objectively. I too listened w/disbelief at all the theories that missing a potential 40-goal scorer like Kessel won't matter b/c all the rest of the squad will just automatically play better and pick up the slack and score an extra 5-10 goals each. Utter nonsense. Also, the pollyannas never addressed the fact that the same teams the Bruins were about even with or worse than last year (Flyers, Devils, Caps, Pens,'Canes--and no, i'm not talking about the meaningless regular season point total, i'm talking general quality of the squads) have either upgraded their teams or come back just as strong this year--while all you can say about what's radically changed with the Bruins is that they lost their top goal scorer. The only chance they have at getting anywhere come playoff time is convincing a team like Atlanta to part w/a guy like Kovalchuk (or some other team w/an equally high impact sniper) for those high draft picks we got for Kessel. Otherwise get ready for another round 2 KO if not round 1.Posted by TryToBearIt[/QUOTE]I think the problem here is that those 'pollyannas' assume that a bunch of young players will greatly improve, and that Sturm will play as he has in the past.You seem to think that the likes of Bergeron, Wheeler, and Lucic have had their performance topped out, and what we saw from them last year is as good as they will ever be.Surely there must be some middle ground?

Ovechkin gone in Rd. 2 Hossa is no longer on Detroit. Richards, Parise and Nash were all gone in Rd. 1. Kovalchuk and Vanek didn't even make the playoffs.How about 35-goal scorers. Healty out, Marleau Rd. 1, Cammalleri and Iginla Rd. 1, Ericcson out, Kessel Rd. 2 and Malkin won the CUP. Just a dumb comment.The B's and Caps lost in Rd. 2 because of Defense.

http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/thebuzz/2012/07/tim_thomas_writ.html"I stand with Chick-fil-A". Chick-fil-A is privately owned by the Cathy family. The company president, Dan Cathy, drew the wrath of gay rights advocates and supporters when he made recent statements that some have alleged are anti-gay.Cathy told Baptist Press that the company was unapologetically in favor of traditional marriage.“Guilty as charged,” he said. “We are very much supportive of the family – the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.”In a separate interview on the Ken Coleman Show — Cathy suggested that the nation could face God’s wrath over the redefinition of marriage.“I think we are inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, ‘We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,’” Cathy said. “I pray God’s mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we would have the audacity to try to redefine what marriage is all about.” I read the bible wich may surprise many of you but I don't agree with everything in it. My only question is how would Tim react if one of his kids or other family members would were gay? When I was young I was your typical teenager and regretfuly looking back would make comments I am not proud of now. As I got older a family member told me he was gay and guess what I don't think any less of him didn't change a thing still love my uncle like heck. I honestly wonder if TT would feel the same way if he faced a similar situation in his family.

Killa........I have been posting for awhile here.......I understand the 17pts....maybe the Pats weren't rushing the QB because of the WR sets in the Bills game. Sanchez is new.....but if we give him time...he may hurt us. Like AP said....this will demoralize these guys if we win...just want to see it happen.

In Response to Jets to Embarrass Pats: I am not one to suport running up the score but in this case the coach is a jok and the the whole idea or trash talking just makes me think of Pop warner. I hope brady plays the whole game and just keeps bombing the end zone. Players shoot their mouth off and when they get spanked they don't have to own up to their comments. GO PATS SPANK the fat pig and make him cry to his momma

I don't think he is quite as injury-prone as you indicate. He sat a lot in Anaheim because Scioscia did not like his defense as a catcher. This is a non-factor now... Im Ok with this revised deal but Notin, im not exactly sure why some are saying its a great deal...the guy is obviously in rough shape....im pretty sure he didnt give himself 90% pay cut because he just loved the thought of playing for the sox...Mike Lowell redux? C'mon Geo, you know that's BS. Right now it appears to be an AAV paycut of $13m to $5m, and that's before incentives. You don't help your case by manipulating numbers, you hinder it. the agreed to contract was 3 years at 39 million....not one yr at 13 mil..i really have no idea what you are trying to point out...napoli not only agreed to drop his yearly salary, but cancel out the other two years of his agreed to contract....why? lets get real here.... Because it became common knowledge that he is a huge injury risk , which completely changed his market. It also didnt help Napoli that Texas had signed AJ and Berkman and Sea had withdrawn all interest. His market was flipped upside down. Ben knew this and held the line. Although I would have probably preferred 2/20 , with the second yr voided if he goes on teh DL with a hip injury at any pt in the first year. There is a strong possibility that by July, we are wishing that we stuck with 3/39. His career OPS is second highest on the team! Behind only Ortiz. Under no circumstances should anyone look back and wish we took that deal. Its not worth the risk of being stuck with an albatross for two years more than we should have. Sure, his hip may not act up at all for three years, but you can't use 20-20 hindsight to judge what has been done. This is the right thing for the Red Sox at this time. Even if Napoli puts up great numbers this year, when the franchise is competitive again in 2015 or so he will easily be replaced. Finally, the problems with the team are not about hitting. Until the pitching is fixed we are going nowhere. [/QUOTE]Completely agree that this is the right deal for right now. And that its not fair to use hindsight to critique the deal at a later date. However, after the Beltre year, didnt you wish that we had him for a second yr at the same price? How about Ross? Im a big fan of Napoli's attitude and bat. I was just pointing out the possibility that he plays 130 games and mashes. Leaving us wishing that we had him locked up for another yr. Of course, this doesnt mean that we should criticize Ben as 1@5 is a much better deal right now.

I see him becoming the next Kevin Youkilis! High OBP, and no spot to play... Hopefully he doesn't ride the bench like Youk did for so many years...

In response to chickenandboose's comment: I see him becoming the next Kevin Youkilis! High OBP, and no spot to play... Hopefully he doesn't ride the bench like Youk did for so many years... He's at least a year away from consideration for spot on the big club and has yet to accend to AAA. if he's a legit prospect, he'll likely begin the 2014 season in AA and if he rakes early on then by years end be in AAA...realistically we're probably looking at 2015 at the earliest before he even gets a cup of coffee In the bigs...

The thing about free agency is that it doesn't matter too much when you bring a guy up. You want his best 6 years. A 15-year career is nice, but years 7-15 is at league value and often beyond that. You have chosen to ignore posts from southpaw777.

Not a concern right now or for next year. By 2015 I imagine he could get some playing time, so we have over a full year to see Middy and Xander. 1b/3b and LF are options. Marerro could be in the mix around that time as well...All good problems to have.
