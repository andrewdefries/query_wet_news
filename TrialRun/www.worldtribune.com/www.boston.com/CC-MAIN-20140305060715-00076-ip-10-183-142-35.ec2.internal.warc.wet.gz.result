OKC is really good. I can't see anyone in the West beating them this year. Well done drafting, and then keeping their players....

In Response to Re: Oh Yes, it is possible to trade Carl Crawford, big contract and all!:[QUOTE]I think I would move Youk sooner than later. He REALLY is a 1st baseman now and looks pretty creeky at 3rd. And, we don't need a 1st baseman. But then...who plays 3rd? as for Crawford, I think he'll be good/better next year, after he does well in this year's playoffs. Remember...Yaz had 2 of fyears in the middle of a HOF carreer, and folks were after his hide!Posted by PetesCall[/QUOTE]I'd say Yaz had 15 off years, but otherwise agree with you.

Every time someone defends a player who struggles he is an "apologist" or a "pink hatter."This would make me an "apologist" for the following players and coaches:Pedroia , early in his rookie year.Ortiz , the two Aprils he struggled.Jon Lester,during one of his rough stretches.Varitek, last two seasons.Manny Ramirez, although you could never actually say he "struggled" as a Red Sox.Mike Timlin.Julio Lugo.
