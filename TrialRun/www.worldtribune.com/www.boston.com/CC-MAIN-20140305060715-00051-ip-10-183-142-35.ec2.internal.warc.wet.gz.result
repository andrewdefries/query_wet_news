Wow! St. Cloud St., Yale, Quinnipiac and UMass Lowell! Did anyone predict this frozen four? As the season went on, we knew they were good teams but after MN crushed BC, I thought they would move on. This is exciting and I hope hockey fans all over enjoy this run.
Final four, I have lost interest. I root for Syracuse(hard to say) because our one local kid.

Lowell for me.The "other" final four - UL, mostly because Pitino is a UMass kid.

Why? Given the health issues of Jones, Edelman and Amendola, and the fact that Jenkins is washed up, why not take it thru camp and see how it plays out? Smart WR. Great hands. Not saying he makes the team but lets see how it plays out in camp? No?

I just don't think he has a chance, so this makes sense. Assuming we keep 6 WRs (including Slater), I think they will be Amendola, Dobson, Jones, Boyce, Edelman, and Slater (unless on of hte UDFAs can force one of these guys out).

In response to SindarinEribor's comment:[QUOTE] In response to seabeachfred's comment:[QUOTE] In response to SindarinEribor's comment:[QUOTE] Pros: Napoli might have the highest ceiling of any first baseman on the market, given the 1.046 OPS he posted in a tremendous 2011. Even in his less impressive seasons, he has shown the kind of patience the Red Sox now lack in the lineup. He has long owned Boston pitching and Fenway Park, with 15 homers in 38 career games against the Sox and seven in 19 games at Fenway. (Fun with math: Both of those numbers extrapolate to a roughly 60-homer season.) His defensive versatility -- he's spent most of his career as a catcher -- would give Boston added depth behind Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ryan Lavarnway. Cons: That 2011 season appears to be an outlier: Napoli hasn't hit above .273 in any other year. The fact that he's primarily served as a catcher will likely make him more attractive to teams that have bigger holes at that position, potentially driving up his price. Further, while Napoli's production is well above-average for a big-league catcher, it is subpar for a first baseman. Should the Red Sox pursue? Yes, but only on a shorter-term deal. Even in Napoli's down season in 2012, only David Ortiz among Red Sox posted a better walk rate. Napoli had the same on-base percentage as Adrian Gonzalez did during his time in Boston. [/QUOTE]Sin---if the alternative is for the gutless and spineless Cherington to regign the worthless and miserable James baLoney, then yes, Napoli or anybody would be an improvement. That goes for Gomez as well since by the end of the season he was terribly exposed along with his miserable fielding. Personally, I think we should think long range here---try and trade for Ike Davis, who I heard might be available for trade since the Mets want to put Lucas Duda there. [/QUOTE] ) CBS Sportsâ Jon Heyman reported that Metsâ first baseman Lucas Duda fractured his wrist moving furniture. That could mean Ike Davis, the Metsâ other first baseman, who figured to be a prominent trade target of the Red Sox and other clubs, will be taken o
