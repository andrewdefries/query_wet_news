In Response to Re: Celtics vs. Lakers - Thread to end all Threads on this subject:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: Celtics vs. Lakers - Thread to end all Threads on this subject : Do you have reading comprehension problem? Obviously you do. I said: "You know John Wooden wasn't even #3 in championships in college sports?" # championships won in college: #1 - Al Scates (19), John McDonnell (19) Dan Gable had 15. So there are at least 3 people ahead of Wooden. Any other questions? Of course, if someone is going to count BC and BU's 9 hockey championships, then Al Scates' 19 championships at UCLA would blow them away...Posted by MajicMVP[/QUOTE]But he is #1 in college basketball championships - so who the heck cares about Al Scates? Pat Summit is #2, by the way!
