Suburban theater for the week of Dec. 14-20

"The Radio City Christmas Spectacular": The Rockettes have entered the digital age â€” their show now features a 50-foot LED screen and even more fabulous visual effects. But the greatest effect of all remains the high kickers themselves, celebrating 85 years of showing off in style for the holidays. (Well, not the same dancers, of course.) This all-new show features visits to beloved seasonal locales such as Santa's Workshop and Times Square, as well as the classic "living Nativity" and the Parade of the Wooden Soldiers.
