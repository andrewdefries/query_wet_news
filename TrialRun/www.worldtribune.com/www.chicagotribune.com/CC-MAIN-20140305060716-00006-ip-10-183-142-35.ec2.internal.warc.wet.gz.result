Planning your trip to Lake Mille Lacs, Minnesota
By Angela Frucci
December 14, 2008
Advertisement
THE BEST WAY TO LAKE MILLE LACS From LAX, Northwest offers nonstop service to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $400. It's a 90-minute drive to Isle and Lake Mille Lacs. You can find a good map at www.macstwinbay.com/loca.
WHERE TO STAY Fish house rentals for most resorts begin the third week of December and continue until the last day of February. Resorts on the south to northeast shores of Lake Mille Lacs are easier to access from the Twin Cities.
Mac's Twin Bay Resort, 43469 Vista Road, Isle,
