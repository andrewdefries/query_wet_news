Irish don't disappoint in great college spectacle
Some things defy explanation, like No. 1 Notre Dame finishing 12-0 and playing for its first national title since 1988

LOS ANGELES â€” Manti Te'o raised both arms and looked to the sky as he separated himself from the pack of teammates celebrating Notre Dame's 22-13 victory Saturday night over USC at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
They still were celebrating when Te'o returned after his victory lap to join the fun. Back in South Bend, they might be celebrating this one for ages. A couple of hundred die-hard Domers left in the stadium provided a glimpse of the glee to come an hour after the game as ESPN's "GameDay,'' wrapped up.
"Epic!!'' the loudest voice shouted. "Who's No. 1? Who's No. 1?''
Resoundingly, Notre Dame still is.

As the ball dropped out of the hands of USC fullback Soma Vainuku in the end zone on fourth-and-goal from 1 with 2 minutes, 33 seconds left, this seemed like one of those things. Naturally, Notre Dame would clinch its biggest game in 19 years with a goal-line stand. How fitting.
Notre Dame reached the pinnacle of the college football world again thanks to a passionate SEC-styled defense, a power running game and a quarterback focused on protecting the football. The Irish did it behind 148 tough yards from running back Theo Riddick, five field goals from unsung-hero kicker Kyle Brindza and a defense that limited USC to 281 total yards. They did it Alabama-style, and anybody who thinks this Notre Dam
