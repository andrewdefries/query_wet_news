‘Survivor: One World’ names a winner; Chris Hemsworth welcomes daughter
By Sarah Anne Hughes
“Survivor: One World” named a winner Sunday. (Spoilers follow, natch.) Bridal shop owner Kim Spradlin took home the $1 million prize. “I strategized until I was blue in the face,” the 29-year-old said of her win. (Associated Press)
Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth.

“The Avengers” actor Chris Hemsworth and his wife Elsa Pataky welcomed a daughter Friday. The couple named her India because they “love the country,” according to the actor. I probably would have went with Billion, but India is nice, too. (USA Today)
Oh, you haven’t heard? “
The Avengers
” passed the $1 billion mark at the international box office after adding $103.2 million domestically to the total this weekend. (Associated Press)
George Lindsey, the actor best known for playing Goober Pyle on “The Andy Griffith Show,” was remembered at a public memorial service Friday in Tennessee. Andy Griffith sent a statement to the service that read in part, “George was a better joke teller than me, and I will say here that I `borrowed’ jokes from George that he may have `borrowed’ from Minnie Pearl.” (Associated Press)
An actor makes the leap from “Downton” to Broadway, after the jump.
Cousin Matthew from “Downton Abbey” (whose real name is Dan Stevens, if you insist on calling him that) has joined Broadway’s “The Heiress.” The play will also star Jessica Chastain. (AP) Here’s photos of Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel kissing at a Lakers game, if you’re into that sort of thing. (Huffpost)
Watch clips from new NBC shows, including “1600 Penn” and “Next Caller,” at the link. (Deadline)
Lifetime has picked up a reality show centered on family members of the late Whitney Houston. Yes, this includes Bobbi Kristina. And yes, this sounds like an awful idea. (TV Column)

The week ahead in traffic, transit
By Robert Thomson
Late this week, most road work will end as travelers head away from Washington for their Memorial Day holidays. But visitors heading to the nation’s capital should be aware that the transit authority will close four stations on the Blue and Orange lines in the District, which could affect their plans to reach various weekend events.
The Capital Weather Gang sees a chance of thunderstorms each day through Sunday, with summer-like temperatures. Here are some of the traffic and transit challenges you will encounter through the week.
Gas prices
Here’s what AAA says: Gas prices continued to retreat, pulling back from the projected $4 season high this week. The national average price of regular grade gasoline was $3.89 a gallon on Friday, down 9 cents from last week, but $1.05 higher than year ago prices. Prices at the pump remain 22 cents below the all-time record of $4.11 set in summer 2008.
“Motorists continue to enjoy victory, albeit slow in coming, at the pump as gas prices continue to retreat just in time for the long-anticipated Memorial Day holiday weekend,” said John B. Townsend, AAA Mid-Atlantic’s manager of public and government affairs.
“Have we seen the gas price peak for summer 2011? Analysts say we have, which is welcome news for motorists. Yet of the projected 34.9 million Americans set to travel next weekend, 70 percent say they will compensate for higher fuel costs by cutting other areas of their travel budgets in order to usher in the unofficial start of summer with a holiday weekend get away.”
Online chat today
We can talk about weekend plans for drivers and transit users — or any other local travel issue that’s on your mind — at noon today, during my regular Monday chat. Here’s a link to the chat.
HOT lanes shift
Drivers on the western side of the Capital Beltway in Virginia are used to lane shifts designed to accommodate the work zones for the High Occupancy Toll lanes project, but here’s a new one. All four lanes of the Beltway’s inner loop are shifted to the right from after the Braddock Road (Route 620) overpass to near the Little River Turnpike (Route 236) interchange. Night time on Beltway
Watch for these overnight closings on the Beltway that also are part of the HOT lanes project.
Outer loop at I-66: Tuesday through Thursday, starting at 9:30 p.m., one Beltway lane will close at I-66, progressing to a full closing after 11 p.m. for steel beam placement. The I-66 westbound ramp to the outer loop and the left I-66 eastbound HOV ramp to the Beltway will also be closed. Follow detour signs.
Inner loop at I-395: Each night through Thursday, starting at 9 p.m., one Beltway lane will close at I-395, progressing to a full closing of the inner loop after 11 p.m. Motorists will be detoured to I-395 north to Exit 2, Edsall Road, follow signage to I-395 south, and take Exit 1D, I-495 north. All lanes will reopen by 5 a.m. Beltway/Telegraph Road
Drivers also should watch for a new traffic pattern at the Telegraph Road bridge over Cameron Run. On northbound Telegraph Road, there should be on fresh asphalt just east of the old northbound lanes from Len­ore Lane to the new part of the bridge over Cameron Run. The exits to Eisenhower Avenue and the Capital Beltway’s outer loop will be reconfigured for this shift, managers with the Wilson Bridge project say.
The project, which involved rebuilding four Beltway interchanges including Telegraph Road, is in its final stages. But on such a long and complex program, that still leaves more than a year of work. The reconstruction of Telegraph Road and the Beltway lanes should be substantially done by fall 2012, although some wrap-up work could continue until late spring 2013.
Andrews gate closing
The National Park Service plans a temporary closure on Suitland Parkway at the North Gate exit ramp to Andrews Air Force Base today through Sept. 30 to accommodate a runway reconstruction project.
Drivers should use the Main Gate, Pearl Gate or the Virginia Avenue gate during the closing.
Metrorail’s weekend
Stadium-Armory Station, Capitol South, Eastern Market and Potomac Avenue will be shut from 10 p.m. Friday through the midnight closing on Monday night, Memorial Day. There will be no service on the Blue and Orange lines between Federal Center SW and Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road.
Jim Hughes, Metro’s planning director for such maintenance activities, said Friday that Stars & Stripes & Spokes, the four-day motorcycle festival at RFK Stadium, is a new factor for Memorial Day weekend, with an unknown impact on transit and traffic.
But he was confident in the ability of the free shuttle bus system that Metro sets up to bridge interruptions in service on long weekends. Rail service on the western side of the disruption, the Mall side will be as it normally is on weekends.Trains on the eastern side of the lines are scheduled to run 25 minutes apart.
The centerpiece of the long-planned Memorial Day weekend work is the replacement of four track switches at the Eastern Market Station. Such projects are so complex that they require three days of continuous work to complete. The logistics of creating a safe work space, setting up the train lines to operate in separate sections and providing shuttle buses to bridge the gaps result in the closing of more than one station.
Metro also plans some Memorial Day weekend maintenance that will require Red Line trains to share a track between Friendship Heights and Grosvenor from 10 p.m. Friday through Memorial Day.
They also will share a track at various locations between Judiciary Square and Takoma from 10 p.m. Friday through the midnight closing Sunday.
Humpback Bridge
FAQ: When will be reconstruction of the George Washington Parkway bridge be done? The National Park Service says the project is in its final stage and scheduled to be done in late spring. In the meantime, watch out for the shortened merge from the 14th Street Bridge onto the northbound parkway.

Commonwealth Transportation Board delays vote on study containing Tri-County Parkway
By Jeremy Borden, E-mail the writer
The board that oversees transportation decisions in Virginia has delayed a vote that some say would have further advanced a proposed parkway connecting the counties of Prince William and Loudoun.
The Commonwealth Transportation Board was scheduled Wednesday to accept a study examining the North-South Corridor, which includes the so-called Tri-County Parkway, a proposed 10-mile thoroughfare that would connect I-66 in Prince William to Route 50 in Loudoun. The corridor also includes the area west of Route 234 to I-95.
But the CTB has moved off the vote. Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton said in an interview that some had overemphasized the importance of the CTB vote, which would have accepted a study that includes localities’ long-range plans for transportation, including the proposed parkway. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) had sent a letter just before the CTB meeting to Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) saying that the state needed to be more transparent and slow down its efforts.Connaughton said he hopes that recent opposition to the project would subside once residents and officials realize the parkway’s benefits. “The [parkway] will be a major benefit to the residents of western Prince William,” Connaughton said. “Our studies show that Route 15, 234 and 29 ... will become overwhelmed by traffic in the next 20 years. People are concerned about traffic now. They will be screaming about the tens of thousands of cars that will be stuck on these two-lane roads.” The decision to delay the corridor study comes as controversy around the issue has escalated in recent weeks. Wolf said in his letter that he had “serious reservations” about the road. He outlined several potential problems, including that it would open up Prince William’s protected rural area — called the Rural Crescent — to development, and that it would be paid for in part with tolls.He also said that Dulles International Airport officials have told him that claims made by state transportation officials about the road’s ability to increase cargo movement to the airport are not true. “Believe me, every time there’s a problem with the airport, they come here,” Wolf said in an interview.John E. Potter, president of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, signed a letter this week proclaiming the airport’s support of the project. Further, MWAA officials said in a statement that the proposed road would be a boon for both counties.“While enhanced access to Dulles International Airport would have a positive impact on the airport, the much bigger benefit from the proposed project is the improved mobility and economic development the project will provide the region,” MWAA said in a statement provided by spokesman Christopher Paolino. “Anything that increases mobility and economic development in the region is good for the airport. This is a road to jobs for Prince Williams and Loudoun counties.”Dan Scandling, Wolf’s chief of staff, said that the airport’s argument has little to do with moving cargo. “The whole issue is back to transparency. What is this project for?” he asked. “You kept hearing this talk of cargo ... apparently that is not the case. It is being sold for one thing when it may be something else, and that is not fair to anyone in the process.” Wolf said the state should develop a “cost-benefit analysis” of the road and other potential projects to improve transportation congestion before moving forward. “More public hearings must be held and more citizen input must be received before any final decision is made,” Wolf wrote to McDonnell. “I have seen the reaction of Prince William residents. What will Loudoun’s residents say as planning continues?”State transportation officials have scheduled a meeting for residents to weigh in at the Hylton Performing Arts Center on June 3 from 6 to 9 p.m. The parkway’s supporters, particularly the business community in both Prince William and Loudoun, say the road would create jobs and drive area economic development, ease congestion and provide a key connection between two rapidly growing counties.Wolf is the latest Republican to voice opposition to the parkway. Six state Republican legislators announced last month that they oppose the road for many of the same reasons Wolf does. The parkway’s detractors have become increasingly worried about the road’s renewed prospects given new dollars for transportation made possible through a sweeping transportation bill passed this year.

Masters 2012: Tiger Woods has fond memories of Augusta National as he readies for his 18th Masters
Video: On the heels of ending a 30-month PGA tour victory drought, Tiger Woods said Tuesday he's excited about playing the Masters, which begins Thursday at Augusta National.
By Barry Svrluga, E-mail the writer
AUGUSTA, GA. — Tiger Woods told a story Tuesday, and it is worth noting, because Woods is not exactly half of golf’s Brothers Grimm. Gather round, then, and pull up a chair.
“I played with Jack and Arnold on Wednesday in ’95,” Woods said at Augusta National. A practice round in his first Masters, when he was still a teenager, half a lifetime ago. This was before the Jack in question (Nicklaus) said that Woods would win more green jackets than he and the Arnold in question (Palmer) combined (10). This was before Woods won the first of his 14 major championships. This was when potential hardly seemed a burden, when it only brought possibilities.
Video
The Washington Post’s Barry Svrluga previews the Masters and discusses Tiger Woods’s resurgence heading into the first major of 2012 at Augusta National. That day, Palmer asked if the young Woods would like to put some stakes on the game. “Well, I don’t have any cash,” said Woods, still an amateur. “Don’t worry about it,” Palmer said. “Just play hard.”That day, Woods yapped away on every hole. “What do you do here? What do you do here?”“I’m sure they got sick and tired of me,” he said.As a storyline, the evidence — television ratings, attendance, Q-rating — suggests the golf-watching public simply doesn’t tire of Woods, love him or loathe him. They didn’t when he wore a Stanford cap and stayed in the Crow’s Nest, the room atop the clubhouse that serves as home to any amateur entrants. And they don’t now that he’s 36, now that he will open his 18th Masters on Thursday. The circumstances have changed, because he is now the one dispensing tips, the legend to be tagged along with. His intentions, clearly, have not.“I’m here for the green jacket,” he said Tuesday.That seems a reasonable assessment. More so than in 2009, when he played here in his first major championship since missing more than half a year after reconstructive surgery on his left knee and leg. More so than in 2010, when this served as his first tournament following a self-imposed layoff following a sex scandal. More so even than last year, when Phil Mickelson was the defending champion, and Woods lagged behind, still in the midst of rebuilding his swing, winless since November 2009.But on the first weekend of March, Woods shot the best final-round score he’s ever had, a 62 that put pressure on leader Rory McIlroy to close the Honda Classic. He was, there, “starting to hit shots where he would hold it against the wind or drive it with a little bit more shape on it,” said Lee Westwood, a playing partner that weekend, “where you need to have total control.”Woods then answered any further questions — about his health, the state of his game, his mental fitness — by crushing the field at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in his most recent appearance. That win, his 72nd on the PGA Tour, resonates here.“I think it’s a huge win for him to be successful this week,” Mickelson said. “I think it really increases the opportunity, because it gives him a lot of confidence and it makes being in that situation after having already closed the deal a lot easier to do.”And then, Mickelson offered the remark that shows Woods might really be back. “Sucks for us,” he said, chuckling.This Masters could be the tournament when golf returns to its previous reality, one in which Woods contended in nearly every major, when his pursuit of Nicklaus’s record 18 major titles was a weekly discussion. Tuesday, as he hit shots on the range here, his work with Sean Foley — the previously obscure coach with whom he began working in late 2010 — seemed complete. Woods has repeatedly described his swing overhaul as a “process”; he did so again Tuesday. Still, it’s clear he believes his game is, in some ways, better than when he was at the height of his powers.“Consistently, with this kind of control, it’s been a few years,” he said. “But as far as having the speed and the pop in my game” — essentially, the length and power — “it’s been a very long time. I think I have more shots than I did in 2000.”In 2000, Woods won three majors. Yet from the outside, that doesn’t seem an absurd notion. He is, certainly, longer. He can shape the ball more consistently. “We could all look at Tiger’s swing [two years ago] and see five or six or seven things that we didn’t like, and so would the great instructors,” said former Ryder Cup captain Paul Azinger. “But if you look at Tiger’s swing now, if you were picky, you might find one or two. . . . He is more fundamentally sound now than he was before he had the accident.”If that’s true, then his status as the favorite seems appropriate. Since his last Masters title, even with his physical and personal problems, he has finished no worse than tied for sixth. That includes ties for fourth each of the past two years. From the 2002 U.S. Open through the 2004 PGA Championship, Woods played in 10 majors without winning one — previously the longest drought of his career. This is the 11th major Woods has played since his most recent victory, the 2008 U.S. Open. The spell seems likely to break at some point. “One thing is for sure about people that are winners,” Westwood said. “When they get back into the situation of trying to win a tournament, they know how to generally finish it off.”That day back in 1995, Woods hadn’t yet finished anything off. His practice-round playing partners had combined for 25 major titles. Woods was two years from taking his first. The story that day ended with Nicklaus, Palmer and Woods on Augusta’s par-3 course, messing around for nine more holes. He listened to Nicklaus.“I thought, ‘You know, I never looked at it that way,’ on some of the holes,” Woods said.Some day, that may be Woods, hanging on to memories rather than creating them. But he is here this week feeling as if he has much more of a story still to tell, and many more years to tell it.
