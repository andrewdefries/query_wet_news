Another vote for same-sex marriage
By Washington Post Editors
There may be another vote on the D.C. Council in support of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in the District. Nine council members are co-sponsoring council member David A. Catania's (I-At Large) same-sex marriage bill. Council members Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7), Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) and Harry Thomas Jr. (D-Ward 5) were the only members not supporting the legislation. But at Monday night's committee hearing on the bill, Thomas indicated that he will probably vote for the bill if some tweaks are made to guarantee that religious organizations do not have to participate in same-sex marriages.
"I speak to the fact that while we may have very strong personal beliefs on an issue, as a legislator, we must look at how the law is enacted on civil and human rights issues," Thomas said. "I have held fast to my commitment that marriage equality is one that can be performed and we can move forward as a city."
Thomas, who is up for reelection next year, could face some political pressure in his district if he votes for Catania's bill. Some of the most fervent critics of same-sex marriage in the District reside in Ward 5, including several advisory neighborhood commissioners. But Northeast Washington also has a growing gay and lesbian population. Thomas's support could be a huge boost to same-sex marriage proponents. With his support, every council member representing areas west of the Anacostia River will be behind the legislation. But it appears doubtful that supporters will be able to achieve a unanimous vote. Alexander was spotted at a rally religious leaders held on Sunday to demand that a referendum be held on the issue. Several speakers singled out Alexander for praise for sticking with them. Barry could be more of a wild card. He was the only council member to vote against the bill legalizing same-sex marriages performed in other states, and he has publicly stated since then that he does not plan to vote for Catania's bill.
But Barry can be unpredictable, and vote-counters often don't know what he'll do until the moment arrives. Some same-sex marriage supporters speculate that Barry, a longtime supporter of gay rights, might flip to their side at the last minute if they frame the issue as a history-changing vote that could bolster his legacy. -- Tim Craig

Mark Davis defines his role with Raiders, says L.A. move is possible
By Cindy Boren
Reggie McKenzie is in charge of football operations, with owner Mark Davis in the background.

When Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis died, it wasn’t immediately clear what kind of owner his successor, his son Mark, would be.
“Change happened on Oct. 8,” Davis said, referring to the death of his father, “and we had to bring this full-round.”
Davis has taken big steps with the team this week. He introduced Reggie McKenzie as the team’s new general manager and agreed with McKenzie’s first decision to fire coach Hue Jackson. In his first public moments, Tim Kawakami writes, “Davis was the star of the show, with his own style — relaxed, wry, spontaneous, patient through some tedious questioning, direct and cagey, too.
Mark Davis begins putting his stamp on the Raiders.
(Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP)
There will be changes — and among them is the possibility of relocating the team to Los Angeles if it cannot get a new stadium in Oakland.
“Yeah, Los Angeles is a possibility,” he said after the formal press conference. “Wherever’s a possibility. We need a stadium.”
On other topics, Davis said his father had left no specific instructions, but “I used to talk to my dad every night.”
Al Davis had a coaching background, something his son does not have. What kind of owner he’ll be is not yet know, but he said he has listened to advice from John Madden, Ron Wolf and Ken Herock. There’s no doubt, though, about the hierarchy.
“Reggie’s going be running the show there,” Davis said. “But we will consult quite a bit. We will be talking a lot. That’s about all I can say on that.”

More Predator drones fly U.S.-Mexico border
View Photo Gallery — Unmanned drones are patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border in larger numbers in an effort to crack down on illegal immigrants. By William Booth, E-mail the writers
CORPUS CHRISTI, Tex. — In the dead of night, from a trailer humming with surveillance monitors, a pilot for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency was remotely flying a Predator drone more than 1,000 miles away.
From an altitude of 15,000 feet, over the desert ranchlands of Arizona, the drone’s all-seeing eyeball swiveled and powerful night-vision infrared cameras zeroed in on a pickup truck rattling along a washboard road.

Mexico's ongoing drug war continues to claim lives and disrupt order in the country. Gallery
From the devastating tsunami in Japan to Osama Laden’s death, here are the world events that made headlines in 2011. “Hey, where’s that guy going?” the mission controller asked the drone’s camera operator, who toggled his joystick, glued to the monitors like a teenager with a Christmas morning Xbox.This is the semi-covert cutting edge of homeland security, where federal law enforcement authorities are rapidly expanding a military-style unmanned aerial reconnaissance operation along the U.S.-Mexico border — a region that privacy watchdogs say includes a lot of American back yards.Fans of the Predators say the $20 million aircraft are a perfect platform to keep a watchful eye on America’s rugged borders, but critics say the drones are expensive, invasive and finicky toys that have done little — compared with what Border Patrol agents do on the ground — to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, drug smugglers or terrorists. Over Arizona, the Predator circled a ranch, as unseen and silent as a hunting owl. On a bank of computer screens, the monitoring team watched the truck, which appeared in ghostly infrared black and white, turn and pull up by a mobile home. In the yard, three sleeping dogs quickly woke up, their tails wagging.“Welcome home,” one of the agents said.
A popular security solution
Eight Predators fly for the Customs and Border Protection agency — five, and soon to be six, along the southwestern border. After a slow rollout that began in 2005, drones now patrol most of the southern boundary, from Yuma, Ariz., to Brownsville, Tex.For supporters, Predators are the new, sexy, futuristic fix for immigration control. They are irresistible to border hawks and the “Drone Caucus” in Congress, who consider the aircraft a must-have technology to meet the threat of spillover violence — yet unrealized — from Mexican drug cartels.Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.) has said that the drones are so popular that a Predator could be elected president. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) pronounced domestic drones “invaluable.” Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) called them “ideal for border security and counter-drug missions.” Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a GOP presidential contender, argues that the solution to security along the frontier is not a border fence but more Predators.
In his trips to testify on Capitol Hill, Michael Kostelnik, the retired Air Force general and former test pilot who runs the Office of Air and Marine for the CBP, said he has never been challenged in Congress about the appropriate use of domestic drones. “Instead, the question is: Why can’t we have more of them in my district?” Kostelnik said.Planning documents for the CBP envision as many as 24 Predators and their maritime variants in the air by 2016, giving the agency the ability to deploy a drone anywhere over the continental United States within three hours.The drones, though operated by the CBP, have been deployed to assist sister law enforcement agencies. This month, the Los Angeles Times reported that Predators were used in North Dakota to help police run down a trio of ordinary crime suspects in a cow pasture.These unarmed Predator B’s are the same as the aircraft known for lethal hunter-killer missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, except they don’t carry the missile package.One of the first Predators deployed by the border service crashed in 2006 when its remote pilot, a contractor for the plane manufacturer General Atomics, turned off the engine by mistake. The plane missed a residential area by 1,000 feet as it plunged.U.S. protocols require the drones to stay on the American side of the Rio Grande. “We don’t do Mexico,” said Lothar Eckardt, director of the Homeland Security Department’s National Air Security Operations Center in Corpus Christi.But the aerial platforms do peer a little over the fence into Mexico.What can they see? “We can see cows, pigs, coyotes, sometimes rabbits,” Lothar said. “At 20,000 feet, you can see windshield wipers, you can see if a person is running or walking, you can see backpacks sometimes. We can see Border Patrol, but not their uniforms, and so we can communicate with them and say, ‘Wave your arms,’ and that way we can distinguish between our guys and the bad guys.”
Privacy and cost concerns
Privacy watchdogs are concerned about the use of drones over domestic airspace. “The loss of privacy is real. You want to sunbathe in the nude on your own property? Now you can’t be sure nobody is watching you,” said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. “Americans will have to wonder if our enthusiasm for catching illegal immigrants is worth sacrificing our freedoms.”U.S. courts allow law enforcement to conduct surveillance from helicopters and airplanes, and privacy protections end when the public ventures outdoors. The domestic Predator’s surveillance cameras do not allow them to see through windows.Despite its initial reluctance, the Federal Aviation Administration allows the drones to fly a high-altitude corridor along the Mexican and Canadian borders but forbids them over congested urban areas — for safety, not privacy, concerns. Because of the orientation of the runway at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, the Predators are grounded when the wind direction requires them to pass over a neighboring suburb.The mission over the Arizona ranchlands last month was typical. The Predator was searching for scouts who hide in the brush and signal with a cellphone when smugglers can attempt to cross with a load of marijuana or humans. The drone did not find any scouts that night. The night before, however, they helped the Border Patrol in Texas capture a dozen illegal migrants.The Predators reached a milestone in June, having flown 10,000 hours. The Homeland Security Department reported that their drone operations have led to the apprehension of 4,865 undocumented immigrants and 238 drug smugglers since the program began.Those numbers are not very impressive. A total of 327,577 illegal migrants were caught at the southwestern border in fiscal 2011, meaning the drones have contributed only to a fraction of arrests.With an hour of flight time costing $3,600, it costs about $7,054 for each illegal immigrant or smuggler caught, based on numbers calculated from a recent Government Accountability Office report to Congress. The government has spent $240 million buying and maintaining its domestic drones, not including their operation.It is hard to put a dollar value on the services the Predators can supply, Kostelnik said, citing as an example a scenario in which a nuclear reactor, like the one in Japan damaged by the earthquake and tsunami in March, needed to be inspected from the air.“What is the value of a ‘can’t be seen, can’t be heard’ technology when you absolutely, really need it?” Kostelnik said. “The unmanned aircraft does things nothing else can do.”The authors of the GAO report were not so sure. They highlighted an obscure program called “Big Miguel” run by the Joint Task Force North out of the Army’s Biggs Field in El Paso that leased a piloted Cessna with an infrared sensor that cost $1.2 million for the year and assisted in the capture of 6,500 to 8,000 undocumented immigrants and seizure of $54 million in marijuana, according to defense officials. That would make the Big Miguel cost per illegal immigrant caught about $230. “Congress and the taxpayers ought to demand some kind of real cost-benefit analysis of drones,” said Tom Barry, director of the TransBorder Project at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank, who has studied the domestic Predator program. “My sense is that they would conclude these aircraft aren’t worth the money.”

Ship carrying containment dome arrives at oil spill site

By Marc Kaufman
Thursday, May 6, 2010;
10:34 AM
PORT FOURCHON, LA. -- The 125-ton cylinder that BP hopes will control the underwater oil geyser threatening the Gulf Coast arrived Thursday morning at the site of an offshore rig's collapse.
Later in the day, the 40-foot-tall containment dome will be lowered by a huge crane onto the spouting wellhead.
Although a containment dome has never been used so far below the surface, the company that made it -- Wild Well Controls -- believes that this one can capture and then pipe up to waiting tankers a substantial amount of the oil that would otherwise be released to the sea.
Given the large and steady stream of oil coming out from the rupture, the well-being of thousands of Gulf Coast residents and countless creatures that live in the hyper-fertile region depend on the dome's success.
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry tried to moderate expectations that the containment box would be a silver bullet.
"I know we are all hoping that this containment system will work, but I want to remind everybody that this containment system is a first of its kind deployed in 5,000 feet of water," Landry said, according to the Associated Press.
The waters at the spill site were calm Thursday morning, the AP reported. A spokesman for BP, which is working to contain the oil spill, told the news service that the drop of the dome is expected after noon Thursday.
The dome is the latest of a broad range of techniques being used to staunch the oil leak, created by the explosion of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon Rig on April 20, killing 11 workers.
The launch Wednesday night of the gleaming cylinder from Port Fourchon, an industrial hub at the very southern tip of Louisiana, captured the uneasy balance of forces at work here, where the marshlands hit the sea.
The barge inched away from the Wild West yard along a canal flanked by cranes, discarded oil rigs, tank farms and endless barbed wire -- a gas industry outpost of heavy equipment and hard-hat men. Helicopters come in and out regularly to the port, and oil rigs are visible on the horizon. The dome, which was used in shallower waters during Hurricane Katrina, was modified at the Wild Wells yard. Two more are being prepared.
The barge then traveled the Bayou Lafourche to the deeper waters, passing some of the most fertile marshes in the nation -- where fish and crustaceans of all kinds flourish in the rich outflow of the Mississippi River. One side of the bayou is an industrial park; the other side part of a national park.
The road down to Port Fourchon runs alongside another bayou, now filled with hundreds of fishing boats. They supply a significant percentage of the nation's seafood, but are now unable to go out to work. Even the harshness of Port Fourchon cannot eliminate the fertility of the land: Drainage ditches filled with trash and garbage still are alive with crabs and schools of darting fish.
While fishermen have been vocal in their dismay about the spill, the army of workers at Port Fourchon were officially mum as the dome moved out. Wild Wells referred all questions to the Unified Command Deepwater Joint Information Center many miles away in Robert, La., and workers from companies nearby said they were told not to speak with reporters.
One man, however, offered this reminder: "You know," he said, after speaking on the condition of anonymity, "we have as much riding on this as the fishermen and beachfront folks. If this can be controlled, we go back to business like before. If it creates a big mess, we're in big trouble for quite a while."
