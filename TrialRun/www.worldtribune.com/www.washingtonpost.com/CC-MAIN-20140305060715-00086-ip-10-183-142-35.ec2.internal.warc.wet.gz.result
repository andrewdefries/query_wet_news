Putin gives patriotic speech, while Prokhorov raps on state television
By Elizabeth Flock
It’s crunch time, and two of Russia’s presidential candidates know it. Ten days ahead of the March 4 election, Russia’s most powerful man, Prime Minister Vladi­mir Putin, and Russia’s third-richest man, oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov, are making very different public appearances.
View Photo Gallery: Since taking office in 2000, Vladimir Putin, who serves as prime minister, has vastly expanded the powers of Russia's presidency. On Thursday, Putin appeared before more than 100,000 supporters at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to give a short speech “heavy on patriotism” to a “balloon-and-banner-carrying crowd,” The Post’s Kathy Lally and Will Englund report. “We came here to say we love Russia,” Putin told his supporters. “We are the defenders of our fatherland.” The response was muted, and several men heckled Putin, but at the end there were cheers. Contrast that with a recent appearance by Russian oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov on “Projector Paris Hilton,” a comedy show that allows gentle political satire on state television. There, Prokhorov is encouraged to break out in a rap about his biggest product, a request he humbly obliges. Making the whole rapping enterprise funnier is that the product, pronounced in Russian as “yo-Mobile,” sounds like an expletive beginning with “F”- Mobile to a Russian ear, the New Yorker points out.
(Listen to Putin’s speech in English here)
“Putin talking, no one near me listening,” Miriam Elder, the Guardian’s correspondent in Russia, reported Thursday as she shot film of the scene. “I'm over the Putin rally and fully into [the] Prokhorov rap.”

House Reply to White House Trial Memorandum
Thursday, January 14, 1999	Following is the full text of the House prosecutors' reply to the trial memorandum filed by the White House on Jan. 13. The reply was filed Jan. 14. IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
Sitting as a Court of Impeachment
In Re Impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton Reply of the United States House of Representatives
to the Trial Memorandum of President
William Jefferson Clinton
I. Introduction
The President's Trial Memorandum contains numerous factual inaccuracies and misstatements of
the governing law and the Senate's precedents. These errors have largely been addressed in the
Trial Memorandum of the House of Representatives filed with the Senate on January 11, 1999,
and given the 24-hour period to file this reply, the House cannot possibly address them all here. The House of Representatives will address them further in its oral presentation to the Senate, and
it reserves the right to address these matters further in the briefing of any relevant motions. However, President Clinton has raised some new issues in his Trial Memorandum, and the House
of Representatives hereby replies to those issues. II. Facts
The President's Trial Memorandum outlines what he claims are facts showing that he did not
commit perjury before the grand jury and did not obstruct justice. The factual issues President
Clinton raises are addressed in detail in the Trial Memorandum of the House. A complete and impartial review of the evidence reveals that the President did in fact commit
perjury before the grand jury and that he obstructed justice during the Jones litigation and the
grand jury investigation as alleged in the articles of impeachment passed by the House of
Representatives. The House believes a review of the complete record, including the full grand
jury and deposition testimony of the key witnesses in this case, will establish that.
The evidence which President Clinton claims demonstrates that he did not commit the offenses
outlined in the Articles of Impeachment are cited in Sections IV and V of his Memorandum. Regarding Article I, President Clinton maintains that his testimony before the grand jury was
entirely truthful. At the outset of his argument, he states that he told the truth about the nature
and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he insists that any false impressions that his
deposition testimony might have created were remedied by his admission of "improper intimate
contact" with Ms. Lewinsky. However, his subsequent testimony demonstrates that this
admission is narrowly tailored to mean that Ms. Lewinsky had "sexual relations" with him, but he
did not have "sexual relations" with her, as he understood the term to be defined. In other words,
he admitted only what he knew could be conclusively established through scientific tests. He
denied what the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, the testimony of a number of her confidantes, and
common sense proves: that while she engaged in sexual relations with him, he engaged in sexual
relations with her, regardless of how President Clinton attempts to redefine the term.
Following this pattern, President Clinton discounts substantial evidence as well as common sense
when he maintains that he testified truthfully in the grand jury about, among other things, his prior
deposition testimony, his attorney's statements to Judge Wright during his deposition, and his
intent in providing a series of false statements to his secretary after his deposition. Again, a
complete review of the record and witness testimony reveals that President Clinton committed
perjury numerous times in his grand jury testimony.
In regard to Article II, President Clinton extracts numerous items of evidence from the record and
analyzes them in isolation in an effort to provide innocent explanations for the substantial amount
of circumstantial evidence proving his guilt. Yet when the record is viewed in its entirety,
including the portions of President Clinton's deposition testimony concerning Ms. Lewinsky and
his grand jury testimony, it demonstrates that President Clinton took a number of actions designed
to prevent Paula Jones's attorneys, the federal district court, and a federal grand jury from
learning the truth. These actions are described in detail in the Trial Memorandum of the House.
To the extent that President Clinton's Trial Memorandum raises issues of credibility, those issues
are best resolved by live testimony subject to cross-examination. The Senate, weighing the
evidence in its entirety, will make an independent assessment of the facts as they are presented,
and a detailed, point-by-point argument on these matters is best resolved on the Senate floor. The
House is confident that a thorough factual analysis will not only refute President Clinton's
contentions, but will prove the very serious charges contained in the articles.
III. The Articles Properly State Removable Offenses.
A. The Offenses Alleged are High Crimes and Misdemeanors.
1. The Senate Has Never Exercised Its Power to Dismiss an Article of Impeachment Except
When the Official Impeached Has Resigned. The House acknowledges that the Senate has the power to dismiss an article of impeachment on
the ground that it does not state a removable offense. Beyond that, however, President Clinton
completely ignores the Senate's precedents concerning the use of that power. In the fifteen cases
in which the House has forwarded articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate has never
granted a dispositive motion to preclude a trial on the articles with one exception. In the 1926
case of Judge George English, the Senate granted a motion to adjourn after Judge English
resigned from office making a trial moot on the issue of removal. See Impeachment of George W.
English, U.S. District Judge, Eastern District of Illinois, 68 Cong. Rec. 347-48 (1926). The
Senate also granted a motion to adjourn in the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson, but only
after a full trial and votes to acquit on three articles. III Cannon's Precedents of the House of
Representatives � 2443. In addition, the Senate has never granted a motion to dismiss or strike an article of impeachment. However, in the 1936 case of Judge Halsted Ritter, the House managers themselves moved to
strike two counts of a multi-count article to simplify the trial, and the motion was granted. 80
Cong. Rec. 4898-99 (April 3, 1936). However, the remainder of the article was fully considered,
and Judge Ritter was convicted on that article. The House managers in the 1986 Judge Harry
Claiborne case made the only motion for summary judgment in the history of impeachment. Hearings of the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee (Judge Harry Claiborne), 99th Cong., 2d
Sess. 145 (1986). They did so on the basis that Judge Claiborne had already been convicted of the
charges in a criminal trial. Id. The Senate postponed a decision on the motion and never ruled on
it, but it ultimately convicted Judge Claiborne. In short, the Senate precedents firmly establish
that the Senate has always fulfilled its responsibility to give a full and fair hearing to articles of
impeachment voted by the House of Representatives. 2. The Constitutional Text Sets One Clear Standard for Removal. a. There is Only One Impeachment Standard.
The Constitution sets one clear standard for impeachment, conviction, and removal from office:
the commission of "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." U.S. Const. art.
II, � 4. The Senate has repeatedly determined that perjury is a high crime and misdemeanor. Simple logic dictates that obstruction of justice which has the same effect as perjury and bribery of
witnesses must also be a high crime and misdemeanor. Endless repetition of the claim that this
standard is a high one does not change the standard. President Clinton claims that to remove him on these articles would permanently disfigure and
diminish the Presidency and mangle the system of checks and balances. President's Trial
Memorandum at 18. Quite the contrary, however, it is President Clinton's behavior as set forth in
the articles that has had these effects. Essentially, President Clinton argues that the Presidency
and the system of checks and balances can only be saved if we allow the President to commit
felonies with impunity. To state that proposition is to refute it. Convicting him and thereby
reaffirming that criminal behavior that strikes at heart of the justice system will result in removal
will serve to strengthen the Presidency, not weaken it. b. Impeachment and Removal are Appropriate for High Crimes and Misdemeanors
Regardless of Whether They are Offenses Against the System of Government. President Clinton argues that impeachment may only be used to redress wrongful public
misconduct. The point is academic. Perjury and obstruction of justice as set forth in the articles
are, by definition, public misconduct. See generally House Trial Memorandum at 107-12. Indeed, it is precisely their public nature that makes them offenses -- acts that are not crimes when
committed outside the judicial realm become crimes when they enter that realm. Lying to one's
spouse about an extramarital affair, although immoral, is not a crime. Telling the same lie under
oath in a judicial proceeding is a crime. Hiding gifts given to a adulterous lover to conceal the
affair, although immoral, is not a crime. When those gifts become potential evidence in a judicial
proceeding, the same act becomes a crime. One who has committed these kinds of crimes that
corrupt the judicial system simply is not fit to serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer.
Apart from that, the notion that high crimes and misdemeanors encompass only public
misconduct will not bear scrutiny. Numerous "private" crimes would obviously require the
removal of a President. For example, if he killed his wife in a domestic dispute or molested a
child, no one would seriously argue that he could not be removed. All of these acts violate the
President's unique responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. 3. President Clinton Cites Precedents That Do Not Apply Rather Than Relying on the Senate's Own Precedents Clearly Establishing Perjury as a Removable Offense
a. President Clinton Continues to Misrepresent The Fraudulent Tax Return Allegation
Against President Nixon.
In his trial memorandum, President Clinton argues that the failure in 1974 of the House Judiciary
Committee to adopt an article of impeachment against President Nixon for tax fraud supports the
claim that current charges against President Clinton do not rise to the level of impeachable and
removable offenses. President's Trial Memorandum at 21. The President's lawyers acknowledge
the charge in the article against President Nixon of "knowingly and fraudulently failed to report
certain income and claimed deductions [for 1969-72] on his Federal income tax returns which
were not authorized by law." Id. The President's lawyers go on to state that "[t]he President had
signed his returns for those years under penalty of perjury," Id., trying to distinguish away the
Claiborne impeachment and removal precedent from 1986, and by extension all the judicial
impeachments from the 1980s which clearly establish perjury as an impeachable and removable
offense.
President Clinton's argument that a President was not and should not be impeached for tax fraud
because it does not involve official conduct or abuse of presidential powers simply is unfounded
based on the 1974 impeachment proceedings against President Nixon. Moreover, the fact that the
President and his lawyers make this argument in defense of the President is telling. He effectively
claims that a large scale tax cheat could be a viable chief executive. It is undisputed that the Judiciary Committee rejected the proposed tax fraud article against
President Nixon by a vote of 26 to 12. A slim minority of Committee members stated the view
that tax fraud would not be an impeachable offense. That minority view is illustrated by the
comments of Rep. Waldie that in the tax fraud article there was "not an abuse of power sufficient
to warrant impeachment . . . ." Debate on Article of Impeachment 1974: Hearings of the Comm.
on the Judiciary Pursuant H. Res. 803, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess., at 548 (1974)(Statement of Rep.
Waldie). Similar views were expressed by Rep. Hogan and Rep. Mayne. Rep. Railsback took the
position that there was "a serious question," id. at 524 (Statement of Rep. Railsback), whether
misconduct of the President in connection with his taxes would be impeachable. Other members who opposed the tax fraud article based their opposition on somewhat different
grounds. Rep. Thornton based his opposition to the tax fraud article on the "view that these
charges may be reached in due course in the regular process of law." Id. at 549 (Statement of
Rep. Thornton). Rep. Butler stated his view that the tax fraud article should be rejected on
prudential grounds: "Sound judgment would indicate that we not add this article to the trial
burden we already have." Id. at 550 (Statement of Rep. Butler).
The record is clear, however, that the overwhelming majority of those who expressed a view in
the debate in opposition to the tax fraud article based their opposition on the insufficiency of the
evidence, and not on the view that tax fraud, if proven, would not be an impeachable offense.
The comments of then-Rep. Wayne Owens in the debate in 1974 directly contradict the view that
Mr. Owens has expressed in recent testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Although
Mr. Owens in 1974 expressed his "belief" that President Nixon was guilty of misconduct in
connection with his taxes, he clearly stated his conclusion that "on the evidence available" Mr.
Nixon's offenses were not impeachable. Id. at 549 (Statement of Rep. Owens). Mr. Owens
spoke of the need for "hard evidence" and discussed his unavailing efforts to obtain additional
evidence that would tie "the President to the fraudulent deed" or that would otherwise "close the
inferential gap that has to be closed in order to charge the President." Id. He concluded his
comments in the 1974 debate by urging the members of the Committee "to reject this article
...based on that lack of evidence." Id.
In addition to Mr. Owens, eleven members of the Committee stated the view that there was not
sufficient evidence of tax fraud to support the article against President Nixon. Wiggins: "fraud . .
. is wholly unsupported in the evidence." Id. at 524 (Statement of Rep. Wiggins). McClory: "no
substantial evidence of any tax fraud." Id. at 531 (Statement of Rep. McClory). Sandman: "There
was absolutely no intent to defraud here." Id. at 532 (Statement of Rep. Sandman). Lott: "mere
mistakes or negligence by the President in filing his tax returns should clearly not be grounds for
impeachment." Id. at 533 (Statement of Rep. Lott). Maraziti: discussing absence of evidence of
fraud. Id. at 534 (Statement of Rep. Maraziti). Dennis: "no fraud has been found." Id. at 538
(Statement of Rep. D
