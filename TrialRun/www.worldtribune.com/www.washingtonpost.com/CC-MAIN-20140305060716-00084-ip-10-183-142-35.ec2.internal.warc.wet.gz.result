Black Redskins fans loyal, despite loathsome start
By Robert E. Pierre

(John McDonnell - THE WASHINGTON POST)
The Washington Redskins franchise gave black Washingtonians plenty of reasons to loathe them. They were marketed as the “Team of the South.” The band played “Dixie,” a nod to Old South nostalgia.
There was no mention, of course, of the lynchings, the Ku Klux Klan or any of that unseemly business of denial of an education and basic human rights. But there didn’t need to be. The message was clear. The Redskins were the last segregated National Football League team.
But when the team finally relented in 1962, and began signing black players, the tide began to turn. These players became the team’s ambassadors who turned around the image of a franchise that didn’t want or deserve the support of the region’s black residents.
Fast forward 50 years and the transition is complete. A new Washington Post poll found that two-thirds of African Americans have a favorable view of the team and four in 10 feel that way “strongly.” Less than half of white fans have an overall favorable view of the franchise.
The early black players—Bobby Mitchell was the first—were embraced as barrier breakers, similar to those staging sit-ins, going to jail while protesting and staging so-called Freedom Rides down South.
”A lot of us at the time were fighting for integrating cafeterias, schools and other places and Bobby was integrating the Redskins, so we rooted for him,” said Steve Thompson, owner of Georgina’s (aka Players Lounge) in Congress Heights, told the Post.
Residents cooked dinner for the players, invited them into their homes and lined up to shake their hands. And why wouldn’t they? These young men could have been their sons or brothers, just looking for an opportunity to get ahead. Then, professional football players still lived and walked among the people. They didn’t make loads of money. And those players, despite their semi-rock-star status, were just as susceptible as other black people to the racial slights of the day.
When Lonnie Sanders arrived a year after Mitchell, he and another black player went apartment hunting in Northwest.
“We looked in a place called the Executive House on 16th Street back in ‘63,” Lonnie Sanders, now 69, told my colleague Chris Jenkins. “A woman told us: ‘We don’t have any vacancies.’ Well we left, saw some other couple go in, a white couple. They gave them a place to stay. We wound up staying in Southwest.”
But it wasn’t just that initial wave of Redskins that made an impression with black residents. Who can forget that magical run in 1988 when Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory. Temporarily, because of Williams, the Redskins--for many black people--became a national team.
Here’s a telling fact from the Post poll: 10 percent of black sports fan consider Williams the greatest sports figure in the city’s history. Less than one percent of white fans named Williams.
Times have certainly changed, and many of the biggest barriers have been broken. Black quarterbacks and coaches are no longer an oddity. And a black man now resides in the White House.
Certainly, there are unresolved issues of fairness and equity in our society. But the goodwill the Redskins now enjoy with black fans harkens back to an earlier more nostalgic time when our communities were closer, when solidarity was needed just to survive and when a pro player you didn’t know might stop in for dinner.
Those memories seemed to have tamped down the hate that existed prior to 1962, when the team was still pining for the gentility of the Old South--where batons, police dogs and venom ruled the day.

Michelle Singletary
Columnist
With your personal finances, do this — not that
By Michelle Singletary, I rarely think in shades of gray when it comes to personal finance issues.
Yet because personal finance is so personal, some experts are leery of telling people, without any equivocation, what to do with their money. But offering a long list of pros and cons often leaves people unsure of what to do. My goal is to never leave you on the fence. Archive

When paying off debt, gain strength by starting small
Michelle Singletary Getting rid of your smallest balances first can give you momentum.
It’s for this reason that I’m recommending “Worth It . . . Not Worth It?: Simple & Profitable Answers to Life’s Tough Financial Questions” by Jack Otter as the July selection for the Color of Money Book Club. Otter, the executive editor of CBS Moneywatch.com, shares my aversion to shades of financial gray. Everyday, he writes, we face questions about our money. Most of these questions, he believes, can easily be answered. “I’m not suggesting it’s easy to get ahead financially,” Otter notes. “What I am telling you is that there are right and wrong answers to most of the financial decisions life throws at you, and given the necessary information it’s fairly simple to figure out which is the right call. Money is a very emotional subject, and we often get tied up in knots when wrestling with financial questions.”I love how Otter tackles common financial decisions in a “do-this, not-this” format. • Save for retirement now or later? “I know that in your 20s you feel as if you have no money, but consider this: You have no mortgage, no children, and before you know it, neither of those things will be true. Last year I made 13 times the salary I was paid for my first job. And my disposable income? About the same. . . . Put a little cash away. Your 65-year-old self will thank your 25-year-old self.”• New or used car? “A car loses a whole lot of value in its first two years of life, and the smart-money move is to let someone else pay that depreciation.”• Buy or lease a car? “Buying a car is a better deal than leasing. . . .Leasing a car is like always going to the more expensive restaurant, or making sure you never, ever, pick up an item at the sale price.”• Stock or mutual fund? “It’s no contest: mutual fund. Reasons not to buy individual stocks: The deck is stacked against you. Institutional investors, with their human and computer armies, constitute about 70 percent of the volume of the New York Stock Exchange. That means the guy on the other side of the trade knows more than you do. (And even he usually can’t beat the market.)”• Take or decline the rental car insurance? “One word: Decline. If you want to be polite, make it, ‘Decline, thank you.’”• Term life insurance or permanent life insurance? “You need a term policy. The bottom line is this: Permanent life insurance is a lousy investment for 99 percent of the population.”• Allowance vs. pay for chore? “Don’t tie it to chores. Instead, teach your children that certain tasks are simply part of being a household; after all they won’t get paid for making their beds as adults.” • Cheat or stay faithful? “Stay faithful. Few events can torpedo your financial plan like a divorce. To all the other reasons that you stay faithful to your wife, add one more: a single night’s slip-up could easily cost you a million bucks over your lifetime.” Otter lays out his advice in six chapters: Getting Started, Shelter, Automotive, Investing, Family Matters and Retirement. Each financial question within the chapters is quickly covered in two pages, often with great photos or smart graphics to make his point. His glossy-page hardback is crafted to read like a coffee-table book that you can flip through and read in an hour. What’s also appealing is that the financial issues aren’t dealt with in the ad nauseam detail that typically befuddles people reading personal finance books. And although Otter gives straightforward answers, he still offers brief pros and cons of certain choices. I don’t agree with all of Otter’s answers. But I’m with him on the majority of what he recommends. Whether you agree or disagree, he tidily answers the most common personal finance questions with refreshing clarity.I’ll be hosting a live online discussion about “Worth It . . . Not Worth It?” at noon Eastern on July 26 at washingtonpost.com/conversations. Otter will be joining me to answer your questions.

Incoming Mexican President Peña Nieto looks to reshape dialogue with U.S.
Video: As Mexico’s new president prepares to take office, The Post’s Mexico bureau chief William Booth talks about what Enrique Peña Nieto’s administration might mean for Mexico and the U.S.
By William Booth and Nick Miroff, E-mail the writers
MEXICO CITY —
On the eve of his inauguration and his party’s return to power, Mexico’s incoming president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has vowed to reshape his country’s education, business and energy sectors in ways that could have profound effects on the United States.
Peña Nieto, a dynamic politician from an old autocratic political party, has said that he wants to change the conversation about Mexico in the United States, away from headless torsos and drug cartels to trade and manufacturing. Gallery

Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. 40 more maps that explain the world
Max Fisher I’ve searched wide and far for maps that can reveal and surprise and inform in ways that the daily headlines might not.
Together with the United States, Peña Nieto and his top advisers say, Mexico wants to drill more oil, assemble more cars and build “better, faster, smarter bridges” to increase the $1 billion-a-day commerce across the 2,000-mile border, the busiest crossing in the world.Peña Nieto, who takes office Saturday, and his team say they are ready to help the Obama administration and the U.S. Congress implement a guest-worker program to regulate the flow of Mexican labor to the United States, where an estimated 6 million Mexicans live illegally.But his top aides said Peña Nieto hoped to create an economy that is competitive enough to keep more Mexican workers at home.“Some people joke that the fence should actually be higher, because, seriously, we are going to need all the workers we can get if the economy is growing at 5 or 6 percent,” said Emilio Lozoya, a former manager of a billion-dollar investment fund in New York who will head Mexico’s national oil company.After meeting with Peña Nieto in Washington on Tuesday, President Obama called the plans “very ambitious” and promised that the bilateral relationship would grow.A lifelong politician, Peña Nieto, 46, has pledged to lift 15 million Mexicans out of poverty, essentially reducing the ranks of the country’s poor by a third. He promised that half of all college-age Mexicans would be enrolled in higher education, up from less than 30 percent today, one of the lowest figures among developed Latin American countries.And Peña Nieto said he would cut the murder rate by 50 percent during his six-year term, in a country where more than 100,000 homicides have occurred in the past six years.Peña Nieto won a bruising election with only 38 percent of the vote in a three-way race.
Cabinet announced
Many Mexicans remain suspicious that Peña Nieto’s fresh face masks the darker ambitions of his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico between 1929 and 2000 with a mix of corruption, vote-rigging, crony capitalism and coercion.“Enrique Peña Nieto and his team are an enigma. No one knows what he really stands for,” said political analyst Sergio Aguayo.But Peña Nieto says past is not prologue. He has surrounded himself with a coterie of bright, ambitious aides educated at top universities, including MIT, Harvard and Oxford, and who are successful in business, government and academia.On Friday, he named his cabinet, pulling in close allies to run his finance and interior ministries. He also reached across the aisle, making a former leftist mayor of Mexico City his new minister for social development and naming a top member of the opposition party as his foreign secretary.“To his credit, Peña Nieto knows what he doesn’t know and has named individuals who have the knowledge that he doesn’t possess,” said George Grayson, an expert on Mexican politics at the College of William and Mary.“We need a more equitable economic environment,” said Luis Videgaray, a former investment banker and academic known as “El Doctor” who is Peña Nieto’s right-hand man and was named as finance minister. “Our current system favors the wealthy. It’s very difficult to be an entrepreneur in Mexico.”Videgaray said his boss says it is time to be less ideological, more practical. “The economy is performing well. We need to keep economic stability, but it’s not enough. We need to do things to enhance productivity,” he said.
Adjusting security priorities On security, Peña Nieto says he is not backing down in the fight against organized crime but will shift the government’s priorities from killing drug cartel bosses to bringing down the murder rate. With governors from the PRI controlling 21 of Mexico’s 31 states, the new president will be in a far better position to push the sweeping reforms that eluded outgoing President Felipe Calderon, whose administration was bogged down by the U.S.-backed drug fight. Peña Nieto wants to shutter local police departments, whose poorly paid officers often share pistols and are overwhelmed by gangsters. They would be replaced by state police under more centralized command.The incoming president also envisions a reassignment of Mexico’s federal police force, which swelled under Calderon from 6,000 officers to more than 35,000. Peña Nieto has said that he will add 35,000 officers to its ranks but would not use them as Mexico’s primary anti-drug agency.Instead, a crime-fighting force modeled after the French National Gendarmerie will be created to gradually bring Mexican troops back to their barracks, Peña Nieto says.His advisers describe the gendarmerie as a paramilitary hybrid armed with military-grade weapons but trained to think and operate like police investigators. They will be deployed to Mexico’s crime hot spots but will be accountable to the central government, not local authorities.Peña Nieto is in talks with Paris about sending French advisers to train the new force.“The core element is reducing violence,” Lozoya said. “We need more people going to jail rather than getting killed.”Videgaray also said that Peña Nieto wants to “help facilitate” immigration reform in the United States, including a new temporary-worker program that would be “crafted by both sides.”“It is up to the U.S. to decide,” Videgaray said. “But we can help.” The new president also wants to open up the national oil company, known as Pemex, to international partnerships, which would require a constitutional amendment. He is especially keen to lure U.S. energy companies to help Mexico exploit its oil reserves in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and its shale oil deposits along its northern border.Mexico is thought to have the fifth-largest reserves of shale gas in the world but lacks the technology and know-how to tap in.Mexico’s powerful oil workers union has blocked such a move. But as the leader of a party with historical links to the union, Peña Nieto is expected to have far better chances of engineering energy reform legislation than his predecessor.
