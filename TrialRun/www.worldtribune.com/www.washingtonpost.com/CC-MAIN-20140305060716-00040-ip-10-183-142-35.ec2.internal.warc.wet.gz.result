The University of Virginia's big problem
By Valerie Strauss
An accrediting agency has put the University of Virginia on "warning" for violating rules during last summer's leadership crisis, and the school's provost says U-Va.'s governing body is working on the problem. The problem is: The board can't work out the problem because the board, or at least the leadership, IS the problem.

McPherson on slavery and Virginia's governor
By Valerie Strauss
Civil War expert James McPherson says that Virginia Gov. McDonnell had it wrong when he indicated that slavery was not “most significant” for Virginia as an issue during the Civil War period. Let's hope Virginia's student learn Civil War history the way McPherson teaches it.

Action on D.C. ‘living wage’ bill puts Wal-Mart plans in doubt
jstampfl/c.o. A&R Companies - A rendering of the more-modern design for the Wal-Mart planned for East Capitol Street. East Capitol is on the left; a private entrance to the development is on the right.
By Mike DeBonis and Jonathan O’Connell, E-mail the writers
The D.C. Council’s preliminary decision to require the city’s largest retailers to pay a “living wage” has put Wal-Mart’s plans for the District in doubt, setting up a difficult veto decision for Mayor Vincent C. Gray.
The council voted 8 to 5 Wednesday to impose a super-minimum wage of $12.50 an hour — well above the District’s regular $8.25 minimum— on retailers reporting at least $1 billion in annual corporate revenue and operating in spaces of 75,000 square feet or more. A second and final vote is scheduled for July 10.

The Debate Watcher
DISTRICT OF DEBONIS | An ongoing feature reviewing D.C. mayoral candidate forums ahead of the election. Read more
The bill — backed by organized labor and other advocates for workers — would affect stores already operating in the city, including Home Depot, Macy’s and Costco, which would be required to comply within four years. But the legislation, known as the Large Retailer Accountability Act, is generally seen as aimed at Wal-Mart, which plans to open six D.C. stores in the coming years.In public statements, Wal-Mart has declined to say how the legislation would affect its plans, other than to warn that it would have “negative consequences.” Several city officials who have been briefed by company representatives say the retailer has not threatened to cancel stores.But real estate executives familiar with Wal-Mart’s plans say that if the measure becomes law, the company would shelve plans for the three stores not under construction. That would include one at Skyland Town Center, a project near to the mayor’s heart and his home in Southeast Washington.
The council’s vote puts Gray (D) under considerable pressure because he has made economic development of underserved areas — particularly in the eastern half of the city — a priority. But vetoing a bill that would give a leg up to low-income workers could be uncomfortable for Gray, who might seek reelection next year.Gray said Friday that he had not decided whether to veto the legislation, as Wal-Mart called on him to do last week. But he acknowledged that the Skyland project — at the intersection of Good Hope Road, Naylor Road and Alabama Avenue SE — and two others will influence his thinking.“It certainly is a factor,” he said. “There’s no question about that.”Gray pressed Wal-Mart representatives at a Las Vegas retail conference two years ago to open a store at Skyland and then personally called Bill Simon, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart U.S., to ask that a store be expedited there.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, complied. The company signed a commitment with McLean-based Rappaport Cos. to serve as the top retailer in Skyland Town Center, a mixed-use project with a town square and 476 apartments. Skyland, which could break ground next year, would be the largest project built in a D.C. neighborhood east of the Anacostia River, and the city has put up $40 million in subsidies and spent $28 million on other expenses to advance it.In an e-mail, Henry Fonvielle, president of Rappaport, did not say Wal-Mart would pull out of Skyland, but he did say there “is no doubt that the [bill] will make it more difficult for developers” to attract large retailers.Gray held out the possibility that the legislation could be tweaked before the July 10 vote. “I’ve got to sit down with Wal-Mart and find out what their issues are,” he said. “See if we can find a way to, say, thread the needle.”Grant Ehat, principal at JBG Rosenfeld Retail, which is building Wal-Mart stores in Fort Totten and on H Street NW, said the measure would be more fair if it did not exempt unionized chains, such as Safeway and Giant, which Wal-Mart will compete against for grocery sales.“I can’t imagine that they will proceed on any of the unbuilt stores if this bill passes,” Ehat said.
Without Wal-Mart, Skyland lacks a critical anchor tenant, making the project unfeasible. And the legislation probably would affect other projects, such as the redevelopment of the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center campus, which Wegmans, a grocery chain based in Rochester, N.Y., has been looking at as a possible location.Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), who represents the Walter Reed area and chairs the council’s Economic Development Committee, said that she met with Wegmans representatives in May and that they brought up concerns about the bill. Bowser voted against it.The political calculations for Gray, who has received support from both business and labor, are complex. A veto, which could be overridden by nine votes, would come against the backdrop of next year’s mayoral race.Two council members who have begun mayoral campaigns, Bowser and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), opposed the bill Wednesday, citing its potential to dampen development in retail-starved neighborhoods. A third, Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), supported the bill after the council approved an amendment scaling it back. Otherwise, the measure would have applied to all retailers with $1 billion or more in corporate sales, regardless of store size.Council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), a lead backer of the legislation, said fears that the measure would drive off Wal-Mart or other retailers amounted to “crying wolf.” He said the city’s growing population and strong economy make it an attractive market for retailers, even in long-neglected neighborhoods.“The District of Columbia has arrived,” Orange said. “We don’t have to beg people to come to the District anymore. . . . At the end of the day, there is no other growth in the suburbs. The growth is in the city.”If Wal-Mart threatens to abandon Skyland or other projects, Gray should call their bluff, Orange said.“If Wal-Mart doesn’t come, someone else will come,” he said. “Trust me.”

Ethics in the age of acceleration
Michele Tantussi/BLOOMBERG - A patient is pushed in a wheelchair past the emergency check-in desk by a member of the medical staff at the Helios hospital Berlin, operated by Fresenius SE, in Berlin, Germany, on Tuesday, June 5, 2012. By Vivek Wadhwa, E-mail the writer
A 63-year old Vietnam veteran who was rendered completely disabled during service to his country was able to travel again because of a custom-made mobile-assistive device. But in October 2009, as he travelled from Miami to San Juan, Puerto Rico, the 450-pound device was damaged in the cargo hold of the plane. As a result, the vet was bedridden for more than 9 months. The airline accepted responsibility for the damage, but offered a tiny settlement—just to repair the device. They argued that his device was like an automobile or a wheelchair, so their only liability was to repair the device.
Linda Glenn, who was the veteran’s attorney, says that after extensive effort, she was able to convince the insurance adjuster that the device was an extension of his body that functioned as his lower limb and lower-torso muscle. She and her co-counsel Mark Senter argued that modern day prosthetics, which include implants, transplants, embedded devices like pacemakers, and wearable devices, are not inanimate, separate objects just like a wheelchair.

The surprising bond between a general and Silicon Valley
Justin Brady The general who leads the Air Force Academy shares tactics with Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh.
So, the airline offered a better settlement, which the veteran accepted. Glenn documented this test case in the Annals of Health Law. The names of the parties involved were changed to protect the veteran’s privacy. Advances in technology are changing who we are and what we are. Today’s bio-engineered devices and exoskeletons are just a start. Over time, they will become larger components of our bodies, playing more critical roles. As the Glenn case on human-machine mergers shows, modern-day business practices lack an understanding of changes in technology.But this is the tip of the iceberg. Preeta Bansal says that law and ethics, too, lag behind advances in technology. Bansal is the former White House general counsel and senior policy Advisor and prior to that served as Solicitor General of the state of New York. For example, she asks, how will existing rules of liability be applied when a self-driving car, such as the autonomous vehicle Google is designing, hits a pedestrian? Will robotic devices with attributes of human sentience be subject to criminal laws – either as victims or perpetrators? To what extent will individuals have the right to control the collection, maintenance, dissemination, and accessibility of private information? Bansal says that with the rise of exponential technologies—such as those in computing, medicine, and synthetic biology, we are facing the threat of exponentially increasing gaps in our legal, governance, and ethical frameworks. Profound legal and ethical issues are emerging around not only the definition of life, but also dignity, including the nature of personal privacy, the value of human labor and work in a world of artificial intelligence and robotic devices, and issues of equity and access to rapid technological change. The widening gap between the time a problem appears and the moment a legal and ethical solution can be reached creates opportunities for exploitation. Bansal notes three specific sets of issues that must be confronted before this gap can be filled. First, who should fill the governance gap — individuals, governments, or other institutions? Individuals are innovating today at a level and rate at which only governments and corporations could before. Should they also self-regulate themselves concomitantly in light of the gap? Just as innovation is becoming increasingly do-it-yourself, is there a need for greater do-it-yourself regulation to ensure the development and responsible deployment of exponential technologies? How do we develop and accelerate the mechanisms for achieving social consensus around legal and ethical norms? Second, what is the correct unit of governance? In the Internet era, will there be pressure for some decline in the nation-state as the relevant governing unit in some areas, and is that appropriate? Will other certain transnational institutions or identities (e.g., religious or ethnic) start to govern how we define the legal and ethical challenges presented by advancing technologies? In prior eras, technological changes hastened profound changes in governance – such as the printing press hastening the decline of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of the nation-state.Third, what are the correct institutions of governance? Courts or legislatures? Bansal notes that common-law courts historically have played an important role in times of rapid technological advance, because they can fashion rules based on actual individual circumstances, and allow the law to develop on a case-by-case basis – rather than trying to anticipate all scenarios as is often required when trying to enact prospective legislation.Whatever the answer to these questions, it is clear that accelerating technological change must bring about accelerating adaptation or change of legal, ethical, and regulatory norms. The invention of the printing press, the steam engine, and the railroads led to explosions in developments to the world’s governance and legal frameworks. We are on the cusp of a similar era of change.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Jackson Diehl
Deputy Editorial Page Editor
Correction:
An earlier version of this column referenced a statement by a “senior defense official” accompanying Defense Secretary Robert Gates to Jerusalem last week. In fact, the “senior defense official” made his remark during a trip with Gates to Tel Aviv. This version has been corrected. In Obama’s push for Mideast peace, whose side is he on?
By Jackson Diehl, So far what some are calling the Arab Spring has brought Israel the first terrorist bombing in Jerusalem in seven years and the first significant missile attacks from the Gaza Strip in two years. And that, for the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, is likely to be the easy part.
The hard part will be managing Barack Obama.

Course change?
Netanyahu and the Israeli army know how to deal with Palestinian terrorist attacks. Their tanks and planes have been pounding targets in Gaza, and inflicting considerably more casualties and damage than have been caused by the rockets. The Israelis believe both the Jerusalem bombing and most of the missile strikes were carried out by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a small militia controlled by Iran. Gaza’s ruler, Hamas, is thought not to want a wider conflict, much less a repeat of Israel’s devastating 2008 invasion.So barring a miscalculation by one side or the other, or a missile that wipes out an Israeli school, Netanyahu is likely to avoid major hostilities with Hamas. But what of the Obama administration and its renewed calls for “bold action” to revive negotiations on Palestinian statehood? For Netanyahu, that — more than a new Egyptian government or an offensive by Iran’s allies — may be the biggest short-term challenge emerging from the Middle East’s upheaval.A reasonable person might conclude from the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria et al., that the Middle East’s deepest problems have nothing to do with Israel and that the Obama administration’s almost obsessive focus on trying to broker an Israeli-Palestinian settlement in its first two years was misplaced. But Obama isn’t one of those persons. Instead, like several American presidents before him, he seems to have concluded that the ideal segue from the latest Arab crisis is a new attempt to pressure Israel into accepting a quick march to Palestinian statehood.A “senior defense official” accompanying Defense Secretary Robert Gates on his visit to Tel Aviv last week put it this way: “The Israelis have a very deep strategic interest in getting out in front of the wave of populism that is sweeping the region . . . showing progress on the peace track with the Palestinians would put them in a much better position for where the region’s likely to be six months or a year from now.”That’s true, of course — in theory. In practice, Netanyahu’s problem is twofold. First, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has no interest in negotiating with him, and never has. The 76-year-old Abbas has repeatedly shrunk from committing himself to the painful concessions he knows would be needed for Palestinian statehood. What’s more, he has despised and distrusted the Israeli prime minister since Netanyahu’s first term in office in the 1990s. Rather than bargain with Israel, Abbas seems inclined to go along with his aides’ plan to seek a U.N. declaration of Palestinian statehood at the next General Assembly in September.This might not be so troubling for Netanyahu, who is also not eager to make concessions for a peace deal, if not for his second problem: Obama continues to believe that Israel’s government, and not the Palestinians, is the primary obstacle to peace. The president made his mind-set clear from the beginning of his administration, when he chose to begin his diplomacy by demanding a complete freeze on Israeli settlement activity — a condition Abbas had never set but which he quickly adopted as his own. In a meeting with American Jewish leaders at the White House this month, Obama indicated that he hadn’t changed his mind. Abbas, he insisted, was ready to establish a Palestinian state. The problem was that Israel had not made a serious territorial offer. Netanyahu feels compelled to counter the Palestinian offensive at the United Nations, which his defense minister, Ehud Barak, says could turn into “an anti-Israeli diplomatic tsunami.” For that he will need the support of Obama. So Netanyahu has committed himself to deliver what could be the most-anticipated speech in Israel’s history — an address to the U.S. Congress in May in which he is to lay out a new “vision” for peace.To satisfy Abbas and Obama, Netanyahu will have to promise a significant concession. In the words of the Israeli commentator Akiva Eldar, “he will have to utter, with his own mouth, the magic words” — that a Palestinian state will be based on Israel returning to its 1967 borders. But if he does that, Netanyahu will infuriate most of his cabinet and probably cause the collapse of his coalition. His supporters believe he will also give up Israel’s best negotiating chip — territory — before the real bargaining even begins. Netanyahu felt comfortable enough with the Gaza mini-war and the state of security in Jerusalem last week to carry on with a planned trip to Russia. The coming showdown with Obama will require his full attention.

Ireland to become a test for Europe’s fiscal accord
By Anthony Faiola, E-mail the writer
LONDON — The Irish government on Tuesday declared it would hold a referendum on Europe’s freshly inked fiscal treaty, setting up a vote that could indicate whether the island nation is willing to accept years of tough austerity to remain within the euro zone.
The decision will amount to the first public test of a new accord that would seek to enforce budget discipline throughout the region, setting strict limits on state spending to restore investor confidence in the bloc’s indebted countries. Last month, 25 of the European Union’s 27 nations — all but Britain and the Czech Republic — agreed to the German-led treaty, with the nations involved now in the process of trying to ratify it.

An interactive look at the situation in Europe and how it affects you. Yet opinion polls across Europe suggest a deepening suspicion of E.U. institutions, with surveys in Ireland particularly suggesting a wide gap between the public and its leaders over the wisdom of granting more power to authorities in Brussels. While the new treaty appears to enjoy more support in countries such as Germany — where famously frugal taxpayers have been heavily tapped to bail out Greece, Ireland and Portugal — in Dublin and elsewhere, opponents say they see their sovereignty at stake.“I don’t think the Irish feel we have any sovereignty left anymore,” Shay Moran, a 41-year-old unemployed semiconductor engineer and treaty opponent, said recently at Dublin’s Gravediggers pub, where Irish revolutionaries once plotted against British rule. “All I see is [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel wielding a big stick and telling us what to do.”The move by the Irish to put the question before voters who have a history of rejecting European accords could not alone scuttle the new treaty. Although 25 nations have agreed to the new accord, only 12 of the 17 nations that share the euro must ratify it for the treaty to come into effect. So far, only Ireland has declared that it will hold a public vote.Yet Ireland’s announcement comes as doubts are swirling about the treaty’s backing in France, the region’s second-largest economy and without whose support many would see the treaty as effectively dead.In Paris, the Socialist front-runner in the upcoming presidential election, Francois Hollande, has indicated that if he were elected in May, he would renegotiate the treaty to include measures oriented toward promoting growth in European economies — something the Germans continue to strongly oppose. The Irish referendum, analysts said, amounts to a further complication to a treaty meant to prevent another European debt crisis and that was used to persuade German politicians this week to support a costly second bailout for near-bankrupt Greece.More important, a rejection of the treaty by the Irish people would put any future bailouts in jeopardy. Under a 2010 deal, Ireland is scheduled to receive rescue funds through next year. But analysts say that, like Greece, Dublin may require another rescue package — one it could effectively be barred from getting if the treaty is voted down. Ireland’s prime minister, Enda Kenny, who strongly backs the treaty, described the referendum on Tuesday as an “opportunity to reaffirm Ireland’s commitment to membership of the euro.”“The Irish people can confirm our commitment to responsible budgeting and ensure that the reckless economic mismanagement that drove our country to the brink of bankruptcy will not be repeated,” he said, laying the blame on the previous government.
Polls: Vote too close to call
European and Irish government officials had desperately hoped to avoid a referendum. Irish voters have twice rejected key E.U. treaties — in 2001 and 2008 — although both accords were ultimately approved in second referendums after Dublin won a number of concessions. Recent Irish opinion polls have shown that a vote on the new European fiscal pact would be too close to call.But a ruling by the Irish attorney general indicated that under the national constitution, Ireland could not ratify the accord without a referendum. Although a date has not been announced, the vote is expected to take place by June.The campaign to pass the treaty in Ireland, experts say, is likely to be aided by the growing realization in European capitals that the accord amounts to a paper tiger, with any harsh penalties for violators coming only after a laborious, bureaucratic process. But in Ireland, the referendum on the treaty is also likely to be seen as a proxy vote on the tough austerity imposed on Ireland by its lenders at the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank as part of a three-year bailout deal struck in 2010.Always different from the one in Greece, the Irish crisis was sparked not by runaway government spending and faked economic figures, but by a U.S.-style property bubble that led to the near-collapse of the banking system. In sharp contrast to the Greeks, since being bailed out, Ireland has been portrayed by its lenders as a model, with the Irish so far succeeding in cutting the deficit, improving competitiveness and restoring their country to growth.
Demands ‘just aren’t fair’
But many in Ireland say the recovery here looks better on paper than it does in real life, raising fresh doubts about the country’s ability to regain market confidence by the time its $112 billion bailout runs out next year. Some economists are suggesting that, like Greece, Ireland may be forced into a second massive bailout despite its recent gains.E.U. estimates suggest that Ireland’s economy grew by almost 1 percent in 2011. But that figure is pumped up by profits from multinationals such as eBay, Facebook and Google that use Ireland for its low corporate tax rates and tend to repatriate a good portion of those profits while employing only 7 percent of the Irish workforce. After stripping those numbers out, the Irish economy appears to have actually suffered a mild recession last year. Consumer spending, retail sales and bank credit have dried up with few signs of recovery. The Irish unemployment rate remains near modern highs, above 14 percent.Few in Ireland are seriously debating the need to reduce spending and close the budget gap. But opponents of strict austerity insist that a focus on deep and quick cuts, mixed with markedly higher sales and new property taxes, has hampered the nation’s return to robust growth. That, many here argue, would only continue for years if Ireland agrees to the new European treaty.For some, such as Cian Dowling, 20, a bright-eyed engineering major at University College Dublin, it has meant rethinking a commitment to education. New cuts to university subsidies mean that he will now have to pay $8,000 or more a year out of pocket for a master’s degree in a country with no U.S.-style student loan programs. Like tens of thousands of young Irish escaping dwindling domestic opportunity, he is considering a life overseas, possibly in New Zealand.“What they’re really doing is telling young people like me that we can’t get higher educations anymore,” he said. “But wasn’t a lack of education Ireland’s problem in the past?” He continued: “I feel like these demands from Europe for cuts just aren’t fair. Isn’t it better to try to help us get back on our feet rather than knocking us down again?”
