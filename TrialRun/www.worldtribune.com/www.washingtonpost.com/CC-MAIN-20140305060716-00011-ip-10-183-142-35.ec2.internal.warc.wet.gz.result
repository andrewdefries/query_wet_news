Why He MattersShah was once a top official at one of the biggest non-profits in the world. Now he runs the country's largest foreign assistance program, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Not bad for a 36-year-old with a background in medicine and business and a penchant for politics. Shah earned his M.D. and an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania. He consulted with 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore before accepting an executive position working on agriculture policy at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

In May 2009, Shah joined the Obama adminstration as undersecretary for research, education, and economics at the Department of Agriculture. Just a few months later, he was brought over to lead USAID, where he will play a key role in coordinating civilian assistance in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Just weeks into his leadership, USAID was forced to spring into action. A massive January 2010 earthquake left at least thousands dead and wounded in Haiti. President Obama vowed to be "a friend and partner" to the country, and made Shah the point person for aid efforts.In a speech, Shah said that the U.S. is focused on making an "aggressive effort" to save lives and providing food, shelter and additional aid. He will be coordinating an interagency team that includes FEMA and the Homeland Security Department.In His Own Words"We can use our lives to create positive change in the world," Shah said. "The first step is learning about the issues. Become an advocate in your own community, or use a vacation to volunteer abroad. It all starts with education."More on: Rajiv ShahAt a GlancePath to PowerThe IssuesThe NetworkCampaign ContributionsAdditional Resources

Background
At a Glance
Career History: Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics at the Department of Agriculture (June 2009 to present); Director of Agricultural Development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (2001 to 2009); Health care adviser to
Al Gore
's 2000 presidential campaignHometown: Detroit, Mich.Alma Mater: University of Michigan, B.S.E. (economics), 1995; University of Pennsylvania, M.B.A., 2002; University of Pennsylvania, M.D., 2002Spouse: Shivam Mallick ShahDC Office: U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Ave., S.W.Web site
Path to PowerShah was born in Detroit, where his father worked at Ford Motors. His parents both immigrated from India.Shah stayed in-state for college, studying economics at the University of Michigan. It was at Michigan that Shah developed a passion for international aid work, thanks to a trip to India Shah took as a volunteer with a group of doctors.

"Before that trip, it had never occurred to me that people could live in such destitute circumstances," Shah said in 2008.After graduating in 1995, Shah went on to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a degrees in medicine and business.He took time off from his studies to move to Nashville and advise 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore on health-care policy. Shah told the Penn Gazette that he "fell in love" with politics (along with his wife) during those 16-hour days on the campaign.Shah later proposed to his wife by flying to India for a day to propose to her at the Taj Mahal.Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationAfter graduating in 2002, a former colleague with the Gore campaign encouraged him to take a temporary position with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.That interim job led a to full-time stint as deputy director of policy and finance for the foundation's global-health program. In that position, Shah helped raise over $5 billion for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI), an initiative that funds childhood-immunization programs.Shah eventually pushed the organization in a new direction by lobbying to lead a division on agriculture, particularly in Africa. The foundation agreed, and Shah took over that portfolio. "When we started, developing-world agriculture seemed very much out of fashion," Shah told the New York Times in October 2008.But the Gates Foundation was a leader in changing that perception. It invested serious money in trying to reduce food shortages and redevelop agricultural markets.Obama AdministrationStill, the lure of politics was too strong. In May 2009, Shah joined the Obama administration as undersecretary of agriculture for research, education and economics and cjhief scientist. To prepare for the gig, Shah told the Seattle Post Intelligencer that he read Team of Rivals, a history book on Abraham Lincoln's cabinet.At the USDA, Shah worked on everything from food safety to sustainable agriculture. He also emphasized explaining the results of his research to the public. "Americans are willing to support public actions, and public institutions, but they expect results."Just a few months later, Shah was tapped to run USAID. Shah's confirmation came after nearly a year of false starts and stalls by the White House, which initially intended to tap Paul Farmer. Farmer withdrew his name in summer 2009 because of the intrustive vetting process.The delay drew criticism from several foreign policy hands, who said that Obama's vision of "smart power diplomacy" could only be realized with a strong head of USAID.In his first months in office, Shah outlined the four "core areas" USAID will address during his term - recommitting USAID to the Millennium Development Goals, investing in country-owned models of growth and development success, developing and delivering scientific and technological breakthroughs, and utilizing USAID expertise in conflict settings."Most of all, we need to change internally," Shah said. "We need to reform or eliminate processes that inhibit our success, and truly treat development as a discipline. We need to take risks, acknowledge mistakes, and harness the passion that brought us to this field."He also relaunched the policy planning shop.

The IssuesShah took over USAID at a time when the agency was gearing up to play an increasingly larger role in U.S. diplomacy. After years of budget cuts under the George W. Bush administration, the organization has become essential to the challenges in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.The role has became even more prominent as Secretary of State Clinton outlined her vision for development as one of the central pillars of diplomacy. In a January 2010 speech, she said that she is committed to "rebuilding AID as the premier development agency in the world, bar none."
Read more
At USAID, Shah will oversee a $40 billion budget and development projects in almost every country in the world. He will also supervise initiatives on global health, food security and human rights. At his swearing-in, he said that "We can elevate development to stand with diplomacy and defense as a true pillary of our foreign policy. And in doing so we can build a broad political constituency, because people want to support this work, they just want to know we can do it effectively." Agriculture as DevelopmentWhen he was at the Gates Foundation, Shah led an effort to increase global food security and sustainable farming, particularly in Africa. He did this in several ways - by partnering with researchers to try and develop high-yield, disease-resistant crops; by coming up with ways for small farms to sell their goods to more buyers; and by looking into drought-resistant crops.Shah also emphasized planning ahead for the deleterious effects of climate change on agriculture.This work won plenty of praise, but also some criticism from the likes of Raj Patel, author of a book on the world's food system. "It's hard not to feel what we're seeing is a foundation playing God in Africa." He also said the foundation puts too much faith in market-based solutions.
Show less
The NetworkShah is tapped into a network that includes former Vice President Al Gore, Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and many members of the non-profit community, like Bill and Melinda Gates.At the State Department, he'll work closely with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has called development one of the top tools in the U.S. foreign policy arsenal. He will also likely work with with Undersecretary of State for economic, energy and agricultural affairs Robert D. Hormats and Undersecretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero.

A second-hand lesson in dealing with a smoking neighbor
istockphoto - smoking
By Benny L. Kass, Second-hand tobacco smoke is not in and of itself a nuisance. That is now the law in Maryland based on a case just handed down by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
David Schuman, a shareholder in the Greenbelt Homes Cooperative, claimed that his neighbor’s smoke invaded his apartment, in violation of the cooperative’s rule that no nuisance was permitted.
In the Schuman case, it was shown that the offending smoker had already been prohibited from smoking in his apartment; he was only smoking on his patio. Neighbors had testified at the trial in the lower court that shutting their windows stopped the smoke from coming into their unit. “All Schuman would have to do to eliminate any offensive odor from the outdoor patio smoking would be to shut his window,” the court said, “and, if need be, run a small fan to clear any smoke that entered his unit.” The trial court found that Schuman did not make any effort to try that “simple solution.” Accordingly, the appellate court upheld the trial court’s ruling that Schuman did not show that the smoke “was a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of his home.” Common law
The court ruled that second-hand smoke is not a “nuisance per se.” And the court further determined that Schuman did not meet the legal standards of what constitutes a “nuisance in fact.” These are technical, legal distinctions. Nuisance per se means that the conduct is so objectionable and impacts everyone — such as pollution of the air. Nuisance in fact is something that may not affect the world, but the plaintiff has met the burden of proof that he was, in fact, injured as a result of the conduct.The law of nuisance is based on common law. According to legal scholars, the concept was developed based on the theory that a person shall not use his property so as to harm another. The legal dictionaries define it as “that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use physically uncomfortable to him.”That’s what Schuman claimed when he filed his lawsuit; the smoke impacted his health and interfered with his right — guaranteed by the cooperative legal documents — to peace and quiet enjoyment in his apartment. But he did not have an expert testify that he suffered any significant injury from secondhand smoke. At the trial, another expert was vague on how far smoke travels before it dissipates. In fact, that expert tested for nicotine in the air of the courthouse — where smoking is prohibited — and the reading was similar to the level he had detected in Schuman’s home.In this case, the burden of proof was on Schuman to prove actual harm, and not — as the court suggested — “just from an admittedly offensive odor.” Thus, in Schuman’s case, he just did not meet the burden of proof. It should be pointed out that the cooperative did take steps to resolve the problem. It sealed the cracks between the two units and also hired an industrial hygienist to test the air in Schuman’s unit.
Your options
If you are in a similar situation with a tobacco-smoking neighbor in your community association, here are some steps you can take: ●Talk with the neighbor. In the Schuman case, the smoker purchased a new air filter, which unfortunately did not work to Schuman’s satisfaction. ●Discuss the situation with your board of directors. More and more associations are enacting rules — or amending their legal documents — to restrict smoking in the common areas. There is a legal question as to whether a community association can restrict smoking within the unit itself. I believe that if the association’s legal documents — declaration and bylaws in a condominium — are legally amended to impose such a restriction, it will be upheld in any legal challenge. Case law throughout the country makes it clear that community association owners are bound not only by the rules and regulations that exist at the time they purchase their unit, but also as those documents may be properly amended from time to time.●Finally, if all else fails, you can bring a lawsuit against the smoker and the association. But learn the lesson of the Schuman case: Make sure you can document actual injury to you and that there are no other reasonable alternatives.
