On gay marriage, Mitt Romney veers hard to the right
By Greg Sargent
Mitt Romney, in a statement just now blasting the court’s ruling of Proposition 8 as unconstitutional:
“Today, unelected judges cast aside the will of the people of California who voted to protect traditional marriage. This decision does not end this fight, and I expect it to go to the Supreme Court. That prospect underscores the vital importance of this election and the movement to preserve our values. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman and, as president, I will protect traditional marriage and appoint judges who interpret the Constitution as it is written and not according to their own politics and prejudices.” That note about judges who interpret the Constitution according to their own “prejudices” — is that a reference to the fact that the judge on the case was gay, which was cited by Prop 8 supporters as proof of his bias? Naah, probably not. A major party presidential candidate would never go there.
This statement is obviously about appealing to the GOP primary electorate. But you’d think this would only provide Romney’s primary opponents with an occasion to remind those voters that back in 1994, he envisioned a world in which “full equality” reigned for gays and lesbians and said he’d be better on gay rights than Ted Kennedy:
I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America’s gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent.
I am not unaware of my opponent’s considerable record in the area of civil rights, or the commitment of Massachusetts voters to the principle of equality for all Americans. For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponents’s record in this area. But I believe we can and must do better. If we are to achieve the goals we share, we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern. My opponent cannot do this. I can and will.
What’s of particular interest in today’s statement is Romney’s claim that the court decision “underscores the vital importance of this election and the movement to preserve our values.” At a time when majorities of Americans are coming out for gay marriage, is this kind of stuff really going to be any more than a major turnoff for independents and swing voters in a general election? Of course, that question is probably moot — all will be forgotten by then. We have heard a good deal from pundits who have suggested that, hey, if Romney wins, all that stuff he does to get through the primary doesn’t really matter, he’s really a moderate at heart, etc., etc. I suppose expecting people to remember statements like this one would be too much to ask.

Sugar Bowl 2012: Virginia Tech should not apologize for the BCS embarrassment
View Photo Gallery — The drive to the 2012 Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Here’s a look back at some of the high profile games of the season. By Tracee Hamilton, E-mail the writer
Frank Beamer is right not to apologize. Why should he be the one to apologize for the embarrassment that is the BCS? His Hokies didn’t storm New Orleans and take the Sugar Bowl by force. Beamer shouldn’t have to read a list of Virginia Tech’s accomplishments over the past 16 years – to be frank, Frank, they aren’t really relevant to the discussion anyway – to try to justify his team’s bowl berth.
If this were the NCAA tournament, we might say that Virginia Tech got over-seeded. But we wouldn’t blame Virginia Tech for that – we’d blame the Selection Committee. Archive

Video: Heisman finalists named
So let’s put the blame where the blame is due – right on the good ol’ BCS and the good ol’ bowl system, which is still run by the good ol’ boys. The BCS was supposed to deal with the inequities of that system, in which teams seemed to be picked willy-nilly for the best of the bowl games (with the biggest payoffs, of course). That doesn’t seem to be working. Both Tech and its opponent, Michigan, leapfrogged some of the teams in the BCS rankings to grab the coveted Sugar Bowl spots. Michigan was selected over Michigan State despite the fact that the Spartans beat the Wolverines by two touchdowns this season. Other teams with an ax to grind include Kansas State, Baylor, TCU and perennial ax-grinder Boise State. Seriously, Boise State could clear-cut all of Idaho with all the axes it’s ground over the past few years.Baylor and TCU are not the darlings of college football, but they played one of the best – if not the best – game of the season, and Baylor has Robert Griffin III, who may now be the Heisman front-runner. And Kansas State – though it pains me to say it – is ranked No. 11 in the Associated Press poll, higher than every team in the discussion except Boise State. Bill Snyder has done a remarkable job with the Wildcats, who deserve better than they got, although their Cotton Bowl matchup with Arkansas could be one of the better bowl games. (Sorry, I need a minute here.)And don’t talk to me about travel. Sure, the Hokies and Michigan “travel well.” So does K-State (I’m actually experiencing the bends now). So would other teams, if they were ever given a chance. We’ll never know if Broncos fans travel well because they never get to go anywhere. Well, that’s not true; they get to go to Vegas, baby! What a rare opportunity. The bowl system was unfair before the BCS, and it’s unfair now. So why the devil do we need the BCS? If the bowls are going to pick and choose programs with great pedigrees over programs trying to build great pedigrees, we’re going to see the same teams play every year and that’s that. Of course, life’s unfair, and it was unfair long before we’d ever heard of the BCS. Yammering from the media and fans apparently isn’t going to change anything, but where are the conferences in all this? I’ve said it before: If they can entirely realign themselves without permission or guidance from anyone, why can’t they turn their attention to this hot mess? After all, it’s in the conferences’ best interests to ensure that their teams get the best possible bowl berths because it’s an important source of revenue for the entire conference. Forget fairness as an incentive; money should work.And apparently it has. The conferences – as soon as they are actually clear on which schools are members – will propose changes to the BCS by next summer; the current BCS contract runs out in two years. It’s probably too much to hope that these changes will include oh, say, a playoff system – the good ol’ boys would never go for it. But what if the BCS standings meant something? What if success during the regular season translated to the best possible bowl bid? Wouldn’t that be something? Until then, the blame needs to be put where it belongs – not on Frank Beamer or Virginia Tech, not on Michigan, but on the BCS and the so-called bowl system. Make them stand up and read a list of accomplishments. It would be short.

In Pakistan, at least 20 killed on day of protest against incendiary video
Video: Pakistani police opened fire on rioters who were torching a cinema during a protest against an anti-Islam film. Security forces clashed with demonstrators in several other cities in Pakistan.
By Shaiq Hussain and Richard Leiby, E-mail the writer
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan’s officially declared “Day of Love for the Prophet Muhammad” devolved into deadly violence in major cities Friday as tens of thousands of Pakistanis angrily demonstrated against an Islam-mocking YouTube video, although calm generally prevailed in other predominantly Muslim countries.
At least 20 people died and more than 150 were injured in the protests in Pakistan, authorities said — the highest one-day death toll since protests began over the video on Sept. 11. The demonstrations have spread to about 20 nations.

Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. 40 more maps that explain the world
Max Fisher I’ve searched wide and far for maps that can reveal and surprise and inform in ways that the daily headlines might not.
The government’s announced effort to tamp down anger by providing a national holiday for peaceful protest clearly backfired, offering instead what seemed like an official sanction to violence.Critics called the holiday a pandering attempt to please hard-line Islamist parties, whose influence has been on the rise here in recent years.“This was a terrible idea,” said Mehreen Zahra-Malik, a columnist with the News, a national English-language daily. “It was time to calm people down and not give a stamp of approval to protesters, many of whom would just use it as an excuse for violence. . . . There was clearly going to be violence.”Another commentator, Marvi Sirmed, said on Twitter: “It is sad, so very sad that we could never make a government realize that they don’t have to kneel before mullah,” a reference to Muslim clerics.Despite repeated U.S. disavowals of the privately made video and denunciations of its content, many Pakistanis remained unconvinced, seeing it as an intentional calumny against the prophet Muhammad.Most of the fatalities and destruction came in the southern port city of Karachi, where Saghir Ahmed, health minister for Sindh province, said 14 people died, including two policemen shot by rioters. At least 80 people were wounded, Roshan Ali Shaikh, the city’s police commissioner, said.In the northwestern city of Peshawar, rescue workers and other officials said six people were killed, including a policeman and a member of a television crew, in rampages that also left about 60 people wounded. Television journalists on the scene said police opened fire with live rounds as mobs torched two movie houses.Demonstrators also battled security forces for the second day in the usually calm capital, Islamabad, in the north. They blocked major highways there and in neighboring Rawalpindi and set a tollbooth and vehicles on fire.Fourteen police officers were injured in the chaos, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said. The Pakistani army was mobilized and successfully protected the U.S. Embassy, presidential residence and Parliament building.In the eastern city of Lahore, officials said 12 riot police officers and four protesters were injured during pitched battles involving thousands of demonstrators.The rioters in all four cities targeted U.S. diplomatic facilities but failed to reach them, thwarted by Pakistani police and paramilitary forces who had set up barbed-wire barricades and steel shipping containers to deter demonstrators.On Friday evening, as the death toll continued to climb, Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf renewed his calls for peace.“Destroying property and resorting to violence negate the spirit of Islam and teachings of the prophet,” Ashraf said in a statement.Other countries that had previously seen violence connected to the YouTube video were largely calm Friday. In Kabul, where a suicide car bomber earlier this week killed 12 people in an attack linked to the video, Friday prayers passed without incident.As he had done the previous Friday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai called on clerics to discourage protests.In Cairo, the scene last week of an assault on the U.S. Embassy over the video, just a few dozen people stood in front of the shuttered French Embassy to protest cartoons showing a nude Muhammad that were published by the French satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo.Egypt’s highest Islamic legal official said Thursday that Muslims should endure insults without resorting to violence. The country’s main Islamist parties did not call for embassy protests.But in Pakistan, where anti-American sentiment runs high, the protests gained momentum through the day.In Karachi, officials and journalists at the scene said marchers torched movie theaters, banks, American food franchises and police vehicles and pelted the Sheraton hotel with stones.Hard-line Islamist parties, including two banned factions, joined the throng, estimated to number 15,000.Abdul Ghani, a Karachi shopkeeper, said the security forces opened fire on the protesters and turned the demonstration violent. “We were completely peaceful and just wanted to register our protest in front of the U.S. Consulate,” he said. “That unwanted and uncalled-for action by the police got the mobs infuriated.”The chief mufti of Pakistan, Rafi Usmani, unavailingly urged the crowds to remain calm. “If you burn your property, vehicles, banks and police stations, whose purpose are you serving?” he said. “We all are with you to protest, but it must be peaceful.”Earlier, addressing a gathering of clerics, the prime minister said Muslim nations should press the United Nations and other international bodies to outlaw blasphemy. “Our demand is simple: Blasphemy of the kind witnessed in this case is nothing short of hate speech, equal to the worst kind of anti-Semitism or other kinds of bigotry,” Ashraf said, according to Pakistan’s state news agency.In anticipation of Friday’s protests, authorities closed gas stations and jammed cellphone service in at least 15 cities across the country. Earlier, Pakistan had blocked access to YouTube, where the incendiary video was posted.The Obama administration has purchased ads on a half-dozen Pakistani television stations to disavow the video. The $70,000 ad buy demonstrates the depth of U.S. concern about the volatility of Pakistan, where several militant jihadist groups, including the Taliban, are based in tribal areas and operate largely free of Islamabad’s authority.Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S. Embassy’s charge d’affaires, Richard Hoagland, on Friday to demand that the United States take immediate measures to remove the video, purportedly a trailer for a film titled “Innocence of Muslims,” from YouTube.“This was an attack on 1.5 billion Muslims and a premeditated and a malicious act to spread hatred and violence among people of different faiths,” ministry officials told Hoagland, according to a statement.
Leiby reported from Kabul. Haq Nawaz Khan in Peshawar, Nisar Mehdi and Aamir Latif in Karachi and William Booth in Cairo contributed to this report.

World reacts to Haiti earthquake
Humanitarian efforts have begun across the world in response to the devastating earthquake that struck near Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince late Tuesday, Jan. 12. U.N. officials say an accurate count of those killed in the 7.0-magnitude quake might never be known.
